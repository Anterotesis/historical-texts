 THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Revised and Corrected by the Author  VOL II  Homer  LONDON  Printed by  John Nutt  and sold by  John Mor∣phew  near  StationersHall  MDCCXII  TO  Edward Wortley Mountague  Esq  SIR  WHen I send you this Volume I am rather to make you a Re∣quest than a Dedication I must desire that if you think fit to throw away any Moments on it you would not do it after read∣ing those excellent Pieces with which you are usually conver∣sant  The Images which you will meet with here will be very feint after the Perusal of the  Greeks  and  Romans  who are your ordinary Companions I must confess I am obliged to you for the Taste of many of their Excellencies which I had not observed till you pointed them to me I am very proud that there are some Things in these Papers which I know you par∣don and it is no small Pleasure to have ones Labours suffered by the Judgment of a Man who so well understands the true Charms of Eloquence and Poesie But I direct this Address to you not that I think I can entertain you with my Writings but to thank you for the new Delight I have from your Conversation in those of other Men  May you enjoy a long Con∣tinuance of the true Relish of the Happiness Heaven hath be∣stowed upon you I know not how to say a more affectionate Thing to you than to wish that you may be always what you are and that you may ever think as I know you now do that you have a much larger For∣tune than you want I am  SIR  Your most Obedient and most Humble Servant  Isaac Bickerstaff  THE N  o  TATLER  BY Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  VOL II  Quicquid agunt Homines nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Thursday Aug  to  Saturday Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  The History of  Orlando  the Fair  Chap II  FOrtune being now propitious to the gay  Or∣lando  he dress'd he spoke he mov'd as a Man might be suppos'd to do in a Nation of Pigmies and had an equal Value for our Approbation or Dislike It is usual for those who profess a Contempt of the World to fly from it and live in Obscurity but  Orlando  with a greater Magnanimity contemn'd it and appeared in it to tell 'em so If therefore his exalted Mien met with an unwelcome Reception he was sure al∣ways to double the Cause which gave the Distaff You see our Beauties affect a Negligence in the Ornament of their Hair and adjusting their Head∣dresses  as conscious that they adorn whatever they wear  Orlando  had not only this Humour in common with other Beauties but also had a Neglect whether Things became him or not in a World he contemn'd For this Reason a noble Particularity appeared in all his Oeconomy Furniture and Equipage And to convince the present little Race how unequal all their Mea∣sures were to an  Antidiluvian  as he called himself in Respect of the Insects which now appear for Men he sometimes rode in an open Tumbril of less Size than ordinary to show the Largeness of his Limbs and the Grandeur of his Personage to the greater Advantage At other Seasons all his Appoint∣ments had a Magnificence as if it were formed by the Genius of  Trimalchio  of old which showed it self in doing ordinary Things with an Air of Pomp and Grandeur  Orlando  therefore called for Tea by Beat of Drum his Valet got ready to shave him by a Trumpet to Horse and Water was brought for his Teeth when the Sound was changed to Boots and Saddle  In all these glorious Excesses from the com∣mon Practice did the happy  Orlando  live and reign in an uninterrupted Tranquility till an unlucky Accident brought to his Remem∣brance that one Evening he was married before he courted the Nuptials of  Villaria  Several fatal  Memorandums  were produced to revive the Memory of this Accident and the unhap∣py Lover was for ever banished her Presence to whom he owed the Support of his just Re∣nown and Gallantry But Distress does not debase noble Minds it only changes the Scene and gives them new Glory by that Alteration  Orlando  therefore now raves in a Garret and calls to his NeighbourSkies to pity his Do∣lors  and to find Redress for an unhappy Lover All high Spirits in any great Agitation of Mind are inclined to relieve themselves by Poetry The renown'd Porter of  Oliver  had not more Volumes around his Cell in the College of  Bed∣lam  than  Orlando  in his present Apartment And though inserting Poetry in the midst of Prose be thought a Licence among correct Writers not to be indulged it is hoped the Necessity of doing it to give a just Idea of the Hero of whom we treat will plead for the Liberty we shall hereafter take to print  Orlando  's Soliloquies in Verse and Prose after the Manner of great Wits and such as those to whom they are nearly ally'd  Will's Coffeehouse  August  A good Company of us were this Day to see or rather to hear an artful Person do several Feats of Activity with his Throat and Wind∣pipe The first Thing wherewith he present∣ed us was a Ring of Bells which he imitated in a most miraculous Manner after that he gave us all the different Notes of a Pack of Hounds to our great Delight and Asto∣nishment The Company expressed their Ap∣plause with much Noise and never was heard such an Harmony of Men and Dogs But a certain plump merry Fellow from an Angle of the Room fell a crowing like a Cock so ingeniously that he won our Hearts from the other Operator in an Instant As soon as I saw him I recollected I had seen him on the Stage and immediately knew it to be  Tom Mirrour  the Comical Actor He immediately addressed himself to me and told me he was surprized to see a Virtuoso take Satisfaction in any Representations below that of humane Life and asked me Whether I  thought this acting Bells and Dogs was to be considered under the Notion of Wit Humour or Satyr Were it not better continued he to have some particular Picture of Man laid before your Eyes that might incite your Laughter He had no sooner spoke the Word but he im∣mediately quitted his natural Shape and talked to me in a very different Air and Tone from what he had used before upon which all that sate near us laughed but I saw no Distortion in his Countenance or any Thing that appeared to me disagreeable I asked  Pacolet  What meant that sudden Whisper about us For I could not take the Jest He answered The Gentleman you were talking to assumed your Air and Countenance so exactly that all fell a laughing to see how little you knew your self and how much you were enamoured with your own Image But that Person continu∣ed my Monitor if Men would make the right Use of him might be as Instrumental to their reforming Errors in Gesture Language and Speech as a DancingMaster Linguist or O∣rator You see he laid your self before you with so much Address that you saw nothing particular in his Behaviour He has so happy a Knack of representing Errors and Imperfections that you can bear your Faults in him as well as in your self He is the first Mimick that ever gave the Beauties as well as the Deformities of the Man he acted What Mr  Dryden  said of a very great Man may be well applied to him  He is  Not one but all Mankind's Epitome  You are to know that this  Pantomime  may be said to be a Species of himself He has no Commerce with the rest of Mankind but as they are the Objects of Imitation like the  Indian  Fowl called the  MockBird  who has no Note of his own but hits every Sound in the Wood as soon as he hears it so that  Mirrour  is at once a Copy and an Original Poor  Mirrour  's Fate as well as Talent is like that of the Bird we just now spoke of The Nightingale the Linnet the Lark are delighted with his Company but the Buz∣zard the Crow and the Owl are observed to be his mortal Enemies Whenever  Sophro∣nius  meets  Mirrour  he receives him with Ci∣vility and Respect and well knows a good Copy of himself can be no Injury to him but  Bathillus  shuns the Secret where he ex∣pects to meet him for he that knows his every Step and Look is constrained and affect∣ed must be afraid to be rival'd in his Action and of having it discovered to be unnatural by its being practised by another as well as himself  From my own Apartment  August  Letters from  Coventry  and other Places have been sent to me in Answer to what I have said in Relation to my Antagonist Mr  Powell  and advise me with warm Language to keep to Subjects more proper for me than such high Points But the Writers of these Epi∣stles mistake the Use and Service I propose to the learned World by such Observations For you are to understand That the Title of this Paper gives me a Right in taking to my self and inserting in it all such Parts of any Book or Letter which are foreign to the Purpose intended or professed by the Writer  So that suppose Two great Divines should ar∣gue and treat each other with Warmth and Le∣vity unbecoming their Subject or Character all that they say unfit for that Place is very proper to be inserted here Therefore from Time to Time in all Writings which shall here∣after be published you shall have from me Extracts of all that shall appear not to the Purpose and for the Benefit of the gentle Reader I will show what to turn over un∣read and what to peruse For this End I have a Mathematical Sive preparing in which I will sift every Page and Paragraph and all that falls through I shall make bold with for my own Use The same Thing will be as beneficial in Speech for all superfluous Ex∣pressions in Talk fall to me also As when a Pleader at the Bar designs to be extremely impertinent and troublesome and cries  Un∣der Favour of the CourtWith Submission my LordI humbly offer  and  I think I have well considered this Matter for I would be very far from trifling with your Lordship's Time or trespassing upon your PatienceHow∣ever thus I will venture to say  and so forth Or else when a sufficient selfconceited Coxcomb is bringing out something in his own Praise and begins  Without Vanity  I must take this upon me to assert There is also a Trick which the Fair Sex have that will great∣ly contribute to swelling my Volumes As when a Woman is going to abuse her best Friend  Pray  said she  have you heard what I said of Mrs such a one I am hear∣tily sorry to hear any Thing of that Kind of one I have so great a Value for but they make no Scruple of telling it and it was not spoken of to me as a Secret for now all the Town  ings of it  All such Flowers in Rhetorick  and little Refuges for Malice are to be noted and naturally belong only to Tatlers By this Me∣thod you will immediately find Volumes contract themselves into Octavo's and the Labour of a Fortnight got over in half a Day  St James's Coffeehouse  August  Last Night arrived a Mail from  Lisbon  which gives a very pleasing Account of the Posture of Affairs in that Part of the World the Enemy having been necessitated wholly to abandon the Blockade of  Olivenza  These Advices say That Sir  John Jennings  is arrived at  Lisbon  When that Gentleman left  Barcelona  his Catholick Ma∣jesty was making all possible Methods for carry∣ing on an Offensive War It is observed with great Satisfaction in the Court of  Spain  That there is a very good Intelligence between the Ge∣neral Officers Count  Staremberg  and Mr  Stan∣hope  acting in all Things with such Unanimity that the Publick Affairs receive great Advan∣tages from their personal Friendship and Esteem to each other and mutual Assistance in promoting the Service of the Common Cause  This is to give Notice That if any ablebodied  Palatine  will enter into the Bonds of Matrimony with  Betty Pepin  the said  Palatine  shall be settled in a Freehold of  s per Annum  in the County of  Middlesex  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturday Aug  to  Tuesd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  Delamira  resigns her Fan  LOng had the Crowd of the Gay and Young stood in Suspence as to their Fate in their Passion to the beauteous  Delamira  but all their Hopes are lately vanished by the Declaration that she has made of her Choice to take the happy  Archibald  for her Companion for Life Upon her making this known the Expence of Sweet Powder and Jessamine are considerably a∣bated and the Mercers and Milleners complain of her Want of publick Spirit in not concealing longer a Secret which was so much the Benefit of Trade But so it has happened and no one was in Confidence with her in carrying on this Treaty but the matchless  Virgulta  whose De∣spair of ever entring the Matrimonial State made her some Nights before  Delamira  's Resolution was publish'd to the World address her self to her in the following Manner  Delamira  You are now going into that State of Life wherein the Use of your Charms is wholly to be applied to the pleasing only one Man That swimming Air of your Body that janty bearing of your Head over one Shoulder and that inex∣pressible Beauty in your Manner of playing your Fan must be lower'd into a more confin'd Behavi∣our to show That you would rather shun than receive Addresses for the future Therefore dear  Delamira  give me those Excellencies you leave off  and acquaint me with your Manner of Charming For I take the Liberty of your Friendship to say That when I consider my own Stature Motion Com∣plexion Wit or Breeding I cannot think my self any Way your Inferior yet do I go through Crowds without wounding a Man and all my Acquaintance marry round me while I live a Virgin unask'd and I think unregarded  Delamira  heard her with great Attention and with that Dexterity which is natural to her told her That all she had above the rest of her Sex and contemporary Beauties was wholly ow∣ing to a Fan which was left her by her Mother and had been long in the Family which who∣ever had in Possession and used with Skill should command the Hearts of all her Behold∣ers And since said she smiling I have no more to do with extending my Conquests or Tri∣umphs I'll make you a Present of this inestima∣ble Rarity  Virgulta  made her Expressions of the highest Gratitude for so uncommon a Confidence in her and desired she would show her what was peculiar in the Management of that Utensil which render'd it of such general Force while she was Mistress of it  Delamira  reply'd You see Madam  Cupid  is the principal Figure painted on it and the Skill in play∣ing this Fan is in your several Motions of it to let him appear as little as possible for ho∣nourable Lovers fly all Endeavours to ensnare 'em and your  Cupid  must hide his Bow and Arrow or he'll never be sure of his Game You may observe continued she That in all publick Assemblies the Sexes seem to separate them∣selves and draw up to attack each other with Eyeshot That is the Time when the Fan which is all the Armour of Woman is of most Use in our Defence for our Minds are constru∣ed  by the waving of that little Instrument and our Thoughts appear in Composure or Agitation according to the Motion of it You may observe when  Will Peregrine  comes into the Side Box Miss  Gatty  flutters her Fan as a Fly does its Wings round a Candle while her elder Sister who is as much in Love with him as she is is as grave as a Vestal at his Entrance and the Conse∣quence is accordingly He watches half the Play for a Glance from her Sister while  Gatty  is over∣looked and neglected I wish you heartily as much Success in the Management of it as I have had If you think fit to go on where I left off I will give you a short Account of the Execution I have made with it  Cimon  who is the dullest of Mortals and tho' a wonderful great Scholar does not only pause but seems to take a Nap with his Eyes open be∣tween every other Sentence in his Discourse Him have I made a Leader in Assemblies and one Blow on the Shoulder as I passed by him has raised him to a downright Impertinent in all Conversations The airy  Will Sampler  is become a Lethargick by this my Wand as  Ci∣mon  is sprightly Take it good Girl and use it without Mercy for the Reign of Beauty never lasted full Three Years but it ended in Mar∣riage or Condemnation to Virginity As you fear therefore the one and hope for the other I expect an Hourly Journal of your Triumphs for I have it by certain Tradition that it was given to the first who wore it by an Inchantress with this remarkable Power That it bestows a Husband in half a Year to her who does not overlook her proper Minute but assigns to a long Despair the Woman who is well offered and neglects that Proposal May Occasion at∣tend your Charms and your Charms slip no Occasion Give me I say an Account of the  Progress of your Forces at our next Meeting and you shall hear what I think of my new Con∣dition I should meet my future Spouse this Mo∣ment Farewel Live in just Terror of the dread∣ful Words SHE WAS  From my own Apartment  August  I had the Honour this Evening to visit some Ladies where the Subject of the Conversation was  Modesty  which they commended as a Qua∣lity quite as becoming in Men as in Women I took the Liberty to say It might be as beauti∣ful in our Behaviour as in theirs yet it could nee be said it was as successful in Life for as it was the only Recommendation in them so it was the greatest Obstacle to us both in Love and Business A Gentleman present was of my Mind and said That we must describe the Difference between the Modesty of Women and that of Men or we should be confounded in our Reasonings upon it for this Virtue is to be regarded with Regard to our different Ways of Life The Woman's Province is to be careful in her Oeconomy and chast in her Affection The Man's to be active in the Improvement of his Fortune and ready to undertake whatever is consistent with his Reputation for that End Modesty therefore in a Woman has a certain a∣greeable Fear in all she enters upon and in Men it is composed of a right Judgment of what is proper for them to attempt From hence it is that a discreet Man is always a mo∣dest one It is to be noted That Modesty in a Man is never to be allowed as a good Quality but a Weakness if it suppresses his Virtue and hides it from the World when he has at the same Time a Mind to exert himself A  French  Author says very justly That Modesty is to the other Virtues in a Man what Shade in a Picture is to the Parts of the Thing represented It  makes all the Beauties conspicuous which would otherwise be but a wild Heap of Colours This Shade on our Actions must therefore be very just∣ly applied for if there be too much it hides our good Qualities instead of showing them to Ad∣vantage  Nestor  in  Athens  was an unhappy Instance of this Truth for he was not only in his Profession the greatest Man of that Age but had given more Proofs of it than any other Man ever did yet for Want of that natural Freedom and Audacity which is necessary in Commerce with Men his personal Modesty overthrew all his publick A∣ctions  Nestor  was in those Days a skilful Ar∣chitect and in a Manner the Inventor of the Use of Mechanick Powers which he brought to so great Perfection that he knew to an Atom what Foundation would bear such a Superstructure And they record of him That he was so prodi∣giously exact that for the Experimentsake he built an Edifice of great Beauty and seeming Strength but contrived so as to bear only its own Weight and not to admit the Addition of the least Particle This Building was beheld with much Admiration by all the Virtuosi of that Time but fell down with no other Pressure but the settling of a  Wren  upon the Top of it Yet  Nestor  's Modesty was such that his Art and Skill were soon disregarded for Want of that Manner with which Men of the World support and as∣sert the Merit of their own Performances Soon after this Instance of his Art  Athens  was by the Treachery of its Enemies burnt to the Ground This gave  Nestor  the greatest Occasion that ever Builder had to render his Name im∣mortal and his Person venerable For all the new City rose according to his Disposition and all the Monuments of the Glories and Distresses of that People were erected by that sole Artist  Nay all their Temples as well as Houses were the Effects of his Study and Labour insomuch that it was said by an old Sage Sure  Nestor  will now be famous for the Habitations of Gods as well as Men are built by his Contrivance But this bashful Quality still put a Damp upon his great Knowledge which has as fatal an Effect upon Men's Reputations as Poverty for as it was said The poor Man saved the City and the poor Man's Labour was forgot so here we find The modest Man built the City and the modest Man's Skill was unknown  Thus we see every Man is the Maker of his own Fortune and what is very odd to consider he must in some Measure be the Trumpet of his Fame Not that Men are to be tolerated who directly praise themselves but they are to be endued with a Sort of defensive Eloquence by which they shall be always capable of expressing the Rules and Arts by which they govern them∣selves  Varillus  was the Man of all I have read of the happiest in the true Possession of this Quality of Modesty My Author says of him Modesty in  Varillus  is really a Virtue for it is a voluntary Quality and the Effect of good Sense He is naturally bold and enterprising but so justly discreet that he never acts or speaks any Thing but those who behold him know he has for∣born much more than he has performed or utter'd out of Deference to the Persons before whom he is This makes  Varillus  truly amiable and all his Attempts successful for as bad as the World is thought to be by those who are perhaps uaskill'd in it Want of Success in our Actions is generally owing to Want of Judgment in what we ought to attempt or a rustick Mo∣desty which will not give us Leave to under∣take  what we ought But how unfortunate this diffident Temper is to those who are possessed with it may be best seen in the Success of such as are wholly unacquainted with it  We have one peculiar Elegance in our Lan∣guage above all others which is conspicuous in the Term  Fellow  This Word added to any of our Adjectives extremely varies or quite alters the Sense of that with which it is joined Thus though a modest Man is the most unfortunate of all Men yet a modest Fellow is as superlatively happy A modest Fellow is a ready Creature who with great Humility and as great Forward∣ness visits his Patrons at all Hours and meets 'em in all Places and has so moderate an Opi∣nion of himself that he makes his Court at large If you won't give him a great Employment he will be glad of a little one He has so great a Deference for his Benefactor's Judgment that as he thinks himself fit for any Thing he can get so he is above nothing which is offered He is like the young Batchelor of Arts who came to Town recommended to a Chaplain's Place but none being vacant modestly accepted of that of a Postillion  We have very many conspicuous Persons of this undertaking yet modest Turn I have a Grandson who is very happy in this Quality I sent him in the Time of the last Peace into  France  As soon as he landed at  Calais  he sent me an exact Account of the Nature of the People and the Policies of the King of  France  I got him since chosen a Member of a Corporation The modest Creature as soon as he came into the Common Council told a Senior Burgess he was perfectly out in the Orders of their House In other Circumstances he is so thoroughly modest a Fellow that he seems to pretend only to Things he understands He is a Citizen only at  Court and in the City a Courtier In a Word to speak the Characteristical Difference between a Modest Man and a Modest Fellow the modest Man is in Doubt in all his Actions a modest Fellow never has a Doubt from his Cradle to his Grave  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Aug  to  Thursday Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  The Civil Husband  THE Fate and Character of the inconstant  Osmyn  is a just Excuse for the little No∣tice taken by his Widow of his Departure out of this Life which was equally troublesome to  Elmira  his faithful Spouse and to himself That Life passed between 'em after this Manner is the Reason the Town has just now received a Lady with all that Gaiety after having been a Relict but Three Months which other Women hardly assume under Fifteen after such a Disa∣ster  Elmira  is the Daughter of a rich and worthy Citizen who gave her to  Osmyn  with a Portion which might have obtained her an Al∣liance with our noblest Houses and fixed her in the Eye of the World where her Story had not been now to be related For her good Qualities had made her the Object of universal Esteem among the polite Part of Mankind from whom she has been banish'd and immur'd till the Death of her Gaoler It is now full Fifteen Years since that beauteous Lady was given into the Hands of the happy  Osmyn  who in the Sense of all the World received at that Time a  Present more valuable than the Possession of both the  Indies  She was then in her early Bloom with an Understanding and Discretion very little inferior to the most experienced Matrons She was not beholden to the Charms of her Sex that her Company was preferable to any  Osmyn  could meet with abroad for were all she said considered without Regard to her being a Wo∣man it might stand the Examination of the se∣verest Judges She had all the Beauty of her own Sex with all the ConversationAccomplishments of ours  But  Osmyn  very soon grew surfeited with the Charms of her Person by Possession and of her Mind by Want of Taste for he was one of that loose Sort of Men who have but one Reason for setting any Value upon the fair Sex who consider even Brides but as new Women and consequent∣ly neglect 'em when they cease to be such All the Merit of  Elmira  could not prevent her be∣coming a meer Wife within few Months after her Nuptials and  Osmyn  had so little Relish for her Conversation that he complained of the Advantages of it My Spouse said he to one of his Companions is so very discreet so good so virtuous and I know not what that I think her Person is rather the Object of Esteem than of Love and there is such a Thing as a Merit which causes rather Distance than Passion But there being no  Medium  in the State of Matrimo∣ny their Life began to take the usual Gradations to become the most irksome of all Beings They grew in the first Place very complaisant and having at Heart a certain Knowledge that they were indifferent to each other Apologies were made for every little Circumstance which they thought betray'd their mutual Coldness This lasted but few Months when they showed a Difference of Opinion in every Trifle and  as a Sign of certain Decay of Affection the Word  Perhaps  was introduced in all their Dis∣course  I have a Mind to go to the Park  says she  but  perhaps  my Dear you will want the Coach on some other Occasion He would very wil∣lingly carry her to the Play but  perhaps  she had rather go to Lady  Centaure  's and play at  Ombre They were both Persons of good Discerning and soon found that they mortally hated each other by their Manner of hiding it Certain it is that there are some Genio's which are not capa∣ble of pure Affection and a Man is born with Talents for it as much as for Poetry or any other Science  Osmyn  began too late to find the Imperfection of his own Heart and used all the Methods in the World to correct it and argue himself into Return of Desire and Passion for his Wife by the Contemplation of her excellent Qualities his great Obligations to her and the high Value he saw all the World except himself did put upon her But such is Man's unhappy Condition that tho' the Weakness of the Heart has a prevailing Power over the Strength of the Head yet the Strength of the Head has but small Force against the Weakness of the Heart  Osmyn  therefore struggled in vain to revive departed Desire and for that Reason resolved to retire to one of his Estates in the Country and pass away his Hours of Wedlock in the noble Diversions of the Field and in the Fury of a disappointed Lover made an Oath to leave neither Stag Fox or Hare li∣ving during the Days of his Wife Besides that Country Sports would be an Amusement he ho∣ped also that his Spouse would be half killed by the very Sense of seeing this Town no more and would think her Life ended as soon as she left it He communicated his Design to  Elmira  who re∣ceived it as now she did all Things like a Per∣son  too unhappy to be relieved or afflicted by the Circumstance of Place This unexpected Resig∣nation made  Osmyn  resolve to be as obliging to her as possible and if he could not prevail upon himself to be kind he took a Resolution at least to act sincerely and communicate frankly to her the Weakness of his Temper to excuse the Indifference of his Behaviour He disposed his Houshold in the Way to  Rutland  so as he and his Lady travelled only in the Coach for the Con∣venience of Discourse They had not gone many Miles out of Town when  Osmyn  spoke to this Purpose  My Dear  I believe I look quite as silly now I am going to tell you I do not love you as when I first told you I did We are now going into the Country together with only one Hope for making this Life agreeable Survivorship Desire is not in our Power mine is all gone for you What shall we do to carry it with Decency to the World and hate one another with Discretien  The Lady answered without the least Observa∣tion on the Extravagance of his Speech  My Dear  You have lived most of your Days in a Court and I have not been wholly unacquainted with that Sort of Life In Courts you see Good∣will is spoken with great Warmth Illwill covered with great Civility Men are long in Civilities to those they hate and short in Expressions of Kind∣ness to those they love Therefore my Dear let us be wellbred still and it is no matter as to all who see us whether we love or hate And to let you see how much you are beholden to me for my Conduct I have both hated and despised you my Dear this half Year and yet neither in Lan∣guage or Behaviour has it been visible but that I  loved you tenderly Therefore as I know you go out of Town to divert Life in Pursuit of Beasts and Conversation with Men just above 'em so my Life from this Moment I shall read all the learned Cooks who have ever writ study Broths Plaisters and Conserves till from a Fine Lady I become a Notable Woman We must take our Minds a Note or two lower or we shall be tortur'd by Jealousy or Anger Thus I am resolved to kill all keen Passions by employing my Mind on little Subjects and lessening the Easiness of my Spirit while you my Dear with much Ale Exercise and ill Company are so good as to endeavour to be as contemptible as it is necessary for my Quiet I should think you  To  Rutland  they arrived and lived with great but secret Impatience for many successive Years till  Osmrn  thought of an happy Expedient to give their Affairs a new Turn One Day he took  El∣mira  aside and spoke as follows  My Dear  You see here the Air is so temperate and serene the Rivulets the Groves and Soil so extremely kind to Nature that we are stronger and firmer in our Health since we left the Towns so that there is no Hope of a Release in this Place But if you will be so kind as to go with me to my Estate in the Hundreds of  Essex  it is possible some kind Damp may one Day or other re∣lieve us If you will condescend to accept of this Offer I will add that whole Estate to your Jointure in this County  Elmira  who was all Goodness accepted the Offer removed accordingly and has left her Spouse in that Place to rest with his Fathers  This is the real Figure in which  Elmira  ought to be beheld in this Town and not thought guilty of an Indecorum in not professing the Sense or bearing the Habit of Sorrow for one who robbed her of all the Endearments of Life and gave her only common Civility instead of Complacency of Manners Dignity of Passion and that constant Assemblage of soft Desires and Affections which all feel who love but none can express  Will's Coffeehouse  August  Mr  Truman  who is a mighty Admirer of Dramatick Poetry and knows I am about a Tragedy never meets me but he is giving Ad∣monitions and Hints for my Conduct Mr  Bick∣erstaff  said he I was reading last Night your second Act you were so kind to lend me but I find you depend mightily upon the Retinue of your Hero to make him magnificent You make Guards and Ushers and Courtiers and Commons and Nobles march before and then enters your Prince and says they can't defend him from his Love Why prithee  Isaac  who ever thought they could Place me your loving Monarch in a Solitude let him have no Sense at all of his Grandeur but let it be eaten up with his Passion He must value himself as the greatest of Lovers not as the first of Princes And then let him say a more tender Thing than ever Man said beforeFor his Feather and Eagle's Beak are nothing at all The Man is to be expressed by his Sentiments and Af∣fections and not by his Fortune or Equipage You are also to take Care that at his first En∣trance he says something which may give us an Idea of what we are to expect in a Person of his Way of Thinking  Shakespear  is your Pat∣tern  In the Tragedy of  Caesar  he introduces his Hero in his NightGown He had at that Time all the Power of  Rome  Deposed Consuls Subordinate Generals and Captive Princes might have preceded him but his Genius was above such Mechanick Methods of showing Greatness Therefore he rather presents that great Soul de∣bating upon the Subject of Life and Death with his intimate Friends without endeavouring to prepossess his Audience with empty Show and Pomp When those who attend him talk of the many Omens which had appeared that Day he answers  Cowards die many Times before their Deaths  The Valiant never taste of Death but once  Of all the Wonders that I yet have heard  It seems to me most strange that Men should fear  Seeing that Death a necessary End  Will come when it will come  When the Hero has spoken this Sentiment there is nothing that is great which cannot be expected from one whose first Position is the Contempt of Death to so high a Degree as ma∣king his  Exit  a Thing wholly indifferent and not a Part of his Care but that of Heaven and Fate  St James's Coffeehouse  August  Letters from  Brussels  of the th Instant  N S  say That MajorGeneral  Ravignan  returned on the th with the  French  King's Answer to the intended Capitulation for the Citadel of  Tour∣nay  which is That he does not think fit to sign that Capitulation except the Allies will grant a Cessation of Arms in general during the Time in which all Acts of Hostility were to have ceased between the Citadel and the Be∣siegers Soon after the Receipt of this News  the Cannon on each Side began to play There are Two Attacks against the Citadel commanded by General  Lottum  and General  Schuylemberg  which are both carried on with great Success and it is not doubted but the Citadel will be in the Hands of the Allies before the last Day of this Month Letters from  Ipres  say That on the th Instant Part of the Garrison of that Place had mutined in Two Bodies each consisting of Two Hundred who being dispersed the same Day a Body of Eight Hundred appeared in the MarketPlace at Nine the Night following and seized all Manner of Provisions but were with much Dif∣ficulty quieted The Governour has not punish∣ed any of the Offenders the Dissatisfaction being universal in that Place and it is thought the Officers foment those Disorders that the Ministry may be convinced of the Necessity of paying those Troops and supplying them with Provi∣sions These Advices add That on the th the Marquis  d'Este  passed Express through  Brussels  from the Duke of  Savoy  with Advice That the Army of his Royal Highness had forced the Re∣trenchments of the Enemy in  Savoy  and defeated that Body of Men which guarded those Passes un∣der the Command of the Marquis  de Thouy  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Aug  to  Saturd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  Of the Government of Affection  WHEN Labour was pronounced to be the Portion of Man that Doom reach∣ed the Affections of his Mind as well as his Person the Matter on which he was to feed and all the animal and vegetable World about him There is therefore an assiduous Care and Cultivation to be bestowed upon our Passions and Affections for they as they are the Ex∣crescencies of our Souls like our Hair and Beards look horrid or becoming as we cut or let 'em grow All this grave Preface is meant to assign a Reason in Nature for the unaccoun∣table Behaviour of  Duumvir  the Husband and Keeper Ten Thousand Follies had this unhap∣py Man escaped had he made a Compact with himself to be upon his Guard and not permit∣ted his vagrant Eye to let in so many different Inclinations upon him as all his Days he has been perplexed with But indeed at present he has brought himself to be confined only to one prevailing Mistress between whom and his Wife  Duumvir  passes his Hours in all the Vi∣cissitudes which attend Passion and Affection without the Intervention of Reason  Laura  his Wife and  Phillis  his Mistress are all with whom he has had for some Months the least amorous Commerce  Duumvir  has passed the Noon of Life but cannot withdraw from those Enter∣tainments  which are pardonable only before that Stage of our Being and which after that Season are rather Punishments than Satisfactions For pall'd Appetite is humorous and must be grati∣fied with Sauces rather than Food For which End  Duumvir  is provided with an haughty imperious expensive and fantastick Mistress to whom he retires from the Conversation of an affable humble discrect and affectionate Wife  Laura  receives him after Absence with an easie and unaffected Complacency but that he calls insipid  Phillis  rates him for his Absence and bids him return from whence he came This he calls Spirit and Fire  Laura  's Gentleness is thought mean  Phillis  's Insolence sprightly Were you to see him at his own Home and his Mistress's Lodgings to  Phillis  he appears an ob∣sequious Lover to  Laura  an imperious Ma∣ster Nay so unjust is the Taste of  Duumvir  that he owns  Laura  has no ill Quality but that she is his Wife  Phillis  no good one but that she is his Mistress And he has himself often said were he married to any one else he would rather keep  Laura  than any Woman li∣ving yet allows at the same Time that  Phillis  were she a Woman of Honour would have been the most insipid Animal breathing The other Day  Laura  who has a Voice like an An∣gel began to sing to him Fie Madam he cry'd we must be past all these Gaieties  Phillis  has a Note as rude and as loud as that of a MilkMaid When she begins to warble Well says he There is such a pleasing Simplicity in all that Wench doesIn a Word the affectionate Part of his Heart being corrupted and his true Taste that Way wholly lost he has contracted a Prejudice to all the Behaviour of  Laura  and a general Partiality in Favour of  Phillis  It is not in the Power of the Wife to  do a pleasing Thing nor in the Mistress to com∣mit one that is disagreeable There is some∣thing too melancholy in the Reflection on this Circumstance to be the Subject of Raillery He said a sour Thing to  Laura  at Dinner the other Day upon which she burst into Tears What the Devil Madam says he can't I speak in my own House He answer'd  Phillis  a little abrupt∣ly at Supper the same Evening upon which she threw his Periwig into the Fire Well said he thou art a brave Termagant Jade Do you know Hussey that fair Wig cost Forty Guinea's Oh  Laura  Is it for this that the faithful  Chromius  sigh'd for you in vain How is thy Condition alter'd since Crowds of Youth hung on thy Eye and watch'd its Glances It is not many Months since  Laura  was the Won∣der and Pride of her own Sex as well as the Desire and Passion of ours At Plays and at Balls the just Turn of her Behaviour the De∣cency of her Virgin Charms chastis'd yet ad∣ded to Diversions At Publick Devotions her winning Modesty her resign'd Carriage made Virtue and Religion appear with new Orna∣ments and in the natural Apparel of Simplicity and Beauty In ordinary Conversations a sweet Conformity of Manners and an Humility which heighten'd all the Complacencies of good Breed∣ing and Education gave her more Slaves than all the Pride of her Sex ever made Woman wish for  Laura  's Hours are now spent in the sad Reflection on her Choice and that deceit∣ful Vanity almost inseparable from the Sex  f believing she could reclaim one that had so  ften ensnared others as it now is it is not  ven in the Power of  Duumvir  himself to do her  ustice For though Beauty and Merit are Things  eal and independent on Taste and Opinion  et Agreeableness is arbitrary and the Mistress  has much the Advantage of the Wife But when∣ever Fate is so kind to her and her Spouse as to end her Days with all this Passion for  Phillis  and Indifference for  Laura  he has a Second Wife in View who may avenge the Injuries done to her Predecessor  Aglaura  is the destin'd Lady who has liv'd in Assemblies has Ambition and Play for her Entertainment and thinks of a Man not as the Object of Love but the Tool of her Interest or Pride If ever  Aglaura  comes to the Empire of this Inconstant she will endear the Memory of her Predecessor But in the mean Time it is melancholy to consider That the Vir∣tue of a Wife is like the Merit of a Poet never justly valued till after Death  From my own Apartment  August  As we have professed that all the Actions of Men are our Subject the most solemn are not to be omitted if there happen to creep into their Behaviour any Thing improper for such Occa∣sions Therefore the Offence mentioned in the following Epistles tho' it may seem to be com∣mitted in a Place sacred from Observation is such that it is our Duty to remark upon it for though he who does it is himself only guilty of an Inde∣corum he occasions a Criminal Levity in all o∣thers who are present at it  Mr  Bickerstaff  IT being mine as well as the Opinion of many others that your Papers are extremely well fit∣ted to reform any irregular or indecent Practice I present the following as one which requires your Cor∣rection My self and a great many good People who frequent the Divine Service at St  Paul  's have been a long Time scandaliz'd by the imprudent Conduct of  Stentor  in that Cathedral This Gentleman you must know is always very exact and zealous in his Devotion which I believe no Body blames  but then he is accustom'd to roar and bellow so terri∣bly loud in the  Responses  that he frightens even us of the Congregation who are daily us'd to him and one of our PettyCanons a Punning  Cambridge  Scholar calls his Way of Worship a  BullOffering  His harsh untunable Pipe is no more fit than a Ra∣ven's to join with the Musick of a Choir yet no Bo∣dy having been enough his Friend I suppose to in∣form him of it he never fails when present to drown the Harmony of every Hymn and Anthens by an Inundation of Sound beyond that of the Bridge at the Ebb of the Tide or the neighbouring Lions in the Anguish of their Hunger This is a Grievance which to my certain Knowledge several worthy People de∣sire to see redress'd and if by inserting this Epistle in your Paper or by representing the Matter your own Way you can convince  Stentor  that Discord in a Choir is the same Sin that Schism is in the Church in general you would lay a great Obligation upon us and make some Atonement for certain of your Paragraphs which have not been highly approved by us I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Jeoffry Chanticleer  St  Paul's  Church∣yard  Aug  It is wonderful there should be such a general Lamentation and the Grievance so frequent and yet the Offender never know any Thing of it I have received the following Letter from my Kins∣man at the  HeraldsOffice  near the same Place  Dear Cousin  THis Office which has had its Share in the im∣partial Justice of your Censures demands at pre∣sent your Vindication of their Rights and Privile∣ges There are certain Hours when our young Heralds  are exercis'd in the Faculties of making Proclama∣tion and other Vociferations which of Right belong to us only to utter But at the same Hours  Stentor  in St  Paul  's Church in Spight of the Coaches Carts  London  Cries and all other Sounds between us exalts his Throat to so high a Key that the most Noisy of our Order is utterly unheard If you please to observe upon this you will ever oblige  c  There have been communicated to me some o∣ther ill Consequences from the same Cause as the overturning of Coaches by sudden Starts of the Horses as they pass'd that Way Women pregnant frighten'd and Heirs to Families lost which are Publick Disasters though arising from a good In∣tention But it is hoped after this Admonition that  Stentor  will aviod an Act of so great Super∣crogation as singing without a Voice  But I am diverted from prosecuting  Stentor  's Reformation by an Account That the Two faith∣ful Lovers  Lisander  and  Coriana  are dead for no longer ago than the first of the last Month they swore eternal Fidelity to each other and to love till Death Ever since that Time  Lisander  has been twice a Day at the Chocolatehouse visits in every Circle is missing Four Hours in Four and twenty and will give no Account of himself These are undoubted Proofs of the Departure of a Lover and consequently  Coriana  is also dead as a Mistress I have written to  Stentor  to give this Couple Three Calls at the Church Door which they must hear if they are living within the Bills of Mortality and if they do not answer at that Time they are from that Moment added to the Number of my Defunct  The TATLER N  o    Paulo Majora canamns  From  Saturday Aug  to  Tuesd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  WHILE others are busied in Relations which concern the Interests of Princes the Peace of Nations and the Revolutions of Em∣pire I think though these are very great Sub∣jects my Theme of Discourse is sometimes to be of Matters of a yet higher Consideration The slow Steps of Providence and Nature and strange Events which are brought about in an Instant are what as they come within our View and Observation shall be given to the Publick Such Things are not accompanied with Show and Noise and therefore seldom draw the Eyes of the unattentive Part of Mankind but are very proper at once to exercise our Humanity please our Imaginations and improve our Judg∣ments It may not therefore be unuseful to re∣late many Circumstances which were observa∣ble upon a late Cure done upon a young Gentle∣man who was born blind and on the th of  June  last received his Sight at the Age of Twen∣ty Years by the Operation of an Oculist This happened no farther off than  Newington  and the Work was prepar'd for in the following Man∣ner  The Operator Mr  Grant  having observed the Eyes of his Patient and convinced his Friends and Relations among others the Reverend Mr  Caswell  Minister of the Place that it was highly probable  he should remove the Obstacle which prevented the Use of his Sight all his Acquaintance who had any Regard for the young Man or Curiosity to be present when one of full Age and Under∣standing received a new Sense assembled them∣selves on this Occasion Mr  Caswell  being a Gen∣tleman particularly curious desired the whole Company in case the Blindness should be cured to keep Silence and let the Patient make his own Observations without the Direction of any Thing he had received by his other Senses or the Advantage of discovering his Friends by their Voices Among several others the Mother Brethren Sisters and a young Gentle∣woman for whom he had a Passion were pre∣sent The Work was performed with great Skill and Dexterity When the Patient first re∣ceived the Dawn of Light there appeared such an Extacy in his Action that he seemed ready to sweon away in the Surprize of Joy and Won∣der The Surgeon stood before him with his Instruments in his Hand The young Man ob∣served him from Head to Foot after which he surveyed himself as carefully and seem'd to compare him to himself and observing both their Hands seem'd to think they were exactly alike except the Instruments which he took for Parts of his Hands When he had conti∣nued in this Amazement some Time his Mo∣ther could not longer bear the Agitations of so many Passions as throng'd upon her but fell upon his Neck crying out My Son My Son The Youth knew her Voice and could speak no more than Oh me Are you my Mother and fainted The whole Room you will easily conceive were very affectionately employed in recovering him but above all the young Gen∣tlewoman who loved him and whom he loved shreik'd in the loudest Manner That  Voice seem'd to have a sudden Effect upon him as he recover'd and he showed a double Cu∣riosity in observing her as she spoke and call'd to him till at last he broke out What has been done to me Whither am I carried Is all this about me the Thing I have heard so often of Is this the Light Is this Seeing Were you always thus happy when you said you were glad to see each other Where is  Tom  who used to lead me But I could now methinks go any where without him He offered to move but seem'd afraid of every Thing around him When they saw his Difficulty they told him till he became better acquainted with his new Being he must let the Servant still lead him The Boy was call'd for and presented to him Mr  Caswell  ask'd him What Sort of Thing he took  Tom  to be before he had seen him He answer'd He believed there was not so much of him as of himself but he fancied him the same Sort of Creature The Noise of this sudden Change made all the Neighbour∣hood throng to the Place where he was As he saw the Crowd thickening he desired Mr  Cas∣well  to tell him how many there were in all to be seen The Gentleman smiling answered him That it would be very proper for him to return to his late Condition and suffer his Eyes to be covered till they had received Strength for he might remember well enough that by Degrees he had from little and little come to the Strength he had at present in his Ability of Walking and Moving and that it was the same Thing with his Eyes which he said would lose the Power of continuing to him that won∣derful Transport he was now in except he would be contented to lay aside the Use of them till they were strong enough to bear the Light without so much Feeling as he knew he  underwent at present With much Reluctance he was prevailed upon to have his Eyes bound in which Condition they kept him in a dark Room till it was proper to let the Organ receive its Ob∣jects without further Precaution During the Time of this Darkness he bewail'd himself in the most distressed Manner and accused all his Friends complaining that some Incantation had been wrought upon him and some strange Ma∣gick used to deceive him into an Opinion that he had enjoyed what they called Sight He added That the Impressions then let in upon his Soul would certainly distract him it he were not so at that present At another Time he would strive to name the Persons he had seen among the Crowd after he was couched and would pretend to speak in perplexed Terms of his own ma∣king of what he in that short Time observed But on the th Instant it was thought fit to un∣bind his Head and the young Woman whom he loved was instructed to open his Eyes according∣ly as well to indear her self to him by such a Circumstance as to moderate his Extasies by the Perswasion of a Voice which had so much Power over him as hers ever had When this belov'd young Woman began to take off the Binding of his Eyes she talk'd to him as follows  Mr  William  I am now taking the Binding off though when I consider what I am doing I tremble with the Apprehension that though I have from my very Childhood loved you dark as you were and though you had con∣ceived so strong a Love for me yet you will find there is such a Thing as Beauty which may ensnare you into a Thousand P  sions of which you now are innocent and take you from me for ever But before I put my self to that Hazard tell me in what Manner that  Love you always professed to me entered into your Heart for its usual Admission is at the Eyes  The young Man answer'd  Dear  Lidis  If I am to lose by Sight the soft Pantings which I have always felt when I heard your Voice If I am no more to distinguish the Step of her I love when she approaches me but to change that sweet and frequent Pleasure for such an Amaze∣ment as I knew the little Time I lately saw Or if I am to have any Thing besides which may take from me the Sense I have of what appeared most pleasing to me at that Time which Apparition it seems was you Pull out these Eyes before they lead me to be ungrate∣ful to you or undo my self I wish'd for them but to see you pull them out if they are to make me forget you  Lidia  was extremely satisfied with these Assu∣rances and pleased her self with playing with his Perplexities In all his Talk to her he show∣ed but very feint Idea's of any Thing which had not been received at the Ear and closed his Pro∣testation to her by saying That if he were to see  Valentia  and  Barcelona  whom he supposed the most esteemed of all Women by the Quarrel there was about them he would never like any but  Lidia  St James's Coffeehouse  August  We have repeated Advices of the

whereupon he sent General  Lewenhaupt  a Summons to submit to his present Fortune  Lewenhaupt  immediately dispatched Three Ge∣neral Officers to that Prince to treat about a Capitulation but the  Swedes  though they con∣sisted of Men were in so great a Want of Provision and Ammunition that they were obli∣ged to surrender themselves at Discretion His Czarish Majesty dispatched an Express to Gene∣ral  Goltz  with an Account of these Particulars and also with Instructions to send out Detach∣ments of his Cavalry to prevent the King of  Swe∣den  's joining his Army in  Poland  That Prince made his Escape with a small Party by swimming over the  Boristhenes  and it was thought he de∣signed to retire into  Poland  by the Way of  Vol∣hinia  Advices from  Bern  of the th Instant say That

nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Tuesd Aug  to  Thursday Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  THere is a young Foreigner committed to my Care who puzzles me extremely in the Questions he asks about the Persons of Fi∣gure we meet in Publick Places He has but very little of our Language and therefore I am mightily at a Loss to express to him Things for which they have no Word in that Tongue to which he was born It has been often my Answer upon his asking Who such a fine Gen∣tleman is That he is what we call a  Sharper  and he wants my Explication I thought it would be very unjust to tell him he is the same the  French  call  Coquin  the  Latins Nebulo  or the  Greeks  For as Custom is the most powerful of all Laws and that the Order of Men we call  Sharpers  are received amongst us not only with Permission but Favour I thought it unjust to use them like Persons upon no Establishment Besides that it would be an unpardonable Dishonour to our Country to let h m leave us with an Opinion that our Nobi∣lity and Gentry kept Company with common Thiefs and Cheats I told him they were a Sort of tame Hussars that were allowed in our Cities like the wild Ones in our Camp who had all the Privileges belonging to us but as the same Time were not tied to our Discipline  or Laws  Aletheus  who is a Gentleman of too much Virtue for the Age he lives in would not let this Matter be thus palliated but told my Pupil That he was to understand that Di∣stinction Quality Merit and Industry were laid aside amongst us by the Incursions of these civil Hussars who had got so much Counte∣nance that the Breeding and Fashion of the Age turned their Way to the Ruin of Order and Oeconomy in all Places where they are ad∣mitted But  Sophronius  who never falls into Heat upon any Subject but applies proper Lan∣guage Temper and Skill with which the Thing in Debate is to be treated told the Youth that Gentleman had spoken nothing but what was literally true but fell upon it with too much Earnestness to give a true Idea of that Sort of People he was declaiming against or to reme∣dy the Evil which he bewail'd For the Ac∣ceptance of these Men being an Ill which hath crept into the ConversationPart of our Lives and not into our Constitution it self it must be corrected where it began and consequently is to be amended only by bringing Raillery and Derision upon the Persons who are guilty or those who converse with them For the  Sharpers  continued he at present are not as formerly under the Acceptation of Pickpock∣ets but are by Custom erected into a real and venerable Body of Men and have subdued us to so very particular a Deference to them that though they are known to be Men without Honour or Conscience no Demand is called a Debt of Honour so indisputably as theirs You may lose your Honour to them but they lay none against you As the Priesthood in Roman Catholick Countries can purchase what they please for the Church but they can alienate no∣thing from it It is from this Toleration that  Sharpers  are to be found among all Sorts of As∣semblies and Companies and every Talent a∣mongst Men is made Use of by some one or other of the Society for the Good of their Com∣mon Cause So that an unexperienced young Gentleman is as often ensnared by his Under∣standing as his Folly For who could be un∣moved to hear the eloquent  Dromio  explain the Constitution talk in the Key of  Cato  with the Severity of one of the ancient Sages and debate the greatest Question of State in a common Chocolate or Coffeehouse Who could I say hear this generous Declamator without being fired at his noble Zeal and becoming his pro∣fessed Follower if he might be admitted  Mo∣noculus  's Gravity would be no less inviting to a Beginner in Conversation and the Snare of his Eloquence would equally catch one who had never seen an old Gentleman so very wise and yet so little severe Many other Instances of ex∣traordinary Men among the Brotherhood might be produced but every Man who knows the Town can supply himself with such Exam∣ples without their being named  Will Vafer  who is skilful at finding out the ridiculous Side of a Thing and placing it in a new and proper Light though he very seldom talks thought fit to enter into this Subject He has lately lost certain loose Sums which half the Income of his Estate will bring in within seven Years Besides which he proposes to marry to set all right He was therefore indolent enough to speak of this Matter with great Impartiality  'When I look round me said this easy Gentle∣man and consider in a just Ballance us

Homer  in his excellent Heroick Poem calls them  Myrmidons  who were a Body who kept among themselves and had nothing to lose therefore never spared either  Greek  or  Trojan  when they fell in their Way upon a Party But there is a memorable Verse which gives us an Account of what broke that whole Body and made both  Greeks  and  Trojans  Masters of the Secret of their Warfare and Plunder There is nothing so pedantick as many Quotations therefore I shall inform you only that in this Battalion there were two Officers called  Thersites  and  Pandarus  they were both less renowned for their Beauty than their Wit but each had this particular Happiness that they were plunged over Head and Ears in the same Water which made  Achilles  invulnerable and had ever af∣ter certain Gifts which the rest of tke World were never to enjoy Among others they were  never to know they were the most dreadful to the Sight of all Mortals never to be diffident of their own Abilities never to blush or ever to be wounded but by each other Though some Historians say Gaming began among the  Ly∣dians  to divert Hunger I could cite many Au∣thorities to prove it had its Rise at the Siege of  Troy  and that  Ulysses  won the Sevenfold Shield at Hazard But be that as it may the Ruin of the Corps of the  Myrmidons  proceeded from a Breach between  Thersites  and  Pandarus  The First of these was Leader of a Squadron wherein the Latter was but a private Man but having all the good Qualities necessary for a Partizan he was the Favourite of his Officer But the whole History of the several Changes in the Order of Sharpers from those  Myrmidons  to our Modern Men of Address and Plunder will require that we consult some ancient Ma∣nuscripts As we make these Enquiries we shall diurnally communicate them to the Pub∣lick that the Knights of the Industry may be better understood by the good People of  England  These Sort of Men in some Ages were Syco∣phants and Flatterers only and were endued with Arts of Life to capacitate them for the Conversation of the Rich and Great but now the Bubble courts the Impostor and pretends at the utmost to be but his Equal To clear up the Reasons and Causes in such

received a Letter from  Tom Trump  to desire that I would do the Fra∣ternity of Gamesters the Justice to own that there are notorious Sharpers who are not of their Class Among others he presented me with the Picture of  Harry Coppersmith  in Little who he says is at this Day worth half a Plumb by Means much more indirect than by false Dice I must confess there appeared some Reason in what he asserted and he met me since and ac∣costed me in the following Manner  "It is won∣derful to me Mr  Bickerstaff  that you can pre∣tend to be a Man of Penetration and fall upon us Knights of the Industry as the wickedest of Mortals when there are so many who live in the constant Practice of baser Methods unob∣served You cannot though you know the Story of my self and the  North Briton  but al∣low I am an honester Man than  Will Copper∣smith  for all his great Credit among the  Lom∣bards  I get my Money by Men's Follies and he gets his by their Distresses The declining Merchant communicates his Griefs to him and he augments them by Extortion If therefore Regard is to be had to the Merit of the Persons  we injure Who is the more blameable he that oppresses an unhappy Man or he that cheats a foolish one All Mankind are indifferently lia∣ble to adverse Strokes of Fortune and he who adds to them when he might relieve them is certainly a worse Subject than he who unbur∣dens a Man whose Prosperity is unweildy to him Besides all which he that borrows of  Cop∣persmith  does it out of Necessity he that plays with me does it out of Choice'  I allowed  Trump  there are Men as bad as him∣self which is the Height of his Pretensions and must confess that  Coppersmith  is the most wicked and impudent of all Sharpers A Creature that cheats with Credit and is a Robber in the Habit of a Friend The Contemplation of this worthy Person made me reflect on the wonderful Succes∣ses I have observed Men of the meanest Capaci∣ties meet with in the World and recollected an Observation I once heard a sage Man make which was That he had observed that in some Professions the lower the Understanding the greater the Capacity I remember he instanced that of a Banker and said That the fewer Appe∣tites Passions and Idea's a Man had he was the better for his Business  There is little Sir  Tristram  without Connexion in his Speech or so much as common Sense has arrived by his own natural Parts at one of the greatest Estates amongst us But honest Sir  Tri∣stram  knows himself to be but a Repository for Cash He is just such an Utensil as his Iron Chest and may rather be said to hold Money than possess it There is nothing so pleasant as to be in the Conversation of these wealthy Pro∣ficients I had lately the Honour to drink Half a Pint with Sir  Tristram Harry Copper∣smith  and  Giles Twoshoes  These Wags give one another Credit in Discourse according to  their Purses they jest by the Pound and make Answers as they honour Bills Without Vanity I thought my self the Prettiest Fellow of the Company but I had no Manner of Power over one Muscle in their Faces though they sneer'd at every Word spoken by each other Sir  Tri∣stram  called for a Pipe of Tobacco and telling us Tobacco was a  PotHerb  bid the Drawer bring in t'other HalfPint  Twoshoes  laughed at the Knight's Wit without Moderation I took the Liberty to say it was but a Pun A Pun says  Coppersmith  You would be a better Man by  l  if you could pun like Sir  Tristram  With that they all burst out together The Queer Curs maintain'd this Style of Dialogue till we had drank our Quarts apiece by HalfPints All I could bring away with me is That  Twoshoes  is not worth Twenty Thousand Pounds for his Mirth though he was as insipid as either of the others had no more Effect up∣on the Company than if he had been a Bank∣rupt  From my own Apartment  August  I have heard it has been advised by a Diocesan to his inferior Clergy that instead of broaching Opinions of their own and uttering Doctrines which may lead themselves and Hearers into Errors they would read some of the most ce∣lebrated Sermons printed by others for the In∣struction of their Congregations In Imitation of such Preachers at Secondhand I shall tran∣scribe from  Bruyere  one of the most elegant Pie∣ces of Raillery and Satyr which I have ever read He describes the  French  as if speaking of a Peo∣ple not yet discover'd in the Air and Style of a Traveller  I have heard talk of a Country where the old Men are Gallant Polite and Civil The young Men on the contrary Stubborn Wild without either Manners or Civility They are free from Passion for Women at the Age when in other Countries they begin to feel it and prefer Beasts Victuals and ridiculous Amours before them Amongst these People he is sober who is never drunk with any Thing but Wine the too frequent Use of it has rendered it flat and insipid to them They endeavour by Brandy and other strong Liquors to quicken their Taste already extinguish'd and want nothing to compleat their Debauchees but to drink  Aqua Fortis  The Women of that Country hasten the Decay of their Beauty by their Artifices to preserve it They paint their Cheeks Eyebrows and Shoul∣ders which they lay open together with their Breasts Arms and Ears as if they were afraid to hide those Places which they think will please and never think they show enough of them The Physiognomies of the People of that Country are not all neat but confused and embarras∣sed with a Bundle of strange Hair which they prefer before their natural With this they weave something to cover their Heads which descends down half Way their Bodies hides their Features and hinders you from knowing Men by their Faces This Nation has besides this their God and their King The Grandees go every Day at a certain Hour to a Temple they call a Church At the upper End of that Temple there stands an Altar consecrated to their God where the Priest celebrates some Mysteries which they call holy sacred and tremendous The great Men make a vast Circle at the Foot of the Al∣tar standing with their Backs to the Priest and the Holy Mysteries and their Faces erected to∣wards their King who is seen on his Knees upon  a Throne and to whom they seem to direct the Desires of their Hearts and all their Devotion However in this Custom there is to be remark∣ed a Sort of Subordination for the People appear adoring their Prince and their Prince adoring God The Inhabitants of this Region call it'Tis from Forty eight Degrees of La∣titude and more than Eleven hundred Leagues by Sea from the  Iroquois  and  Hurons  Letters from  Hampstead  say There is a Cox∣comb arrived there of a Kind which is utterly new The Fellow has Courage which he takes himself to be obliged to give Proofs of every Hour he lives He is ever fighting with the Men and contradicting the Women A Lady who sent him to me superscrib'd him with this Description out of  Suckling  I am a Man of War and Might  And know thus much that I can fight  Whether I am i'th' Wrong or Right  Devoutly  No Woman under Heaven I fear  New Oaths I can exactly swear  And forty Healths my Brains will bear  Most stoutly  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Aug  to  Tuesday Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  POor  Cynthio  who does me the Honour to talk to me now and then very freely of his most secret Thoughts and tells me his most private Frailties own'd to me that tho' he is in his very Prime of Life Love had killed all his Desires and he was now as much to be trusted with a Fine Lady as if he were Eighty That one Pas∣sion for  Clarissa  has taken up said he my whole Soul and all my idle Flames are extinguish'd as you may observe ordinary Fires are often put out by the Sunshine  This was a Declaration not to be made but up∣on the highest Opinion of a Man's Sincerity yet as much a Subject of Raillery as such a Speech would be it is certain that Chastity is a nobler Quali∣ty and as much to be valued in Men as in Wo∣men The mighty  Scipio  who as  Bluffe  says in the Comedy  was a Pretty Fellow in his Time  was of this Mind and is celebrated for it by an Author of good Sense When he lived Wit and Humour and Raillery and Publick Success were at as high a Pitch at  Rome  as at present in  England  yet I believe there was no Man in those Days thought that General at all ridiculous in his Behaviour in the following Account of him  Scipio  at Four and Twenty Years of Age had obtained a great Victory and a Multitude of Prisoners of each Sex and all Conditions fell nto his Possession Among others an agree∣able Virgin in her early Bloom and Beauty He had too sensible a Spirit to see the most lovely  of all Objects without being moved with Passion Besides which there was no Obligation of Ho∣nour or Virtue to restrain his Desires towards one who was his by the Fortune of War But a noble Indignation and a sudden Sorrow which ap∣peared in her Countenance when a Conqueror cast his Eyes upon her raised his Curiosity to know her Story He was informed That she was a Lady of the highest Condition in that Country and contracted to  Indibilis  a Man of Merit and Quality The generous  Roman  soon placed himself in the Condition of that unhappy Man who was to lose so charming a Bride and though a Youth a Batchelor a Lover and a Conqueror immediately resolved to resign all the Invitations of his Passion and the Rights of his Power to restore her to her destined Hus∣band With this Purpose he commanded her Parents and Relations as well as her Husband to attend him at an appointed Time When they met and were waiting for the General my Au∣thor frames to himself the different Concern of an unhappy Father a despairing Lover and a tender Mother in the several Persons who were so related to the Captive  But for fear of inju∣ring the delicate Circumstances with an old Tran∣slation I shall proceed to tell you That  Scipio  appears to them and leads in his Prisoner into their Presence The  Romans  as noble as they were seemed to allow themselves a little too much Triumph over the Conquer'd therefore as  Scipio  approached they all threw themselves on their Knees except the Lover of the Lady But  Scipio  observing in him a manly Sullenness was the more inclined to favour him and spoke to him in these Words  It is not the Manner of the  Romans  to use all the Power they justly may We fight not to ravage Coun∣tries or break through the Ties of Humanity I am acquainted with your Worth and your Interest in this  Lady Fortune has made me your Master but I desire to be your Friend This is your Wife Take her and may the Gods bless you with her But far be it from  Scipio  to purchase a loose and momentary Pleasure at the Rate of making an honest Man un∣happy  Indibilis  's Heart was too full to make him any Answer but he threw himself at the Feet of the General and wept aloud The Captive Lady fell into the same Posture and they both remained so till the Father burst into the following Words  Oh Divine  Scipio  The Gods have given you more than humane Virtue Oh Glorious Leader Oh Won∣drous Youth Does not that obliged Virgin give you while she prays to the Gods for your Prosperity and thinks you sent down from them Raptures above all the Transports which you could have reaped from the Possession of her injur'd Person  The temperate  Sci∣pio  answered him without much Emotion and saying  Father be a Friend to  Rome retired An immense Sum was offer'd as her Ransom but he sent it to her Husband and smiling said This is a Trifle after what I have given him already but let  Indibilis  know that Chastity at my Age is a much more difficult Virtue to practise than Ge∣nerosity  I observed  Cynthio  was very much taken with my Narrative but told me this was a Vi tue that would bear but a very inconsiderable Figure in our Days However I took the Liberty to say that we ought not to lose our Idea's of Things though we had debauched our true Relish in our Practice For after we have done laughing solid Virtue will keep its Place in Men's Opinions And tho' Custom made it not so scandalous as it ought to be to ensnare innocent Women and triumph in the Falshood such Actions as we have here related must be accounted true Gallantry and rise the higher in our Esteem the farther they are removed from our Imitation  Will's Coffeehouse  August  A Man would be apt to think in this laughing Town that it were impossible a Thing so explo∣ded as speaking hard Words should be practised by any one that had ever seen good Company but as if there were a Standard in our Minds as well as Bodies you see very many just where they were Twenty Years ago and more they cannot will not arrive at Were it not thus the noble  Martius  would not be the only Man in  England  whom no Body can understand though he talks more than any Man else  Will Dactyle  the Epigrammatist  Jack Comma  the Grammarian  Nick Crossegrain  who writes A∣nagrams and my self made a pretty Company at a Corner of this Room and enter'd very peaceably upon a Subject fit enough for us which was the Examination of the Force of the Particle  For  when  Martius  join'd us He being well known to us all asked what we were upon For he had a Mind to consummate the Happiness of the Day which had been spent among the Stars of the first Mag∣nitude among the Men of Letters and there∣fore to put a Period to it as he had commenced it he should be glad to be allowed to participate of the Pleasure of our Society I told him the Subject Faith Gentlemen said  Martius  your Subject is humble and if you would give me Leave to elevate the Conversation I should hum∣bly offer that you would enlarge your Enquiries to the Word  For asmuch  For though I take it said he to be but one Word yet the Particle  Much  implying Quantity the Particle  As  Simili∣tude it will be greater and more like our selves to treat of  Forasmuch Jack Comma  is always serious and answer'd  '  Martius  I must take the Liberty to say That you have fallen into all this Error and profuse Manner of Speech by a certain Hurry in your Imagination for Want of being more exact in the Knowledge of the Parts of  Speech and it is so with all Men who have not well studied the Particle  For  You have spoken  For  without making any Inference which is the great Use of that Particle There is no Manner of Force in your Observation of Quantity and Si∣militude in the Syllables  As  and  Much  But it is ever the Fault of Men of great Wit to be in∣correct which Evil they run into by an indis∣creet Use of the Word  For  Consider all the Books of Controversy which have been written and I'll ingage you will observe that all the De∣bate lies in this Point Whether they brought in  For  in a just Manner or forced it in for their own Use rather than as understanding the Use of the Word it self There is nothing like familiar In∣stances You have heard the Story of the  Irish∣man  who reading  Money for Live Hair  took a Lodging and expected to be paid for living at that House If this Man had known  For  was in that Place of a quite different Signification from the Particle  To  he could not have fallen into the Mistake of taking  Live  for what the  Latins  call  Vivere  or rather  Habitare  '  Martius  seem'd at a Loss and admiring his pro∣found Learning wished he had been bred a Scho∣lar for he did not take the Scope of his Discourse This wise Debate of which we had much more made me reflect upon the Difference of their Ca∣pacities and wonder that there could be as it were a Diversity in Men's Genius for Nonsence that one should bluster while another crept in Absur∣dities  Martius  moves like a blind Man lifting his Legs higher than the ordinary Way of Step∣ping and  Comma  like one who is only short∣sighted picking his Way when he should be marching on Want of Learning makes  Martius  a brisk entertaining Fool and gives himself a full Scope but that which  Comma  has and calls Learning makes him diffident and curb his na∣tural Misunderstanding to the great Loss of the  Men of Raillery This Conversation confirm'd me in the Opinion that Learning usually does but improve in us what Nature endowed us with He that wants good Sense is unhappy in having it for he has thereby only more Ways of expo∣sing himself and he that has Sense knows that Learning is not Knowledge but rather the Art of using it  St James's Coffeehouse  August  We have undoubted Intelligence of the Defeat of the King of  Sweden  and that Prince who for some Years had hovered like an approaching Tempest and was looked up at by all the Na∣tions of  Europe  which seemed to expect their Fate according to the Course he should take is now in all Probability an unhappy Exile with∣out the common Necessaries of Life His Czarish Majesty treats his Prisoners with great Gallantry and Distinction Count  Rhensfeildt  has had par∣ticular Marks of his Majesty's Esteem for his Merit and Services to his Master but Count

From  Tuesd Aug  to  Thursd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  AESOP  has gain'd to himself an immortal Re∣nown for figuring the Manners Desires Passions and Interests of Men by Fables of Beasts and Birds I shall in my future Accounts of our modern Heroes and Wits vulgarly called  Sharpers  imitate the Method of that delightful Moralist and think I cannot represent those Worthies more naturally than under the Sha∣dow of a Pack of Dogs for this Set of Men are like them made up of Finders Lurchers and Setters Some search for the Prey others pursue others take it and if it be worth it they all come in at the Death and worry the Carcass It would require a most exact Knowledge of the Field and the Harbours where the Deer lie to recount all the Revolutions in the Chase  But I am diverted from the Train of my Discourse of the Fraternity about this Town by Letters from  Hampstead  which give me an Account there is a late Institution there under the Name of a  Raf∣flingShop  which is it seems secretly supported by a Person who is a deep Practitioner in the Law and out of Tenderness of Conscience has under the Name of his Maid  Sisly  set up this easier Way of Conveyancing and Alienating Estates from one Family to another He is so far from having an Intelligence with the rest of the Fraternity that all the humbler Cheats who appear there are faced by the Partners in the  Bank and driven off by the Reflection of supe∣rior Brass This Notice is given to all the silly Faces that pass that Way that they may not be decoyed in by the soft Allurement of a Fine Lady who is the Sign to the Pageantry And at the same Time Signior  Hawksly  who is the Patron of the Houshold is desired to leave off this in∣terloping Trade or admit as he ought to do the Knights of the Industry to their Share in the Spoil But this little Matter is only by Way of Digression Therefore to return to our Worthies  The present Race of Terriers and Hounds would starve were it not for the enchanted  Actaeon  who has kept the whole Pack for many Succes∣sions of Hunting Seasons  Actaeon  has long Tracts of rich Soil but had the Misfortune in his Youth to fall under the Power of Sorcery and has been ever since some Parts of the Year a Deer and in some Parts a Man While he is a Man such is the Force of Magick he no sooner grows to such a Bulk and Fatness but he is again turned into a Deer and hunted till he is lean upon which he returns to his humane Shape Many Arts have been tried and many Resolutions taken by  Actaeon  himself to follow such Methods as would break the Inchantment but all have hitherto proved ineffectual I have therefore by Midnight Watchings and much Care found out that there is no Way to save him from the Jaws of his Hounds but to destroy the Pack which by Astrological Praescience I find I am destin'd to perform For which End I have sent out my Familiar to bring me a List of all the Places where they are harboured that I may know where to sound my Horn and bring them toge∣ther and take an Account of their Haunts and their Marks against another Opportunity  Will's Coffeehouse  August  The Author of the ensuing Letter by his Name and the Quotations he makes from the Ancients seems a Sort of Spy from the old World whom we Moderns ought to be careful of offending therefore I must be free and own it a fair Hit where he takes me rather than dis∣oblige him  SIR  HAving a peculiar Humour of desiring to be somewhat the better or wiser for what I read I am always uneasy when in any pro∣found Writer for I read no others I happen to meet with what I cannot understand When this falls out 'tis a great Grievance to me that I am not able to consult the Author himself a∣bout his Meaning for Commentators are a Sect that has little Share in my Esteem your elaborate Writings have among many others this Advantage that their Author is still alive and ready as his extensive Charity makes us expect to explain whatever may be found in in them too sublime for vulgar Understandings This Sir makes me presume to ask you How the  Hampstead  Hero's Character could be per∣fectly new when the last Letters came away and yet Sir  John Suckling  so well acquainted with it Sixty Years ago I hope Sir you will not take this amiss I can assure you I have a profound Resp ct for you which makes me write this with the same Disposition with which  Longinus  bids us read  Homer  and  Plato When in reading  says he  any of those celebrated Authors we meet with a Passage to which we cannot well reconcile our Reasons we ought firmly to believe that were those great Wits present to answer for themselves we should to our Wonder be convinced that we only are guilty of the Mi∣stakes  we before attributed to them  If you think fit to remove the Scruple that now torments me 'twill be an Encouragement to me to set∣tle a frequent Correspondence with you seve∣ral Things falling in my Way which would not perhaps be altogether foreign to your Purpose and whereon your Thoughts would be very ac∣ceptable to  Your most humble Servant  Obadiah Greenhat  I own this is clean and Mr  Greenhat  has con∣vinced me that I have writ Nonsence yet am I not at all offended at him  Scimus hanc Veniam petimus{que} damus{que} vicissim  This is the true Art of Raillery when a Man turns another into Ridicule and shows at the same Time he is in good Humour and not urg'd on by Malice against the Person he rallies  Obadiah Greenhat  has hit this very well For to make an Apology to  Isaac Bickerstaff  an unknown Student and Horary Historian as well as Astrologer and with a grave Face to say He speaks of him by the same Rules with which he would treat  Homer  or  Plato  is to place him in Company where he can∣not expect to make a Figure and makes him flatter himself that it is only being named with them which renders him most ridiculous  I have not known and I am now past my Grand Climacterick being Years of Age ac∣cording to my Way of Life or rather if you will allow Punning in an old Gentleman accor∣ding to my Way of Pastime I say as old as I am I have not been acquainted with many of the  Greenhats  There is indeed one  Zedekiah Green∣hat  who is lucky also in his Way He has a very agreeable Manner for when he has a Mind  throughly to correct a Man he never takes from him any Thing but he allows him something for it or else he blames him for Things wherein he is not defective as well as for Matters wherein he is This makes a weak Man believe he is in Jest in the whole T'other Day he told Beau  Prim  who is thought impotent that his Mistress had declared she would not have him because he was a Sloven and had committed a Rape The Beau bit at the Banter and said very gravely He thought to be clean was as much as was necessary and that as to the Rape he wondered by what Witchcraft that should come to her Ears but it had indeed cost him an Hundred Pounds to hush the Affair  The  Greenhats  are a Family with small Voices and short Arms therefore they have Power with none but their Friends They never call after those who run away from them or pretend to take hold of you if you resist But it has been remark∣able that all who have shunned their Com∣pany or not listened to them have fallen into the Hands of such as have knock'd out their own Brains or broken their Bones I have looked over our Pedigree upon the Receipt of this Epi∣stle and find the  Greenhats  are akin to the  Staffs  They descend from  Maudlin  the Lefthanded Wife of  Nehemiah Bickerstaff  in the Reign of  Harry  II And it is remarkable that they are all Lefthanded and have always been very expert at Single Rapier A Man must be very much used to their Play to know how to defend himself for their Posture is so different from that of the Right handed that you run upon their Swords if you push forward and they are in with you if you offer to fall back without keep∣ing your Guard  There have been also Letters lately sent to me which relate to other People Among the rest some whom I have heretofore declared to be so are deceased I must not therefore break thro'  Rules so far as to speak ill of the Dead This Maxim

from  Tournay  That on the Night be∣tween the d and d they went on with their Works in the Enemy's Mines and levelled the Earth which was taken out of them The next Day at in the Morning when the  French  observed we were relieving our Trenches they sprung a larger Mine than any they had fired during this Siege which killed only four private Centinels The en∣suing Night we had three Men and two Officers killed as also seven Men wounded Between the th and th we repair'd some Works which the Enemy had ruin'd On the next Day some of the Enemy's Magazines blew up and it is thought they were destroy'd on Purpose by some of their Men who are impatient of the Hardships of the present Service There happened nothing remarkable for two or three Days following A Deserter who came out of the Citadel on the th says the Garrison is brought to the utmost Necessi∣ty That their Bread and Water are both very bad and that they were reduced to eat HorseFlesh The Manner of fighting in this Siege has discovered a Gallantry in our Men unknown to former Ages their meeting with adverse Parties under Ground where every Step is taken with Apprehensions of being blown up with Mines below them or crushed by the Fall of the Earth above them and all this acted in Dark∣ness has something in it more terrible than ever is met with in any other Part of a Soldier's Duty However this is performed with great Chearfulness In other Parts of the War we have also good Prospects Count  Thaun  has ta∣ken  Annecy  and the Count  de Merci  march'd into  Franche Compte  while his Electoral Highness is much superior in Number to Monsieur  d'Harcourt  so that both on the Side of  Savoy  and  Germany  we have Reason to expect very suddenly some great Event  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Aug  to  Saturd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  TO proceed regularly in the History of my Worthies I ought to give you an Account of what has passed from Day to Day in this Place but a young Fellow of my Acquaintance has so lately been rescued out of the Hands of the Knights of the Industry that I rather chuse to relate the Manner of his Escape from 'em and the uncommon Way which was used to reclaim him than to go on in my intended Diary  You are to know then that  Tom Wildair  is a Student of the  Inner Temple  and has spent his Time since he left the University for that Place in the common Diversions of Men of Fashion that is to say in Whoring Drinking and Gaming The Two former Vices he had from his Father but was led into the last by the Conversation of a Partizan of the  Mirmidons  who had Chambers near him His Allowance from his Father was a very plentiful one for a Man of Sense but as scanty for a modern Fine Gentleman His fre∣quent Losses had reduced him to so necessitous a Condition that his Lodgings were always haunt∣ed by impatient Creditors and all his Thoughts employed in contriving low Methods to support himself in a Way of Life from which he knew not how to retreat and in which he wanted  Means to proceed There is never wanting some goodnatured Person to send a Man an Account of what he has no Mind to hear therefore many Epistles were conveyed to the Father of this Ex∣travagant to inform him of the Company the Pleasures the Distresses and Entertainments in which his Son passed his Time The old Fellow received these Advices with all the Pain of a Pa∣rent but frequently consulted his Pillow to know how to behave himself on such important Occasions as the Welfare of his Son and the Safety of his Fortune After many Agitations of Mind he reflected That Necessity was the usual Snare which made Men fall into Meanness and that a liberal Fortune generally made a liberal and honest Mind he resolved therefore to save him from his Ruin by giving him Opportunities of tasting what it is to be at Ease and enclosed to him the following Order upon Sir  Tristram Cash  SIR  Pray pay to Mr  Tho Wildair  or Order the Sum of one Thousand Pounds and place it to the Account of  Yours  Humphrey Wildair  T    was so astonished at the Receipt of this Order that though he knew it to be his Father's Hand and that he had always large Sums at Sir  Tristram  's yet a Thousand Pounds was a Trust of which his Conduct had always made him appear so little capable that he kept his Note by him till he writ to his Father the fol∣lowing Letter  Honoured Father  I Have received an Order under your Hand for a Thousand Pounds in Words at Length and I think I could swear it is your Hand I have looked  it over and over Twenty Thousand Times There it in plain Letters T H O U S A N D and af∣ter it the Letters P O U N D S I have it still by me and shall I believe continue reading it till I hear from you  The old Gentleman took no Manner of Notice of the Receipt of his Letter but sent him ano∣ther Order for Three Thousand Pounds more His Amazement on this second Letter was un∣speakable He immediately doublelock'd his Door and sate down carefully to reading and comparing both his Orders After he had read 'em till he was half mad he walked Six or Seven Turns in his Chamber then opens his Door then locks it again and to examine throughly this Matter he locks his Door again puts his Table and Chairs against it then goes into his Closet and locking himself in read his Notes over again about Nineteen Times which did but increase his Astonishment Soon after he began to recollect many Stories he had for∣merly heard of Persons who had been possessed with Imaginations and Appearances which had no Foundation in Nature but had been taken with sudden Madness in the Midst of a seeming clear and untainted Reason This made him very gravely conclude he was out of his Wits and with a Design to compose himself he immediate∣ly betakes him to his Nightcap with a Reso∣lution to sleep himself into his former Poverty and Senses To Bed therefore he goes at NoonDay but soon rose again and resolved to visit Sir  Tristam  upon this Occasion He did so and dined with the Knight expecting he would men∣tion some Advice from his Father about paying him Money but no such Thing being said Look you Sir  Tristram  said he you are to know that an Affair has happened whichLook you says  Tristram  I know Mr  Wildair  you are going to desire me to advance but the late Call of the Bank where I have not yet made my last Payment has obliged me  Tom  interrupted him by showing him the Bill of a Thousand Pounds When he had looked at it for a convenient Time and as often surveyed  Tom  's Looks and Countenance Look you Mr  Wildair  a Thousand PoundsBefore he could pro∣ceed he shows him the Order for Three Thou∣sand moreSir  Tristram  examined the Or∣ders at the Light and finding at the writing the Name there was a certain Stroke in one Letter which the Father and he had agreed should be to such Directions as he desired might be more immediately honoured he forthwith pays the Money The Possession of Four Thousand Pounds gave my young Gentleman a new Train of Thoughts He began to reflect upon his Birth the great Expectations he was born to and the unsuitable Ways he had long pursued Instead of that unthinking Creature he was before he is now provident generous and discreet The Father and Son have an exact and regular Cor∣respondence with mutual and unreserved Confi∣dence in each other The Son looks upon his Father as the best Tenant he could have in the Country and the Father finds the Son the most safe Banker he could have in the City  Will's Coffeehouse  August  There is not any Thing in Nature so extrava∣gant but that you will find one Man or other that shall practise or maintain it otherwise  Harry Spondee  could not have made so long an Harangue as he did here this Evening concerning the Force and Efficacy of wellapplied Nonsence Among Ladies he positively averr'd it was the most prevailing Part of Eloquence and had so little Complaisance as to say a Woman is never taken by her Reason but always by her Passion He proceeded to assert the Way to move that  was only to astonish her I know continued he a very late Instance of this for being by Accident in the next Room to  Strephon  I could not help overhearing him as he made Love to a certain great Lady's Woman The true Method in your Application to one of this second Rank of Understanding is not to elevate and surprize but rather to elevate and amaze  Strephon  is a perfect Master in this Kind of Perswasion His Way is to run over with a soft Air a Multitude of Words without Meaning or Connexion but such as do each of 'em apart give a pleasing Idea though they have nothing to do with each other as he assembles 'em After the common Phrases of Salutation and making his Entry into the Room I perceived he had taken the fair Nymph's Hand and kissing it said Witness to my Happiness ye Groves Be still ye Rivulets Oh Woods Caves Fountains Trees Dales Mountains Hills and Streams Oh Fairest Could you love me To which I

Chocolatehouse  August  AMong many Phrases which have crept into Conversation especially of such Company as frequent this Place there is not one which misleads me more than that of a  Fellow of a great deal of Fire  This Metaphorical Term  Fire  has done much Good in keeping Coxcombs in Awe  of one another but at the same Time it has made 'em troublesome to every Body else You see in the very Air of a  Fellow of Fire  something so ex∣pressive of what he would be at that if it were not for SelfPreservation a Man would laugh out  I had last Night the Fate to drink a Bottle with Two of these  Firemen  who are indeed dispersed like the  Mirmidons  in all Quarters and to be met with among those of the most diffe∣rent Education One of my Companions was a Scholar with  Fire  the other a Soldier of the same Complexion My learned Man would fall into Disputes and argue without any Manner of Provocation or Contradiction The other was decisive without Words and would give a Shrug or an Oath to express his Opinion My learned Man was a meer Scholar and my Man of War as meer a Soldier The Particularity of the First was ridiculous that of the Second terrible They were Relations by Blood which in some Measure moderated their Extravagancies to∣wards each other I gave my self up meerly as a Person of no Note in the Company but as if brought to be convinced that I was an incon∣siderable Thing any otherwise than that they would show each other to me and make me Spectator of the Triumph they alternately en∣joy'd The Scholar has been very conversant with Books and the other with Men only which makes 'em both superficial For the Taste of Books is necessary to our Behaviour in the best Company and the Knowledge of Men is required for a true Relish of Books But they have both  Fire  which makes one pass for a Man of Sense and the other for a Fine Gentleman I found I could easily enough pass my Time with the Scholar for if I seem'd not to do Ju∣stice to his Parts and Sentiments he pitied me and let me alone But the Warrior could not let it rest there I must know all that happen'd  within his shallow Observations of the Nature of the War To all which he  dded an Air of Laziness and Contempt of those of his Compa∣nions who were eminent for delighting in the Exercise and Knowledge of their Duty Thus it is that all the young Fellows of much animal Life and little Understanding that repair to our Armies usurp upon the Conversation of reason∣able Men under the Notion of having  Fire  The Word has not been of greater Use to shal∣low Lovers to supply them with Chat to their Mistresses than it has been to pretended Men of Pleasure to support them in being pert and dull and saying of every Fool of their Order  Such a one has Fire  There is Colonel  Truncheon  who marches with Divisions ready on all Occasions an Hero who never doubted in his Life but is ever positively fix'd in the Wrong not out of ob∣stinate Opinion but invincible Stupidity  It is very unhappy for this Latitude of  London  that it is possible for such as can learn only Fa∣shion Habit and a Set of common Phrases of Salutation to pass with no other Accomplish∣ments in this Nation of Freedom for Men of Conversation and Sense All these ought to pre∣tend to is not to offend but they carry it so far as to be negligent whether they offend or not  For they have Fire  But their Force differs from true Spirit as much as a vicious from a mettlesome Horse A Man of  Fire  is a general Enemy to all the Waiters where you drink is the only Man affronted at the Company's being neglected and makes the Drawers abroad his Valet de Chambre and Footmen at home know he is not to be provoked without Danger  This is not the  Fire  that animates the noble  Mari∣nus  a Youth of good Nature Affability and Mo∣deration He commands his Ship as an Intelli∣gence moves its Orb He is the vital Life and his Officers the Limbs of the Machine His Vi∣vacity  is seen in doing all the Offices of Life with Readiness of Spirit and Propriety in the Manner of doing them To be ever active in laudable Pursuits is the distinguishing Chara∣cter of a Man of Merit while the Common Be∣haviour of every gay Coxcomb of  Fire  is to be confidently in the Wrong and dare to persist in it  Will's Coffeehouse  August  It is a common Objection against Writings of a Satyrical Mixture that they hurt Men in their Reputations and consequently in their Fortunes and Possessions but a Gentleman who frequents this Room declared he was of Opinion it ought to be so provided such Performances had their proper Restrictions The greatest Evils in hu∣mane Society are such as no Law can come at as in the Case of Ingratitude where the Man∣ner of obliging very often leaves the Benefactor without Means of demanding Justice though that very Circumstance should be the more bind∣ing to the Person who has received the Benefit On such an Occasion shall it be possible for the Malefactor to escape And is it not lawful to set Marks upon Persons who live within the Law and do base Things Shall not we use the same Protection of those Laws to punish them which they have to defend themselves We shall there∣fore take it for a very moral Action to find a good Appellation for Offenders and to turn them into Ridicule under feigned Names  I am advertised by a Letter of  August  the th That the Name of  Coppersmith  has very much wanted Explanation in the City and by that Means unjustly given by those who are conscious they deserve it themselves to an honest and worthy Citizen belonging to the  CopperOffice  but that Word is framed out of a moral Conside∣ration of Wealth amongst Men whereby he that has gotten any Part of it by Injustice and Extor∣tion  is to be thought in the Eye of virtuous Men so much the poorer for such Gain Thus all the Gold which is torn from our Neighbours by making Advantage of their Wants is Cop∣per and I authorize the  Lombards  to distinguish themselves accordingly All the honest who make a reasonable Profit both for the Advantage of themselves and those they deal with are Gold∣smiths but those who tear unjustly all they can Coppersmiths At the same Time I desire him who is most guilty to sit down satisfied with Riches and Contempt and be known by the Ti∣tle of  The Coppersmith  as being the Chief of that respected contemptible Fraternity  This is the Case of all others mentioned in our Lucubrations particularly of  Stentor  who goes on in his Vociferations at St  Paul  's with so much Obstinacy that he has received Admonition from St  Peter  's for it from a Person of eminent Wit and Piety but who is by old Age reduced to the Infirmity of sleeping at a Service to which he has been Fifty Years attentive and whose Death whenever it happens may with that of the Saints well be called Falling asleep for the Innocence of his Life makes him expect it as in∣differently as he does his ordinary Rest This gives him a Chearfulness of Spirit to rally his own Weakness and hath made him write to  Stentor  to hearken to my Admonitions Brother  Stentor  said he for the Repose of the Church hearken to  Bickerstaff  and consider that while you are so devout at St  Paul  's we cannot sleep for you at St  Peter  's  From my own Apartment  August  There has been lately sent me a much harder Question than was ever yet put to me since I pro∣fessed Astrology to wit How far and to what Age Women ought to make their Beauty their chief Concern The Regard and Care of their Faces and Persons are as variously to be consi∣der'd  as their Complexions themselves differ but if one may transgress against the careful Practice of the Fair Sex so much as to give an Opinion against it I humbly presume that less Care better apply'd would increase their Empire and make it last as long as Life Whereas now from their own Example we take our Esteem of their Merit from it for it is very just that she who values her self only on her Beauty should be re∣garded by others on no other Consideration  There is certainly a liberal and pedantick Edu∣cation among Women as well as Men and the Merit lasts accordingly She therefore that is bred with Freedom and in good Company con∣siders Men according to their respective Chara∣cters and Distinctions while she that is lock'd up from such Observations will consider her Father's Butler not as a Butler but as a Man In like Manner when Men converse with Women the Wellbred and Intelligent are looked upon with an Observation suitable to their different Talents and Accomplishments without Respect to their Sex while a meer Woman can be observed under no Consideration but that of a Woman and there can be but one Reason for placing any Value up∣on her or losing Time in her Company Where∣fore I am of Opinion that the Rule for pleasing long is to obtain such Qualifications as would make them so were they not Women  Let the beauteous  Cleomira  then shew us her real Face and know that every Stage of Life has its peculiar Charms and that there is no Necessity for Fifty to be Fifteen That Childish colouring of her Cheeks is now as ungraceful as that Shape would have been when her Face wore its real Countenance She has Sense and ought to know that if she will not follow Nature Nature will follow her Time then has made that Person which had when I visited her Grandfather an agreeable  Bloom sprightly Air and soft Utterance now no less graceful in a lovely Aspect an awful Man∣ner and material Wisdom But her Heart was so set upon her first Character that she neglects and repines at her present not that she is against a more stay'd Conduct in others for she recom∣mends Gravity Circumspection and Severity of Countenance to her Daughter Thus against all Chronology the Girl is the Sage the Mother the Fine Lady  But these great Evils proceed from an unac∣countable wild Method in the Education of the better half of the World the Women We have no such Thing as a Standard for good Breeding I was the other Day at my Lady  Wealthy  's and asked one of her Daughters How she did She answer'd She never convers'd with Men The same Day I visited at Lady  Plantwell  's and ask'd her Daughter the same Question She answers What's that to you you old Thief And gives me a Slap on the Shoulders  I defy any Man in  England  except he knows the Family before he enters to be able to iudge whether he shall be agreeable or not when he comes into it You find either some odd old Woman who is permitted to rule as long as she lives in Hopes of her Death and to interrupt all Things or some impertinent young Woman who will talk sillily upon the Strength of looking beautifully I will not answer for it but it may be that I like all other old Fellows have a Fondness for the Fa∣shions and Manners which prevailed when I was young and in Fashion my self But cer∣tain it is that the Taste of Grace and Beauty is very much lower'd The Fine Women they show me nowadays are at best but pretty Girls to me who have seen  Sacharissa  when all the World repeated the Poems she inspir'd  and  Villaria  when a youthful King was her Subject The Things you follow and make Songs on now should be sent to knit or sit down to Bobbins or BoneLace They are in∣deed neat and so are their Sempstresses they are pretty and so are their Handmaids But that graceful Motion that awful Mien and that winning Attraction which grew upon 'em from the Thoughts and Conversations they met with in my Time are now no more seen They tell me I am old I am glad I am so for I don't like your present young Ladies  Those among us who set up for any Thing of Decorum do so mistake the Matter that they of∣fend on the other Side Five young Ladies who are of no small Fame for their great Severity of Manners and exemplary Behaviour would lately go no where with their Lovers but to an OrganLoft in a Church where they had a Cold Treat and some few Opera Songs to their great Refreshment and Edification Whether these prudent Persons had not been as much so if this had been done at a Tavern is not very hard to determine 'Tis such silly Starts and Inco∣herences as these which undervalue the beau∣teous Sex and puzzle us in our Choice of Sweetness of Temper and Simplicity of Man∣ners which are the only lasting Charms of Wo∣man But I must leave this important Subject at present for some Matters which press for Publication as you will observe in the following Letter  Dear Sir  'TIS natural for distant Relations to claim Kindred with a rising Family though at this Time Zeal to my Country not Interest calls me out The City Forces being shortly to take the Field all good Protestants would be pleased that their Arms and Valour should shine with equal  Lustre A Council of War was lately held the Honourable Colonel  Mortar  being President After many Debates 'twas unanimously resolved That Major  Blunder  a most expert Officer should be detached for  Bromingham  to buy Arms and to prove his Firelocks on the Spot as well to pre∣vent Expence as Disappointment in the Day of Battle The Major being a Person of consummate Experience was invested with a Discretionary Power He knew from ancient Story that secu∣ring the Rear and making a glorious

N  o    From  Tuesd Aug  to  Thursd Sept    White's Chocolatehouse  August  THIS Place being frequented by Persons of Condition I am desired to recommend a Dogkennel to any who shall want a Pack It lies not far from  Suffolkstreet  and is kept by Two who were formerly Dragoons in the  French  Service but left Plundering for the more order∣ly Life of keeping Dogs Besides that according to their Expectation they find it more profitable as well as more conducing to the Safety of their Skin to follow this Trade than the Beat of Drum Their Residence is very convenient for the Dogs to whelp in and bring up a right Breed to follow the Scent The most eminent of the Kennel are Bloodhounds which lead the Van and are as follow  A List of the Dogs  Jowler  of a right  Irish  Breed called Captain  Rockwood  of  French  Race with long Hair by the Courtesy of  England  called also Cap∣tain  Pompey  a tall Hound kennelled in a  Convent  in  France  and knows a rich Soil  These Two last hunt in Couple and are fol∣lowed by  Ringwood  a  French  black Whelp of the same Breed a fine openmouth'd Dog and an old sick Hound always in Kennel but of the true Blood with a good Nose  French  Breed  There is also an  Italian  Greyhound with good Legs and knows perfectly the Ground from  Ghent  to  Paris  Ten SettingDogs right  English  Four Mongrels of the same Nation  And Twenty Whelps fit for any Game  These Curs are so extremely hungry that they are too keen at the Sport and worry their Game before the Keepers can come in The other Day a WildBoar from the North rushed into the Kennel and at first indeed defended himself a∣gainst the whole Pack but they proved at last too many for him and tore Pounds of Flesh from off his Back with which they filled their Bellies and made so great a Noise in the Neigh∣bourhood that the Keepers are obliged to hasten the Sale That Quarter of the Town where they are kennell'd is generally inhabited by Strangers whose Blood the Hounds have often sucked in such a Manner that many a  German  Count and other  Virtuosi  who came from the Continent have lost the Intention of their Travels and been unable to proceed on their Journey  If these Hounds are not very soon disposed of to some good Purchaser as also those at the Ken∣nels nearer St  James  's it is humbly proposed that they may be altogether transported to  America  where the Dogs are few and the WildBeasts many Or that during their Stay in these Parts some eminent Justice of the Peace may have it in particular Direction to visit their Harbours and that the Sheriff of  Middlesex  may allow him the Assistance of the Common Hang∣man to cut off their Ears or Part of them for Distinctionsake that we may know the Blood∣hounds from the Mongrels and Setters Till these Things are regulated you may inquire at an House belonging to  Paris  at the upper End of  SuffolkStreet  or an House belonging to  Ghent  opposite to the lower End of  PullMall  and know further  It were to be wished that these Curs were dis∣posed of for it is a very great Nusance to have them tolerated in Cities That of  London  takes Care that the Common Hunt assisted by the Sergeants and Bailiffs expel them wherever they are found within the Walls though 'tis said some private Families keep them to the Destru∣ction of their Neighbours But it is desired that all who know of any of these Curs or have been bit by them would send me their Marks and the Houses where they are harboured and I do not doubt but I shall alarm the People so well as to have them used like mad Dogs where∣ever they appear In the mean Time I advise all such as entertain this kind of Vermin that if they give me timely Notice that their Dogs are dismissed I shall let them go unregarded otherwise am obliged to admonish my Fellow Subjects in this Behalf and instruct them how to avoid being worried when they are going about their lawful Professions and Callings There was lately a young Gentleman bit to the Bone who has now indeed recovered his Health but is as lean as a Skeleton It grieved my Heart to see a Gentleman's Son run among the Hounds but he is they tell me as fleet and as dangerous as the best of the Pack  Will's Coffeehouse  August  This Evening was spent at our Table in Dis∣course of Propriety of Words and Thoughts which is Mr  Dryden  's Definition of Wit but a very odd Fellow who would intrude upon us and has a Briskness of Imagination more like Mad∣ness than regular Thought said that  Harry Jacks  was the first who told him of the taking of the Citadel of  Tournay  and says he  Harry  de∣serves a Statue more than the Boy who ran to the Senate with a Thorn in his Foot to tell of a  Victory We were astonish'd at the Assertion and  Spondee  asked him What Affinity is there be∣tween that Boy and  Harry  that you say then Merit resembles so much as you just now told us Why says he  Harry  you know is in the  French  Interest and it was more Pain to him to tell the Story of  Tournay  than to the Boy to run upon a Thorn to relate a Victory which he was glad of The Gentleman who was in the Chair upon the Subject of Propriety of Words and Thoughts would by no Means allow that there was Wit in this Comparison and urged that to have any Thing gracefully said it must be natural but that whatsoever was introduced in common Discourse with so much Premedita∣tion was insufferable That Critick went on Had Mr  Jacks  said he told him the Citadel was taken and another had answer'd He de∣serves a Statue as well as the  Roman  Boy for he told it with as much Pain it might have pas∣sed for a sprightly Expression But there is a Wit for Discourse and a Wit for Writing The Easiness and Familiarity of the first is not to sa∣vour in the least of Study but the Exactness of the other is to admit of something like the Freedom of Discourse especially in Treatises of Humanity and what regards the  Belles Lettres  I do not in this allow that  Bickerstaff  's  Tatlers  or Discourses of Wit by Retail and for the Penny should come within the Description of  Writing  I bowed at his Compliment andBut he would not let me proceed  You see in no Place of Conversation the Perfection of Speech so much as in an accomplished Woman Whether it be that there is a Partiality irresistible when we judge of that Sex or whatever it is you may observe a wonderful Freedom in their Utterance and an easy Flow of Words with∣out being distracted as we often are who read much in the Choice of Dictions and Phrases  My Lady  Courtly  is an Instance of this She was talking the other Day of Dress and did it with so excellent an Air and Gesture that you would have sworn she had learned her Action from our  Demosthenes  Besides which her Words were so particularly well adapted to the Matter she talked of that tho' Dress was a new Thing to us Men she avoided the Terms of Art in it and described an unaffected Garb and Manner in so proper Terms that she came up to that  Horace  's  Simplex Munditiis  which whoever can translate in Two Words has as much Eloquence as Lady  Courtly  I took the Liberty to tell her That all she had said with so much good Grace was spoken in Two Words in  Horace  but would not undertake to translate them upon which she smiled and told me She believed me a very great Scholar and I took my Leave  From my own Apartment  August  I have been just now reading the Introduction to the History of  Catiliue  by  Sallust  an Author who is very much in my Favour but when I re∣flect upon his professing himself wholly disinte∣rested and at the same Time see how industri∣ously he has avoided saying any Thing to the Praise of  Cicero  to whose Vigilance the Com∣monwealth owed its Safety it very much lessens my Esteem for that Writer and is one Argument among others for laughing at all who pretend to be out of the Interests of the World and pro∣fess purely to act for the Service of Mankind without the least Regard to themselves I do not deny but that the Rewards are different some aim at Riches others at Honour by their publick Services However they are all pur∣suing some End to themselves though indeed those Ends differ as much as Right and Wrong The most graceful Way then I should think would be to acknowledge that you aim at ser∣ving your selves but at the same Time make it  appear it is for the Service of others that you have these Opportunities  Of all the disinterested Professors I have ever heard of I take the Boatswain of  Dampier  's Ship to be the most impudent but the must excusable You are to know that in the wild Searches that Navigator was making they happen'd to be out at Sea far distant from any Shore in Want of all the Necessaries of Life insomuch that they be∣gan to look not without Hunger on each other The Boatswain was a fat healthy fresh Fellow and attracted the Eyes of the whole Crew In such an extreme Necessity all Forms of Superio∣rity were laid aside The Captain and Lieute∣nant were safe only by being Carrion and the unhappy Boatswain in Danger only by being worth eating To be short the Company were unani∣mous and the Boatswain must be cut up He saw their Intention and desired he might speak a few Words before they proceeded which being permitted he delivered himself as follows  Gentlemen Sailors  Far be it that I should speak it for any private Interest of my own but I take it that I should not die with a good Conscience if I did not confess to you that I am not sound I say Gentlemen Justice and the Testimony of a good Conscience as well as Love of my Country to which I hope you will all return oblige me to own that Black Kate at  Dept∣ford  has made me very unsafe to eat and I speak it with Shame I am afraid Gentlemen I should poison you  This Speech had a good Effect in the Boatswain's Favour but the Surgeon of the Ship protested he had cured him very well and offered to eat the first Stake of him himself  The Boatswain replied like an Orator with a true Notion of the People and in Hopes to gain Time That he was heartily glad if he could be for their Service and thanked the Sur∣geon for his Information However said he I must inform you for your own Good that I have ever since my Cure been very thirsty and dropsical therefore I presume it would be much better to tap me and drink me off than eat me at once and have no Man in the Ship fit to be drank As he was going on with his Harangue a fresh Gale arose and gave the Crew Hopes of a better Repast at the nearest Shore to which they arrived next Morning  Most of the SelfDenials we meet with are of this Sort therefore I think he acts fairest who owns he hopes at least to have Brother's Fare without professing that he gives himself up with Pleasure to be devoured for the Preservation of his Fellows  St James's Coffeehouse  Aug  Letters from the  Hague  of the th of  Septem∣ber N S  say That the Governor of the Cita∣del of  Tournay  having offered their Highnesses the Duke of  Marlborough  and the Prince of  Sa∣voy  to surrender that Place on the st of the last Month on Terms which were not allowed them by those Princes Hostilities were there∣upon renewed but that on the d the Place was surrendered with a seeming Condition grant∣ed to the Besieged above that of being Priso∣ners of War for they were forthwith to be conducted to  Condé  but were to be exchanged for Prisoners of the Allies and particularly those of  Warniton  were mentioned in the Demand Both Armies having stretched towards  Mons  with the utmost Diligence that of the Allies though they passed the much more difficult Road arrived first before that Town which they have now actually invested and the Quarter∣masterGeneral  was at the Time of Dispatching these Letters marking the Ground for the En∣campment of the covering Army  To the Booksellers or others whom this Adver∣tisement may concern  Mr  Omicron  the Unborn Poet gives Notice That he writes all Treatises as well in Verse as Prose being a Ninth Son and translates out of all Languages without Learning or Study  If any Bookseller will treat for his Pastoral on the Siege and Surrender of the Citadel of  Tournay  he must send in his Proposals before the News of a Capitulation for any other Town  The Undertaker for either Play house may have an Opera written by him or if it shall suit their Design a Satyr upon Opera's both ready for next Winter  This is to give Notice That  Richard Far∣loe  M A well known for his Acuteness in Dis∣section of dead Bodies and his great Skill in Osteo∣logy has now laid by that Practice and

Entrance from  Newgatestreet  into  Christ  's Hospital  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Sept    White's Chocolatehouse  Sept  Of the Enjoyment of Life with Regard to others  I Have ever thought it the greatest Diminution to the  Roman  Glory imaginable that in their Institution of Publick Triumphs they led their Enemies in Chains when they were Prisoners It is to be allowed that doing all Honour to the Superiority of Heroes above the rest of Man∣kind must needs conduce to the Glory and Ad∣vantage of a Nation but what shocks the Imagination to reflect upon is that a polite People should think it reasonable that an un∣happy Man who was no Way inferior to the Victor but by the Chance of War should be led like a Slave at the Wheels of his Cha∣riot Indeed these other Circumstances of a Triumph That it was not allowed in a Ci∣vil War lest Part of it should be in Tears while the other was making Acclamations That it should not be granted except such a Number were slain in Battle That the Ge∣neral should be disgraced who made a false Muster of his Dead These I say had great and politick Ends in their being establish'd and ten∣ded to the apparent Benefit of the Common∣wealth But this Behaviour to the Conquered  had no Foundation in Nature or Policy only to gratify the Insolence of an haughty People who triumphed over barbarous Nations by acting what was fit only for those very Barbarians to practise It seems wonderful that they who were so refined as to take Care that to compleat the Honour done to the victorious Officer no Power should be known above him in the Em∣pire on the Day of his Triumph but that the Consuls themselves should be but Guests at his Table that Evening could not take it into Thought to make the Man of chief Note among his Pri∣soners one of the Company This would have improved the Gladness of the Occasion and the Victor had made a much greater Figure in that no other Man appeared unhappy on his Day than because no other Man appeared great  But we will wave at present such important In∣cidents and turn our Thoughts rather to the familiar Part of humane Life and we shall find that the great Business we contend for is in a less Degree what those  Romans  did on more solemn Occasions to triumph over our Fellow Creatures and there is hardly a Man to be found who would not rather be in Pain to appear happy than be really happy and thought mise∣rable This Men attempt by sumptuous Equi∣pages splendid Houses numerous Servants and all the Cares and Pursuits of an ambitious or fa∣shionable Life  Bromeo  and  Tabio  are particularly Illwishers to each other and Rivals in Happiness There is no Way in Nature so good to procure the Esteem of the one as to give him little Notices of certain secret Points wherein the other is uneasy  Gnath  has the Skill of doing this and never applauds the Improvements  Bromeo  has been many Years ma∣king and ever will be making but he adds  'Now this very Thing was my Thought when  Tabio  was pulling up his Underwood yet he never would  hear of it but now your Gardens are in this Posture he is ready to hand himself Well to be sincere that Situation of his can never make an agreeable Seat He may make his House and Appurtenances what he pleases but he cannot remove them to the same Ground where  Bromeo  stands and of all Things under the Sun a Man that is happy at Secondhand is the most monstrous"  'Tis a very strange Madness answers  Bromeo  if a Man on these Occasions can think of any End but pleasing himself As for my Part if Things are convenient I hate all Ostentation There is no End of the Folly of adapting our Affairs to the Imagination of others Upon which the next Thing he does is to en∣large whatever he hears his Rival has attempted to imitate him in but their Misfortune is that they are in their Time of Life in their Estates and in their Understandings equal so that the Emulation may continue to the last Day of their Lives As it stands now  Tabio  has heard  Bromeo  has lately purchased Two Hundred a Year in the Annuities since he has settled the Account of their Happiness in which he thought himself to have the Ballance This may seem a very fantastical Way of Thinking in these Men but there is nothing so common as a Man's endea∣vouring rather to go further than some other Person towards an easy Fortune than to form any certain Standard that would make himself happy  Will's Coffeehouse  September  Mr  Dactile  has been this Evening very profuse of his Eloquence upon the Talent of turning Things into Ridicule and seemed to say very justly That there was generally in it something too disingenuous for the Society of liberal Men except it were governed by the Circumstances of Persons Time and Place This Talent con∣tinued  he is to be used as a Man does his Sword not to be drawn but in his own Defence or to bring Pretenders and Impostors in Society to a true Light But we have seen this Faculty so mistaken that the Burlesque of  Virgil  himself has passed among Men of little Tast for Wit and the noblest Thoughts that can enter into the Heart of Man levelled with Ribaldry and Bafe∣ness Though by the Rules of Justice no Man ought to be ridiculed for any Imperfection who does not set up for eminent Sufficiency in that Way wherein he is defective Thus Cowards who would hide themselves by an affected Ter∣ror in their Mien and Dress and Pedants who would show the Depth of their Knowledge by a supercilious Gravity are equally the Objects of Laughter Not that they are in themselves ridiculous for their Want of Courage or Weak∣ness of Understanding but that they seem insen∣sible of their own Place in Life and unhappily rank themselves with those whose Abilities com∣pared to their Defects make them contemptible  At the same Time it must be remarked That Risibility being the Effect of Reason a Man ought to be expelled from sober Company who laughs without it Ha ha says  Will Truby  who sat by Will any Man pretend to give me Laws when I should laugh or tell me what I should laugh at Look ye answer'd  Humphrey Slyboots  you are mightily mistaken you may if you please make what Noise you will and no Body can hinder an  English  Gentleman from put∣ting his Face into what Posture he thinks fit but take my Word for it that Motion which you now make with your Mouth open and the Agitation of your Stomach which you re∣lieve by holding your Sides is not Laughter Laughter is a more weighty Thing than you imagine and I'll tell you a Secret You ne∣ver did laugh in your Life and truly I am  afraid you never will except you take great Care to be cured of those Convulsive Fits  Truby  left us and when he had got Two Yards from us Well said he you are strange Fellows and was immediately taken with another Fit  The  Trubies  are a wellnatured Family whose particular Make is such that they have the same Pleasure out of good Will which other People have in that Scorn which is the Cause of Laugh∣ter Therefore their bursting into the Figures of Men when laughing proceeds only from a ge∣neral Benevolence they are born with as the  Sly∣boots  smile only on the greatest Occasion of Mirth which Difference is caused rather from a different Structure of their Organs than that one is less moved than the other I know  Sowerly  frets in∣wardly when  Will Truby  laughs at him but when I meet him and he bursts out I know 'tis out of his abundant Joy to see me which he ex∣presses by that Vociferation which is in others Laughter But I shall defer considering this Sub∣ject at large till I come to my Treatise of Osci∣tation Laughter and Ridicule  From my own Apartment  September  The following Letter being a Panegyrick upon me for a Quality which every Man may attain an Acknowledgment of his Faults I thought it for the Good of my FellowWriters to publish it  SIR  IT must be allowed that Esquire  Bickerstaff  is of all Authors the most ingenuous There are few very few that will own themselves in a Mistake though all the World see them to be in downright Nonsence You'll be pleased Sir to pardon this Expression for the same Reason for which you once desired us to excuse you when you seem'd any thing dull Most Writers like the Generality of  Paul I orrain's  Saints seem to place a peculiar Vanity in dying hard But you Sir to show a good Ex∣ample  to your Brethren have not only confessed but of your own Accord mended the Indictment Nay you have been so goodnatured as to discover Beau∣ties in it which I'll assure you he that drew it never dreamed of And to make your Civility the more accomplish'd you have honoured him with the Title of your Kinsman which though derived by the LeftHand he is not a little proud of My Bro∣ther for such  Obadiah  is being at present very busy

be∣longs more properly to you than to any others of our modern Historians  Madonella  who as 'twas thought had long since taken her Flight towards the Aetherial Mansions still walks it seems in the Regions of Mortality where she has found by deep Reflections on the Revolution mentioned in yours of  June  the  d That where early Instructions have been wanting to imprint true Idea's of Things on the tender Souls of those of her Sex they are never after able to arrive at such a Pitch of Perfection as to be above the Laws of Matter and Motion Laws which are considerably inforced by the Principles usually imbibed in Nurseries and BoardingSchools To remedy this Evil she has laid the Scheme of a College for young Damsels where instead of Scissors Needles and Samplers Pens Compasses Quadrants Books Manuscripts Greek Latin and Hebrew are to take up their whole Time Only on Holidays the Students will for moderate Exercise be allowed to divert them∣selves with the Use of some of the lightest and most voluble Weapons and proper Care will be taken to give them at least a superficial Tincture of the An∣cient and Modern Amazonian Tacticks Of these Military Performances the Direction is undertaken by  Epicene  the Writer of  Memoirs from the Me∣diterranean  who by the Help of some artificial Poi∣sons  conveyed by Smells has within these few Weeks brought many Persons of both Sexes to an untimely Fate and what is more surprising has contrary to her Profession with the same Odors revived others who had long since been drowned in the Whirl∣pools of  Lethe  Another of the Professors is to be a certain Lady who is now publishing Two of the choicest  Saxon  Novels which are said to have been in as great Repute with the Ladies of Queen  Em∣ma  's Court as the  Memoirs from the New Atalan∣tis  are with those of ours I shall make it my Busi∣ness to enquire into the Progress of this learned In∣stitution and give you the first Notice of their Philosophical Transactions and Searches after Na∣ture  Yours  c Tobiah Greenhat  St James's Coffeehouse  Sept  This Day we have received Advices by the Way of  Ostend  which give an Account of an En∣gagement between the  French  and the Allies on the th Instant  N S  Marshal  Boufflers  arri∣ved in the Enemy's Camp on the th and ac∣quainted Marshal  Villars  That he did not come in any Character but to receive his Commands for the King's Service and communicate to him his Orders upon the present Posture of Affairs On the th both Armies advanced to∣wards each other and cannonaded all the ensuing Day till the Close of the Evening and stood on their Arms all that Night On the Day of Battle the Cannonading was renewed a∣bout Seven The Duke of  Argyle  had Or∣ders to attack the Wood  Saar  on the Right which he executed so successfully that he pierced through it and won a considerable Post The Prince of  Orange  had the same good Fortune in a Wood on the Left After which the whole  Body of the Confederates join'd by the Forces from the Siege marched up and engaged the Enemy who were drawn up at some Distance from these Woods The Dispute was very warm for some Time but towards Noon the  French  began to give Ground from one Wing to the other Which Advantage being observed by our Generals the whole Army was urged on with fresh Vigour and in a few Hours the Day ended with the entire Defeat of the Enemy  The TATLER N  o    Quae caret Ora Cruore nostro  From  Saturd Sept  to  Tuesd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  WHen I lately spoke of Triumphs and the Behaviour of the  Romans  on those Occa∣sions I knew by my Skill in Astrology that there was a great Event approaching to our Ad∣vantage but not having yet taken upon me to tell Fortunes I thought fit to defer the Mention of the Battle near  Mons  till it happened which Moderation was no small Pain to me But I should wrong my Art if I conceal'd that some of my Aerial Intelligencers had signified to me the News of it ev'n from  Paris  before the Arri∣val of LieutenantColonel  Graham  in  England  All Nations as well as Persons have their good and evil Genius attending 'em but the King∣dom of  France  has Three the last of which is neither for it nor against it in Reality but has for some Months past acted an ambiguous Part and attempted to save its Ward from the Incur∣sion of its powerful Enemies by little Subter∣fuges  and Tricks which a Nation is more than undone when it is reduced to Practice Thus instead of giving exact Accounts and Representa∣tions of Things they tell what is indeed true but at the same Time a Falshood when all the Circumstances come to be related  Pacolet  was at the Court of  France  on  Friday  Night last when this Genius of that Kingdom came thither in the Shape of a PostBoy and cried out That  Mons  was relieved and the Duke of  Marlborough  marched  Pacolet  was much astonished at this Account and immediately changed his Form and flew to the Neighbourhood of  Mons  from whence he found the Allies had really marched and began to enquire into the Reasons of this sudden Change and half feared he had heard a Truth of the Posture of the  French  Affairs even in their own Country But upon diligent En∣quiry among the Aerials who attend these Regi∣ons and Consultation with the neighbouring Pea∣sants he was able to bring me the following Ac∣count of the Motions of the Armies since they retired from about that Place and the Action which followed thereupon  On  Saturday  the th of  September N S  The Confederate Army was alarm'd in their Camp at  Havre  by Intelligence That the Enemy were marching to attack the Prince of  Hesse  Upon this Advice the Duke of  Marlborough  command∣ed that the Troops should immediately move which was accordingly performed and they were all join'd on  Sunday  the Eighth at Noon On that Day in the Morning it appeared that in∣stead of being attack'd the advanced Guard of the Detachment commanded by the Prince of  Hesse  had dispersed and taken Prisoners a Party of the Enemy's Horse which was sent out to observe the March of the Confederates The  French  moved from  Quiverain  on  Sunday  in the Morning and inclined to the Right from thence  all that Day The th the  Monday  following they continued their March till on  Tuesday  the Tenth they possess'd themselves of the Woods of  Dour  and  Blaugies  As soon as they came into that Ground they threw up Intrenchments with all Expedition The Allies arrived within few Hours after the Enemy was posted but the Duke of  Marlborough  thought fit to wait for the Arrival of the Reinforcement which he expected from the Siege of  Tournay  Upon Notice that these Troops were so far advanced as to be de∣pended on for an Action the next Day it was ac∣cordingly resolv'd to engage the Enemy  It will be necessary for understanding the Great∣ness of the Action and the several Motions made in the Time of the Engagement that you have in your Mind an Idea of the Place The Two Armies on the th Instant were both drawn up before the Woods of  Dour Blangies Sart  and  Jansart  the Army of the Prince of  Savoy  on the Right before that of  Blangies  the Forces of  Groat Britain  in the Center on his Left those of the High Allies with the Wood  Sart  as well as a large Interval of plain Ground and  Jansart  on the Left of the Whole The Enemy were in∣trenched in the Paths of the Woods and drawn up behind Two Intrenchments overagainst them opposite to the Armies of the Duke of  Marlbo∣rough  and Prince  Eugene  There were also Two Lines intrenched in the Plains overagainst the Ar∣my of the States This was the Posture of the  French  and Confederate Forces when the Signal was given and the whole Line moved on to the Charge  The  Dutch  Army commanded by the Prince of  Hesse  attack'd with the most undaunted Bra∣very and after a very obstinate Resistance for∣ced the first Intrenchment of the Enemy in the Plain between  Sart  and  Jansart  but were repulsed in their Attack on the Second with great Slaughter on both Sides The Duke of  Marlborough  while this was tranfacting on the Left had with very much Difficulty marched through  Sart  and beaten the Enemy from the several Intrenchments they had thrown up in it As soon as the Duke had marched into the Plain he observed the main Body of the Enemy drawn up and intrenched in the Front of his Army This Situation of the Enemy in the ordinary Course of War is usually thought an Advantage hardly to be surmounted and might appear im∣practicable to any but that Army which had just overcome greater Difficulties The Duke com∣manded the Troops to form but to forbear charg∣ing till further Order In the mean Time he vi∣sited the Left of our Line where the Troops of the States had been engaged The Slaughter on this Side had been very great and the  Dutch  incapable of making further Progress except they were suddenly reinforced The Right of our Line was attacked soon after their coming upon the Plain but they drove back the Enemy with such Bravery that the Victory began to in∣cline to the Allies by the precipitate Retreat of the  French  to their Works from whence they were immediately beaten The Duke upon ob∣serving this Advantage on the Right commanded the Earl of  Orkney  to march with a sufficient Number of Battalions to force the Enemy from their Intrenchments on the Plain between the Woods of  Sart  and  Jansart  which being per∣formed the Horse of the Allies marched into the Plains covered by their own Foot and form∣ing themselves in good Order the Cavalry of the Enemy attempted no more but to cover the Foot in their Retreat The Allies made so good Use of the beginning of the Victory that all their Troops moved on with fresh Resolution till they saw the Enemy fly before them towards  Condé  and  Maubeuge  after whom proper Detach∣ments were made who made a terrible Slaughter in the Pursuit  In this Action it is said Prince  Eugene  was wound∣ed as also the Duke of  Aremberg  and LieutenantGeneral  Webb  The Count of  Oxenstern  Colo∣nel  Lalo  and Sir  Thomas Pendergrass  were kill'd  This wonderful Success obtain'd under all the Difficulties that could be opposed in the Way of an Army must be acknowledged as owing to the Genius Courage and Conduct of the Duke of  Marlborough  a Consummate Hero who has lived not only beyond the Time in which  Caesar  said He was arrived at a Satiety of Life and Glory but also been so long the Subject of Panegyrick that it is as hard to say any Thing new in his Praise as to add to the Merit which requires such Eulogiums  Will's Coffeehouse  September  The following Letter being very explanatory of the true Design of our Lucubrations and at the same Time an excellent Model for perform∣ing it it is absolutely necessary for the better understanding our Works to publish it  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  THO' I have not the Honour to be of the Fa∣mily of the  Staffs  nor related to any Branch of it yet I applaud your wholesome Project of making Wit useful  This is what has been or should have been intended by the best Comedies But no Body I think before you thought of a Way to bring the Stage as it were into the Coffeehouse and there attack those Gentlemen who thought themselves out of the Reach of Raillery by prudently avoiding its chief Walks and Di∣stricts I smile when I see a solid Citizen of Threescore read the Article from  Will  's  Coffeehouse  and seem to be just beginning to learn his Alphabet of Wit in Spectacles and to hear the attentive Table sometimes stop him with  pertinent Queries which he is puzzled to an∣swer and then join in commending it the sin∣cerest Way by freely owning he don't under∣stand it  In pursuing this Design you will always have a large Scene before you and can never be at a Loss for Characters to entertain a Town so plentifully stock'd with them The Follies of the finest Minds which a Philosophick Surgeon knows how to dissect will best employ your Skill And of this Sort I take the Liberty to send you the following Sketch  Cleontes  is a Man of good Family good Learn∣ing entertaining Conversation and acute Wit He talks well is Master of Style and writes not contemptibly in Verse Yet all this serves but to make him politely ridiculous and he is above the Rank of common Characters only to have the Privilege of being laugh'd at by the Best His Family makes him proud and scorn∣ful his Learning assuming and absurd and his Wit arrogant and satyrical He mixes some of the best Qualities of the Head with the worst of the Heart Every Body is enter∣tain'd by him while no Body esteems him I am  SIR  Your most affectionate Monitor  Josiah Couplet  Lost from the  Tree  in  PallMall  Two  Irish  Dogs belonging to the Pack of  London  one a tall white WolfDog the other a black nimble Grey hound not very sound and suppos'd to be gone to the  Bath  by Instinct for Cure The Man of the Inn from whence they ran being now there is desired if he meets either of them to tie them up Several others are lost about  Tunbridge  and  Epsom  which whoever will maintain may keep  The TATLER N  o    Quicquid agunt Homines nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Tuesd Sept  to  Thursd Sept    Will's Coffeehouse  September  I Came hither this Evening and expected no∣thing else but mutual Congratulations in the Company on the late Victory but found our Room which one would have hoped to have seen full of good Humour and Alacrity upon so glorious an Occasion full of sowr Animals en∣quiring into the Action in Doubt of what had happened and fearful of the Success of their Coun∣tryMen It is natural to believe easily what we wish heartily and a certain Rule That they are not Friends to a glad Occasion who speak all they can against the Truth of it who end their Argument against our Happiness that they wish it otherwise When I came into the Room a Gentleman was declaiming If says he we have so great and compleat a Victory Why have we not the Names of the Prisoners Why is not an exact Relation of the Conduct of our Generals laid be∣fore the World Why do we not know where or whom to applaud If we are victorious Why do we not give an Account of our Captives and our Slain But we are to be satisfy'd with gene∣ral Notices we are Conquerors and to believe it so Sure this is approving the despotick Way of treating the World which we pretend to sight against if we sit down satisfied with such contradictory Accounts which have the Words of Triumph but do not bear the Spirit of it I whispered Mr  Greenhat  Pray what can that dis∣satisfied  Man be He is answered he a Chara∣cter you have not yet perhaps observed You have heard of BattlePainters have mentioned a BattlePoet but this is a BattleCritick He is a Fellow that lives in a Government so gentle that tho' it sees him an Enemy suffers his Malice because they know his Impotence He is to exa∣mine the Weight of an Advantage before the Company will allow it  Greenhat  was going on in his Explanation when Sir  George England  thought fit to take up the Discourse in the fol∣lowing Manner  Gentlemen The Action you are in so great Doubt to approve of is greater than ever has been performed in any Age and the Value of it I ob∣serve from your Dissatisfaction For BattleCriticks are like all others you are the more of∣fended the more you ought to be and are con∣vinced you ought to be pleased Had this En∣gagement happened in the Time of the Old  Ro∣mans  and such Things been acted in their Ser∣vice there would not be a Foot of the Wood which was pierced but had been consecrated to some Deity or made memorable by the Death of him who expired in it for the Sake of his Coun∣try It had been said on some Monument at the Entrance Here the Duke of  Argyle  drew his Sword and said March Here  Webb  after ha∣ving an accomplish'd Fame for Gallantry expos'd himself like a common Soldier Here  Rivett  who was wounded at the Beginning of the Day and carried off as dead returned to the Field and received his Death Medals had been struck for our General's Behaviour when he first came into the Plain Here was the Fury of the Action and here the Hero stood as fearless as if invul∣nerable Such certainly had been the Cares of that State for their own Honour and in Grati∣tude to their Heroick Subjects But the Wood entrenched the Plain made more impassable than  the Wood and all the Difficulties opposed to the most gallant Army and most intrepid Leaders that ever the Sun shone upon are treated by the Talk of some in this Room as Objections to the Merit of our General and our Army But conti∣nued he I leave all the Examination of this Mat∣ter and a proper Discourse on our Sense of pub∣lick Actions to my Friend Mr  Bickerstaff  who may let Beaus and Gamesters rest till he has exa∣mined into the Reasons of Men's being Male∣contents in the only Nation that suffers profess'd Enemies to breath in open Air  From my own Apartment  Sept  The following Letters are sent to me from Re∣lations and tho' I do not know who and who are intended I publish them I have only writ Nonsence if there is nothing in them and done a good Action if they alarm any heedless Men against the Fraternity of the Knights whom the  Greeks  call    Mr  Bickerstaff  IT is taken very ill by several Gentlemen here that you are so little vigilant as to let the Dogs run from their Kennels to this Place Had you done your Duty we should have had No∣tice of their Arrival but the  Sharpers  are now become so formidable here that they have di∣vided themselves into Nobles and Commons Beau  Bogg  Beau  Pert Rake  and  Tallboy  are of their Upper House Broken Captains Igno∣rant Attorneys and such other Bankrupts from industrious Professions compose their Lower Order Among these Two Sets of Men there happened here lately some unhappy Differen∣ces 'Squire  Humphry  came down among us with Four Hundred Guinea's His raw Ap∣pearance and certain Signals in the goodna∣tured Muscles of  Humphry  's Countenance alarmed the Societies For  Sharpers  are as skil∣ful  as Beggars in Physiognomy and know as well where to hope for Plunder as the others to ask for Alms  Pert  was the Man exactly fit∣ted for taking with  Humphry  as a Fine Gentle∣man for a raw Fool is ever enamoured with his Contrary a Coxcomb and a Coxcomb is what the Booby who wants Experience and is unus'd to Company regards as the First of Men He ever looks at him with Envy and would certainly be such if he were not oppres∣sed by his Rusticity or Bashfulness There a∣rose an intire Friendship by this Sympathy be∣tween  Pert  and  Humphry  which ended in strip∣ping the latter We now could see this forlorn Youth for some Days Monyless without Sword and one Day without his Hat and with secret Melancholy pining for his Snuffbox the Jest of the whole Town but most of those who robb'd him  At last fresh Bills came down when imme∣diately their Countenances cleared up ancient Kindnesses and Familiarity renew'd and to Din∣ner he was invited by the Fraternity You are to know that while he was in his Days of Solitude a Commoner who was excluded from his Share of the Prey had whispered the 'Squire that he was bit and cautioned him of venturing again However Hopes of recovering his Snuffbox which was given him by his Aunt made him fall to play after Dinner yet mindful of what he was told he saw something that provoked him to tell 'em they were a Company of  Sharpers  Pre∣sently  Tallboy  sell on him and being too hard at Fiftycuffs drove him out of Doors The valiant  Pert  followed and kicked him in his Turn which the 'Squire resented as being nearer his Match so challenged him But dif∣fering about Time and Place Friends inter∣posed for he had still Money left and per∣swaded him to ask Pardon for provoking 'em  to beat him and they asked his for doing it The House consulting whence  Humphry  could have his Information concluded it must be from some malicious Commoner and to be re∣venged Beau  Bogg  watch'd their Haunts and in a Shop where some of them were at Play with Ladies shewed Dice which he found or pretended to find upon them and declaring how false they were warn'd the Company to take Care who they play'd with By his seem∣ing Candour he cleared his Reputation at least to Fools and some silly Women but it was still blasted by the 'Squire's Story with thinking Men However he gain'd a great Point by it for the next Day he got the Company shut up with himself and FellowMembers and robbed 'em at Discretion  I cannot express to you with what Indigna∣tion I behold the noble Spirit of Gentlemen de∣generated to that of private CutPurses 'Tis in vain to hope a Remedy while so many of the Fraternity get and enjoy Estates of Twenty Thirty and Fifty thousand Pounds with Im∣punity creep into the best Conversations and spread the infectious Villany through the Na∣tion while the lesser Rogues that rob for Hun∣ger or Nakedness are sacrificed by the Blind and in this Respect partial and defective Law Could you open Mens Eyes against the Occa∣sion of all this the great Corrupter of our Manners and Morality the Author of more Bankrupts than the War and sure Bane of all Industry Frugality and good Nature in a Word of all Virtues I mean publick or private Play at Cards or Dice How willingly would I contribute my utmost and possibly send you some Memoirs of the Lives and Politicks of some of the Fraternity of great Figure that might be of Use to you in setting this in a clear Light against next Session that all who  care for their Country or Posterity and see the pernicious Effects of such a publick Vice may endeavour its Destruction by some effectual Laws In Concurrence to this good Design I remain  Your Humble Servant  c  Bath  Aug  Friday Sept  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Heartily join with you in your laudable De∣sign against the  Mirmidons  as well as your late In inuations against  Coxcombs of Fire  and I take this Opportunity to congratulate you on the Success of your Labours which I obser∣ved Yesterday in one of the hottest  Firemen  in Town who not only affects a soft Smile but was seen to be Thrice contradicted without shewing any Sign of Impatience These I say so happy Beginnings promise fair and on this Account I rejoice you have undertaken to unkennel the Curs a Work of such Use that I admire it so long escaped your Vigilance and exhort you by the Concern you have for the good People of  England  to pursue your Design and that these Vermin may not flatter them∣selves that they pass undiscovered I desire you'd acquaint  Jack Haughty  that the whole Secret of his bubbling his Friend with the  Swiss  at the  Thatch'dHouse  is well known as also his sweetning the Knight and I shall acknowledge the Favour  Your most humble Servant  c  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Sept    Will's Coffeehouse  September  THE Subject of the Discourse this Evening was Eloquence and graceful Action  Lysan∣der  who is something particular in his Way of Thinking and Speaking told us a Man could not be Eloquent without Action For the Deportment of the Body the Turn of the Eye and an apt Sound to every Word that is utter'd must all conspire to make an accomplish'd Speaker Action in one that speaks in publick is the same Thing as a good Mien in ordinary Life Thus as a certain Insensibility in the Countenance re∣commends a Sentence of Humour and Jest so it must be a very lively Consciousness that gives Grace to great Sentiments The Jest is to be a Thing unexpected therefore your undesigning Manner is a Beauty in Expressions of Mirth but when you are to talk on a Set Subject the more you are moved your self the more you will move others  There is said he a remarkable Example of that Kind  Aeschines  a famous Orator of Antiquity had pleaded at  Athens  in a great Cause against  Demosthenes  but having lost it retired to  Rhodes  Eloquence was then the Quality most admired among Men and the Magistrates of that Place having heard he had a Copy of the Speech of  De∣mosthenes  desired him to repeat both their Plead∣ings After his own he recited also the Oration of his Antagonist The People expressed their Admi∣ration of both but more of that of  Demosthenes  If you are said he thus touched with hearing only  what that great Orator said How would you have been affected had you seen him speak For he who hears  Demosthenes  only loses much the better Part of the Oration Certain it is that they who speak gracefully are very lamely re∣presented in having their Speeches read or repeat∣ed by unskilful People for there is something native to each Man so inherent to his Thoughts and Sentiments which it is hardly possible for another to give a true Idea of You may observe in common Talk when a Sentence of any Mans is repeated an Acquaintance of his shall imme∣diately observe  That is so like him methinks I see how he look'd when he said it  But of all the People on the Earth there are none who puzzle me so much as the Clergy of  Great Britain  who are I believe the most lear∣ned Body of Men now in the World and yet this Art of Speaking with the proper Ornaments of Voice and Gesture is wholly neglected among them and I'll engage were a deaf Man to behold the greater Part of them preach he would rather think they were reading the Contents only of some Discourse they intended to make than actually in the Body of an Oration even when they are upon Matters of such a Nature as one would believe it were impossible to think of without Emotion  I own there are Exceptions to this general Observation and that the Dean we heard the other Day together is an Orator He has so much Regard to his Congregation that he com∣mits to his Memory what he is to say to them and has so soft and graceful a Behaviour that it must attract your Attention His Person it is to be confessed is no small Recommendation but he is to be highly commended for not losing that Advantage and adding to the Propriety of Speech which might pass the Criticism of  Longinus  an Action which would have been approved by  De∣mosthenes  He has a peculiar Force in his Way  and has many of his Audience who could not be intelligent Hearers of his Discourse were there not Explanation as well as Grace in his Action This Art of his is used with the most exact and honest Skill He never attempts your Passions 'till he has convinced your Reason All the Ob∣jections which he can form are laid open and dispersed before he uses the least Vehemence in his Sermon but when he thinks he has your Head he very soon wins your Heart and never pretends to show the Beauty of Holiness 'till he hath convinced you of the Truth of it  Would every one of our Clergymen be thus careful to recommend Truth and Virtue in their proper Figures and show so much Concern for them as to give them all the additional Force they were able it is not possible that Nonsence should have so many Hearers as you find it has in Dis∣senting Congregations for no Reason in the World but because it is spoken  Extempore  For ordinary Minds are wholly governed by their Eyes and Ears and there is no Way to come at their Hearts but by Power over their Imaginations  There is my Friend and merry Companion  Da∣niel  He knows a great deal better than he speaks and can form a proper Discourse as well as any Orthodox Neighbour But he knows very well that to bawl out My Beloved and the Words Grace Regeneration Sanctification A New Light The Day The Day Ay my Beloved the Day Or rather The Night The Night is coming And Judgment will come when we least think of it And so forthHe knows to be vehement is the only Way to come at his Audience  Daniel  when he sees my Friend  Greenhat  come in can give him a good Hint and cry out This is only for the Saints The Regenerated By this Force of Action though mixed with all the Incoherence and Ribaldry ima∣ginable  Daniel  can laugh at his Diocesan and  grow fat by voluntary Subscription while the Parson of the Parish goes to Law for half his Dues  Daniel  will tell you It is not the Shep∣herd but the Sheep with the Bell which the Flock follows  Another Thing very wonderful this learned Body should omit is Learning to read which is a most necessary Part of Eloquence in one who is to serve at the Altar For there is no Man but must be sensible that the lazy Tone and inarticulate Sound of our common Readers depreciates the most proper Form of Words that were ever extant in any Nation or Language to speak our own Wants or his Power from whom we ask Relief  There cannot be a greater Instance of the Power of Action than in little Parson  Dapper  who is the common Relief to all the lazy Pulpits in Town This smart Youth has a very good Memory a quick Eye and a clean Handkerchief Thus equip∣ped he opens his Text shuts his Book fairly shows he has no Notes in his Bible opens both Palms and shows all is fair there too Thus with a de∣cisive Air my young Man goes on without Hesi∣tation and though from the Beginning to the End of his pretty Discourse he has not used one proper Gesture yet at the Conclusion the Churchwarden pulls his Gloves from off his Head  Pray who is this extraordinary young Man  Thus the Force of Action is such that it is more prevalent even when improper than all the Rea∣son and Argument in the World without it This Gentleman concluded his Discourse by saying I do not doubt but if our Preachers would learn to speak and our Readers to read within Six Months Time we should not have a Dissenter within a Mile of a Church in  Great Britain  From my own Apartment  Sept  I have a Letter from a young Fellow who com∣plains to me that he was bred a Mercer and is now just out of his Time but unfortunately for  he has no Manner of Education suitable to his present Estate an Uncle has left him  l per Annum  The young Man is sensible that he is so spruce that he fears he shall never be genteel as long as he lives but applies himself to me to know what Method to take to help his Air and be a Fine Gentleman  He says  'That several of those Ladies who were formerly his Customers visit his Mother on Purpose to fall in his Way and fears he shall be obliged to marry against his Will for says he if any one of them should ask me I shall not be able to deny her I am says he further utterly at a Loss how to deal with them for though I was the most pert Creature in the World when I was Foreman and could hand a Woman of the First Quality to her Coach as well as her own Gentleman Usher I am now quite out of my Way and speechless in their Company They commend my Mode∣sty to my Face No one scruples to say I should certainly make the best Husband in the World a Man of my sober EducationMrs  Wou'dbe  watches all Opportunities to be alone with me Therefore good Mr  Bicker∣staff  here are my Writings enclosed if you can find any Flaw in my Title so as it may go to the next Heir who goes to St  James  's Cof∣feehouse and  White  's and could enjoy it I should be extremely well pleased with Two Thousand Pounds to set up my Trade and live in a Way I know I should become rather than be laugh'd at all my Life among too good Com∣pany If you could send for my Cousin and perswade him to take the Estate on these Terms and let no Body know it you would extremely oblige me'  Upon first Sight I thought this a very whimsical Proposal however upon more mature Conside∣ration I could not but admire the young Gentle∣man's Prudence and good Sense For there is no∣thing so irksome as living in a Way a Man knows he does not become I consulted Mr  Obadiah Greenhat  on this Occasion and he is so well plea∣sed with the Man that he has half a Mind to take the Estate himself but upon second Thoughts he proposed this Expedition I should be very willing said he to keep the Estate where it is if we could make the young Man any Way easy therefore I humbly propose he should take to Drinking for one HalfYear and make a Sloven of him and from thence begin his Education a∣new For it is a Maxim That one who is ill taught is in a worse Condition than he who is wholly ignorant therefore a spruce Mercer is farther off the Air of a Fine Gentleman than a downright Clown To make our Patient any Thing better we must unmake him what he is I indeed proposed to flux him but  Greenhat  an∣swer'd That if he recovered he'd be as prim and feat as ever he was Therefore he would have it his Way and our Friend is to drink till he is carbuncled and Tunbellied after which we will send him down to smoke and be buried with his Ancestors in  Derbyshire  I am indeed desirous he should have his Life in the Estate be∣cause he has such a just Sense of himself and his Abilities to know that it is an Unhappiness to him to be a Man of Fortune  This Youth seems to understand that a Gentle∣man's Life is that of all others the hardest to pass through with Propriety of Behaviour for though he has a Support without Art or Labour yet his Manner of enjoying that Circumstance is a Thing to be considered and you see among Men who are honoured with the common Appel∣lation of Gentlemen so many Contradictions to  that Character that it is the utmost ill Fortune to bear it For which Reason I am oblig'd to change the Circumstances of several about this Town  Harry Lacker  is so very exact in his Dress that I shall give his Estate to his younger Bro∣ther and make him a Dancing Master  Nokes Lightfoot  is so nimble and values himself so much upon it that I have Thoughts of making him Huntsman to a Pack of Beagles and give his Land to some Body that will stay upon it  Now I am upon the Topick of becoming what we enjoy I forbid all Persons who are not of the first Quality or who do not bear some important Office that requires so much Distinction to go to  HidePark  with Six Horses for I cannot but esteem it the highest Insolence Therefore here∣after no Man shall do it meerly because he is able without any other Pretension But what may serve all Purposes quite as well it shall be allowed all such who think Riches the chief Di∣stinction to appear in the Ring with Two Hor∣ses only and a RentRoll hanging out of each Side of their Coach This is a Thought of Mr  Greenhat  's who designs very soon to publish a sumptuary Discourse upon the Subject of Equi∣page wherein he will give us Rules on that Sub∣ject and assign the proper Duties and Qualifica∣tions of Masters and Servants as well as that of Husbands and Wives with a Treatise of Oeco∣nomy without Doors or the compleat Art of ap∣pearing in the World This will be very useful to all who are suddenly rich or are ashamed of being poor  Sunt certa Piacula quae te  Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare Libello  I have Notice of a new Pack of Dogs of quite another Sort than hitherto mention'd I have not an exact Account of their Way of Hunting  the following Letter giving only a bare Notice of them  September  SIR  THere are another Pack of Dogs to be disposed of who kennel about  CharingCross  at the old Fat Dog's at the Corner of  BuckinghamCourt  near  SpringGarden  Two of them are said to be whelped in  Alsatia  now in Ruins but they with the rest of the Pack are as pernicious as if the old Kennel had never been broken down The An∣cients distinguished this Sort of Curs by the Name of  Haeredipetes  the most pernicious of all Biters for seizing young Heirs especially when their Estates are entailed whom they reduce by one good Bite to such a Condition that they cannot ever after come to the Use of their Teeth or get smelling of a Crust You are desired to dispose of these as soon as you can that the Breed may not encrease and your Care in tying them up will be acknowledged by  SIR  Your Humble Servant  Philanthropos  St James's Coffeehouse  Sept  We have received Letters from the Duke of  Marlborough  's Camp which brings us further Par∣ticulars of the great and glorious Victory obtain'd over the Enemy on the th Instant  N S  The Number of the Wounded and Prisoners is much greater than was expected from our first Ac∣count The Day was doubtful till after Twelve of the Clock but the Enemy made little Resi∣stance after their first Line on the Left began to give Way An exact Narration of the whole Affair is expected next Post The  French  have had Two Days allowed them to bury their Dead and carry off their wounded Men upon Parole  Those Regiments of  Great Britain  which suffer'd most are order'd into Garrison and fresh Troops commanded to march into the Field The States have also directed Troops to march out of the Towns to relieve those who lost so many Men in attacking the Second Intrenchment of the  French  in the Plain between  Sart  and  Jansart  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Sept  to  Tuesd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  NO Man can conceive till he comes to try it how great a Pain it is to be a Publick∣spirited Person I am sure I am unable to express to the World what great Anxiety I have suffered to see of how little Benefit my Lucubrations have been to my FellowSubjects Men will go on in their own Way in Spight of all my Labour I gave Mr  Didapper  a private Reprimand for wear∣ing redheel'd Shoes and at the same Time was so indulgent as to connive at him for Fourteen Days because I would give him the wearing of them out but after all this I am informed he appeared Yesterday with a new Pain of the same Sort I have no better Success with Mr  Whatde'call  as to his Buttons  Stentor  still roars and Box and Dice rattle as loud as they did before I writ against them  Partridge  walks about at Noonday and  Aesculapius  thinks of ad∣ding a new Lace to his Lively However I must still go on in laying these Enormities before Men's Eyes and let them answer for going on in their Practice  My Province is much larger than at first Sight Men would imagine and I shall lose no Part of my Jurisdiction which extends not only to Futurity but also is retrospect to  Things past and the Behaviour of Persons who have long ago acted their Parts is as much liable to my Examination as that of my own Contem∣poraries  In order to put the whole Race of Mankind in their proper Distinctions according to the Opi∣nion their Cohabitants conceived of them I have with very much Care and Depth of Meditation thought fit to erect a Chamber of Fame and established certain Rules which are to be obser∣ved in admitting Members into this illustrious So∣ciety  In this Chamber of Fame there are to be Three Tables but of different Lengths the First is to contain exactly Twelve Persons the Second Twenty the Third an Hundred This is reckon∣ed to be the full Number of those who have any competent Share of Fame At the First of these Tables are to be placed in their Order the Twelve most famous Persons in the World not with Re∣gard to the Things they are famous for but ac∣cording to the Degree of their Fame whether in Valour Wit or Learning Thus if a Scholar be more famous than a Soldier he is to sit above him Neither must any Preference be given to Virtue if the Person be not equally famous  When the First Table is filled the next in Re∣nown must be seated at the Second and so on in like Manner to the Number of Twenty as also in the same Order at the Third which is to hold an Hundred At these Tables no Regard is to be had to Seniority For if  Julius Caesar  shall be judged more famous than  Romulus  and  Scipio  he must have the Precedence No Person who has not been dead an Hundred Years must be offered to a Place at any of these Tables And because this is altogether a LaySociety and that sacred Persons move upon greater Motives than that of Fame no Persons celebrated in holy Writ or any Eccle∣siastical Men whatsoever are to be introduced here  At the lower End of the Room is to be a SideTable for Persons of great Fame but dubious Existence such as  Hercules Theseus Aeneas A∣chilles Hector  and others But because it is ap∣prehended that there may be great Contention about Precedence the Proposer humbly desires the Opinion of the Learned towards his Assi∣stance in placing every Person according to his Rank that none may have just Occasion of Of∣fence  The Merits of the Cause shall be judged by Plurality of Voices  For the more impartial Execution of this im∣portant Affair it is desired That no Man will offer his Favourite Hero Scholar or Poet and that the Learned will be pleased to send to Mr  Bickerstaff  at Mr  Morphew  's near  StationersHall  their several Lists for the First Table only and in the Order they would have them placed after which the Composer will compare the seve∣ral Lists and make another for the Publick wherein every Name shall be ranked according to the Voices it has had Under this Chamber is to be a dark Vault for the same Number of Per∣sons of evil Fame  It is humbly submitted to Consideration Whe∣ther the Project would not be better if the Per∣sons of true Fame meet in a middle Room those of dubious Existence in an upper Room and those of evil Fame in a lower dark Room  It is to be noted That no Historians are to be admitted at any of these Tables because they are appointed to conduct the several Persons to their Seats and are to be made Use of as Ushers to the Assemblies  I call upon the learned World to send me their Assistance towards this Design it being a Matter of too great Moment for any one Person to de∣termine But I do assure them their Lists shall be examined with great Fidelity and those that  are exposed to the Publick made with all the Caution imaginable  In the mean Time while I wait for these Lists I am employ'd in keeping People in a right Way to avoid the contrary to Fame and Applause to wit Blame and Derision For this End I work upon that useful Project of the PennyPost by the Benefit of which it is proposed that a Chari∣table Society be established From which Society there shall go every Day Circular Letters to all Parts within the Bills of Mortality to tell People of their Faults in a friendly and private Manner whereby you may know what the World thinks of them before it is declared to the World that they are thus faulty This Me∣thod cannot fail of universal good Consequences For it is further added that they who will not be reformed by it must be contented to see the several Letters printed which were not regarded by them that when they will not take private Reprehension they may be tried further by a publick one I am very sorry I am obliged to print the following Epistles of that Kind to some Persons and the more because they are of the Fair Sex This went on  Friday  last to a very fine Lady  MADAM  I Am highly sensible that there is nothing of so tender a Nature as the Reputation and Conduct of Ladies and that when there is the least Stain got into their Fame it is hardly ever to be washed out When I have said this you will believe I am extremely concerned to hear at every Visit I make that your Manner of wearing your Hair is a meer Affectation of Beauty as well as that your Neglect of Pow∣der has been a common Evil to your Sex It is to you an Advantage to show that Abundance of fine Tresses But I beseech you to consider  that the Force of your Beauty and the Imita∣tion of you costs  Elconora  great Sums of Mo∣ney to her TireWoman for false Locks be∣sides what is allowed to her Maid for keeping the Secret that she is grey I must take Leave to add to this Admonition that you are not to reign above Four Months and odd Days longer Therefore I must desire you to raise and friz your Hair a little for it is downright Insolence to be thus handsome without Art and you'll forgive me for intreating you to do now out of Com∣passion what you must soon do out of Necessity I am  Madam  Your most Obedient and Most Humble Servant  This Person dresses just as she did before I writ As does also the Lady to whom I addressed the following Billet the same Day  MADAM  LET me beg of you to take off the Patches at the lower End of your Left Cheek and I will allow Two more under your Left Eye which will contribute more to the Sym∣metry of your Face except you would please to remove the Ten Black Atoms on your Lady∣ships Chin and wear one large Patch instead of them If so you may properly enough re∣tain the Three Patches abovementioned I am  c  This I thought had all the Civility and Rea∣son in the World in it but whether my Letters are intercepted or whatever it is the Lady patches as she used to do It is to be observed by all the charitable Society as an Instruction in their Epistles that they tell People of nothing  but what is in their Power to mend I shall give another Instance of this Way of Writing Two Sisters in  Essexstreet  are eternally gaping out of the Window as if they knew not the Va∣lue of Time or would call in Companions Upon which I writ the following Line  Dear Creatures  On the Receipt of this shut your Casements  But I went by Yesterday and found them still at the Window What can a Man do in this Case but go on and wrap himself up in his own Integrity with Satisfaction only in his me∣lancholy Truth that Virtue is its own Reward and that if no one is the better for his Admoni∣tions yet he is himself the more virtuous in that he gave those Advices  St James's Coffeehouse  Sept  Letters of the th Instant from the Duke of  Marlborough  's Camp at  Havre  advise That the necessary Dispositions were made for opening the Trenches before  Mons  The Direction of the Siege is to be committed to the Prince of  Orange  who designed to take his Post accordingly with Battalions and Squadrons on the Day fol∣lowing On the th LieutenantGeneral  Cado∣gan  set out for  Brussels  to hasten the Ammuni∣tion and Artillery which is to be employed in this Enterprize and the Confederate Army was extended from the  Haisne  to the  Trouille  in order to cover the Siege The Loss of the Confederates in the late Battle is not exactly known but it ap∣pears by a List transmitted to the StatesGene∣ral that the Number of the Killed and Wound∣ed in their Service amounts to above Eight thou∣sand It is computed that the  English  have lost Men and the rest of the Allies about Five thousand including the Wounded The StatesGeneral have taken the most speedy and effectual  Measures for reinforcing their Troops and 'tis expected that in Eight or Ten Days the Army will be as numerous as before the Battle The Affairs in  Italy  afford us nothing remarkable on∣ly that it is hoped the Difference between the Courts of  Vienna  and  Turin  will be speedily ac∣commodated Letters from  Poland  present us with a near Prospect of seeing King  Augustus  re∣established on the Throne all Parties being very industrious to reconcile themselves to his Inte∣rests  Will's Coffeehouse  September  Of all the pretty Arts in which our modern Writers excel there is not any which is more to be recommended to the Imitation of Beginners than the Skill of Transition from one Subject to another I know not whether I make my self well understood but it is certain that the Way of stringing a Discourse used in the  Mercury Gal∣lant  the  Gentleman  's  Journal  and other learned Writings not to mention how naturally Things present themselves to such as harangue in Pulpits and other Occasions which occur to the Learned are Methods worthy Commendation I shall at∣tempt this Style my self in a few Lines Suppose I were discoursing upon the King of  Sweden  's passing the  Boristhenes  The  Boristhenes  is a great River and puts me in Mind of the  Danube  and the  Rhine  The  Danube  I cannot think of with∣out reflecting on that unhappy Prince who had such fair Territories on the Banks of it I mean the Duke of  Bavaria  who by our last Letters is retired from  Mons Mons  is as strong a Fortifica∣tion as any which has no Citadel And Places which are not compleatly fortified are me∣thinks Lessons to Princes that they are not Om∣nipotent but liable to the Strokes of Fortune But as all Princes are subject to such Calamities it is the Part of Men of Letters to guard them from the Observations of all small Writers For  which Reason I shall conclude my present Re∣marks by publishing the following Advertise∣ment to be taken Notice of by all who dwell in the Suburbs of Learning  Whereas the King of  Sweden  has been so unfortu∣nate to receive a Wound in his Heel we do hereby prohibit all Epigrammatists in either Language and both Universities as well as all other Poets of what Denomination soever to make any Mention of  Achil∣les  having received his Death's Wound in the same Part  We do likewise forbid all Comparisons in Coffeehouses between  Alexander the Great  and the said King of  Sweden  and from making any Parallels between the Death of  Patkul  and  Philotas  we be∣ing very apprehensive of the Reflections that several Politicians have ready by them to produce on this Occasion and being willing as much as in us lies to free the Town from all Impertinencies of this Nature  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Sept  to  Thursd Sept    From my own Apartment  Sept  THE Progress of our Endeavours will of Ne∣cessity be very much interrupted except the learned World will please to send their Lists to the Chamber of Fame with all Expedition There is nothing can so much contribute to create a noble Emulation in our Youth as the honou∣rable Mention of such whose Actions have out∣lived the Injuries of Time and recommended themselves so far to the World that it is become Learning to know the least Circumstance of their  Affairs It is a great Incentive to see that some Men have raised themselves so highly above their Fellow Creatures that the Lives of ordinary Men are spent in Inquiries after the particular Actions of the most Illustrious True it is that without this Impulse to Fame and Reputation our Industry would stagnate and that lively Desire of pleasing each other die away This Opinion was so establish'd in the Heathen World that their Sense of Living appeared insipid except their Being was enlivened with a Consciousness that they were esteemed by the rest of the World  Upon examining the Proportion of Men's Fame for my Table of Twelve I thought it no ill Way since I had laid it down for a Rule That they were to be ranked simply as they were fa∣mous without Regard to their Virtue to ask my Sister  Jenny  's Advice and particularly mentioned to her the Name of  Aristotle  She immediately told me he was a very great Scholar and that she had read him at the BoardingSchool She cer∣tainly means a Trifle sold by the Hawkers cal∣led  Aristotle  's  Problems  But this raised a great Scruple in me Whether a Fame increased by Im∣position of others is to be added to his Account or that these Excrescencies which grow out of his real Reputation and give Encouragement to others to pass Things under the Covert of his Name should be considered in giving him his Seat in the Chamber This Punctilio is referred to the Learned In the mean Time so illna∣tured are Mankind that I believe I have Names already sent me sufficient to fill up my Lists for the dark Room and every one is apt enough to send in their Accounts of ill Defervers This Malevolence does not proceed from a real Dislike of Virtue but a diabolical Prejudice against it which makes Men willing to destroy what they care not to imitate Thus you see the greatest Characters among your Acquaintance and those  you live with are traduced by all below them in Virtue who never mention them but with an Ex∣ception However I believe I shall not give the World much Trouble about filling my Tables for those of evil Fame for I have some Thoughts of clapping up the  Sharpers  there as fast as I can lay hold of them  At present I am employed in looking over the several Notices which I have received of their Manner of Dexterity and the Way at Dice of making all Rugg as the Cant is The whole Art of securing a Die has lately been sent me by a Per∣son who was of the Fraternity but is disabled by the Loss of a Finger by which Means he cannot practise that Trick as he used to do But I am very much at a Loss how to call some of the Fair Sex who are Accomplices with the  Knights of In∣dustry  for my Metaphorical Dogs are easily enough understood but the Feminine Gender of Dogs has so harsh a Sound that we know not how to name it But I am credibly informed that there are Fe∣male Dogs as voracious as the Males and make Advances to young Fellows without any other Design but coming to a Familiarity with their Purses I have also long Lists of Persons of Con∣dition who are certainly of the same Regimen with these  Banditti  and instrumental to their Cheats upon undiscerning Men of their own Rank These add their good Reputation to carry on the Impostures of others whose very Names would else be Defence enough against falling into their Hands But for the Honour of our Nation these shall be unmention'd provided we hear no more of such Practices and that they shall not from henceforward suffer the Society of such as they know to be the common Enemies of Order Dis∣cipline and Virtue If it appear that they go on in encouraging them they must be proceeded against according to severest Rules of History where all is to be laid before the World  with Impartiality and without Respect to Per∣sons  So let the stricken Deer go weep  Will's Coffeehouse  Sept  I find left here for me the following Epistle  SIR  HAving lately read your Discourse about the Fa∣mily of  Trubies  wherein you observe that there are some who fall into Laughter out of a cer∣tain Benevolence in their Temper and not out of the ordinary Motive  viz  Contempt and Triumph over the Imperfections of others I have conceived a good Idea of your Knowledge of Mankind And as you have a Tragicomick Genius I beg the Favour of you to give us your Thoughts of a quite different Effect which also is caused by other Motives than what are commonly taken Notice of What I would have you treat of is the Cause of shed∣ding Tears I desire you would discuss it a little with Observations upon the various Occasions which provoke us to that Expression of our Con∣cern  c  To obey this complaisant Gentleman I know no Way so short as examining the various Touches of my own Bosom on several Occurrences in a long Life in the Evening of which I am ar∣rived after as many various Incidents as any Body has met with I have often reflected that the e is a great Similitude in the Motions of the Heart in Mirth and in Sorrow and I think the usual Occasion of the latter as well as the for∣mer is something which is sudden and unexpect∣ed The Mind has not a sufficient Time to recol∣lect its Force and immediately gushes into Tears before we can utter our selves by Speech or Com∣plaint The most notorious Causes of these Drops from our Eyes are Pity Sorrow Joy and Reconciliation  The Fair Sex who are made of Man and not of Earth have a more delicate Humanity than we have and Pity is the most common Cause of their Tears For as we are inwardly composed of an Aptitude to every Circumstance of Life and every Thing that befalls any one Person might have happened to any other of humane Race Selflove and a Sense of the Pain we our selves should suffer in the Circumstances of any whom we pity is the Cause of that Compassion Such a Reflection in the Breast of a Woman imme∣diately inclines her to Tears but in a Man it makes him think how such a one ought to act on that Occasion suitably to the Dignity of his Nature Thus a Woman is ever moved for those whom she hears lament and a Man for those whom he observes to suffer in Silence It is a Man's own Behaviour in the Circumstances he is under which procures him the Esteem of others and not meerly the Affliction it self which de∣mands our Pity For we never give a Man that Passion which he falls into for himself He that commends himself never purchases our Applause nor he who bewails himself our Pity  Going through an Alley the other Day I ob∣served a noisy impudent Beggar bawl out That he was wounded in a Merchantman That he had lost his poor Limbs and showed a Leg clouted up All that passed by made what haste they could out of his Sight and Hearing but a Poor Fellow at the End of the Passage with a rusty Coat a melancholy Air and a soft Voice desired them to look upon a Man not used to beg The latter received the Charity of almost every one that went by The Strings of the Heart which are to be touched to give us Compassion are not so played on but by the finest Hand We see in Tragical Representations it is not the Pomp of Language or Magnificence of Dress in which the  Passion is wrought that touches sensible Spirits but something of a plain and simple Nature which breaks in upon our Souls by that Sympathy which is given us for our mutual Goodwill and Service  In the Tragedy of  Mackbeth  where  Wilks  acts the Part of a Man whose Family has been mur∣dered in his Absence the Wildness of his Passion which is run over in a Torrent of calamitous Circumstances does but raise my Spirits and give me the Alarm but when he skilfully seems to be out of Breath and is brought too low to say more and upon a second Reflection cry only wiping his Eyes  What both Children Both both my Children gone  There is no resisting a Sor∣row which seems to have cast about for all the Reasons possible for its Consolation but has no Recourse  There is not one left but both both are murdered  Such sudden Starts from the Thread of the Discourse and a plain Sentiment expressed in an artless Way are the irresistible Strokes of Eloquence and Poetry The same great Master  Shakespear  can afford us Instances of all the Places where our Souls are accessible and ever commands our Tears But it is to be observed that he draws them from some unex∣pected Source which seems not wholly of a Piece with the Discourse Thus when  Brutus  and  Cassius  had a Debate in the Tragedy of  Caesar  and rose to warm Language against each other insomuch that it had almost come to something that might be fatal till they recollected them∣selves  Brutus  does more than make an Apology for the Heat he had been in by saying  Porcia is dead  Here  Cassius  is all Tenderness and ready to dissolve when he considers that the Mind of his Friend had been employed on the greatest Affliction imaginable when he had been adding to it by a Debate on Trifles which makes him in the Anguish of his Heart cry out  How scaped I killing when I thus provoked you  This is an Incident which moves the Soul in all its Sentiments and  Cassius  's Heart was at once touched with all the soft Pangs of Pity Remorse and Reconciliation It is said indeed by  Horace If you would have me weep you must first weep your self  This is not literally true for it would have been as rightly said if we observe Nature That I shall certainly weep if you do not But what is intended by that Expression is That it is not possible to give Passion except you show that you suffer your self Therefore the true Art seems to be that when you would have the Per∣son you represent pitied you must show him at once in the highest Grief and Struggling to bear it with Decency and Patience In this Case we sigh for him and give him every Groan he suppresses  I remember when I was young enough to follow the Sports of the Field I have more than once rode off at the Death of a Deer when I have seen the Animal in an Affliction which ap∣peared humane without the least Noise let fall Tears when he was reduced to Extremity and I have thought of the Sorrow I saw him in when his Haunch came to the Table But our Tears are not given only to Objects of Pity but the Mind has Recourse to that Relief in all Oc∣casions which give us much Emotion Thus to be apt to shed Tears is a Sign of a great as well as little Spirit I have heard say the pre∣sent Pope never passes through the People who always kneel in Crowds and ask his Benediction but the Tears are seen to flow from his Eyes This must proceed from an Imagination that he is the Father of all those People and that he is touched with so extensive a Benevolence that it breaks out into a Passion of Tears You see Friends who have been long absent transported in the same Manner A Thousand little Images crowd upon them at their Meeting as all the Joys and Griefs they have known during their  Separation and in one Hurry of Thought they conceive how they should have participated in those Occasions and weep because their Minds are too full to wait the slow Expression of Words  His Lacrymis Vitam damus miscrescimus ultro  There is lately broke loose from the  London  Pack a very tall dangerous Biter He is now at the  Bath  and it is feared will make a damnable Havock a∣mongst the Game His Manner of Biting is new and he is called the  Top  He secures one Die be∣twixt his Two Fingers The other is fixed by the Help of a famous Wax invented by an Apothecary since a Gamester a little of which he puts upon his Forefinger and that holds the Die in the Box at his Devotion Great Sums have been lately won by these Ways but 'tis hoped that this Hint of his Manner of Cheating will open the Eyes of many who are every Day imposed upon  There is now in the Press and will be suddenly publish'd a Book entituled  An Appendix to the Contempt of the Clergy  wherein will be set forth at large That all our Dissentions are owing to the Laziness of Persons in the sacred Ministry and that none of the present Schisms could have crept into the Flock but by the Negligence of the Pastors There is a Digression in this Treatise proving That the Pretences made by the Priesthood from Time to Time that the Church was in Danger is only a Trick to make the Laity passionate for that of which they themselves have been negligent The whole concludes with an Exhortation to the Clergy to the Study of Eloquence and Practice of Piety as the only Method to support the highest of all Honours that of a Priest who lives and acts according to his Character  The TATLER N  o    Quid oportet  Nos facere a vulgo longe latèque remotos  From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Sept    From my own Apartment  September  IT is as far as it relates to our present Being the great End of Education to raise our selves above the Vulgar but what is intended by the Vulgar is not methinks enough understood In me indeed that Word raises a quite different Idea from what it usually does in others but perhaps that proceeds from my being old and beginning to want the Relish of such Satisfactions as are the ordinary Entertainment of Men How∣ever such as my Opinion is in this Case I will speak it because it is possible that Turn of Thought may be received by others who may reap as much Satisfaction from it as I do my self  It is to me a very great Meanness and some∣thing much below a Philosopher which is what I mean by a Gentleman to rank a Man among the Vulgar for the Condition of Life he is in and not according to his Behaviour his Thoughts and Sentiments in that Condition For if a Man be loaded with Riches and Honours and in that State of Life has Thoughts and Inclinations be∣low the meanest Artificer is not such an Artifi∣cer who within his Power is good to his Friends moderate in his Demands for his Labour and chearful in his Occupation very much superior to him who lives for no other End but to serve himself and assumes a Preference in all his Words and Actions to those who act their Part with  much more Grace than himself  Epictetus  has made use of the Similitude of a StagePlay to hu∣mane Life with much Spirit It is not says he to be considered among the Actors who is Prince or who is Beggar but who acts Prince or Beg∣gar best The Circumstance of Life should not be that which gives us Place but our Behaviour in that Circumstance is what should be our solid Distinction Thus a wise Man should think no Man above him or below him any further than it regards the outward Order and Discipline of the World For if we take too great an Idea of the Eminence of our Superiors or Subordina∣tion of our Inferiors it will have an ill Effect up on our Behaviour to both He who thinks no Man above him but for his Virtue none below him but for his Vice can never be obsequious or assuming in a wrong Place but will frequently emulate Men in Rank below him and pity those above him  This Sense of Mankind is so far from a levelling Principle that it only sets us upon a true Basis of Distinction and doubles the Merit of such as be∣come their Condition A Man in Power who can without the ordinary Prepossessions which stop the Way to the true knowledge and Service of Mankind overlook the little Distinctions of Fortune raise obscure Merit and discountenance successful Indesert has in the Minds of knowing Men the Figure of an Angel rather than a Man and is above the rest of Men in the highest Cha∣racter he can be even that of their Benefactor  Turning my Thoughts as I was taking my Pipe this Evening after this Manner it was no small Delight to me to receive Advice from  Felicia  That  Eboracensis  was appointed a Governour of one of their Plantations As I am a great Lover of Man∣kind I took Part in the Happiness of that People who were to be governed by one of so great Hu∣manity Justice and Honour  Eboracensis  has read  all the Schemes which Writers have formed of Government and Order and been long conver∣sant with Men who have the Reins in their Hands so that he can very well distinguish be∣tween Chimaerical and Practical Politicks It is a great Blessing when Men have to deal with such different Characters in the same Species as those of FreeMen and Slaves that they who command have a just Sense of humane Nature it self by which they can temper the Haughtiness of the Master and soften the Servitude of the Slave  Hae tibi erunt Artes  This is the Notion with which those of the Plantation receive  Ebo∣racensis  And as I have cast his Nativity I find it will be a Record made of this Person's Ad∣ministration and on that Part of the Shore from whence he embarks to return from his Government there will be a Moument with these Words  Here the People wept and took Leave of  Eboracensis  the first Governour our Mo∣ther  Felicia  sent who during his Command here believed himself her Subject  White's Chocolatehouse  Sept  The following Letter wants such sudden Dis∣patch that all Things else must wait for this Time  Sept Equal Day and Night  SIR  THere are Two Ladies who having a good Opinion of your Tast and Judgment desire you to make Use of them in the following Par∣ticular which perhaps you may allow very ex∣traordinary The Two Ladies before mention'd have a considerable Time since contracted a more sincere and constant Friendship than their Adversaries the Men will allow consistent with the Frailty of Female Nature and being from a long Acquaintance convinced of the perfect Agreement of their Tempers have thought up∣on an Expedient to prevent their Separation  and cannot think any so effectual since 'tis common for Love to destroy Friendship as to give up both their Liberties to the same Person in Marriage The Gentleman they have pitch'd upon is neither wellbred nor agreeable his Understanding moderate and his Person never designed to charm Women but having so much SelfInterest in his Nature as to be satisfied with making double Contracts upon Condition of receiving double Fortunes and most Men being so far sensible of the Uneasiness that one Woman occasions they think him for these Reasons the most likely Person of their Ac∣quaintance to receive these Proposals Upon all other Accounts he is the last Man either of them would chuse yet for this preferable to all the rest They desire to know your Opinion the next Post resolving to defer far∣ther Proceeding till they have received it I am  SIR  Your Unknown Unthoughtof Humble Servant  Bridget Eitherside  This is very extraordinary and much might be objected by me who am something of a Ci∣vilian to the Case of Two marrying the same Man but these Ladies are I perceive FreeThinkers and therefore I shall speak only to the prudential Part of this Design meerly as a Phi∣losopher without entring into the Merit of it in the Ecclesiastical or Civil Law These constant Friends  Piledea  and  Orestea  are at a Loss to preserve their Friendship from the Encroach∣ments of Love for which End they have resolved upon a Fellow who cannot be the Object of Af∣fection  or Esteem to either and consequently cannot rob one of the Place each has in her Friend's Heart But in all my Reading and I have read all that the Sages in Love have writ I have found the greatest Danger in Jealousy The Ladies indeed to avoid this Passion chuse a sad Fellow but if they would be advised by me they had better have each their worthless Man otherwise he that was despicable while he was indifferent to them will become valuable when he seems to prefer one to the other  I remember in the History of Don  Quixot  of the  Manca  there is a memorable Passage which opens to us the Weakness of our Nature in such Particu∣lars The Don falls into Discourse with a Gen∣tleman whom he calls the Knight of the  GreenCas∣sock  and is invited to his House When he comes there he runs into Discourse and Panegyrick up∣on the Oeconomy the Government and Order of his Family the Education of his Children and lastly on the singular Wisdom of him who disposed Things with that Exactness The Gen∣tleman makes a Soliloquy to himself Oh irresi∣stible Power of Flattery 'Though I know this is a Madman I cannot help being taken with his Applause The Ladies will find this much more true in the Case of their Lover and the Woman be most likes will certainly be more pleased she whom he slights more offended than she can imagine before she has tried Now I humbly propose That they both marry Cox∣combs whom they are sure they cannot like and then they may be pretty secure against the Change of Affection which they fear and by that Means preserving the Temperature under which they now write enjoy during Life  Equal Day and Night  St James's Coffeehouse  September  There is no Manner of News but People now spend their Time in Coffeehouses in Reflections  upon the Particulars of the late glorious Day and collecting the several Parts of the Action as they are produced in Letters from private Hands or Notice given to us by Accounts in publick Pa∣pers A pleasant Gentleman alluding to the great Fences through which we pierced said this Evening The  French  thought themselves on the right Side of the Hedge but it proved other∣wise Mr  Kidney  who has long conversed with and filled Tea for the most consummate Politi∣cians was pleased to give me an Account of this Piece of Ribaldry and desired me on that Occa∣sion to write a whole Paper on the Subject of Valour and explain how that Quality which must be possessed by whole Armies is so highly preferable in one Man rather than another and how the same Actions are but meer Acts of Duty in some and Instances of the most Heroick Virtue in others He advised me not to fail in this Dis∣course to mention the Gallantry of the Prince of  Nassau  in this last Engagement who when a Battalion made an Halt in the Face of the Enemy snatched the Colours out of the Hands of the En∣sign and planted them just before the Line of the Enemy calling to that Battalion to take Care of their Colours if they had no Regard to him Mr  Kidney  has my Promise to obey him in this Particular on the first Occasion that offers  Mr  Bickerstaff  is now compiling exact Accounts of the Pay of the Militia and the CommissionOfficers under the respective Lieutenancies of  Great Britain  In the first Place of those of  London  and  Westminster  and in Regard that there are no common Soldiers but all Housekeepers or Represen∣tatives of House keepers in these Bodies the Sums raised by the Officers shall be looked into and their FellowSoldiers or rather FellowTravellers from one Part of the Town to the other not defrauded of the Ten Pounds allowed for the Subsistence of the Troops  Whereas not very long since at a Tavern between  FleetBridge  and  CharingCross  some certain polite Gentlemen thought fit to perform the  Bacchanalian  Exercises of Devotion by dancing without Clothes on after the Manner of the  PraeAdamites  This is to certify those Persons That there is no Manner of Wit or Humour in the said Practice and that the Beadles of the Parish are to be at the next Meeting where it is to be examined Whether they are arrived at Want of Feeling as well as Want of Shame  Whereas a ChappelClerk was lately taken in a Garret on a FlockBed with Two of the Fair Sex who are usually employed in sifting Cinders This is to let him know That if he persists in being a Scan∣dal both to Laity and Clergy as being as it were both and neither the Names of the Nymphs who were with him shall be printed therefore he is de∣sired as he tenders the Reputation of his Ladies to repent  Mr  Bickerstaff  has received Information That an eminent and noble Preacher in the chief Congre∣gation of  Great Britain  for Fear of being thought guilty of Presbyterian Fervency and Extemporary Prayer lately read his before Sermon but the same Advices acknowledging that he made the Congregation large Amends by the Shortness of his Discourse it is thought fit to make no further Observation upon it  The TATLER N  o    Quicquid agunt Homines nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Saturday Sept  to  Tuesd Sept    From my own Apartment  September  THE following Letter in Prosecution of what I have lately asserted has urged that Mat∣ter so much better than I had that I insert it as  I received it These Testimonials are customary with us learned Men and sometimes are suspe∣cted to be written by the Author but I fear no one will suspect me of this  London  Sept  SIR  HAving read your Lucubrations of the th Instant I can't but entirely agree with you in your Notions of the Scarcity of Men who can either read or speak For my Part I have lived these Years in the World and yet have ob∣served but a very few who could do either in any tolerable Manner among which few you must understand that I reckon my self How far Eloquence set off with the proper Orna∣ments of Voice and Gesture will prevail over the Passions and how cold and unaffecting the best Oration in the World would be without them there are Two remarkable Instances in the Case of  Ligarius  and that of  Milo Caesar  had condemned  Ligarius  He came indeed to hear what might be said but thinking himself his own Master resolved not to be byassed by any Thing  Cicero  could say in his Behalf But in this he was mistaken for when the Orator began to speak the Hero is moved he is van∣quish'd and at length the Criminal absolved It must be observed that this famous Orator was less renown'd for his Courage than his Eloquence for though he came at another Time prepared to defend  Milo  with one of the best Orations that Antiquity has produced yet being seized with a sudden Fear by seeing some armed Men surrounding the  Forum  he falter'd in his Speech and became unable to exert that irresistible Force and Beauty of Action which would have saved his Client and for Want of which he was con∣demned to Banishment As the Success the for∣mer of these Orations met with appears chief∣ly owing to the Life and graceful Manner with  which it was recited for some there are who think it may be read without Transport so the latter seems to have failed of Success for no other Reason but because the Orator was not in a Condition to set it off with those Orna∣ments It must be confessed that artful Sound will with the Crowd prevail even more than Sense but those who are Masters of both will ever gain the Admiration of all their Hearers And there is I think a very natural Account to be given of this Matter for the Sensation of the Head and Heart are caused in each of these Parts by the outward Organs of the Eye and Ear That therefore which is conveyed to the Understanding and Passions by only one of these Organs will not affect us so much as that which is transmitted through both I can't but think your Charge is just against a great Part of the learned Clergy of  Great Britain  who de∣liver the most excellent Discourses with such Coldness and Indifference that 'tis no great Wonder the unintelligent Many of their Con∣gregations fall asleep Thus it happens that their Orations meet with a quite contrary Fate to that of  Demesthenes  you mentioned for as that lost much of its Beauty and Force by be∣ing repeated to the Magistrates of  Rhodes  with∣out the winning Action of that great Orator so the Performances of these Gentlemen never appear with so little Grace and to so much Dis∣advantage as when delivered by themselves from the Pulpit  Hippocrates  being sent for to a Patient in this City and having felt his Pulse enquired into the Symptoms of his Distemper and finding that it proceeded in a great Measure from Want of Sleep advises his Patient with an Air of Gravity to be carried to Church to hear a Sermon not doubting but that it would dispose him for the Rest he wanted If some of the Rules  Horace  gives for the Theatre  were not improperly applied to our Pulpits we should not hear a Sermon prescribed as a good Opiate  Si vis me flere dolendum est  Primum ipsi tibi  A Man must himself express some Concern and Affection in delivering his Discourse if he expects his Auditory should interest themselves in what he proposes For otherwise notwith∣standing the Dignity and Importance of the Sub∣ject he treats of notwithstanding the Weight and Argument of the Discourse it self yet too many will say  Male si Mandata loqueris  Aut dormitabo aut ridebo  If there be a Deficiency in the Speaker there will not be a sufficient Attention and Regard paid to the Things spoken But Mr  Bickerstaff  you know that as too little Action is cold so too much is fulsome Some indeed may think themselves accomplished Speakers for no other Reason than because they can be loud and noisy for surely  Stentor  must have some Design in his Vociferations But dear Mr  Bicker∣staff  convince them that as harsh and irregu∣lar Sound is not Harmony so neither is bang∣ing a Cushion Oratory And therefore in my humble Opinion a certain Divine of the First Order whom I allow otherwise to be a great Man would do well to leave this off for I think his Sermons would be more perswa∣sive if he gave his Auditory less Disturbance Though I cannot say that this Action would be wholly improper to a prophane Oration yet I think in a Religious Assembly it gives a Man too Warlike or perhaps too Theatrical  a Figure to be suitable to a Christian Congre∣gation I am  SIR  Your humble Servant  c  The most learned and ingenious Mr  Roschat  is also pleased to write to me on this Subject  SIR  I Read with great Pleasure in the  Tatler  of  Saturday  last the Conversation upon Elo∣quence permit me to hint to you one Thing the great  Roman  Orator observes upon this Sub∣ject  Caput enim arbitrabatur Oratoris  he quotes  Menedemus  an  Athenian    ut ipsis apud quos ageret talis qualem ipse optaret videretur id fieri Vitae Dignitate  It is the first Rule in Oratory That a Man must appear such as he would per∣swade others to be and that can be accomplish'd only by the Force of his Life I believe it might be of great Service to let our publick Orators know That an unnatural Gravity or an unbe∣coming Levity in their Behaviour out of the Pulpit will take very much from the Force of then Eloquence in it Excuse another Scrap of  Latin  'tis from one of the Fathers I think it will appear a just Observation to all as it may have Authority with some  Qui autem do∣cent tantum nec faciunt ipsi Praeceptis suis detra∣hunt Pondus Quis enim obtemperet cum ipsi Praeceptores doceant non obtemperare  I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Jonathan Roschat  P S  You were complaining in that Paper That the Clergy of  Great Britain  had not yet learned to speak A very great Defect indeed and therefore I shall think my self a WellDe∣server  of the Church in recommending all the dumb Clergy to the famous speaking Doctor at  Kensington  This ingenious Gentleman out of Compassion to those of a bad Utterance has pla∣ced his whole Study in the new modelling the Organs of Voice which Art he has so far advan∣ced as to be able even to make a good Orator of a Pair of Bellows He lately exhibited a Spe∣cimen of his Skill in this Way of which I was informed by the worthy Gentlemen then present who were at once delighted and amazed to hear an Instrument of so simple an Organisation use an exact Articulation of Words a just Cadency in its Sentences and a wonderful  Pathos  in its Pronunciation not that he designs to expatiate in this Practice because he cannot as he says apprehend what Use it may be of to Mankind whose Benefit he aims at in a more particular Manner And for the same Reason he will ne∣ver more instruct the Feather'd Kind the Parrat having been his last Scholar in that Way He has a wonderful Faculty in making and mending Ec∣choes and this he will perform at any Time for the Use of the Solitary in the Country being a Man born for universal Good and for that Reason recommended to your Patronage by  Sir  Yours  c  Another learned Gentleman gives me also this Encomium  SIR  September  YOU are now got into an useful and noble Subject take Care to handle it with Judg∣ment and Delicacy I wish every young Di∣vine would give yours of  Saturday  last a serious Perusal and now you are entered upon the Action of an Orator if you would proceed to fa∣vour the World with some Remarks on the  mystical Enchantments of Pronunciation what a secret Force there is in the Accents of a tuna∣ble Voice and wherefore the Works of Two very great Men of the Profession could never please so well when read as heard I shall trouble you with no more Scribble You are now in the Method of being truly profitable and delight∣ful If you can keep up to such great and su∣blime Subjects and pursue them with a suitable Genius go on and prosper  Farewel  White's Chocolatehouse  September  This was left for me here for the Use of the Company of the House  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Sept  SIR  THE Account you gave lately of a certain Dogkennel in or near  Suffolk street  was not so punctual as to the List of the Dogs as might have been expected from a Person of Mr  Bicker∣staff  's Intelligence for if you'll dispatch  Pacolet  thither some Evening 'tis Ten to One but he finds besides those you mentioned  Towzer  a large  French  Mongrel that was not long ago in a tatter'd Condition but has now got new Hair is not fleet but when he grap∣ples bites even to the Marrow  Spring  a little  French  Greyhound that lately made a false Trip to  Tunbridge  Sly  an old battered Foxhound that began the Game in  France  Lightfoot  a fine skinned  Flanders  Dog that belong'd to a Pack at  Ghent  but having lost Flesh is come to  Paris  for the Benefit of the Air  With several others that in Time may be worth Notice  Your Familiar will see also how anxious the Keepers are about the Prey and indeed not without very good Reason for they have their Share of every Thing nay not so much as a poor Rabbet can be run down but these carni∣vorous Curs swallow a Quarter of it Some Me∣chanicks in the Neighbourhood that have en∣ter'd into this civil Society and who furnish Part of the Carrion and Oatmeal for the Dogs have the Skin and the Bones are pick'd clean by a little  French  Shock that belongs to the Fa∣mily  c  I am  SIR  Your humble Servant  c  I had almost forgot to tell you That  Ring∣wood  bites at  Hampstead  with false Teeth  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Sept  to  Thursday Sept    From my own Apartment  September  I Have long been against my Inclination em∣ployed in Satyr and that in Prosecution of such Persons who are below the Dignity of the true Spirit of it such who I fear are not to be reclaimed by making them only ridiculous The  Sharpers  therefore shall have a Month's Time to themselves free from the Observation of this Pa∣per but I must not make a Truce without let∣ting 'em know that at the same Time I am pre∣paring for a more vigorous War for a Friend of mine has promised me he will employ his Time in compiling such a Tract before the Ses∣sion of the ensuing Parliament as shall lay Gaming home to the Bosoms of all who love their Country or their Families and he doubts  not but it will create an Act that shall make these Rogues as scandalous as those less mischie∣vous Ones on the high Road  I have received private Intimations to take Care of my Walks and remember there are such Things as Stabs and Blows But as there never was any Thing in this Design which ought to displease a Man of Honour or which was not design'd to offend the Rascals I shall give my self very little Concern for finding what I expected that they would be highly provoked at these Lucubrations But tho' I utterly despise the Pack I must confess I am at a Stand at the Receipt of the following Letter which seems to be written by a Man of Sense and Worth who has mistaken some Passage that I am sure was not levelled at him This Gen∣tleman's Complaints give me Compunction when I neglect the Threats of the Rescals I can't be in Jest with the Rogues any longer since they pretend to threaten I don't know whether I shall allow 'em the Favour of Transportation  Sept  Mr  Bickerstaff  OBserving you are not content with lashing the many Vices of the Age without illustrating each with particular Characters it's thought no∣thing would more contribute to the Impression you design by such than always having regard to Truth In your  Tatler  of this Day I observe you allow That nothing is so tender as a Lady's Repu∣tation that a Stain once got in their Fame is hard∣ly ever to be washed out This you grant even when you give your self Leave to trifle If so What Cau∣tion is necessary in handling the Reputation of a Man whose wellbeing in this Life perhaps entirely depends on preserving it from any Wound which once there received too often becomes fatal and in∣curable Suppose some villainous Hand through Personal Prejudice transmits Materials for this Purpose which you publish to the World and after∣wards  become fully convinced you were imposed on us by this Time you may be of a Character you have sent into the World I say supposing this I would be glad to know what Reparation you think ought to be made the Person so injured admitting you stood in his Place It has always been held that a generous Education is the surest Mark of a generous Mind The former is indeed perspicuous in all your Papers and I am perswaded tho' you affect often to shew the latter yet you would not keep any Measures even of Christianity with those who should handle you in the Manner you do others The Application of all this is from your having very lately glanced at a Man under a Character that were he conscious to deserve he would be the first to rid the World of himself and would be more justi∣fiable in it to all Sorts of Men than you in your com∣mitting such a Violence on his Reputation which perhaps you may be convinced of in another Manner than you deserve from him  A Man of your Capacity Mr  Bickerstaff  should have more noble Views and pursue the true Spirit of Satyr but I will conclude lest I grow out of Temper and will only beg for your own Preservation to remember the Proverb of the Pitcher  I am Yours  A J  The Proverb of the Pitcher I have no Regard to but it would be an Insensibility not to be par∣doned if a Man could be untouched at so warm an Accusation and that laid with so much seem∣ing Temper All I can say to it is That if the Writer by the same Method whereby he con∣veyed this Letter shall give me an Instance wherein I have injured any good Man or point∣ed at any Thing which is not the true Object of Raillery I shall acknowledge the offence in as open a Manner as the Press can do it and lay down this Paper for ever  There is something very terrible in unjustly at∣tacking Men in a Way that may prejudice their Honour or Fortune but when Men of too Modest a Sense of themselves will think they are touched it is impossible to prevent ill Consequences from the most innocent and general Discourses This I have known happen in Circumstances the most foreign to theirs who have taken Offence at them An Advertisement lately published rela∣ting to  Omicron  alarmed a Gentleman of good Sense Integrity Honour and Industry which is in every Particular different from the trifling Pretenders pointed at in that Advertisement When the Modesty of some is as excessive as the Vanity of others What Defence is there against Misinterpretation However giving Disturbance though not intended to Men of virtuous Cha∣racters has so sincerely troubled me that I will break from this Satyrical Vein and to show I very little value my self upon it shall for this Month ensuing leave the  Sharper  the  Fop  the  Pedant  the  Proud Man  the  Insolent  in a Word all the Train of  Knaves  and  Fools  to their own Devices and touch on nothing but Panegyrick This Way is suitable to the true Genius of the  Staffs  who are much more inclined to reward than punish If therefore the Author of the Abovemention'd Let∣ter does not command my Silence wholly as he shall if I do not give him Satisfaction I shall for the abovementioned Space turn my Thoughts to raising Merit from its Obscurity celebrating Virtue in its Distress and attacking Vice by no other Me∣thod but setting Innocence in a proper Light  Will's Coffeehouse  Sept  I find here for me the following Letter  'Squire  Bickerstaff  FInding your Advice and Censure to have a good Effect I desire your Admonition to our Vicar and Schoolmaster who in his Preaching to his Au∣ditors  stretches his Jaws so wide that instead of instructing Youth it rather frightens them Like∣wise in reading Prayers he has such a careless Loll that People are justly offended at his irreverent Po∣sture besides the extraordinary Charge they are put to in sending their Children to dance to bring them off of those ill Gestures Another evil Faculty he has in making the BowlingGreen his daily Resi∣dence instead of his Church where his Curate reads Prayers every Day If the Weather is fair his Time is spent in Visiting if Cold or Wet in Bed or at least at Home though within Yards of the Church These out of many such irregular Practices I write for his Reclaimation But two or three Things more before I conclude to wit that generally when his Curate preaches in the After∣noon he sleeps sotting in the Desk on a Hissock With all this he is so extreamly proud that he will go but once to the Sick except they return his Visit  I was going on in reading my Letter when I was interrupted by Mr  Greenhat  who has been this Evening at the Play of  Hamlet  Mr  Bicker∣staff  said he had you been to Night at the Play∣house you had seen the Force of Action in Per∣fection Your admired Mr  Betterton  behaved himself so well that tho' now about Seventy he acted Youth and by the prevalent Power of proper Manner Gesture and Voice appeared thro' the whole  Drama  a young Man of great Expecta∣tion Vivacity and Enterprize The Soliloquy where he began the celebrated Sentence of  To be or not to be  the Expostulation where he ex∣plains with his Mother in her Closet the noble Ardor after seeing his Father's Ghost and his generous Distress for the Death of  Ophelia  are each of them Circumstances which dwell strongly upon the Minds of the Audience and would cer∣tainly affect their Behaviour on any parallel Oc∣casion  in their own Lives Pray Mr  Bicker∣staff  let us have Virtue thus represented on the Stage with its proper Ornaments or let these Ornaments be added to her in Places more sacred As for my Part said he I carried my Cousin  Jerry  this little Boy with me and shall always love the Child for his Partiality in all that con∣cerned the Fortune of  Hamlet  This is entring Youth into the Affections and Passions of Man∣hood beforehand and as it were antedating the Effects we hope from a long and liberal Educa∣tion  I cannot in the midst of many other Things which press hide the Comfort that this Letter from my ingenious Kinsman gives me  To my honoured Kinsman  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Oxford  Sept  Dear Cousin  I Am sorry though not surpriz'd to find that you have rallied the Men of Dress in vain that the Amberheaded Cane still maintains its unstable Post that Pockets are but a few In∣ches shortened and a Beau is still a Beau from the Crown of his Nightcap to the Heels of his Shoes For your Comfort I can assure you that your Endeavours succeed better in this famous Seat of Learning By them the Manners of our young Gentlemen are in a fair Way of Amendment and their very Language is mightily refined To them it is owing that not a Servitor will sing a Catch not a Senior Fellow make a Pun not a determining Batche∣lor drink a Bumper and I believe a Gen∣tleman Commoner would as soon have the Heels of his Shoes red as his Stockings When a Witling stands at a Coffeehouse Door and sneers at those who pass by to the great Im∣provement of his hopeful Audience he is no longer Sirnamed a  Slicer  but a Man of Fire is the Word A Beauty whose Health is drank  from  Heddington  to  Hinksey  who has been the Theme of the Muses her Cheeks painted with Roses and her Bosom planted with Orange Boughs has no more the Title of  Lady  but reigns an undisputed  Toast  When to the plain Garb of Gown and Band a Spark adds an incon∣sistent long Wig we do not say now he  Boshes  but there goes a  Smart  Fellow If a Virgin blushes we no longer cry she  Blues  He that drinks till he stares is no more  TowRow  but  Honest  A  Youngster  in a  Scrape  is a Word out of Date and what bright Man says I was  Joab'd  by the Dean  Bombouzling  is exploded a  Shat  is a Tatler and if the muscular Motion of a Man's Face be violent no Mortal says he  raises a Horse  but he's a  Merry Fellow  I congratulate you my dear Kinsman upon these Conquests such as  Roman  Emperors la∣mented they could not gain and in which you rival your Correspondent  Lewis le Grand  and his dictating Academy  Be yours the Glory to perform mine to re∣cord as Mr  Dryden  has said before me to  his  Kinsman and while you enter triumphant in∣to the Temple of the  Muses  I as my Office re∣quires will with my Staff on my Shoulder at∣tend and conduct you I am  Dear Cousin  Your most affectionate Kinsman  Benjamin Beadlestaff  Upon the humble Application of certain Persons who have made Heroick Figures in Mr  Bickerstaff  's Narrations Notice is hereby given That no such shall ever be mention'd for the future except those which have sent Menaces and not submitted to Ad∣monition  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Sept    White's Chocolatehouse  September  I Have taken upon me no very easy Task in turning all my Thoughts on Panegyrick when most of the Advices I receive tend to the quite coutrary Purpose and I have few Notices but such as regard Follies and Vices But the properest Way for me to treat is to keep in general upon the Passions and Affections of Men with as little Regard to Particulars as the Nature of the Thing will admit However I think there is something so passionate in the Circumstances of the Lovers mentioned in the following Letter that I am willing to go out of my Way to obey what is commanded in it  London  Sept  SIR  YOur Design of entertaining the Town with the Characters of the ancient Heroes as Persons shall send an Account to Mr  Morphew  's encourages me and others to beg of you that in the mean Time if it is not contrary to the Method you have proposed you would give us one Paper upon the Subject of  Pae∣tus  and his Wife's Death when  Nero  sent him an Order to kill himself His Wife setting him the Ex∣ample dy'd with these Words Patus  it is not pain∣ful  You must know the Story and your Observa∣tions upon it will oblige  SIR  Your most humble Servant  When the worst Man that ever lived in the World had the highest Station in it Humane Life  was the Object of his Diversion and he sent Orders frequently out of meer Wantonness to take off such and such without so much as being argry with 'em Nay frequently his Tyranny was so humorous that he put Men to Death be∣cause he could not but approve of 'em It came one Day to his Ear that a certain married Cou∣ple  Paetus  and  Arria  lived in a more happy Tranquility and mutual Love than any other Per∣sons who were then in Being He listen'd with great Attention to the Account of their Manner of spending their Time together of the constant Pleasure they were to each other in all their Words and Actions and found by exact Information that they were so treasonable as to be much more happy than his Imperial Majesty himself Upon which he writ  Paetus  the following Billet  Paetus  you are hereby desired to dispatch your self I have heard a very good Character of you and therefore leave it to your self whether you will die by Dagger Sword or Poison If you outlive this Order above an Hour I have given Directions to put you to Death by Torture  NERO  This familiar Epistle was delivered to his Wife  Arria  who opened it  One must have a Soul very well turned for Love Pity and Indignation to comprehend the Tumult this unhappy Lady was thrown into up∣on this Occasion The Passion of Love is no more to be understood by some Tempers than a Pro∣blem in a Science by an ignorant Man But be that knows what Affection is will have upon considering the Condition of  Arria  Ten Thou∣sand Thoughts flow in upon him which the Tongue was not form'd to express But the charming Statue is now before my Eyes and  Arria  in her unutterable Sorrow has more  Beauty than ever appeared in Youth in Mirth or in Triumph These are the great and noble Incidents which speak the Dignity of our Nature in our Sufferings and Distresses Behold her tender Affection for her Husband sinks her Fea∣tures into a Countenance which appears more helpless than that of an Infant But again her Indignation shows in her Visage and her Bosom a Resentment as strong as that of the bravest Man Long she stood in this Agony of alternate Rage and Love but at last composed her self for her Dissolution rather than survive her beloved  Pae∣tus  When he came into her Presence he found her with the Tyrant's Letter in one Hand and a Dagger in the other Upon his Approach to her she gave him the Order and at the same Time stabbing her self  Paetus  said she  it is not pain∣ful  and expired  Paetus  immediately followed her Example The Passion of these memorable Lovers was such that it illuded the Rigour of their Fortune and baffled the Force of a Blow which neither felt because each received it for the Sake of the other The Woman's Part in this Story is by much the more Heroick and has occasioned one of the best Epigrams transmitted to us from Antiquity  When  Arria  pull'd the Dagger from her Side  Thus to her Consort spoke th'illustrious Bride  The Wound I gave my self I do not grieve  I die by that which  Paetus  must receive  From my own Apartment  September  The Boy says one in a black Hat left the fol∣lowing Letter  th of the th Month  Friend  BEing of that Part of Christians whom Men call  Quakers  and being a Seeker of the Right Way I was perswaded Yesterday to hear one of your most noted Teachers The Matter he treated was the Necessity of a Wellliving  grounded upon a future State I was atten∣tive but the Man did not appear in earnest He read his Discourse notwithstanding thy Re∣bukes so heavily and with so little Air of be∣ing convinced himself that I thought he would have slept as I observed many of his Hearers did I came Home unedified and troubled in Mind I dip'd into the  Lamentations  and from thence turning to the th Chapter of  Exekiel  I found these Words  We be to the Shepherds of  Israel  that do feed themselves Should not the Shepherds feed the Flock Ye eat the Fat and ye cloath you with the Wool Ye kill them that are fed but ye feed not the Flock The Diseased have ye not strengthen'd neither have ye heal'd that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with Force and with Cruelty have ye ruled them  c Now I pray thee Friend as thou art a Man skill'd in many Things tell me Who is meant by the  Diseas'd  the  Sick  the  Broken  the  Driven away  and the  Lost  And whether the Prophecy in this Chapter be accomplish'd or yet to come to pass And thou wilt oblige they Friend though unknown  This Matter is too sacred for this Paper but I can't see what Injury it would do any Clergy∣man to have it in his Eye and believe all that are taken from him by his Want of Industry are to be demanded of him I dare say  Favonius  has very few of these Losses  Favonius  in the midst of a Thousand impertinent Assailants of the Divine Truths is an undisturbed Defender of'em He protects all under his Care by the Clearness of his Understanding and the Exam∣ple of his Life He visits dying Men with the  Air of a Man who hoped for his own Dissolution and enforces in others a Contempt of this Life by his own Expectation of the next His Voice and Behaviour are the lively Images of a composed and wellgoverned Zeal None can leave him for the frivolous Jargon uttered by the ordinary Teachers among Dissenters but such who cannot distinguish Vociferation from Eloquence and Argument from Railing He is so great a Judge of Mankind and touches our Passions with so su∣perior a Command that he who deserts his Con∣gregation must be a Stranger to the Dictates of Nature as well as to those of Grace  But I must proceed to other Matters and re∣solve the Questions of other Enquirers as in the following  Heddington  Sept  SIR  UPon reading that Part of the  Tatler  Num∣ber where Mention is made of a certain ChappelClerk there arose a Dispute and that pro∣duced a Wager Whether by the Words ChappelClerk was meant a Clergyman or a Layman By a Clergyman I mean one in holy Orders It was not that any Body in the Company pretended to guess who the Person was but some asserted that by Mr  Bickerstaff  's Words must be meant a Clergyman only Others said that those Words might have been said of any Clerk of a Parish and some of 'em more properly of a Layman The Wager is half a Dozen Bottles of Wine in which if you please to determine it your Health and all the Family of the  Staffs  shall certainly be drank and you will singularly oblige another very considerable Family I mean that of  Your humble Servants  The TrencherCaps  It is very customary with us learned Men to find Perplexities where no one else can see any The honest Gentlemen who writ me this are much at a Loss to understand what I thought very plain and in Return their Epistle is so plain that I can't understand it This perhaps is at first a little like Nonsence but I desire all Persons to examine these Writings with an Eye to my being far gone in the Occult Sciences and remember that it is the Privilege of the Learned and the Great to be understood when they please For as a Man of much Business may be allowed to leave Company when he pleases so one of high Learning may be above your Capacity when he thinks fit But without further Speeches or Fooling I must inform my Friends the  TrencherGaps  in plain Words that I meant in the Place they speak of a drunken Clerk of a Church And I will return their Civility among my Relations and drink their Healths as they do ours  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Sept  to  Tuesday Sept    White's Chocolatehouse  September  I Cannot express the Confusion the following Letter gave me which I received by Sir  Thomas  this Morning There cannot be a greater Suprize than to meet with sudden Enmity in the midst of a familiar and friendly Correspondence which is my Case in Relation to this Epistle And I have no Way to purge my self to the World but publishing both it and my Answer  Mr  Bickerstaff  YOU are a very impudent Fellow to put me into the  Tatler  Rot you Sir I have more Wit than you and rot me I have more  Money than most Fools I have bubbled All Persons of Quality admire me though roe me if I value a Blue Garter any more than I do a Blue Apron Every Body knows I am brave therefore have a Care how you pro∣voke  Monoculus  The ANSWER  SIR  DID I not very well know your Hand as well by the Spelling as the Character I should not have believed yours of to Day had come from you But when all Men are ac∣quainted that I have had all my Intelligence from you relating to your Fraternity let them pronounce who is the more impudent I con∣fess I have had a peculiar Tenderness for you by reason of that luxuriant Eloquence of which you are Master and have treated you accor∣dingly for which you have turned your flo∣rid Violence against your ancient Friend and Schoolfellow You know in your own Con∣science you gave me Leave to touch upon your Vein of Speaking provided I hid your other Ta∣lents in which I believed you sincere because like the ancient  Simon  you have before now suffer'd your self to be defaced to carry on a Plot Besides Sir Rot me Language for a Person of your present Station Fie fie I am really a∣shamed for you and shall no more depend up∣on your Intelligence Keep your Temper wash your Face and go to Bed  Isaac Bickerstaff  For ought I know this Fellow may have con∣fus'd the Description of the Pack on Purpose to ensnare the Game while I have all along belie∣ved he was destroying them as well as my self But because they pretend to bark more than or∣dinary I shall let 'em see that I will not throw  away the Whip till they know better how to behave themselves But I must not at the same Time omit the Praises of their Oeconomy ex∣press'd in the following Advice  Sept  Mr  Bickerstaff  THough your Thoughts are at present em∣ployed upon the Tables of  Fame  and marshalling your illustrious Dead 'tis hoped the Living may not be neglected nor defraud∣ed of their just Honours And since you have begun to publish to the World the great Saga∣city and Vigilance of the Knights of the Indu∣stry it will be expected you should proceed to do Justice to all the Societies of them you can be informed of especially since their own great Industry covers their Actions as much as possi∣ble from that publick Notice which is their Due  Paulum sepulte distat Inertiae  Celata Virtus  Hidden Vice and conceal'd Virtue are much alike  Be pleased therefore to let the following Me∣moirs have a Place in their History  In a certain Part of the Town famous for the freshest Oysters and the plainest  English  there is a House or rather a College sacred to Hospitality and the industrious Arts At the Entrance is hieroglyphically drawn a Cavali r contending with a Monster with Jaws expand∣ed just ready to devour him  Hither the Brethren of the Industry resort but to avoid Ostentation they wear no Habits of Distinction and perform their Exercises with as little Noise and Show as possible Here are no UnderGraduates but each is a Master of his Art They are distributed according to their various Talents and detached abroad in  Parties to divide the Labours of the Day They have Dogs as well nos'd and as fleet as any and no Sportsmen shew greater Activity Some beat for the Game some hunt it others come in at the Death and my honest Landlord makes very good Venison Sauce and eats his Share of the Dinner  I would fain pursue my Metaphors but a ve∣nerable Person who stands by me and waits to bring you this Letter and whom by a certain Benevolence in his Look I suspect to be  Pacolet  reproves me and obliges me to write in plainer Terms That the Society had fixed their Eyes on a gay young Gentleman who has lately suc∣ceeded to a Title and an Estate the latter of which they judged would be very convenient for them Therefore after several Attempts to get into his Acquaintance my Landlord finds an Opportunity to make his Court to a Friend of the young Spark's in the following Manner  Sir As I take you to be a Lover of Ingenuity and PlainDealing I shall speak very freely to you In a few Words then you are acquainted with Sir  Liberal Brisk  Providence has for our Emolument sent him a fair Estate for Men are not born for themselves Therefore if you'll bring him to my House we will  take Care of him  and you shall have half the Profits There's  Ace  and  Cutter  will do his Business to a Hair You'll tell me perhaps he's your Friend I grant it and 'tis for that I propose it to prevent his falling into ill Hands  We'll carve him like a Dish fit for the Gods  Not hew him like a Carcass fit for Hounds  In short there are to my certain Knowledge a Hundred Mouths open for him Now if we can secure him to our selves we shall disap∣point all those Rascals that don't deserve him  Nay you need not stare at it Sir 'tis for your own Advantage Besides  Partridge  has cast me his Nativity and I find by certain Destiny  his Oaks must be fell'd  The Gentleman to whom this honest Propo∣sal was made made little Answer but said he would consider of it and immediately took Coach to find out the young Baronet and told him all that had pass'd together with the new Salvo to satisfie a Man's Conscience in sacrifi∣cing his Friend Sir  Brisk  was fired swore a Dozen Oaths drew his Sword put it up again call'd for his Man beat him and bid him fetch a Coach His Friend asked him What he de∣sign'd and whither he was going He answer∣ed to find out the Villains and fight 'em To which his Friend agreed and promised to be his Second on Condition he would first divide his Estate to 'em and reserve only a Proportion to himself that so he might have the Justice of fighting his Equals His next Resolution was to play with 'em and let 'em see he was not the Bubble they took him for But he soon quitted that and resolved at last to tell  Bicker∣staff  of 'em and get 'em inrolled in the Order of the  Industry  with this Caution to all young landed Knights and 'Squires That whenever they are drawn to play they would consider it as calling 'em down to a Sentence already pro∣nounced upon 'em and think of the Sound of those Words  His Oaks must be fell'd  I am  SIR  Your faithful humble Servant  Will Trusty  From my own Apartment  September  It is wonderful to consider what a Pitch of Confidence this World is arrived at Do People believe I am made up of Patience I have long  told them that I will suffer no Enormity to pass without I have an Understanding with the Offen∣ders by Way of HushMoney and yet the Can∣didates at  QueenHithe  send Coals to all the Town but me All the publick Papers have had this Advertisement  London  Sept  To the Electors of an Alderman for the Ward of  QueenHithe  WHereas an evil and pernicious Custom has of late very much prevailed at the Election of Aldermen for this City by treating at Taverns and Alehouses thereby engaging many unwarily to give their Votes Which Practice appearing to Sir  Arthur de Bradly  to be of dangerous Consequence to the Freedom of Elections he hath avoided the Excess there∣of Nevertheless to make an Acknowledg∣ment to this Ward for their intended Favour he hath deposited in the Hands of Mr one of the present CommonCouncil Four Hundred and Fifty Pounds to be disposed of as follows provided the said Sir  Arthur de Bradly  be the Alderman  viz  All such that shall Poll for Sir  Arthur de Brad∣ly  shall have one Cha'dron of good Coals  gratis  And half a Chaldron to every one that shall not Poll against him  And the Remainder to be laid out in a Clock Dial or otherwise as the CommonCouncilMen of the said Ward shall think fit  And if any Person shall refuse to take the said Coals to himself he may assign the same to any poor Electors in the Ward  I do acknowledge to have received the said Four Hundred and Fifty Pounds for the Purposes abovementioned for which I have given a Receipt  Witness  Js Ht  Jy Gh  Ed Ds  Jn My  N B  Whereas several Persons have already engaged to Poll for Sir  Humphry Greenhat  it is hereby farther declared That every such Per∣son as doth Poll for Sir  Humphry Greenhat  and doth also Poll for Sir  Arthur de Bradly  shall each of them receive a Chaldron of Coals  gra∣tis  on the Proviso abovementioned  This is certainly the most plain Dealing that ever was used except that the just Quantity which an Elector may drink without Excess and the Difference between an Acknowledgment and a Bribe wants Explanation Another Difficulty with me is How a Man who is bargain'd with for a Chaldron of Coals for his Vote shall be said to have that Chaldron  gratis  If my Kins∣man  Greenhat  had given me the least Intimation of his Design I should have prevented his pub∣lishing Nonsence nor should any Knight in  Eng∣land  have put my Relation at the Bottom of the Leaf as a Postscript when after all it appears  Greenhat  has been the more popular Man There is here such open Contradiction and clumsy Art to palliate the Matter and prove to the People that the Freedom of Election is safer when laid out in Coals than strong Drink that I can turn this only to a Religious Use and admire the Dispen∣sation of Things for if these Fellows were as wise as they are rich Where would be our Liber∣ty This reminds me of a memorable Speech made to a City almost in the same Latitude with  Westminster When I think of your Wisdom I ad∣mire your Wealth when I think of your Wealth I admire your Wisdom  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Sept  to  Thursd Sept    White's Chocolatehouse  September  THE Writer of the following Letter has made an Use of me which I did not foresee I should fall into But the Gentleman having as∣sured me that he has a most tender Passion for the Fair One and speaking his Intentions with so much Sincerity I am willing to let 'em contrive an Interview by my Means  SIR  I Earnestly intreat you to publish the inclosed for I have no other Way to come at her or return to my self  A L  P S  Mr  Bickerstaff  You can't imagine how handsome she is The Su∣perscription of my Letter will make her recollect the Man that gaz'd at her Pray put it in  I can assure the young Lady the Gentleman is in the true Trammels of Love How else would he make his Superscription so very much longer than his Billet He superscribes  To the younger of the Two Ladies in Mourning who late in the hindmost Seat of the middle Box at Mr  Winstanley  's WaterWorks on  Tuesday  was Fortnight and had with them a Brother or some Acquaintance that was as careless of that pretty Creature as a Brother which seeming  Brother usher'd 'em to their Coach with great Respect Present  MADAM  I Have a very good Estate and wish my self your Husband Let me know by this Way where you live for I shall be miserable till we live together  Alexander Landlord  This is the modern Way of Bargain and Sale a certain Shorthand Writing in which Laconick Elder Brothers are very successful All my Fear is that the Nymph's elder Sister is unmarried If she is we are undone But perhaps the care∣less Fellow was her Husband and then she will let us go on  From my own Apartment  September  The following Letter has given me a new Sense of the Nature of my Writings I have the deepest Regard to Conviction and shall never act against it However I do not yet understand what good Man he thinks I have injured But his Epistle has such Weight in it that I shall al∣ways have Respect for his Admonition and desire the Continuance of it I am not conscious that I have spoke any Faults a Man may not mend if he pleases  Sept  Mr  Bickerstaff  WHen I read your Paper of  Thursday  I was surpriz'd to find mine of the th inserted at large I never intended my self or you a second Trouble of this Kind believing I had sufficiently pointed out the Man you had injur'd and that by this Time you were con∣vinced that Silence would be the best Answer but finding your Reflections are such as natu∣rally call for a Reply I take this Way of doing it and in the first Place return you Thanks for the Compliment made me of my seeming  Sense and Worth I do assure you I shall al∣ways endeavour to convince Mankind of the latter though I have no Pretence to the for∣mer But to come a little nearer I observe you put your self under a very severe Restriction even the laying down the  Tatler  for ever if I can give you an Instance  wherein you have in∣jur'd any good Man or pointed at any Thing which is not the true Object of Raillery  I must confess Mr  Bickerstaff  if the making a Man guilty of Vices that would shame the Gallows be the best Methods to  point at the true Object of Raillery  I have till this Time been very igno ant but if it be so I will venture to assert one Thing and lay it down as a Maxim even to the  Staffian  Race  viz  That that Method of Pointing ought no more to be pursued than those People ought to cut your Throat who suffer by it because I take both to be Murder and the Law is not in every pri∣vate Man's Hands to execute But indeed Sir were you the only Person would suffer by the  Tatler  's Discontinuance I have Malice enough to punish you in the Manner you prescribe but I am not so great an Enemy to the Town or my own Pleasures as to wish it nor that you would lay aside lashing the reigning Vices so long as you keep to the true Spirit of Satyr without descending to rake into Characters be∣low its Dignity for as you well observe  There is something very terrible in unjustly attacking Men in a Way that may prejudice their Honour or Fortune  and indeed where Crimes are enor∣mous the Delinquent deserves little Pity yet the Reporter may deserve less And here I am naturally led to that celebrated Author of  The whole Duty of Man  who hath set this Matter in a true Light in his Treatise of  the Govern∣ment of the Tongue  where speaking of un∣charitable Truths he says a Discovery of this  Kind  serves not to reclaim but enrage the Offen∣der and precipitate him into farther Degrees of Ill Modesty and Fear of Shame is one of those natural Restraints which the Wisdom of Heaven has put upon Mankind and he that once stum∣bles may yet by a Check of that Bridle recover again But when by a publick Detection he is fallen under that Infamy he feared he will then be apt to discard all Caution and to think he ower himself the utmost Pleasures of Vice as the Price of his Reputation Nay perhaps he advances farther and sets up for a revers'd Sort of Fame by being eminently wicked and he who before was but a clandestine Disciple becomes a Doctor of  Impiety  c  This Sort of Reasoning Sir most certainly induced our wise Legislators ve∣ry lately to repeal that Law which put the Stamp of Infamy in the Face of Felons there∣fore you had better give an Act of Oblivion to your Delinquents at least for Transportation than continue to mark them in so notorious a Manner I can't but applaud your design'd At∣tempt of  raising Merit from Obscurity cele∣brating Virtue in Distress and attacking Vice in another Method by setting Innocence in a proper Light  Your pursuing these noble Themes will make a greater Advance to the Reforma∣tion you seem to aim at than the Method you have hitherto taken by putting Mankind be∣yond the Power of retrieving themselves or indeed to think it possible But if after all your Endeavours in this new Way there should then remain any harden'd Impenitents you must e'en give 'em up to the Rigour of the Law as Delinquents not within the Benefit of their Clergy Pardon me good Mr  Bicker∣staff  for the Tediousness of this Epistle and believe 'tis not from any SelfConviction I have taken up so much of your Time or my own but supposing you mean all your Lu∣cubrations  should tend to the Good of Man∣kind I may the easier hope your Pardon be∣ing  SIR  Yours  c  Grecian Coffeehouse  September  This Evening I thought fit to notifie to the  Li∣terati  of this House and by that Means to all the World That on  Saturday  the th of  October  next ensuing I design to fix my first Table of  Fame  and desire that such as are acquainted with the Characters of the Twelve most famous Men that have ever appeared in the World would seud in their Lists or name any one Man for that Table assigning also his Place at it be∣fore that Time upon Pain of having such his Man of Fame postponed or placed too high for ever I shall not upon any Application whatso∣ever alter the Place which upon that Day I shall give to any of these Worthies But where∣as there are many who take upon them to ad∣mire this Hero or that Author upon Second∣hand I expect each Subscriber should under∣write his Reason for the Place he allots his Can∣didate  The Thing is of the last Consequence for we are about settling the greatest Point that has ever been debated in any Age and I shall take Pre∣cautions accordingly Let every Man who votes consider That he is now going to give away that for which the Soldier gave up his Rest his Pleasure and his Life the Scholar resign'd his whole Series of Thought his Midnight Repose and his Morning Slumbers In a Word he is as I may say to be Judge of that AfterLife which noble Spirits prefer to their very real Be∣ings I hope I shall be forgiven therefore if I make some Objections against their Jury as they shall occur to me The Whole of the Number  by whom they are to be try'd are to be Scholars I am perswaded also that  Aristotle  will be put up by all of that Class of Men However in Behalf of others such as wear the Livery of  Ari∣stotle  the Two famous Universities are called up∣on on this Occasion but I except the Men of  Queen's Exeter  and  Jesus  Colleges in  Oxford  who are not to be Electors because he shall not be crown'd from an implicit Faith in his Wri∣tings but receive his Honour from such Judges as shall allow him to be censur'd Upon this Election as I was just now going to say I banish all who think and speak after others to concern themselves in it For which Reason all illiterate distant Admirers are forbidden to corrupt the Voices by sending according to the new Mode any poor Students Coals and Candles for their Votes in Behalf of such Worthies as they pretend to esteem All NewsWriters are also excluded because they consider Fame as it is a Report which gives Foundation to the filling up their Rhapsodies and not as it is the Emanation or Consequence of good and evil Actions These are excepted against as justly as Butchers in case of Life and Death Their Familiarity with the greatest Names takes off the Delicacy of their Regard as dealing in Blood makes the  Lanii  less tender of spilling it  St James's Coffeehouse  September  Letters from  Lisbon  of the th Instant  N S  speak of a Battle which has been fought near the River  Cinca  in which General  Staremberg  had overthrown the Army of the Duke of  Anjou  The Persons who send this excuse their not gi∣ving Particulars because they believed an Ac∣count must have arrived here before we could hear from them They had Advices from diffe∣rent Parts which concurr'd in the Circumstances of the Action after which the Army of his  Catholick Majesty advanced as far as  Fraga  and the Enemy retir'd to  Saragossa  There are Re∣ports That the Duke of  Anjou  was in the En∣gagement but Letters of good Authority say That Prince was on the Road towards the Camp when he receiv'd the News of the Defeat of his Troops We promise our selves great Conse∣quences from such an Advantage obtain'd by so accomplish'd a General as  Staremberg  who a∣mong the Men of this present Age is esteemed the Third in Military Fame and Reputation  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Sept  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  September  I Am called off from publick Dissertations by a Domestick Affair of great Importance which is no less than the Disposal of my Sister  Jenny  for Life The Girl is a Girl of great Merit and pleasing Conversation but I being born of my Father's First Wife and she of his Third she converses with me rather like a Daughter than a Sister I have indeed told her That if she kept her Honour and behaved her self in such Man∣ner as became the  Bickerstaffs  I would get her an agreeable Man for her Husband which was a Promise I made her after reading a Passage in  Pliny  's  Epistles  That polite Author had been employ'd to find out a Consort for his Friend's Daughter and gives the following Character of the Man he had pitch'd upon  Aciliano plurlmum Vigoris Industriae quan∣quam in maxima Verecundia Est illi Facies libe∣ralis multo Sanguine multo Rubore suffusa Est ingenua totius Corporis Pulchritudo quidam fe∣natorius  Decor quae ego nequaquam arbitror negli∣genda Debet enim hoc Castitati Puellarum quasi Praemium dari  Acilianus  for that was the Gentleman's Name is a Man of extraordinary Vigour and Industry accompanied with the greatest Modesty He has very much of the Gentleman with a lively Colour and Flush of Health in his Aspect His whole Person is finely turn'd and speaks him a Man of Quality Which are Qualifications that I think ought by no Means to be overlook'd and should be bestow'd on a Daughter as the Reward of her Chastity  A Woman that will give her self Liberties need not put her Parents to so much Trouble for if she does not posses these Ornaments in a Hus∣band she can supply her self elsewhere But this is not the Case of my Sister  Jenny  who I may say without Vanity is as unspotted a Spinster as any in  Great Britain  I shall take this Occasion to recommend the Conduct of our own Family in this Particular  We have in the Genealogy of our House the Descriptions and Pictures of our Ancestors from the Time of King  Arthur  in whose Days there was one of my own Name a Knight of his Round Table and known by the Name of Sir  Isaac Bickerstaff  He was low of Stature and of a very swarthy Complexion not unlike a  Por∣tugueze  Jew But he was more prudent than Men of that Height usually are and would often communicate to his Friends his Design of leng∣thening and whitening his Posterity His eldest Son  Ralph  for that was his Name was for this Reason married to a Lady who had little else to recommend her but that she was very tall and very fair The Issue of this Match with the Help of high Shoes made a tolerable Figure in the next Age though the Complexion of the  Family was obscure 'till the Fourth Generation from that Marriage From which Time till the Reign of  William the Conqueror  the Females of our House were famous for their Needlework and fine Skins In the Male Line there happen∣ed an unlucky Accident in the Reign of  Richard  the Third the eldest Son of  Philip  then Chief of the Family being born with an Humpback and very high Nose This was the more astonish∣ing because none of his Forefathers ever had such a Blemish nor indeed was there any in the Neighbourhood of that Make except the But∣ler who was noted for round Shoulders and a  Roman  Nose What made the Nose the less excusable was the remarkable Smallness of his Eyes  These several Defects were mended by succeed∣ing Matches the Eyes were open'd in the next Generation and the Hump fell in a Century and half but the greatest Difficulty was how to re∣duce the Nose which I do not find was accom∣plish'd till about the Middle of  Henry  the Seventh's Reign or rather the Beginning of that of  Henry  the Eighth  But while our Ancestors were thus taken up in cultivating the Eyes and Nose the Face of the  Bickerstaffs  fell down insensibly into Chin which was not taken Notice of their Thoughts being so much employ'd upon the more noble Fea∣tures till it became almost too long to be reme∣died  But Length of Time and successive Care in our Alliances have cured this also and reduced our Faces into that tolerable Oval which we en∣joy at present I would not be tedious in this Discourse but cannot but observe that our Race suffer'd very much about Three Hundred Years ago by the Marriage of one of our Heiresses with an eminent Courtier who gave us SpindleShanks and Cramps in our Bones insomuch that we  did not recover our Health and Legs till Sir  Wal∣ter Bickerstaff  married  Maud  the MilkMaid of whom the then  Garter  King at Arms a facetious Person said pleasantly enough That she had spoil∣ed our Blood but mended our Constitutions  After this Account of the Effect our prudent Choice of Matches has had upon our Persons and Features I cannot but observe that there are daily Instances of as great Changes made by Mar∣riage upon Men's Minds and Humours One might wear any Passion out of a Family by Cul∣ture as skilful Gardiners blot a Colour out of a Tulip that hurts its Beauty One might produce an affable Temper out of a Shrew by grafting the Mild upon the Cholerick or raise a Jack∣pudding from a Prude by inoculating Mirth and Melancholy It is for Want of Care in the dispo∣sing of our Children with Regard to our Bodies and Minds that we go into an House and see such different Complexions and Humours in the same Race and Family But to me it is as plain as a Pikestaff from what Mixture it is that this Daughter silently lowers t'other steals a kind Look at you a third is exactly well behaved a fourth a Splenatick and a fifth a Coquet  In this Disposal of my Sister I have chosen with an Eye to her being a Wit and provided that the Bridegroom be a Man of sound and excellent Judgment who will seldom mind what she says when she begins to harangue For  Jenny  's only Imperfection is an Admiration of her Parts which inclines her to be a little but a ve∣ry little sluttish and you are ever to remark that we are apt to cultivate most and bring into Observation what we think most excellent in our selves or most capable of Improvement Thus my Sister instead of consulting her Glass and her Toilet for an Hour and an half after her private Devotions sits with her Nose full of Snuff and a Man's Nightcap on her Head read∣ing  in Plays and Romances Her Wit she thinks het Distinction therefore knows nothing of the Skill of Dress or making her Person agreeable It would make you laugh to see me often with my Spectacles on lacing her Stays for she is so very a Wit that she understands no ordinary Thing in the World  For this Reason I have disposed of her to a Man of Business who will soon let her see that to be well dress'd in good Humour and chearful in the Command of her Family are the Arts and Sci∣ences of Female Life I could have bestow'd her upon a Fine Gentleman who extremely admir'd her Wit and would have given her a Coach and Six But I found it absolutely necessary to cross the Strain for had they met they had eternally been Rivals in Discourse and in continual Contention for the Superiority of Understanding and brought forth Criticks Pedants or pretty good Poets As it is I expect an Offspring fit for the Habitation of City Town or Country Creatures that are docile and tractable in whatever we put 'em to  To convince Men of the Necessity of taking this Method let any one even below the Skill of an Astrologer behold the Turn of Faces he meets as soon as he passes  CheapsideConduit  and you see a deep Attention and a certain unthinking Sharpness in every Countenance They look at∣tentive but their Thoughts are engaged on mean Purposes To me it is very apparent when I see a Citizen pass by whether his Head is upon Woollen Silks Iron Sugar Indigo or Stocks Now this Trace of Thought appears or lies hid in the Race for Two or Three Generations  I know at this Time a Person of a vast Estate who is the immediate Descendant of a Fine Gen∣tleman but the GreatGrandson of a Broker in whom his Ancestor is now revived He is a very honest Gentleman in his Principles but can't for his Blood talk fairly He is heartily sorry for it  but he cheats by Constitution and overreaches by Instinct  The Happiness of the Man who Marries my Sister will be that he has no Faults to correct in her but her own a little Byass of Fancy or Par∣ticularity of Manners which grew in her self and can be amended by her From such an un∣tainted Couple we can hope to have our Family rise to its ancient Splendor of Face Air Counte∣nance Manner and Shape without discovering the Product of Ten Nations in one House  Oba∣diah Greenhat  says he never comes into any Company in  England  but he distinguishes the different Nations of which we are compos'd There is scarce such a living Creature as a True  Britain  We sit down indeed all Friends Ac∣quaintance and Neighbours but after Two Bot∣tles you see a  Dane  start up and swear The Kingdom is his own A  Saxon  drinks up the whole Quart and swears He'll dispute that with him A  Norman  ells 'em both He'll assert his Liberty And a  Welshman  cries They are all Fo∣reigners and Intruders of Yesterday and beats 'em out of the Room Such Accidents happen frequently among Neighbours Children and Cou∣sinGermans For which Reason I say study your Race or the Soil of your Family will dwin∣dle into Cits or 'Squires or run up into Wits or Madmen  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Octob  to  Thesd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  IT is a Thing very much to be lamented that a Man must use a certain Cunning to caution People against what it is their Interest to avoid  All Men will allow that it is a great and heroick Work to correct Men's Errors and at the Price of being called a Common Enemy to go on in being a Common Friend to my Fellow Subjects and Citizens But I am forced in this Work to revolve the same Thing in Ten Thousand Lights and cast 'em in as many Forms to come at Men's Minds and Affections in order to lead the Inno∣cent in Safety as well as disappoint the Artifices of Betrayers Since therefore I can make no Impression upon the offending Side I shall turn my Observations upon the Offended That is to say I must whip my Children for going into bad Company instead of railing at bad Company for insnaring my Children  The greatest Misfortune Men fall into arise from themselves and that Temper which is call'd very often tho' with great Injustice Good Nature is the Source of a numberless Train of Evils For which Reason we are to take this as a Rule That no Action is commendable which is not voluntary and we have made this a Maxim  That Man who is commonly call'd Good Natured is hardly to be thanked for any Thing he does be∣cause half that is acted about him is done rather by his Sufferance than Approbation  It is generally a Laziness of Disposition which chuses rather to let Things pass the worst Way than to go through the Pain of Examination It must be confessed such a one has so great a Benevolence in him that he bears a Thousand Uneasmesses rather than he will incommode others nay often when he has just Reason to be offended chuses to sit down with a small Injury than bring it into Reprehen∣sion out of pure Compassion to the Offender Such a Person has it usually said of him He is no Man's Enemy but his own which is in Ef∣fect saying He is a Friend to every Man but himself and his Friends For by a natural Conse∣quence of his neglecting himself he either inca∣pacitates  himself to be another's Friend or makes others cease to be his If I take no Care of my own Affairs no Man that is my Friend can take it ill if I am negligent also of his This soft Dis∣position if it continues uncorrected throws Men into a Sea of Difficulties  There is  Euphusius  with all the good Qualities in the World deserves well of no Body That universal Good will which is so strong in him ex∣poses him to the Assault of every Invader upon his Time his Conversation and his Property His Diet is Butchers Meat his Wenches are in plain Pinners and  Norwich  Crapes his Dress like other People his Income great and yet has he sel∣dom a Guinea at Command From these easy Gentlemen are collected Estates by Servants or Gamesters which latter Fraternity are excusable when we think of this Clan who seems born to be their Prey All therefore of the Family of  Actaeon  are to take Notice That they are hereby given up to the Brethren of the  Industry  with this Reserve only That they are to be marked as stricken Deer not for their own Sakes but to preserve the Herd from following them and coming within the Scent  I am obliged to leave this important Subject without telling whose Quarters are sever'd who has the Humbles who the Haunch and who the Legs of the last Stag that was pulled down but this is only deferred in Hopes my Deer will make their Escape without more Admonitions or Exam∣ples of which they have had in mine and the Town's Opinion too great a Plenty I must I say at present go to other Matters of Moment  White's Chocolatehouse  October  The Lady has answer'd the Letter of Mr  Alex∣ander Landlord  which was publish'd on  Thursday  last but in such a Manner as I do not think fit to proceed in the Affair for she has plainly told him That Love is her Design but Marria  her Aversion Bless me What is this Age come to that People can think to make a Pimp of an Astronomer  I shall not promote such Designs but shall leave her to find out her Admirer while I speak to ano∣ther Case sent to me by a Letter of  September  subscrib'd  Lovewell Barebones  where the Author desires me to suspend my Care of the Dead till I have done something for the Dying His Case is That the Lady he loves is ever accompanied by a Kinswoman one of those gay cunning Women who prevent all the Love which is not address'd to themselves This Creature takes upon her in his Mistress's Presence to ask him Whether Mrs  Flo∣rimel  that is the cruel One's Name is not very handsome upon which he looks silly then they both laugh our and she will tell him That Mrs  Florimel  had an equal Passion for him but defined him not to expect the first Time to be ad∣mitted in private but that now he was at Li∣berty before her only who was her Friend to speak his Mind and that his Mistress expected it Upon which  Florimel  acts a VirginConfusion and with some Disorder waits his Speech Here ever follows a deep Silence after which a loud Laugh Mr  Barebones  applies himself to me on this Occasion All the Advice I can give him is to find a Lover for the Confident for there is no other Bribe will prevail and I see by her Carri∣age that it is no hard Matter for she is too gay to have a particular Passion or to want a general One  Some Days ago the Town had a full Charge laid against my Essays and printed at large I altered not one Word of what he of the contrary Opinion said but have blotted out some warm Things said for me therefore please to hear the Council for the Defendant though I shall be so no otherwise than to take a middle Way and if possible keep Commendations from being insipid  to Men's Tast or Raillery pernicious to their Characters  Sept  Mr  Bickerstaff  AS I always looked upon Satyr as the best Friend to Reformation whilst its Lashes were gene∣ral so that Gentleman  See  Tatler  N  o  Sept  must excuse me if I do not see the Inconvenience of a Method he is so much concerned at The Errors he assigns in it I think are comprised  in the Desperation Men are generally driven too when by a publick Detection they fall under the Infamy they feared who otherwise by checking their Bridle might have recovered their Stumble and through a SelfConviction become their own Reformers So he that was before but a clandestine Disciple  to use his own Quotation  is now become a Doctor in Impiety  The little Suc∣cess that is to be expected by these Methods from a harden'd Offender is too evident to insist on yet it is true there is a great deal of Charity in this Sort of Reasoning whilst the Effects of those Crimes extend not beyond themselves But what Relation has this to your Proceedings It is not a circumstantial Guessing will serve turn for there are more than one to pretend to any of your Characters but there must at least be something that must amount to a nominal Description before even common Fame can separate me from the rest of Mankind to dart at A general Representation of an Action either ridiculous or enormous may make those winch which find too much Similitude in the Character with themselves to plead Not Guilty but none but a Witness to the Crime can charge them with the Guilt whilst the Indictment is general and the Offender has the Asylum of the whole World to protect him Here can then be no Injustice where no one is injured for it is themselves must appropriate the Saddle be∣fore Scandal can ride them  Your Method then in my Opinion is no Way subject to the Charge brought against it but on the contra∣ry I believe this Advantage is too often drawn from it that whilst we laugh at or detest the uncer∣tain Subject of the Satyr we often find something in the Error a Parallel to our selves and being insensi∣bly drawn to the Comparison we would get rid of we plunge deeper into the Mire and Shame produces  at which Advice has been too weak for and you Sir get Converts you never thought of  As for descending to Characters below the Digni∣ty of Satyr what Men think are not beneath Com∣mission I must assure him I think are not beneath Reproof For as there is as much Folly in a ridiculous Deportment as there is Enormity in a Criminal one so neither the one nor the other ought to plead Ex∣emption The Kennel of Curs are as much Enemies to the State as  Greg  for his Confederacy for as this betray'd our Government so the other does our Proper∣ty and one without the other is equally useless As for the Act of Oblivion he so strenuously insists on  Le Roy s'avisera  is a fashionable Answer and for his Modus of Panegyrick the Hint was unnecessary where Virtue need never ask twice for her Lawrel But as for his Reformation by Opposites I again must ask his Pardon if I think the Effects of these Sort of Reasonings by the Paucity of Converts are too great an Argument both of their Imbecility and Unsuccessfulness to believe it will be any better than mispending of Time by suspending a Method that will turn more to Advantage and which has no other Danger of losing Ground but by Discontinu∣ance And as I am certain of what he supposes that your Lucubrations are intended for the publick Benefit so I hope you will not give them so great an Interruption by laying aside the only Method that can render you beneficial to Mankind and a∣mong others agreeable to  SIR  Your humble Servant  c  St James's Coffeehouse  October  Letters from the Camp at  Havre  of the th Instant  N S  advise That the Trenches were o∣pen'd before  Mons  on the th of the last Month and the Approaches were carried on at Two At∣tacks with great Application and Success not∣withstanding the Rains which had fallen That the Besiegers had made themselves Masters of se∣veral Redoubts and other Outworks and had advanced the Approaches within Ten Paces of the Counterscarps of the Hornwork LieutenantGeneral  Cadogan  received a slight Wound in the Neck soon after opening the Trenches  The Enemy were throwing up

Letters from  Bern  say That the Army under the Command of Count  Thaun  had began to repass the Mountains and would shortly evacuate  Savoy  Whereas Mr  Bickerstaff  has receiv'd Intelligence That a young Gentleman who has taken my Dis∣courses upon  John Partridge  and others in too lite∣ral a Sense and is suing an elder Brother to an Ejectment the aforesaid young Gentleman is here∣by advised to drop his Action no Man being esteem∣ed dead in Law who eats and drinks and receives his Rents  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Octob  to  Thursd Octob    From my own Apartment  Octob  AS bad as the World is I find by very strict Observation upon Virtue and Vice that if Men appeared no worse than they really are I should have less Work than at present I am obli∣ged to undertake for their Reformation They have generally taken up a kind of inverted Am∣bition and affect even Faults and Imperfections of which they are innocent The other Day in a Coffeehouse I stood by a young Heir with a fresh sanguine and healthy Look who enter∣tained us with an Account of his Claps and his DietDrink though to my Knowledge he is as sound as any of his Tenants  This worthy Youth put me into Reflections up∣on that Subject and I observed the fantastical Humour to be so general that there is hardly a Man who is not more or less tainted with it The First of this Order of Men are the  Valetudinarians  who are never in Health but complain of Want of Stomach or Rest every Day till Noon and then de∣vour all which comes before them Lady  Dainty  is convinced that it is necessary for a Gentlewoman to be out of Order and to preserve that Chara∣cter she dines every Day in her Closet at Twelve that she may become her Table at Two and be unable to eat in Publick About five Years ago I remember it was the Fashion to be shortsighted A Man would not own an Acquaintance 'till he had first examined him with his Glass At a Lady's Entrance into the Playhouse you might see Tubes immediately levelled at her from every  Quarter of the Pit and SideBoxes However that Mode of Infirmity is out and the Age has recovered its Sight But the Blind seem to be succeeded by the Lame and a janty Limp is the present Beauty I think I have formerly obser∣ved a Cane is Part of the Dress of a Prig and always worn upon a Button for fear he should be thought to have an Occasion for it or be e∣steemed really and not genteely a Cripple I have considered but could never find out the Bottom of this Vanity I indeed have heard of a  Gascon  General who by the lucky grazing of a Bullet on the Roll of his Stocking took Occasion to halt all his Life after But as for our peacea∣ble Cripples I know no Foundation for their Behaviour without it may be supposed that in this Warlike Age some think a Cane the next Honour to a Wooden Leg This Sort of Affecta∣tion I have known run from one Limb or Mem∣ber to another Before the  Limpers  came in I remember a Race of  Lispers  fine Persons who took an Aversion to particular Letters in our Lan∣guage Some never uttered the Letter  H  and o∣thers had as mortal an Aversion to  S  Others have had their fashionable Defect in their Ears and would make you repeat all you said twice over I know an ancient Friend of mine whose Table is every Day surrounded with Flatterers that makes use of this sometimes as a Piece of Grandeur and at others as an Art to make them repeat their Commendations Such Affectations have been indeed in the World in ancient Times but they fell into them out of politick Ends  Alexander the Great  had a wry Neck which made it the Fashion in his Court to carry their Heads on one Side when they came into the Pre∣sence One who thought to outshine the whole Court carried his Head so overcomplaisantly that this martial Prince gave him so great a Box  on the Ear as set all the Heads of the Court up∣right  This Humour takes Place in our Minds as well as Bodies I know at this Time a young Gentle∣man who talks atheistically all Day in Coffeehouses and in his Degrees of Understanding sets up for a  Free Thinker  though it can be proved upon him he says his Prayers every Morning and Evening But this Class of modern Wits I shall reserve for a Chapter by it self  Of the like Turn are all your  MarriageHaters  who rail at the Noose at the Words  For ever and Aye  and at the same Time are secretly pining for some young Thing or other that makes their Hearts ake by her Refusal The next to these are such as pretend to govern their Wives and boast how ill they use them when at the same Time go to their Houses and you shall see them step as if they feared making a Noise and are as fond as an Alderman I don't know but sometimes these Pretences may arise from a Desire to conceal a contrary Defect than that they set up for I re∣member when I was a young Fellow we had a Companion of a very fearful Complexion who when we sate in to drink would desire us to take his Sword from him when he grew fuddled for 'twas his Misfortune to be quarrelsome  There are many many of these Evils which demand my Observation but because I have of late been thought somewhat too Satyrical I shall give them Warning and declare to the whole World that they are not true but false Hypo∣crites and make it out that they are good Men in their Hearts The Motive of this monstrous Affectation in the abovementioned and the like Particulars I take to proceed from that noble Thirst of Fame and Reputation which is planted in the Hearts of all Men As this produces ele∣gant Writings and gallant Actions in Men of great Abilities it also brings forth spurious Pro∣ductions  in Men who are not capable of distin∣guishing themselves by Things which are really Praiseworthy As the Desire of Fame in Men of true Wit and Gallantry shows it self in pro∣per Instances the same Desire in Men who have the Ambition without proper Faculties runs wild and discovers it self in a Thousand Extra∣vagancies by which they would signalize them∣selves from other and gain a Set of Admirers When I was a middleaged Man there were ma∣ny Societies of ambitious young Men in  England  who in their Pursuits after Fame were every Night employed in roasting Porters smoaking Coblers Knocking down Watchmen overturn∣ing Constables breaking Windows blackening SignPosts in the like immortal Enterprizes that dispersed their Reputation throughout the whole Kingdom One could hardly find a Knocker at a Door in a whole Street after a Midnight Expedition of these  Beaux Esprits  I was lately very much surprised by an Account of my Maid who entered my BedChamber this Morn∣ing in a very great Fright and told me She was afraid my Palour was haunted for that she had found several Panes of my Windows broken and the Floor strowed with Halfpence I have not yet a full Light into this new Way but am apt to think that it is a generous Piece of Wit that some of my Contemporaries make Use of to break Windows and leave Money to pay for them  St James's Coffeehouse  October  I have no Manner of News more than what she whole Town had t'other Day except that I have the Original Letter of the Mareschal  Bouf∣flers  to the  French  King after the late Battle in the Woods which I translate for the Benefit of the  English  Reader  SIR  THis is to let your Majesty understand That to your immortal Honour and the Destru∣ction of the Confederates your

Hints and sudden Starts of Fancy without any Order or Connexion after having spent my  self on more regular and elaborate Dissertations I am at present in this easy State of Mind sat down to my Sctutore where for the better Dis∣position of my Correspondence I have writ upon every Drawer the proper Title of its Contents as Hypocrisy Dice Patches Politicks Love Duels and so forth My various Advices are ranged under such several Heads saving only that I have a particular Box for  Pacolet  and ano∣ther for  Monoculas  I cannot but observe that my DuelBox which is filled by the Letter'd Men of Honour is so very ill spelt that it is hard to decipher their Writings My Love Box though on a quite contrary Subject filled with the Works of the fairest Hands in  Great Britain  is almost as unintelligible The private Drawer which is sacred to Politicks has in it some of the most refined Panegyricks and Satyrs that any Age has produced  I have now before me several Recommenda∣tions for Places at my Table of  Fame  Three of them are of an extraordinary Nature in which I find I am misunderstood and shall therefore beg Leave to produce them They are from a Quaker a Courtier and a Citizen  ISAAC  THY Lucubrations as thou lovest to call them have been persued by several of our Friends who have taken Offence Forasmuch as thou excludest out of the Brotherhood all Persons who are Praiseworthy for Religion we are afraid that thou wilt fill thy Table with none but Heathens and cannot hope to spy a Brother there for there are none of us who can be placed among murdering Heroes or ungodly Wits since we do not assail our Ene∣mie with the Arm of Flesh nor our Gain∣sayers with the Vanity of Humane Wisdom It therefore thou wilt demean thy self on this  Occasion with a right Judgment according to the Gifts that are in thee we desire thou wilt place  James Naylor  at the upper End of thy Table  Ezekiel Stiffrump  In Answer to my good Friend  Ezekiel  I must stand to it that I cannot break my Rule for the Sake of  James Naylor  not knowing whether  Alexander the Great  who is a Cholerick Hero won't resent his sitting at the upper End of the Table with his Hat on  But

they were formerly have not now a Groat to dispose of Fill your Table with good Company I know a Person of Quality that shall give you  l  for a Place at it Be secret and be rich  Yours You know my

Hands If I can take it I will  My Citizen writes the following  Mr  Isaac Bickerstaff  SIR  YOur  Tatler  of  September  am now read∣ing and in your List of famous Men de∣sire you not to forget Alderman  Whittington  who  began the World with a Cat and died worth Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds Sterling which he left to an only Daughter Three Years after his Mayoralty If you want any further Particulars of  Ditto  Alderman Daughter or Cat let me know and  per  first will advise the Needful Which concludes  Your loving Friend  Lemuel Leger  I shall have all due Regard to this Gentleman's Recommendation but cannot forbear observing how wonderfully this Sort of Style is adapted for the Dispatch of Business by leaving out insignifi∣cant Particles Besides that the dropping of the first Person is an artful Way to disengage a Man from the Guilt of rash Words or Promises But I am to consider that a Citizen's Reputation is Credit not Fame and am to leave these lofty Subjects for a Matter of private Concern in the next Letter before me  SIR  I Am just recovered out of a languishing Sickness by the Care of  Hippocrates  who visited me throughout my whole Illness and was so far from taking any Fee that he en∣quired into my Circumstances and would have relieved me also that Way but I did not want it I know no Method of Thanking him but recommending it to you to celebrate so great Humanity in the Manner you think fit and to do it with the Spirit and Sentiments of a Man just relieved from Grief Misery and Pain to Joy Satisfaction and Ease In which you will represent the grateful Sense of  Your Obedient Servant  T B  I think the Writer of this Letter has put the Matter in as good a Dress as I can for him yet I cannot but add my Applause to what this distres∣sed Man has said There is not a more useful Man in a Commonwealth than a good Physician and by Consequence no worthier a Person than he that uses his Skill with Generosity even to Persons of Condition and Compassion to those who are in Want Which is the Behaviour of  Hippocrates  who shows as much Liberality in his Practice as he does Wit in his Conversation and Skill in his Profession A wealthy Doctor who can help a poor Man and will not without a Fee has less Sense of Humanity than a poor Ruffian who kills a rich Man to supply his Ne∣cessities It is something monstrous to consider a Man of a liberal Education tearing out the Bowels of a poor Family by taking for a Visit what would keep them a Week  Hippocrates  needs not the Comparison of such Extortion to set off his Generosity but I mention his Genero∣sity to add Shame to such Extortion  This is to give Notice to all ingenious Gentlemen in and about the Cities of  London  and  Westmin∣ster  who have a Mind to be instructed in the noble Sciences of Musick Poetry and Politicks That they repair to the  Smyrna  Coffeehouse in  Pall mall  be∣twixt the Hours of Eight and Ten at Night where they may be instructed  gratis  with elaborate Essays by Word of Mouth on all or any of the abovemen∣tioned Arts The Disciples are to prepare their Bodies with Three Dishes of Bohea and purge their Brains with Two Pinches of Snuff If any

much lamented by the Porters and Chairmen who were much edified through a Pane of Glass that remained broken all the last Sum∣mer  I cannot forbear advertising my Correspondents that I think my self treated by some of them after too familiar a Manner and in Phrases that nei∣ther become them to give nor me to take I shall therefore desire for the future that if any one re∣turns me an Answer to a Letter he will not tell me he has received the  Favour of my Letter  but if he does not think fit to say he has re∣ceived the  Honour  of it that he tell me in plain  English  he has received my Letter of such a Date I must likewise insist that he would con∣clude with  I am with great Respect  or plain∣ly  I am  without further Addition and not insult me by an Assurance of his being with  great Truth  and  Esteem  my humble Servant There is likewise another Mark of Superiority which I cannot bear and therefore must inform my Correspondents that I discard all  faithful  hum∣ble Servants and am resolved to read no Letters that are not subscribed  Your most obedient  or  most humble Servant  or both These may appear Niceties to vulgar Minds but they are such as Men of Honour and Distinction must have Regard to And I very well remember a famous Duel in  France  where Four were killed of one Side and Three of the other occasioned by a Gentle∣man's subscribing himself a  most affectionate Friend  One in the Morning of the th of  Octob    I was this Night looking on the Moon and find by certain Signs in that Luminary that a certain Person under her Dominion who has been for many Years distempered will within few Hours publish a Pamphlet wherein he will pretend to give my Lu∣cubrations to a wrong Person and I require all so∣ber disposed Persons to avoid meeting the said Lu∣natick or giving him any Credence any farther than Pity demands and to lock up the said Per∣son wherever they find him keeping him from Pen Ink and Paper And I hereby prohibit any Person to take upon him my Writings on Pain of being sent by me into  Lethe  with the said Lunatick and all his Works  The TATLER N  o    Felices ter amplius  Quos irrupta tenet Copula nec malis  Divulsus Querimoniis  Supremâ citius solvet Amor Die  Hor  From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesday Octob    From my own Apartment  October  MY Sister  Jenny  's Lover the honest  Tranquil∣lus  for that shall be his Name has been impatient with me to dispatch the necessary Di∣rections for his Marriage that while I am taken up with imaginary Schemes as he called them he might not burn with real Desire and the Tor∣ture of Expectation When I had reprimanded him for the Ardor wherein he expressed him∣self which I thought had not enough of that Ve∣neration  with which the MarriageBed is to be ascended I told him the Day of his Nuptials should be on the  Saturday  following which was the th Instant On the th in the Evening poor  Jenny  came into my Chamber and having her Heart full of the great Change of Life from a Virgin Condition to that of a Wife she long sate silent I saw she expected me to entertain her on this important Subject which was too delicate a Circumstance for her self to touch upon whereupon I relieved her Modesty in the follow∣ing Manner Sister said I you are now going from me and be contented that you leave the Company of a talkative old Man for that of a sober young One But take this along with you That there is no Mean in the State you are en∣tring into but you are to be exquisitely happy or miserable and your Fortune in this Way of Life will be wholly of your own making In all the Marriages I have ever seen most of which have been unhappy Ones the great Cause of Evil has proceeded from slight Occasions and I take it to be the first Maxim in a married Condition That you are to be above Trifles When Two Persons have so good an Opinion of each other as to come together for Life they will not differ in Matters of Importance because they think of each other with Respect in Regard to all Things of Consideration that may affect them and are prepared for mutual Assistance and Relief in such Occurrences but for less Occasions they have formed no Resolu∣tions but leave their Minds unprepared  This dear  Jenny  is the Reason that the Quar∣rel between Sir  Harry Willit  and his Lady which began about her Squirrel is irreconcilable Sir  Harry  was reading a grave Author she runs into his Study and in a playing Humour claps the Squirrel upon the Folio He threw the Ani∣mal in a Rage on the Floor she snatches it up again calls Sir  Harry  a sowr Pedant without  good Nature or good Manners This cast him into such a Rage that he threw down the Table before him kick'd the Book round the Room then recollected himself Lord Ma∣dam said he Why did you run into such Ex∣pressions I was said he in the highest Delight with that Author when you clap'd your Squirrel upon my Book and smiling added upon Re∣collection I have a great Respect for your Fa∣vourite and pray let us all be Friends My Lady was so far from accepting this Apology that she immediately conceived a Resolution to keep him under for ever and with a serious Air replied There is no Regard to be had to what a Man says who can fall into so indecent a Rage and such an abject Submission in the same Mo∣ment for which I absolutely despise you Upon which she rushed out of the Room Sir  Harry  stayed some Minutes behind to think and com∣mand himself after which he followed her into her Bedchamber where she was prostrate upon the Bed tearing her Hair and naming Twenty Coxcombs who would have used her otherwise This provoked him to so high a Degree that he forbore nothing but Beating her and all the Ser∣vants in the Family were at their several Stations listening while the best Man and Woman the best Master and Mistress defamed each other in a Way that is not be repeated even at  Billings∣gate  You know this ended in an immediate Se∣paration She longs to return Home but knows not how to do it He invites her Home every Day and lies with every Woman he can get Her Husband requires no Submission of her but she thinks her very Return will argue she is to blame which she is resolved to be for ever rather than acknowledge it  Thus dear  Jenny  my great Advice to you is Be guarded against giving or receiving little Pro∣vocations Great Matters of Offence I have no  Reason to fear either from you or your Husband After this we turned our Discourse into a more gay Style and parted But before we did so I made her resign her SnuffBox for ever and half drown her self with washing away the Stench of the Musty  But the Wedding Morning arrived and our Family being very numerous there was no a∣voiding the Inconvenience of making the Cere∣mony and Festival more publick than the mo∣dern Way of celebrating them makes me approve of The Bride next Morning came out of her Chamber dressed with all the Art and Care that Mrs  Toilet  the TireWoman could bestow on her She was on her WeddingDay Three and twenty Her Person is far from what we call a regular Beauty but a certain Sweetness in her Countenance an Ease in her Shape and Motion with an unaffected Modesty in her Looks had At∣tractions beyond what Symmetry and Exactness can inspire without the Addition of these Endow∣ments When her Lover entered the Room her Features flush'd with Shame and Joy and the in∣genuous Manner so full of Passion and of Awe with which  Tranquillus  approached to salute her gave me good Omens of his future Behaviour to∣wards her The Wedding was wholly under my Care After the Ceremony at Church I was resol∣ved to entertain the Company with a Dinner suita∣ble to the Occasion and pitch'd upon the  Apollo  at the  Old Devil  at  TempleBar  as a Place sacred to Mirth temper'd with Discretion where  BenJohn∣son  and his Sons used to make their liberal Meetings Here the Chief of the  Staffian  Race appeared and as soon as the Company were come into that am∣ple Room  Lepidus Wagstaff  began to make me Compliments for chusing that Place and fell in∣to a Discourse upon the Subject of Pleasure and Entertainment drawn from the Rules of  Ben  's Club which are in Gold Letters over the Chim∣ney  Lepidus  has a Way very uncommon and speaks on Subjects on which any Man else would certainly offend with great Dexterity He gave us a large Account of the publick Meetings of all the wellturned Minds who had passed through this Life in Ages past and closed his pleasing Narrative with a Discourse on Marriage and a Repetition of the following Verses out of  Milton  Hail wedded Love mysterious Law true Source  Of humane Offspring sole Propriety  In Paradise of all Things common else  By thee adult'rous Lust was driv'n from Men  Among the bestial Herds to range by thee  Founded in Reason loyal just and pure  Relations dear and all the Charities  Of Father Son and Brother first were known  Perpetual Fountain of domestick Sweets  Whose Bed is undefiled and chast pronounced  Present or past as Saints or Patriarchs used  Here Love his Golden Shafts employs here lights  His constant Lamp and waves his Purple Wings  Reigns here and revels not in the bought Smile  Of Harlots loveless joyless unindear'd  Casual Fruition nor in Court Amours  Mixed Dance or wanton Mask or Midnight Ball  Or Serenade which the starv'd Lover sings  To his proud Fair best quitted with Disdain  In these Verses all the Images that can come into a young Woman's Head on such an Occasion are raised but that in so chast and elegant a Manner that the Bride thanked him for his a∣greeable Talk and we sate down to Dinner  Among the rest of the Company there was got in a Fellow you call a  Wag  This ingenious Per∣son is the usual Life of all Feasts and Merriments by speaking Absurdities and putting every Body of Breeding and Modesty out of Countenance As soon as we sate down he drank to the Bride's  Diversion that Night and then made Twenty double Meanings on the Word  Thing  We are the best bred Family for one so numerous in this Kingdom and indeed we should all of us have been as much out of Countenance as the Bride but that we were relieved by an honest rough Relation of ours at the lower End of the Table who is a Lieutenant of Marines This Soldier and Sailor had good plain Sense and saw what was wrong as well as another he had a Way of looking at his Plate and speaking aloud in an inward Manner and whenever the  Wag  mentioned the Word  Thing  or the Words  That same  the Lieutenant in that Voice cried  Knock him down  The merry Man wondring angry and looking round was the Diversion of the Table When he offered to recover and say To the Bride's best Thoughts  Knock him down  says the Lieutenant and so on This silly Hu∣mour diverted and saved us from the fulsom Entertainment of an illbred Coxcomb and the Bride drank the Lieutenant's Health We re∣turned to my Lodging and  Tranquillus  led his Wife to her Apartment without the Ceremony of throwing the Stocking which generally costs Two or Three Maidenheads without any Cere∣mony at all  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Octob  to  Thursd Octob    Grecian Coffeehouse  October  THIS learned Board has complained to me of the exorbitant Price of late Years put upon Books and consequently on Learning which has raised the Reward demanded by learned Men  for their Advice and Labour In order to regu∣late and fix a Standard in these Matters Divines Physicians and Lawyers have sent in large Pro∣posals which are of great Light and Instruction From the Perusal of these Memorials I am come to this immediate Resolution till I have Leisure to treat the Matter at large  viz  In Divinity Fathers shall be valued according to their Anti∣quity Schoolmen by the Pound Weight and Sermons by their Goodness In my own Pro∣fession which is mostly Physick Authors shall be rated according to their Language The  Greek  is so rarely understood and the  English  so well I judge them of no Value so that only  Latin  shall bear a Price and that too according to its Pu∣rity and as it serves best for Prescription In Law the Value must be set according to the In∣tricacy and Obscurity of the Author and Black∣ness of the Letter provided always that the Binding be of CalvesSkin This Method I shall settle also with Relation to all other Writings insomuch that even these our Lucubrations though hereafter printed by  Aldus Elzevir  or  Stephanus  shall not advance above one single Penny  White's Chocolatehouse  October  It will be allowed me that I have all along showed great Respect in Matters which concern the

VisitingDay When I enter'd the Room where she re∣ceives Company they all stood up indeed but they stood as if they were to stare at rather than to receive me After a long Pause a Ser∣vant  brought a round Stool on which I sat down at the lower End of the Room in the Presence of no less than Twelve Persons Gen∣tlemen and Ladies lolling in ElbowChairs And to compleat my Disgrace my Mistress was of the Society I tried to compose my self in vain not knowing how to dispose of either my Legs or Arms nor how to shape my Coun∣tenance the Eyes of the whole Room being still upon me in a profound Silence My Con∣fusion at last was so great that without speak∣ing or being spoken to I fled for it and left the Assembly to treat me at their Discretion A Lecture from you upon these inhumane Distin∣ctions in a free Nation will I doubt not pre∣vent the like Evils for the future and make it as we say As cheap Sitting as Standing I am with the greatest Respect  SIR  Your most Humble and most

admitted I bid her show him up met him at my ChamberDoor and then fell back a few Paces He approach'd me with great Respect and told me with a low Voice He was the Gen∣tleman that had been seated upon the Round Stool I immediately recollected that there was a Joint  Stool in my Chamber which I was afraid he might take for an Instrument of Distinction and therefore winked at my Boy to carry it into my Closet I then took him by the Hand and led him to the upper End of my Room where I placed him in my great ElbowChair at the same Time drawing another without Arms to it for my self to sit by him I then asked him At what Time this Misfortune befel him He answer'd Between the Hours of Seven and Eight in the Evening I further demanded of him What he had eat or drank that Day He replied Nothing but a Dish of Watergruel with a few Plumbs in it In the next Place I felt his Pulse which was very low and languishing These Circumstances con∣firmed me in an Opinion which I had entertained upon the first reading of his Letter that the Gentleman was far gone in the Spleen I therefore advised him to rise the next Morning and plunge into the Cold Bath there to remain under Water 'till he was almost drowned This I ordered him to repeat Six Days successively and on the Seventh to repair at the wonted Hour to my Lady  Haughty  's and to acquaint me afterwards with what he shall meet with there and particularly to tell me whether be shall think they stared upon him so much as the Time before The Gentleman smiled and by his Way of talking to me shewed himself a Man of ex∣cellent Sense in all Particulars unless when a CaneChair a Round or a JointStool were spo∣ken of He opened his Heart to me at the same Time concerning several other Grievances such as being overlook'd in publick Assemblies having his Bows unanswer'd being helped last at Table and placed at the back Part of a Coach with many other Distresses which have wither'd his Countenance and worn him to a Skeleton Find∣ing him a Man of Reason I entered into the Bottom of his Distemper Sir said I there are  more of your Constitution in this Island of  Great Britain  than in any other Part of the World and I beg the Favour of you to tell me Whether you do not observe that you meet with most Affronts in rainy Days He answered candidly That he had long observed that People were less sawcy in Sunshine than in cloudy Weather Upon which I told him plainly his Distemper was the Spleen and that though the World was very illnatured it was not so bad as he believed it I further assured him That his Use of the Cold Bath with a Course of Steel which I should prescribe him would certainly cure most of his Acquaintance of their Rudeness ill Behaviour and Impertinence My Patient smiled and pro∣mised to observe my Prescriptions not forgetting to give me an Account of their Operation This Distemper being pretty Epidemical I shall for the Benefit of Mankind give the Publick an Account of the Progress I make in the Cure of it  From my own Apartment  October  The Author of the following Letter behaves himself so ingenuously that I cannot defer an∣swering him any longer  Octob  Honoured Sir  I Have lately contracted a very honest and undissembled Claudication in my Left Foot which will be a double Affliction to me if according to your  Tatler  of this Day it must pass upon the World for a Piece of Singularity and Affectation I must therefore humbly beg Leave to limp along the Streets after my own Way or I shall be inevitably ruined in Coach∣hire As soon as I am tolerably recovered I promise to walk as upright as a Ghost it a Tragedy being not of a Stature to spare an Inch of Height that I can any Way pretend to  I honour your Lucubrations and am with the most profound Submission  Honoured Sir  Your most Dutiful and Most obedient Servant  c  Not doubting but the Case is as the Gentleman represents I do hereby order Mr  Morphew  to de∣liver him out a Licence upon paying his Fees which shall empower him to wear a Cane till the th of  March  next Five Months being the most I can allow for a Sprain  St James's Coffeehouse  October  We received this Morning a Mail from  Hol∣land  which brings Advice That the Siege of  Mons  is carried on with so great Vigour and Bra∣very that we hope very suddenly to be Masters of the Place All Things necessary being prepa∣red for making the Assault on the Hornwork and Ravelin of the Attack of  Bertamont  the Charge began with the Fire of Bombs and Grenades which was so hot that the Enemy quitted their Post and we lodged our selves on those Works with∣out Opposition During this Storm one of our Bombs fell into a Magazine of the Enemy and blew it up There are Advices which say the Court of  France  had made new Offers of Peace to the Confederates but this Intelligence wants Confirmation  The TATLER N  o    Hic Manus ob Patriam pugnando Vulnera passi  Qui{que} pii Vates Phoebo digna locuti  Inventas aut qui Vitam excoluere per Artes  Qui{que} sui memores alios fecere merendo  Virg  From  Thursd Oct  to  Saturd Oct    From my own Apartment  October  THere are two Kinds of Immortality that which the Soul really enjoys after this Life and that Imaginary Existence by which Men live in their Fame and Reputation The best and greatest Actions have proceeded from the Pro∣spect of the one or the other of these but my Design is to treat only of those who have chiefly proposed to themselves the latter as the principal Reward of their Labours It was for this Rea∣son that I excluded from my Tables of Fame all the great Founders and Votaries of Religion and it is for this Reason also that I am more than ordinarily anxious to do Justice to the Persons of whom I am now going to speak for since Fame was the only End of all their Enterprizes and Studies a Man cannot be too scrupulous in allot∣ting them their due Proportion of it It was this Consideration which made me call the whole Body of the Learned to my Assistance to many of whom I must own my Obligations for the Ca∣talogues of illustrious Persons which they have sent me in upon this Occasion I Yesterday em∣ployed the whole Afternoon in comparing them with each other which made so strong an Im∣pression upon my Imagination that they broke  my Sleep for the first Part of the following Night and at length threw me into a very agree∣able Vision which I shall beg Leave to describe in all its Particulars  I dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundless Plain that was covered with prodi∣gious Multitudes of People which no Man could number In the Midst of it there stood a Moun∣tain with its Head above the Clouds The Sides were extremely steep and of such a particular Structure that no Creature which was not made in an Humane Figure could possibly ascend it On a sudden there was heard from the Top of it a Sound like that of a Trumpet but so exceed∣ing sweet and harmonious that it filled the Hearts of those who heard it with Raptures and gave such high and delightful Sensations as seemed to animate and raise Humane Nature a∣bove it self This made me very much amazed to find so very few in that innumerable Multi∣tude who had Ears fine enough to hear or relish this Musick with Pleasure But my Wonder a∣bated when upon looking round me I saw most of them attentive to Three Sirens cloathed like Goddesses and distinguished by the Names of  Sloth Ignorance  and  Pleasure  They were seated on Three Rocks amidst a beautiful Variety of Groves Meadows and Rivulets that lay on the Borders of the Mountain While the base and groveling Multitude of different Nations Ranks and Ages were listening to the sedelu∣sive Deities those of a more erect Aspect and exalted Spirit separated themselves from the rest and marched in great Bodies towards the Moun∣tain from whence they heard the Sound which still grew sweeter the more they listened to it  On a sudden methought this select Band sprang forward with a Resolution to climb the Ascent and follow the Call of that Heavenly  Musick Every one took something with him that he thought might be of Assistance to him in his March Several had their Swords drawn some carried Rolls of Paper in their Hands some had Compasses others Quadrants others Teles∣copes and others Pencils some had Lawrels on their Heads and others Buskins on their Legs In short there was scarce any Instrument of a Mechanick Art or Liberal Science which was not made Use of on this Occasion My good  Daemon  who stood at my Right Hand during the Course of this whole Vision observing in me a burning Desire to join that glorious Company told me he highly approved that generous Ar∣dor with which I seemed transported but at the same Time advised me to cover my Face with a Mask all the while I was to labour on the Ascent I took his Counsel without inquiring into his Reasons The whole Body now broke into dif∣ferent Parties and began to climb the Precipice by Ten Thousand different Paths Several got into little Allies which did not reach far up the Hill before they ended and led no further And I ob∣served That most of the Artizans which considera∣bly diminish'd our Number fell into these Paths  We left another considerable Body of Adven∣turers behind us who thought they had disco∣vered ByWays up the Hill which proved so very intricate and perplexed that after having advanced in them a little they were quite lost a∣mong the several Turns and Windings and tho' they were as active as any in their Motions they made but little Progress in the Ascent These as my Guide informed me were Men of subtle Tempers and puzzled Politicks who would supply the Place of real Wisdom with Cunning and Artifice Among those who were far ad∣vanced in their Way there were some that by one false Step fell backward and lost more Ground in a Moment than they had gain'd for many  Hours or could be ever able to recover We were now advanced very high and observed That all the different Paths which ran about the Sides of the Mountain began to meet in Two great Roads which insensibly gather'd the whole Multitude of Travellers into Two great Bodies At a little Distance from the Entrance of each Road there stood an hideous Phantom that op∣posed our further Passage One of these Appari∣tions had his Right Hand filled with Darts which he brandished in the Face of all who came up that Way Crowds ran back at the Appearance of it and cried out  Death  The Spectre that guarded the other Road was  Envy  She was not armed with Weapons of Destruction like the former but by dreadful Hissings Noises of Re∣proach and a horrid distracted Laughter she appeared more frightful than Death it self inso∣much that Abundance of our Company were dis∣couraged from passing any further and some ap∣peared ashamed of having come so far As for my self I must confess my Heart shrunk within me at the Sight of these ghastly Appearances But on a sudden the Voice of the Trumpet came more full upon us so that we felt a new Resolu∣tion reviving in us and in Proportion as this Resolution grew the Terrors before us seem'd to vanish Most of the Company who had Swords in their Hands marched on with great Spirit and an Air of Defiance up the Road that was commanded by Death while others who had Thought and Contemplation in their Looks went forward in a more composed Manner up the Road possessed by  Envy  The Way above these Apparitions grew smooth and uniform and was so delightful that the Travellers went on with Pleasure and in a little Time arrived at the Top of the Mountain They here began to breath a delicious kind of Aether and saw all the Fields about them covered with a kind of  Purple Light that made them reflect with Satis∣faction on their past Toils and diffused a secret Joy through the whole Assembly which shewed it self in every Look and Feature In the Midst of these happy Fields there stood a Palace of a very glorious Structure It had Four great Fold∣ingDoors that faced the Four several Quarters of the World On the Top of it was enthron'd the Goddess of the Mountain who smiled upon her Votaries and sounded the Silver Trumpet which had called them up and cheared them in their Passage to her Palace They had now for∣med themselves into several Divisions a Band of Historians taking their Stations at each Door according to the Persons whom they were to in∣troduce  On a sudden the Trumpet which had hitherto sounded only a March or a Point of War now swell'd all its Notes into Triumph and Exulta∣tion The whole Fabrick shook and the Doors flew open The first who stepped forward was a beautiful and blooming Hero and as I heard by the Murmurs round me  Alexander the Great  He was conducted by a Crowd of Historians The Person who immediately walked before him was remarkable for an embroider'd Garment who not being well acquainted with the Place was conducting him to an Apartment appointed for the Reception of fabulous Heroes The Name of this false Guide was  Quintus Curtius  But  Arrian  and  Plutarch  who knew better the Avenues of this Palace conducted him into the great Hall and placed him at the upper End of the First Table My good Daemon that I might see the whole Ceremony conveyed me to a Cor∣ner of this Room where I might perceive all that passed without being seen my self The next who entered was a Charming Virgin lead∣ing in a venerable old Man that was blind Un∣der her Left Arm she bore a Harp and on her  Head a Garland  Alexander  who was very well acquainted with  Homer  stood up at his Entrance and placed him on his Right Hand The Virgin who it seems was one of the Nine Sisters that attended on the Goddess of  Fame  smiled with an ineffable Grace at their Meeting and retired  Julius Caesar  was now coming forward and tho' most of the Historians offered their Service to introduce him he left them at the Door and would have no Conductor but himself  The next who advanced was a Man of a home∣ly but chearful Aspect and attended by Persons of greater Figure than any that appeared on this Occasion  Plato  was on his Right Hand and  Xenophon  on his Left He bowed to  Homer  and sate down by him It was expected that  Plato  would himself have taken a Place next to his Master  Socrates  but on a sudden there was heard a great Clamour of Disputants at the Door who appeared with  Aristotle  at the Head of them That Philosopher with some Rudeness but great Strength of Reason convinced the whole Table that a Title to the Fifth Place was his Due and took it accordingly  He had scarce sate down when the same beautiful Virgin that had introduced  Homer  brought in ano∣ther who hung back at the Entrance and would have excused himself had not his Modesty been o∣vercome by the Invitation of all who sate at the Ta∣ble His Guide and Behaviour made me easily con∣clude it was  Virgil Cicero  next appeared and took his Place He had inquired at the Door for one  Luc∣  us  to introduce him but not finding him there he contented himself with the Attendance of many other Writers who all except  Sallust  ap∣peared highly pleased with the Office  We waited some Time in Expectation of the next Worthy who came in with a great Retinue of Historians whose Names I could not learn most of them being Natives of  Carthage  The  Person thus conducted who was  Hannibal  seem∣ed much disturbed and could not forbear com∣plaining to the Board of the Affronts he had met with among the  Roman  Historians who attempt∣ed says he to carry me into the Subterraneous Apartment and perhaps would have done it had it not been for the Impartiality of this Gentleman pointing to  Polybius  who was the only Person except my own Countrymen that was willing to conduct me hither  The  Carthaginian  took his Seat and  Pompey  en∣tered with great Dignity in his own Person and preceded by several Historians  Lucan  the Poet was at the Head of them who observing  Homer  and  Virgil  at the Table was going to sit down himself had not the latter whisper'd him That whatever Pretence he might otherwise have had he forfeit∣ed his Claim to it by coming in as one of the Hi∣storians  Lucan  was so exasperated with the Re∣pulse that he muttered something to himself and was heard to say That since he could not have a Seat among them himself he would bring in one who alone had more Merit than their whole Assembly Upon which he went to the Door and brought in  Cato  of  Utica  That great Man approached the Company with such an Air that showed he contemned the Honour which he laid a Claim to Observing the Seat opposite to  Caesar  was vacant he took Possession of it and spoke Two or Three smart Sentences upon the Nature of Precedency which according to him consisted not in Place but in intrinsick Merit to which he added That the most virtuous Man wherever he was seated was always at the Up∣per End of the Table  Socrates  who had a great Spirit of Raillery with his Wisdom could not forbear smiling at a Virtue which took so little Pains to make it self agreeable  Cicero  took the Occasion to make a long Discourse in Praise of  Cato  which he uttered with much Ve∣hemence  Caesar  answer'd him with a great deal of seeming Temper but as I stood at a great Distance from them I was not able to hear one Word of what they said But I could not forbear taking Notice That in all the Discourse which passed at the Table a Word or Nod from  Homer  decided the Controversy  After a short Pause  Augustus  appeared looking round him with a serene and affable Countenance upon all the Writers of his Age who strove a∣mong themselves which of them should show him the greatest Marks of Gratitude and Respect  Virgil  rose from the Table to meet him and though he was an acceptable Guest to all he ap∣peared more such to the Learned than the Military Worthies The next Man astonish'd the whole Ta∣ble with his Appearance He was slow solemn and silent in his Behaviour and wore a Raimens curiously wrought with Hieroglyphicks As he came into the middle of the Room he threw back the Skirt of it and discovered a Golden Thigh  Socrates  at the Sight of it declared against keeping Company with any who were not made of Flesh and Blood and therefore de∣sired  Diogenes  the  Laertian  to lead him to the Apartment allotted for Fabulous Heroes and Worthies of dubious Existence At his going out he told them That they did not know whom they dismissed that he was now  Pythagoras  the First of Philosophers and that formerly he had been a very brave Man at the Siege of  Troy  That may be very true said  Socrates  but you forgot that you have likewise been a very great Harlot in your Time This Exclusion made Way for  Ar∣chimedes  who came forward with a Scheme of Mathematical Figures in his Hand among which I observ'd a Cone and a Cylinder  Seeing this Table full I desired my Guide for Variety to lead me to the Fabulous Apartment  the Roof of which was painted with Gorgons Chimaera's and Centaurs with many other Em∣blematical Figures which I wanted both Time and Skill to unriddle The First Table was al∣most full At the upper End sat  Hercules  leaning an Arm upon his Club on his Right Hand were  Achilles  and  Ulysses  and between them  Aeneas  on his Left were  Hector Theseus  and  Jason  The lower End had  Orpheus Aesop Phalaris  and  Musaeus  The Usher seem'd at a Loss for a Twelfth Man when methought to my great Joy and Surprize I heard some at the lower End of the Table mention  Isaac Bickerstaff  But those of the upper End receiv'd it with Disdain and said If they must have a  British  Worthy they would have  Robin Hood  While I was transported with the Honour that was done me and burning with Envy against my Competitor I was awaken'd by the Noise of the Cannon which were then fired for the taking of  Mons  I should have been very much trou∣bled at being thrown out of so pleasing a Vi∣sion on any other Occasion but thought it an agreeable Change to have my Thoughts diverted from the Greatest among the Dead and Fabulous Heroes to the most Famous among the Real and the Living  The TATLER N  o    Ubi idem maximus honestissimus Amor est aliquando praestat Morte jungi quam Vitâ distra∣hi  Val Max  From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  AFter the Mind has been employ'd on Contem∣plations suitable to its Greatness it is unna∣tural to run into sudden Mirth or Levity but we must let the Soul subside as it rose by proper De∣grees My late Considerations of the ancient Heroes impressed a certain Gravity upon my Mind which is much above the little Gratifica∣tion receiv'd from Starts of Humour and Fancy and threw me into a pleasing Sadness In this State of Thought I have been looking at the Fire and in a pensive Manner reflecting upon the great Misfortunes and Calamities incident to Hu∣mane Life among which there are none that touch so sensibly as those which befal Persons who eminently love and meet with fatal Inter∣ruptions of their Happiness when they least ex∣pect it The Piety of Children to Parents and the Affection of Parents to their Children are the Effects of Instinct but the Affection between Lovers and Friends is founded on Reason and Choice which has always made me think the Sorrows of the latter much more to be pitied than those of the former The Contemplation of Distresses of this Sort softens the Mind of Man and makes the Heart better It extinguishes the Seeds of Envy and ill Will towards Mankind corrects the Pride of Prosperity and beats down  all that Fierceness and Insolence which are apt to get into the Minds of the Daring and Fortunate  For this Reason the wise  Athenians  in their Theatrical Performances laid before the Eyes of the People the greatest Afflictions which could be∣fal Humane Life and insensibly polish'd their Tempers by such Representations Among the Modern indeed there has arose a Chimerical Method of disposing the Fortune of the Persons represented according to what they call Poetical Justice and letting none be unhappy but those who deserve it In such Cases an intelligent Spectator if he is concern'd knows he ought not to be so and can learn nothing from such a Tenderness but that he is a weak Creature whose Passions cannot follow the Dictates of his Understanding It is very natural when one is got into such a Way of Thinking to recollect those Examples of Sorrow which have made the strongest Impression upon our Imaginations An Instance or Two of such you'll give me Leave to communicate  A young Gentleman and Lady of ancient and honourable Houses in  Cornwall  had from their Childhood entertained for each other a generous and noble Passion which had been long opposed by their Friends by Reason of the Inequality of their Fortunes but their Constancy to each other and Obedience to those on whom they depended wrought so much upon their Relations that these celebrated Lovers were at length joined in Mar∣riage Soon after their Nuptials the Bridegroom was obliged to go into a Foreign Country to take Care of a considerable Fortune which was left him by a Relation and came very opportunely to improve their moderate Circumstances They re∣ceived the Congratulations of all the Country on this Occasion and I remember it was a common Sentence in every one's Mouth  You see how faith∣ful Love is rewarded  He took this agreeable Voyage and sent Home every Post fresh Accounts of his Success in his Affairs Abroad but at last though he designed to return with the next Ship he lamented in his Letters that Business would detain him some Time longer from Home because he would give himself the Pleasure of an unexpected Arrival  The young Lady after the Heat of the Day walked every Evening on the SeaShore near which she lived with a familiar Friend her Hus∣band's Kinswoman and diverted her self with what Objects they met there or upon Discourses of the future Methods of Life in the happy Change of their Circumstances They stood one Even∣ing on the Shore together in a perfect Tranqui∣lity observing the Setting of the Sun the calm Face of the Deep and the silent Heaving of the Waves which gently rolled towards them and broke at their Feet when at a Distance her Kinswoman saw something float on the Wa∣ters which she fancied was a Chest and with a Smile told her she saw it first and if it came ashore full of Jewels she had a Right to it They both fixed their Eyes upon it and enter∣tained themselves with the Subject of the Wreck the Cousin still asserting her Right but promising if it was a Prize to give her a very rich Coral for the Child of which she was then big provided she might be Godmother Their Mirth soon abated when they observ'd upon the nearer Approach that it was a humane Body The young Lady who had a Heart naturally fil∣led with Pity and Compassion made many me∣lancholy Reflections on the Occasion Who knows said she but this Man may be the only Hope and Heir of a wealthy House the Dar∣ling of indulgent Parents who are now in im∣pertinent Mirth and pleasing themselves with the Thoughts of offering him a Bride they have got ready for him Or may he not be the Master of  a Family that wholly depended upon his Life There may for ought we know be half a Dozen Fatherless Children and a tender Wife now expos'd to Poverty by his Death What Pleasure might he have promised himself in the different Welcome he was to have from her and them But let us go away 'tis a dreadful Sight The best Office we can do is to take Care that the poor Man whoever he is may be decently buried She turned away when a Wave threw the Carcass on the Shore The Kinswoman im∣mediately shriek'd out Oh my Cousin and fell upon the Ground The unhappy Wife went to help her Friend when she saw her own Husband at her Feet and dropt in a Swoon upon the Bo∣dy An old Woman who had been the Gentle∣man's Nurse came out about this Time to call the Ladies in to Supper and found her Child as she always called him dead on the Shore her Mistress and Kinswoman both lying dead by him Her loud Lamentations and calling her young Master to Life soon awaked the Friend from her Trance but the Wife was gone for ever  When the Family and Neighbourhood got to∣gether round the Bodies no one asked any Que∣stion but the Objects before them told the Story  Incidents of this Nature are the more moving when they are drawn by Persons concerned in the Catastrophe notwithstanding they are often oppressed beyond the Power of giving them in a distinct Light except we gather their Sorrow from their Inability to speak it  I have Two Original Letters written both on the same Day which are to me exquisite in their diffe∣rent Kinds The Occasion was this A Gentleman who had courted a most agreeable young Woman and won her Heart obtained also the Consent of her Father to whom she was an only Child The old Man had a Fancy that they should be married in the same Church where he himself was in a Vil∣lage  in  Westmorland  and made 'em set out while he was laid up with the Gout at  London  The Bridegroom took only his Man the Bride her Maid They had the most agreeable Journey imaginable to the Place of Marriage From whence the Bridegroom writ the following Let∣ter to his Wife's Father  March  SIR  AFter a very pleasant Journey hither we are preparing for the happy Hour in which I am to be your Son I assure you the Bride carries it in the Eye of the Vicar who married you much beyond her Mother though he says your open Sleeves Pantaloons and ShoulderKnot made a much better Show than the finnikal Dress I am in However I am contented to be the Second Fine Man this Village ever saw and shall make it very merry before Night because I shall write my self from thence  Your most Dutiful Son  T D  The Bride gives her Duty and is as handsome as on AngelI am the happiest Man breathing  The Villagers were assembling about the Church and the happy Couple took a Walk in a private Garden The Bridegroom's Man knew his Master would leave the Place on a sudden af∣ter the Wedding and seeing him draw his Pi∣stols the Night before took this Opportunity to go into his Chamber and charge them Upon their Return from the Garden they went into that Room and after a little sond Raillery on the Subject of their Courtship the Lover took up a Pistol which he knew he had unloaded the Night before and presenting it to her said with the most graceful Air whilst she look'd pleased at his agreeable Flattery Now Madam repent of all those Cruelties you have been guilty of to me  consider before you die how often you have made a poor Wretch freeze under your Casement you shall die you Tyrant you shall die with all those Instruments of Death and Destruction about you with that inchanting Smile those killing Ring∣lets of your HairGive Fire said she laughing He did so and shot her dead Who can speak his Condition But he bore it so pa∣tiently as to call up his Man The poor Wretch enter'd and his Master lock'd the Door upon him  Will  said he Did you charge these Pi∣stols He answer'd Yes Upon which he shot him dead with that remaining After this amidst a Thousand broken Sobs piercing Groans and distracted Motions he writ the following Letter to the Father of his dead Mistress  SIR  I Who Two Hours ago told you truly I was the happiest Man alive am now the most miserable Your Daughter lies dead at my Feet kill'd by my Hand through a Mistake of my Man's charging my Pistols unknown to me Him I have murder'd for it Such is my WeddingDayI will im∣mediately follow my Wife to her Grave But before I throw my self upon my Sword I command my Di∣straction so far as to explain my Story to you I fear my Heart will not keep together till I have stabb'd it Poor good old ManRemember he that killed your Daughter died for it In the Article of Death I give you my Thanks and pray for you though I dare not for my self If it be possi∣ble do not curse me  The TATLER N  o    Senilis Stultitia quae Deliratio appellari solet Senum levium est non omnium  M T C  From  Tuesd Oct  to  Thursd Oct    From my own Apartment  Octob  IT is my frequent Practice to visit Places of Re∣sort in this Town where I am least known to observe what Reception my Works meet with in the World and what good Effects I may promise my self from my Labours And it being a Privi∣lege asserted by Monsieur  Montaigne  and others of vainglorious Memory That we Writers of Essays may talk of our selves I take the Liber∣ty to give an Account of the Remarks which I find are made by some of my gentle Readers upon these my Dissertations  I happen'd this Evening to fall into a Coffeehouse near the  'Change  where Two Persons were reading my Account of the Table of  Fame  The one of these was commenting as he read and ex∣plaining who was meant by this and t'other Wor∣thy as he passed on I observ'd the Person over∣against him wonderfully intent and satisfied with his Explanation When he came to  Julius Caesar  who is said to have refused any Conductor to the Table No no said he he is in the right of it he has Money enough to be welcome wherever he comes and then whispered He means a certain Colonel of the TrainBands Upon reading that  Aristotle  made his Claim with some Rude∣ness but great Strength of Reason Who can that be so rough and so reasonable It must be some Whig I warrant you There is nothing  but Party in these publick Papers Where  Pytha∣goras  is said to have a Golden Thigh Ay ay said he he has Money enough in his Breeches that is the Alderman of our Ward You must know whatever he read I found he interpreted from his own Way of Life and Acquaintance I am glad my Readers can construe for themselves these difficult Points but for the Benefit of Po∣sterity I design when I come to write my last Paper of this Kind to make it an Explanation of all my former In that Piece you shall have all I have commended with their proper Names The faulty Characters must be left as they are because we live in an Age wherein Vice is very general and Virtue very particular for which Reason the latter only wants Explanation  But I must turn my present Discourse to what is of yet greater Regard to me than the Care of my Writings that is to say the Preservation of a Lady's Heart Little did I think I should ever have Business of this Kind on my Hands more but as little as any one who knows me would believe it there is a Lady at this Time who pro∣fesses Love to me Her Passion and good Hu∣mour you shall have in her own Words  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Had formerly a very good Opinion of my self but it is now withdrawn and I have placed it upon you Mr  Bickerstaff  for whom I am not a∣shamed to declare I have a very great Passion and Tenderness 'Tis not for your Face for that I never saw your Shape and Height I am equally a Stranger to But your Understanding charms me and I'm lost if you don't dissemble a little Love for me I am not without Hopes because I am not like the tawdry gay Things that are fit only to make Bone Lace I am neither Childish young nor Beldamold but the World says a good agreeable Woman  Speak Peace to a troubled Heart troubled only for you and in your next Paper let me find your Thoughts of me  Don't think of finding out who I am for not∣withstanding your Interest in Damons they cannot help you either to my Name or a Sight of my Face therefore don't let them deceive you  I can bear no Discourse if you are not the Sub∣ject and believe me I know more of Love than you do of Astronomy  Pray say some civil Things in return to my Ge∣nerosity and you shall have my very best Pen im∣ployed to thank you and I will confirm it I am  Your Admirer  Maria  There is something wonderfully pleasing in the Favour of Women and this Letter has put me in so good an Humour that nothing could displease me since I received it My Boy breaks Glasses and Pipes and instead of giving him a Knock of the Pate as my Way is for I hate scolding at Servants I only say  Ah  Jack  Thou hast a Head and so has a Pin  or some such merry Expression But alas How am I morti∣fied when he is putting on my fourth Pair of Stockings on these poor Spindles of mine  The Fair One understands Love better than I Astrono∣my  I am sure without the Help of that Art this poor meagre Trunk of mine is a very ill Habitation for Love She is pleased to speak civilly of my Sense but  Ingenium male habitat  is an invincible Difficulty in Cases of this Na∣ture I had always indeed from a Passion to please the Eyes of the Fair a great Pleasure in Dress Add to this That I have writ Songs since I was Sixty and have lived with all the Circum∣spection of an old Beau as I am But my Friend  Horace  has very well said  Every Year takes some∣thing  from us  and instructed me to form my Pur∣suits and Desires according to the Stage of my Life Therefore I have no more to value my self upon than that I can converse with young Peo∣ple without Peevishness or wishing my self a Moment younger For which Reason when I am amongst 'em I rather moderate than inter∣rupt their Diversions But though I have this Complacency I must not pretend to write to a Lady civil Things as  Maria  desires Time was when I could have told her I had received a Letter from her Fair Hands and That if this Paper trembled as she read it it then best ex∣pressed its Author or some other gay Conceit Though I never saw her I could have told her That good Sense and good Humour smiled in her Eyes That Constancy and good Nature dwelt in her Heart That Beauty and good Breeding appeared in all her Actions When I was Five and Twenty upon Sight of one Sylla∣ble even wrong spelt by a Lady I never saw I could tell her That her Height was that which was fit for inviting our Approach and com∣manding our Respect That a Smile sate on her Lips which prefaced her Expressions before she uttered them and her Aspect prevented her Speech All she could say though she had an infinite deal of Wit was but a Repetition of what was expressed by her Form her Form which struck her Beholders with Ideas more moving and forcible than ever were inspired by Musick Painting or Eloquence At this Rate I panted in those Days but Ah Sixty Three I am very sorry I can only return the agreeable  Maria  a Passion expressed rather from the Head than the Heart  Dear Madam  YOU have already seen the best of me and I so passionately love you that I desire we may never meet If you will examine your Heart you will find that you join the Man with the Philosopher And if you have that kind Opinion of my Sense as you pretend I question not but you add to it Com∣plexion Air and Shape But dear  Molly  a Man in his Grand Climacterick is of no Sex Be a good Girl and conduct your self with Honour and Vir∣tue when you love one younger than my self I am with the greatest Tenderness  Your innocent Lover  I B  Will's Coffeehouse  October  There is nothing more common than the Weak∣nesses mention'd in the following Epistle and I believe there is hardly a Man living who has not been more or less injured by it  Land'sEnd  Oct  SIR  I Have left the Town some Time and much the sooner for not having had the Advan∣tage when I lived there of so good a Pilot as you are to this present Age Your Cautions to the young Men against the Vices of the Town are very well But there is one not less needful which I think you have omitted I had from the Rough Diamond a Gentleman so called from an honest blunt Wit he had not long since dead this Observation That a young Man must be at least Three or Four Years in  London  before he dares say  No  You will easily see the Truth and Force of this Observation for I believe more People are drawn away against their Inclinations than with them A young Man is afraid to de∣ny any Body going to a Tavern to Dinner or  after being gorged there to repeat the same with another Company at Supper or to drink excessively if desired or go to any other Place or commit any other Extravagancy proposed The Fear of being thought covetous to have no Money or to be under the Dominion or Fear of his Parents and Friends hinder him from the free Exercise of his Understanding and af∣firming boldly the true Reason which is his real Dislike of what is desired If you could cure this slavish Facility it would save Abun∣dance at their first Entrance into the World I am  SIR  Yours  Solomon Afterwit  This Epistle has given an Occasion to a Trea∣tise on this Subject wherein I shall lay down Rules when a young Stripling is to say  No  and a young Virgin  Yes  N B  For the Publication of this Discourse I wait only for Subscriptions from the UnderGra∣duates of each University and the young Ladies in the BoardingSchools of  Hackney  and  Chelsea  St James's Coffeehouse  October  Letters from the  Hague  of the th of  October N S  advise That the Garrison of  Mons  march∣ed out on the d Instant and a Garrison of the Allies marched into the Town All the Forces in the Field both of the Enemy and the Confede∣rates are preparing to withdraw into Winter Quarters  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  I Have received a Letter subscribed  A B  wherein it has been represented to me as an Enormity That there are more than ordinary Crowds of Women at the  OldBaily  when a Rape is to be try'd But by Mr  A B  's Favour I can't tell who are so much concern'd in that Part of the Law as the Sex he mentions they being the only Persons liable to such Insults Nor indeed do I think it more unreasonable that they should be inquisitive on such Occasions than Men of Honour when one is try'd for killing another in a Duel It is very natural to enquire how the fatal Pass was made that we may the better defend our selves when we come to be attack'd Several eminent Ladies ap∣peared lately at the Court of Justice on such an Oc∣casion and with great Patience and Attention stay∣ed the whole Trials of two Persons for the above∣said Crime The Law to me indeed seems a little defective in this Point and it is a very great Hard∣ship that this Crime which is committed by Men only should have Men only on their Jury I hum∣bly therefore propose That on future Tryals of this Sort half of the Twelve may be Women and those such whose Faces are well known to have taken Notes or may be supposed to remem∣ber what happened in former Trials in the same Place There is the learned  Androgyne  that would make a good Forewoman of the Pannel who by long Attendance understands as much Law and Anatomy as is necessary in this Case Till this is taken Care of I am humbly of Opi∣nion it would be much more expedient that the Fair were wholly absent For to what End can  it be that they should be present at such Exami∣nations when they can only be perplexed with a Fellowfeeling for the Injured without any Power to avenge their Sufferings It is an unne∣cessary Pain which the Fair Ones give themselves on these Occasions I have known a young Wo∣man shriek out at some Parts of the Evidence and have frequently observ'd That when the Proof grew particular and strong there has been such an universal Flutter of Fans that one would think the whole Female Audience were falling in∣to Fits Nor indeed can I see how Men themselves can be wholly unmov'd at such Tragical Relations  In short I must tell my Female Readers and they may take an old Man's Word for it That there is nothing in Woman so graceful and be∣coming as Modesty It adds Charms to their Beauty and gives a new Softness to their Sex Without it Simplicity and Innocence appear rude Reading and good Sense masculine Wit and Ho∣nour lascivious This is so necessary a Qualifica∣tion for pleasing that the loose Part of Woman∣kind whose Study it is to insnare Men's Hearts never fail to support the Appearance of what they know is so essential to that End And I have heard it reported by the young Fellows in my Time as a Maxim of the celebrated Madam  Ben∣net  That a young Wench tho' never so beauti∣ful was not worth her Board when he was past her Blushing This Discourse naturally brings into my Thoughts a Letter I had received from the virtuous Lady  Whittlestick  on the Subject of  Lucretia  From my TeaTable  Octob  Cousin Isaac  I Read your  Tatler  of  Saturday  last and was surpriz'd to see you so partial to your own Sex as to think none of ours worthy to sit at your First Table for sure you can't but own  Lucretia  as famous as any you have placed  there who first parted with her Virtue and af∣terwards with her Life to preserve her Fame  Mrs  Biddy Twig  has written me a Letter to the same Purpose But in Answer to both my pretty Correspondents and Kinswomen I must tell 'em That although I know  Lucretia  would have made a very graceful Figure at the upper End of the Table I did not think it proper to place her there because I knew she would not eare for be∣ing in the Company of so many Men without her Husband At the same Time I must own that  Tarquin  himself was not a greater Lover and Ad∣mirer of  Lucretia  than I my self am in an honest Way When my Sister  Jenny  was in her Sampler I made her get the whole Story without Book and tell it me in Needlework This illustrious Lady stands up in History as the Glory of her own Sex and the Reproach of ours and the Circumstances under which she fell were so very particular that they seem to make Adultery and Murder meritorious She was a Woman of such transcendent Virtue that her Beauty which was the greatest of the Age and Country in which she lived and is generally celebrated as the highest of Praise in other Women is never mentioned as a Part of her Character But it would be de∣claiming to dwell upon so celebrated a Story which I mentioned only in Respect to my Kins∣woman and to make Reparation for the Omission they complain of do further promise 'em That if they can furnish me with Instances to fill it there shall be a small TeaTable set apart in my Palace of Fame for the Reception of all of her Cha∣racter  Grecian Coffeehouse  October  I was this Evening communicating my Design of producing obscure Merit into publick View and proposed to the Learned that they would  lease to assist me in the Work For the same  End I publish my Intention to the World That all Men of liberal Thoughts may know they have an Opportunity of doing Justice to such worthy Persons as have come within their respective Ob∣servation and who by Misfortune Modesty or Want of proper Writers to recommend 'em have escaped the Notice of the rest of Mankind If therefore any one can bring any Tale or Tidings of illustrious Persons or glorious Actions that are not commonly known he is desired to send an Account thereof to me at  J Morphew  's and they shall have Justice done 'em At the same Time that I have this Concern for Men and Things that deserve Reputation and have it not I am resolved to examine into the Claims of such Ancients and Moderns as are in Possession of it with a Design to displace them in case I find their Titles defective The first whose Merits I shall enquire into are some merry Gentlemen of the  French  Nation who have written very ad∣vantagious Histories of their Exploits in War Love and Politicks under the Title of  Memoirs  I am afraid I shall find several of these Gentle∣men tardy because I hear of them in no Wri∣tings but their own To read the Narrative of one of these Authors you would fancy that there was not an Action in a whole Campaign which he did not contrive or execute yet if you consult the History or  Gazettes  of those Times you do not find him so much at the Head of a Party from one End of the Summer to the other But it is the Way of these Great Men when they lie be∣hind their Lines and are in a Time of Inaction as they call it to pass away their Time in wri∣ting their Exploits By this Means several who are either unknown or despised in the present Age will be famous in the next unless a sudden Stop be put to such pernicious Practices There are others of that gay People who as I am in∣formed will live half a Year together in a Gar∣ret  and write an History of their Intrigues in the Court of  France  As for Politicians they do not abound with that Species of Men so much as we but as ours are not so famous for writing as for extemporary Dissertations in Coffeehouses they are more annoy'd with Memoirs of this Na∣ture also than we are The most immediate Re∣medy that I can apply to prevent this growing Evil is that I do hereby give Notice to all Book∣sellers and Translators whatsoever That the Word  Memoir  is  French  for a Novel and to re∣quire of them That they sell and translate it ac∣cordingly  Will's Coffeehouse  October  Coming into this Place to Night I met an old Friend of mine who a little after the Restora∣tion writ an Epigram with some Applause which he has lived upon ever since and by Ver∣tue of it has been a constant Frequenter of this Coffeehouse for Forty Years He took me aside and with a great deal of Friendship told me He was glad to see me alive for says he Mr  Bick∣erstaff  I am sorry to find you have raised many Enemies by your Lucubrations There are indeed some says he whose Enmity is the greatest Ho∣nour they can shew a Man but have you lived to these Years and don't know that the ready Way to disoblige is to give Advice You may endeavour to guard your Children as you call them butHe was going on but I found the Disagreeableness of giving Advice without being asked it by my own Impatience of what he was about to say In a Word I begged him to give me the Hearing of a short Fable  A Gentleman says I who was one Day slum¦bering in an Arbor was on a sudden awakene  by the gentle Biting of a Lizard a little Anima  remarkable for its Love to Mankind He thre  it from his Hand with some Indignation an  was rising up to kill it when he saw an hug  venemous Serpent sliding towards him on the o∣ther Side which he soon destroyed reflecting afterwards with Gratitude upon his Friend that sav'd him and with Anger against himself that had shown so little Sense of a good Office  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  MY Brother  Tranquillus  who is a Man of Bu∣siness came to me this Morning into my Study and after very many civil Expressions in Return for what good Offices I had done him told me he desired to carry his Wife my Sister that very Morning to his own House I readily told him I would wait upon him without ask∣ing why he was so impatient to rob us of his good Company He went out of my Chamber and I thought seem'd to have a little Heaviness upon him which gave me some Disquiet Soon after my Sister came to me with a very Matronlike Air and most sedate Satisfaction in her Looks which spoke her very much at Ease but the Traces of her Countenance seem'd to discover that she had been lately in a Passion and that Air of Content to flow from a certain Triumph upon some Advantage obtained She no sooner sate down by me but I perceived she was one of those Ladies who begin to be Managers within the Time of their being BridesWithout letting her speak which I saw she had a mighty Incli∣nation to do I said Here has been your Hus∣band who tells me he has a Mind to go Home this very Morning and I have consented to it It is well said she for you must knowNay  Jenny  said I I beg your Pardon for 'tis you  must knowYou are to understand that now is the Time to fix or alienate your Husband's Heart for ever and I fear you have been a little indiscreet in your Expressions or Behaviour to∣wards him even here in my House There has says she been some Words but I'll be judge by you if he was not in the Wrong Nay I need not be judg'd by any Body for he gave it up himself and said not a Word when he saw me grow passionate but Madam you are perfectly in the Right of it As you shall judgeNay Madam said I I am Judge already and tell you that you are perfectly in the Wrong of it for if it was a Matter of Importance I know he has bet∣ter Sense than you if a Trifle you know what I told you on your WeddingDay that you were to be above little Provocations She knows very well I can be sower upon Occasion therefore gave me Leave to go on  Sister said I I will not enter into the Dispute between you which I find his Prudence put an End to before it came to Extremity but charge you to have a Care of the first Quarrel as you tender your Happiness for then it is that the Mind will reflect harshly upon every Circumstance that has ever pass'd between you If such an Accident is ever to happen which I hope never will be sure to keep to the Circumstance before you make no Allusions to what is pass'd or Conclusions re∣ferring to what is to come Don't show an Hoard of Matter for Dissention in your Breast but if it is necessary lay before him the Thing as you un∣derstand it candidly without being ashamed of acknowledging an Error or proud of being in the Right If a young Couple be not careful in this Point they will get into an Habit of Wran∣gling And when to Displease is thought of no Consequence to Please is always of as little Mo∣ment There is a Play  Jenny  I have formerly been at when I was a Student We got into a  dark Corner with a Porringer of Brandy and threw Raisins into it then set it on Fire My Chamberfellow and I diverted our selves with the Sport of venturing our Fingers for the Rai∣sins and the Wantonness of the Thing was to see each other look like a Daemon as we burnt our selves and snatched out the Fruit This fan∣tastical Mirth was called  SnapDragon  You may go into many a Family where you see the Man and Wife at this Sport Every Word at their Ta∣ble alludes to some Passage between themselves and you see by the Paleness and Emotion in their Countenance that it is for your Sake and not their own that they forbear playing out the whole Game in burning each others Fingers In this Case the whole Purpose of Life is inverted and the Ambition turns upon a certain Conten∣tion who shall contradict best and not upon an Inclination to excel in Kindnesses and good Offices Therefore dear  Jenny  remember me and avoid  SnapDragon  I thank you Brother said she but you don't know how he loves me I find I can do any Thing with him If you can so Why should you desire to do any Thing but please him But I have a Word or Two more before you go out of the Room for I see you do not like the Subject I am upon Let nothing provoke you to fall upon an Imperfection he cannot help for if he has a resenting Spirit he will think your Aversion as immoveable as the Imperfection with which you upbraid him But above all dear  Jenny  be care∣ful of one Thing and you will be something more than Woman that is a Levity you are al∣most all guilty of which is to take a Pleasure in your Power to give Pain It is ev'n in a Mistress an Argument of Meanness of Spirit but in a Wife it is Injustice and Ingratitude When a sensible Man once observes this in a Woman he must have a very great or a very little Spirit to over∣look  it A Woman ought therefore to consider very often how few Men there are who will regard a meditated Offence as a Weakness of Temper  I was going on in my Confabulation when  Tranquillus  entered She cast her Eyes upon him with much Shame and Confusion mixed with great Complacency and Love and went up to him He took her in his Arms and looked so many soft Things at one Glance that I could see he was glad I had been talking to her sorry she had been troubled and angry at himself that he could not disguise the Concern he was in an Hour before After which he says to me with an Air aukward enough but methought not unbecoming I have altered my Mind Brother we'll live up∣on you a Day or Two longer I reply'd That's what I have been perswading  Jenny  to ask of you but she is resolv'd never to contradict your Incli∣nation and refus'd me  We were going on in that Way which one hardly knows how to express as when Two People mean the same Thing in a nice Case but come at it by talking as distantly from it as they can when very opportunely came in upon us an honest inconsiderable Fellow  Tim Dapper  a Gen∣tleman well known to us both  Tim  is one of those who are very necessary by being very in∣considerable  Tim  dropt in at an Incident when we knew not how to fall into either a grave or a merry Way My Sister took this Occasion to make off and  Dapper  gave us an Account of all the Company he had been in to Day who was and who was not at Home where he visited This  Tim  is the Head of a Species He is a little out of his Element in this Town but he is a Relation of  Tranquillus  and his Neighbour in the Country which is the true Place of Resi∣dence for this Species The Habit of a  Dapper  when he is at Home is a light Broad Cloth with Calamanco or Red Wastcoat and Breeches  and it is remarkable that their Wigs seldom hide the Collar of their Coats They have al∣ways a peculiar Spring in their Arms a Riggle in their Bodies and a Trip in their Gate All which Motions they express at once in their Drinking Bowing or saluting Ladies for a di∣stant Imitation of a forward Fop and a Resolu∣tion to overtop him in his Way are the distin∣guishing Marks of a  Dapper  These UnderCha∣racters of Men are Parts of the sociable World by no Means to be neglected They are like Pegs in a Building They make no Figure in it but hold the Structure together and are as absolute∣ly necessary as the Pillars and Columns I am sure we found it so this Morning for  Tranquil∣lus  and I should perhaps have look'd cold at each other the whole Day but  Dapper  fell in with his brisk Way shook us both by the Hand rally'd the Bride mistook the Acceptance he met with amongst us for extraordinary Perfection in him∣self and heartily pleas'd and was pleas'd all the while he stay'd His Company left us all in good Humour and we were not such Fools as to let it sink before we confirmed it by great Chearful∣ness and Openness in our Carriage the whole Evening  White's Chocolatehouse  October  I have been this Evening to visit a Lady who is a Relation of the enamour'd  Cynthio  and there heard the melancholy News of his Death I was in Hopes that Foxhunting and  October  would have recovered him from his unhappy Passion He went into the Country with a Design to leave behind him all Thoughts of  Clarissa  but he found that Place only more convenient to think of her without Interruption The Country Gen∣tlemen were very much puzzled upon his Case and never finding him merry or loud in their Company took him for a Roman Catho∣lick and immediately upon his Death seiz'd his  French  ValetdeChambre for a Priest and it is generally thought in the County it will go hard with him next Session Poor  Cynthio  never held up his Head after having received a Letter of  Clarissa  's Marriage The Lady who gave me this Account being far gone in Poetry and Romance told me If I would give her an Epitaph she would take Care to have it placed on his Tomb which she her self had devis'd in the following Manner It is to be made of black Marble and every Corner to be crowned with weeping Cu∣pids Their Quivers are to be hung up upon Two tall Cypress Trees which are to grow on each Side of the Monument and their Arrows to be laid in a great Heap after the Manner of a Funeral Pile on which is to lie the Body of the Deceas'd On the Top of each Cypress is to stand the Figure of a Moaning TurtleDove On the uppermost Part of the Monument the God∣dess to whom these Birds are sacred is to sit in a dejected Posture as weeping for the Death of her Votary I need not tell you this Lady's Head is a little turned However to be rid of Importuni∣ties I promised her an Epitaph and told her I would take for my Pattern that of Don  Alonzo  who was no less famous in his Age than  Cynthio  is in ours  The EPITAPH  Here lies Don  Alonzo  Slain by a Wound receiv'd under  His Left Pap  The Orifice of which was so  Small no Surgeon could  Discover it  READER  If thou would'st avoid so strangs  A Death  Look not upon  Lucinda  's Eyes  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Octob  to  Thursd Octob    From my own Apartment  October  When I came Home last Night my Servant de∣livered me the following Letter  October  SIR  I Have Orders from Sir  Harry Quickset  of  Staffordshire  Bar to acquaint you That his Honour Sir  Harry  himself Sir  Giles Wheelbar∣row  Kt  Thomas Rentfree  Esq  Justice of the  Quorum Andrew Windmill  Esq  and Mr  Ni∣cholas Doubt  of the  InnerTemple  Sir  Harry  's Grandson will wait upon you at the Hour of Nine to Morrow Morning being  Tuesday  the th of  October  upon Business which Sir  Harry  will impart to you by Word of Mouth I thought it proper to acquaint you beforehand so many Persons of Quality came that you might not be surpriz'd therewith Which con∣cludes tho' by many Years Absence since I saw you at  Stafford  unknown  SIR  Your most humble Servant  John Thrifty  I received this Message with less Surprize than I believe Mr  Thrifty  imagined for I knew the good Company too well to feel any Palpitations at their Approach But I was in very great Con∣cern how I should adjust the Ceremonial and demean my self to all these great Men who per∣haps had not seen any Thing above themselves for these Twenty Years last past I am sure  that's the Case of Sir  Harry  Besides which I was sensible that there was a great Point in ad∣justing my Behaviour to the simple 'Squire so as to give him Satisfaction and not disoblige the Justice of the  Quorum  The Hour of Nine was come this Morning and I had no sooner set Chairs by the Steward's Let∣ter and  xed my TeaEquipage but I heard a Knock at my Door which was opened but no one enter'd after which follow'd a long Silence which was broke at last by Sir I beg your Par∣don I think I know better And another Voice Nay good Sir  Giles  I looked out from my Window and saw the good Company all with their Hats off and Arms spread offering the Door to each other After many Offers they enter'd with much Solemnity in the Order Mr  Thrifty  was so kind as to name 'em to me But they are now got to my ChamberDoor and I saw my old Friend Sir  Harry  enter I met him with all the Respect due to so reverend a Vegetable for you are to know that is my Sense of a Person who remains idle in the same Place for half a Century I got him with great Success into his Chair by the Fire without throwing down any of my Cups The KnightBatchelor told me he had a great Respect for my whole Family and would with my Leave place himself next to Sir  Harry  at whose Right Hand he had sate at every QuarterSessions this Thirty Years unless he was Sick The Steward in the Rear whis∣pered the young Templer That's true to my Knowledge I had the Misfortune as they stood Cheek by Jole to desire the simple 'Squire to sit down before the Justice of the  Quorum  to the no small Satisfaction of the former and Resentment of the latter But I saw my Error too late and got 'em as soon as I could into their Seats Well said I Gentlemen after I have told you how glad I am of this great Honour I am to desire  you to drink a Dish of Tea They answered one and all That they never drank Tea in a Morning Not in a Morning said I staring round me Upon which the pert Jackanapes  Nick Doubt  tipp'd me the Wink and put out his Tongue at his Grandfather Here followed a profound Silence while the Steward in his Boots and Whip proposed That we should adjourn to some Publick House where every Body might call for what they pleas'd and enter upon the Bu∣siness We all stood up in an Instant and Sir  Har∣ry  fil'd off from the Left very discreetly counter∣marching behind the Chairs towards the Door After him Sir  Giles  in the same Manner The simple 'Squire made a sudden Start to follow but the Justice of the  Quorum  whipp'd between upon the Stand of the Stairs A Maid going up with Coals made us halt and put us into such Confusion that we stood all in a Heap without any visible Possibility of recovering our Order For the young Jackanapes seem'd to make a Jest of this Matter and had so contrived by pressing amongst us under Pretence of making Way that his Grandfather was got into the Middle and he knew no Body was of Quality to stir a Step till Sir  Harry  mov'd first We were fix'd in this Per plexity for some Time till we heard a very loud Noise in the Street and Sir  Harry  asking what it was I to make them more said it was Fire Upon this all ran down as fast as they could without Order or Ceremony till we got into the Street where we drew up in very good Order and fil'd off down  SheerLane  the impertinent Templer driving us befo e him as in a String and pointing to his Acquaintance who pass'd by  I must confess I love to use People according to their own Sense of good Breeding and therefore whipp'd in between the Justice and the simple 'Squire He could not properly take this ill but I overheard him whisper the Steward That he  thought it hard that a common Conjurer should take Place of him tho' an elder 'Squire In this Order we marched down  SheerLane  at the up∣per End of which I lodge When we came to  TempleBar  Sir  Harry  and Sir  Giles  got over but a Run of the Coaches kept the rest of us on this Side the Street However we all at last landed and drew up in very good Order before  Ben Tooke  's Shop who favoured our Rallying with great Humanity From hence we proceed∣ed again till we came to  Dick  's Coffeehouse where I designed to carry 'em Here we were at our old Difficulty and took up the Street upon the same Ceremony We proceeded through the Entry and were so necessarily kept in Order by the Situation that we were now got into the Cof∣feehouse it self where as soon as we arrived we repeated our Civilities to each other after which we marched up to the high Table which has an Ascent to it inclosed in the Middle of the Room The whole House was alarm'd at this Entry made up of Persons of so much State and Rusticity Sir  Harry  call'd for a Mug of Ale and  Dyer  's Letter The Boy brought the Ale in an In∣stant but said they did not take in the Letter No says Sir  Harry  Then take back your Mug we are like indeed to have good Liquor at this House Here the Templer tipp'd me a second Wink and if I had not looked very grave upon him I found he was disposed to be very familiar with me In short I observed after a long Pause that the Gentlemen did not care to enter upon Business till after their MorningDraught for which Reason I called for a Bottle of Mum and finding that had no Effect upon them I ordered a Second and a Third After which Sir  Harry  reached over to me and told me in a low Voice that the Place was too publick for Business but he would call upon me again to Morrow Morning at my own Lodgings and bring some more Friends with him  Will's Coffeehouse  October  Though this Place is frequented by a more mixed Company than it us'd to be formerly yet you meet very often some whom one cannot leave without being the better for their Conversation A Gentleman this Evening in a dictating Manner talked I thought very pleasingly in Praise of Mo∣desty in the midst of Ten or Twelve Libertines upon whom it seemed to have had a good Effect He represented it as the certain Indication of a great and noble Spirit Modesty said he is the Virtue which makes Men prefer the Publick to their Private Interest the Guide of every honest Undertaking and the great Guardian of Inno∣cence It makes Men amiable to their Friends and respected by their very Enemies In all Places and on all Occasions it attracts Benevo∣lence and demands Approbation  One might give Instances out of Antiquity of the irresistible Force of this Quality in great Minds  Cicereius  and  Cneius Scipio  the Son of the great  Africanus  were Competitors for the Office of Praetor The Crowd followed  Cicereius  and left  Scipio  unattended  Cicereius  saw this with much Concern and desiring an Audience of the People he descended from the Place where the Candi∣dates were to sit in the Eye of the Multitude pleaded for his Adversary and with an ingenuous Modesty which it is impossible to feign repre∣sented to them how much it was to their Disho∣nour that a virtuous Son of  Africanus  should not be preferred to him or any other Man whatso∣ever This immediately gain'd the Election for  Scipio  but all the Compliments and Congratula∣tions upon it were made to  Cicereius  It is easier in this Case to say who had the Office than the Ho∣nour There is no Occurrence in Life where this Quality is not more ornamental than any other After the Battle of  Pharsalia Pompey  marching towards  Larissus  the whole People of that Place  come out in Procession to do him Honour He thanked the Magistrates for their Respect to him but desired them to perform these Ceremonies to the Conqueror This gallant Submission to his Fortune and Disdain of making any Appearance but like  Pompey  was owing to his Modesty which would not permit him to be so disingenuous as to give himself the Air of Prosperity when he was in the contrary Condition  This I say of Modesty as it is the Virtue which preserves a Decorum in the general Course of our Life but considering it also as it regards our meer Bodies it is the certain Character of a great Mind It is memorable of the mighty  Caesar  that when he was murder'd in the Capitol at the very Moment in which he expired he gathe∣red his Robe about him that he might fall in a decent Posture In this Manner says my Au∣thor he went off not like a Man that departed out of Life but a Deity that returned to his Abode  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Octob  to  Saturd Octob    Will's Coffeehouse  October  THere is nothing which I contemplate with greater Pleasure than the Dignity of humane Nature which often shows it self in all Condi∣tions of Life For notwithstanding the Degene∣racy and Meanness that is crept into it there are a Thousand Occasions in which it breaks through its Original Corruption and shows what it once was and what it will be hereafter I consider the Soul of Man as the Ruin of a glorious Pile of Building where amidst great Heaps of Rub∣bish  you meet with noble Fragments of Sculp∣ture broken Pillars and Obelisks and a Magni∣ficence in Confusion Virtue and Wisdom are continually employed in clearing the Ruins re∣moving these disorderly Heaps recovering the noble Pieces that lie buried under them and ad∣justing them as well as possible according to their ancient Symmetry and Beauty A happy Educa∣tion Conversation with the finest Spirits look∣ing abroad into the Works of Nature and Ob∣servations upon Mankind are the great Assistan∣ces to this necessary and glorious Work But even among those who have never had the Hap∣piness of any of these Advantages there are sometimes such Exertions of the Greatness that is natural to the Mind of Man as show Capaci∣ties and Abilities which only want these acci∣dental Helps to fetch them out and show them in a proper Light A Plebeian Soul is still the Ruin of this glorious Edifice though encumber'd with all its Rubbish This Reflection rose in me from a Letter which my Servant drop'd as he was dressing me and which he told me was commu∣nicated to him as he is an Acquaintance of some of the Persons mentioned in it The Epistle is from one Serjeant  Hall  of the FootGuards It is directed  To Serjeant  Cabe  in the  Coldstream  Re∣giment of FootGuards at the  RedLettice  in the  ButcherRow  near  TempleBar  I was so pleased with several Touches in it that I could not forbear shewing it to a Cluster of Criticks who instead of considering it in the Light I have done examined it by the Rules of Epistolary Writing For as these Gentlemen are seldom Men of any great Genius they work alto∣gether by Mechanical Rules and are able to dis∣cover no Beauties that are not pointed out by  Bouhours  and  Rapin  The Letter is as follows  From the Camp before  Mons  Sept  Comrade  I Received Yours and am glad your self and your Wife are in good Health with all the rest of my Friends Our Battalion suffered more than I could wish in the Action But who can withstand Fate Poor  Richard Ste∣phenson  had his Fate with a great many more He was killed dead before we entered the Trenches We had above of our Batta∣lion killed and wounded We lost Serjeants are as followeth  Jemings Castles Roach Sherring Meyrick  and my Son  Smith  The rest are not your Acquaintance I have re∣ceived a very bad Shot in my Head my self but am in Hopes and please God I shall re∣cover I continue in the Field and lie at my Colonel's Quarters  Arthur  is very well but I can give you no Account of  Elms  he was in the Hospital before I came into the Field I will not pretend to give you an Account of the Battle knowing you have a better in the Prints Pray give my Service to Mrs  Cook  and her Daughter to Mr  Stoffet  and his Wife and to Mr  Lyver  and  Thomas Hogsdon  and to Mr  Rag∣dell  and to all my Friends and Acquaintance in general who do ask after me My Love to Mrs  Stephenson  I am sorry for the sending such ill News Her Husband was gathering a little Money together to fend to his Wife and put it into my Hands I have Seven Shillings and Three Pence which I shall take Care to send her wishing your Wife a safe Delivery and both of you all Happiness rest  Your assured Friend and Comrade  John Hall  We had but an indifferent Breakfast but the Mounseer sne ver had such a Dinner in all their Lives  My kind Love to my Comrade  Hinton  and Mrs  Morgan  and to  John Brown  and his Wife I sent Two Shillings and  Stephenson  Sixpence to drink with you at Mr  Cook  's but I have heard nothing from him It was by Mr  Edgar  Corporal  Hartwell  desires to be remember'd to you and desires you to enquire of  Edgar  what is become of his Wife  Pegg  and when you write to send Word in your Letter what Trade she drives  We have here very bad Weather which I doubt will be a Hindrance to the Siege but I am in Hopes we shall be Masters of the Town in a little Time and then I believe we shall go to Garrison  I saw the Criticks prepared to nibble at my Letter therefore examined it my self partly in their Way and partly my own This is said I truly a  Letter  and an honest Representation of that chearful Heart which accompanies the poor Soldier in his Warfare Is not there in this all the Topick of submitting to our Destiny as well discussed as if a greater Man had been placed like  Brutus  in his Tent at Midnight reflecting on all the Occurrences of past Life and saying fine Things on Being it self What Serjeant  Hall  knows of the Matter is that he wishes there had not been so many killed and he had him∣self a very bad Shot in the Head and should re∣cover if it pleased God But be that as it will he takes Care like a Man of Honour as he cer∣tainly is to let the Widow  Stephenson  know that he had Seven and Threepence for her and that if he lives he is sure he shall go into Garri∣son at last I doubt not but all the good Compa∣ny at the  RedLettice  drank his Health with as much real Esteem as we do any of our Friends All that I am concerned for is that Mrs  Peggy  Hartwell  may be offended at showing this Letter because her Conduct in Mr  Hartwell  's Absence is a little enquired into But I could not sink that Circumstance because you Criticks would have lost one of the Parts which I doubt not but you have much to say upon Whether the Fami∣liar Way is well hit in this Style or not As for my self I take a very particular Satisfaction in seeing any Letter that is fit only for those to read who are concern'd in it but especially on such a Subject  If we consider the Heap of an Army utterly out of all Prospect of Rising and Preferment as they certainly are and such great Things exe∣cuted by them it is hard to account for the Mo∣tive of their Gallantry But to me who was a Cadet at the Battle of  Coldstream  in  Scotland  when  Monk  charged at the Head of the Regi∣ment now called  Coldstream  from the Victory of that Day I remember it as well as if it were Yesterday I stood on the Left of old  West  who I believe is now at  Chelsea  I say to me who know very well this Part of Mankind I take the Gallantry of private Soldiers to proceed from the same if not from a nobler Impulse than that of Gentlemen and Officers They have the same Taste of being acceptable to their Friends and go through the Difficulties of that Profession by the same irresistible Charm of Fellowship and the Communication of Joys and Sorrows which quickens the Relish of Pleasure and abates the Anguish of Pain Add to this that they have the same Regard to Fame though they do not expect so great a Share as Men above them hope for but I'll engage Serjeant  Hall  would die Ten thousand Deaths rather than a Word should be spoken at the  RedLettice  or any Part of the  ButcherRow  in Prejudice to his Courage or Ho∣nesty If you will have my Opinion then of the Serjeant's Letter I pronounce the Style to be  mixed but truly Epistolary the Sentiment re∣lating to his own Wound is in the Sublime the Postscript of  Pegg Hartwell  in the gay and the Whole the Picture of the bravest Sort of Men that is to say a Man of great Courage and small Hopes  From my own Apartment  October  When I came Home this Evening I found after many Attempts to vary my Thoughts that my Head still ran upon the Subject of the Dis∣course to Night at  Will  's I fell therefore into the Amusement of proportioning the Glory of a Battle among the whole Army and dividing it into Shares according to the Method of the Mil∣lionLottery In this Bank of Fame by an exact Calculation and the Rules of Political Arith∣metick I have allotted Ten hundred thousand Shares Five hundred thousand of which is the Due of the General Two hundred thousand I assign to the General Officers and Two hundred thousand more to all the Commissioned Officers from Colonels to Ensigns the remaining Hun∣dred thousand must be distributed among the NonCommission'd Officers and private Men According to which Computation I find Ser∣jeant  Hall  is to have one Share and a Fraction of two Fifths When I was a Boy at  Oxford  there was among the Antiquities near the Theatre a great Stone on which were engraven the Names of all who fell in the Battle of  Marathon  The generous and knowing People of  Athens  under∣stood the Force of the Desire of Glory and would not let the meanest Soldier perish in Obli∣vion Were the natural Impulse of the  British  Nation animated with such Monuments What Man would be so mean as not to hazard his Life for his Ten hundred thousandth Part of the Ho∣nour in such a Day as that of  Blenheim  or  Blareg∣nies  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Octob  to  Tuesday Nov    White's Chocolatehouse  October  I Have lately received a Letter from a Friend in the Country wherein he acquaints me That two or three Men of the Town are got a∣mong them and have brought down particular Words and Phrases which were never before in those Parts He mentions in particular the Words  Gunner  and  Gunster  which my Correspon∣dent observes they make use of when any Thing has been related that is strange and surprizing and therefore desires I would explain those Terms as I have many others for the Information of such as live at a Distance from this Town and Court which he calls the great Mints of Lan∣guage His Letter is dated from  York  and if he tells me Truth a Word in its ordinary Circu∣lation does not reach that City within the Space of Five Years after it is first stamp'd I cannot say how long these Words have been current in Town but I shall now take Care to send them down by the next Post  I must in the first Place observe That the Words  Gunner  and  Gunster  are not to be used promiscuously for a Gunner properly speaking is not a Gunster Nor is a Gunster  vice versa  a Gunner They both indeed are derived from the Word Gun and so far they agree But as a Gun is remarkable for its destroying at a Di∣stance or for the Report it makes which is apt to startle all its Hearers those who recount strange Accidents and Circumstances which have no Manner of Foundation in Truth when  they design to do Mischief are comprehended under the Appellation of Gunners but when they endeavour only to surprise and entertain they are distinguish'd by the Name of Gunsters Gun∣ners therefore are the Pest of Society but the Gunsters often the Diversion The Gunner is de∣structive and hated the Gunster innocent and laughed at The first is prejudicial to others the other only to himself  This being premised I must in the next Place subdivide the Gunner into several Branches All or the Chief of which are I think as follow  First  The Bombardeer  Secondly  The Miner  Thirdly  The Squib  Fourthly  The Serpent  And  First  Of the First The Bombardeer tosses his Balls sometimes into the midst of a City with a Design to fill all around him with Terror and Combustion He has been sometimes known to drop a Bomb in a Senatehouse and to scatter a Pannick over a Nation But his chief Aim is at several eminent Stations which he looks upon as the fairest Marks and uses all his Skill to do Execution upon those who possess them Every Man so situated let his Merit be never so great is sure to undergo a Bombardment It is further observed that the only Way to be out of Danger from the Bursting of a Bomb is to lie prostrate on the Ground a Posture too abject for generous Spirits  Secondly  The Miner  As the Bombardeer levels his Mischief at Na∣tions and Cities the Miner busies himself in ruining and overturning private Houses and parti∣cular Persons He often acts as a Spy in disco∣vering the secret Avenues and unguarded Ac∣cesses  of Families where after he has made his  roper Discoveries and Dispositions he sets sudden Fire to his Train that blows up Families scatters Friends separates Lovers disperses Kindred and shakes a whole Neighbourhood  It is to be noted that several Females are great Proficients in this Way of Engineering The Marks by which they are to be known are a wonderful Sollicitude for the Reputation of their Friends and a more than ordinary Concern for the Good of their Neighbours There is also in them something so very like Religion as may deceive the Vulgar but if you look upon it more nearly you see on it such a Cast of Censorious∣ness as discovers it to be nothing but Hypocrisy  Cleomilla  is a great Instance of a Female Miner But as my Design is to expose only the Incorrigi∣ble let her be silent for the future and I shall be so too  Thirdly  The Squib  The Squibs are those who in the common Phrase of the World are called Libellers Lampooners and Pamphleteers Their Fireworks are made up in Paper and it is observed that they mix abundance of Charcoal in their Powder that they may be sure to blacken where they cannot finge These are observed to give a Consterna∣tion and Disturbance only to weak Minds which according to the Proverb are always  more afraid than hurt  Fourthly  Serpents  The Serpents are a petty Kind of Gunners more pernicious than any of the rest They make Use of a Sort of a White Powder that goes off without any violent Crack but gives a gentle Sound much like that of a Whisper and is more destructive in all Parts of Life than any of the Materials made Use of by any of the Fra¦ternity  Come we now to the  Gunsters  This Race of Engineers deals altogether in WindGuns which by recoiling often knock down those who discharge them without hurt∣ing any Body else and according to the various Compressions of the Air make such strange Squeaks Cracks Pops and Bounces as it is impossible to hear without Laughing 'Tis ob∣servable however that there is a Disposition in a Gunster to become a Gunner and though their proper Instruments are only loaden with Wind they often out of Wantonness fire a Bomb or spring a Mine out of their natural Inclination to Engineering by which Means they do Mischief when they don't design it and have their Bones broken when they don't deserve it  This Sort of Engineers are the most unaccoun∣table Race of Men in the World Some of them have received above an Hundred Wounds and yet have not a Scar in their Bodies some have debauched Multitudes of Women who have died Maids You may be with them from Morning till Night and the next Day they shall tell you a Thousand Adventures that happened when you were with them which you know nothing of They have a Quality of having been present at every Thing they hear related and never heard a Man commended who was not their intimate Acquaintance if not their Kinsman  I hope these Notes may serve as a rough Draught for a new Establishment of Engineers which I shall hereafter fill up with proper Per∣sons according to my own Observations on their Conduct having already had one recommended to me for the General of my Artillery But that and all the other Posts I intend to keep open till I can inform my self of the Candidates having resolved in this Case to depend no more upon their Friend's Word than I would upon their own  From my own Apartment  October  I was this Morning awaked by a sudden Skake of the House and as soon as I had got a little out of my Consternation I felt another which was followed by Two or Three Repetitions of the same Convulsion I got up as fast as possible girt on my Rapier and snatch'd up my Hat when my Landlady came up to me and told me That the Gentlewoman of the next House begged me to step thither for that a Lodger she had taken in was run mad and she de∣sired my Advice as indeed every Body in the whole Lane does upon important Occasions I am not like some Artists sawcy because I can be beneficial but went immediately Our Neighbour told us she had the Day before let her Second Floor to a very genteel youngish Man who told her he kept extraordinary good Hours and was generally at Home most Part of the Morning and Evening at Study but that this Morning he had for an Hour together made this extravagant Noise which we then heard I went up Stairs with my Hand upon the Hilt of my Rapier and approached this new Lodger's Door I look'd in at the Key∣hole and there I saw a wellmade Man look with great Attention on a Book and on a sud∣den jump into the Air so high that his Head almost touched the Cieling He came down safe on his Right Foot and again flew up a∣lighting on his Left then looked again at his Book and holding out his Right Leg put it into such a quivering Motion that I thought he would have shaked it off He used the Left after the same Manner when on a sudden to my great Surprize he stooped himself incredibly low and turned gently on his Toes After this circular Motion he continued bent in that humble Posture for some Time looking on his Book After this he recovered himself with a  sudden Spring and flew round the Room in all the Violence and Disorder imaginable till he made a full Pause for Want of Breath In this Interim my Women asked what I thought I whisper'd that I thought this learned Person an Enthusiast who possibly had his first Education in the Peripatetick Way which was a Sect of Philosophers who always studied when walking But observing him much out of Breath I thought it the best Time to master him if he were disor∣der'd and knock'd at his Door I was surpriz'd to find him open it and say with great Civility and good Mien That he hoped he had not disturbed us I believed him in a lucid Inter∣val and desired he'd please to let me see his Book He did so smiling I could not make any Thing of it and therefore asked in what Language it was writ He said It was one he studied with great Application but it was his Profession to teach it and could not commu∣nicate his Knowledge without a Consideration I answer'd That I hoped he would hereafter keep his Thoughts to himself for his Medita∣tion this Morning had cost me Three CoffeeDishes and a clean Pipe He seem'd concern'd at that and told me he was a DancingMaster and had been reading a Dance or Two be∣fore he went out which had been written by one who taught at an Academy in  France  He observed me at a stand and went on to in∣form me That now articulate Motions as well as Sounds were expressed by prope Characters and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a Dance by a Letter I beseech∣ed him hereafter to meditate in a GroundRoom for that otherwise it would be impossi∣ble for an Artist of any other Kind to live near him and that I was sure several of his Thoughts this Morning would have shaken my Specta∣cles  off my Nose had I been my self at Study  I then took my Leave of this Virtuoso and re∣turn'd to my Chamber meditating on the various Occupations of Rational Creatures  The TATLER N  o    Rura mihi placeant rigui{que} in Vallibus Amnes  Flumina Arnem Sylvas{que} inglorius  From  Tuesd Nov  to  Thursd Nov    Grecian Coffeehouse  Nov  I have received this short Epistle from an unknown Hand  SIR  I Have no more to trouble you with than to desire you would in your next help me to some Answer to the Inclosed concerning your self In the mean time I congratulate you upon the Increase of your Fame which you see has extended it self beyond the Bills of Mor∣tality  SIR  THAT the Country is barren of News has been the Excuse Time out of Mind for dropping a Correspondence with our Friends in  London  as if it were impossible out of a Coffeehouse to write an agreeable Letter I am too ingenuous to endeavour at the covering of my Negligence with so common an Excuse Doubtless amongst Friends bred as we  have been to the Knowledge of Books as well as Men a Letter dated from a Garden a Grotto a Fountain a Wood a Meadow or the Banks of a River may be more entertaining than one from  Tom  's  Will  's  White  's or St  James  's I pro∣mise therefore to be frequent for the future in my rural Dates to you But for fear you should from what I have said be induced to believe I shun the Commerce of Men I must inform you That there is a fresh Topick of Discourse lately risen amongst the Ingenious in our Part of the World and is be∣come the more fashionable for the Ladies giving into it This we owe to  Isaac Bickerstaff  who is very much censured by some and as much justified by others Some criticise his Style his Humour and his Matter others admire the whole Man Some pretend from the Informations of their Friends in Town to decipher the Author and others confess they are lost in their Guesses For my Part I must own my self a professed Admirer of the Paper and desire you to send me a compleat Set toge∣ther with your Thoughts of the 'Squire and his Lucu∣brations  There is no Pleasure like that of receiving Praise from the Praiseworthy and I own it a very solid Happiness that these my Lucubrations are approved by a Person of so fine a Tast as the Author of this Letter who is capable of enjoy∣ing the World in the Simplicity of its natural Beauties This Pastoral Letter if I may so call it must be written by a Man who carries his Entertainment wherever he goes and is undoubt∣edly one of those happy Men who appear far o∣therwise to the Vulgar I dare say he is not envied by the Vicious the Vain the Frolick and the Loud but is continually blessed with that strong and serious Delight which flows from a welltaught and liberal Mind With great Re∣spect  to Country Sports I may say this Gentle∣man could pass his Time agreeably if there were not a Hare or a Fox in his County That calm and elegant Satisfaction which the Vulgar call Melancholy is the true and proper Delight of Men of Knowledge and Virtue What we take for Diversion which is a kind of forgetting our selves is but a mean Way of Entertainment in Comparison of that which is considering knowing and enjoying our selves The Plea∣sures of ordinary People are in their Passions but the Seat of this Delight is in the Reason and Un∣derstanding Such a Frame of Mind raises that sweet Enthusiasm which warms the Imagination at the Sight of every Work of Nature and turns all around you into Picture and Landskip I shall be ever proud of Advices from this Gentle∣man for I profess writing News from the lear∣ned as well as the busie World  As for my Labours which he is pleased to en∣quire after if they can but wear one Imperti∣nence out of humane Life destroy a single Vice or give a Morning's Chearfulness to an honest Mind in short if the World can be but one Virtue the better or in any Degree less vicious or receive from them the smallest Addition to their innocent Diversions I shall not think my Pains or indeed my Life to have been spent in vain  Thus far as to my Studies It will be expected I should in the next Place give some Account of my Life I shall therefore for the Satisfaction of the present Age and the Benefit of Posterity present the World with the following Abridgment of it  It is remarkable that I was bred by Hand and eat nothing but Milk till I was a Twelve∣month old from which Time to the th Year of my Age I was observed to delight in Pud∣ding  and Potatoes and indeed I retain a Bene∣volence for that Sort of Food to this Day I do not remember that I distinguish'd my self in any Thing at those Years but by my great Skill at Taw for which I was so barbarously used that it has ever since given me an Aversion to Ga∣ming In my Twelfth Year I suffered very much for Two or Three false Concords At Fifteen I was sent to the University and stayed there for some Time but a Drum passing by being a Lover of Musick I listed my self for a Soldier As Years came on I began to examine Things and grew discontented at the Times This made me quit the Sword and take to the Study of the Occult Sciences in which I was so wrap'd up that  Oliver Cromwell  had been bu∣ried and taken up again Five Years before I heard he was dead This gave me first the Re∣putation of a Conjurer which has been of great Disadvantage to me ever since and kept me out of all Publick Employments The greater Part of my later Years has been divided between  Dick  's Coffeehouse the  Trumpet  in  SheerLane  and my own Lodgings  From my own Apartment  Nov  The Evil of unseasonable Visits has been com∣plained of to me with much Vehemence by Per∣sons of both Sexes and I am desired to consider this very important Circumstance that Men may know how to regulate their Conduct in an Affair which concerns no less than Life it self For to a rational Creature it is almost the same Cruelty to attack his Life by robbing him of so many Moments of his Time or so many Drops of his Blood The Author of the following Letter has a just Delicacy in this Point and hath put it in∣to a very good Light  Octob  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Am very much afflicted with the Gravel which makes me sick and peevish I desire to know of you if it be reasonable that any of my Acquain∣tance should take Advantage over me at this Time and afflict me with long Visits because they are idle and I am confined Pray Sir reform the Town in this Matter Men never consider whether the sick Person be disposed for Company but make their Visits to humour themselves You may talk upon this Topick so as to oblige all Persons afflicted with Chronical Distempers among which I reckon Visits Don't think me a sowr Man for I love Conversation and my Friends but I think one's most intimate Friend may be too familiar and that there are such Things as unseasonable Wit and painful Mirth  It is with some so hard a Thing to employ their Time that it is a great good Fortune when they have a Friend indisposed that they may be punctual in perplexing him when he is recover'd enough to be in that State which cannot be called Sickness or Health when he is too well to deny Company and too ill to receive them It is no uncommon Case if a Man is of any Figure or Power in the World to be congratulated into a Relapse  Will's Coffeehouse  Nov  I was very well pleased this Evening to hear a Gentleman express a very becoming Indigna∣tion against a Practice which I my self have been very much offended at There is nothing said he more ridiculous than for an Actor to insert Words of his own in the Part he is to act so that it is impossible to see the Poet for the Player You'l have  Penkethman  and  Bullock  helping out  Beaumont  and  Fietcher  It puts me in Mind con∣tinued he of a Collection of antique Statues which I once saw in a Gentleman's Possession  who employ'd a neighbouring StoneCutter to add Noses Ears Arms or Legs to the maimed Works of  Phidias  or  Praxiteles  You may be sure this Addition disfigured the Statues much more than Time had I remember a  Venus  that by the Nose he had given her looked like Mo∣ther  Shipton  and a  Mercury  with a Pair of Legs that seemed very much swelled with a Dropsy  I thought the Gentleman's Observations very proper and he told me I had improved his Thought in mentioning on this Occasion those wise Commentators who had filled up the Hemi∣sticks of  Virgil  particularly that notable Poet who to make the  Aeneid  more perfect carried on the Story to  Lavinia  's Wedding If the pro∣per Officer will not condescend to take Notice of these Absurdities I shall my self as a Censor of the People animadvert upon such Proceed∣ings  The TATLER N  o    Amote quaeramus Seria Ludo  Hor  From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    Will's Coffeehouse  November  THE Passion of Love happened to be the Subject of Discourse between Two or Three of us at the Table of the Poets this Even∣ing and among other Observations it was re∣marked that the same Sentiment on this Passion had run through all Languages and Nations  Menmius  who has a very good Taste fell into a little Sort of Dissertation on this Occasion It is said he remarkable that no Passion has been  treated by all who have touch'd upon it with the same Bent of Design but this The Poets the Moralists the Painters in all their Descriptions Allegories and Pictures have represented it as a soft Torment a bitter Sweet a pleasing Pain or an agreeable Distress and have only expressed the same Thought in a different Manner  The joining of Pleasure and Pain together in such Devices seems to me the only pointed Thought I ever read which is natural and it must have proceeded from its being the universal Sense and Experience of Mankind that they have all spoken of it in the same Manner I have in my own Reading remarked an Hundred and Three Epigrams Fifty Odes and Ninety one Sentences tending to this sole Purpose  It is certain there is no other Passion which does produce such contrary Effects in so great a Degree  But this may be said for Love that if you st  ve out of the Soul Life would be insipid and our Being but half animated Humane Na∣ture would  nk into Deadness and Lethargy it not quickned with some active Principle and as for all others whether Ambition Envy or Ava∣rice which are apt to possess the Mind in the Ab∣sence or this Passion it must be allowed that they have greater Pains without the Compensa∣tion of such exquisite Pleasures as those we find in Love The great Skill is to heighten the Sa∣tisfactions and deaden the Sorrows of it which has been the End of many of my Labours and shall continue to be so for the Service of the World in general and in Particular of the Fair Sex who a  always the best or the worst Part of it It is pity that a Passion which has in it a Ca∣pacity of making Life happy should not be cul∣tivated to the utmost Advantage Reason Pru∣dence and good Nature rightly applied can throughly accomplish this great End provided they have always a real and constant Love to  work upon But this Subject I shall treat more at large in the History of my married Sister and in the mean Time shall conclude my Reflection on the Pains and Pleasures which attend this Passion with one of the finest Allegories which I think I have ever read It is invented by the Divine  Plato  and to shew the Opinion he him∣self had of it ascribed by him to his admir'd  So∣crates  whom he represents as discoursing with his Friends and giving the History of Love in the following Manner  At the Birth of  Beauty  says he there was a great Feast made and many Guests invited A∣mong the rest was the God  Plenty  who was the Son of the Goddess  Prudence  and inherited ma∣ny of his Mother's Virtues After a full Enter∣tainment he retired into the Garden of  Jupiter  which was hung with a great Variety of Ambro∣sial Fruits and seems to have been a very proper Retreat for such a Guest In the mean Time an unhappy Female called  Poverty  having heard of this great Feast repaired to it in Hopes of finding Relief The first Place she lights upon was  Jupiter  's Garden which generally stands open to People of all Conditions  Poverty  en∣ters and by Chance finds the God  Plenty  asleep in it She was immediately fired with his Charms laid her self down by his Side and managed Matters so well that she conceived a Child by him The World was very much in Suspence upon the Occasion and could not ima∣gine to themselves what would be the Nature of an Infant that was to have its Original from Two such Parents At the last the Child appears and who should it be but  Love  This Infant grew up and proved in all his Behaviour what he really was a Compound of opposite Beings As he is the Son of  Plenty  who was the Offspring of  Prudence  he is subtle intriguing full of Strata∣gems and Devices as the Son of  Poverty  he is  fawning begging serenading delighting to lie at a Threshold or beneath a Window By the Father he is audacious full of Hopes conscious of Merit and therefore quick of Resentment By the Mother he his doubtful timorous mean∣spirited fearful of offending and abject in Sub∣missions In the same Hour you may see him transported with Raptures talking of immortal Pleasures and appearing satisfied as a God and immediately after as the mortal Mother prevails in his Composition you behold him pining lan∣guishing despairing dying  I have been always wonderfully delighted with Fables Allegories and the like Inventions which the politest and the best Instructors of Mankind have always made Use of They take off from the Severity of Instruction and enforce it at the same Time that they conceal it The supposing  Love  to be conceived immediately after the Birth of  Beauty  the Parentage of  Plenty  and the In∣consistency of this Passion with its self so natu∣rally derived to it are great MasterStrokes in this Fable and if they fell into good Hands might furnish out a more pleasing Canto than any in  Spencer  From my own Apartment  November  I came Home this Evening in a very pensive Mood and to divert me took up a Volume of  Shakespear  where I chanced to cast my Eye up∣on a Part in the Tragedy of  Richard the Third  which filled my Mind with a very agreeable Hor∣ror It was the Scene in which that bold but wicked Prince is represented as sleeping in his Tent the Night before the Battle in which he fell The Poet takes that Occasion to set be∣fore him in a Vision a terrible Assembly of Appa∣ritions the Ghosts of all those innocent Persons whom he is said to have murther'd Prince  Ed∣ward Henry  VI the Duke of  Clarence Rivers Gray  and  Vaughan  Lord  Hastings  the Two  young Princes Sons to  Edward  IV his own Wife and the Duke of  Buckingham  rise up in their Blood before him beginning their Speeches with that dreadful Salutation  Let me sit heavy on thy Soul to Morrow  and concluding with that dismal Sentence  Despair and die  This inspires the Ty∣rant with a Dream of his past Guilt and of the approaching Vengeance He anticipates the fa∣tal Day of  Bosworth  fancies himself dismounted weltring in his own Blood and in the Agonies of Despair before he is throughly awake starts up with the following Speech  Give me another HorseBind up my Wounds  Have Mercy JesuSoft I did but dream  Oh Coward Conscience How dost thou afflict me  The Lights burn blue Is it not dead Midnight  Cold fearful Drops stand on my trembling Flesh  What do I fear My self  c  A Scene written with so great Strength of Ima∣gination indisposed me from further reading and threw me into a deep Contemplation I be∣gan to reflect upon the different Ends of good and bad Kings and as this was the BirthDay of our late Renouned Monarch I could not forbear thinking on the Departure of that excellent Prince whose Life was crowned with Glory and his Death with Peace I let my Mind go so fat into this Thought as to imagine to my self what might have been the Vision of his departing Slumbers He might have seen Confederate Kings applauding him in different Languages Slaves that had been bound in Fetters lifting up their Hands and blessing him and the Persecuted in their several Forms of Worship imploring Comfort on his last Moments The Reflection upon this excellent Prince's Mortality had been a very melancholy Entertainment to me had I not been relieved by the Consideration of the glori∣ous Reign which succeeds it  We now see as great a Virtue as ever was on the  British  Throne surrounded with all the Beau∣ty of Success Our Nation may not only boast of a long Series of great regular and welllaid Designs but also of Triumphs and Victories while we have the Happiness to see our Sovereign exercise that true Policy which tends to make a Kingdom great and happy and at the same Time enjoy the good and glorious Effect of it  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  I Was very much surprized this Evening with a Visit from one of the Top Toasts of the Town who came privately in a Chair and bolt∣ed into my Room while I was reading a Chap∣ter of  Agrippa  upon the Occult Sciences but as she entered with all the Air and Bloom that Na∣ture ever bestowed on Woman I threw down the Conjurer and met the Charmer I had no sooner placed her at my Right Hand by the Fire but she opened to me the Reason of her Visit  'Mr  Bickerstaff  said the fine Creature I have been your Correspondent some Time though I never saw you before I have writ by the Name of  Maria  You have told me you were too far gone in Life to think of Love therefore I am answered as to the Passion I spoke of and con∣tinued she smiling I will not stay till you grow young again as you Men never fail to do in your Dotage but am come to consult you a∣bout disposing of my self to another My Per∣son you see my Fortune is very considerable but I am at present under much Perplexity how  to act in a great Conjuncture I have Two Lovers  Crassus  and  Lorio Crassus  is prodigiously rich but has no one distinguishing Quality tho' at the same Time he is not remarkable on the de∣fective Side  Lorio  has travelled is wellbred pleasant in Discourse discreet in his Conduct a∣greeable in his Person and with all this he has a Competency of Fortune without Superfluity When I consider  Lorio  my Mind is filled with an Idea of the great Satisfactions of a pleasant Con∣versation When I think of  Crassus  my Equi∣page numerous Servants gay Liveries and va∣rious Dresses are opposed to the Charms of his Rival In a Word when I cast my Eyes upon  Lorio  I forget and despise Fortune when I be∣hold  Crassus  I think only of pleasing my Vanity and injoying an uncontrouled Expence in all the Pleasures of Life except Love'  She paused here  Madam said I I am confident you have not stated your Case with Sincerity and that there is some secret Pang which you have concealed from me For I see by your Aspect the Generosity of your Mind and that open ingenuous Air lets me know that you have too great a Sense of the ge∣nerous Passion of Love to prefer the Ostentation of Life in the Arms of  Crassus  to the Entertain∣ments and Conveniencies of it in the Company of your beloved  Lorio  for so he is indeed Madam You speak his Name with a different Accent from the rest of your Discourse The Idea his Image raises in you gives new Life to your Fea∣tures and new Grace to your Speech Nay blush not Madam there is no Dishonour in lo∣ving a Man of Merit I assure you I am grieved at this dallying with your self when you put another in Competition with him for no other Reason but superior Wealth  'To tell you then said she the Bottom of my Heart there's  Clo∣tilda  lies by and plants her self in the Way of  Crassus  and I am confident will snap him if I re∣fuse  him I cannot bear to think that she will shine above me When our Coaches meet to see her Chariot hung behind with Four Footmen and mine with but Two Hers powder'd gay and sawcy kept only for Show mine a Cou∣ple of careful Rogues that are good for some∣thing I own I cannot bear that  Clotilda  should be in all the Pride and Wantonness of Wealth and I only in the Ease and Affluence of it'  Here I interrupted Well Madam now I see your whole Affliction you could be happy but that you fear another would be happier Or rather you could be solidly happy but that another is to be happy in Appearance This is an Evil which you must get over or never know Happiness We will put the Case Madam that you married  Cras∣sus  and she  Lorio  She answer'd Speak not of itI could tear her Eyes out at the Mention of it Well then I pronounce  Lorio  to be the Man but I must tell you that what we call Settling in the World is in a Kind leaving it and you must at once resolve to keep your Thoughts of Happi∣ness within the Reach of your Fortune and not measure it by Comparison with others  But indeed Madam when I behold that beau∣teous Form of yours and consider the Generali∣ty of your Sex as to their Disposal of themselves in Marriage or their Parents doing it for them without their own Approbation I cannot but look upon all such Matches as the most impudent Pro∣stitutions Do but observe when you are at a Play the familiar Wenches that sit laughing a∣mong the Men These appear detestable to you in the Boxes Each of them would give up her Person for a Guinea and some of you would take the worst there for Life for Twenty Thou∣sand If so How do you differ but in Price As to the Circumstance of Marriage I take that to be hardly an Alteration of the Case for Wed∣lock is but a more solemn Prostitution where  there is not an Union of Minds You would hardly believe it but there have been Designs even upon me  A Neighbour in this very Lane who knows I have by leading a very wary Life laid up a little Money had a great Mind to marry me tohis Daugh∣ter I was frequently invited to their Table The Girl was always very pleasant and agreeable After Dinner Miss  Molly  would be sure to fill my Pipe for me and put more Sugar than ordinary into my Coffee for she was sure I was goodnaturedIf I chanced to hem the Mother would applaud my Vigour and has often said on that Occasion I wonder Mr  Bickerstaff  you don't marry I am sure you would have Children Things went so far that my Mistress presented me with a Wrought Nightcap and a Laced Band of her own Working I began to think of it in earnest but one Day having an Occasion to ride to  Islington  as Two or Three People were lifting me upon my Pad I spied her at a convenient Distance laughing at her Lover with a Parcel of Romps of her Acquain∣tance One of them who I suppose had the same Design upon me told me she said Do you see how briskly my old Gentleman mounts This made me cut off my Amour and to reflect with my self that no married Life could be so unhappy as where the Wife proposes no other Advantage from her Husband than that of making her self fine and keeping her out of the Dirt  My fair Client burst out a laughing at the Ac∣count I gave her of my Escape and went away seemingly convinced of the Reasonableness of my Discourse to her  Assoon as she was gone my Maid brought up the following Epistle which by the Style and the Description she gave of the Person I suppose was left by  Nick Doubt  Harkee said he Girl tell old  Baskethilt  I would have him answer it by the first Opportunity What he says is this  Isaac  YOU seem a very honest Fellow therefore pray tell me Did not you write that Letter in Praise of the 'Squire and his Lucubrations your self  c  The greatest Plague of Coxcombs is that they often break upon you with an impertinent Piece of good Sense as this Jackanapes has hit me in a right Place enough I must confess I am as likely to play such a Trick as another but that Letter he speaks of was really genuine When I first set up I thought it fair enough to let my self know from all Parts that my Works were wonderfully enquired for and were become the Diversion as well as Instruction of all the choice Spirits in every County of  Great Britain  I do not doubt but the more Intelligent of my Readers found it before this  Jackanapes  I can call him no bet∣ter took upon him to observe upon my Style and my Baskethilt A very pleasant Gentleman of my Acquaintance told me one Day a Story of this Kind of Falshood and Vanity in an Author  Maevius  showed him a Paper of Verses which he said he had received that Morning by the PennyPost from an unknown Hand My Friend admired them extremely Sir said he this must come from a Man that's eminent You see Fire Life and Spirit run through the Whole and at the same time a Correctness which shows he is used to Writing Pray Sir read them over again He begins again Title and all  To  Mae∣vius  on his Incomparable Poems  The second Reading was performed with much more Vehe∣mence and Action than the former after which my Friend fell into downright RapturesWhy they are truly sublime There is Energy in this Line Description in that Why 'tis the Thing it self This is perfect Picture  Maevius  could bear no more but Faith says he  Ned  to tell you the plain Truth I writ them my self  There goes just such another Story of the same paternal Tenderness in  Bavius  an ingenious Con∣temporary of mine who had writ several Come∣dies which were rejected by the Players This my Friend  Bavius  took for Envy and therefore prevailed upon a Gentleman to go with him to the Playhouse and gave him a new Play of his desiring he would personate the Author and read it to baffle the Spite of the Actors The Friend consented and to reading they went They had not gone over Three Similies before  Roscius  the Player made the ActingAuthor stop and desired to know What he meant by such a Rapture And how it came to pass that in this Condition of the Lover instead of acting according to his Circumstances he spent his Time in considering what his present State was like That is very true says the MockAuthor I believe we had as good strike these Lines out By your Leave says  Maevius  you shall not spoil your Play you are too modest those very Lines for ought I know are as good as any in your Play and they shall stand Well they go on and the Particle  and  stood unfortunately at the End of a Verse and was made to rhime to the Word  stand  This  Ros∣cius  excepted against The new Poet gave up that too and said he would not dispute for a MonosyllableFor a Monosyllable says the real Author I can assure you a Monosyllable may be of as great Force as a Word of Ten Syllables I tell you Sir  and  is the Connexion of the Matter in that Place without that Word you may put all that follows into any other Play as well as this Besides if you leave it out it will look as if you had put it in only for the Sake of the Rhime  Roscius  persisted assuring the Gentle∣man that it was impossible to speak it but the  and  must be lost so it might as well be blotted  out  Bavius  snatched his Play out of their Hands said they were both Blockheads and went off repeating a Couplet because he would not make his  Exit  irregularly A witty Man of these Days compared this true and feigned Poet to the con∣tending Mothers before  Solomon  The true One was easily discovered from the Pretender by re∣fusing to see his Offspring dissected  The TATLER N  o    Falsus Honor juvat mendax Infamia terret  Quem nisi mendosum mendacem  Hor  From  Tuesd Nov  to  Thursd Nov    White's Chocolatehouse  Nov  I Know no Manner of Speaking so offensive as that of giving Praise and closing it with an Exception which proceeds where Men do not do it to introduce Malice and make Calumny more effectual from the common Error of consi∣dering Man as a perfect Creature But if we rightly examine Things we shall find that there is a Sort of Oeconomy in Providence that one shall excel where another is defective in order to make Men more useful to each other and mix them in Society This Man having this Talent and that Man another is as necessary in Conver∣sation as one professing one Trade and another another is beneficial in Commerce The happi∣est Climate does not produce all Things and it was so ordered that one Part of the Earth should want the Product of another for uniting Man∣kind in a general Correspondence and good Un∣derstanding It is therefore Want of good Sense as well as good Nature to say  simplicius  has a  better Judgment but not so much Wit as  La∣tius  for that these have not each other's Capaci∣ties is no more a Diminution to either than if you should say  Simplicius  is not  Latius  or  Latius  not  Simplicius  The Heathen World had so little Notion that Perfection was to be expected amongst Men that among them any one Quality or En∣dowment in an Heroick Degree made a God  Hercules  had Strength but it was never objected to him that he wanted Wit  apollo  presided over Wit and it was never asked whether he had Strength We hear no Exceptions against the Beauty of  Minerva  or the Wisdom of  Venus  These wise Heathens were glad to immortalize any one serviceable Gift and overlook all Imper∣fections in the Person who had it But with us it is far otherwise for we reject many eminent Virtues if they are accompanied with one appa∣rent Weakness The reflecting after this Man∣ner made me account for the strange Delight Men take in reading Lampoons and Scandal with which the Age abounds and of which I receive frequent Complaints Upon mature Considera∣tion I find it is principally for this Reason that the worst of Mankind the Libellers receive so much Encouragement in the World The low Race of Men take a secret Pleasure in finding an eminent Character levelled to their Condition by a Report of its Defects and keep themselves in Countenance though they are excelled in a thou∣sand Virtues if they believe they have in com∣mon with a great Person any one Fault The Libeller falls in with this Humour and gratifies this Baseness of Temper which is naturally an Enemy to extraordinary Merit It is from this that Libel and Satyr are promiscuously joined to∣gether in the Notions of the Valgar though the Satyrist and Libeller differ as much as the Magi∣strate and the Murderer In the Consideration of Humane Life the Satyrist never falls upon Per∣sons  who are not glaringly faulty and the Libel∣ler on none but who are conspicuously commen∣dable Were I to expose any Vice in a good or great Man it should certainly be by correcting it in some one where that Crime was the most distinguishing Part of the Character as Pages are chastized for the Admonition of Princes When it is performed otherwise the Vicious are kept in Credit by placing Men of Merit in the same Accusation But all the Pasquils Lam∣poons and Libels we meet with nowadays are a Sort of playing with the Four and twenty Letters and throwing them into Names and Characters without Sense Truth or Wit In this Case I am in great Perplexity to know whom they mean and should be in Distress for those they abuse if I did not see their Judgment and Ingenuity in those they commend This is the true Way of examining a Libel and when Men consider that no one Man living thinks the bet∣ter of their Heroes and Patrons for the Panegy∣rick given 'em none can think themselves les∣sen'd by their Invective The Hero or Patron in a Libel is but a Scavenger to carry off the Dirt and by that very Employment is the filthiest Creature in the Street Dedications and Panegy∣ricks are frequently ridiculous let them be ad∣dressed where they will but at the Front or in the Body of a Libel to commend a Man is say∣ing to the Persons applauded  My Lord or Sir I have pulled down all Men that the rest of the World think Great and Honourable and here is a clear Stage you may as you please be valiant or wise you may choose to be on the Military or Civil List for there is no one brave who commands or just who has Power You may rule the World now it is empty which exploded you when it was full I have knocked out the Brains of all whom Mankind thought good for any Thing and I doubt not but you will reward that Invention which sound out  the only Expedient to make your Lordship or your Worship of any Consideration  Had I the Honour to be in a Libel and had escaped the Approbation of the Author I should look upon it exactly in this Manner But tho' it is a Thing thus perfectly indifferent who is ex∣alted or debased in such Performances yet it is not so with Relation to the Authors of them therefore I shall for the good of my Country hereafter take upon me to punish these Wretches What is already pass'd may die away according to its Nature and continue in its present Oblivi∣on but for the future I shall take Notice of such Enemies to Honour and Virtue and pre∣serve them to immortal Infamy Their Names shall give fresh Offence many Ages hence and be detected a Thousand Years after the Commission of their Crime It shall not avail that these Children of Infamy publish their Works under seigned Names or under none at all for I am  perfectly well acquainted with the Styles of all my Contemporaries that I shall not fail of do∣ing them Justice with their proper Names and at their full Length Let therefore these Mis∣creants enjoy their present Act of Oblivion and take Care how they offend hereafter  But to avert our Eyes from such Objects it is  thinks but requisite to settle our Opinion in the Case of Praise and Blame and I believe the on∣ly  Way to cure that Sensibility of Reproach  hich is a common Weakness with the most vir∣tuous Men is to fix their Regard firmly upon on∣ly what is strictly true in Relation to their Ad∣vantage as well as Diminution For if I am pleased with Commendation which I do not de∣serve I shall from the same Temper be concern'd at Scandal I do not deserve But he that can think of false Applause with as much Contempt as false Detraction will certainly be prepared for all Adventures and will become all Occasions  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    Will's Coffeehouse  November  THE  French  Humour of writing Epistles and publishing their fulsome Compliments to each other is a Thing I frequently complain of in this Place It is methinks from the Preva∣lence of this silly Custom that there is so little Instruction in the Conversation of our distant Friends For which Reason during the whole Course of my Life I have desired my Acquain∣tance when they write to me rather to say something which should make me wish my self with them than make me Compliments that they wished themselves with me By this Means I have by me a Collection of Letters from most Parts of the World which are as naturally of the Growth of the Place as any Herb Tree or Plant of the Soil This I take to be the proper Use of an Epistolary Commerce To desire to know how  Damon  goes on with his Courtship to  Silvia  or how the Wine tasts at the  Old Devil  are threadbare Subjects and cold Treats which our absent Friends might have given us without go∣ing out of Town for 'em A Friend of mine who went to travel used me far otherwise for he gave me a Prospect of the Place or an Account of the People from every Country through which be passed Among others which I was looking ever this Evening I am not a little de∣lighted with this which follows  Dear Sir  I Believe this is the first Letter that was ever sent you from the Middle Region where I am at this present Writing Not to keep you in Sus∣pence  it comes to you from the Top of the highest Mountain in  Switzerland  where I am now shiver∣ing among the eternal Frosts and Snows I can scarce forbear dating it in  December  though they call it the First of  August  at the Bottom of the Mountain I assure you I can hardly keep my Ink from freez∣ing in the middle of the DogDays I am here en∣tertained with the prettiest Variety of SnowPro∣spects that you can imagine and have several Pits of it before me that are very near as old as the Mountain it self for in this Country it is as last∣ing as Marble I am now upon a Spot of it which they tell me fell about the Reign of  Charlemain  or King  Pepin  The Inhabitants of the Country are as great Curiosities as the Country it self They ge∣nerally hire themselves out in their Youth and if they are MusquetProof till about Fifty they bring Home the Money they have got and the Limbs they have left to pass the rest of their Time among their native Mountains One of the Gentlemen of the Place who is come off with the Loss of an Eye only told me by Way of Boast That there were now seven Wooden Legs in his Family and that for these four Generations there had not been one in his Line that carried a whole Body with him to the Grave I believe you will think the Style of this Letter a little extraordinary but the  Rehearsal  will tell you that  People in Clouds must not be confined to speak Sense  and I hope we that are above them may claim the same Privilege Wherever I am I shall always be  SIR  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  I think they ought in those Parts where the Materials are so easy to work and at the same Time so durable when any one of their H  es comes Home from the Wars to erect his Statue  In Snow upon the Mountains there to remain from Generation to Generation  A Gentleman who is apt to expatiate upon any Hint took this Occasion to deliver his Opinion upon our ordinary Method of sending young Gen∣tlemen to travel for their Education It is certain said he if Gentlemen travel at an Age proper for them during the Course of their Voyages their Accounts to their Friends and after their Return their Discourses and Conversations will have in them something above what we can meet with from those who have not had those Advantages At the same Time it is to be observ'd that every Temper and Genius is not qualified for this Way of Improvement Men may change their Cli∣mate but they cannot their Nature A Man that goes out a Fool cannot ride or sail himself into common Sense Therefore let me but walk over  LondonBridge  with a young Man and I'll tell you infallibly whether going over the  Rialto  at  Venice  will make him wiser  It is not to be imagined how many I have saved in my Time from Banishment by letting their Parents know they were good for nothing But this is to be done with much Tenderness There is my Cousin  Harry  has a Son who is the dullest Mortal that was ever born into our House He had got his Trunk and his Books all pack'd up to be transported into Foreign Parts for no Reason but because the Boy never talked and his Father said he wanted to know the World I could not say to a fond Parent that the Boy was dull but looked grave and told him the Youth was very thoughtful and I feared he might have some Doubts about Religion with which it was not proper to go into  Roman  Catholick Countries He is accordingly kept here till he declares him∣self upon some Points which I am sure he will never think of By this Means I have prevented the Dishonour of having a Fool of our House  laughed at in all Parts of  Europe  He is now with his Father upon his own Estate and he has sent to me to get him a Wife which I shall do with all convenient Speed but it shall be such a one whose good Nature shall hide his Faults and good Sense supply 'em The Truth of it is that Race is of the true  British  Kind They are of our Country only it hurts 'em to transplant 'em and they are destroyed if you pretend to improve 'em Men of this solid Make are not to be hurried up and down the World for if I may so speak they are naturally at their Wit's End and it is an impertinent Part to disturb their Repose that they may give you only an History of their Bodily Occurrences which is all they are capable of observing  Harry  had an el∣der Brother who was tried in his Way I re∣member all he could talk of at his Return was That he had like to have been drowned at such a Place he fell our of a Chase at another he had a better Stomach when he moved Northward than when he turned his Course to the Parts in the South and so forth It is therefore very much to be considered what Sense a Person has of Things when he is setting out and if he then knows none of his Friends and Acquaintance but by their Clothes and Faces it is my Opinion that he stay at Home His Parents should take Care to marry him and see what they can get out of him that Way for there is a certain Sort of Men who are no otherwise to be regarded but as they descend from Men of Consequence and may beget valuable Successors And if we con∣sider that Men are to be esteemed only as they are useful while a stupid Wretch is at the Head of a great Family we may say the Race is suspended as properly as when it is all gone we say it is extinct  From my own Apartment  November  I had several Hints and Advertisements from unknown Hands that some who are Enemies to my Labours design to demand the fashionable Way of Satisfaction for the Disturbance my Lu∣cubrations have given them I confess as Things now stand I don't know how to deny such Invi∣ters and am preparing my self accordingly I have brought Pumps and Files and am every Morning practising in my Chamber My Neigh∣bour the DancingMaster has demanded of me Why I take this Liberty since I would not al∣low it him But I answered His was an Act of an indifferent Nature and mine of Necessity My late Treatises against Duels have so far dis∣obliged the Fraternity of the noble Science of Defencee that I can get none of them to show me so much as one Pass I am therefore obliged to learn by Book and have accordingly several Volumes wherein all the Postures are exactly delineated I must confess I am shy of letting People see me at this Exercise because of my Flannel Wastcoat and my Spectacles which I am forced to fix on the better to observe the Posture of the Enemy  I have upon my ChamberWalls drawn at full Length the Figures of all Sorts of Men from Eight Foot to Three Foot Two Inches Within this Height I take it that all the fighting Men of  Great Britain  are comprehended But as I push I make Allowances for my being of a lank and spare Body and have chalked out in every Figure my own Dimensions for I scorn to rob any Man of his Life by taking Advantage of his Breadth Therefore I press purely in a Line down from his Nose and take no more of him to assault than he has of me For to speak impartially if a lean Fel∣low wounds a fat One in any Part to the Right or Left whether it be in Cart or in Terse beyond the Dimensions of the said lean Fellow's own  Breadth I take it to be Murder and such a Mur∣der as is below a Gentleman to commit As I am spare I am also very tall and behave my self with Relation to that Advantage with the same Punctilio and I am ready to stoop or stand ac∣cording to the Stature of my Adversary I must confess I have had great Success this Morning and have hit every Figure round the Room in a mortal Part without receiving the least Hurt ex∣cept a little Scratch by falling on my Face in pushing at one at the lower End of my Cham∣ber but I recovered so quick and jumped so nimbly into my Guard that if he had been alive he could not have hurt me It is confessed I have writ against Duels with some Warmth but in all my Discourses I have not ever said that I knew how a Gentleman could avoid a Duel if he were provoked to it and since that Custom is now become a Law I know nothing but the Le∣gislative Power with new Animadversions upon it can put us in a Capacity of denying Chal∣lenges though we are afterwards hanged for it But no more of this at present As Things stand I shall put up no more Affronts and I shall be so far from taking ill Words that I will not take ill Looks I therefore warn all young hot Fel∣lows not to look hereafter more terrible than their Neighbours for if they stare at me with their Hats cocked higher than other People I won't bear it Nay I give Warning to all Peo∣ple in general to look kindly at me for I'll bear no Frowns even from Ladies and if any Wo∣man pretends to look scornfully at me I shall de∣mand Satisfaction of the next of Kin

Life As this has a very great Effect even upon the most slow and common Men so upon such as it finds qualified with Virtue and Merit it shines out in p oportionable Degrees of Excellence It gives new Grace to the most eminent Accomplish∣ments and he who of himself has either Wit Wisdom or Valour exerts each of these noble Endowments when he becomes a Lover with a certain Beauty of Action above what was ever observed in him before and all who are without any one of these Qualities are to be looked up∣on as the Rabble of Mankind I was talking after this Manner in a Corner of this Place with an old Acquaintance who taking me by the Hand said Mr  Bickerstaff  your Discourse recals to my Mind a Story which I have longed to tell you ever since I read that Article wherein you desire your Friends to give you Accounts of obscure Me∣rit The Story I had of him is literally true and well known to be so in the Country wherein the Circumstances were transacted He acquainted me with the Names of the Persons concerned  which I shall change into feigned Ones there being a Respect due to their Families that are still in Being as well as that the Names them∣selves would not be so familiar to an  English  Ear The Adventure really happened in  Denmark  and if I can remember all the Passages I doubt not but it will be as moving to my Readers as it was to me  Clarinda  and  Chloe  Two very fine Women were bred up as Sisters in the Family of  Romeo  who was the Father of  Chloe  and the Guardian of  Clarinda Philander  a young Gentleman of a good Person and charming Conversation be∣ing a Friend of old  Romeo  's frequented his House and by that Means was much in Conver∣sation with the young Ladies though still in the Presence of the Father and the Guardian The Ladies both entertained a secret Passion for him and could see well enough notwithstanding the Delight which he really took in  Romeo  's Conver∣sation that there was something more in his Heart which made him so assiduous a Visitant Each of them thought her self the happy Wo∣man but the Person beloved was  Chloe  It happened that both of them were at a Play in a Carnaval Evening when it is the Fashion there as well as in most Countries of  Europe  both for Men and Women to appear in Masks and Dis∣guises It was on that memorable Night in the Year when the Playhouse by some un∣happy Accident was set on Fire  Philander  in the first Hurry of the Disaster immediately ran where his Treasure was burst open the Door of the Box snatched the Lady up in his Arms and with unspeakable Resolution and good Fortune carried her off safe He was no sooner out of the Crowd but he set her down and grasping her in his Arms with all the Raptures of a des rving Lover How happy am I says he in an Oppor∣tunity to tell you I love you more than all  Things and of shewing you the Sincerity of my Passion at the very first Declaration of it My dear dear  Philander  says the Lady pulling off her Mask this is not a Time for Art you are much dearer to me than the Life you have pre∣served And the Joy of my present Deliverance does not transport me so much as the Passion which occasioned it Who can tell the Grief the Astonishment the Terror that appeared in the Face of  Philander  when he saw the Person he spoke to was  Clarinds  After a short Pause Ma∣dam says he with the Looks of a dead Man we are both mistaken and immediately flew away without hearing the distressed  Clarinda  who had just Strength enough to cry out Cruel  Philander  Why did you not leave me in the Theatre Crowds of People immediately ga∣thered about her and after having brought her to her self conveyed her to the House of the good old unhappy  Romeo Philander  was now pressing against a whole Tide of People at the Doors of the Theatre and striving to enter with more Earnestness than any there endeavoured to get out He did it at last and with much Diffi∣culty forced his Way to the Box where his beloved  Chloe  stood expecting her Fate amidst this Scene of Terror and Distraction She revived at the Sight of  Philander  who fell about her Neck with a Tenderness not to be expressed and amidst a Thousand Sobs and Sighs told her his Love and his dreadful Mistake The Stage was now in Flames and the whole House full of Smoke the Entrance was quite barred up with Heaps of People who had fallen upon one another as they endeavoured to get out Swords were drawn Shrieks heard on all Sides and in short no Possibility of an Escape for  Philander  himself had he been capable of making it without his  Chloe  But his Mind was above such a Thought and wholly employed in weeping condoling  and comforting He catches her in his Arms The Fire surrounds them whileI cannot go on  Were I an Infidel Misfortunes like this would convince me that there must be an Hereafter For who can believe that so much Virtue could meet with so great Distress without a following Reward As for my Part I am so oldfashioned as firmly to believe that all who perish in such generous Enterprizes are relieved from the fur∣ther Exercise of Life and Providence which sees their Virtue consummate and manifest takes them to an immediate Reward in a Being more suitable to the Grandeur of their Spirits What else can wipe away our Tears when we contem∣plate such undeserved such irreparable Distresses It was a sublime Thought in some of the Hea∣thens of old  Quae

which carries with it in the Opinion of othe s a Complication of all the Pleasures of Life and a Retreat from its Inquietudes  I am led into this Thought by a Visit I made an old Friend who was

Bickerstaff  marries a Child of any of his old Companions I hope mine shall have the Preference there's Mrs  Mary  is now Six∣teen and would make him as fine a Widow as the best of them But I know him too well he is so enamour'd with the very Memory of those who flourish'd in our Youth that he will not so much as look upon the modern Beauties I re∣member old Gentleman how often you went Home in a Day to refresh your Countenance and Dress when  Teraminta  reign'd in your Heart As we came up in the Coach I repeat∣ed to my Wife some of your Verses on her"  With such Reflections on little Passages which happened long ago we passed our Time during a chearful and elegant Meal After Dinner his Lady left the Room as did also the Children As soon as we were alone he took me by the Hand Well my good Friend says he I am heartily glad to see thee I was afraid you would never have seen all the Company that dined with you to Day again Do not you think the good Woman of the House a little alter'd since you followed her from the Playhouse to find out who she was for me I perceived a Tear fall down his Cheek as he spoke which moved me not a little But to turn the Discourse said I She is not indeed quite that Creature she was when she returned me the Letter I carried from you and told me She hoped as I was a Gentle∣man I would be employ'd no more to trouble her who had never offended me but would be so much the Gentleman's Friend as to disswade him  from a Pursuit which he could never succeed in You may remember I thought her in earnest and you were forced to employ your Cousin  Will  who made his Sister get acquainted with her for you You cannot expect her to be for ever Fif∣teen Fifteen replied my good Friend Ah You little understand you that have lived a Batche∣lor how great how exquisite a Pleasure there is in being really beloved It is impossible that the most beauteous Face in Nature should raise in me such pleasing Ideas as when I look upon that excellent Woman That Fading in her Countenance is chiefly caused by her watching with me in my Fever This was followed by a Fit of Sickness which had like to have carried her off last Winter I tell you sincerely I have so many Obligations to her that I cannot with any Sort of Moderation think of her present State of Health But as to what you say of Fifteen she gives me every Day Pleasures beyond what I ever knew in the Possession of her Beauty when I was in the Vigour of Youth Every Moment of her Life brings me fresh Instances of her Complacency to my Inclinations and her Prudence in Regard to my Fortune Her Face is to me much more beautiful than when I first saw it there is no Decay in any Feature which I cannot trace from the very Instant it was occa∣sioned by some anxious Concern for my Wel∣fare and Interests Thus at the same Time methinks the Love I conceived towards her for what she was is heightened by my Gratitude for what she is The Love of a Wife is as much above the idle Passion commonly called by that Name as the loud Laughter of Buffoons is in∣ferior to the elegant Mirth of Gentlemen Oh she is an inestimable Jewel In her Examina∣tion of her Houshold Affairs she shows a cer∣tain Fearfulness to find a Fault which makes her Servants obey her like Children and the  meanest we have has an ingenuous Shame for an Offence not always to be seen in Children in other Families I speak freely to you my old Friend ever since her Sickness Things that gave me the quickest Joy before turn now to a cer∣tain Anxiety As the Children play in the next Room I know the poor Things by their Steps and am considering what they must do should they lose their Mother in their tender Years The Pleasure I used to take in telling my Boy Stories of the Battles and asking my Girl Questions a∣bout the Disposal of her Baby and the Gossiping of it is turned into inward Reflection and Me∣lancholy  He would have gone on in this tender Way when the good Lady entered and with an inexpressible Sweetness in her Countenance told us she had been searching her Closet for something very good to treat such an old Friend as I was Her Hus∣band's Eyes sparkled with Pleasure at the Chear∣fulness of her Countenance and I saw all his Fears vanish in an Instant The Lady observing something in our Looks which shewed we had been more serious than ordinary and seeing her Husband receive her with great Concern under a forced Chearfulness immediately guessed at what we had been talking of and applying her self to me said with a Smile Mr  Bickerstaff  don't be∣lieve a Word of what he tells you I shall still live to have you for my Second as I have often promised you unless he takes more Care of him∣self than he has done since his coming to Town You must know he tells me That he finds  Lon∣don  is a much more healthy Place than the Coun∣try for he sees several of his old Acquaintance and Schoolfellows are here young Fellows with fair fullbottom'd Periwigs I could scarce keep him this Morning from going out open∣breasted My Friend who is always extreamly delighted with her agreeable Humour made her  sit down with us She did it with that Easiness which is peculiar to Women of Sense and to keep up the good Humour she had brought in with her turned her Raillery upon me Mr  Bick∣erstaff  you remember you followed me one Night from the Playhouse supposing you should carry me thither to Morrow Night and lead me into the FrontBox This put us into a long Field of Discourse about the Beauties who were Mothers to the present and shined in the Boxes Twenty Years ago I told her I was glad she had trans∣ferred so many of her Charms and I did not question but her eldest Daughter was within half a Year of being a Toast  We were pleasing our selves with this fantasti∣cal Preferment of the young Lady when on a sudden we were alarm'd with the Noise of a Drum and immediately enter'd my little Godson to give me a Point of War His Mother between Laugh∣ing and Chiding would have put him out of the Room but I would not part with him so I found upon Conversation with him though he was a little noisy in his Mirth that the Child had excellent Parts and was a great Master of all the Learning on t'other Side Eight Years old I perceived him a very great Historian in  Aesop  's Fables But he frankly declared to me his Mind That he did not delight in that Learning be∣cause he did not believe they were true for which Reason I found he had very much turned his Studies for about a Twelvemonth past into the Lives and Adventures of Don  Bellianis  of  Greece Guy  of  Warwick  the  Seven Champions  and other Historians of that Age I could not but observe the Satisfaction the Father took in the Forwardness of his Son and that these Di∣versions might turn to some Profit I found the Boy had made Remarks which might be of Service to him during the Course of his whole  Life He would tell you the Mismanagements of  John Hickathrift  find Fault with the passionate Temper in  Bevis  of  Southampton  and loved St  George  for being the Champion of  England  and by this Means had his Thoughts insensibly moulded into the Notions of Discretion Virtue and Honour I was extolling his Accomplish∣ments when the Mother told me That the lit∣tle Girl who led me in this Morning was in her Way a better Scholar than he  Betty  says she deals chiefly in Fairies and Sprights and sometimes in a Winter Night will terrifie the Maids with her Accounts till they are afraid to go up to Bed  I sat with them till it was very late some∣times in merry sometimes in serious Discourse with this particular Pleasure which gives the only true Relish to all Conversation a Sense that every one of us liked each other I went Home considering the different Conditions of a married Life and that of a Batchelor and I must confess it struck me with a secret Concern to reflect that whenever I go off I shall leave no Traces behind me In this pensive Mood I returned to my Family that is to say to my Maid my Dog and my Cat who only can be the better or worse for what happens to me  The TATLER N  o    Is mihi demum vivere frui Animâ videtur qui alique Negotio intentus praeclari Facinoris aut Artis bonae Famam quaerit  Sal  From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    From my own Apartment  Nov  IT has cost me very much Care and Thought to marshal and fix the People under their pro∣per Denominations and to range them accor∣ding to their respective Characters These my Endeavours have been received with unexpected Success in one Kind but neglected in another For though I have many Readers I have but few Converts This must certainly proceed from a false Opinion That what I write is designed rather to amuse and entertain than convince and instruct I enter'd upon my Essays with a Decla∣ration that I should consider Mankind in quite another Manner than they had hitherto been re∣presented to the ordinary World and asserted that none but an useful Life should be with me any Life at all But lest this Doctrine should have made this small Progress towards the Con∣viction of Mankind because it may appear to the Unlearned light and whimsical I must take Leave to unfold the Wisdom and Antiquity of my first Proposition in these my Essays to wit That  every Worthless Man is a Dead Man  This Notion is as old as  Pythagoras  in whose School it was a Point of Discipline That if among the  or  Probationers  there were any who grew weary of studying to be useful and re∣turned  to an idle Life the rest were to regard them as dead and upon their Departing to per∣form their Obsequies and raise them Tombs with Inscriptions to warn others of the like Mortality and quicken them to Resolutions of refining their Souls above that wretched State It is upon a like Supposition that young Ladies at this very Time in  Roman  Catholick Countries are receiv'd into some Nunneries with their Cof∣fins and with the Pomp of a formal Funeral to signifie That henceforth they are to be of no further Use and consequently Dead Nor was  Pythagoras  himself the first Author of this Sym∣bol with whom and with the  Hebrews  it was generally receiv'd Much more might be offered in Illustration of this Doctrine from Sacred Au∣thority which I recommend to my Reader's own Reflection who will easily recollect from Places which I do not think fit to quote here the forcible Manner of applying the Words Dead and Living to Men as they are Good or Bad  I have therefore composed the following Scheme of Existence for the Benefit both of the Living and the Dead tho' chiefly for the latter whom I must desire to read it with all possible Attention In the Number of the Dead I com∣prehend all Persons of what Title or Dignity soever who bestow most of their Time in Eat∣ing and Drinking to support that imaginary Existence of theirs which they call Life or in dressing and adorning those Shadows and Appa∣ritions which are look'd upon by the Vulgar as real Men and Women In short whoever resides in the World without having any Business in it and passes away an Age without ever thinking on the Errand for which he was sent hithe  is to me a Dead Man to all Intents and Purposes and I desire that he may be so reputed The Li∣ving are only those that are some Way or other  laudably employed in the Improvement of their own Minds or for the Advantage of others and even among these I shall only reckon into their Lives that Part of their Time which has been spent in the Manner abovementioned By there Means I am afraid we shall find the longest Lives not to consist of many Months and the greatest Part of the Earth to be quite unpeopled According to this System we may observe that some Men are born at Twenty Years of Age some at Thirty some at Threescore and some not above an Hour before they die nay we may observe Multitudes that die without ever being born as well as many dead Persons that fill up the Bulk of Mankind and make a better Figure in the Eyes of the Ignorant than those who are alive and in their proper and full State of Health However since there may be many good Subjects that pay their Taxes and live peaceably in their Habitations who are not yet born or have departed this Life several Years since my Design is to encourage both to join themselves as soon as possible to the Number of the Living For as I invite the former to break forth into Being and become good for some∣thing so I allow the latter a State of Refusci∣tation which I chiefly mention for the Sake of a Person who has lately published an Ad∣vertisement with several scurrilous Terms in it that do by no Means become a dead Man to give It is my departed Friend  John Par∣tridge  who conclud  s the Advertisement of his next Year's Almanack with the following Note  Whereas it has been industriously given out by  Bickerstaff  Esq  and others to prevent the Sale of this Year's Almanack That  John Partridge  is Dead This may inform all his loving Countrymen  That he is still Living in Health and they a  Knaves that reported it otherwise  J  From my own Apartment  November  When an Engineer finds his Guns have no  had their intended Effect he changes his Batte¦ries I am forced at present to take this Method and instead of continuing to write against the Singularity some are guilty of in their Habit and Behaviour I shall henceforward desire them to persevere in it and not only so but shall take it as a Favour of all the Coxcombs in the Town if they will set Marks upon themselves and b  some Particular in their Dress show to what Cla  they belong It would be very obliging in a  such Persons who

particular is their Dress Gait or Behaviour For as we old Men delight in Proverbs I cannot forbear bring∣ing out one on this Occasion  That good Wi  needs no Bush  I must not leave this Subject without reflecting on several Persons I have lately met with who at a Distance seemed very terri∣ble but upon a stricter Enquiry into their Looks and Features appeared as meek and harmless as any of my own Neighbours These are Coun∣try Gentlemen who of late Years have taken  up an Humour of coming to Town in Red Coats whom an arch Wag of my Acquaintance used to describe very well by calling them Sheep in Wolves Cloathing I have often wondered that honest Gentlemen who are good Neighbours and live quietly in their own Possessions should take it in their Heads to frighten the Town after this unreasonable Manner I shall think my self obliged if they persist in so unnatural a Dress notwithstanding any Posts they may have in the Militia to give away their Red Coats to any of the Soldiery who shall think fit to strip them provided the said Soldiers can make it appear that they belong to a Regiment where there is a Defi∣ciency in the Cloathing  About Two Days ago I was walking in the  Park  and accidentally met a Rural 'Squire cloathed in all the Types abovementioned with a Carriage and Behaviour made entirely out of his own Head He was of a Bulk and Stature larger than ordinary had a Red Coat flung open to show a gay Calamanco Wastcoat His Periwig fell in a very considerable Bush upon each Shoulder His Arms naturally swang at an unreasonable Distance from his Sides which with the Advantage of a Cane that he bran∣dished in a great Variety of irregular Motions made it unsafe for any one to walk within seve∣ral Yards of him In this Manner he took up the whole  Mall  his Spectators moving on each Side of it whilst he cocked up his Hat and marched directly for  Westminster  I cannot tell who this Gentleman is but for my Comfort may say with the Lover in  Terence  who

Country round him covered with his Army he burst out in Tears to think that not one of that Multitude would be alive a Hundred Years after For my Part when I take a Survey of this populous  City I can scarce forbear weeping to see how few of its Inhabitants are now living It was with this Thought that I drew up my last Bill of Mortality and endeavoured to set out in it the great Number of Persons who have perished by a Distemper commonly known by the Name of Idleness which has long raged in the World and destroys more in every great Town than the Plague has done at  Dantzick  To repair the Mischief it has done and stock the World with a better Race of Mortals I have more Hopes of bringing to Life those that are young than of reviving those that are old For which Reason I shall here set down that noble Alle∣gory which was written by an old Author cal∣led  Prodicus  but recommended and embellished by  Socrates  It is the Description of  Virtue  and  Pleasure  making their Court to  Hercules  un∣der the Appearances of Two beautiful Wo∣men  When  Hercules  says the divine Moralist was in that Part of his Youth in which it was natu∣ral for him to consider what Course of Life he ought to pursue he one Day retired into a Desart where the Silence and Solitude of the Place very much favoured his Meditations As he was musing on his present Condition and very much perplexed in himself on the State of Life he should chuse he saw Two Women of a larger Stature than ordinary approaching to∣wards him One of them had a very noble Air and graceful Deportment her Beauty was na∣tural and easy her Person clean and unspotted her Eyes cast towards the Ground with an agree∣able Reserve her Motion and Behaviour full of Modesty and her Raiment as white as Snow The other had a great deal of Health and Florid∣ness in her Countenance which she had helped with an artificial White and Red and endeavour'd to appear more graceful than ordinary in her Mien  by a Mixture of Affectation in all her Gestures She had a wonderful Confidence and Assurance in her Looks and all the Variety of Colours in her Dress that she thought were the most proper to show her Complexion to an Advantage She cast her Eyes upon her self then turned them on those that were present to see how they liked her and often looked on the Figure she made in her own Shadow Upon her nearer Approach to  Hercules  she stepped before the other Lady who came forward with a regular composed Carriage and running up to him accosted him after the following Manner  My dear  Hercules  says she I find you are ve∣ry much divided in your own Thoughts upon the Way of Life that you ought to chuse Be my Friend and follow me I'll lead you into the Pos∣session of Pleasure and out of the Reach of Pain and remove you from all the Noise and Disquie∣tude of Business The Affairs of either War or Peace shall have no Power to disturb you Your whole Employment shall be to make your Life easy and to entertain every Sense with its proper Gratification Sumptuous Tables Beds of Roses Clouds of Perfumes Consorts of Musick Crowds of Beauties are all in a Readiness to receive you Come along with me into this Region of De∣lights this World of Pleasure and bid Farewel for ever to Care to Pain to Business  Hercules  hearing the Lady talk after this Man∣ner desired to know her Name to which she answered My Friends and those who are well acquainted with me call me  Happiness  but my Enemies and those who would injure my Repu∣tation have given me the Name of  Pleasure  By this Time the other Lady was come up who addressed her self to the young Hero in a very different Manner  Hercules  says she I offer my self to you be∣cause I know you are descended from the Gods and give Proofs of that Descent by your Love to Virtue and Application to the Studies pro∣per for your Age This makes me hope you will gain both for your self and me an immortal Re∣putation But before I invite you into my So∣ciety and Friendship I will be open and sincere with you and must lay down this as an esta∣blish'd Truth That there is nothing truly va∣luable which can be purchased without Pains and Labour The Gods have set a Price upon every real and noble Pleasure If you would gain the Favour of the Derty you must be at the Pains of worshipping him if the Friendship of good Men you must study to oblige them if you would be honour'd by your Country you must take Care to serve it In short if you would be eminent in War or Peace you must become Master of all the Qualifications that can make you so These are the only Terms and Conditions upon which I can propose Happiness The God∣dess of  Pleasure  here broke in upon her Discourse You see said she  Hercules  by her own Confes∣sion the Way to her Pleasures is long and diffi∣cult whereas that which I propose is short and easy Alas said the other Lady whose Visage glowed with a Passion made up of Scorn and Pi∣ty what are the Pleasures you propose To eat before you are hungry drink before you are a∣thirst sleep before you are tired to gratify Ap∣petites before they are raised and raise such Ap∣petites as Nature never planted You never heard the most delicious Musick which is the Praise of ones self nor saw the most beautiful Object which is the Work of ones own Hands Your Votaries pass away their Youth in a Dream of mistaken Pleasures while they are hoarding up Anguish Torment and Remorse for old Age  As for me I am the Friend of Gods and of good Men an agreeable Companion to the Arti∣zan an Houshold Guardian to the Fathers of Fa∣milies a Patron and Protector of Servants an Associate in all true and generous Friendships The Banquets of my Votaries are never costly but always delicious for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by Hunger and Thirst Their Slumbers are sound and their Wakings chearful My young Men have the Pleasure of hearing themselves praised by those who are in Years and those who are in Years of being honour'd by those who are young In a Word my Followers are favour'd by the Gods beloved by their Acquain∣tance esteem'd by their Country and after the Close of their Labours honoured by Posterity  We know by the Life of this memorable Hero to which of these Two Ladies he gave up his Heart and I believe every one who reads this will do him the Justice to approve his Choice  I very much admire the Speeches of these La∣dies as containing in them the chief Arguments for a Life of Virtue or a Life of Pleasure that could enter into the Thoughts of an Heathen but am particularly pleased with the different Fi∣gures he gives the Two Goddesses Our modern Authors have represented Pleasure or Vice with an alluring Face but ending in Snakes and Mon∣sters Here she appears in all the Charms of Beauty tho' they are all false and borrowed and by that Means composes a Vision entirely natural and pleasing  I have translated this Allegory for the Benefit of the Youth of  Great Britain  and particularly of those who are still in the deplorable State of NonExistence and whom I most earnestly en∣treat to come into the World Let my Em∣brio's show the least Inclination to any single Virtue and I shall allow it to be a Struggling to∣wards  Birth I don't expect of them that like the Hero in the foregoing Story they should go about as soon as they are born with a Club in their Hands and a Lion's Skin on their Shoul∣ders to root out Monsters and destroy Tyrants but as the finest Author of all Antiquity has said upon this very Occasion Though a Man has not the Abilities to distinguish himself in the most shining Parts of a great Character he has certain∣ly the Capacity of being just faithful modest and temperate  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Nov  to  Thursd Nov    From my own Apartment  November  I Read the following Letter which was left for me this Evening with very much Concern for the Lady's Condition who sent it who expres∣ses the State of her Mind with great Frank∣ness as all People ought who talk to their Phy∣sicians  Mr  Bickerstaff  THough you are stricken in Years and have had great Experience in the World I believe you will say there are not frequently such difficult Oc∣casions to act in with Decency as those where∣in I am entangled I am a Woman in Love and that you will allow to be the most unhappy of all Circumstances in humane Life Nature has formed us with a strong Reluctance against own∣ing such a Passion and Custom has made it Cri∣minal in us to make Advances A Gentleman whom I will call  Fabio  has the entire Possession of my Heart I am so intimately acquainted with  him that he makes no Scruple of communicating to me an ardent Affection he has for  Cleora  a Friend of mine who also makes me her Confident Most Part of my Life I am in Company with the one or the other and am always entertained with his Pas∣sion or her Triumph  Cleora  is one of those Ladies who think they are virtuous if they are not guil∣ty and without any Delicacy of Choice resolves to take the best Offer which shall be made to her With this Prospect she puts off declaring her self in Favour of  Fabio  till she sees what Lovers will fall into her Snares which she lays in all Publick Places with all the Art of Gesture and Glances This Resolution she has her self told me Though I love him better than Life I would not gain him by betraying  Cleora  or committing such a Trespass against Modesty as let∣ting him know my self that I love him You are an Astrologer What shall I do  Diana Doubtful  This Lady has said very justly that the Condi∣tion of a Woman in Love is of all others the most miserable Poor  Diana  How must she be rack'd with Jealousy when  Fabio  talks of  Cleora  How with Indignation when  Cleora  makes a Property of  Fabio  A Female Lover is in the Condition of a Ghost that wanders about its beloved Treasure without Power to speak till it is spoken to I de∣sire  Diana  to continue in this Circumstance for I see an Eye of Comfort in her Case and will take all proper Measures to extricate her out of this unhappy Game of Cross Purposes Since  Cleora  is upon the Catch with her Charms and has no particular Regard for  Fabio  I shall place a Couple of special Fellows in her Way who shall both address to her and have each a better Estate than  Fabio  They are both already taken with her and are preparing for being of her Retinue the ensuing Winter  To Women of this worldly Turn as I appre∣hend  Cleora  to be we must reckon backward in our Computation of Merit and when a fair Lady thinks only of making her Spouse a convenient Domestick the Notion of Worth and Value is altered and the Lover is the more acceptable the less he is considerable The Two I shall throw in the Way of  Cleora  are  Orson Thickett  and Mr  Walter Wisdom Orson  is an Huntsman whose Father's Death and some Difficulties about Legacies brought out of the Woods to Town last  November  He was at that Time one of those Country Salvages who despise the Softness they meet in Town and Court and professedly show their Strength and Roughness in every Motion and Gesture in Scorn of our Bowing and Cring∣ing He was at his first Appearance very remark∣able for that Piece of good Breeding peculiar to natural  Britons  to wit Defiance and showed every one he met he was as good a Man as he But in the Midst of all this Fierceness he would sometimes attend the Discourse of a Man of Sense and look at the Charms of a Beauty with his Eyes and Mouth open He was in this Po∣sture when in the Beginning of last  December  he was shot by  Cleora  from a SideBoxFrom that Moment he softened into Humanity forgot his Dogs and Horses and now moves and speaks with Civility and Address  Wat Wisdom  by the Death of an elder Bro∣ther came to a great Estate when he had pro∣ceeded just far enough into his Studies to be very impertinent and at the Y  ars when the Law gives him Possession of his Fortune and his own Constitution is too warm for the Ma∣nagement of it  Orson  is learning to fence and dance to please and fight for his Mistress and  Walter  preparing fine Horses and a gingling Chariot to enchant her All Persons concerned will appear at the next Opera where will begin  the WildGoose Chase and I doubt  Fabio  will see himself so overlooked for  Orson  or  Walter  as to turn his Eyes on the modest Passion and be∣coming Languor in the Countenance of  Diana  it being my Design to supply with the Art of Love all those who preserve the sincere Passion of it  Will's Coffeehouse  November  An ingenious and worthy Gentleman my an∣cient Friend fell into Discourse with me this Evening upon the Force and Efficacy which the Writings of good Poets have on the Minds of their intelligent Readers and recommended to me his Sense of the Matter thrown together in the following Manner which he desired me to communicate to the Youth of  Great Britain  in my Essays which I chuse to do in his own Words  I have always been of Opinion says he that Virtue sinks deepest into the Heart of Man when it comes recommended by the powerful Charms of Poetry The most active Principle in our Mind is the Imagination To it a good Poet makes his Court perpetually and by this Faculty takes Care to gain it first Our Passions and Inclinations come over next and our Rea∣son surrenders it self with Pleasure in the End Thus the whole Soul is insensibly betrayed into Morality by bribing the Fancy with beautiful and agreeable Images of those very Things that in the Books of the Philosophers appear austere and have at the best but a kind of forbidden As∣pect In a Word the Poets do as it were strew the rough Paths of Virtue so full of Flowers that we are not sensible of the Uneasiness of them and imagine our selves in the Midst of Pleasures and the most bewitching Allurements at the Time we are making a Progress in the severest Duties of Life  All then agree that licentious Poems do of all Writings soonest corrupt the Heart And why should we not be as universally perswaded that the grave and serious Performances of such as write in the most engaging Manner by a kind of divine Impulse must be the most effectual Per∣swasives to Goodness If therefore I were blessed with a Son in order to the forming of his Man∣ners which is making him truly my Son I should be continually putting into his Hand some sine Poet The graceful Sentences and the man∣ly Sentiments so frequently to be met with in every great and sublime Writer are in my Judg∣ment the most ornamental and valuable Furni∣ture that can be for a young Gentleman's Head methinks they shew like so much rich Embroide∣ry upon the Brain Let me add to this That Humanity and Tenderness without which there can be no true Greatness in the Mind are in∣spired by the Muses in such pathetical Language that all we find in ProseAuthors towards the raising and improving of these Passions is in Comparison but cold or lukewarm at the best There is besides a certain Elevation of Soul a se∣date Magnanimity and a noble Turn of Virtue that distinguishes the Hero from the plain honest Man to which Verse can only raise us The bold Metaphors and founding Numbers peculiar to the Poets rouze up all our sleeping Facul∣ties and alarm the whole Powers of the Soul much like that excellent Trumpeter mentioned by  Virgil  Quo non praestantior alter  Aere ciere Viros Martemque accendere Cantu  I fell into this Train of Thinking this Even∣ing upon reading a Passage in a Mask writ by  Milton  where two Brothers are introduced seek∣ing  after their Sister whom they had lost in a dark Night and thick Wood One of the Bro∣thers is apprehensive lest the wandering Virgin should be overpowered with Fears through the Darkness and Loneliness of the Time and Place This gives the other Occasion to make the fol∣lowing Reflections which as I read them made me forget my Age and renewed in me the warm Desires after Virtue so natural to uncorrupted Youth  I do not think my Sister so to se  k  Or so unprincipled in Virtue's Book  And the sweet Peace that Goodness bosoms ever  As that the single Want of Light and Noise  Not being in Danger as I trust she is not  Could stir the constant Mood of her calm Thoughts  And put them into misbecoming Plight  Virtue could see to do what Virtue would  By her own radiant Light tho' Sun and Moon  Were in the flat Sea sunk And Wisdom's self  Oft seeks to sweet retired Solitude  Where with her best Nurse Contemplation  She plumes her Feathers and lets grow her Wings  That in the various Bustle of Resort  Were all too ruffled and sometimes impaired  He that has Light within his own clear Breast  May sit i'th' Center and enjoy bright Day  But he that hides a dark Soul and soul Thoughts  Benighted walks under the mid day Sun  Himself is his own Dungeon  The TATLER N  o    Spirat Tragicum satis feliciter audet  From  Thursd Nov  to  Saturd Nov    Will's Coffeehouse  November  I Have been this Evening recollecting what Pas∣sages since I could first think have left the strongest Impressions upon my Mind and after strict Enquiry I am convinced that the Impulses I have received from Theatrical Representations have had a greater Effect than otherwise would have been wrought in me by the little Occurren∣ces of my private Life My old Friends  Hart  and  Mohun  the one by his natural and proper Force the other by his great Skill and Art never failed to send me Home full of such Idea's as affected my Behaviour and made me insensibly more courteous and humane to my Friends and Ac∣quaintance It is not the Business of a good Play to make every Man an Hero but it certainly gives him a livelier Sense of Virtue and Merit than he had when he entered the Theatre  This rational Pleasure as I always call it has for many Years been very little tasted But I am glad to find that the true Spirit of it is reviving again amongst us by a due Regard to what is presented and by supporting only one Playhouse It has been within the Observation of the youngest amongst us That while there were Two Houses they did not outvie each o∣ther by such Representations as tended to the In∣struction and Ornament of Life but by introdu∣cing mimical Dances and fulsome Buffoonries For when an excellent Tragedy was to be acted  in one House the LadderDancer carried the whole Town to the other And indeed such an Evil as this must be the natural Consequence of Two Theatres as certainly as that there are more who can see than can think Every one is sensible of the Danger of the Fellow on the Lad∣der and can see his Activity in coming down safe but very few are Judges of the Distress of an Hero in a Play or of his Manner of Behaviour in those Circumstances Thus to please the People Two Houses must entertain them with what they can understand and not with Things which are design∣ed to improve their Understanding And the rea∣diest Way to gain good Audiences must be to of∣fer such Things as are most relished by the Crowd that is to say immodest Action empty Show or impertinent Activity In short Two Houses can∣not hope to subsist but by Means which are con∣tradictory to the very Institution of a Theatre in a wellgovern'd Kingdom  I have ever had this Sense of the Thing and for that Reason have rejoiced that my ancient coeval Friend of  DruryLane  though he had sold off most of his Moveables still kept Possession of his Palace and trembled for him when he had lately like to have been taken by a Stratagem There have for many Ages been a certain Learn∣ed Sort of Unlearned Men in this Nation called Attornies who have taken upon them to solve all Difficulties by increasing them and are called upon to the Assistance of all who are lazy or weak of Understanding The Insolence of a Ruler of this Place made him resign the Possession of it to the Management of my abovementioned Friend  Divito Divito  was too Modest to know when to resign it till he had the Opinion and Sentence of the Law for his Removal Both these in Length of Time were obtained against him But as the great  Archimedes  defended  Sy∣racuse  with so powerful Engines that if he threw  a Rope or Piece of Wood over the Wall the E∣nemy fled so  Divito  had wounded all Adversa∣ries with so much Skill that Men feared even to be in the Right against him For this Reason the lawful Ruler sets up an Attorney to expel an Attorney and chose a Name dreadful to the Stage who only seemed able to beat  Divito  out of his Intrenchments  On the d Instant a Night of publick Re∣joycing the Enemies of  Divito  made a Largess to the People of Faggots Tubs and other Com∣bustible Matter which was erected into a Bon∣fire before the Palace Plentiful Cans were at the same Time distributed among the Dependen∣ces of that Principality and the artful Rival of  Divito  observing them prepared for Enterprize presented the lawful Owner of the neighbouring Edifice and showed his Deputation under him War immediately ensued upon the peaceful Em∣pire of Wit and the Muses the  Goths  and  Van∣dals  sacking  Rome  did not threaten a more bar∣barous Devastation of Arts and Sciences But when they had forced their Entrance the expe∣rienced  Divito  had detached all his Subjects and evacuated all his Stores The neighbouring Inhabitants report That the Refuse of  Divito  's Followers marched off the Night before disguised in Magnificence DoorKeepers came out clad like Cardinals and Scene Drawers like Heathen Gods  Divito  himself was wrapped up in one of his black Clouds and left to the Enemy nothing but any empty Stage full of TrapDoors known only to himself and his Adherents  From my own Apartment  November  I have already taken great Pains to inspire No∣tions of Honour and Virtue into the People of this Kingdom and used all gentle Methods ima∣ginable to bring those who are dead in Idleness Folly and Pleasure into Life by applying them∣selves to Learning Wisdom and Industry But  since fair Means are ineffectual I must proceed to Extremities and shall give my good Friends the Company of Upholders full Power to bury all such Dead as they meet with who are with∣in my former Descriptions of deceased Persons In the mean Time the following Remonstrance of that Corporation I take to be very just  From our Office near the  Haymarket  Nov  Worthy SIR  UPon reading your  Tatler  of  Saturday  last by which we received the agreeable News of so many Deaths we immediately ordered in a considerable Quantity of Blacks and our Ser∣vants have wrought Night and Day ever since to furnish out the Necessaries for these Decea∣sed But so it is Sir that of this vast Number of dead Bodies that go putrifying up and down the Streets not one of them has come to us to be buried Tho' we should be loth to be any Hindrance to our good Friends the Physicians yet we cannot but take Notice what Infection Her Majesty's Subjects are liable to from the horrible Stench of so many Corpses Sir we will not detain you our Case in short is this Here are we embark'd in this Undertaking for the Publick Good Now if People shall be suf∣fered to go on unburied at this Rate there's an End of the usefulest Manufactures and Handi∣crafts of the Kingdom For where will be your Sextons CoffinMakers and Plummers What will become of your Embalmers Epi∣taphMongers and Chief Mourners We are loth to drive this Matter any further tho' we tremble at the Consequences of it For it it shall be left to every dead Man's Discretion not to be buried till he sees his Time no Man can say where that will end but thus much we will take upon us to affirm That  such a To∣leration will be intolerable  What would make us easy in this Matter is no more but that your Worship would be plea∣sed to issue out your Orders to  ditto  Dead to repair forthwith to our Office in order to their Interrment where constant Attendance shall be given to treat with all Persons according to their Quality and the Poor to be buried for no∣thing And for the Convenience of such Per∣sons as are willing enough to be dead but that they are afraid their Friends and Relations should know it we have a BackDoor into  Warwickstreet  from whence they may be in∣terred with all Secrecy imaginable and with∣out Loss of Time or Hinderance of Business But in case of Obstinacy for we would gladly make a thorough Riddance we desire a fur∣ther Power from your Worship to take up such Deceased as shall not have complied with your first Orders wherever we meet them And if after that there shall be Complaints of any Per∣sons so offending let them lie at our Doors We are  Your Worship's till Death  The Master and Company of Upholders  P S  We are ready to give in our printed Proposals at large and if your Worship ap∣proves of our Undertaking we desire the fol∣lowing Advertisement may be inserted in your next Paper  Whereas a Commission of Interrment has been a∣warded against Dr  John Partridge  Philomath Professor of Physick and Astrology and whereas the said  Partridge  hath not surrendred him∣self nor shown Cause to the contrary These are to certify That the Company of Upholders will pro∣ceed to bury him from  Cordwainers  Hall on  Tues∣day  the th Instant where any Six of his sur∣viving  Friends who still believe him to be alive are desired to come prepared to hold up the Pall  Note  We shall light away at Six in the Even∣ing there being to be a Sermon  The TATLER N  o    I am redit Virgo redeunt Saturnia Regna  Virg  From  Saturd Nov  to  Tuesd Nov    SheerLane  November  I Was last Week taking a solitary Walk in the Garden of  Lincoln'sInn  a Favour that is in∣dulged me by several of the Benchers who are my intimate Friends and grown old with me in this Neighbourhood when according to the Nature of Men in Years who have made but little Pro∣gress in the Advancement of their Fortune or their Fame I was repining at the sudden Rise of many Persons who are my Juniors and indeed at the unequal Distribution of Wealth Honour and all other Blessings of Life I was lost in this Thought when the Night came upon me and drew my Mind into a far more agreeable Con∣templation The Heaven above me appeared in all its Glories and presented me with such an Hemisphere of Stars as made the most agreea∣ble Prospect imaginable to one who delights in the Study of Nature It happened to be a freez∣ing Night which had purified the whole Body of Air into such a bright transparent Aether as made every Constellation visible and at the same Time gave such a particular Glowing to the Stars that I thought it the richest Sky I had ever seen I could not behold a Scene so won∣derfully adorned and lighted up if I may be al∣lowed  that Expression without suitable Medita∣tions on the Author of such illustrious and ama∣sing Objects For on these Occasions Philosophy suggests Motives to Religion and Religion adds Pleasures to Philosophy  As soon as I had recovered my usual Temper and Serenity of Soul I retired to my Lodgings with the Satisfaction of having passed away a few Hours in the proper Employments of a reasonable Creature and promising my self that my Slum∣bers would be sweet I no sooner fell into them but I dreamed a Dream or saw a Vision for I know not which to call it that seemed to rise out of my EveningMeditation and had something in it so solemn and serious that I cannot forbear communicating it tho' I must confess the Wild∣ness of Imagination which in a Dream is al∣ways loose and irregular discovers it self too much in several Parts of it  Methoughts I saw the same Azure Sky diversifi∣ed with the same glorious Luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell asleep I was looking very attentively on that Sign in the Hea∣vens which is called by the Name of the  Ballance  when on a sudden there appear'd in it an extraor∣dinary Light as if the Sun should rise at Midnight By its increasing in Breadth and Lustre I soon found that it approached towards the Earth and at length could discern something like a Shadow hovering in the Midst of a great Glory which in a little Time after I distinctly perceived to be the Fi∣gure of a Woman I fancied at first it might have been the Angel or Intelligence that guided the Con∣stellation from which it descended but upon a near∣er View I saw about her all the Emblems with which the Goddess of Justice is usually describ'd Her Countenance was unspeakably awful and ma∣jestick but exquisitely beautiful to those whose Eyes were strong enough to behold it her Smiles transported with Rapture her Frowns terrified  to Despair She held in her Hand a Mirror en∣dowed with the same Qualities as that which the Painters put into the Hand of  Truth  There streamed from it a Light which distin∣guished it self from all the Splendors that sur∣rounded her more than a Flash of Lightning shines in the Midst of Daylight As she moved it in her Hand it brightened the Heavens the Air or the Earth When she had descended so low as to be seen and heard by Mortals to make the Pomp of her Appearance more supportable she threw Darkness and Clouds about her that tempered the Light into a Thousand beautiful Shades and Colours and multiplied that Lustre which was before too strong and dazling into a Variety of milder Glories  In the mean Time the World was in an Alarm and all the Inhabitants of it gathered together upon a spacious Plain so that I seemed to have the whole Species before my Eyes A Voice was heard from the Clouds declaring the Intention of this Visit which was to restore and appropri∣ate to every one living what was his Due The Fear and Hope Joy and Sorrow which appear∣ed in that great Assembly after this solemn De∣claration a  not to be expressed The first E∣dict was then pronounced  That all Titles and Claims to Riches and Estates or to any part of'em should be immediately vested in the rightful Own∣er  Upon this the Inhabitants of the Earth held up the Instruments of their Tenure whe∣ther in Parchment Paper Wax or any other Form of Conveyance and as the Goddess moved the Mirror of Truth which she held in her Hand so that the Light which flowed from it fell up∣on the Multitude they examined the several In∣struments by the Beams of it The Rays of this Mirror had a particular Quality of setting Fire to all Forgery and Falshood The Blaze of Papers the Melting of Seals and Crackling of Parch∣ments  made a very odd Scene The Fire very often ran through two or three Lines only and then stopped Tho' I could not but observe that the Flame chiefly broke out among the Interli∣neations and Codicils the Light of the Mirror as it was turned up and down pierced into all the dark Corners and Recesses of the Universe and by that Means detected many Writings and Records which had been hidden or buried by Time Chance or Design This occasioned a wonderful Revolution among the People At the same Time the Spoils of Extortion Fraud and Robbery with all the Fruits of Bribery and Cor∣ruption were thrown together into a prodigious Pile that almost reached to the Clouds and was called  The Mount of Restitution  to which all in∣jured Persons were invited to receive what be∣longed to them  One might see Crowds of People in tattered Garments come up and changed Clothes with others that were dressed with Lace and Embroi∣dery Several who were Plumbs or very near it became Men of moderate Fortunes and many others who were overgrown in Wealth and Pos∣sessions had no more left than what they usual∣ly spent What moved my Concern most was to see a certain Street of the greatest Credit in  Europe  from one End to the other become Bank∣rupt  The next Command was for the whole Body of Mankind to separate themselves into their pro∣per Families which was no sooner done but an Edict was issued out requiring all Children  to repair to their True and Natural Fathers  This put a great Part of the Assembly in Motion for as the Mirror was moved over them it inspired every one with such a natural Instinct as dire∣cted them to their real Parents It was a very melancholy Spectacle to see the Fathers of very large Families become Childless and Batchelors  undone by a Charge of Sons and Daughters You might see a Presumptive Heir of a great Estate ask Blessing of his Coachman and a celebrated Toast paying her Duty to a  Valet de Chambre  Many under Vows of Celibacy appeared surroun∣ded with a numerous Issue This Change of Pa∣rentage would have caused great Lamentation but that the Calamity was pretty common and that generally those who lost their Children had the Satisfaction of seeing them put into the Hands of their dearest Friends Men were no sooner settled in their Right to their Possessions and their Progeny but there was a Third Order proclaimed  That all the Posts of Dignity and Honour in the Universe should be conferred on Persons of the greatest Merit Abilities and Per∣fection  The Handsome the Strong and the Wealthy immediately pressed forward but not being able to bear the Splendor of the Mirror which played upon their Faces they immediate∣ly fell back among the Crowd But as the God∣dess tried the Multitude by her Glass as the Ea∣gle does its young Ones by the Lustre of the Sun it was remarkable that every one turned away his Face from it who had not distinguished him∣self either by Virtue Knowledge or Capacity in Business either Military or Civil This Select Assembly was drawn up in the Centre of a pro∣digious Multitude which was diffused on all Sides and stood observing them as idle People use to gather about a Regiment that are exerci∣sing their Arms They were drawn up in Three Bodies In the First were the Men of Virtue in the Second Men of Knowledge and in the Third the Men of Business It was impossible to look at the first Column without a secret Vene∣ration their Aspects were so sweetned with Hu∣manity raised with Contemplation embolden∣ed with Resolution and adorned with the most agreeable Airs which are those that proceed  from secret Habits of Virtue I could not but take Notice That there were many Faces among them which were unknown not only to the Mul∣titude but even to several of their own Body  In the Second Column consisting of the Men of Knowledge there had been great Disputes be∣fore they fell into the Ranks which they did not do at last without the positive Command of the Goddess who presided over the Assembly She had so ordered it that Men of the greatest Genius and strongest Sense were placed at the Head of the Column Behind these were such as had formed their Minds very much on the Thoughts and writings of others In the Rear of the Column were Men who had more Wit than Sense or more Learning than Understand∣ing All living Authors of any Value were rang∣ed in one of these Classes but I must confess I was very much surprised to see a great Body of Editors Criticks Commentators and Gramma∣rians meet with so very ill a Reception They had formed themselves into a Body and with a great deal of Arrogance demanded the first Sta∣tion in the Column of Knowledge but the God∣dess instead of complying with their Request clapped them all into Liveries and bid them know themselves for no other but Lacques of the Learned  The Third Column were Men of Business and consisting of Persons in Military and Civil Capa∣cities The former marched out from the rest and placed themselves in the Front at which the o∣ther shook their Heads at them but did not think fit to dispute the Post with them I could not but make several Observations upon this last Co∣lumn of People but I have certain private Rea∣sons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the Publick In order to fill up all the Posts of Honour Dignity and Profit there was a Draught made out of each Column of Men who  were Masters of all Three Qualifications in some Degree and were preferred to Stations of the first Rank The second Draught was made out of such as were possessed of any Two of the Quali∣fications who were disposed of in Stations of a second Dignity Those who were left and were endowed only with one of them had their sui∣table Posts When this was over there remain∣ed many Places of Trust and Profit unfilled for which there were fresh Draughts made out of the surrounding Multitude who had any Appear∣ance of these Excellencies or were recommended by those who possessed them in Reality  All were surprised to see so many new Faces in the most eminent Dignities and for my own Part I was very well pleased to see that all my Friends either kept their present Posts or were advanced to higher  Having filled my Paper with those Particulars of my Vision which concern the Male Part of Mankind I must reserve for another Occasion the Sequel of it which relates to the Fair Sex  The TATLER N  o    Postquam fregit subsellia versu  Esurit intactam Paridi nisi vendit Agaven  Juv  From  Tuesday Nov  to  Thursday Dec    From my own Apartment  November  THE Progress of my intended Account of what happened when  Justice  visited Mor∣tals is at present interrupted by the Observation and Sense of an Injustice against which there is no Remedy even in a Kingdom more happy in the Care taken of the Liberty and Property of  the Subject than any other Nation upon Earth This Inquiry is committed by a most impregnable Set of Mortals Men who are Rogues within the Law and in the very Commission of what they are guilty of professedly own that they forbear no Injury but from the Terror of being punished for it These Miscreants are a Set of Wretches we Authors call Pirates who print any Book Poem or Sermon as soon as it appears in the World in a smaller Volume and sell it as all other Thieves do stolen Goods at a cheaper Rate I was in my Rage calling them Rascals Plunderers Robbers HighwaymenBut they acknowledge all that and are pleased with those as well as any other Titles nay will print them themselves to turn the Penny  I am extremely at a Loss how to act against such open Enemies who have not Shame enough to be touched with our Reproaches and are as well defended against what we can say as what we can do Railing therefore we must turn into Complaint which I cannot forbear making when I consider that all the Labours of my long Life may be disappointed by the first Man that pleases to rob me I had flattered my self that my Stock of Learning was worth  l per Annum  which would very handsomely maintain me and my little Family who are so happy or so wise as to want only Necessaries Before Men had come up to this barefaced Impudence it was an Estate to have a Competency of Understanding  An ingenious Drole who is since dead and indeed it is well for him he is so for he must have starved had he lived to this Day used to give me an Account of his good Husbandry in the Management of his Learning He was a general Dealer and had his Amusements as well comical as serious The merry Rogue said when he wanted a Dinner he writ a Paragraph of  TableTalk  and his Bookseller upon Sight paid the Recko∣ning He was a very good Judge of what would  please the People and could aptly hit both the Genius of his Readers and the Season of the Year in his Writings His Brain which was his Estate had as regular and different Produce as other Mens Land From the Beginning of  No∣vember  till the Opening of the Campaigne he writ Pamphlets and Letters to Members of Par∣liament or Friends in the Country But some∣times he would relieve his ordinary Readers with a Murder and lived comfortably a Week or Two upon  strange and lamentable Accidents  A little before the Armies took the Field his Way was to open your Attention with a Prodigy and a Mon∣ster well writ was Two Guinea's the lowest Price This prepared his Readers for  his Great and Bloody News  from  Flanders  in  June  and  July  Poor  Tom  He is goneBut I observed he always looked well after a Battle and was apparently fatter in a fighting Year Had this honest careless Fellow lived till now Famine had stared him in the Face and interrupted his Merriment as it must be a solid Affliction to all those whose Pen is their Por∣tion As for my Part I do not speak wholly for my own Sake in this Point for Palmistry and A∣strology will bring me in greater Gains than these my Papers so that I am only in the Condition of a Lawyer who leaves the Bar for ChamberPra∣ctice However I may be allowed to speak in the Cause of Learning it self and lament that a liberal Education is the only one which a polite Nation makes unprofitable All Mechanick Arti∣zans are allowed to reap the Fruit of their Inven∣tion and Ingenuity without Invasion but he that has separated himself from the rest of Mankind and studied the Wonders of the Creation the Government of his Passions and the Revolutions of the World and has an Ambition to commu∣nicate the Effect of half his Life spent in such noble Enquiries has no Property in what he is willing to produce but is exposed to Robbery and  Want with this melancholy and just Reflection That he is the only Man who is not protected by his Country at the same Time that he best de∣serves it According to the ordinary Rules of Computation the greater the Adventure is the greater ought to be the Profit of those who suc∣ceed in it and by this Measure none have Pre∣tence of turning their Labours to greater Advan∣tage than Persons brought up to Letters A lear∣ned Education passing through great Schools and Universities is very expensive and consumes a moderate Fortune before it is gone through in its proper Forms The Purchase of an handsome Commission or Employment which would give a Man a good Figure in another Kind of Life is to be made at a much cheaper Rate Now if we consider this expensive Voyage which is under∣taken in the Search of Knowledge and how few there are who take in any considerable Merchan∣dise how less frequent it is to be able to turn what Men have gained into Profit How hard is it that the very small Number who are di∣stinguished with Abilities to know how to vend their Wares and have the good Fortune to bring them into Port should suffer being plunder'd by Privateers under the very Cannon that should pro∣tect them The most eminent and useful Author of the Age we live in after having laid out a Princely Revenue in Works of Charity and Bene∣ficence as became the Greatness of his Mind and the Sanctity of his Character would have left the Person in the World who was the dearest to him in a narrow Condition had not the Sale of his immortal Writings brought her in a very conside∣rable Dowry though it was impossible for it to be equal to their Value Every one will know that I here mean the Works of the late Archbishop of  Canterbury  the Copy of which was sold for a  l  I do not speak with relation to any Party but it has happened and may often so happen that Men of great Learning and Virtue cannot qualify themselves for being employed in Business or re∣ceiving Preferments In this Case you cut them off from all Support if you take from them the Benefit that may arise from their Writings For my own Part I have brought my self to consider Things in so unprejudiced a Manner that I esteem more a Man who can live by the Products of his Understanding than One who does it by the Fa∣vour of Great Men  The Zeal of an Author has transported me thus far though I think my self as much concerned in the Capacity of a Reader If this Practice goes on we must never expect to see again a beautiful Edition of a Book in  Great Britain  We have already seen the Memoirs of Sir  Wil∣liam Temple  published in the same Character and Volume with the History of  Tom Thumb  and the Works of our greatest Poets shrunk into Penny Books and Garlands For my own Part I expect to see my Lucubrations printed on

Veneration I have for the beforementioned useful Society that a Process is gone out against them and that in case of Contempt they may be found or heard of at most Coffeehouses in and about  Westminster  I must desire my Readers to help me out from Time to Time in the Correction of these my Essays for as a shaking Hand does not always write legibly the Press sometimes prints one Word for another and when my Paper is to be revised I am perhaps so busy in observing the Spots of the Moon that I have not Time to find out the  Errata  that are crept into my Lucubrations  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    From my own Apartment  Dec  A Continuation of the Vision  THE Male World were dismissed by the God∣dess of Justice and disappeared when on a sudden the whole Plain was covered with Wo∣men So charming a Multitude filled my Heart with unspeakable Pleasure and as the Celestial Light of the Mirror shone upon their Faces se∣veral of them seemed rather Persons that descen∣ded in the Train of the Goddess than such who were brought before her to their Tryal The Clack of Tongues and Confusion of Voices in this new Assembly was so very great that the Goddess was forced to command Silence several Times and with some Severity before she could make them attentive to her Edicts They were all sensible that the most important Affair among Woman kind was then to be settled which every one knows to be the Point of Place This had raised innumerable Disputes among them and put the whole Sex into a Tumult Every one produced her Claim and pleaded her Preten∣sions Birth Beauty Wit or Wealth were Words that rung in my Ears from all Parts of the Plain Some boasted of the Merit of their Husbands others of their own Power in govern∣ing them Some pleaded their unspotted Virginity others their numerous Issue Some valued them∣selves  as they were the Mothers and others as they were the Daughters of considerable Persons There was not a single Accomplishment unmen∣tioned or unpractised The whole Congrega∣tion was full of Singing Dancing Tossing O∣gling Squeaking Smiling Sighing Fanning Frowning and all those irresistible Arts which Women put in Practice to captivate the Hearts of reasonable Creatures The Goddess to end this Dispute caused it to be proclaimed That every one should take Place according as she was more or less beautiful This Declaration gave great Satisfaction to the whole Assembly which immediately bridled up and appeared in all its Beauties Such as believed themselves graceful in their Motion found an Occasion of falling back advancing forward or making a false Step that they might show their Persons in the most becoming Air Such as had fine Necks and Bosoms were wonderfully curious to look over the Heads of the Multitude and ob∣serve the most distant Parts of the Assembly Several clapped their Hands on their Foreheads as helping their Sight to look upon the Glories that surrounded the Goddess but in Reality to show fine Hands and Arms The Ladies were yet better pleased when they heard that in the Decision of this great Controversy each of them should be her own Judge and take her Place according to her own Opinion of her self when she consulted her Lookingglass  The Goddess then let down the Mirror of Truth in a Golden Chain which appeared lar∣ger in Proportion as it descended and approached nearer to the Eyes of the Beholders It was the particular Propriety of this Lookingglass to ba∣nish all false Appearances and show People what they are The whole Woman was repre∣sented without Regard to the usual external Features which were made entirely conformable  to their real Characters In short the most ac¦complished taking in the whole Circle of Fe¦male Perfections were the most beautiful an  the most defective the most deformed Th  Goddess so varied the Motion of the Glas  and placed it in so many different Lights tha  each had an Opportunity of seeing her self in it  It is impossible to describe the Rage the Plea∣sure or Astonishment that appeared in each Face upon its Represention in the Mirror Mul∣titudes started at their own Form and would have broke the Glass if they could have reached it Many saw their Blooming Features wither as they looked upon them and their Self Ad∣miration turned into a Loathing and Abhorrence The Lady who was thought so agreeable in her Anger and was so often celebrated for a Wo∣man of Fire and Spirit was frighted at her own Image and fancied she saw a Fury in the Glass The interested Mistress beheld a Harpy and the subtile Jilt a Sphinx I was very much troubled in my own Heart to see such a Destruction of fine Faces but at the same Time had the Plea∣sure of seeing several improved which I had before looked upon as the greatest Masterpieces of Nature I observed that some few were so humble as to be surprised at their own Charms and that many a one who had lived in the Re∣tirement and Severity of a Vestal shined forth in all the Graces and Attractions of a Syren I was ravished at the Sight of a particular Image in the Mirror which I think the most beautiful Object that my Eyes ever beheld There was something more than Humane in her Counte∣nance Her Eyes were so full of Light that they seemed to beautify every Thing they looked up∣on Her Face was enlivened with such a florid Bloom as did not so properly seem the Mark of Health as of Immortality Her Shape he Sta∣ture  and her Mien were such as distinguish'd her even there where the whole Fair Sex was as∣sembled  I was impatient to see the Lady represented by so divine an Image whom I found to be the Per∣son that stood at my Right Hand and in the same Point of View with my self This was a little old Woman who in her Prime had been about Five Foot high though at present shrunk to about Three Quarters of that Measure Her na∣tural Aspect was puckered up with Wrinkles and her Head covered with grey Hairs I had observed all along an innocent Chearfulness in her Face which was now heighten'd into Rap∣ture as she beheld her self in the Glass It was an odd Circumstance in my Dream but I cannot forbear relating it I conceived so great an In∣clination towards her that I had Thoughts of discoursing her upon the Point of Marriage when on a sudden she was carried from me for the Word was now given that all who were pleased with their own Images should separate and place themselves at the Head of their Sex  This Detachment was afterwards divided into Three Bodies consisting of Maids Wives and Widows the Wives being placed in the Middle with the Maids on the Right and Widows on the Left though it was with Difficulty that these Two last Bodies were hinder'd from falling into the Centre This Separation of those who liked their real selves not having lessened the Number of the main Body so considerably as it might have been wished the Goddess after ha∣ving drawn up her Mirror thought fit to make new Distinctions among those who did not like the Figure which they saw in it She made se∣veral wholesome Edicts which are slipt out of my Mind but there were Two which dwelt upon me as being very extraordinary in their Kind and executed with great Severity Their  Design was to make an Example of Two Ex∣tremes in the Female World of those who are very severe on the Conduct of others and of those who are very regardless of their own The first Sentence therefore the Goddess pronounced was That all Females addicted to Censoriousness and Detra∣ction should lose the Use of Speech a Punish∣ment which would be the most grievous to the Offender and what should be the End of all Punishments effectual for rooting out the Crime Upon this Edict which was as soon executed as published the Noise of the Assembly very con∣siderably abated It was a melancholy Spectacle to see so many who had the Reputation of rigid Virtue struck dumb A Lady who stood by me and saw my Concern told me She wondered how I could be concerned for such a Pack ofI found by the Shaking of her Head she was going to give me their Characters but by her saying no more I perceived she had lost the Command of her Tongue This Calamity felt very heavy upon that Part of Women who are distinguish'd by the Name of  Prudes  a Courtly Word for Female Hypocrites who have a shert Way to being virtuous by showing that others are vitious The Second Sentence was then pro∣nounced against the loose Part of the Sex That all should immediately be pregnant who in any Part of their Lives had ran the Hazard of it This produced a very goodly Appearance and revealed so many Misconducts that made those who were lately struck dumb repine more than ever at their Want of Utterance though at the same Time as Afflictions seldom come single many of the Mutes were also seized with this new Calamity The Ladies were now in such a Condition that they would have wanted Room had not the Plain been large enough to let them divide their Ground and extend their Lines on all Sides It was a sensible Affliction  to me to see such a Multitude of Fair Ones either dumb or bigbellied But I was something more at Ease when I found that they agreed upon se∣veral Regulations to cover such Misfortunes A∣mong others that it should be an established Maxim in all Nations That a Woman's First Child might come into the World within Six Months after her Acquaintance with her Hus∣band and that Grief might retard the Birth of her last till Fourteen Months after his De∣cease  This Vision lasted till my usual Hour of Wa∣king which I did with some Surprise to find my self alone after having been engaged al∣most a whole Night in so prodigious a Multitude I could not but reflect with Wonder at the Par∣tiality and Extravagance of my Vision which according to my Thoughts has not done Ju∣stice to the Sex If Virtue in Men is more Ve∣nerable it is in Women more Lovely which  Milton  has very finely expressed in his  Paradise Lost  where  Adam  speaking of  Eve  after ha∣ving asserted his own Preeminence as being First in Creation and internal Faculties breaks out into the following Rapture  Yet when I approach  Her Loveliness so Absolute she seems  And in her self Compleat so well to know  Her own that what she wills or do or say  Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  All higher Knowledge in her Presence falls  Degraded Wisdom in Discourse with her  Loses discountenanced and like Folly shows  Authority and Reason on her wait  As one intended first not after made  Occasionally And to consummate all  Greatness of Mind and Nobleness their Seat  Build in her loveliest and

of this Kind upon my Spirits at present oc∣casioned by the Fatigue of Affairs which I went through last  Saturday  It is some Time since I set apart that Day for examining the Pretensions of several who had applied to me for Canes PerspectiveGlasses SnuffBoxes OrangeFlowerWaters and the like Ornaments of Life In or∣der to adjust this Matter I had before directed  Charles Lillie  of  BeaufordBuildings  to prepare a great Bundle of Blank Licences in the follow∣ing Words  You are hereby required to permit the Bearer of this Cane to pass and repass through the Streets and Suburbs of  London  or any Place within Ten Miles of it without Lett or Molestation provided that he does not walk with it under his Arm bran∣dish it in the Air or hang it on a Button In which Case it shall be forfeited and I hereby declare it forfeited to any one who shall think it safe to take it from him  Isaac Bickerstaff  The same Form differing only in the Proviso's will serve for a Perspective SnuffBox or Per∣fumed Handkerchief I had placed my self in my ElbowChair at the upper End of my great  Pa lour having ordered  Charles Lillie  to take his Place upon a JointStool with a WritingDesk before him  John Morphew  also took his Station at the Door I having for his good and faithful Services appointed him my ChamberKeeper upon CourtDays He let me know That there were a great Number attending without Upon which I ordered him to give Notice That I did not intend to sit upon SnuffBoxes that Day but that those who appeared for Canes might enter The first presented me with the following Peti∣tion which I ordered Mr  Lillie  to read  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  GreatBritain  The Humble Petition of  Simon Trippit  Sheweth  That your Petitioner having been bred up to a Cane from his Youth it is now become as necessary to him as any other of his Limbs  That a great Part of his Behaviour depending upon it he should be reduced to the utmost Necessities if he should lose the Use of it  That the Knocking of it upon his Shoe Leaning one Leg upon it or Whistling with it on his Mouth are such great Reliefs to him in Conversation that he does not know how to be good Company without it  That he is at present engaged in an Amour and must despair of Success if it be taken from him  Your Petitioner therefore hopes that the Premisses tenderly considered your Worship will not deprive him of so useful and so necessary a Support  And your Petitioner shall ever  c  Upon the hearing of his Case I was touched with some Compassion and the more so when upon observing him nearer I found he was a  Prig  I bid him produce his Cane in Court which he had left at the Door He did so and I finding it to be very curiously clouded with a transpa∣rent  Amber Head and a blue Ribbon to hang upon his Wrist I immediately ordered my Clerk  Lillie  to lay it up and deliver out to him a plain Joint headed with Walnut and then in order to wean him from it by Degrees permitted him to wear it Three Days in the Week and to abate proportionably till he found himself able to go alone  The Second who appeared came limping into the Court And setting forth in his Petition many Pretences for the Use of a Cane I caused them to be examined one by one but finding him in different Stories and confronting him with several Witnesses who had seen him walk upright I ordered Mr  Lillie  to take in his Cane and rejected his Petition as frivolous  A Third made his Entry with great Difficulty leaning upon a slight Stick and in Danger of falling every Step he took I saw the Weakness of his Hams and hearing that he had married a young Wife about a Fortnight before I bid him leave his Cane and gave him a new Pair of Crutches with which he went off in great Vi∣gour and Alacrity This Gentleman was succeed∣ed by another who seemed very much pleased while his Petition was reading in which he had represented That he was extremely afflicted with the Gout and set his Foot upon the Ground with the Caution and Dignity which accompany that Distemper I suspected him for an Impostor and having ordered him to be searched I com∣mitted him into the Hands of Dr  Thomas Smith  in  Kingstreet  my own CornCutter who atten∣ded in an outward Room and wrought so spee∣dy a Cure upon him that I thought fit to send him also away without his Cane  While I was thus dispensing Justice I heard a Noise in my outward Room and enquiring what was the Occasion of it my DoorKeeper told me that they had taken up one in the very  Fact as he was passing by my Door They im∣mediately brought in a lively freshcoloured young Man who made great Resistance with Hand and Foot but did not offer to make Use of his Cane which hung upon his Fifth Button Upon Examination I found him to be an  Oxford  Scholar who was just entered at the  Temple  He at first disputed the Jurisdiction of the Court but being driven out of his little Law and Lo∣gick he told me very pertly That he looked upon such a prependicular Creature as Man to make a very imperfect Figure without a Cane in his Hand It is well known says he we ought according to the natural Situation of our Bodies to walk upon our Hands and Feet and that the Wisdom of the Ancients had described Man to be an Animal of Four Legs in the Morning Two at Noon and Three at Night by which they intimated that a Cane might very properly be∣come Part of us in some Period of Life Upon which I asked him Whether he wore it at his Breast to have it in Readiness when that Period should arrive My young Lawyer immediately told me He had a Property in it and a Right to hang it where he pleased and to make Use of it as he thought fit provided that he did not break the Peace with it And further said That he never took it off his Button unless it were to lift it up at a Coachman hold it over the Head of a Drawer point out the Circumstances of a Story or for other Services of the like Na∣ture that are all within the Laws of the Land I did not care for discouraging a young Man who I saw would come to Good and because his Heart was set upon his new Purchase I only or∣dered him to wear it about his Neck instead of hanging it upon his Button and so dismissed him There were several appeared in Court whose Pretensions I found to be very good and there∣fore gave them their Licences upon paying their  Fees as many others had their Licences re∣newed who required more Time for Recovery of their Lameness than I had before allowed them  Having dispatch'd this Set of my Petitioners there came in a welldressed Man with a GlassTube in one Hand and his Petition in the other Upon his entring the Room he threw back the Right Side of his Wig put forward his Right Leg and advancing the Glass to his Right Eye aimed it directly at me In the mean while to make my Observations also I put on my Specta∣cles in which Posture we survey'd each other for some Time Upon the Removal of our Glas∣ses I desired him to read his Petition which he did very promptly and easily though at the same Time it set forth that he could see no∣thing distinctly and was within very few Degrees of being utterly blind concluding with a Prayer That he might be permitted to strengthen and extend his Sight by a Glass In Answer to this I told him he might sometimes extend it to his own Destruction As you are now said I you are out of the Reach of Beauty the Shafts of the finest Eyes lose their Force be∣fore they can come at you you can't distinguish a Toast from an OrangeWench you can see a whole Circle of Beauty without any Interruption from an impertinent Face to discompose you In short what are Snares for othersMy Petitioner would hear no more but told me very seriously Mr  Bickerstaff  you quite mistake your Man it is the Joy the Pleasure the Em∣ployment of my Life to frequent publick Assem∣blies and gaze upon the Fair In a Word I found his Use of a Glass was occasion'd by no other In∣firmity but his Vanity and was not so much de∣sign'd to make him see as to make him be seen and distinguish'd by others I therefore refused him a Licence for a Perspective but allow'd him a Pair  of Spectacles with full Permission to use them in any publick Assembly as he should think fit He was followed by so very few of this Order of Men that I have Reason to hope this Sort of Cheats are almost at an End  The OrangeFlower Men appeared next with Petitions perfumed so strongly with Musk that I was almost overcome with the Scent and for my own Sake was obliged forthwith to license their Handkerchiefs especially when I found they had sweetened them at  Charles Lillie  's and that some of their Persons would not be altoge∣ther inoffensive without them  John Morphew  whom I have made the General of my Dead Men acquainted me That the Petitioners were all of that Order and could produce Certificates to prove it if I requir'd it I was so well plea∣sed with this Way of their Embalming them∣selves that I commanded the abovesaid  Morphew  to give it in Orders to his whole Army That every one who did not surrender himself up to be disposed of by the Upholders should use the same Method to keep himself sweet during his present State of Putrefaction  I finished my Session with great Content of Mind reflecting upon the Good I had done for however slightly Men may regard these Particu∣larities and little Follies in Dress and Behaviour they lead to greater Evils The bearing to be laughed at for such Singularities teach us in∣sensibly an impertinent Fortitude and enable us to bear publick Censure for Things which more substantially deserve it By this Means they open a Gate to Folly and oftentimes render a Man so ridiculous as discredit his Virtues and Capacities and unqualify them from doing any Good in the World Besides the giving into un∣common Habits of this Nature is a Want of that humble Deference which is due to Man∣kind and what is worst of all the certain In∣dication  of some secret Flaw in the Mind of the Person that commits them When I was a young Man I remember a Gentleman of great Integrity and Worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad Belt and an Hanger instead of a fashionable Sword though in all other Points a very well bred Man I suspected him at first Sight to have something wrong in him but was not able for a long while to discover any colla∣teral Proofs of it I watched him narrowly for Six and thirty Years when at last to the Sur∣prize of every Body but my self who had long expected to see the Folly break out he married his own CookMaid  The TATLER N  o    Garrit aniles  Ex re Fabellas  Hor  From  Tuesd Dec  to  Thursd Dec    From my own Apartment  Dec  MY Brother  Tranquillus  being gone out of Town for some Days my Sister  Jenny  sent me Word she would come and dine with me and therefore desired me to have no other Com∣pany I took Care accordingly and was not a little pleased to see her enter the Room with a Decent and Matronlike Behaviour which I thought very much became her I saw she had a great deal to say to me and easily discovered in her Eyes and the Air of her Countenance that she had abundance of Satisfaction in her Heart which she longed to communicate How∣ever I was resolved to let her break into her Discourse her own Way and reduced her to a  Thousand little Devices and Intimations to bring me to the Mention of her Husband But find∣ing I was resolved not to name him she began of her own Accord My Husband said she gives his humble Service to you To which I only answered I hope he is well and without waiting for a Reply fell into other Subjects She at last was out of all Patience and said with a Smile and Manner that I thought had more Beauty and Spirit than I had ever observed before in her I did not think Brother you had been so illnatured You have seen ever since I came in that I had a Mind to talk of my Husband and you won't be so kind as to give me an Occasion I did not know said I but it might be a disagreeable Subject to you You do not take me for so oldfashioned a Fellow as to think of entertaining a young Lady with the Discourse of her Husband I know nothing is more acceptable than to speak of one who is to be so but to speak of one who is so Indeed  Jenny  I am a better bred Man than you think me She showed a little Dislike at my Raillery and by her bridling up I perceived she expected to be treated hereafter not as  Jenny Distaff  but Mrs  Tranquillus  I was very well pleased with this Change in her Humour and upon talking with her on several Subjects I could not but fancy that I saw a great deal of her Husband's Way and Manner in her Remarks her Phrases the Tone of her Voice and the very Air of her Countenance This gave me an unspeakable Sa∣tisfaction not only because I had found her an Husband from whom she could learn many Things that were laudable but also because I looked upon her Imitation of him as an infalli∣ble Sign that she intirely loved him This is an Observation that I never knew fail though I do not remember that any other has made it The natural Shyness of her Sex hindered her from  telling me the Greatness of her own Passion but I easily collected it from the Representation she gave me of his I have every Thing says she in  Tranquillus  that I can wish for and enjoy in him what indeed you have told me were to be met with in a good Husband the Fondness of a Lover the Tenderness of a Parent and the In∣timacy of a Friend It transported me to see her Eyes swimming in Tears of Affection when she spoke And is there not Dear Sister said I more Pleasure in the Possession of such a Man than in all the little Impertinencies of Balls As∣semblies and Equipage which it cost me so much Pains to make you contemn She answer'd smiling  Tranquillus  has made me a sincere Con∣vert in a few Weeks though I am afraid you could not have done it in your whole Life To tell you truly I have only one Fear hanging upon me which is apt to give me Trouble in the Midst of all my Satisfactions I am afraid you must know that I shall not always make the same amiable Appearance in his Eye that I do at present You know Brother  Bickerstaff  that you have the Reputation of a Conjurer and if you have any one Secret in your Art to make your Sister always beautiful I should be happier than if I were Mistress of all the Worlds you have shown me in a Starry Night  Jenny  said I without having Recourse to Magick I shall give you one plain Rule that will not fail of making you always amiable to a Man who has so great a Passion for you and is of so equal and reasonable a Temper as  Tranquillus  Endeavour to please and you must please be always in the same Disposition as you are when you ask for this Secret and you may take my Word you will never want it An inviolable Fidelity good Humour and Complacency of Temper outlive all the Charms of a fine Face and make the De∣cays of it invisible  We discoursed very long upon this Head which was equally agreeable to us both for I must confess as I tenderly love her I take as much Pleasure in giving her Instructions for her Welfare as she her self does in receiving them I proceeded therefore to inculcate these Senti∣ments by relating a very particular Passage that happened within my own Knowledge  There were several of us making merry at a Friend's House in a Country Village when the Sexton of the ParishChurch entered the Room in a Sort of Surprize and told us That as he was digging a Grave in the Chancel a lit∣tle Blow of his Pickax open'd a decayed Cof∣fin in which there were several written Papers Our Curiosity was immediately raised so that we went to the Place where the Sexton had been at work and found a great Concourse of People about the Grave Among the rest there was an old Woman who told us the Person buried there was a Lady whose Name I do not think fit to mention though there is nothing in the Story but what tends very much to her Honour This Lady lived several Years an Exemplary Pattern of Conjugal Love and dying soon after her Hus∣band who every Way answer'd her Character in Virtue and Affection made it her DeathBed Re∣quest That all the Letters which she had re∣ceived from him both before and after her Mar∣riage should be buried in the Coffin with her These I found upon Examination were the Papers before us Several of them had suffered so much by Time that I could only pick out a few Words as My Soul Lillies Roses Dearest Angel and the like One of them which was legible through∣out ran thus  MADAM  IF you would know the Greatness of my Love con∣sider that of your own Beauty That Blooming  Countenance that Snowy Bosom that Graceful Per∣son return every Moment to my Imagination The Brightness of your Eyes hath hindered me from closing mine since I last saw you You may still add to your Beauties by a Smile A Frown will make me the most wretched of Men as I am the most passionate of Lovers  It filled the whole Company with a deep Me∣lancholy to compare the Description of the Let∣ter with the Person that occasioned it who was now reduced to a few crumbling Bones and a little mouldring Heap of Earth With much ado I deciphered another Letter which begun with  My dear dear Wife  This gave me a Curi∣osity to see how the Style of one written in Mar∣riage differed from one written in Courtship To my Surprize I found the Fondness rather aug∣mented than lessened though the Panegyrick turned upon a different Accomplishment The Words were as follow  BEfore this short Absence from you I did not know that I loved you so much as I really do though at the same Time I thought I loved you as much as possible I am under great Apprehensions left you should have any Uneasiness whilst I am de∣frauded of my Share in it and can't think of tast∣ing any Pleasures that you don't partake with me Pray my Dear be careful of your Health if for no other Reason because you know I could not cutlive you It is natural in Absence to make Professions of an inviolable Constancy but towards so much Merit it is scarce a Virtue especially when it is but a bare Return to that of which you have given me such continued Proofs ever since our first Acquaintance  I am  c  It happened that the Daughter of these Two excellent Persons was by when I was reading  this Letter At the Sight of the Coffin in which was the Body of her Mother near that of her Father she melted into a Flood of Tears As I had heard a great Character of her Virtue and observed in her this Instance of Filial Piety I could not resist my natural Inclination of giving Advice to young People and therefore addressed my self to her Young Lady said I you see how short is the Possession of that Beauty in which Nature has been so liberal to you You find the melancholy Sight before you is a Con∣tradiction to the First Letter that you heard on that Subject whereas you may observe the Second Letter which celebrates your Mother's Constancy is it self being found in this Place an Argument of it But Madam I ought to caution you not to think the Bodies that lie be∣fore you your Father and your Mother Know their Constancy is rewarded by a nobler Union than by this mingling of their Ashes in a State where there is no Danger or Possibility of a Se∣cond Separation  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    SheerLane  December  AS soon as my Midnight Studies are finished I take but a very short Repose and am again up at an Exercise of another Kind that is to say my Fencing Thus my Life passes away in a restless Pursuit of Fame and a Preparation to defend my self against such as attack it This Anxiety in the Point of Reputation is the pecu∣liar Distress of fine Spirits and makes them lia∣ble to a Thousand Inquietudes from which Men  of grosser Understandings are exempt so that Nothing is more common than to see one Part of Mankind live at perfect Ease under such Cir∣cumstances as would make another Part of them entirely miserable  This may serve for a Preface to the History of poor  Will Rosin  the Fidler of  Wapping  who is a Man as much made for Happiness and a quiet Life as any one breathing but has been lately intangled in so many intricate and unreasonable Distresses as would have made him had he been a Man of too nice Honour the most wretch∣ed of all Mortals I came to the Knowledge of his Affairs by meer Accident Several of the narrow End of our Lane having made an Ap∣pointment to visit some Friends beyond St  Ka∣therine  's where there was to be a merry Meet∣ing they would needs take with them the Old Gentleman as they are pleased to call me I who value my Company by their good Will which naturally has the same Effect as good Breeding was not too stately or too wise to accept of the Invitation Our Design was to be Spectators of a Sea Ball to which I readily consented pro∣vided I might be  incognito  being naturally plea∣sed with the Survey of humane Life in all its Degrees and Circumstances In order to this Merriment  Will Rosin  who is the  Corelli  of the  Wapping  Side as  Tom Scrape  is the  Bononcini  of  Redriffe  was immediately sent for but to our utter Disappointment poor  Will  was under an Arrest and desired the Assistance of all his kind Masters and Mistresses or he must go to Gaol The whole Company received his Message with great Humanity and very generously threw in their Halfpence apiece in a great Dish which purchased his Redemption out of the Hands of the Bailiffs During the Negotiation for his En∣largement I had an Opportunity of acquainting my self with his History  Mr  William Rosin  of the Parish of St  Kathe∣rine  is somewhat stricken in Years and married to a young Woman who has very much the As∣cendant over him This degenerate Age be∣ing so perverted in all Things that even in the State of Matrimony the Young pretend to go∣vern their Elders The Musician is extremely fond of her but is often obliged to lay by his Fiddle to hear louder Notes of hers when she is pleased to be angry with him For you are to know  Will  is not of Consequence enough to enjoy her Conversation but when she chides him or makes use of him to carry on her Amours For she is a Woman of Stratagem and even in that Part of the World where one would expect but very little Gallantry by the Force of natural Genius she can be sullen sick out of Humour Splenatick want new Clothes and more Money as well as if she had been bred in  Cheapside  or  Cornhill  She was lately under a secret Discontent upon Account of a Lover she was like to lose by his Marriage For her Gal∣lant Mr  Ezekiel Boniface  had been twice asked in Church in order to be joined in Matrimony with Mrs  Winifred Dimple  Spinster of the same Parish Hereupon Mrs  Rosin  was far gone in that Distemper which wellgoverned Husbands know by the Description of  I am I know not how  and  Will  soon understood that it was his Part to enquire into the Occasion of her Melan∣choly or suffer as the Cause of it himself After much Importunity all he could get out of her was That she was the most unhappy and the most wicked of all Women and had no Friend in the World to tell her Grief to Upon this  Will  doubled his Importunities but she said That she should break her poor Heart if he did not take a solemn Oath upon a Book that he would not be angry and that he would expose the Person who had wronged her to all the  World for the Ease of her Mind which was no way else to be quieted The Fidler was so mel∣ted that he immediately kissed her and after∣wards the Book When his Oath was taken she began to lament her self and revealed to him that miserable Woman as she was she had been false to his Bed  Will  was glad to hear it was no worse but before he could reply Nay said she I will make you all the Atonement I can and take Shame upon me by proclaiming it to all the World which is the only Thing that can re∣move my present Terrors of Mind This was in∣deed too true for her Design was to prevent Mr  Boniface  's Marriage which was all she appre∣hended  Will  was throughly angry and began to curse and swear the ordinary Expressions of Passion in Persons of his Condition Upon which his WifeAh  William  How well you mind the Oath you have taken and the Distress of your poor Wife who can keep nothing from you I hope you won't be such a perjur'd Wretch as to forswear your self The Fiddler answer'd That his Oath obliged him only not to be angry at what was passed but I find you intend to make me laughed at all over  Wapping  No no replied Mrs  Rosin  I see well enough what you would be at you poorspirited CuckoldYou are afraid to expose  Boniface  who has abused your poor Wife and would fain perswade me still to suffer the Stings of Conscience but I assure you Sirrah I won't go to the Devil for you Poor  Will  was not made for Contention and beseeching her to be pacified desired she would consult the Good of her Soul her own Way for he would not say her nay in any Thing  Mrs  Rosin  was so very loud and publick in her Invectives against  Boniface  that the Parents of his Mistress forbad the Banes and his Match was prevented which was the whole Design of this deep  atagem The Father of  Boniface  brought  his Action of Defamation arrested the Fiddler and recovered Dammages This was the Distress from which he was relieved by the Company and the good Husband's Air History and Jollity upon his Enlargement gave Occasion to very much Mirth especially when  Will  finding he had Friends to stand by him proclaimed himself a Cuckold by Way of Insult over the Family of the  Bonifaces  Here is a Man of Tranquility without reading  Seneca  What Work had such an Incident made among Persons of Distinction The Brothers and Kindred of each Side must have been drawn out and Hereditary Hatred entailed on the Families as long as their very Names re∣mained in the World Who would believe that  Herod Othello  and  Will Rosin  were of the same Species  There are quite different Sentiments which reign in the Parlour and the Kitchin and it is by the Point of Honour when justly regulated and inviolably observed that some Men are superior to others as much as Mankind in general are to Brutes This puts me in Mind of a Passage in the admirable Poem called the  Dispensary  where the Nature of true Honour is artfully described in an Ironical Dispraise of it  But e're we once engage in Honour's Cause  First know what Honour is and whence it was  Scorn'd by the Base 'tis courted by the Brave  The Hero's Tyrant and the Coward's Slave  Born in the noisy Camp it lives on Air  And both exists by Hope and by Despair  Angry when e're a Moment's Ease we gain  And reconcil'd at our Returns of Pain  It lives when in Death's Arms the Here lies  But when his Safety he consults it dies  Bigotted to this Idel we disclaim  Rest Health and Ease for nothing but a Name  A very odd Fellow visited me to Day at my Lodgings and desired Encouragement and Recom∣mendation from me for a new Invention of Knockers to Doors which he told me he had made and pro∣fessed to teach Rustick Servants the Use of them I desired him to show me an Experiment of this In∣vention upon which he fined one of his Knockers to my Parlour Door He then gave me a compleat Set of Knocks from the solitary Rap of the Dun and Beggar to the Thunderings of the sawcy Foot∣man of Quality with several Flourishes and Rat∣lings never yet performed He likewise played over some private Notes distinguishing the familiar Friend or Relation from the most modish Visitor and directing when the Reserve Candles are to be lighted He has several other Curiosities in this Art He waits only to receive my Approbation of the main Design He is now ready to practise to such as shall apply themselves to him

 December  I Was this Evening sitting at the SideTable and reading one of my own Papers with great Satisfaction not knowing that I was observed by any in the Room I had not long enjoyed this secret Pleasure of an Author when a Gentleman some of whose Works I have been highly enter∣tained  with accosted me after the following Manner Mr  Bickerstaff  you know I have for some Years devoted my self wholly to the Mu∣ses and perhaps you will be surprized when I tell you I am resolved to take up and apply my self to Business I shall therefore beg you will stand my Friend and recommend a Customer to me for several Goods that I have now upon my Hands I desir'd him to let me have a Particu∣lar and I would do my utmost to serve him I have first of all says he the Progress of an Amour digested into Sonnets beginning with a Poem to the unknown Fair and ending with an Epithalamium I have celebrated in it her Cruelty her Pity her Face her Shape her Wit her good Humour her Dancing her Sing∣ing  I could not forbear interrupting him This is a most accomplished Lady said I but has she really with all these Perfections a fine Voice  Pugh says he you do not believe there is such a Person in Nature This was only my Employ∣ment in Solitude last Summer when I had nei∣ther Friends or Books to divert me I was go∣ing says I to ask her Name but I find it is only an imaginary Mistress That's true replied my Friend but her Name is  Flavia  I have continued he in the Second Place a Collection of Lampoons calculated either for the  Bath Tunbridge  or any Place where they drink Wa∣ters with blank Spaces for the Names of such Person or Persons as may be inserted in them on Occasion Thus much I have told only of what I have by me proceeding from Love and Malice I have also at this Time the Sketch of an He∣roick Poem upon the next Peace Several indeed of the Verses are either too long or too short it being a rough Draught of my Thoughts upon that Subject I thereupon told him That as it was it might probably pass for a very good Pin∣darick and I believed I knew one who would be  willing to deal with him for it upon that Foot I must tell you also I have made a Dedication to it which is about four Sides close written that may serve any one that is tall and understands  Latin  I have further about Fifty Similies that were ne∣ver yet applied besides Three and twenty De∣scriptions of the Sunrising that might be of great Use to an Epick Poet These are my more bulky Commodities Besides which I have several small Wares that I would part with at easy Rates as Observations upon Life and Moral Sentences re∣duced into several Couplets very proper to close up Acts of Plays and may be easily introduced by two or three Lines of Prose either in Tragedy or Comedy If I could find a Purchaser curious in  Latin  Poetry I could accommodate him with Two Dozen of Epigrams which by Reason of a few false Quantities should come for little or no∣thing  I heard the Gentleman with much Attention and asked him Whether he would break Bulk and sell his Goods by Retail or designed they should all go in a Lump He told me That he should be very loth to part them unless it was to oblige a Man of Quality or any Person for whom I had a particular Friendship My Reason for asking said I is only because I know a young Gentleman who intends to appear next Spring in a new gingling Chariot with the Figures of the Nine Muses on each Side of it and I believe would be glad to come into the World in Verse We could not go on in our Treaty by reason of Two or Three Criticks that joined us They had been talking it seems of the Two Letters which were found in the Coffin and mentioned in one of my late Lucubrations and came with a Request to me that I would communicate any others of them that were legible One of the Gentlemen was pleased to say That it was a very proper In∣stance of a Widow's Constancy and said he  wished I had subjoined as a Foil to it the follow∣ing Passage in  Hamlet  The young Prince was not yet acquainted with all the Guilt of his Mo∣ther but turns his Thoughts on her sudden For∣getfulness of his Father and the Indecency of her hasty Marriage  That it

Tender∣ness for his Mother expressed in so delicate a Par∣ticular  his Mother's Fondness for his Father no less exquisitely described the great and amiable Figure of his dead Parent drawn by a true Filial Piety his Disdain of so unworthy a Successor to his Bed But above all the Shortness of the Time between his Father's Death and his Mother's Second Marriage brought together with so much Disorder make up as noble a Part as any in that celebrated Tragedy The Circumstances of Time I never could enough admire The Widowhood had lasted Two Months This is his First Re∣flection But as his Indignation rises he sinks to scarce Two Months Afterwards into a Month and at last into a Little Month But all this so naturally that the Reader accompanies him in the Violence of his Passion and finds the Time lessen insensibly according to the different Work∣ings of his Disdain I have not mentioned the Incest of her Marriage which is so obvious a Pro∣vocation but can't forbear taking Notice that when his Fury is at its Height he cries  Frailty thy Name is Woman  As railing at the Sex in ge∣neral rather than giving himself Leave to think his Mother worse than others  Desiderantur multa

meliore Flammâ  Hor  From  Tuesday Dec  to  Thursd Dec    SheerLane  December  ABout Four this Afternoon which is the Hour I usually put my self in a Readiness to re∣ceive Company there enter'd a Gentleman who I believed at first came upon some ordinary Que∣stion but as he approached nearer to me I saw in his Countenance a deep Sorrow mixed with a certain ingenuous Complacency that gave me a sudden Goodwill towards him He star'd and betrayed an Absence of Thought as he was going to communicate his Business to me But at last recovering himself he said with an Air of great Respect Sir It would be an Injury to your Knowledge in the Occult Sciences to tell you what is my Distress I dare say you read it in my Countenance I therefore beg your Advice  to the most unhappy of all Men Much Experi∣ence has made me particularly sagacious in the Dis∣covery of Distempers and I soon saw that his was Love I then turned to my Commonplace Book and found his Case under the Word  Coquette  and reading over the Catalogue which I have collected out of this great City of all under that Character I saw at the Name of  Cynthia  his fit came upon him I repeated the Name thrice after a musing Manner and immediately perceived his Pulse quicken two Thirds when his Eyes instead of the Wildness with which they appeared at his En∣trance looked with all the Gentleness imaginable upon me not without Tears Oh Sir said he you know not the unworthy Usage I have met with from the Woman my Soul doats on I could gaze at her to the End of my Being yet when I have done so for some Time past I have found her Eyes fix'd on another She is now Two and twen∣ty in the full Tyranny of her Charms which she once acknowledg'd she rejoiced in only as they made her Choice of me out of a Crowd of Ad∣mirers the more obliging But in the Midst of this Happiness so it is Mr  Bickerstaff  that young  Quicksett  who is just come to Town without any other Recommendation than that of being tolera∣bly handsome and excessively rich has won her Heart in so shameless a Manner that she dies for him In a Word I would consult you how to cure my self of this Passion for an ungrateful Wo∣man who triumphs in her Falshood and can make no Man happy because her own Satisfaction con∣sists chiefly in being capable of giving Distress I know  Quicksett  is at present considerable with her for no other Reason but that he can be without her and feel no Pain in the Loss Let me therefore de∣sire you Sir to fortify my Reason against the Le∣vity of an Inconstant who ought only to be trea∣ted with Neglect  All this Time I was looking over my Re∣ceipts and asked him if he had any good W  ∣ter BootsBoots Sir said my PatientI  on You may easily reach  Harwich  in a Day so as to be there when the Packet goes off Sir said the Lover I find you design me for Travel∣ling but alas I have no Language it will be the same Thing to me as Solitude to be in a strange Country I have continued he sighing been many Years in Love with this Creature and have almost lost even my  English  at least to speak such as any Body else does I asked a Te∣nant of ours who came up to Town the other Day with Rent Whether the Flowry Meads near my Father's House in the Country had any Shep∣herd in it I have called a Cave a Grotto these Three Years and must keep ordinary Company and frequent busie People for some Time before I can recover my common Words I smiled at his Raillery upon himself though I well saw it came from an heavy Heart You are said I ac∣quainted to be sure with some of the General Of∣ficers Suppose you made a Campaign If I did said he I should venture more than any M  n there for I should be in Danger of starving my Father is such an untoward old Gentleman that he would tell me he sound it hard enough to pay his Taxes towards the War without making it more expensive by an Allowance to me With all this he is as fond as he is ragged and I am his only Son  I looked upon the young Gentleman with much Tenderness and not like a Physician but a Friend for I talked to him so largely that if I had parcelled my Discourse into distinct Pre∣scriptions I am confident I give him Two Hun∣dred Pounds worth of Advice He heard me with great Attention bowing smilling and show∣ing all other Instances of that natural good Breed∣ing which ingenuous Tempers pay to those  who are elder and wiser than themselves I en∣tertained him to the following Purpose I am sorry Sir that your Passion is of so long a Date for Evils are much more curable in their Begin∣nings but at the same Time must allow that you are not to be blamed since your Youth and Merit has been abused by one of the most char∣ming but the most unworthy Sort of Women the Coquets A Coquet is a chast Jilt and dif∣fers only from a Common One as a Soldier who is perfect in Exercise does from one that is actu∣ally in Service This Grief like all other is to be cured only by Time and although you are convinced this Moment as much as you will be Ten Years hence that she ought to be scorned and neglected you see you must not expect your Remedy from the Force of Reason The Cure then is only in Time and the hastening of the Cure only in the Manner of employing that Time You have answered me as to Travel and a Campaign so that we have only  Great Bri∣tain  to avoid her in Be then your self and listen to the following Rules which only can be of Use to you in this unaccountable Distemper wherein the Patient is often averse even to his Recovery It has been of Benefit to some to apply themselves to Business but as that may not lie in your Way go down to your Estate mind your Fox hounds and venture the Life you are weary of over every Hedge and Ditch in the Country These are wholesome Remedies but if you can have Resolution enough rather stay in Town and recover your self even in the Town where she inhabits Take particular Care to avoid all Places where you may possibly meet her and shun the Sight of every Thing which may bring her to your Remembrance there is an Infection in all that relates to her You'll find her House her Chariot her Domesticks and her very LapDog are so many Instruments  of Torment Tell me seriously Do you think you could bear the Sight of her Fan He shook his Head at the Question and said Ah Mr  Bickerstaff  you must have been a Patient or you could not have been so good a Physician To tell you truly said I about the Thirtieth Year of my Age I received a Wound that has still left a Scar in my Mind never to be quite worn out by Time or Philosophy  The Means which I found the most effectual for my Cure were Reflections upon the ill Usage I had received from the Woman I loved and the Pleasure I saw her take in my Sufferings  I considered the Distress she brought upon me the greatest that could befal an humane Crea∣ture at the same Time that she did not inflict this upon one who was her Enemy one that had done her an Injury one that had wished her ill but on the Man who loved her more than any else loved her and more than it was possible for him to love any other Person  In the next Place I took Pains to consider her in all her Imperfections and that I might be sure to hear of them constantly kept Company with those her Female Friends who were her dearest and most intimate Acquaintance  Among her highest Imperfections I still dwelt upon her Baseness of Mind and Ingratitude that made her triumph in the Pain and Anguish of the Man who loved her and of one who in those Days without Vanity be it spoken was thought to deserve her Love  To shorten my Story she was married to ano∣ther which would have distracted me had he proved a good Husband but to my great Plea∣sure he used her at first with Coldness and afterwards with Contempt I hear he still treats her very ill and am informed that she often says to her Woman This is a just Revenge for my Falshood to my First Love What a Wretch  am I that might have been married to the fa∣mous Mr  Bickerstaff  My Patient looked upon me with a kind of me∣lancholy Pleasure and told me He did not think it was possible for a Man to live to the Age I now am of who in his Thirtieth Year had been tor∣tured with that Passion in its Violence For my Part said he I can neither eat drink nor sleep in it nor keep Company with any Body but Two or Three Friends who are in the same Con∣dition  There answer'd I you are to blame for as you ought to avoid nothing more than keeping Company with your self so you ought to be par∣ticularly cautious of keeping Company with Men like your self As long as you do this you do but indulge your Distemper  I must not dismiss you without further Instru∣ctions If possible transfer your Passion from the Woman you are now in Love with to another or if you cannot do that change the Passion it self into some other Passion that is to speak more plainly find out some other agreeable Wo∣man Or if you can't do this grow covetous ambitious litigious turn your Love of Woman into that of Profit Preferment Reputation and for a Time give up your self intirely to the Pur∣suit  This is a Method we sometimes take in Physick when we turn a desperate Disease into one we can more easily cure  He made little Answer to all this but crying out Ah Sir For his Passion reduced his Dis∣course to Interjections  There is one Thing added which is present Death to a Man in your Condition and therefore to be avoided with the greatest Care and Cau∣tion That is in a Word to think of your Mi∣stress and Rival together whether walking dis∣coursing dallyingThe Devil He cried out  Who can bear it To compose him for I pitied him very much the Time will come said I when you shall not only bear it but laugh at it As a Preparation to it ride every Morning an Hour at least with the Wind full in your Face Upon your Return recollect the several Precepts which I have now given you and drink upon them a Bot∣tle of  SpawWater  Repeat this every Day for a Month successively and let me see you at the End of it He was taking his Leave with many Thanks and some Appearance of Consolation in his Countenance when I called him back to ac∣quaint him That I had private Information of a Design of the Coquets to buy up all the true  SpawWater  in Town Upon which he took his Leave in haste with a Resolution to get all Things ready for entring upon his Regimen the next Morning  The TATLER N  o    Prona{que} cum spectant Animalia caetera Terram  Os Homini sublime dedit Coelum{que} tueri  Jussit  Ovid Met  From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    SheerLane  December  IT is not to be imagined how great an Effect well disposed Lights with proper Forms and Orders in Assemblies have upon some Tempers I am sure I feel it in so extraordinary a Manner that I cannot in a Day or Two get out of my Imagination any very beautiful or disagreeable Impression which I receive on such Occasions For this Reason I frequently look in at the Play∣house  in order to enlarge my Thoughts and warm my Mind with some new Idea's that may be serviceable to me in my Lucubrations In this Disposition I entered the Theatre the other Day and placed my self in a Corner of it very convenient for seeing without being my self ob∣served I found the Audience hushed in a very deep Attention and did not question but some noble Tragedy was just then in its Crisis or that an Incident was to be unravelled which would determine the Fate of an Hero While I was in this Suspence expecting every Moment to see my old Friend Mr  Betterton  appear in all the Majesty of Distress to my unspeakable Amaze∣ment there came up a Monster with a Face be∣tween his Feet and as I was looking on he raised himself on one Leg in such a perpendicu∣lar Posture that the other grew in a Direct Line above his Head It afterwards twisted it self into the Motions and Wreathings of several diffe∣rent Animals and after great Variety of Shapes and Transformations went off the Stage in the Figure of an humane Creature The Admira∣tion the Applause the Satisfaction of the Au∣dience during this strange Entertainment is not to be expressed I was very much out of Coun∣tenance for my dear Countrymen and looked about with some Apprehension for Fear any Fo∣reigner should be present Is it possible thought I that humane Nature can rejoice in its Disgrace and take Pleasure in seeing its own Figure turn∣ed to Ridicule and distorted into Forms that raise Horror and Aversion There is something disingenuous and immoral in the being able to bear such a Sight Men of elegant and noble Minds are shocked at seeing the Characters of Persons who deserve Esteem for their Virtue Knowledge or Services to their Country placed in wrong Lights and by Misrepresentation made the Subject of Buffoonry Such a nice Abhor∣rence  is not indeed to be found among the Vul∣gar but methinks it is wonderful that these who have nothing but the outward Figure to distin∣guish them as Men should delight in seeing it a∣bused vilified and disgraced  I must confess there is nothing that more pleases me in all that I read in Books or see among Mankind than such Passages as represent humane Nature in its proper Dignity As Man is a Creature made up of different Extremes he has something in him very great and very mean A skilful Artist may draw an excellent Picture of him in either of these Views The finest Au∣thors of Antiquity have taken him on the more advantagious Side They cultivate the natural Grandeur of the Soul raise in her a generous Ambition feed her with Hopes of Immortality and Perfection and do all they can to widen the Partition between the Virtuous and the Vi∣cious by making the Difference betwixt them as great as between Gods and Brutes In short it is impossible to read a Page in  Plato Tully  and a Thousand other ancient Moralists with∣out being a greater and a better Man for it On the contrary I could never read any of our mo∣dish  French  Authors or those of our own Coun∣try who are the Imitators and Admirers of that trifling Nation without being for some Time out of Humour with my self and at every Thing about me Their Business is to depre∣ciate humane Nature and consider it under its worst Appearances They give mean Interpreta∣tions and base Motives to the worthiest Actions They resolve Virtue and Vice into Constitution In short they endeavour to make no Distinction between Man and Man or between the Species of Men and that of Brutes As an Instance of this kind of Authors among many others let any one examine the celebrated  Rochefaucault  who is the great Philosopher for administring of  Consolation to the Idle the Envious and worth∣less Part of Mankind  I remember a young Gentleman of moderate Understanding but great Vivacity who by dip∣ping into many Authors of this Nature had got a little Smattering of Knowledge just enough to make an Atheist or a Freethinker but not a Philosopher or a Man of Sense With these Ac∣complishments he went to visit his Father in the Country who was a plain rough honest Man and wise though not learned The Son who took all Opportunities to show his Learning began to establish a new Religion in the Family and to enlarge the Narrowness of their Coun∣try Notions in which he succeeded so well that he had seduced the Butler by his Table Talk and staggered his eldest Sister The old Gentle∣man began to be alarmed at the Schisms that arose among his Children but did not yet be∣lieve his Son's Doctrine to be so pernicious as it really was 'till one Day talking of his Setting Dog the Son said He did not question but  Trey  was as immortal as any one of the Family and in the Heat of the Argument told his Father That for his own Part he expected to die like a Dog Upon which the old Man starting up in a very great Passion cried out Then Sirrah you shall live like one and taking his Cane in his Hand cudgelled him out of his System This had so good an Effect upon him that he took up from that Day fell to reading good Books and is now a Bencher in the  MiddleTemple  I do not mention this Cudgelling Part of the Story with a Design to engage the secular Arm in Matters of this Nature but certainly if it ever exerts it self in Affairs of Opinion and Spe∣culation it ought to do it on such shallow and despicable Pretenders to Knowledge who endea∣vour to give a Man dark and uncomfortable Pro∣spects  of his Being and destroy those Principles which are the Support Happiness and Glory of all publick Societies as well as private Persons  I think it is one of  Pythagoras  's Golden Sayings  That a Man should take Care above all Things to have a due Respect for himself  And it is certain that this licentious Sort of Authors who are for depreciating Mankind endeavoured to disappoint and undo what the most refined Spirits have been labouring to advance since the Beginning of the World The very Design of Dress good Breed∣ings outward Ornaments and Ceremony were to lift up humane Nature and set it off to an Ad∣vantage Architecture Painting and Statuary were invented with the same Design as indeed every Art and Science contributes to the Embel∣lishment of Life and to the wearing off or throw∣ing into Shades the mean and low Parts of our Nature Poetry carries on this great End more than all the rest as may be seen in the following Passage taken out of Sir  Francis Bacon  's  Advance∣ment of Learning  which gives a truer and better Account of this Art than all the Volumes that were ever written upon it  Poetry especially Heroical seems to be raised al∣together from a noble Foundation which makes much for the Dignity of Man's Nature For see∣ing this sensible World is in Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man Poesy seems to endow humane Na∣ture with that which History denies and to give Satisfaction to the Mind with at least the Sha∣dow of Things where the Substance cannot be had For if the Matter be throughly considered a strong Argument may be drawn from Poesy that a more stately Greatness of Things a more perfect Order and a more beautiful Variety delights the Soul of Man than any Way can be found in Na∣ture since the Fall Wherefore seeing the Acts and Events which are the Subjects of true History  are not of that Amplitude as to content the Mind of Man Poesy is ready at Hand to feign Acts more Heroical Because true History reports the Successes of Business not proportionable to the Merit of Virtues and Vices Poesy corrects it and presents Events and Fortunes according to Desert and according to the Law of Providence Because true History through the frequent Satiety and Similitude of Things works a Distast and Misprision in the Mind of Man Poesy cheareth and refresheth the Soul chanting Things rare and various and full of Vicissitudes So as Poesy serveth and conferreth to Delectation Magnanimity and Morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some Participation of Divineness because it doth raise the Mind and exalt the Spirit with high Raptures by proportioning the Shews of Things to the Desires of the Mind and not submitting the Mind to Things as Reason and History do And by these Allurements and Congruities whereby it cherisheth the Soul of Man joined also with Consort of Musick whereby it may more sweetly insinuate it self it hath won such Access that it hath been in Estima∣tion even in rude Times and barbarous Nations when other Learning stood excluded  But there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural Greatness and Dignity of hu∣mane Nature so much as Religion which does not only promise the entire Refinement of the Mind but the glorifying of the Body and the Immortality of both  The TATLER N  o    Perditur haec inter miseris lux  Hor  From  Saturday Dec  to  Tuesd Dec    SheerLane  December  THere has not some Years been such a Tu∣mult in our Neighbourhood as this Even∣ing about Six At the lower End of the Lane the Word was given That there was a great Fu∣neral coming by The next Moment came for∣ward in a very hasty instead of a solemn Man∣ner a long Train of Lights when at last a Foot∣man in very high Youth and Health with all his Force ran through the whole Art of beating the Door of the House next to me and ended his Rattle with the true finishing Rap This did not only bring one to the Door at which he knocked but to that of every one in the Lane in an In∣stant Amongst the rest my Country Maid took the Alarm and immediately running to me told me there was a fine fine Lady who had Three Men with Burial Torches making Way before her carried by Two Men upon Poles with Looking∣glasses on each Side of her and one Glass also before she her self appearing the prettiest that ever was The Girl was going on in her Story when the Lady was come to my Door in her Chair having mistaken the House As soon as she entered I saw she was Mr  Isaac  's Scholar by her Speaking Air and the becoming Stop she made when she began her Apology You'll be surprized Sir said she that I take this Li∣berty who am utterly a Stranger to you Be∣sides that it may be thought an Indecorum that  I visit a Man She made here a pretty Hesitation and held her Fan to her FaceThen as if recovering her Resolution she proceededBut I think you have said that Men of your Age are of no Sex therefore I may be as free with you as one of my own The Lady did me the Honour to consult me on some particular Mat∣ters which I am not at Liberty to report But before she took her Leave she produced a long List of Names which she looked upon to know whither she was to go next I must confess I could hardly forbear discovering to her imme∣diately that I secretly laughed at the fantastical Regularity she observed in throwing away her Time but I seemed to indulge her in it out of a Curiosity to hear her own Sense of her Way of Life Mr  Bickerstaff  said she you cannot imagine how much you are obliged to me in staying thus long with you having so ma∣ny Visits to make and indeed if I had not Hopes that a Third Part of those I am going to will be Abroad I should be unable to dispatch them this Evening Madam said I Are you in all this Haste and Perplexity and only going to such as you have not a Mind to see Yes Sir said she I have several now with whom I keep a constant Correspondence and return Visit for Visit punctually every Week and yet we have not seen each other since last  November  was Twelve∣month  She went on with a very good Air and fix∣ing her Eyes on her Li  t told me she was obli∣ged to ride about Three Miles and an half be∣fore she arrived at her own House I asked af∣ter what Manner this Li  t was taken whether the Persons writ their Names to her and desi∣red that Favour or how she knew she was not cheated in her MusterRoll The Method we take says she is That the Porter or Servant who comes to the Door writes down all the  Names who come to see us and all such are en∣titled to a Return of their Visit But said I Ma∣dam I presume those who are searching for each other and know one another by Messages may be understood as Candidates only for each other's Favour and that after so many Howdee's you proceed to visit or not as you like the Run of each other's Reputation or Fortune You understand it aright said she and we become Friends As soon as we are convinced that our Dislike to each other may be of any Consequence for to tell you truly said she for it is in vain to hide any Thing from a Man of your Penetration general Visits are not made out of good Will but for Fear of ill Will Punctuality in this Case is often a suspi∣cious Circumstance and there is nothing so com∣mon as to have a Lady say I hope she has heard nothing of what I said of her that she grows so great with meBut indeed my Porter is so dull and negligent that I fear he has not put down half the People I owe Visits to Madam said I methinks it should be very proper if your GentlemanUsher or Groom of the Chamber were always to keep an Account by Way of Debtor and Creditor I know a City Lady who uses that Method which I think very laudable for tho' you may possibly at the CourtEnd of the Town receive at the Door and light up better than within  Temple Bar  yet I must do that Justice to my Friends the Ladies within the Walls to own that they are much more exact in their Correspon∣dence The Lady I was going to mention as an Example has always the Second Prentice out of the Comptinghouse for her own Use on her Visit∣ingDay and he sets down very methodically all the Visits which are made her I remember very well that on the First of  January  last when she made up her Account for the Year it stood thus  Mrs  Courtwood  Dr  Per contra  Cr  To Seventeen hun∣dred and Four Visits received    By Eleven hun∣dred and Nine paid          Due to Ballance               This Gentlewoman is a Woman of great Oe∣conomy and was not afraid to go to the Bottom of her Affairs and therefore ordered her Ap∣prentice to give her Credit for my Lady  Easy  's impertinent Visits upon wrong Days and de∣duct only Twelve  per Cent  He had Orders also to substract One and an Half from the whole of such as she had denied her self to before she kept a Day and after taking those proper Arti∣cles of Credit on her Side she was in Arrear but Five Hundred She ordered her Husband to buy in a Couple of fresh CoachHorses and with no other Loss than the Death of Two Footmen and a Churchyard Cough brought upon her Coachman she was clear in the World on the th of  February  last and keeps so be∣forehand that she pays every Body their own and yet makes daily new Acquaintances I know not whether this agreeable Visitant was fired with the Example of the Lady I told her of but she immediately vanished out of my Sight it being it seems as necessary a Point of good Breeding to go off as if you stole some∣thing out of the House as it is to enter as if you came to fire it I do not know one Thing that contributes so much to the lessening the Esteem Men of Sense have to the Fair Sex as this Article of Visits A young Lady cannot be married but all the Impertinents in Town must be beating the  Tattoo  from one Quarter of the Town to the other to show they know what passes If a Man of Honour should once in an  Age marry a Woman of Merit for her intrin∣sick Value the envious Things are all in Mo∣tion in an Instant to make it known to the Sister∣hood as an Indiseretion and publish to the Town how many Pounds he might have had to have been troubled with one of them After they are tired with that the next Thing is to make their Compliments to the married Couple and their Re∣lations They are equally busy at a Funeral and the Death of a Person of Quality is always at∣tended with the Murder of several Sets of CoachHorses and Chairmen In both Cases the Visi∣tants are wholly unaffected either with Joy or Sorrow For which Reason their Congratulations and Condoleances are equally Words of Course and one would be thought wonderfully illbred that should build upon such Expressions as Encou∣  agements to expect from them any Instance of Friendship  Thus are the true Causes of Living and the  d Pleasures of Life lost in Show Imposture and Impertinence As for my Part I think most of the Misfortunes in Families arise from the trifling Way the Women have in spending their Time and gratifying only their Eyes and  s instead of their Reason and Understand∣ing  A fine young Woman bred under a Visiting  ther knows all that is possible for her to be  ainted with by Report and sees the Virtuous  d the Vicious used so indifferently that the  rs she is born with are abated and Desires in∣  ged in Proportion to her Love of that light and trisling Conversation I know I talk like an old Man but I must go on to say that I think the general Reception of mixed Company and me Pretty Fellows that are admitted at those Assemblies give a young Woman so false an Idea of Life that she is generally bred up with a  orn of that Sort of Merit in a Man which only  can make her happy in Marriage and the Wretch to whose Lot she falls very often re∣ceives in his Arms a Conquet with the Refuse of an Heart long before given away to a Cox∣comb  Having received from the Society of Upholders sundry Complaints of the obstinate and refractory Behaviour of several dead Persons who have been guilty of very great Outrages and Disorders and by that Means elaps'd the proper Time of their In∣terrment and having on the other Hand received many Appeals from the aforesaid dead Persons wherein they desire to be heard before such their In∣terrment I have set apart  Wednesday  the st Instant as an extraordinary CourtDay for the hearing both Parties If therefore any one can alledge why they or any of their Acquaintance should or should not be buried I desire they may be ready with their Witnesses at that Time or that they will for ever after hold their Tongues  N B  Thus is the last Hearing on this Subject  The TATLER N  o    Quae Lucis Miseris tam dira Cupido  Virg  From  Tuesday Dec  to  Thursd Dec    SheerLane  December  AS soon as I had placed my self in my Chair of Jud cature I order'd my Clerk Mr  Lil∣lie  to read to the Assembly who were gather'd together according to Notice a certain Declara∣tion by Way of Charge to open the Purpose of my Session which tended only to this Explana∣tion That as other Courts were often called to demand the Execution of Persons dead in Law  so this was held to give the last Orders relating to those who are dead in Reason The Solicitor of the new Company of Upholders near the  Hay∣market  appeared in Behalf of that useful Society and brought in an Accusation of a young Wo∣man who her self stood at the Bar before me Mr  Lillie  read her Indictment which was in Substance That whereas Mrs  Rebecca Pindust  of the Parish of St  Martin in the Fields  had by the Use of one Instrument called a Looking∣glass and by the further Use of certain Attire made either of Cambrick Muslin or other Li∣nen Wares upon her Head attained to such an evil Art and Magical Force in the Motion of her Eyes and Turn of her Countenance that she the said  Rebecca  had put to Death several young Men of the said Parish and that the said young Men had acknowledged in certain Papers commonly called Love Letters which were produced in Court gilded on the Edges and sealed with a particular Wax with certain amorous and en∣chanting Words wrought upon the said Seals that they died for the said  Rebecca  And whereas the said  Rebecca  persisted in the said evil Pra∣ctice this Way of Life the said Society constru∣ed to be according to former Edicts a State of Death and demanded an Order for the Interr∣ment of the said  Rebecca  I looked upon the Maid with great Humanity and desired her to make Answer to what was said against her She said It was indeed true that the had practised all the Arts and Means she could to dispose of her self happily in Marriage but thought she did not come under the Cen∣sure expressed in my Writings for the same and humbly hoped I would not condemn her for the Ignorance of her Accusers who according to their own Words had rather represented her kil∣ling than dead She further alledged That the Expressions mentioned in the Papers written to  her were become meer Words and that she had been always ready to marry any of those who said they died for her but that they made their Escape as soon as they found themselves pitied or believed She ended her Discourse by desi∣ring I would for the future settle the Meaning of the Words  I Die  in Letters of Love  Mrs  Pindust  behaved her self with such an Air of Innocence that she easily gained Credit and was acquitted Upon which Occasion I gave it as a standing Rule That any Persons who in any Letter Billet or Discourse should tell a Woman he died for her should if she pleased be obliged to live with her or be immediately interred upon such their own Confession without Bail or Main∣prize  It happen'd that the very next who was brought before me was one of her Admirers who was indicted upon that very Head A Let∣ter which he acknowledged to be his own Hand was read in which were the following Words  Cruel Creature I die for you  It was observable that he took Snuff all the Time his Accusation was reading I asked him How he came to use these Words if he were not a dead Man He told me He was in Love with the Lady and did not know any other Way of telling her so and that all his Acquaintance took the same Method Tho' I was moved with Compassion towards him by reason of the Weakness of his Parts yet for Example's Sake I was

in Company with his Mi∣stress  and say nothing to her Dost thou call breaking a Jest telling a Lie Ha Is that thy Wisdom old Stiffrump ha He was going on with this insipid Commonplace Mirth sometimes opening his Box sometimes shutting it then viewing the Picture on the Lid and then the Workmanship of the Hinge when in the midst of his Eloquence I order'd his Box to be taken from him upon which he was immediately struck speechless and carried off stonedead  The next who appeared was a hale old Fel∣low of Sixty He was brought in by his Rela∣tions who desired Leave to bury him Upon re∣quiring a distinct Account of the Prisoner a cre∣dible Witness deposed That he always rose at Ten of the Clock played with his Car till Twelve smoaked Tobacco till One was at Din∣ner till Two then took another Pipe played at Backgammon till Six talked of one Madam  Frances  an old Mistress of his till Eight re∣peated the same Account at the Tavern till Ten then returned Home took t'other Pipe and then to Bed I asked him What he had to say for himself As to what said he they mention concerning Madam  Frances  I did not care for hearing a  Canterbury  Tale and therefore thought my self seasonably interrupted by a young Gen∣tleman who appeared in the Behalf of the old Man and prayed an Arrest of Judgment for that he the said young Man held certain Lands by his the said old Man's Life Upon this the Solicitor of the Upholders took an Occasion to demand him also and thereupon produced seve∣ral Evidences that witnessed to his Life and Con∣versation It appeared That each of them divi∣ded their Hours in Matters of equal Moment and Importance to themselves and to the Publick They rose at the same Hour While the old Man was playing with his Cat the young One was looking out of his Window while the old Man  was smoaking his Pipe the young Man was rub∣bing his Teeth while One was at Dinner the Other was dressing while One was at Back∣gammon the Other was at Dinner while the old Fellow was talking of Madam  Frances  the young One was either at Play or toasting Women whom he never convers'd with The only Difference was That the young Man had never been good for any Thing the old Man a Man of Worth be∣fore he knew Madam  Frances  Upon the Whole I order'd them to be both interred together with Inscriptions proper to their Characters signifying That the old Man died in the Year and was buried in the Year And over the young One it was said That he departed this World in the th Year of his Death  The next Class of Criminals were Authors in Prose and Verse Those of them who had pro∣duced any stillborn Work were immediately dismissed to their Burial and were followed by others who notwithstanding some sprightly Is∣sue in their Lifetime had given Proofs of their Death by some Posthumous Children that bore no Resemblance to their elder Brethren As for those who were the Fathers of a mixed Progeny provided always they could prove the last to be a live Child they escaped with Life but not without Loss of Limbs for in this Case I was satisfied with Amputation of the Parts which were mortified  These were followed by a great Crowd of su∣perannuated Benchers of the Inns of Court Se∣nior Fellows of Colleges and defunct Statesmen all whom I order'd to be decimated indifferent∣ly allowing the rest a Reprieve for one Year with a Promise of a free Pardon in case of Re∣suscitation  There were still great Multitudes to be exami∣ned but finding it very late I adjourned the Court not without the secret Pleasure that I had  done my Duty and furnished out an handsome Execution  Going out of the Court I received a Letter informing me That in Pursuance of the Edict of Justice in one of my late Visions all those of the Fair Sex began to appear pregnant who had ran any Hazard of it as was manifest by a particu∣lar Swelling in the Petticoats of several Ladies in and about this great City I must confess I do not attribute the Rising of this Part of the Dress to this Occasion yet must own that I am very much disposed to be offended with such a new and unaccountable Fashion I shall however pro∣nounce nothing upon it till I have examined all that can be said for and against it And in the mean Time think fit to give this Notice to the fair Ladies who are now making up their Win∣terSuits that they may abstain from all Dresses of that Kind till they shall find what Judgment will be passed upon them for it would very much trouble me that they should put themselves to an unnecessary Expence and could not but think my self to blame if I should hereafter forbid them the Wearing of such Garments when they have laid out Money upon them without having given them any previous Admonition  N B  A Letter of the th Instant about one of the th will be answered

does me particular Honours as being the chief Man in the Lane gave so very great a Thump at my Door last Night that I awakened at the Knock and heard my self complimented with the usual Sa∣kitation of  Good morrow Mr  Bickerstaff  Good morrow my Masters all  The Silence and Dark∣ness of the Night disposed me to be more than ordinarily serious and as my Attention was not drawn out among exterior Objects by the Avo∣cations of Sense my Thoughts naturally fell up∣on my self I was considering amidst the Stil∣ness of the Night What was the proper Employ∣ment of a Thinking Being What were the Per∣fections it should propose to it self And What the End it should aim at My Mind is of such a particular Cast that the Falling of a Shower of Rain or the Whistling of Wind at such a Time is apt to fill my Thoughts with something awful and solemn I was in this Disposition when our Bellman began his Midnight Homily which he has been repeating to us every Winter Night for these Twenty Years with the usual Exordium  Oh mortal Man thou that art born in Sin  Sentiments of this Nature which are in them∣selves just and reasonable however debased by  the Circumstances that accompany them do not fail to produce their natural Effect in a Mind that is not perverted and depraved by wrong No∣tions of Gallantry Politeness and Ridicule The Temper which I now found my self in as well as the Time of the Year put me in Mind of those Lines in  Shakespeare  wherein according to his agreeable Wildness of Imagination he has wrought a Country Tradition into a beautiful Piece of Poetry In the Tragedy of  Hamlet  where the Ghost vanishes upon the Cock's Crow∣ing he takes Occasion to mention its Crowing all Hours of the Night about  Christmas  Time and to insinuate a Kind of religious Veneration for that Season  It faded on the Crowing of the Cock  Some say That ever 'gainst that Season comes  Wherein our Saviour's Birth is celebrated  The Bird of Dawning singeth all Night long  And then say they no Spirit dares walk abroad  The Nights are wholesome then no Planets strike  No Fairy takes no Witch has Power to charm  So hallowed and so gracious to the Time  This admirable Author as well as the best and greatest Men of all Ages and of all Nations seems to have had his Mind throughly seasoned with Religion as is evident by many Passages in his Plays that would not be suffered by a mo∣dern Audience and are therefore certain In∣stances that the Age he lived in had a much greater Sense of Virtue than the present  It is indeed a melancholy Reduction to consider That the  British  Nation which is now at a greater Height of Glory for its Councils and Conquests than it ever was before should distinguish it self by a certain Looseness of Principles and a Falling off from those Schemes of Thinking which con∣duce to the Happiness and Perfection of humane Nature This Evil comes upon us from the Works  of a few solemn Blockheads that meet together with the Zeal and Seriousness of Apostles to ex∣tirpate common Sense and propagate Infidelity These are the Wretches who without any Show of Wit Learning or Reason publish their crude Conceptions with an Ambition of appearing more wise than the rest of Mankind upon no other Pre∣tence than that of dissenting from them One gets by Heart a Catalogue of Title Pages and Editions and immediately to become conspicuous declares that he is an Unbeliever Another knows how to write a Receipt or cut up a Dog and forthwith argues against the Immortality of the Soul I have known many a little Wit in the Ostenta∣tion of his Parts rally the Truth of the Scripture who was not able to read a Chapter in it These poor Wretches talk Blasphemy for want of Dis∣course and are rather the Objects of Scorn or Pity than of our Indignation but the grave Dis∣putant that reads and writes and spends all his Time in convincing himself and the World that he is no better than a Brute ought to be whipped out of a Government as a Blot to a civil Society and a Defamer of Mankind I love to consider an Infidel whether distinguished by the Title of Deist Atheist or FreeThinker in Three diffe∣rent Lights in his Solitudes his Afflictions and his last Moments  A wise Man that lives up to the Principles of Reason and Virtue if one considers him in his Solitude as taking in the System of the Universe observing the mutual Dependance and Harmony by which the whole Frame of it hangs together beating down his Passions or swelling his Thoughts with magnificent Idea's of Providence makes a nobler Figure in the Eye of an intelligent Being than the greatest Conqueror amidst all the Pomps and Solemnities of a Triumph On the contrary there is not a more ridiculous Animal than an Atheist in his Retirement His Mind is incapable  of Rapture or Elevation He can only consider himself as an insignificant Figure in a Landskip and wandring up and down in a Field or a Mea∣dow under the same Terms as the meanest Ani∣mals about him and as subject to as total a Mor∣tality as they with this Aggravation That he is the only one amongst 'em who lies under the Apprehension of it  In Distresses he must be of all Creatures the most helpless and forlorn he feels the whole Pressure of a present Calamity without being re∣lieved by the Memory of any Thing that is pas∣sed or the Prospect of any Thing that is to come Annihilation is the greatest Blessing that he pro∣poses to himself and an Halter or a Pistol the only Refuge he can fly to But if you would be∣hold one of these Goomy Miscreants in his poor∣est Figure you must consider him under the Ter∣rors or at the Approach of Death  About Thirty Years ago I was a Shipboard with one of these Vermin when there arose a brisk Gale which could frighten no Body but himself Upon the Rowling of the Ship he fell upon his Knees and confessed to the Chaplain that he had been a vile Atheist and had denied a Supreme Being ever since he came to his Estate The good Man was astoni∣shed and a Report immediately ran thro' the Ship That there was an Atheist upon the UpperDeck Several of the common Seamen who had never heard the Word before thought it had been some strange Fish but they were more surprised when they saw it was a Man and heard out of his own Mouth That he never beheved till that Day that there was a God As he lay in the Agonies of Confession one of the honest Tarrs whispered to the Boatswain That it would be a good Deed to heave him over Board But we were now within Sight of Port when of a sudden the Wind fell and the Penitent relapsed begging all of us that  were present as we were Gentlemen not to say any Thing of what had passed  He had not been ashore above Two Days when one of the Company began to rally him upon his Devotion on Shipboard which the other denied in so high Terms that it produced the Lie on both Sides and ended in a Duel The Atheist was run through the Body and after some Loss of Blood became as good a Christian as he was at Sea till he found that his Wound was not mortal He is at present one of the Free Thinkers of the Age and now writing a Pamphlet against several re∣ceiv'd Opinions concerning the Existence of Fairies  As I have taken upon me to censure the Faults of the Age and Country which I live in I should have thought my self inexcusable to have passed over this Crying one which is the Subject of my present Discourse I shall therefore from Time to Time give my Countrymen particular Cautions against this Distemper of the Mind that is almost become fashionable and by that Means more likely to spread I have somewhere either read or heard a very memorable Sentence That a Man would be a most insupportable Monster should he have the Faults that are incident to his Years Constitution Profession Family Religion Age and Country and yet every Man is in Danger of them all For this Reason as I am an old Man I take particular Care to avoid being covetous and telling long Stories As I am Cholerick I forbear not only Swearing but all Interjections of Fretting as Pugh Pish and the like As I am a Layman I resolve not to conceive an A version for a wise and a good Man because his Coat is of a different Colour from mine As I am de∣scended of the ancient Family of the  Bickerstaffs  I never call a Man of Merit an Upstart As a Pro∣testant I do not suffer my Zeal so far to transport me as to name the Pope and the Devil together As I am fallen into this degenerate Age I guard  my self particularly against the Folly I have been now speaking of And as I am an  Englishman  I am very cautious not to hate a Stranger or de∣spise a poor  Palatine  The TATLER N  o    Accedat Suavitas quaedam oportet Sermonum at∣que Morum haudquaquam mediocre Condimen∣tum Amicitiae Tristitia autem in omni Re Severitas absit Habet illa quidem

Letters this Morn∣ing I chanced to cast my Eye upon the following one which came to my Hands about Two Months ago from an old Friend of mine who as I have since learned was the Person that writ the agreeable Epistle inserted in my Paper of the Third of the last Month It is of the same Turn with the other and may be look∣ed upon as a Specimen of  Right Country Letters  SIR  THis sets out to you from my SummerHouse up∣on the Terras where I am enjoying a few Hours Sun shine the seanty sweet Remains of a fiue Autumn The Year is almost at the lowest so that in all Appearance the rest of my Letters be∣tween this and Spring will be dated from my Par∣lour  Fire where the little fond Prattle of a Wife and Children will so often break in upon the Con∣nexion of my Thoughts that you'll easily discover it in my Style If this Winter should prove as severe as the last I can tell you beforehand that I am likely to be a very miserable Man through the perverse Temper of my eldest Boy When the Frost was in its Extremity you must know that most of the Blackbirds Robins and Finches of the Parish whose Musick had entertained me in the Summer took Refuge under my Roof Upon this my Care was to rise every Morning before Day to set open my Windows for the Reception of the Cold and the Hungry whom at the same Time I relieved with a very plentiful Alms by strewing Corn and Seeds upon the Floors and Shelves But  Dicky  without any Regard to the Laws of Hospitality considered the Casements as so many Traps and used every Bird as a Prisoner at Discretion Never did Ty∣rant exercise more various Cruelties Some of the poor Creatures he chased to Death about the Room others he drove into the Jaws of a Bloodthirsty Cat and even in his great st Acts of Mercy either clipped the Wings or singed the Tails of his inno∣cent Captives You'll laugh when I tell you I sympathiz'd with every Bird in its Misfortunes but I believe y  u'll think me in the Right for be∣wailing the Child's unlucky Humour On the other Hand I am extremely  sed to see his youn∣ger Brother carry an universal Benevol  nce towards every Thing that has L  fe Wh  n he was between Four and Five Years old I caught him weeping over a beautiful Butt  fly which he chanced to kill as he was playing with it and I am informed that this Morning he has given his Brother Three Halfpence which was his whole Estate to spare the L  fe of a T  m Tit These are at present the Matters of greatest Moment within my Observation and I know are too trifling to be communicated to  any but so wise a Man as your self and from one who has the Happiness to be  Your most Faithful And most Obedient Servant  The best Critick that ever wrote speaking of some Passages in  Homer  which appear extravagant or frivolous says indeed that they are Dreams but the Dreams of  Jupiter  My Friend's Let∣ter appears to me in the same Light One sees him in an idle Hour but at the same Time in the idle Hour of a wise Man A great Mind has something in it too severe and forbidding that is not capable of giving it self such little Re∣laxations and of condescending to these agree∣able Ways of Trifling  Tully  when he cele∣brates the Friendship of  Scipio  and  Lelius  who were the greatest as well as the politest Men of their Age represents it as a beautiful Pas∣sage in their Retirement that they used to ga∣ther up Shells on the Seashore and amuse themselves with the Variety of Shape and Co∣lour which they met with in those little unre∣garded Works of Nature The great  Agesilaus  could be a Companion to his own Children and was surprized by the Ambassadors of  Sparta  as he was riding among them upon an HobbyHorse  Augustus  indeed had no PlayFellows of his own begetting but is said to have pas∣sed many of his Hours with little  Moorish  Boys at a Game of Marbles not unlike our mod rn Taw There is methinks a Pleasure in see∣ing great Men thus fall into the Rank of Man∣kind and entertain themselves with Diversions and Amusements that are agreeable to the very weakest of the Species I must frankly confess that it is to me a Beauty in  Cato  's Character that he would drink a chearful Bottle with a Friend and I cannot but own that I have  seen with great Delight one of the most celebra∣ted Authors of the last Age feeding the Ducks in St  James  's Park By Instances or this Na∣ture the Heroes the Statesmen the Philoso∣phers become as it were familiar with us and grow the more amiable the less they endeavour to appear awful A Man who always acts in the Severity of Wisdom or the Haughtiness of Quality seems to move in a personated art It looks too Const ained and Theatrical for a Man to be always in that Character which distinguishes him from others Besides that the Slackening and Unbending our Minds on some Occasions makes them exert themselves with greater Vi∣gour and Alacrity when they return to their pro∣per and natural State  As this innocent Way of passing a leisure Hour is not only consistent with a great Chara∣cter but very graceful in it so there are Two Sorts of People to whom I would most earnestly recommend it The First are those who are un∣easy out of Want of Thought the Second are those who are so out of a Turbulence of Spirit The First a e the impertinent and the Second the dangerous Part of Mankind  It grieves me to the very Heart when I see several young Gentlemen descended of honest Parents run up and down hurrying from one End of the Town to the other calling in at every Place of Resort without being able to fix a Qua ter of an Hour in any and in a particular Haste without knowing for what It would methinks be some Consolation if I could per∣swade these precipitate young Gentlemen to compose this Restlesness of Mind and apply themselves to any Amusement how trivial so∣ever that might give them Employment and keep them out of Harm's Way They cannot imagine how great a Relief it would be to them if they could grow sedate enough to play for  Two or Three Hours at a Game of Pushpin But these busy idle Animals are only their own Tormentors The Turbulent and Dangerous are for embroiling Councils stirring up Seditions and subverting Constitutions out of a meer Rest∣lesness of Temper and an Insensibility of all the Pleasures of Life that are calm and innocent It is impossible for a Man to be so much em∣ployed in any Scene of Action as to have great and good Affairs enough to fill up his whole Time there will still be Casms and empty Spaces in which a working Mind will employ it self to its own Prejudice or that of others un∣less it can be at Ease in the Exercise of such Actions as are in themselves indifferent How often have I wished for the Good of the Na∣tion That several famous Politicians could take any Pleasure in feeding Ducks I look upon an able Statesman out of Business like a huge Whale that will endeavour to overturn the Ship unless he has an empty Cask to play with  But to return to my good Friend and Corres∣pondent I am afraid we shall both be laughed at when I confess that we have often gone out into the Field to look upon a Bird'sNest and have more than once taken an Evening's Walk together on purpose to see the Sun set I shall conclude with my Answer to his foregoing Let∣ter  Dear SIR  I Thank you for your obliging Letter and your Kindness to the Distressed who will doubtless express their Gratitude to you themselves the next Sp  ng As for  Dick  the Tyrant I must desire you will put a Stop to his Proceedings and at the same Time take Care that his little Brother be no Loser by his Mercy to the  TomTit  For my own  Part I am excluded all Conversation with Am∣mals that delight only in a Country Life and am therefore forced to entertain my self as well as I can with my little Dog and Cat They both of 'em sit by my Fire every Night expecting my coming Home with impatience and at my Entrance ne∣ver fail of running up to me and bidding me wel∣come each of 'em in his proper Language As they have been bred up together from their Infan∣cy and seen no other Company they have learned each others Manners so that the Dog often gave himself the Airs of a Cat and the Cat in several of her Motions and Gestures affects the Behaviour of the little Dog When they are at Play I often make one with them and sometimes please my self with considering how much Reason and Instinct are capable of delighting each other

Petition on this Subject was presented to me this Morning  The humble Petition of  William Jingle  Coach∣maker and Chairmaker of the Liberty of  West∣minster  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  SHEWETH  That upon the late Invention of Mrs  Cathe∣rine CrossStitch  Mantoe maker the Petticoats of Ladies were too wide for entring into any Coach or Cha r which was in Use before the said Invention  That for the Service of the said Ladies your Petitioner has built a round Chair in the Form of a Lanthorn Six Yards and an half in Cir∣cumference with a Stool in the Centre of it the said Vehicle being so contrived as to re∣ceive the Passenger by opening in two in the Middle and closing mathematically when she is seated  That your Petitioner has also invented a Coach for the Reception of one Lady only who is to be let in at the Top  That the said Coach has been tried by a La∣dy's Woman in one of these full Petticoats who was let down from a Balcony and drawn up again by Pullies to the great Satisfaction of her Lady and all who beheld her  Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays That for the Encouragement of Ingenuity and useful Inventions he may be heard before you pass Sentence upon the Petticoats afore∣said  And your Petitioner  c  I have likewise received a Female Petition sign∣ed by several Thousands praying That I would not any longer defer giving Judgment in the Case of the Petticoat many of them having Put off the making new Clothes till such Time as they know what Verdict will pass upon it I do therefore hereby certify to all whom it may concern That I do design to set apart  Tuesday  next for the final Determination of that Matter having already or∣dered a Jury of Matrons to be impannelled for the clearing up of any difficult Points that may a∣rise in the Trial  Being informed That several Dead Men in and about this City do keep out of the Way and abscond for Fear of being buried and being willing to re∣spite their Interrment in Consideration of their Fa∣milies and in Hopes of their Amendment I shall allow them certain PrivilegedPlaces where they may appear to one another without causing any Lett or Molestation to the Living

Studiis pulcherrimum huma∣nissimum existimo Severitatem Comitatemque miscere ne illa in Tristitiam haec in Petulantiam procedat  Plin Epist  From  Thursd Dec  to  Saturd Dec    SheerLane  December  I Was walking about my Chamber this Morn∣ing in a very gay Humour when I saw a Coach stop at my Door and a Youth about Fif∣teen alighting out of it whom I perceived to be the eldest Son of my BosomFriend that I gave some Account of in my Paper of the th of the last Month I felt a sensible Pleasure rising in me at the Sight of him my Acquaintance having begun with his Father when he was just such a Stripling and about that very Age When he came up to me he took me by the Hand and burst out in Tears I was extremely moved and immediately said Child How does your Father  do He began to reply My MotherBut could not go on for weeping I went down with him into the Coach and gathered out of him That his Mother was then dying and that while the holy Man was doing the last Offices to her he had taken that Time to come and call me to his Father who he said would certainly break his Heart if I did not go and comfort him The Child's Discretion in coming to me of his own Head and the Tenderness he showed for his Pa∣rents would have quite overpowered me had I not resolved to fortify my self for the seasonable Performances of those Duties which I owed to my Friend As we were going I could not but reflect upon the Character of that excellent Wo∣man and the Greatness of his Grief for the Loss of one who has ever been the Support to him under all other Afflictions How thought I will he be able to bear the Hour of her Death that could not when I was lately with him speak of a Sickness which was then past without Sor∣row We were now got pretty far into  Westm n∣ster  and arrived at my Friend's House At the Door of it I met  Favonius  not without a secret Satisfaction to find he had been there I had formerly conversed with him at this House and as he abounds with that Sort of Virtue and Knowledge which makes Religion beautiful and never leads the Conversation into the Vio∣lence and Rage of PartyDisputes I listened to him with great Pleasure Our Discourse chan∣ced to be upon the Subject of Death which he treated with such a Strength of Reason and Greatness of Soul that instead of being terrible it appeared to a Mind rightly cultivated altoge∣ther to be contemned or rather to be desired As I met him at the Door I saw in his Face a certain Glowing of G ief and Humanity heigh∣ten'd with an Air of Fortitude and Resolution which as I afterwards found had such an irre∣sistible  Force as to suspend the Pains of the Dy∣ing and the Lamentation of the nearest Friends who attended her I went up directly to the Room where she lay and was met at the En∣trance by my Friend who notwithstanding his Thoughts had been composed a little before at the Sight of me turned away his Face and wept The little Family of Children renewed the Ex∣pressions of their Sorrow according to their se∣veral Ages and Degrees of Understanding The eldest Daughter was in Tears busied in Atten∣dance upon her Mother others were kneeling about the Bedside And what troubled me most was to see a little Boy who was too young to know the Reason weeping only because his Si∣sters did The only one in the Room who seem∣ed resigned and comforted was the dying Per∣son At my Approach to the Bedside she told me with a low broken Voice This is kindly doneTake Care of your FriendDon't go from him She had before taken Leave of her Husband and Children in a Manner proper for so solemn a Parting and with a Gracefulness peculiar to a Woman of her Character My Heart was torn in Pieces to see the Husband on one Side suppressing and keeping down the Swellings of his Grief for Fear of disturbing her in her last Moments and the Wife even at that Time concealing the Pains she endured for Fear of encreasing his Affliction She kept her Eyes upon him for some Moments after she grew speechless and soon after closed them for ever In the Moment of her Departure my Friend who had thus far commanded himself gave a deep Groan and fell into a Swoon by her Bed∣side The Distraction of the Children who thought they saw both their Parents expiring to∣gether and now lying dead before them would have melted the hardest Heart but they soon perceived their Father recover whom I helped  to remove into another Room with a Resolution to accompany him till the first Pangs of his Af∣fliction were abated I knew Consolation would now be impertinent and therefore contented my self to sit by him and condole with him in Si∣lence For I shall here use the Method of an ancient Author who in one of his Epistles rela∣ting the Virtues and Death of  Macrinus  's Wife expresses himself thus  "I shall suspend my Ad∣vice to this best of Friends till he is made capa∣ble of receiving it by those Three great Reme∣dies  Necessitas ipsa Dies longa Satietas Do∣loris  The Necessity of Submission Length of Time and Satiety of Grief'  In the mean Time I cannot but consider with much Commiseration the melancholy State of one who has had such a Part of himself torn from him and which he misses in every Cir∣cumstance of Life His Condition is like that of one who has lately lost his Right Arm and is every Moment offering to help himself with it He does not appear to himself the same Per∣son in his House at his Table in Company or in Retirement and loses the Relish of all the Pleasures and Diversious that were before enter∣taining to him by her Participation of them The most agreeable Objects recall the Sorrow for her with whom he used to enjoy them This ad∣ditional Satisfaction from the Tast of Pleasures in the Society of one we love is admirably de∣scribed in  Milton  who represents  Eve  though in Paradise it self no further pleased with the beau∣tiful Objects around her than as she sees them in Company with  Adam  in that Passage so inex∣pressibly charming  With Thee conversing I forget all Time  All Seasons and their Change all please alike  Sweet is the Breath of Morn her Rising sweet  With Charm of earliest Birds pleasant the Sun  When first on this delightful Land he spreads  His Orient Beams on Herb Tree Fruit and Flower  Glist'ring with Dew fragrant the fertile Earth  After soft Showers and sweet the coming on  Of grateful Evening mild the silent Night  With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon  And these the Gems of Heaven her Starry Train  But neither Breath of Morn when she ascends  With Charm of earliest Birds nor rising Sun  In this delightful Land nor Herb Fruit Flower  Glist'ring with Dew nor Fragrance after Showers  Nor grateful Evening mild nor silent Night  With this her solemn Bird nor Walk by Moon  Or glittering Starlight without Thee is sweet  The Variety of Images in this Passage is in∣finitely pleasing and the Recapitulation of each particular Image with a little varying of the Ex∣pression makes one of the finest Turns of Words that I have ever seen Which I rather mention because Mr  Dryden  has said in his Preface to  Ju∣venal  That he could meet with no Turn of Words in  Milton  It may further be observed That though the Sweetness of these Verses has something in it of a Pastoral yet it excels the ordinary Kind as much as the Scene of it is above an ordinary Field or Meadow I might here since I am ac∣cidentally led into this Subject show several Pas∣sages in  Milton  that have as excellent Turns of this Nature as any of our  English  Poets whatso∣ever but shall only mention that which follows in which he describes the Fallen Angels engaged in the intricate Disputes of Predestination Free∣will and Foreknowledge and to humour the Perplexity makes a Kind of Labyrinth in the very Words that describe it  Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd  In Thoughts more elevate and reason'd high  Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate  Fix'd Fate Freewill Foreknowledge absolute  And found no End in
