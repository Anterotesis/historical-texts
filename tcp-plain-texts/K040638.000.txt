 Lionel and Clarissa A COMIC OPERA As it is Performed at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN in Catharinestreet Strand MDCCXLVIII P s d  ADVERTISEMENT  SINCE the printing of this little Piece it has been intimated to the Author that he is likely to suffer from some ill Will occasioned by a very faulty and very unfortunate Opera of his represented last Winter but he begs leave to observe that it is against the Laws of  England  to try a Man twice for the same Fact and more so after Punishment has been inflicted He thinks it can hardly be necessary to say that he never in any of his Writings intended to give the least Offence And as his trifling Productions have more than once been lucky enough to be honoured with the Approbation of the Public he flatters himself should he again be found capable of affording them an innocent Entertainment that those to whose Justice he most readily subscribes will not refuse him an Opportunity of appealing to their Candour

a newspaper at a little distance from the teatable sits JENKINS and on the opposite side DIANA who appears playing upon a harpsicord A Girl attending  A  AH how delightful the morning  How sweet are the prospects it yields  Summer luxuriant adorning  The gardens the groves and the fields  Be grateful to the season  It's pleasures let's employ  Kind Nature gives and Reason  Permits us to enjoy  Col  Well said Dy thank you Dy This master Jenkins is the way I make my daughter entertain me every morning at breakfast Come here and kiss me you slut come here and kiss me you baggage  Dian  Lord papa you call one such names  Col  A fine girl master Jenkins a devilish fine girl she has got my eye to a twinkle There's fire for you spiritI design to marry her to a Duke how much money do you think a Duke would expect with such a wench  Jen  Why Colonel with submission I think there is no occasion to go out of our own country here we have never a Duke in it I believe but we have many an honest gentleman who in my opinion might deserve the young lady  Col  So you would have me marry Dy to a country 'squire eh How say you to this Dy would not you rather be married to a Duke  Dian  So my husband's a rake papa I don't care what he is  Col  A rake you damned confounded little baggage why you wou'd not wish to marry a rake wou'd you So her husband is a rake she does not care what he is Ha ha ha ha  Dian  Well but listen to me papaWhen you go out with your gun do you take any pleasure in shooting the poor tame ducks and chickens in your yard No the partridge the pheasant the woodcock are the game there is some sport in bringing them down because they are wild and it is just the same with an husband or a lover I would not waste powder and shot to wound one of your sober pretty behaved gentlemen but to hit a libertine extravagant madcap fellow to take him upon the wing  Col  Do you hear her master Jenkins Ha ha ha  Jen  Well but good Colonel what do you say to my worthy and honourable patron here Sir John Flowerdale He has an estate of eight thousand pounds a year as well paid rents as any in the kingdom and but one only daughter to enjoy it and yet he is willing you see to give this daughter to your son  Dian  Pray Mr Jenkins how does Miss Clarissa and our university friend Mr Lionel That is the only grave young man I ever liked and the only handsome one I ever was acquainted with that did not make love to me  Col  Ay master Jenkins who is this Lionel They say he is a damn'd witty knowing fellow and egad I think him well enough for one brought up in a college  Jen  His father was a general officer a particular friend of Sir John's who like many more brave men that live and die in defending their country left little else than honour behind him Sir John sent this young man at his own expence to Oxford where while his son lived they were upon the same footing and since our young gentleman's death which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago he has continued him there During the vacation he is come to pay us a visit and Sir John intends that he shall shortly take orders for a very considerable benefice in the gift of the family the present incumbent of which is an aged man  Dian  The last time I was at at your house he was teaching Miss Clarissa mathematics and philosophy Lord what a strange brain I have If I was to sit down to distract myself with such studies  Col  Go hussey let some of your brother's rascals inform their master that he has been long enough at his toilet here is a message from Sir John Flowerdale You a brain for mathematics indeed We shall have women wanting to head our regiments tomorrow or next day  Dian  Well papa and suppose we did I believe in a battle of the sexes you men would hardly get the better of us  To rob them of strength when wise Nature thought fit  By women to stilt do her duty  Instead of a sword she endu'd them with wit  And gave them a shield in their beauty  Sound sound then the trumpet both sexes to arms  Our tyrants at once and protectors  We quickly shall see whether courage or charms  Decide for the Helens or Hectors  SCENE II  Colonel OLDBOY JENKINS  Col  Well master Jenkins don't you think now that a Nobleman a Duke an Earl or a Marquis might be content to share his titleI say you understand mewith a sweetener of thirty or forty thousand pounds to pay off mortgages Besides there's a prospect of my whole estate for I dare swear her brother will never have any children  Jen  I should be concerned at that Colonel when there are two such fortunes to descend to his heirs as yours and Sir John Flowerdale's  Col  Why look you master Jenkins Sir John Flowerdale is an honest gentleman our families are nearly related we have been neighbours time out of mind and if he and I have an odd dispute now and then it is not for want of a cordial esteem at bottom He is going to marry his daughter to my son she is a beautiful girl an elegant girl a sensible girl a worthy girl anda word in your eardamn me if I aint very sorry for her  Jen  Sorry Colonel  Col  Aybetween ourselves master Jenkins my son won't do  Jen  How do you mean  Col  I tell you master Jenkins he won't dohe is not the thing a prigAt sixteen years old or thereabouts he was a bold sprightly boy as you should see in a thousand could drink his pint of port or his bottle of claretnow he mixes all his wine with water  Jen  Oh if that be his only fault Colonel he will ne'er make the worse husband I'll answer for it  Col  You know my wife is a woman of quality I was prevailed upon to send him to be brought up by her brother Lord Jessamy who had no children of his own and promised to leave him an estatehe has got the estate indeed but the fellow has taken  his Lordship's name for it Now master Jenkins I would be glad to know how the name of Jessamy is better than that of Oldboy  Jen  Well but Colonel it is allowed on all hands that his Lordship has given your son an excellent education  Col  Psha he sent him to the university and to travel forsooth but what of that I was abroad and at the university myself and never a rush the better for either I quarelled with his Lordship about six years before his death and so had not an opportunity of seeing how the youth went on if I had master Jenkins I would no more have suffered him to be made such a monkey ofHe has been in my house but three days and it is all turned topsy turvy by him and his rascally servantsthen his chamber is like a perfumer's shop with washballs pastes and pomatumand do you know he had the impudence to tell me yesterday at my own table that I did not know how to behave myself  Jen  Pray Colonel how does my Lady Mary  Col  What my wife In the old way master Jenkins always complaining ever something the matter with her head or her back or her legsbut we have had the devil to pay latelyshe and I did not speak to one another for three weeks  Jen  How so Sir  Col  A little affair of jealousyyou must know my gamekeeper's daughter has had a child and the plaguy baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me Upon my soul it is a fine fat chubby infant as ever I set my eyes on I have sent it to nurse and between you and me I believe I shall leave it a fortune  Jen  Ah Colonel you will never give over  Col  You know my Lady has a pretty vein of poetry she writ me an heroic epistle upon it where she calls me her dear false Damon so I let her cry a little promised to do so no more and now we are as good friends as ever  Jen  Well Colonel I must take my leave I have delivered my message and Sir John may expect the pleasure of your company to dinner  Col  Ay ay we'll comepox o' ceremony among friends But won't you stay to see my son I have sent to him and suppose he will be here as soon as his valetdechambre will give him leave  Jen  There is no occasion good Sir present my humble respects that's all  Col  Well but zounds Jenkins you must not go till you drink somethinglet you and I have a bottle of hock  Jen  Not for the world Colonel I never touch any thing strong in a morning  Col  Never touch any thing strong Why one bottle won't hurt you man this is old and as mild as milk  Jen  Well but Colonel pray excuse me  To tell you the truth  In the days of my youth  As mirth and nature bid  I lik'd a glass  And I lov'd a lass  And I did as younkers did  But now I am old  With grief be it told  I must those freaks forbear  At sixtythree  'Twixt you and me  A man grows worse for wear  SCENE III  Mr  JESSAMY  Lady  MARY OLDBOY  and then Colonel  OLDBOY  Lady M  Shut the door why don't you shut the door there Have you a mind I should catch my death This house is absolutely the cave of Aeolus one had as good live on the eddy stone or in a windmill  Mr Jess  I thought they told your Ladyship that there was a messenger here from Sir John Flowerdale  Col  Well Sir and so there was but he had not patience to wait upon your curlingirons Mr Jenkins was here Sir John Flowerdale's steward who has lived in the family these forty years  Mr Jess  And pray Sir might not Sir John Flowerdale have come himself if he had been acquainted with the rules of good breeding he would have known that I ought to have been visited  Lady M  Upon my word Colonel this is a solecism  Col  'Sblood my Lady it's none Sir John Flowerdale came but last night from his sister's seat in the west and is a little out of order But I suppose he thinks he ought to appear before him with his daughter in one hand and his rentroll in the other and cry Sir pray do me the favour to accept them  Lady M  Nay but Mr Oldboy permit me to say  Col  He need not give himself so many affected airs I think it's very well if he gets such a girl for going for she's one of the handsomest and richest in this country and more than he deserves  Mr Jess  That's an exceeding fine china jar your Ladyship has got in the next room I saw the fellow of it the other day at Williams's and will send to my agent to purchase it it is the true matchless old blue and white Lady Betty Barebones has a couple that she gave an hundred guineas for on board an Indiaman but she reckons them at a hundred and twentyfive  on account of half a dozen plates four Nankeen beakers and a couple of shaking Mandarins that the customhouse officers took from under her petticoats  Col  Did you ever hear the like of this He's chattering about old china while I am talking to him of a fine girl I tell you what Mr Jessamy since that's the name you choose to be called by I have a good mind to knock you down  Mr Jess  Knock me down Colonel What do you mean I must tell you Sir this is a language to which I have not been accustomed and if you think proper to continue or repeat it I shall be under a necessity of quitting your house  Col  Quitting my house  Mr Jess  Yes Sir incontinently  Col  Why Sir am not I your father Sir and have not I a right to talk to you as I like I will sirrah But perhaps I mayn't be your father and I hope not  Lady M  Heavens and earth Mr Oldboy  Col  What's the mattter Madam I mean Madam that he might have been changed at nurse Madam and I believe he was  Mr Jess  Huh huh huh  Col  Do you laugh at me you saucy jacknapes  Lady M  Who's there somebody bring me a chair Really Mr Oldboy you throw my weakly frame into such repeated convulsionsbut I see your aim you want to lay me in my grave and you will very soon have that satisfaction  Col  I can't bear the sight of him  Lady M  Open that window give me air or I shall faint  Mr Jess  Hold hold let me tie a handkerchief about my neck first This cursed sharp north wind Antoine bring down my muff  Col  Ay do and his greatcoat  Lady M  Marg'ret some hartshorn My dear Mr Oldboy why will you fly out in this way when you know how it shocks my tender nerves  Col  'Sblood Madam its enough to make a man mad  Lady M  Hartshorn Hartshorn  Mr Jess  Colonel  Col  Do you hear the puppy  Mr Jess  Will you give me leave to ask you one question  Col  I don't know whether I will or not  Mr Jess  I should be glad to know that's all what single circumstance in my conduct carriage or figure you can possibly find fault withPerhaps I may be brought to reformPr'ythee let me hear from your own mouth then seriously what it is you do like and what it is you do not like  Col  Hum  Mr Jess  Be ingenuous speak and spare not  Col  You would know  Zounds Sir then I'll tell you without any jest  The thing of all things which I hate and detest  A coxcomb a fop  A dainty milksop  Who essenc'd and dizen'd from bottom to top  Looks just like a doll for a milliner's shop  A thing full of prate  And pride and conceit  All fashion no weight  Who shrugs and takes snuff  And carries a muff  A minikin  Finiking  French powderpuff  And now Sir I fancy I've told  enough  SCENE IV  Lady  MARY OLDBOY  Mr  JESSAMY  Mr Jess  What's the matter with the Colonel Madam does your ladyship know He seems a little disordered in his senses I don't think it would be amiss to take out a commission of lunacy against him  Lady M  Heigho don't be surprised my dear it was the same thing with my late dear brother Lord Jessamy they never could agree that good natured friendly soul knowing the delicacy of my constitution has often said sister Mary I pity you Not but your father has good qualities and I assure you I remember him a very fine gentleman himself In the year of the hardfrost one thousand seven hundred and thirtynine when he first paid his addresses to me he was called agreeable Jack Oldboy though I married him without the consent of your noble grandfather  Mr Jess  I think he ought to be proud of me I believe there's many a Duke nay Prince who would esteem themselves happy in having such a son  Lady M  Yes my dear but your sister was always your father's favourite he intends to give her a prodigious fortune and sets his heart upon seeing her a woman of quality  Mr Jess  He should wish to see her look a little like a gentlewoman first When she was in London last winter I am told she was taken notice of by a few men But she wants air manner  Lady M  And has not a bit of the genius of our family and I never knew a woman of it but herself without I have tried her about three years ago I set her to translate a little French song I found she had not even an idea of versification and she put down love and joy for rhymeso I gave her over  Mr Jess  Why indeed she appears to have more of the Thalestris than the Sapho about her  Lady M  Well my dear I must go and dress myself though I protest I am fitter for my bed than my coach And condescend to the Colonel a littleDo my dear if it be only to oblige your mamma  SCENE V  Mr  JESSAMY  Let me consider I am going to visit a country Baronet here who would fain prevail upon me to marry his daughter the old gentleman has heard of my parts and understanding Miss of my figure and address But suppose I should not like her when I see her Why positively then I will not have her the treaty's at an end and sans compliment we break up the congress But won't that be cruel after having suffered her to flatter herself with hopes and shewing myself to her She's a strange dowdy I dare believe however she brings provision with her for a separate maintenance  Antoine appretez la toilet I am going to spend a cursed day that I perceive already I wish it was over I dread it as much as a general election  When a man of fashion condescends  To herd among his country friends  They watch his looks his motions  One booby gapes another stares  And all he says does eats drinks wears  Must suit their rustic notions  But as for this brutish old clown here  S'death why did I ever come down here  The savage will now never quit me  Then a consort to take  For my family's sake  I'm in a fine jeopardy split me  SCENE VI  Changes to a Study in Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE's  House two Chairs and a Table with Globes and Mathematical Instruments  CLARISSA  enters followed by  JENNY  Clar  Immortal pow'rs protect me  Assist support direct me  Relieve a heart opprest  Ah why this palpitation  Cease busy perturbation  And let me let me rest  Jen  My dear lady what ails you  Clar  Nothing Jenny nothing  Jen  Pardon me Madam there is something ails you indeed Lord what signifies all the grandeur and riches in this world if they can't procure one content I am sure it vexes me to the heart so it does to see such a dear sweet worthy young Lady as you are pining yourself to death  Clar  Jenny you are a good girl and I am very much obliged to you for feeling so much on my account but in a little time I hope I shall be easier  Jen  Why now here to day Madam for fartain you ought to be merry to day when there's a fine gentleman coming to court you but if you like any one else better I am sure I wish you had him with all my soul  Clar  Suppose Jenny I was so unfortunate as to like a man without my father's approbation would you wish me married to him  Jen  I wish you married to any one Madam that could make you happy  Clar  Heigho  Jen  Madam Madam yonder's Sir John and Mr Lionel on the terras I believe they are coming up here Poor dear Mr Lionel he does not seem to  be in over great spirits either To be sure Madam it's no business of mine but I believe if the truth was known there are those in the house who wou'd give more than ever I shall be worth or any the likes of me to prevent the marriage of a sartain person that shall be nameless  Clar  What do you mean I don't understand you  Jen  I hope you are not angry Madam  Clar  Ah Jenny  Jen  Lauk Madam do you think when Mr Lionel's a clergyman he'll be obliged to cut off his hair I'm sure it will be a thousand pities for it is the sweetest colour and looks the nicest put up in a cue and your great puddingsleeves Lord they'll quite spoil his shape and the fall of his shoulders Well Madam if I was a Lady of large fortune I'll be hanged if Mr Lionel should be a parson if I could help it  Clar  I'm going into my dressingroomIt seems then Mr Lionel is a great favourite of yours but pray Jenny have a care how you talk in this manner to any one else  Jen  Me talk Madam I thought you knew me better and my dear Lady keep up your spirits I'm sure I have dressed you to day as nice as hands and pins can make you  I'm but a poor servant 'tis true Ma'am  But was I a lady like you Ma'am  In grief would I sit The dickens a bit  No faith I would search the world thro' Ma'am  To find what my liking could hit  Set in case a young man  In my fancy there ran  It might anger my friends and relations  But if I had regard  It should go very hard  Or I'd follow my own inclinations  SCENE VII  Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE LIONEL  Sir John  Indeed Lionel I will not hear of it What to run from us all of a sudden this way and at such a time too the eve of my daughter's wedding as I may call it when your company must be doubly agreeable as well as necessary to us I am sure you have no studies at present that require your attendance at Oxford I must therefore insist on your putting such thoughts out of your head  Lion  Upon my word Sir I have been so long from the university that it is time for me to think of returning It is true I have no absolute studies but really Sir I shall be obliged to you if you will give me leave to go  Sir John  Come come my dear Lionel I have for some time observed a more than ordinary gravity growing upon you and I am not to learn the reason of it I know to minds serious and well inclined like yours the sacred function you are about to embrace  Lion  Dear Sir your goodness to me of every kind is so great so unmeritted Your condescension your friendly attentionsin short Sir I want words to express my sense of obligations  Sir John  Fie fie no more of them By my last letters I find that my old friend the rector still continues in good health considering his advanced years You may imagine I am far from desiring the death of so worthy and pious a man yet I must own at this time I could wish you were in orders as you might then perform the ceremony of my daughter's marriage which would give me a secret satisfaction  Lion  No doubt Sir any office in my power that could be instrumental to the happiness of any of your family I should perform with pleasure  Sir John  Why really Lionel from the character of her intended husband I have no room to doubt but this match will make Clarissa perfectly happy to be sure the alliance is the most eligible for both families  Lion  If the gentleman is sensible of his happiness in the alliance Sir  Sir John  The fondness of a father is always suspected of partiality yet I believe I may venture to say that few young women will be found more unexceptionable than my daughter her person is agreeable her temper sweet her understanding good and with the obligations she has to your instruction  Lion  You do my endeavours too much honour Sir I have been able to add nothing to Miss Flowerdale's accomplishments but a little knowledge in matters of small importance to a mind already so well improved  Sir John  I don't think so a little knowledge even in those matters is necessary for a woman in whom I am far from considering ignorance as a desireable characteristic when intelligence is not attended with impertinent affectation it teaches them to judge with precision and gives them a degree of solidity necessary for the companion of a sensible man  Lion  Yonder's Mr Jenkins I fancy he's looking for you Sir  Sir John  I see him he's come back from Colonel Oldboy's I have a few words to say to him and will return to you again in a minute  SCENE VIII  LIONEL  afterwards  CLARISSA  and then  JENNY  who enters abruptly and runs out again    Lion  To be a burthen to one's self to wage continual war with one's own passions forced to combat unable to overcome But see she appears whose presence turns all my sufferings into transport and makes even misery itself delightful  Perhaps Madam you are not at leisure now otherwise if you thought proper we would resume the subject we were upon yesterday  Clar  I am sure Sir I give you a great deal of trouble  Lion  Madam you give me no trouble I should think every hour of my life happily employed in your service and as this is probably the last time I shall have the satisfaction of attending you upon the same occasion  Clar  Upon my word Mr Lionel I think myself extremely obliged to you and shall ever consider the enjoyment of your friendship  Lion  My friendship Madam can be of little moment to you but if the most perfect adoration if the warmest wishes for your felicity though I should never be witness of it if these Madam can have any merit to continue in your remembrance a man once honoured with a share of your esteem  Clar  Hold SirI think I hear somebody  Lion  If you please Madam we will turn over this celestial globe once moreHave you looked at the book I left you yesterday  Clar  Really Sir I have been so much disturbed in my thoughts for these two or three days past that I have not been able to look at any thing  Lion  I am sorry to hear that Madam I hope there was nothing particular to disturb you The care Sir  John takes to dispose of your hand in a manner suitable to your birth and fortune  Clar  I don't know SirI own I am disturbed I own I am uneasy there is something weighs upon my heart which I would feign disclose  Lion  Upon your heart Madam Did you say your heart  Clar  I did SirI  Jen  Madam Madam Here's a coach and six driving up the avenue It's colonel Oldboy's family and I believe the gentleman is in it that's coming to court youLord I must run and have a peep at him out of the window  Lion  Madam I'll take my leave  Clar  Why so SirBless me Mr Lionel what's the matterYou turn pale  Lion  Madam  Clar  Pray speak to me Sir You trembleTell me the cause of this sudden changeHow are you Where's your disorder  Lioa  Oh fortune fortune  You ask me in vain  Of what ills I complain  Where harbours the torment I find  In my head in my heart  It invades ev'ry part  And subdues both my body and mind  Each effort I try  Ev'ry med'cine apply  The pangs of my soul to appease  But doom'd to indure  What I mean for a cure  Turns poison and feeds the disease  SCENE IX  CLARISSA DIANA  Dian  My dear ClarissaI'm glad I have found you aloneFor Heaven's sake don't let any one break in upon us and give me leave to sit down with you a little I am in such a tremour such a panic  Clar  Mercy on us what has happened  Dian  You may remember I told you that when I was last winter in London I was followed by an odious fellow one Harman I can't say but the wretch pleased me though he is but a younger brother and not worth sixpence AndIn short when I was leaving town I promised to correspond with him  Clar  Do you think that was prudent  Dian  Madness But this is not the worst for what do you think the creature had the assurance to write to me about three weeks ago desiring permission to come down and spend the summer at my father's  Clar  At your father's  Dian  Ay who never saw him knows nothing of him and would as soon consent to my marrying a horse jockey He told me a long story of some tale he intended to invent to make my father receive him as an indifferent person and some gentlemen in London he said would procure him a letter that should give it a face and he longed to see me so he said he could not live without it and if he could be permited but to spend a week with me  Clar  Well and what answer did you make  Dian  Oh abused him and refused to listen to any such thingButI vow I tremble while I tell it you Just before we left our house the impudent monster arrived there attended by a couple of servants and is now actually coming here with my father  Clar  Upon my word this is a dreadful thing  Dian  Dreadful my dear I happened to be at the window as he came into the court and I declare I had like to have fainted away  Clar  Isn't my Lady below  Dian  Yes and I must run down to her You'll have my brother here presently too he would fain have come in the coach with my mother and me but my father insisted on his walking with him over the fields  Clar  Well Diana with regard to your affair I think you must find some method of immediately informing this gentleman that you consider the outrage he has committed against you in the most heinous light and insist upon his going away directly  Dian  Why I believe that will be the best way but then he'll be begging my pardon and asking to stay  Clar  Why then you must tell him positively you won't consent to it and if he persists in so extravagant a design tell him you'll never see him again as long as you live  Dian  Must I tell him so  Ah prythee spare me dearest creature  How can you prompt me to so much illnature  Kneeling before me  Shou'd I hear him implore me  Cou'd I accuse him  Cou'd I refuse him  The boon he shou'd ask  Set not a lover the cruel task  No believe me my dear  Was he now standing here  In spight of my frights and alarms  I might rate him might scold him  But shou'd still strive to hold him  And sink at last into his arms  SCENE X  CLARISSA  How easy to direct the conduct of others how hard to regulate our own I can give my friend advice while I am conscious of the same indiscretions in myself Yet is it criminal to know the most worthy most amiable man in the world and not be insensible to his merit But my father the kindest best of fathers will he approve the choice I have made Nay has he not made another choice for me And after all how can I be sure that the man I love loves me again He never told me so but his looks his actions his present anxiety sufficiently declare what his delicacy his generosity will not suffer him to utter it is my part then to speak first  Hope and fear alternate rising  Strive for empire o'er my heart  Ev'ry peril now despising  Now at ev'ry breath I start  Teach ye learned sages teach me  How to stem this beating tide  If you've any rules to reach me  Haste and be the weak one's guide  Thus our trial's at a distance  Wisdom science promise aid  But in need of their assistance  We attempt to grasp a shade  SCENE XI  Changes to a Side View of Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE's  House with Gates and a Prospect of the Garden    HARMAN  enters with Colonel  OLDBOY  Col  Well and how does my old friend Dick Rantum do I have not seen him these twelve years he was an honest worthy fellow as ever breathed I remember he kept a girl in London and was cursedly plagued by his wife's relations  Har  Sir Richard was always a man of spirit Colonel  Col  But as to this business of yours which he tells me of in his letterI don't see much in itAn affair with a citizen's daughterpinked her brother in a duelIs the fellow likely to die  Har  Why Sir we hope not but as the matter is dubious and will probably make some noise I thought it was better to be for a little time out of the way when hearing my case Sir Richard Rantum mentioned you he said he was sure you would permit me to remain at your house for a few days and offered me a recommendation  Col  And there's likely to be a brat in the caseAnd the girl's friends are in businessI'll tell you what will be the consequence thenThey will be for going to law with you for a maintenancebut no matter I'll take the affair in hand for youmake me your sollicitor and if you are obliged to pay for a single spoonful of pap I'll be content to father all the children in the Foundling Hospital  Har  You are very kind Sir  Col  But holdhark youyou say there's money to be hadsuppose you were to marry the wench  Har  Do you think Sir that would be so right after what has happened Besides there's a stronger objection To tell you the truth I am honourably in love in another place  Col  Oh you are  Har  Yes Sir but there are obstaclesA father In short Sir the mistress of my heart lives in this very county which makes even my present situation a little irksome  Col  In this county Zounds Then I am sure I am acquainted with her and the first letter of her name is  Har  Excuse me Sir I have some particular reasons  Col  But look who comes yonderHa ha ha My son picking his steps like a dancingmaster Pr'ythee Harman go into the house and let my wife and daughter know we are come while I go and have some sport with him they will introduce you to Sir John Flowerdale  Har  Then Sir I'll take the liberty  Col  But d'ye hear I must have a little more discourse with you about this girl perhaps she's a neighbour of mine and I may be of service to you I suppose she's handsome  Har  It's impossible to describe her to you  Yes she is fair divinely fair  And softer than the balmy air  That vernal Zephir blows  Her cheeks transcend the rose's bloom  And sweeter is the rich perfume  Her ruby lips disclose  Fly swift oh Love and in her ear  Whisper soft her lover's near  Fall of doubt and full of fear  If my rashness should offend  Intercede  My pardon plead  Her angry brow unbend  SCENE XII  Colonel OLDBOY Mr JESSAMY  and several Servants    Col  Why Zounds one would think you had never put your feet to the ground before you make as much work about walking a quarter of a mile as if you had gone a pilgrimage to Jerusalem  Mr Jess  Colonel you have used me extremely ill to drag me through the dirty roads in this manner you told me the way was all over a bowlinggreen only see what a condition I am in  Col  Why how did I know the roads were dirty is that my fault Besides we mistook the way Zounds man your legs will be never the worse when they are brushed a little  Mr Jess  Antoine have you sent La Roque for the shoes and stockings Give me the glass out of your pocketnot a dust of powder left in my hair and the frissure as flat as the foretop of an attorney's clerk get your comb and pomatum you must borrow some powder I suppose there's such a thing as a dressingroom in the house  Col  Ay and a cellar too I hope for I want a glass of wine cursedlybut hold hold Frank where are you going Stay and pay your devoirs here if you please I see there's somebody coming out to welcome us  SCENE XIII  Colonel OLDBOY Mr JESSAMY LIONEL DIANA CLARISSA  Lion  Colonel your most obedient Sir John is walking with my Lady in the garden and has commissioned me to receive you  Col  Mr

severe  None but the brave deserve the fair  ACT II  SCENE I  A Hall in Sir John  FLOWERDALE's  House with the View of a grand Staircase through an Arch On either Side of the Staircase below two Doors leading from different Apartments    LIONEL  enters followed by  JENNY  Jen  Well but Mr Lionel consider pray consider now how can you be so prodigious undiscreet as you are walking about the hall here while the gentlefolks are within in the parlour Don't you think they'll wonder at your getting up so soon after dinner and before any of the rest of the company  Lion  For Heaven's sake Jenny don't speak to me I neither know where I am nor what I am doing I am the most wretched and miserable of all mankind  Jen  Poor dear soul I pity you Yes yes I believe you are miserable enough indeed and I assure you I have pitied you a great while and spoke many a word in your favour when you little thought you had such a friend in a corner  Lion  But good Jenny since by some accident or other you have been able to discover what I would willingly hide from all the world I conjure you as you regard my interest as you value your Lady's peace and honour never let the most distant hint of it escape you for it is a secret of that importance  Jen  And perhaps you think I cant keep a secret Ah Mr Lionel it must be hear see and say nothing in this world or one has no business to live in it besides who would not be in love with my Lady There's never a man this day alive but might be proud of it for she is the handsomest sweetest temperdest And I am sure one of the best mistresses ever poor girl had  Lion  Oh Jenny She's an angel  Jen  And so she is indeedDo you know that she gave me her blue and silver sack to day and it is every crum as good as new and go things as they will don't you be fretting and vexing yourself for I am mortally sartain she would liverer see a toad than this Jessamy Though I must say to my thinking he's a very likely man and a finer pair of eyebrows and a more delicater nose I never saw on a face  Lion  By Heavens I shall run mad  Jen  And why so It is not beauty that always takes the fancy Moreover to let you know if it was I don't think him any more to compare to you than a thistle is to a carnation and so's a sign for mark my words my Lady loves you as much as she hates him  Lion  What you tell me Jenny is a thing I neither merit nor expect No I am unhappy and let me continue so my most presumptuous thoughts shall never carry me to a wish that may affect her quiet or give her cause to repent  Jen  That's very honourable of you I must needs say but for all that liking's liking and one can't help it and if it should be my Lady's case it is no fault of yours I am sure when she called me into her dressingroom before she went down to dinner there she stood with her eyes brim full of tears and so I fell a crying for companyand then she said she could not abice the chap in the parlour and at the same time she bid me take an opportunity to speak to you and desire you to meet her in the garden this evening after tea for she has something to say to you  Lion  Jenny I see you are my friend for which I thank you though I know it is impossible to do me any service take this ring and wear it for my sake  Jen  I am very much obliged to your honour I am your friend indeedbut I say you won't forget to be in the garden now and in the mean time keep as little in the house as you can for walls have eyes and ears and I can tell you the servants take notice of your uneasiness tho' I am always desiring them to mind their own business  Lion  Pray have a care Jenny have a care my dear girl a word may breed suspicion  Jen  Psha have a care yourself it is you that breeds suspicion sighing and pining about you look for all the world like a ghost and if you don't pluck up your spirits you will be a ghost soon letting things get the better of you Though to be sure when I thinks with myself being cross'd in love is a terrible thing There was a young man in the town where I was born made away with himself upon the account of it  Lion  Things shan't get the better of me Jenny  Jen  No more they don't ought And once again I say fortune is thrown in your dish and you are not to fling it out my Lady's estate will be better than three bishopricks if Sir John could give them to you Think of that Mr Lionel think of that  Lion  Think of what  Oh talk not to me of the wealth she possesses  My hopes and my views to herself I confine  The splendour of riches but slightly impresses  A heart that is fraught with a passion like mine  By love only love shou'd our souls be cemented  No int'rest no motive but that wou'd I own  With her in a cottage be blest and contented  And wretched without her tho' plac'd on a throne  SCENE II  JENNY COLONEL OLDBOY  Col  Very well my Lady I'll come again to you presently I am only going into the garden for a mouthful of air Aha my little Abigal Here Molly Jenny Betty What's your name Why don't you answer me hussey when I call you  Jen  If you want any thing Sir I'll call one of the footmen  Col  The footmen the footmen Damn me I never knew one of them in my life that would'nt prefer a rascal to a gentlemanCome here you slut put your hands about my neck and kiss me  Jen  Who I Sir  Col  Ay here's money for you what the devil are you afraid of I'll take you into keeping you shall go and live at one of my tenant's houses  Jen  I wonder you are'nt ashamed Sir to make an honest girl any such proposial you that have a worthy gentlewoman nay a Lady of your ownTo be sure she's a little stricken in years but why should'nt she grow elderly as well as yourself  Col  Burn a Lady I love a pretty girl  Jen  Well then you may go look for one Sir I have no pretensions to the title  Col  Why you pert baggage you don't know me  Jen  What do you pinch my fingers for Yes yes I know you well enough and your charekter's well known all over the country running after poor young creatures as you do to ruinate them  Col  What then people say  Jen  Indeed they talk very bad of you and whatever you may think Sir tho' I'm in a menial station I'm come of people that wou'd'nt see me put upon there are those that wou'd take my part against the proudest he in the land that should offer any thing uncivil  Col  Well come let me know now how does your young Lady like my son  Jen  You want to pump me do you I suppose you would know whether I can keep my tongue within my teeth  Col  She does'nt like him then  Jen  I don't say so SirIsn't this a shame nowI suppose tomorrow or next day it will be reported that Jenny has been talking Jenny said that and t'other But here Sir I ax you Did I tell you any such thing  Col  Why yes you did  Jen  ILord bless me how can you  Col  Ad I'll mouzle you  Jen  Ah ah  Col  What do you bawl for  Jen  Ah ah ah  Indeed forsooth a pretty youth  To play the am'rous fool  At such an age methinks your rage  Might be a little cool  Fie let me go Sir  Kiss meNo no Sir  You pull me and shake me  For what do you take me  This figure to make me  I'd have you to know  I'm not for your game Sir  Nor will I be tame Sir  Lord have you no shame Sir  To tumble one so  SCENE III  Colonel OLDBOY Lady MARY DIANA HARMAN  Lady M  Mr Oldboy won't you give me your hand to lead me up stairs my dearSir I am prodigiously obliged to you I protest I have not been so well I don't know when I have had no return of my bilious complaint after dinner today and eat so voraciously Did you observe Miss the whole wing of a Partridge Doctor Arsnic will be quite astonished when he hears it surely his new invented medicine has done me a prodigious deal of service  Col  Ah you'll always be taking one flop or other till you poison yourself  Lady M  It brought Sir Barnaby Drugg from death's door after having tryed the Spaw and Bristol waters without effect it is good for several things in many sovereign as in colds and consumptions and lowness of spirits it corrects the humours rectifies the juices regulates the nervous system creates an appetite prevents flushings and sickness after meals as also vain fears and headachs it is the finest thing in the world for an asthma and no body that takes it is ever troubled with hysterics  Col  Give me a pinch of your Lordships's snuff  Lady M  This is a mighty pretty sort of man Colonel who is he  Col  A young fellow my Lady recommended to me  Lady M  I protest he has the sweetest taste for poetry He has repeated to me two or three of his own things and I have been telling him of the poem my late brother Lord Jessamy made on the mouse that was drowned  Col  Ay a fine subject for a poem a mouse that was drowned in a  Lady M  Hush my dear Colonel don't mention it to be sure the circumstance was vastly indelicate but for the number of lines the poem was as charming a morselI heard the Earl of P  nley say who understood Latin that it was equal to any thing in Catullus  Col  Well how did you like your son's behaviour at dinner Madam I thought the girl looked a little askew at himWhy he found fault with every thing and contradicted every body  Lady M  SoftlyMiss Flowerdale I understand has desired a private conference with him  Col  What Harman have you got entertaining my daughter there Come hither Dy has he been giving you a history of the accident that brought him down here  Dian  No Papa the gentleman has been telling me  Lady M  No matter what Miss 'tis not polite to repeat what has been said  Col  Well well my Lady you know the compact we made the boy is yours the girl mineGive me your hand Dy  Lady M  Miss why won't you take a pair of my French chickenglovesyour hands look so chapped and so red I declare one would think you did up your own linen  Col  Why now my Lady I think they are very white  Lady M  Colonel I have donePray Sir was there any news when you left London any thing about the EastIndies the ministry or politics of any kind I am strangely fond of politics but I hear nothing since my Lord Jessamy's death he used to write to me all the affairs of the nation for he was a very great politician himself I have a manuscript speech of his in my cabinetHe never spoke it but it is as fine a thing as ever came from man  Col  What is that crawling on your Ladyship's petticoat  Lady M  Where where  Col  Zounds a spider with legs as long as my arm  Lady M  Oh Heavens Ah don't let me look at it I shall faint I shall faint A spider a spider a spider  SCENE IV  COLONEL OLDBOY DIANA HARMAN  Col Old  Hold zounds let her go I knew the spider would set her a galloping with her damned fuss about her brother my Lord Jessamy Harman come hereHow do you like my daughter Is the girl you are in love with as handsome as this  Har  In my opinion Sir  Col  What as handsome as Dy I'll lay you twenty pounds she has not such a pair of eyes He tells me he's in love Dy raging mad for love and by his talk I begin to believe him  Dia  Now for my part papa I doubt it very much though by what I heard the gentleman say just now wi  hin I find he imagines the lady has a violent partiality for him and yet he may be mistaken there too  Col  For shame Dy what the mischief do you mean How can you talk so tartly to a poor young fellow under misfortunes Give him your hand and ask his pardon Don't mind her HarmanFor all this she is as goodnatur'd a little devil as ever was born  Har  You may remember Sir I told you before dinner that I had for some time carried on a private correspondence with my lovely girl and that her father whose consent we despair of obtaining is the great obstacle to our happiness  Col  Why don't you carry her off in spight of him thenI ran away with my wifeask my Lady Mary she'll tell you the thing herselfHer old conceited Lord of a father thought I was not good enough but I mounted a gardenwall notwithstanding their cheveuxdefrize of broken glass bottles took her out of a three pair of stairs window and brought her down a ladder in my armsBy the way she would have squeezed through a cathole to get at meAnd I would have taken her out of the Tower of London damme if it had been surrounded with the three regiments of guards  Dia  But surely papa you would not persuade the gentleman to such a proceeding as this is consider the noise it will make in the country and if you are known to be the adviser and abettor  Col  Why what do I care I say if he takes my advice he'll run away with her and I'll give him all the assistance I can  Har  I am sure Sir you are very kind and to tell you the truth I have more than once had the very scheme in my head if I thought it was feasible and knew how to go about it  Col  Feasible and knew how to go about it The thing's feasible enough if the girl's willing to go off with you and you have spirit sufficient to undertake it  Har  O as for that Sir I can answer  Dia  What Sir that the lady will be willing to go off with you  Har  No Ma'am that I have spirit enough to take her if she is willing to go and thus far I dare venture to promise that between this and tomorrow morning I will find out whether she is or not  Col  So he may she lives but in this county and tell her Harman you have met with a friend who is inclined to serve you You shall have my postchaise at a minute's warning and if a hundred pieces will be of any use to you you may command 'em  Har  And you are really serious Sir  Col  Serious damme if I an't I have put twenty young fellows in a way of getting girls that they never would have thought of and bring her to my house whenever you come you shall have a supper and a bed but you must marry her first because my Lady will be squeamish  Dia  Well but my dear papa upon my word you have a great deal to answer for suppose it was your own case to have a daughter in such circumstances would you be obliged to any one  Col  Hold your tongue hussy who bid you put in your oar However Harman I don't want to set  you upon any thing 'tis no affair of mine to be sure I only give you advice and tell you how I would act if I was in your place  Har  I assure you Sir I am quite charm'd with the advice and since you are ready to stand my friend I am determined to follow it  Col  You are  Har  Positively  Col  Say no more then here's my hand You understand me No occasion to talk any further of it at presentWhen we are alone Dy take Mr Harman into the drawingroom and give him some tea I say Harman Mum  Har  O Sir  Col  What do you mean by your grave looks mistress  How cursedly vext the old fellow will be  When he finds you have snapt up his daughter  But shift as he will leave the matter to me  And I warrant you soon shall have caught her  Whats a plague and a pox  Shall an illnatur'd fox  Prevent youth and beauty  From doing their duty  He ought to be set in the stocks  He merits the law  And if we can't bite him  By gad we'll indite him  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  SCENE V  DIANA HARMAN  Dian  Sir I desire to know what gross acts of imprudence you have ever discovered in me to authorize you in this licence or make you imagine I should not shew such marks of my resentment as your monstrous treatment of me deserves  Har  Nay my dear Diana I confess I have been rather too boldbut consider I languish'd to see you and when an opportunity offer'd to give me that pleasure without running any risque either of your quiet or reputation how hard was it to be resisted 'Tis true I little thought my visit would be attended with such happy consequences as it now seems to promise  Dian  What do you mean  Har  Why don't you see your father has an inclination I should run away with you and is contriving the means himself  Dia  And do you think me capable of concurring Do you think I have no more duty  Har  I don't know that Madam I am sure your refusing to seize such an opportunity to make me happy gives evident proofs that you have very little love  Dia  If there is no way to convince you of my love but by my indiscretion you are welcome to consider it in what light you please  Har  Was ever so unfortunate a dog  Dia  Very pretty this upon my word but is it possible you can be in earnest  Har  It is a matter of too much consequence to jest about  Dia  And you seriously think I ought  Har  You are sensible there are no hopes of your father's cooly and wittingly consenting to our marriage chance has thrown in our way a whimsical method of surprizing him into a compliance and why should not we avail ourselves of it  Dia  And so you would have me  Har  I shall say no more Ma'am  Dia  Nay but for Heaven's sake  Har  No Madam no I have done  Dia  And are you positively in this violent fuss about the matter or only giving yourself airs  Har  You may suppose what you think proper Madam  Dia  Well come let us go into the drawingroom and drink tea and afterwards we'll talk of matters  Har  I won't drink any tea  Dia  Why so  Har  Because I don't like it  Dia  Not like it Ridiculous  Har  I wish you would let me alone  Dia  Nay pr'ythee  Har  I won't  Dia  Well will you if I consent to act as you please  Har  I don't know whether I will or not  Dia  Ha ha ha poor Harman  Come then pining peevish lover  Tell me what to do and say  From your doleful dumps recover  Smile and it shall have its way  With their humours thus to teaze us  Men are sure the strangest elves  Silly creatures would you please us  You should still seem pleas'd yourselves  SCENE VI  HARMAN  Say'st thou so my girl Then Love renounce me if I drive not old Truepenny's humour to the uttermost Let me consider what ill consequence can possibly attend itThe design is his own as in part will be the executionHe may perhaps be angry when he finds out the deceitWell he deceives himself and faults we commit ourselves we seldom find much difficulty in pardoning  Hence with caution hence with fear  Beauty prompts and naught shall stay me  Boldly for that prize I steer  Rocks nor winds nor waves dismay me  Yet rash lover look behind  Think what evils may betide you  Love and fortune both are blind  And you have none else to guide you  SCENE VII  Changes to a handsome Dressingroom supposed to be  CLARISSA's  On one Side between the Wings is a Table with a Glass Boxes and two Chairs  DIANA  enters before  JESSAMY  Dia  Come brother I undertake to be mistress of the ceremony upon this occasion and introduce you to your first audienceMiss Flowerdale is not here I perceive but no matter  Mr Jess  Upon my word a pretty elegant dressingroom this but confound our builders or architects as they call themselves they are all errant stonemasons not one of them know the situation of doors windows or chimnies which are as essential to a room as eyes nose and mouth to a countenance Now if the eyes are where the mouth should be and the nose out of proportion and its place  quel horrible phisiognomie    Dia  My dear brother you are not come here as a virtuoso to admire the temple but as a votary to address the deity to whom it belongs Shew I beseech you a little more devotion and tell me how do you like Miss Flowerdale don't you think her very handsome  Mr Jess  Pale but that I am determinrd she shall remedy for as soon as we are married I will make her put on rouge Let me see has she got any in her boxes here  Veritable toilet a la Angloise  Nothing but a bottle of Hungarywater two or three rows of pins a paper of patches and a little bolearmoniac by way of toothpowder  Dia  Brother I would fain give you some advice upon this occasion which may be of service to you You are now going to entertain a young Lady Let me prevail upon you to lay aside those airs on account of which some people are impertinent enough to call you a coxcomb for I am afraid she may be apt to think you a coxcomb too as I assure you she is very capable of distinguishing  Mr Jess  So much the worse for meIf she is capable of distinguishing I shall meet with a terrible repulse I don't believe she'll have me  Dia  I don't believe she will indeed  Mr Jess  Go on sister ha ha ha  Dia  protest I am seriousThough I perceive you have more faith in the counsellor before you there the lookingglass But give me leave to tell you it is not a powder'd head a lac'd coat a grimace a shrug a bow or a few pert phrases learnt by rote that constitute the power of pleasing all women  Mr Jess  Apres ma chere  Dia  These qualifications we find in our parrots and monkies I would undertake to teach Poll in three weeks the fashionable jargon of half the fine men about town and I am sure it must be allowed that pug in a scarlet coat is a figure as degagé and alluring as most of them  Mr Jess  Upon my honour that's a charming India cabinetBut Miss Flowerdale will be here presently You had better return to give the gentleman his tea and it is ten to one but we shall agree though I should not profit by your sage advice  Dia  Well I will leave you  I wonder I swear  How women can bear  A fop that himself still admires  Mere puppets for play  Of papier maché  Without either soul or desires  One's pos'd in one's aim  To give them a name  Things of such equivocal growth  Nor master nor miss  But 'twixt that and this  Ridiculous copies of both  Exit  SCENE VIII  CLARISSA  Mr  JESSAMY  Clar  Sir I took the liberty to desire a few moments private conversation with youI hope you will excuse itI am really greatly embarrass'd But in an affair of such immediate consequence to us both  Mr Jess  My dear creature don't be embarass'd before me I should be extremely sorry to strike you with any awe but this is a species of mauvaise honte which the company I shall introduce you to will soon cure you of  Clar  Upon my word Sir I don't understand you  Mr Jess  Perhaps you may be under some uneasiness lest I should not be quite so warm in the prosecution of this affair as you could wish it is true with regard to quality I might do better and with regard to fortune full as wellBut you please me Upon my soul I have not met with any thing more agreeable to me a great while  Clar  Pray Sir keep your seat  Mr Jess  Mauvaise honte again My dear there is nothing in these little familiarities between you and meWhen we are married I shall do every thing to render your life happy  Clar  Ah Sir pardon me The happiness of my life depends upon a circumstance  Mr Jess  OhI understand youYou have been told I suppose of the Italian opera girlRat peoples tonguesHowever 'tis true I had an affair with her at Naples and she is now here But be satisfied I'll give her a thousand pounds and send her about her business  Clar  Me Sir I protest nobody told meLord I never heard any such thing or enquired about it  Mr Jess  Nor have not they been chattering to you of my affair at Pisa with the Principessa del  Clar  No indeed Sir  Mr Jess  Well I was afraid they might because in this rude countryHowever my dear creature you ought to prepare yourself against any little trials of this kind we are naturally volage yet I dare venture to promise you that my flights will be but short and I shall soon return again to my destined mate But why silent on a suddendon't be afraid to speak  Clar  No Sir I will come to the subject on which I took the liberty to trouble youIndeed I have great reliance on your generosity  Mr Jess  You'll find me generous as a prince depend on't  Clar  I am bless'd Sir with one of the best of fathers I never yet disobey'd him in which I have had little merit for his commands have always been to secure my own felicity  Mr Jess  Well my dear don't imagine I will prevent your being dutiful to your father no no continue to love him I shan't be jealous  Clar  But now Sir I am under the shocking necessity of disobeying him or being wretched for ever  Mr Jess  Hem  Clar  I repeat it Sir wretched for evermy present situationthe gloomy prospect before methe inquietude of my mind  Ah how weak is inclination  Fain I would yet more explain  But you see my agitation  And will spare my tongue the pain  Help and force at once forsake me  On your kindness I depend  Since your wife you cannot make me  Make O make me Sir your friend  SCENE IX  JESSAMY JENKINS  Mr Jess  Who's there  Jenk  Do you call Sir  Mr Jess  Hark you old gentleman who are you  Jenk  Sir my name is Jenkins  Mr Jess  Oh you are Sir John Flowerdale's steward a servant he puts confidence in  Jenk  Sir I have served Sir John Flowerdale many years he is the best of masters and I believe he has some dependance on my attachment and fidelity  Mr Jess  Then Mr Jenkins I shall condescend to speak to you Does your master know who I am Does he know Sir that I am likely to be a Peer of Great Britain That I have ten thousand pounds a year that I have passed through all Europe with distinguished eclat that I refused the daughter of Mynheer Van Slokenfolk the great Dutch burgomaster and that if I had not had the misfortune of being bred a protestant I might have married the niece of his present holiness the Pope with a fortune of two hundred thousand piastres  Jenk  I am sure Sir my master has all the respect imaginable  Mr Jess  Then Sir how comes he after my shewing an inclination to be allied to his family how comes he I say to bring me to his house to be affronted I have let his daughter go but I think I was in the wrong for a woman that insults me is no more safe than a man I have brought a Lady to reason before now for giving me saucy language and left her male friends to revenge it  Jenk  Pray good Sir what is the matter  Mr Jess  Why Sir this is the matter SirYour master's daughter Sir has behaved to me with damn'd insolence and impertinence and you may tell Sir John Flowerdale first with regard to her  that I think she is a silly ignorant aukward ill bred country puss  Jenk  Oh Sir for Heaven's sake  Mr Jess  And that with regard to himself he is in my opinion an old doating ridiculous country 'squire without the knowledge of either men or things and that he is below my notice if it were not to despise him  Jenk  Good lord Good lord  Mr Jess  And advise him and his daughter to keep out of my way for by gad I will affront them in the first place I meet themAnd if your master is for carrying things further tell him I fence better than any man in Europe  In Italy Germany France I have been  Where princes I've liv'd with where monarchs I've seen  The great have caress'd me  The fair have address'd me  Nay smiles I have had from a queen  And now shall a pert  Insignificant flirt  With insolence use me  Presume to refuse me  She fancy's my pride will be hurt  But tout au contraire  I'm pleas'd I declare  Quite happy to think I escape from the snare  Serviteur Mam'selle my claim I withdraw  Hey where are my people fal lal lal lal la  SCENE X  JENKINS  I must go and inform Sir John of what has happened but I will not tell him of the outrageous behaviour of this young spark for he is a man of spirit and would resent it Egad my own fingers itched to be at him once or twice and as stout as he is I fancy these old fists would give him a bellyful He complains of Miss Clarissa but she is incapable of treating him in the manner he says Perhaps she may have behaved with some coldness towards him and yet that is a mystery to me too for she has seen him before and I have heard Sir John say a thousand times that she expressed no repugnance to the match  Oh ladies lovely creatures  Your wit your shape your features  Are all divine  But still changing feigning  The man who seeks your meaning  Goes out the sea to fathom  Without lead or line  Your charms are form'd to please us  You spread the lure to seize us  And when we get  Into the net  Why then you vex and teaze us  SCENE XI  Changes to Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE's  Garden with a view of a Canal by Moonlight the side Scenes represent Boxhedges intermixed with Statues and flowering Shrubs  LIONEL  enters leading  CLARISSA  Lion  Histmethought I heard a noiseshould we be surprized together at a juncture so critical what might be the consequenceI know not how it is but at this the happiest moment of my life I feel a damp a tremor at my heart  Clar  Then what should I do If you tremble I ought to be terrified indeed who have discovered sentiments which perhaps I should have hid with a frankness that by a man less generous less noble minded than yourself might be construed to my disadvantage  Lion  Oh wound me not with so cruel an expressionyou love me and have condescended to confess itYou have seen my torments and been kind enough to pity themThe world indeed may blame you  Clar  And yet was it proclaimed to the world What could the most malicious suggest They could but say that truth and sincerity got the better of forms that the tongue dar'd to speak the honest sensations of the mind that while you aimed at improving my understanding you engaged and conquered my heart  Lion  And is it is it possible  Clar  Be calm and listen to me what I have done has not been lightly imagined nor rashly undertaken it is the work of reflection of conviction my love is not a sacrifice to my own fancy but a tribute to your worth did I think there was a more deserving man in the world  Lion  If to doat on you more than life be to deserve you so far I have merit if to have no wish no  hope no thought but you can entitle me to the envied distinction of a moment's regard so far I dare pretend  Clar  That I have this day refused a man with whom I could not be happy I make no merit born for quiet and simplicity the crouds of the world the noise attending pomp and distinction have no charms for me I wish to pass my life in rational tranquility with a friend whose virtues I can respect whose talents I can admire who will make my esteem the basis of my affection  Lion  O charming creature yes let me indulge the flattering idea form'd with the same sentiments the same feelings the same tender passion for each other Nature design'd us to compose that sacred union which nothing but death can annul  Clar  One only thing remember Secure in each others affections here we must rest I would not give my father a moment's pain to purchase the empire of the world That he will never force my inclinations I am confident and while he lives or till some favourable accident now unforeseen offers to befriend us  Lion  Command dispose of me as you please angels take cognizance of the vows of innocence and virtue and I will believe that ours are already register'd in Heaven  Clar  I will believe so too  Go and on my truth relying  Comfort to your cares applying  Bid each doubt and sorrow flying  Leave to peace and love your breast  Go and may the Pow'rs that hear us  Still as kind protectors near us  Through our troubles safely steer us  To a port of joy and rest  SCENE XII  LIONEL SIR JOHN FLOWERDALE  Sir John  Lionel Lionel  Lion  Who calls  Sir John  Lionel  Lion  Heavens 'Tis Sir John Flowerdale where shall I hide myself how avoid himthis way unlucky O cruel love to what do you reduce me  Sir John  Who's there  Lion  'Tis I Sir I am here Lionel  Sir John  My dear lad I have been searching for you this half hour and was at last told you had come into the garden I have a piece of news which I dare swear will shock and surprize you my daughter has refused Colonel Oldboy's son who is this minute departed the house in violent resentment of her ill treatment  Lion  Is he gone Sir  Sir John  Yes and the family are preparing to follow him it is impossible to describe to you how I am grieved at this fatal accident you know as well as I the cogent reasons that determined me to this marriage Oh Lionel Clarissa has deceived me in this affair she has suffered me to deceive myself The measures which I have been so long preparing are broken in a momentmy hopes frustrated and both parties in the eye of the world rendered light and ridiculous  Lion  I am sorry to see you so much moved pray Sir recover yourself  Sir John  I am sorry Lionel she has profited no better by your lessons of philosophy than to impose upon and distress so kind a father  Lion  Have juster thoughts of her Sir She has not imposed on you she is incapablehave but a little patience and things may yet be brought about  Sir John  No Lionel no the matter is past and there's an end of it yet I would conjecture to what such an unexpected turn in her conduct can be owing I would fain be satisfied of the motive that could urge her to so extraordinary a proceeding without the least intimation the least warning to me or any of her friends  Lion  Perhaps Sir the gentleman may have been too impetuous and offended Miss Flowerdale's delicacy certainly nothing else could occasion  Sir John  Heaven only knowsI think indeed there can be no settled aversion and surely her affections are not engaged elsewhere  Lion  Engag'd SirNo Sir  Sir John  I think not Lionel  Lion  You may be positive SirI'm sure  Sir John  O worthy young man whose integrity openness and every good quality have rendered dear to me as my own child I see this affair troubles you as much as it does me  Lion  It troubles me indeed Sir  Sir John  However my particular disappointment ought not to be detrimental to you nor shall it I well know how irksome it is to a generous mind to live in a state of dependence and have long had it in my thoughts to make you easy for life  Lion  Sir John the situation of my mind at present is a little disturb'dspare meI beseech you spare me why will you persist in a goodness that makes me asham'd of myself  Sir John  There is an estate in this county which I purchased some years ago by me it will never be missed and whoever marries my daughter will have little reason to complain of my disposing of such a trifle for my own gratification On the present marriage I intended to perfect a deed of gift in your favour which has been for some time prepared my lawyer has this day completed it and it is yours my dear Lionel with every good wish that the warmest friend can bestow  Lion  Sir if you presented a pistol with design to shoot me I would submit to it but you must excuse me I cannot lay myself under more obligations  Sir John  Your delicacy carries you too far in this I confer a favour on myself however we'll talk no more on the subject at present let us walk towards the house our friends will depart else without my bidding them adieu  SCENE XIII  DIANA CLARISSA  and afterwards  LIONEL  Dian  So then my dear Clarissa you really give credit to the ravings of that French wretch with regard to a plurality of worlds  Clar  I don't make it an absolute article of belief but I think it an ingenious conjecture with great probability on its side  Dian  And we are a moon to the moon Nay child I know something of astronomy but thatthat little shining thing there which seems not much larger than a silver plate should perhaps contain great cities like London and who can tell but they may have kings there and parliaments and plays and operas and people of fashion Lord the people of fashion in the moon must be strange creatures  Clar  Methinks Venus shines very bright in yonder corner  Dian  Venus O pray let me look at Venus I suppose if there are any inhabitants there they must be all lovers  Lion  Was ever such a wretchI can't stay a moment in a place where is my reposefled with my virtue Was I then born for falshood and dissimulation I was I was and live to be conscious of it to impose upon my friend to betray my benefactor and lie to hide my ingratitudea monster in a momentNo I may be the most unfortunate of men but I will not be the most odious while my heart is yet capable of dictating what is honest I will obey its voice  SCENE XIV  DIANA CLARISSA LIONEL Colonel OLDBOY HARMAN  Col  Dy where are you What the mischief is this a time to be walking in the garden The coach has been ready this half hour and your mama is waiting for you  Dian  I am learning astronomy Sir do you know papa that the moon is inhabited  Col  Hussy you are half a lunatic yourself come here things have gone just as I imagin'd they wou'd the girl has refus'd your brother I knew he must disgust her  Dian  Women will want taste now and then Sir  Col  But I must talk to the young Lady a little  Har  Well I have had a long conference with your father about the elopement and he continues firm in his opinion that I ought to attempt it in short all the necessary operations are settled between us and I am to leave his house tomorrow morning if I can but persuade the young Lady  Dian  Ay but I hope the young Lady will have more senseLord how can you teaze me with your nonsense Come Sir isn't it time for us to go in Her Ladyship will be impatient  Col  Friend Lionel good night to you Miss Clarissa my dear tho' I am father of the puppy who has displeased you give me a kiss you serv'd him right and I thank you for it  Col  O what a night is here for love  Cynthia brightly shining above  Among the trees  To the sighing breeze  Fountains tinkling  Stars a twinkling  Dian  O what a night is here for love  So may the morn propitious prove  Har  And so it will if right I guess  For sometimes light  As well as night  A lover's hopes may bless  A  Farewell my friend  May gentle rest  Calm each tumult in your breast  Every pain and fear remove  Lion  What have I done  Where shall I run  With grief and shame at once opprest  How my own upbraiding shun  Or meet my friend distrest  A  Hark to Philomel how sweet  From yonder elm  Col  Tweet tweet tweet tweet  A  O  what a night is here for love  But vainly Nature strives to move  Nor nightingales among the trees  Nor twinkling stars nor sighing breeze  Nor murm'ring streams  Nor Phoebe's beams  Can charm unless the heart's at ease  ACT III  SCENE I  A Room in Colonel  OLDBOY's  House  HARMAN  enters with his Hat Boots and Whip followed by  DIANA  Dian  Pry'thee hear me  Har  My dear what would you say  Dian  I am afraid of the step we are going to take indeed I am 'tis true my father is the contriver of it but really on consideration I think I should appear less culpable if he was not so I am at once criminal myself and rendering him ridiculous  Har  Do you love me  Dian  Suppose I do you give me a very ill proof of your love for me when you would take advantage of my tenderness to blind my reason how can you have so little regard for my honour as to sacrifice it to a vain triumph For it is in that light I see the rash action you are forcing me to commit nay methinks my consenting to it should injure me in your own esteem When a woman forgets what she owes herself a lover should set little value upon any thing she gives to him  Har  Can you suppose then can you imagine that my passion will ever make me forget the veneration And an elopement is nothing when it is on the road to matrimony  Dian  At best I shall incur the censure of disobedience and indiscretion and is it nothing to a young woman what the world says of her Ah my good friend be assured such a disregard of the world is the first step towards deserving its reproaches  Har  But the necessity we are underMankind has too much good sense too much good nature  Dian  Every one has good sense enough to see other people's faults and good nature enough to  overlook their own Besides the most sacred things may be made an ill use of and even marriage itself if indecently and improperly  Har  Come get yourself ready where is your bandbox hat and cloak Slip into the garden be there at the irongate which you shewed me just now and as the postchaise comes round I will step and take you in  Dian  Yet one thing more My fortune depends almost entirely upon my father's generosity now think with yourself whether it would not be better to devise some other method  Har  Hang fortune It is the bane of love and therefore they are both pictur'd blind to shew that their coming together can never be premeditated but if they do meet it is by chance when they jostle and one generally overturns t'other  Dian  Dear Harman let me beg of you to desist  Har  Dear Diana let me beg of you to go on  Dian  I shall never have resolution to carry me thro' it  Har  We shall have four horses my dear and they will assist us  Dian  In shortI cannot go with you  Har  But before meInto the garden won't you  Dian  Well Harman if ever hereafter you presume to reproach me with this instance of my condescension  Ah how cruel the reflection  Woman once to error led  Ev'ry eye wakes for detection  Ev'ry tongue the tale to spread  Vainly is her fault lamented  By the poor misguided fair  That whith caution had prevented  Penitence can ne'er repair  SCENE II  Colonel  OLDBOY HARMAN  Col  Hey dey what's the meaning of this Who is it went out of the room there Have you and my daughter been in conference Mr Harman Dy and you in private eh  Har  Yes faith Sir she has been taking me to task here very severely with regard to this affair and she has said so much against it and put it into such a strange light that she has almost stagger'd my resolution  Col  A busy impertinent baggage egad I wish I had catched her meddling and after I had ordered her not but the thing's gone too far now to retract you say you have sent to the girl and she has return'd for answer that she is ready to go with you you must not disappoint the poor thing nor you shan't  Har  No no Colonel I am determined I always have politeness enough to hear a lady's reasons but constancy enough to keep a will of my own  Col  Very wellnow let me ask you don't you think it would be proper upon this occasion to have a letter ready writ for the father to let him know who has got his daughter where you have taken her and how you design to dispose of her  Har  Certainly Sir and I'll write it directly  Col  You write it you be damn'd I wo'nt trust you with it I tell you Harman you'll commit some cursed blunder if you don't leave the management of this whole affair to me I have writ the letter for you myself  Har  Have you Sir  Col  Ayhere read it I think its the thing however you are welcome to make any alteration you like  Har  "Sir I have loved your daughter a great while secretly she assures me there is no hopes of your consenting to our marriage I therefore take her without it I am a gentleman who will use her well  and when you consider the matter I dare swear you will be willing to give her a fortune If not you shall find I dare behave myself like a manA word to the wiseYou must expect to hear from me in another stile"  Col  Now Sir I will tell you what you must do with this letter as soon as you have got off with the girl Sir send your servant back to leave it at the house with orders to have it deliver'd to the old gentleman  Har  Upon my honour I will Colonel  Col  But upon my honour I don't believe you'll get the girl come Harman I'll bet you a buck and six dozen of burgundy that you won't have spirit enough to bring this affair to a crisis  Har  And I say done first Colonel  Col  Then look into the court there Sir a chaise with four of the prettiest bay geldings in England with two boys in scarlet and silver jackets that will whisk you along  Har  Boys Colonel Little cupids to transport me to the summit of my desires  Col  Ay but for all that it mayn't be amiss for me to talk to them a little out of the window for you Dick come hither you are to go with this gentleman and do whatever he bids you and take into the chaise whoever he pleases and drive like devils do you hear but be kind to the dumb beasts  Har  Leave that to me SirAnd so my dear Colonel  To fear a stranger  Behold the soldier arm  He knows no danger  When honour sounds the alarm  But dauntless goes  Among his foes  In Cupid's militia  So fearless I issue  And as you see  Arm'd capapee  Resolve on death or victory  SCENE III  Colonel OLDBOY Lady MARY  and then  JENNY  Lady M  Mr Oldboy here is a note from Sir John Flowerdale it is address'd to me intreating my son to come over there again this morning He apprehends the accident yesterday arose from some mistake and I really believe it did for certainly the young Lady could not be so wanting to her own interest as premeditatedly to refuse my son  Col  What the devil young Lady would do otherwise  Lady M  The note is brought by a maid she is in the antichamberWe had better speak to herChild child why don't you come in  Jen  I chuse to stay where I am if your Ladyship pleases  Lady M  Stay where you are are why so  Jen  I am afraid of the old gentleman there  Col  Afraid of me hussy  Lady M  Pray Colonel have patienceAfraid Here is something at the bottom of thisWhat did you mean by that expression child  Jen  Why the Colonel knows very well Madam he wanted to be rude with me yesterday  Lady M  Oh Mr Oldboy  Col  Lady Mary don't provoke me but let me talk to the girl about her business How come you to bring this note here  Jenny  Why Sir John gave it to me to deliver to my uncle Jenkins and I took it down to his house but while we were talking together he remembered that he had some business with Sir John so he desired me to bring it because he said it was not proper to be sent by any of the common servants  Lady M  Colonel look in my face and help blushing if you can  Col  What the plague's the matter my Lady I have not been wronging you now as you call it  Jenny  Indeed Madam he offer'd to make me his kept Madam I am sure his usage of me put me into such a twitter that I did not know what I was doing all the day after  Lady M  I don't doubt it tho' I so lately forgave him but as the poet says his sex is all deceit Read Pamela child and resist temptation  Jenny  Yes Madam I will  Col  Why I tell you my Lady it was all a joke  Jenny  No Sir it was no joke you made me a proffer of money so you did whereby I told you you had a lady of your own and that though she was old you had no right to despise her  Lady M  And how dare you mistress make use of my name Is it for such trollops as you to talk of persons of distinction behind their backs  Jenny  Why madam I only said you was in years  Lady M  Sir John Flowerdale shall be inform'd of your impertinence and you shall be turn'd out of the family I see you are a confident creature and I believe you are no better than you should be  Jenny  I scorn your words Madam  Lady M  Get out of the room how dare you stay in this room to talk impudently to me  Jenny  Very well Madam I shall let my lady know how you have us'd me but I shan't be turn'd out of my place Madam nor at a loss if I am and if you are angry with every one that won't say you are young I believe there is very few you will keep friends with  I wonder I'm sure why this fuss should be made  For my part I'm neither asham'd nor afraid  Of what I have done nor of what I have said  A servant I hope is no slave  And tho' to their shames  Some ladies call names  I know better how to behave  Times are not so bad  If occasion I had  Nor my character such I need starve on't  And for going away  I don't want to stay  And so I'm your Ladyship's servant  SCENE IV  Colonel OLDBOY Lady MARY Mr JESSAMY  Mr Jess  What is the matter here  Lady M  I will have a separate maintenance I will indeed Only a new instance of your father's infidelity my dear Then with such low wretches farmers daughters and servant wenches but any thing with a cap on 'tis all the same to him  Mr Jess  Upon my word Sir I am sorry to tell you that those practices very ill suit the character which you ought to endeavour to support in the world  Lady M  Is this a recompence for my love and regard I who have been tender and faithful as a turtle dove  Mr Jess  A man of your birth and distinction should methinks have views of a higher nature than such low such vulgar libertinism  Lady M  Consider my birth and family too Lady Mary Jessamy might have had the best matches in England  Mr Jess  Then Sir your grey hairs  Lady M  I that have brought you so many lovely sweet babes  Mr Jess  Nay Sir it is a reflection on me  Lady M  The heinous sin too  Mr Jess  Indeed Sir I blush for you  Col  S'death and fire you little effeminate puppy do you know who you talk toAnd you Madam do you know who I amGet up to your chamber or zounds I'll make such a  Lady M  Ah my dear come away from him  Colonel OLDBOY Mr JESSAMY a SERVANT  Col  Am I to be tutor'd and call'd to an account How now you scoundrel what do you want  Serv  A letter Sir  Col  A letter from whom sirrah  Serv  The gentleman's servant an't please your honour that left this just now in the postchaisethe gentleman my young lady went away with  Col  Your young lady sirrahYour young lady went away with no gentleman you dogWhat gentleman What young lady sirrah  Mr Jess  There is some mystery in thisWith your leave Sir I'll open the letter I believe it contains no secrets  Col  What are you going to do you jackanapes you shan't open a letter of mineDyDianaSomebody call my daughter to me there  "To William Oldboy EsqSir I have lov'd your daughter a great while secretlyConsenting to our marriage"  Mr Jess  So so  Col  You villainyou dog what is it you have brought me here  Serv  Please your honour if you'll have patience I'll tell your honourAs I told your honour before the gentleman's servant that went off just now in the postchaise come to the gate and left it after his master was gone I saw my young lady go into the chaise with the gentleman  Mr Jess  A very fine joke indeed pray Colonel do you generally write letters to yourself why this is your own hand  Col  Call all the servants in the house let horses be saddled directlyevery one take a different road  Serv  Why your honour Dick said it was by your own orders  Col  My orders you rascal I thought he was going to run away with another gentleman's daughter DyDiana Oldboy  Mr Jess  Don't waste your lungs to no purpose Sir your daughter is half a dozen miles off by this time  Col  Sirrah you have been brib'd to further the scheme of a pickpocket here  Mr Jess  Besides the matter is entirely of your own contriving as well as the letter and spirit of this elegant epistle  Col  You are a coxcomb and I'll disinherit you the letter is none of my writing it was writ by the devil and the devil contrived it Diana Margaret my Lady Mary William John  Mr Jess  I am very glad of this prodigiously glad of it upon my honour but what shall I do with myself I can't think of staying here any longerrot the countryI wish I had never returned to it with their vulgar trade and liberty  Bear oh bear me of a sudden  Some kind stroke of smiling chance  From this land of beef and pudding  To dear Italy or France  I'm sick to the soul  Politicks and seacoal  Have given me the vapours  Their cursed newspapers  Their mobbing  Stockjobbing  Are horrors to me  I wish the whole island was sunk in the sea  SCENE VI  COLONEL OLDBOY  with one Boot on his Whip his Cap and a riding Coat on his arm followed by a number of servants  A slut a jade and he a rascal a poaching rascal but damn me I won't follow her No no take my whip and my cap and my coat and come here you Sir and pull off my boot ay ay let her cr  me be her punishment I won't follow her the length of a spur leather but I will be revenged on her she shall never have sixpence from me the disappointment will put the scoundrel out of temper and he'll thrash her a dozen times a dayThe thought pleases me I hope he will do soZounds who would ever have dependance on any thing female she that seemed so well contented in my house and in the very moment when I was best contented with her and contriving to make her fortuneBut why should I vex myself I am no worse off than every father may be if an opportunity offers  Girls like sqirrels oft appear  In their cages pleased with slav'ry  But in fact 'tis all but knav'ry  Less thro' love than out of fear  Only on their tricks relying  Let them out their bonds untying  And you'll see the matter plain  Once there's nought their flight to hamper  Prestowhiskaway they scamper  Never to return again  Wou'd you manage lasses rightly  You must watch them daily nightly  Shut them close and hold them tightly  Never loose an inch of chain  Freedom runaways will make 'em  And the devil can't o'ertake e'm  SCENE VII  Changes to  CLARISSA's  Dressingroom on the table is a cushion with babins for making lace and near it a small frame for embroidery with chairs  CLARISSA  enters followed by  JENNY  Clar  Jenny set my work here  Jen  Yes Ma'am and my own too I'm sure I have been very idle this week and I am in no very good working humour at present  Clar  Where have you been I was enquiring for youwhy will you go out without letting me know  Jen  Dear Ma'am never any thing happen'd so unlucky I am sorry you wanted meBut I was sent to Colonel Oldboy's with a letter where I have been so usedLord have mercy upon mequality indeed I say qualitypray Madam do you think that I looks any ways like an immodest parsonto be sure I have a gay air and I can't help it and I loves to appear a little genteelish that's what I do  Clar  Jenny take away this thing I can't work  Jen  Heaven preserve me Madam you are crying  Clar  O my dear Jenny  Jen  My dear mistress what's the matter  Clar  I am undone  Jen  No Madam no Lord forbid  Clar  I am indeedI have been rash enough to discover my weakness for a man who treats me with contempt  Jen  Is Mr Lionel ungrateful then  Clar  I have lost his esteem for ever Jenny since last night that I fatally confess'd what I should have kept a secret from all the world he has scarce condescended to cast a look at me nor given me an answer when I spoke to him but with coldness and reserve  Jen  Then he is a nasty barbarous unhuman brute  Clar  Hold Jenny hold it is all my fault  Jen  Your fault Madam I wish I was to hear such a word come out of his mouth if he was a minister tomorrow and to say such a thing from his pulpit and I by I'd tell him it was false upon the spot  Clar  Somebody's at the door see who it is  Jen  You in fault indeedthat I know to be the most virtuousest nicest most delicatest  Clar  How now  Jen  Madam its a message from Mr Lionel if you are alone and at leisure he would be glad to wait upon you I'll tell him Madam that you're busy  Clar  Where is he Jenny  Jen  In the study the man says  Clar  Then go to him and tell him I should be glad to see him but do not bring him up immediately because I will stand in the balcony a few minutes for a little air  Jen  Do so dear Madam for your eyes are as red as ferrets you are ready to faint too mercy on us for what do you grieve and vex yourselfif I was as you  Clar  Oh  Why with sighs my heart is swelling  Why with tears my eyes o'er flow  Ask me not 'tis past the telling  Mute involuntary woe  Who to winds and waves a stranger  Ventrous tempts the inconstant seas  In each billow fancy's danger  Shrinks at every rising breeze  SCENE VIII  Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE JENKINS  Sir Jo  So then the mystery is discoveredbut is it possible that m  daughter's refusal of Colonel's Oldboy's son should proceed from a clandestine engagement and that engagement with Lionel  Jenk  My niece Sir is in her young Lady's secrets and Lord knows she had little design to betray them but having remarked some odd expressions of hers yesterday when sh  came down to me this morning with the letter I questioned her and in short drew the whole affair out upon which I feigned a recollection of some business with you and desired her to carry the letter to Colonel Oldboy's herself while I came up hither  Sir Jo  And they are mutually promised to each other and that promise was exchanged yesterday  Jenk  Yes Sir and it is my duty to tell you else I would rather die then be the means of wounding the heart of my dear young lady for if there is one upon earth of truly noble and delicate sentiments  Sir Jo  I thought so once Jenkins  Sir Jo  And think so still O good Sir John now is the time for you to e  e  t that character of worth and gentleness which the world so deservedly has given you you have indeed c  use to be offended but consider Sir your daughter is young beautiful and amiable the poor youth unexperienced sensible and at a time of life when such temptations are hard to be resisted their opp  tu  i  s were many their cast of thinking the same  Sir  Jenkins I can allow for all these things but th  ng hypocrites there's the thing Jenkins their h  ocrisy their hypocrisy wounds me  Jen  Call it by a gentler name Sir modesty on her part apprehension on his  Sir Jo  Then what opportunity have they had they never were together but when my sister or myself made  one of the company besides I had so firm a reliance on Lionel's honour and gratitude  Jenk  Sir I can never think that nature stamp'd that gracious countenance of his to mask a corrupt heart  Sir Jo  How at the very time that he was conscious of being himself the cause of it did he not shew more concern at this affair than I did Nay don't I tell you that last night of his own accord he offered to be a mediator in the affair desired my leave to speak to my daughter I thought myself obliged to him consented and in consequence of his assurance of success wrote that letter to Colonel Oldboy to desire the family would come here again today  Jenk  Sir as we were standing in the next room I heard a message delivered from Mr Lionel desiring leave to wait upon your daughter I dare swear they will be here presently suppose we were to step into that closet and overhear their conversation  Sir Jo  What Jenkins after having lived so many years in confidence with my child shall I become an evesdropper to detect her  Jenk  It is necessary at presentCome in my dear master let us only consider that we were once young like them subject to the same passions the same indiscretions and it is the duty of every man to pardon errors incident to his kind  When love gets into a youthful brain  Instruction is fruitless and caution vain  Prudence may cry do so  But if love says no  Poor Prudence may go  With her preaching  And teaching  To Jericho  Dear Sir in old age  'Tis not hard to be sage  And 'tis easy to point the way  But do or say  What we may  Love and youth will have their day  SCENE IX  CLARISSA  and then  LIONEL  Clar  He comes O Heavens in this trying instant vouchsafe your aid A mist seems to gather round me and I am ready to sink under I know not what oppression  Sir you desired to speak to me I need not tell you the present situation of my heart it is full Whatever you have to say I beg you will explain yourself and if possible rid me of the anxiety under which I have laboured for some hours  Lion  Madam your anxiety cannot be greater than mine I come indeed to speak to you and yet I know not how I come to advise you shall I say as a friend yes as a friend to your glory your felicity dearer to me than my life  Clar  Go on Sir  Lion  Sir John Flowerdale Madam is such a father as few are blessed with his care his prudence has provided for you a matchYour refusal renders him inconsolable Listen to no suggestions that would pervert you from your duty but make the worthiest of men happy by submitting to his will  Clar  How Sir after what passed between us yesterday evening can you advise me to marry Mr Jessamy  Lion  I would advise you to marry any one Madam rather than a villain  Cla  A villain Sir  Lion  I should be the worst of villains Madam was I to talk to you in any other strain Nay am I not a villain at once treacherous and ungrateful Received into this house as an asylum what have I done Betrayed the confidence of the friend that trusted me endeavoured to sacrifice his peace and the honour of his family to my own unwarrantable desires  Clar  Say no more Sir say no more I see my error too late I have parted from the rules prescribed to my sex I have mistaken indecorum for a laudable  sincerity and it is just I should meet with the treatment my imprudence deserves  Lion  'Tis I and only I am to blame while I took advantage of the father's security I practised upon the tenderness and ingenuity of the daughter my own imagination gone astray I artfully laboured to lead yours after it but here Madam I give you back those vows which I insidiously extorted from you keep them for some happier man who may receive them without wounding his honour or his peace  lar  For Heaven's sake  Lion  Why do you weep  Clar  Don't speak to me  Lion  Oh my Clarissa my heart is broke I am hateful to myself for loving youyet before I leave you for ever I will once more touch that lovely hand Indulge my fondness with a last lookpray for your health and prosperity  Clar  Can you forsake me Have I then given my affections to a man who rejects and disregards them Let me throw myself at my father's feet he is generous and compassionateHe knows your worth  Lion  Mention it not were you stript of fortune reduced to the meanest station and I monarch of the globe I should glory in raising you to universal empire but as it is  Lion  O dry those tears like melted ore  Fast dropping on my heart they fall  Think think no more of me no more  The mem'ry of past scenes recall  On a wild sea of passion toss'd  I split upon the fatal shelf  Friendship and love at once are lost  And now I wish to lose myself  SCENE X  CLARISSA JENNY  then Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE  and  JENKINS  and afterwards  LIONEL  Jenny  O Madam I have betray'd you I have gone and said something I should not have said to my uncle Jenkins and as sure as day he has gone and told it all to Sir John  Clar  My father  Sir John  Go Jenkins and desire that young gentleman to come backstay where you arebut what have I done to you my child How have I deserv'd that you should treat me like an enemy Has there been any undesigned rigour in my conduct or terror in my looks  Clar  Oh Sir  Jenk  Here is Mr Lionel  Sir John  Come inWhen I tell you that I am instructed in all your proceedings and that I have been ear witness to your conversation in this place you will perhaps imagine what my thoughts are of you and the measures which justice prescribes me to follow  Lion  Sir I have nothing to say in my own defence I stand before you selfconvicted selfcondemn'd and shall submit without murmuring to the sentence of my judge  Sir John  As for you Clarissa since your earliest infancy you have known no parent but me I have been to you at once both father and mother and that I might the better fulfill those united duties tho'

repaid my affection with dissimulationClarissa you should have trusted me  Jenny  O my dear sweet Lady  Sir John  As for you Mr Lionel what terms can I find strong enough to paint the excess of my friendship  I loved I esteemed I honoured your father he was a brave a generous and a sincere man I thought you inherited his good qualitiesyou were left an orphan I adopted you put you upon the footing of my own son educated you like a gentleman and design'd you for a profession to which I thought your virtues would have been an ornament  Jenny  Dear me dear me  Jenk  Hold your tongue  Sir John  What return you have made me you seem to be acquainted with yourself and therefore I shall not repeat itYet remember as an aggravation of your guilt that the last mark of my bounty was conferr'd upon you in the very instant when you were undermining my designs Now Sir I have but one thing more to say to youTake my daughter was she worth a million she is at your service  Lion  To me Siryour daughterdo you give her to meWithout fortunewithout friendswithout  Sir John  You have them all in your heart him whom virtue raises fortune cannot abase  Clar  O Sir let me on my knees kiss that dear handacknowledge my error and intreat forgiveness and blessing  Sir John  You have not erred my dear daughter you have distinguish'd It is I should ask pardon for this little trial of you for I am happier in the soninlaw you have given me than if you had married a prince  Lion  My patronmy friendmy fatherI would fain say something but as your goodness exceeds all bounds  Sir John  I think I hear a coach drive into the court it is Colonel Oldboy's family I will go and receive them Don't make yourselves uneasy at this we must endeavour to pacify them as well as we can My dear Lionel if I have made you happy you have made me so Heaven bless you my children and make you deserving of one another  SCENE XI  CLARISSA LIONEL JENNY  Jen  O dear Madam upon my knees I humbly beg your forgiveness Dear Mr Lionel forgive me I did not design to discover it indeed and you won't turn me off Madam will you I'll serve you for nothing  Clar  Get up my good Jenny I freely forgive you if there is any thing to be forgiven I know you love me and I am sure here is one who will join with me in rewarding your services  Jenny  Well if I did not know as sure as could be that some good would happen by my left eye itching this morning and people may say what they please but I shall have faith in dreams as long as I live  Lion  O bliss unexpected my joys overpow'r me  My love my Clarissa what words shall I find  Remorse desperation no longer devour me  He bless'd us and peace is restor'd to my mind  Clar  He bless'd usO raptureLike one I recover  Whom death had appal'd without hope

fates that decreed  A  But pain was inflicted by Heaven out of kindness  To heighten the joys that were doom'd to succeed  Our day was o'ercast  But brighter the scene is  The sky more serene is  And

 JOHN FLOWERDALE  enters with Colonel  OLDBOY  Lady M  'Tis all in vain my dear set me down any where I can't go a step further I knew when Mr Oldboy insisted upon my coming that I should be seized with a meagrim by the way and it's well I did not die in the coach  Mr Jess  But pr'thee why will you let yourself be affected with such triflesNothing more common than for young women of fashion to go off with low fellows  Lady M  Only feel my dear how I tremble Not a nerve but what is in agitation and my blood runs cold cold  Mr Jess  Well but Lady Mary don't let us expose ourselves to those people I see there is not one of the rascals about us that has not a grin upon his countenance  Lady M  Expose ourselves my dear Your father will be as ridiculous as Hudibrass or Don Quixote  Mr  Jess  Yes he will be very ridiculous indeed  Sir Jo  I give you my word my good friend and neighbour the joy I feel upon this occasion is greatly allayed by the disappointment of an alliance with your family but I have explained to you how things have happenedYou see my situation and as you are kind enough to consider it yourself I hope you will excuse it to your son  Lady M  Sir John Flowerdale how do you do you see we have obey'd your summons and I have the pleasure to assure you that my son yielded to my intreaties with very little disagrement in short if I may speak metaphorically he is content to stand candidate again notwithstanding his late repulse when he hopes for an unanimous election  Col  Well but my Lady you may save your rhetoric for the borough is disposed of to a worthier member  Mr Jess  What do you say Sir  SCENE XIII  Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE  Lady  MARY OLDBOY  Mr  JESSAMY  Colonel  OLDBOY LIONEL CLARISSA JENNY  Sir John  Here are my son and daughter  Lady M  Is this pretty Sir John  Sir John  Believe me Madam it is not for want of a just sense of Mr Jessamy's merit that this affair has gone off on any side but the heart is a delicate thing and after it has once felt if the object is meritorious the impression is not easily effac'd it would therefore have been an injury to him to have given him in appearance what another in reality possessed  Mr Jess  Upon my honour upon my soul Sir John I am not the least offended at this  contre temps  Pray Lady Mary say no more about it  Col  Tol lol lol lol  Sir John  But my dear Colonel I am afraid after all this affair is taken amiss by you yes I see you are angry on your son's account but let me repeat it I have a very high opinion of his merit  Col  Aythat's more than I haveTaken amiss I don't take any thing amiss I never was in better spirits or more pleased in my life  ir John  Come you are uneasy at something Colonel  Col  Me Gad I am not uneasyare you a justice of peace Then you could give me a warrant cou'd'nt you You must know Sir John a little accident has happen'd in my family since I saw you last you and I may shake handsDaughters Sir daughters Your's has snapt at a young fellow without your approbation and how do you think mine has serv'd me this morning only run away with the scoundrel I brought to dinner here yesterday  Sir John  I am excessively concerned  Col  Now I'm not a bit concern'dNo damn me I am glad it has happened yet thus far I'll confess I should be sorry that either of them would come in my way because a man's temper may sometimes get the better of him and I believe I should be tempted to break her neck and blow his brains out  Clar  But pray Sir explain this affair  Col  I can explain it no fartherDy my daughter Dy has run away from us  SCENE XIV  Sir  JOHN FLOWERDALE  Colonel  OLDBOY  Lady  MARY OLDBOY  Mr  JESSAMY CLARISSA LIONEL JENNY DIANA HARMAN JENKINS  Dian  No my dear papa I am not run away and upon my knees I intreat your pardon for the folly I have committed but let it be some alleviation that duty affection were too strong to suffer me to carry it to extremity and if you knew the agony I have been in since I saw you last  Lady M  How's this  Har  Sir I restore your daughter to you whose fault as far as it goes I must also take upon myself we have been known to each other sometime as Lady Richly your sister in London can acquaint you  Col  Dy come hereNow you rascal where's your sword if you are a gentleman you shall fight me if you are a scrub I'll horsewhip youDraw Sirrah Shut the door there don't let him escape  Har  Sir don't imagine I want to escape I am extremely sorry for what has happened but am ready to give you any satisfaction you think proper  Col  Follow me into the garden thenZounds I have no sword about meSir John Flowerdalelend us a case of pistols or a couple of guns and come and see fair play  Clar  My dear papa  Dian  Sir John FlowerdaleO my indiscretion we came here Sir to beg your mediation in our favour  Lady M  Mr Oldboy if you attempt to fight I shall expire  Sir John  Pray Colonel let me speak a word to you in private  Col  Slugs and a sawpit  Mr Jess  Why Miss Dy you are a perfect heroine for a romanceAnd pray who is this courteous knight  Lady M  O Sir you that I thought such a pretty behav'd gentleman  Mr Jess  What business are you of friend  Har  My chief trade Sir is plain dealing and as that is a commodity you have no reason to be very fond of I would not advise you to purchase any of it by impertinence  Col  And is this what you would advise me to  Sir John  It is indeed my dear old friend as things are situated there is in my opinion no other prudent method of proceeding and it is the method I would adopt myself was I in your case  Col  Why I believe you are in the right of itsay what you will for me then  Sir John  Well young people I have been able to use a few arguments which have softned my neighbour here and in some measure pacified his resentment I find Sir you are a gentleman by your connections  Har  Sir till it is found that my character and family will bear the strictest scrutiny I desire no favour And for fortune  Col  Oh Rot your fortune I don't mind thatI know you are gentleman or Dick Rantum would not have recommended you And so Dy kiss and friends  Mr Jess  What Sir have you no more to say to the man who has used you so ill  Col  Us'd me illThat's as I take ithe has done a mettled thing and perhaps I like him the better for it it's long before you would have spirit enough to run away with a wenchHarman give me your  hand let's hear no more of this nowSir John Flowerdale what say you shall we spend the day together and dedicate it to love and harmony  Sir John  With all my heart  Col  Then take off my greatcoat  Lion  Come then all ye social pow'rs  Shed your influence o'er us  Crown with bliss the present hours  And lighten those before us  May the just the gen'rous kind  Still see that you regard 'em  And Lionels for ever find  Clarissa's to reward 'em  Clar  Love thy godhead I adore  Source of sacred passion  But will never bow before  Those idols wealth or fashion  May like me each maiden wise  From the fop defend her  Learning sense and virtue prize  And scorn the vain pretender  Har  Why the plague should men be sad  While in time we moulder  Grave or gay or vex'd or glad  We ev'ry day grow older  Bring the flask the music bring  Joy will quickly find us  Drink and laugh and dance and sing  And cast our cares behind us  Dian  How shall I escapeso naught  On filial laws to trample  I'll e'en curtsey own my fault  And plead papa's example  Parents 'tis a hint to you  Children oft are shameless  Oft transgressthe things too true  But are you always blameless  Col  One word more before we go  Girls and boys have patience  You to friends must something owe  As well as to relations  These kind genelemen address  What tho' we forgave 'em  Still they must be lost unless  You lend a hand to save 'em  END OF THE OPERA
