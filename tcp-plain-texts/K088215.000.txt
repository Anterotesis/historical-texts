 A DEFENCE OF FreeThinking IN  MATHEMATICS  In Answer To a Pamphlet of  Philalethes Cantabrigiensis  intituled  Geometry no Friend to Infidelity or a Defence of Sir  ISAAC NEWTON  and the  BRITISH  Mathematicians  Also an Appendix concerning Mr WALTON'S  Vindication of the Principles of Fluxions against the Objections contained in the  ANALYST  WHEREIN It is attempted to put this Controversy in such a Light as that every Reader may be able to judge thereof  By the Author of  The Minute Philosopher  Veritas odium parit  Ter    Aristot Metaph l xiij  LONDON  Printed for J TONSON  MDCCXXXV  A DEFENCE OF FREETHINKING IN MATHEMATICS  c  I _WHEN I read your Defence of the  British  Mathematicians I could not Sir but admire your Courage in asserting with such undoubting Assurance things so easily disproved This to me seemed unaccountable till I reflected on what you say  p  when upon my having appealed to every thinking Reader whether it be possible to frame any clear Conception of Fluxions you express yourself in the following manner "Pray Sir who are those thinking Readers you appeal  to Are they Geometricians or Persons wholly ignorant of Geometry If the former I leave it to them If the latter I ask how well are they qualified to judge of the Method of Fluxions" It must be acknowledged you seem by this Dilemma secure in the favour of one Part of your Readers and the ignorance of the other I am nevertheless persuaded there are fair and candid Men among the Mathematicians And for those who are not Mathematicians I shall endeavour so to unveil this Mystery and put the Controversy between us in such a Light as that every Reader of ordinary Sense and Reflection may be a competent Judge thereof  II "YOU express an extreme Surprize and Concern that I should take so much Pains to depreciate one of the noblest Sciences to disparage and traduce a Set of learned Men whose Labours so greatly conduce to the Honour of this Island  p  to lessen the Reputation and Authority of Sir  Isaac Newton  and his Followers by shewing that they are not such Masters of Reason as they are generally presumed to be and to depreciate the Science they profess by demonstrating to the World that it  is not of the Clearness and Certainty as is commonly imagined All which you insist appears very strange to you and the rest of that famous University who plainly see of how great Use Mathematical Learning is to Mankind" Hence you take occasion to declaim on the Usefulness of Mathematics in the several Branches and then to redouble your Surprize and Amazement  p  and To all which Declamation I reply that it is quite beside the Purpose For I allow and always have allowed its full claim of Merit to whatever is useful and true in the Mathematics But that which is not so the less it employs Men's time and thoughts the better And after all you have said or can say I believe the unprejudiced Reader will think with me that things obscure are not therefore sacred and that it is no more a Crime to canvass and detect unsound Principles or false Reasonings in Mathematics than in any other Part of Learning  III YOU are it seems much at a loss to understand the Usefulness or Tendency or Prudence of my Attempt I thought I had sufficiently explained this in the  Analyst  But for your further Satisfaction shall here tell you it is very well known that  several Persons who deride Faith and Mysteries in Religion admit the Doctrine of Fluxions for true and certain Now if it be shewn that Fluxions are really most incomprehensible Mysteries and that those who believe them to be clear and scientific do entertain an implicite Faith in the Author of that Method will not this furnish a fair  Argumentum ad Hominem  against Men who reject that very thing in Religion which they admit in human Learning And is it not a proper Way to abate the Pride and discredit the Pretensions of those who insist upon clear Ideas in Points of Faith if it be shewn that they do without them even in Science  IV AS to my timeing this Charge why now and not before since I had published Hints thereof many Years ago Surely I am obliged to give no Account of this If what hath been said in the Analyst be not sufficient suppose that I had not Leisure or that I did not think it expedient or that I had no Mind to it When a Man thinks fit to publish any Thing either in Mathematics or in any other Part of Learning what avails it or indeed what Right hath any one to ask why at this or that Time in this or that Manner upon this or that Motive Let the Reader judge if it suffice  not that what I publish is true and that I have a Right to publish such Truths when and how I please in a free Country  V I DO not say that Mathematicians as such are Infidels or that Geometry is a Friend to Infidelity which you untruly insinuate as you do many other Things whence you raise Topics for invective But I say there are certain Mathematicians who are known to be so and that there are others who are not Mathematicians who are influenced by a Regard for their Authority Some perhaps who live in the University may not be apprised of this but the intelligent and observing Reader who lives in the World and is acquainted with the Humour of the Times and the Characters of Men is well aware there are too many that deride Mysteries and yet admire Fluxions who yield that Faith to a mere Mortal which they deny to  Jesus Christ  whose Religion they make it their Study and Business to discredit The owning this is not to own that Men who reason well are Enemies to Religion as you would represent it On the contrary I endeavour to shew that such Men are defective in Point of Reason and Judgment and that they do the very Thing they would seem to despise  VI THERE are I make no doubt among the Mathematicians many sincere Believers in  Jesus Christ  I know several such my self but I addressed my Analyst to an Infidel and on very good Grounds I supposed that besides him there were other Deriders of Faith who had nevertheless a profound Veneration for Fluxions and I was willing to set forth the Inconsistence of such Men If there be no such Thing as Infidels who pretend to Knowledge in the modern Analysis I own my self misinformed and shall gladly be found in a Mistake but even in that Case my Remarks upon Fluxions are not the less true nor will it follow that I have no Right to examine them on the Foot of humane Science even though Religion were quite unconcerned and though I had no End to serve but Truth But you are very angry  P    and  that I should enter the Lists with reasoning Infidels and attack them upon their Pretensions to Science And hence you take Occasion to shew your Spleen against the Clergy I will not take upon me to say that I know you to be a Minute Philosopher your self But I know the Minute Philosophers make just such Compliments as you do to our Church and are just as angry as you can be at any who undertake to defend Religion by Reason If  we resolve all into Faith they laugh at us and our Faith And if we attempt to Reason they are angry at us They pretend we go out of our Province and they recommend to us a blind implicite Faith Such is the Inconsistence of our Adversaries But it is to be hoped there will never be wanting Men to deal with them at their own Weapons and to shew they are by no Means those Masters of Reason which they would fain pass for  VII I DO not say as you would represent me that we have no better Reason for our Religion than you have for Fluxions But I say that an Infidel who believes the Doctrine of Fluxions acts a very inconsistent Part in pretending to reject the Christian Religion because he cannot believe what he doth not comprehend or because he cannot assent without Evidence or because he cannot submit his Faith to Authority Whether there are such Infidels I submit to the Judgment of the Reader For my own Part I make no Doubt of it having seen some shrewd Signs thereof my self and having been very credibly informed thereof by others Nor doth this Charge seem the less credible for your being so sensibly touched and denying it with so much Passion You indeed do not stick to affirm  that the persons who informed me are  a pack of base profligate and impudent liars    P  How far the Reader will think fit to adopt your passions I cannot say but I can truly say the late celebrated Mr  Addison  is one of the persons whom you are pleased to characterize in those modest and mannerly terms He assured me that the Infidelity of a certain noted Mathematician still living was one principal reason assigned by a witty man of those times for his being an Infidel Not that I imagine Geometry disposeth Men to Infidelity but that from other causes such as Presumption Ig+norance or Vanity like other Men Geometricians also become Infidels and that the supposed light and evidence of their Science gains credit to their Infidelity  VIII "YOU reproach me with Calumny detraction and artifice  P  You recommend such means as are innocent and just rather than the criminal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents  ibid  You accuse me of the  Odium Theologicum  the intemperate Zeal of Divines that I do  stare super vias antiquas  "  P  with much more to the same effect For all which charge I depend on the reader's candour that he will not take your word  but read and judge for himself In which case he will be able to discern though he should be no Mathematician how passionate and unjust your reproaches are and how possible it is for a Man to cry out against Calumny and practise it in the same breath Considering how impatient all Mankind are when their prejudices are looked into I do not wonder to see you rail and rage at the rate you do But if your own Imagination be strongly shocked and moved you cannot therefore conclude that a sincere endeavour to free a science so useful and ornamental to Humane Life from those subtilties obscurities and paradoxes which render it inaccessible to most Men will be thought a criminal undertaking by such as are in their right Mind Much less can you hope that an illustrious seminary of Learned Men which hath produced so many freespirited inquirers after Truth will at once enter into your passions and degenerate into a nest of Bigots  IX I OBSERVE upon the Inconsistency of certain Infidel Analysts I remark some defects in the principles of the modern Analysis I take the liberty decently to dissent from Sir  Isaac Newton  I propose some helps to abridge the trouble of Mathematical Studies and render them  more useful What is there in all this that should make you declaim on the usefulness of practical Mathematics that should move you to cry out  Spain Inquisition Odium Theologicum  By what figure of Speech do you extend what is said of the modern Analysis to Mathematics in general or what is said of Mathematical Infidels to all Mathematicians or the confuting an errour in Science to burning or hanging the Authors But it is nothing new or strange that Men should choose to indulge their passions rather than quit their opinions how absurd soever Hence the frightful visions and tragical uproars of Bigotted Men be the Subject of their Bigotry what it will A very remarkable instance of this you give  P  where upon my having said that a deference to certain Mathematical Infidels as I was credibly informed had been one motive to Infidelity you ask with no small emotion "For God's sake are we in  England  or in  Spain  Is this the language of a Familiar who is whispering an Inquisitor  c  " And the page before you exclaim in the following Words "Let us burn or hang up all the Mathematicians in  Great Britain  or halloo the mob upon them to tear them to pieces every Mother's Son of them  Tros Rutulusve fuat  Laymen  or Clergymen  c  Let us dig up the bodies of Dr  Barrow  and Sir  Isaac Newton  and burn them under the Gallows"  X THE Reader need not be a Mathematician to see how vain all this Tragedy of yours is And if he be as thoroughly satisfied as I am that the cause of Fluxions cannot be defended by reason he will be as little surprised as I am to see you betake your self to the arts of all bigotted men raising terror and calling in the passions to your assistance Whether those Rhetorical flourishes about the Inquisition and the Gallows are not quite ridiculous I leave to be determined by the Reader Who will also judge though he should not be skilled in Geometry whether I have given the least grounds for this and a World of such like declamation and whether I have not constantly treated those celebrated Writers with all proper respect though I take the liberty in certain points to differ from them  XI AS I heartily abhor an Inquisition in Faith so I think you have no right to erect one in Science At the time of writing your defence you seem to have been  overcome with Passion But now you may be supposed cool I desire you to reflect whether it be not wrote in the true spirit of an Inquisitor Whether this becomes a Person so exceeding delicate himself upon that Point And whether your Brethren the  Analysts  will think themselves honoured or obliged by you for having defended their Doctrine in the same manner as any declaiming Bigot would defend Transubstantiation The same false colours the same intemperate Sallies and the same Indignation against common Sense  XII IN a matter of mere Science where authority hath nothing to do you constantly endeavour to overbear me with authorities and load me with envy If I see a Sophism in the writings of a great Author and in compliment to his understanding suspect he could hardly be quite satisfy'd with his own demonstration This sets you on declaiming for several pages It is pompously set forth as a criminal method of detracting from great men as a concerted project to lessen their reputation as making them pass for impostors If I publish my free thoughts which I have as much right to publish  any other man it is imputed to rashness  and vanity and the love of opposition Though perhaps my late publication of what had been hinted twenty five years ago may acquit me of this charge in the eyes of an impartial Reader But when I consider the perplexities that beset a man who undertakes to defend the doctrine of Fluxions I can easily forgive your anger  XIII TWO sorts of learned men there are one who candidly seek Truth by rational means These are never averse to have their principles looked into and examined by the test of Reason Another sort there is who learn by  route  a set of principles and a way of thinking which happen to be in vogue These betray themselves by their anger and surprise whenever their principles are freely canvassed But you must not expect that your Reader will make himself a party to your passions or your prejudices I freely own that Sir  Isaac Newton  hath shew'd himself an extraordinary Mathematician a profound Naturalist a Person of the greatest Abilities and Erudition Thus far I can readily go but I cannot go the lengths that you do I shall never say of him as you do  Vestigia pronus adoro    p  This same adoration that you pay to him I will pay only to Truth  XIV YOU may indeed your self be an Idolater of whom you please But then you have no right to insult and exclaim at other men because they do not adore your Idol Great as Sir  Isaac Newton  was I think he hath on more occasions than one shew'd himself not to be infallible Particularly his demonstration of the Doctrine of Fluxions I take to be defective and I cannot help thinking that he was not quite pleased with it himself And yet this doth not hinder but the method may be useful considered as an art of Invention You who are a Mathematician must acknowledge there have been divers such methods admitted in Mathematics which are not demonstrative Such for instance are the Inductions of Doctor  Wallis  in his Arithmetic of Infinites and such what  Harriot  and after him  Descartes  have wrote concerning the roots of affected Aequations It will not nevertheless thence follow that those methods are useless but only that they are not to be allowed of as Premisses in a strict Demonstration  XV NO great Name upon earth shall ever make me accept things obscure for clear or Sophisms for Demonstrations Nor may you ever hope to deter me from freely speaking what I freely think by  those arguments  ab invidia  which at every turn you employ against me You represent your self  P  as a man  whose highest Ambition is in the lowest degree to imitate Sir  Isaac Newton It might perhaps have suited better with your appellation of  Philalethes  and been altogether as laudable if your highest ambition had been to discover Truth Very consistently with the character you give of your self you speak of it as a sort of crime  P  to think it possible you should ever  see further or go beyond Sir  Isaac Newton And I am persuaded you speak the Sentiments of many more besides your self But there are others who are not afraid to sift the Principles of human Science who think it no honour to imitate the greatest man in his Defects who even think it no crime to desire to know not only beyond Sir  Isaac Newton  but beyond all Mankind And whoever thinks otherwise I appeal to the Reader whether he can properly be called a Philosopher  XVI BECAUSE I am not guilty of your mean Idolatry you inveigh against me as a person conceited of my own Abilities not considering that a person of less Abilities may know more on a certain point than one of greater not considering that a purblind eye in a close and  narrow view may discern more of a thing than a much better eye in a more extensive prospect not considering that this is to fix a  ne plus ultra  to put a stop to all future inquiries Lastly not considering that this is in fact so much as in you lies converting the Republick of Letters into an absolute Monarchy that it is even introducing a kind of Philosophic Popery among a free People  XVII I HAVE said and I venture still to say that a Fluxion is incomprehensible That second third and fourth Fluxions are yet more incomprehensible That it is not possible to conceive a simple Infinitesimal that it is yet less possible to conceive an Infinitesimal of an Infinitesimal and so onward  Analyst  Sect  c  What have you to say in answer to this Do you attempt to clear up the notion of a Fluxion or a Difference Nothing like it "you only assure me upon your bare word from your own experience and that of several others whom you could name that the Doctrine of Fluxions may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended and that if I am puzzled about it and do not understand it yet others do" But can you think Sir I shall take your word when I refuse to take your Master's  XVIII UPON this point every Reader of common sense may judge as well as the most profound Mathematician The simple apprehension of a thing defined is not made more perfect by any subsequent progress in Mathematics What any man evidently knows he knows as well as you or Sir  Isaac Newton  And every one can know whether the object of this method be as you would have us think clearly conceivable To judge of this no depth of Science is requisite but only a bare attention to what passes in his own mind And the same is to be understood of all definitions in all Sciences whatsoever In none of which can it be supposed that a man of Sense and Spirit will take any definition or principle upon trust without sifting it to the bottom and trying how far he can or he cannot conceive it This is the course I have taken and shall take however you and your Brethren may declaim against it and place it in the most invidious Light  XIX IT is usual with you to admonish me to look over a second time to consult examine weigh the words of Sir  Isaac  In answer to which I will venture to say that I have taken as much pains as I sincerely believe any man  living to understand that great Author and to make sense of his principles No industry nor caution nor attention I assure you have been wanting on my part So that if I do not understand him it is not my fault but my misfortune Upon other subjects you are pleased to compliment me with depth of thought and uncommon abilities  P  and But I freely own I have no pretence to those things The only advantage I pretend to is that I have always thought and judged for my self And as I never had a master in Mathematics so I fairly followed the dictates of my own mind in examining and censuring the authors I read upon that subject with the same freedom that I used upon any other taking nothing upon trust and believing that no writer was infallible And a man of moderate parts who takes this painful course in studying the principles of any Science may be supposed to walk more surely than those of greater abilities who set out with more speed and less care  XX WHAT I insist on is that the idea of a Fluxion simply considered is not at all improved or amended by any progress though ever so great in the Analysis neither are the demonstrations of the  general rules of that method at all cleared up by applying them The reason of which is because in operating or calculating men do not return to contemplate the original principles of the method which they constantly presuppose but are employed in working by notes and symbols denoting the Fluxions supposed to have been at first explained and according to rules supposed to have been at first demonstrated This I say to encourage those who are not far gone in these Studies to use intrepidly their own judgment without a blind or a mean deference to the best of Mathematicians who are no more qualify'd than they are to judge of the simple apprehension or the evidence of what is delivered in the first elements of the method men by further and frequent use or exercise becoming only more accustomed to the symbols and rules which doth not make either the foregoing notions more clear or the foregoing proofs more perfect Every Reader of common sense that will but use his faculties knows as well as the most profound Analyst what idea he frames or can frame of Velocity without motion or of motion without extension of magnitude which is neither finite nor infinite or of a quantity having no magnitude which is yet divisible of a figure where there is no space of proportion  between nothings or of a real product from nothing multiplied by something He need not be far gone in Geometry to know that obscure principles are not to be admitted in Demonstration That if a man destroys his own Hypothesis he at the same time destroys what was built upon it That error in the premises not rectified must produce error in the conclusion  XXI IN my opinion the greatest men have their Prejudices Men learn the elements of Science from others And every learner hath a deference more or less to authority especially the young learners few of that kind caring to dwell long upon principles but inclining rather to take them upon trust And things early admitted by repetition become familiar And this familiarity at length passeth for Evidence Now to me it seems there are certain points tacitly admitted by Mathematicians which are neither evident nor true And such points or principles ever mixing with their reasoning do lead them into paradoxes and perplexities If the great author of the fluxionary method was early imbued with such notions it would only shew he was a man And if by virtue of some latent error in his principles a man be drawn into fallacious reasonings it is nothing strange that he should take  them for true And nevertheless if when urged by perplexities and uncouth consequences and driven to arts and shifts he should entertain some doubt thereof it is no more than one may naturally suppose might befall a great genious grappling with an insuperable difficulty Which is the light in which I have placed Sir  Isaac Newton  Analyst  Sect xviij  Herereupon you are pleased to remark that I represent the great author not only as a weak but an ill man as a Deceiver and an Impostor The Reader will judge how justly  XXII AS to the rest of your colourings and glosses your reproaches and insults and outcries I shall pass them over only desiring the Reader not to take your word but read what I have written and he will want no other answer It hath been often observed that the worst cause produceth the greatest clamour and indeed you are so clamorous throughout your defence that the Reader although he should be no Mathematician provided he understands common sense and hath observed the ways of men will be apt to suspect you are in the wrong It should seem therefore that your Brethren the Analysts are but little obliged to you for  this new method of declaiming in Mathematics Whether they are more obliged by your Reasoning I shall now examine  XXIII YOU ask me  p  where I find Sir  Isaac Newton  using such expressions as the Velocities of Velocities the second third and fourth Velocities  c  This you set forth as a pious fraud and unfair representation I answer that if according to Sir  Isaac Newton  a Fluxion be the velocity of an increment then according to him I may call the Fluxion of a Fluxion the Velocity of a Velocity But for the truth of the antecedent see his introduction to the Quadrature of Curves where his own words are  motuum velincrementorum velocitates nominando Fluxiones  See also the second Lemma of the second Book of his mathematical principles of natural Philosophy where he expresseth himself in the following manner  velocitates incrementorum ac decrementorum quas etiam motus mutationes fluxiones quantitatum nominare licet  And that he admits Fluxions of Fluxions or second third fourth Fluxions  c  see his Treatise of the Quadrature of Curves I ask now Is it not plain that if a Fluxion be a Velocity then the Fluxion of a Fluxion may agreeably thereunto be called the Velocity of a Velocity In like manner if by a Fluxion  is meant a nascent augment will it not then follow that the Fluxion of a Fluxion or second Fluxion is the nascent augment of a nascent augment Can any thing be plainer Let the Reader now judge who is unfair  XXIV I HAD observed that the Great Author had proceeded illegitimately in obtaining the Fluxion or moment of the Rectangle of two flowing quantities and that he did not fairly get rid of the Rectangle of the moments In answer to this you alledge that the error arising from the omission of such rectangle allowing it to be an error is so small that it is insignificant This you dwell upon and examplify to no other purpose but to amuse your Reader and mislead him from the Question which in truth is not concerning the accuracy of computing or measuring in practice but concerning the accuracy of the reasoning in science That this was really the case and that the smallness of the practical error no wise concerns it must be so plain to any one who reads the Analyst that I wonder how you could be ignorant of it  XXV YOU would fain persuade your Reader that I make an absurd quarrel against errors of no significancy in practice and represent Mathematicians as proceeding  blindfold in their approximations in all which I cannot help thinking there is on your part either great ignorance or great disingenuity If you mean to defend the reasonableness and use of approximations or of the method of Indivisibles I have nothing to say But then you must remember this is not the Doctrine of Fluxions It is none of that Analysis with which I am concerned That I am far from quarrelling at approximations in Geometry is manifest from the thirty third and fifty third Queries in the Analyst And that the method of Fluxions pretends to somewhat more than the method of Indivisibles is plain because Sir  Isaac  disclaims this method as not Geometrical  See the Schelium at the end of the first Section  Lib Phil Nat Princip Math  And that the method of Fluxions is supposed accurate in Geometrical rigour is manifest to whoever considers what the Great Author writes about it especially in his Introduction to the Quadrature of Curves where he saith  In rebus mathematicis errores quam minimi non sunt contemnendi  Which expression you have seen quoted in the Analyst and yet you seem ignorant thereof and indeed of the very End and Design of the Great Author in this his invention of Fluxions  XXVI AS oft as you talk of finite quantities inconsiderable in practice Sir  Isaac  disowns your apology  Cave  saith he  intellexeris finitas  And although Quantities less than sensible may be of no account in practice yet none of your masters nor will even you yourself venture to say they are of no account in Theory and in Reasoning The application in gross practice is not the point questioned but the rigour and justness of the reasoning And it is evident that be the subject ever so little or ever so inconsiderable this doth not hinder but that a person treating thereof may commit very great errors in Logic which Logical errors are in no wise to be measured by the sensible or practical inconveniences thence arising which perchance may be none at all It must be owned that after you have mislead and amused your less qualified Reader as you call him you return to the real point in controversy and set your self to justifie Sir  Isaac  's method of getting rid of the abovementioned Rectangle And here I must intreat the Reader to observe how fairly you proceed  XXVII FIRST then you affirm  P  "that neither in the Demonstration of the Rule for finding the Fluxion of the rectangle of two flowing quantities nor in  any thing preceding or following it is any mention so much as once made of the increment of the rectangle of such flowing quantities" Now I affirm the direct contrary For in the very passage by you quoted in this same page from the first case of the second lemma of the second Book of Sir  Isaac  's Principles beginning with  Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo auctum  and ending with  igitur laterum incrementis totis a et b generatur rectanguli incrementum a B  x  b A Q E D  In this very passage I say is express mention made of the increment of such rectangle As this is matter of fact I refer it to the Reader's own eyes Of what rectangle have we here the Increment Is it not plainly of that whose sides have  a  and  b  for their  Incrementa tota  that is of  AB  Let any Reader judge whether it be not plain from the words the sense and the context that the Great Author in the end of his demonstration understands his  incrementum  as belonging to the  Rectangulum quodvis  at the beginning Is not the same also evident from the very Lemma it self prefixed to the Demonstration The sense whereof is as the Author there explains it that if the moments of the flowing quantities  A  and  B  are called  a  and  b  then the  momentum vel mutatio geniti rectanguli AB  will be  a B  x  b A  Either therefore the conclusion of the demonstration is not the thing which was to be demonstrated or the  rectanguli incrementum a B  x  b A  belongs to the rectangle  AB  XXVIII ALL this is so plain that nothing can be more so and yet you would fain perplex this plain case by distinguishing between an increment and a moment But it is evident to every one who has any notion of Demonstration that the  incrementum  in the Conclusion must be the  momentum  in the Lemma and to suppose it otherwise is no credit to the Author It is in effect supposing him to be one who did not know what he would demonstrate But let us hear Sir  Isaac  's own words  Earum quantitatum scilicet fluentium incrementa vel decrementa momentanea sub nomine momentorum intelligo  And you observe your self that he useth the word  moment  to signify either an increment or decrement Hence with an intention to puzzle me you propose the increment and decrement of  AB  and ask which of these I would call the moment The case you say is difficult My answer is very plain and easy to wit Either of them You indeed make a different answer and from the Author's saying that by a moment he understands either the momentaneous increment or decrement of the  flowing quantities you would have us conclude by a very wonderful inference that his moment is neither the increment nor decrement thereof Would it not be as good an inference Because a number is either odd or even to conclude it is neither Can any one make sense of this Or can even your self hope that this will go down with the Reader how little soever qualified It must be owned you endeavour to obtrude this inference on him rather by mirth and humour than by reasoning You are merry I say and  P  represent the two mathematical quantities as pleading their rights as tossing up cross and pile as disputing amicably You talk of their claiming preference their agreeing their boyishness and their gravity And after this ingenious digression you address me in the following wordsBelieve me there is no remedy you must acquiesce But my answer is that I will neither believe you nor acquiesce there is a plain remedy in common sense and to prevent surprise I desire the Reader always to keep the controverted point in view to examine your reasons and be cautious how he takes your word but most of all when you are positive or eloquent or merry  XXIX A PAGE or two after you very candidly represent your case to be that of an Ass between two bottles of hay it is your own expression The cause of your perplexity is that you know not whether the velocity of  AB  increasing or of  AB  decreasing is to be esteemed the Fluxion or proportional to the moment of the rectangle My opinion agreeably to what hath been premised is that either may be deemed the Fluxion But you tell us "  P  that you think the venerable ghost of Sir  Isaac Newton  whispers you The Velocity you seek for is neither the one nor the other of these but is the velocity which the flowing rectangle hath not while it is greater or less than  AB  but at that very instant of time that it is  AB  " For my part in the rectangle  AB  considered simply in it self without either increasing or diminishing I can conceive no velocity at all And if the Reader is of my mind he will not take either your word or even the word of a Ghost how venerable soever for velocity without motion You proceed and tell us that in like manner the moment of the rectangle is neither its increment or decrement This you would have us believe on the authority of his Ghost in direct opposition to what Sir  Isaac  himself asserted when alive  Incrementa  saith he  vel decrementa momentanea sub nomine momentorum intelligo ita ut incrementa pro momentis addititiis seu affirmativis ac decrementa prosubductitiis seu negativis habeantur  Princip Phil Nat Lib II Lem II  I will not in your style bid the Reader believe me but believe his eyes  XXX TO me it verily seems that you have undertaken the defence of what you do not understand To mend the matter you say "you do not consider  AB  as lying at either extremity of the moment but as extended to the middle of it as having acquired the one half of the moment and as being about to acquire the other or as having lost one half of it and being about to lose the other" Now in the name of Truth I intreat you to tell what this moment is to the middle whereof the rectangle is extended This moment I say which is acquired which is lost which is cut in two or distinguished into halfs Is it a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit or nothing at all Take it in what sense you will I cannot make your defence either consistent or intelligible For if you take it in either of the two former senses you contradict Sir  Isaac Newton  And if you take it in  either of the latter you contradict common sense it being plain that what hath no magnitude or is no quantity cannot be divided And here I must intreat the Reader to preserve his full freedom of mind intire and not weakly suffer his judgment to be overborn by your imagination and your prejudices by great names and authorities by Ghosts and Visions and above all by that extreme satisfaction and complacency with which you utter your strange conceits if words without a meaning may be called so After having given this unintelligible account you ask with your accustomed air "What say you Sir Is this a just and legitimate reason for Sir  Isaac  's proceeding as he did I think you must acknowledge it to be so" But alas I acknowledge no such thing I find no sense or reason in what you say Let the Reader find it if he can  XXXI IN the next Place  P  you charge me with want of caution "Inasmuch say you as that quantity which Sir  Isaac Newton  through his whole Lemma and all the several Cases of it constantly calls a  Moment  without confining it to be either an increment or decrement is by you inconsiderately and arbitrarily and without any Shadow of  of Reasou given supposed and determined to be an increment" To which Charge I reply that it is as untrue as it is peremptory For that in the foregoing citation from the first case of Sir  Isaac  's Lemma he expresly determines it to be an Increment And as this particular Instance or Passage was that which I objected to it was reasonable and proper for me to consider the Moment in that same Light But take it increment or decrement as you will the Objections still lie and the Difficulties are equally insuperable You then proceed to extoll the great Author of the fluxionary Method and to bestow some  Brusqueries  upon those who unadvisedly dare to differ from him To all which I shall give no answer  XXXII AFTERWARDS to remove as you say all Scruple and Difficulty about this affair you observe that the Moment of the Rectangle determined by Sir  Isaac Newton  and the Increment of the Rectangle determined by me are perfectly and exactly equal supposing  a  and  b  to be diminished  ad infinitum  and for proof of this you refer to the first Lemma of the first Section of the first Book of Sir  Isaac  's Principles I answer that if  a  and  b  are real quantities then  a b  is something and  consequently makes a real difference but if they are nothing then the Rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise and consequently the  momentum  or  incrementum  whether Sir  Isaac  's or mine are in that Case nothing at all As for the abovementioned Lemma which you refer to and which you wish I had consulted sooner both for my own sake and for yours I tell you I had long since consulted and considered it But I very much doubt whether you have sufficiently considered that Lemma its Demonstration and its Consequences For however that way of reasoning may do in the Method of  exhaustions  where quantities less than assignable are regarded as nothing yet for a Fluxionist writing about momentums to argue that quantities must be equal because they have no assignable difference seems the most injudicious Step that could be taken it is directly demolishing the very Doctrine you would defend For it will thence follow that all homogeneous momentums are equal and consequently the velocities mutations or fluxions proportional thereto are all likewise equal There is therefore only one proportion of equality throughout which at once overthrows the whole System you undertake to defend Your  moments I say not being themselves assignable quantities their differences cannot be assignable and if this be true by that way of reasoning it will follow they are all equal upon which Supposition you cannot make one Step in the Method of Fluxiors It appears from hence how unjustly you blame me  P  for omitting to give any Account of that first Section of the first Book of the  Principia  wherein you say the Foundation of the Method of Fluxions is geometrically demonstrated and largely explained and difficulties and objections against it are clearly solved All which is so far from being true that the very first and fundamental Lemma of that Section is incompatible with and subversive of the doctrine of Fluxions And indeed who sees not that a Demonstration  ad absurdum more veterum  proceeding on a Supposition that every difference must be some given quantity cannot be admitted in or consist with a method wherein Quantities less than any given are supposed really to exist and be capable of division  XXXIII THE next point you undertake to defend is that method for obtaining a rule to find the Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity which is delivered in the introduction to the Quadratures  and considered in the Analyst  Sect  c  And here the question between us is whether I have rightly represented the sense of those words  evanescant jam augmenta illa  in rendering them let the increments vanish  i e  let the increments be nothing or let there be no increments This you deny but as your manner is instead of giving a reason you declaim I on the contrary affirm the increments must be understood to be quite gone and absolutely nothing at all My reason is because without that supposition you can never bring the quantity or expression  c  down to  the very thing aimed at by supposing the evanescence Say whether this be not the truth of the case Whether the former expression is not to be reduced to the latter And whether this can possibly be done so long as  o  is supposed a real Quantity I cannot indeed say you are scrupulous about your affirmations and yet I believe that even you will not affirm this it being most evident that the product of two real quantities is something real and that nothing real can be  rejected either according to the  of Geometry or according to Sir  Isaac  's own principles for the truth of which I appeal to all who know any thing of these matters Further by  evanescent  must either be meant let them the increments vanish and become nothing in the obvious sense or else let them become infinitely small But that this latter is not Sir  Isaac  's sense is evident from his own words in the very same page that is in the last of the Introduction to his Quadratures where he expressly saith  volui ostendere quod in methodo Fluxionum non opus fit figuras infinitè parvas in Geometriam introducere  Upon the whole you seem to have considered this affair so very superficially as greatly to confirm me in the opinion you are so angry with to wit that Sir  Isaac  's followers are much more eager in applying his method than accurate in examining his principles You raise a dust about evanescent augments which may perhaps amuse and amaze your Reader but I am much mistaken if it ever instructs or enlightens him For to come to the point those evanescent augments either are real quantities or they are not If you say they are I desire to know how you get rid of the rejectaneous quantity If you say they are not you indeed get rid of those quantities in the composition whereof they are coefficients but  then you are of the same opinion with me "which opinion you are pleased to call  P  a most palpable inexcusable and unpardonable blunder although it be a Truth most palpably evident"  XXXIV NOTHING I say can be plainer to any impartial Reader than that by the Evanescence of augments in the above cited passage Sir  Isaac  means their being actually reduced to nothing But to put it out of all doubt that this is the truth and to convince even you who shew so little disposition to be convinced I desire you to look into his  Analysis per aequationes infinitas    P  where in his preparation for demonstrating the first rule for the squaring of simple Curves you will find that on a parallel occasion speaking of an augment which is supposed to vanish he interprets the word  evanescere  by  esse nihil  Nothing can be plainer than this which at once destroys your defence And yet plain as it is I despair of making you acknowledge it though I am sure you feel it and the Reader if he useth his eyes must see it The words  Evanescere five esse nihil  do to use your own expression stare us in the face Lo "This is what you call  P  so great so unaccountable so horrid so truly  Boeotian  a blunder"  that according to you it was not possible Sir  Isaac Newton  could be guilty of it For the future I advise you to be more sparing of hard words Since as you incautiously deal them about they may chance to light on your friends as well as your adversaries As for my part I shall not retaliate It is sufficient to say you are mistaken But I can easily pardon your mistakes Though indeed you tell me on this very occasion that I must expect no quarter from Sir  Isaac  's followers And I tell you that I neither expect nor desire any My aim is truth My reasons I have given Confute them if you can But think not to overbear me either with authorities or harsh words The latter will recoil upon your selves The former in a matter of science are of no weight with indifferent Readers and as for Bigots I am not concerned about what they say or think  XXXV IN the next place you proceed to declaim upon the following passage taken from the seventeenth section of the Analyst "Considering the various arts and devices used by the great author of the fluxionary method In how many lights he placeth his Fluxions and in what different ways he attempts to  demonstrate the same point One would be inclined to think he was himself suspicious of the justness of his own demonstrations" This passage you complain of as very hard usage of Sir  Isaac Newton  You declaim copiously and endeavour to shew that placing the same point in various lights is of great use to explain it which you illustrate with much Rhetoric But the fault of that passage is not the hard usage it contains But on the contrary that it is too modest and not so full and expressive of my sense as perhaps it should have been Would you like it better if I should say the various  inconsistent  accounts which this great author gives of his momentums and his fluxions may convince every intelligent Reader that he had no clear and steady notions of them without which there can be no demonstration I own frankly that I see no clearness or consistence in them You tell me indeed in  Miltonic  verse that the fault is in my own eyes  So thick a drop serene has quench'd their orbs  Or dim Suffusion veil'd  At the same time you acknowledge your self obliged for those various lights which have enabled you to understand his Doctrine  But as for me who do not understand it you insult me saying "For God's sake what is it you are offended at who do not still understand him" May not I answer that I am offended for this very reason because I cannot understand him or make sense of what he says You say to me that I am all in the dark I acknowledge it and intreat you who see so clearly to help me out  XXXVI YOU Sir with the bright eyes be pleased to tell me whether Sir  Isaac  's momentum be a finite quantity or an infinitesimal or a mere limit If you say a finite quantity Be pleased to reconcile this with what he saith in the Scholium of the second Lemma of the first Section of the first book of his Principles  Cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas sed cogita semper diminuendas sine limite  If you say an infinitesimal reconcile this with what is said in the Introduction to his Quadratures  Volui oftendere quod in methodo Flaxionum non opus fit figuras infinitè parvas in Geometriam introducere  If you should say it is a mere limit be pleased to reconcile this with what we find in the first case of the second Lemma in the second book of his principles  Ubi de lateribus A et B  deerant momentorum dimidia  c where the moments are supposed to be divided I should be very glad a person of such luminous intellect would be so good as to explain whether by Fluxions we are to understand the nascent or evanescent quantities themselves or their motions or their Velocities or simply their proportions and having interpreted them in what sense you will that you would then condescend to explain the Doctrine of second third and fourth Fluxions and shew it to be consistent with common sense if you can You seem to be very sanguine when you express your self in the following terms "I do assure you Sir from my own Experience and that of many others whom I could name that the Doctrine may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended"  p  And it may be uncivil not to believe what you so solemnly affirm from your own experience But I must needs own I should be better fatisfied of this if instead of entertaining us with your Rhetoric you would vouchsafe to reconcile those difficulties and explain those obscure points abovementioned If either you or any one of those many whom you could name will but explain to others what you so clearly conceive your selves I give you my word  that several will be obliged to you who I may venture to say understand those matters no more than my self But if I am not much mistaken you and your friends will modestly decline this task  XXXVII I HAVE long ago done what you so often exhort me to do diligently read and considered the several accounts of this Doctrine given by the great Author in different parts of his writings and upon the whole I could never make it out to be consistent and intelligible I was even led to say "that one would be inclined to think He was himself suspicious of the justness of his own demonstrations and that he was not enough pleased with any one Notion steadily to adhere to it" After which I added "Thus much is plain that he owned himself satisfied concerning certain points which nevertheless he could not undertake to demonstrate to others" See the seventeenth section of the Analyst It is one thing when a Doctrine is placed in various lights and another when the principles and notions are shifted When new devices are introduced and substituted for others a Doctrine instead of being illustrated may be explained away Whether there be not something of this in  the present case I appeal to the writings of the Great Author His  methodus rationum primarum et ultimarum  His second Lemma in the second book of his principles his Introduction and Treatise of the Quadrature of Curves In all which it appears to me there is not one uniform doctrine explained and carried throughout the whole but rather sundry inconsistent accounts of this new Method which still grows more dark and confused the more it is handled I could not help thinking the greatest genius might lie under the influence of false principles and where the object and notions were exceeding obscure he might possibly distrust even his own demonstrations "At least thus much seemed plain that Sir  Isaac  had sometime owned himself satisfied where he could not demonstrate to others In proof whereof I mentioned his letter to Mr  Collins  Hereupon you tell me there is a great deal of difference between saying I cannot undertake to prove a thing and I will not undertake it" But in answer to this I desire you will be pleased to consider that I was not making a precise extract out of that letter in which the very words of Sir  Isaac  should alone be inserted But I made my own remark and inference  from what I remembred to have read in that letter where speaking of a certain Mathematical matter Sir  Isaac  expresseth himself in the following terms "It is plain to me by the fountain I draw it from though I will not undertake to prove it to others" Now whether my inference may not be fairly drawn from those words of Sir  Isaac Newton  and whether the difference as to the sense be so great between  will  and  can  in that particular case I leave to be determined by the Reader  XXXVIII IN the next paragraph you talk big but prove nothing You speak of driving out of intrenchments of sallying and attacking and carrying by assault of slight and untenable works of a newraised and undisciplined militia and of veteran regular troops Need the Reader be a Mathematician to see the vanity of this paragraph After this you employ  p  your usual colouring and represent the great Author of the method of Fluxions "as a Good old Gentleman fast asleep and snoring in his easy chair while dame Fortune is bringing him her apron full of beautiful theorems and problems which he never knows or thinks of" This you would have pass for a consequence  of my notions But I appeal to all those who are ever so little knowing in such matters whether there are not divers fountains of Experiment Induction and Analogy whence a man may derive and satisfy himself concerning the truth of many points in Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy although the proofs thereof afforded by the modern Analysis should not amount to demonstration I further appeal to the conscience of all the most profound Mathematicians whether they can with perfect acquiescence of mind free from all scruple apply any proposition merely upon the strength of a Demonstration involving second or third Fluxions without the aid of any such experiment or analogy or collateral proof whatsoever Lastly I appeal to the Reader's own heart whether he cannot clearly conceive a medium between being fast asleep and demonstrating But you will have it that I represent Sir  Isaac  's Conclusions as coming out right because one error is compensated by another contrary and equal error which perhaps he never knew himself nor thought of that by a twofold mistake he arrives though not at science yet at Truth that he proceeds blindfold  c  All which is untruly said by you who have misapplied to Sir  Isaac  what was intended for the Marquis  de l' Hospital  and his followers  for no other end as I can see but that you may have an opportunity to draw that ingenious portraiture of Sir  Isaac Newton  and Dame Fortune as will be manifest to whoever reads the Analyst  XXXIX YOU tell me  p  if I think fit to persist in asserting "that this affair of a double error is entirely a new discovery of my own which Sir  Isaac  and his followers never knew nor thought of that you have unquestionable evidence to convince me of the contrary and that all his followers are already apprised that this very objection of mine was long since foreseen and clearly and fully removed by Sir  Isaac Newton  in the first section of the first book of his  Principia  " All which I do as strongly deny as you affirm And I do aver that this is an unquestionable proof of the matchless contempt which you  Philalethes  have for Truth And I do here publickly call upon you to produce that evidence which you pretend to have and to make good that fact which you so confidently affirm And at the same time I do assure the Reader that you never will nor can  XL IF you defend Sir  Isaac  's notions as delivered in his  Principia  it must be on the rigorous foot of rejecting nothing neither admitting nor casting away infinitely small quantities If you defend the Marquis whom you also stile your Master it must be on the foot of admitting that there are infinitesimals that may be rejected that they are nevertheless real quantities and themselves infinitely subdivisible But you seem to have grown giddy with passion and in the heat of controversy to have mistaken and forgot your part I beseech you Sir to consider that the Marquis whom alone and not Sir  Isaac  this double error in finding the subtangent doth concern rejects indeed infinitesimals but not on the foot that you do to wit their being inconsiderable in practical Geometry or mixed Mathematics But he rejects them in the accuracy of Speculative Knowledge in which respect there may be great Logical errors although there should be no sensible mistake in practice which it seems is what you cannot comprehend He rejects them likewise in virtue of a Postulatum which I venture to call rejecting them without ceremony And though he inferreth a conclusion accurately true yet he doth it contrary to the rules of Logic from inaccurate  and false premises And how this comes about I have at large explained in the Analyst and shewed in that particular case of Tangents that the Rejectaneous Quantity might have been a finite quantity of any given magnitude and yet the conclusion have come out exactly the same way and consequently that the truth of this method doth not depend on the reason assigned by the Marquis to wit the  postulatum  for throwing away Infinitesimals and therefore that he and his followers acted blindfold as not knowing the true reason for the conclusion's coming out accurately right which I shew to have been the effect of a double error  XLI THIS is the truth of the matter which you shamefully misrepresent and declaim upon to no sort of purpose but to amuse and mislead your Reader For which conduct of yours throughout your remarks you will pardon me if I cannot otherwise account than from a secret hope that the reader of your defence would never read the Analyst If he doth He cannot but see what an admirable Method you take to defend your cause How instead of justifying the Reasoning the Logic or the Theory of the case specified  which is the real point you discourse of sensible and practical errors And how all this is a manifest imposition upon the Reader He must needs see that I have expresly said "I have no controversy except only about your Logic and method that I consider how you demonstrate what objects you are conversant about and whether you conceive them clearly That I have often expressed my self to the same effect desiring the Reader to remember that I am only concerned about the way of coming at your theorems whether it be legitimate or illegitimate clear or obscure scientific or tentative That I have on this very occasion to prevent all possibility of mistake repeated and insisted that I consider the Geometrical Analyst as a Logician  i e  so far forth as he reasons and argues and his mathematical conclusions not in themselves but in their premises not as true or false useful or insignificant but as derived from such principles and by such inferences"  Analyst  Sect XX  You affirm and indeed what can you not affirm that the difference between the true subtangent and that found without any compensation is absolutely nothing at all I profess my self of a contrary opinion  My reason is because nothing cannot be divided into parts But this difference is capable of being divided into any or into more than any given number of parts For the truth of which consult the Marquit  de l' Hospital  And be the error in fact or in practice ever so small it will not thence follow that the error in Reasoning which is what I am alone concerned about is one whit the less it being evident that a man may reason most absurdly about the minutest things  XLII PRAY answer me fairly once for all whether it be your opinion that whatsoever is little and inconsiderable enough to be rejected without inconvenience in practice the same may in like manner be safely rejected and overlooked in Theory and Demonstration If you say  no  it will then follow that all you have been saying here and elsewhere about yards and inches and decimal fractions setting forth and insisting on the extreme smallness of the rejectaneous quantity is quite foreign to the argument and only a piece of skill to impose upon your Reader If you say  yes  it follows that you then give up at once all the orders of Fluxions and Infinitesimal Differences and so most imprudently turn all your sallies and attacks  and Veterans to your own overthrow If the Reader is of my mind he will despair of ever seeing you get clear of this Dilemma The points in controversy have been so often and so distinctly noted in the Analyst that I very much wonder how you could mistake if you had no mind to mistake It is very plain if you are in earnest that you neither understand me nor your Masters And what shall we think of other ordinary Analysts when it shall be found that even you who like a Champion step forth to defend their principles have not considered them  XLIII THE impartial Reader is intreated to remark throughout your whole performance how confident you are in asserting and withall how modest in proving or explaining How frequent it is with you to employ Figures and Tropes instead of Reasons How many difficulties proposed in the Analyst are discreetly overlooked by you and what strange work you make with the rest How grosly you mistake and misrepresent and how little you practise the advice which you so liberally bestow Believe me Sir I had long and maturely considered the principles of the modern Analysis before I ventured to publish my thoughts thereupon in the  Analyst And since the publication thereof I have my self freely conversed with Mathematicians of all ranks and some of the ablest Professors as well as made it my business to be informed of the Opinions of others being very desirous to hear what could be said towards clearing my difficulties or answering my objections But though you are not afraid or ashamed to represent the Analysts as very clear and uniform in their Conception of these matters yet I do solemnly affirm and several of themselves know it to be true that I found no harmony or agreement among them but the reverse thereof the greatest dissonance and even contrariety of Opinions employed to explain what after all seemed inexplicable  XLIV SOME fly to proportions between nothings Some reject quantities because infinitesimal Others allow only finite quantities and reject them because inconsiderable Others place the method of Fluxions on a foot with that of  Exhaustions  and admit nothing new therein Some maintain the clear conception of Fluxions Others hold they can demonstrate about things incomprehensible Some would prove the Algorism of Fluxions by  reductio ad absurdum  others  a priori  Some hold the evanescent increments to be real quantities some to be nothings some to be limits As many Men so many minds Each differing one from another and all from Sir  Isaac Newton  Some plead inaccurate expressions in the great Author whereby they would draw him to speak their sense not considering that if he meant as they do he could not want words to express his meaning Others are magisterial and positive say they are satisfied and that is all not considering that we who deny Sir  Isaac Newton  's Authority shall not submit to that of his Disciples Some insist that the Conclusions are true and therefore the principles not considering what hath been largely said in the Analyst  Sect  XIX XX c  on that head Lastly several and those none of the meanest frankly owned the objections to be unanswerable All which I mention by way of Antidote to your false Colours and that the unprejudiced Inquirer after Truth may see it is not without foundation that I call on the celebrated Mathematicians of the present Age to clear up these obscure Analytics and concur in giving to the publick some consistent and intelligible account of the principles of their great Master which if they do not  I believe the World will take it for granted that they cannot  XLV HAVING gone through your Defence of the British Mathematicians I find in the next place that you attack me on a point of Metaphysics with what success the Reader will determine I had upon another Occasion many years ago wrote against Abstract general Ideas  Introduction to a Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge printed in the Year MDCCX  In opposition to which you declare your self to adhere to the vulgar opinion that neither Geometry nor any other general Science can subsist without general Ideas  P  This implies that I hold there are no general Ideas But I hold the direct contrary that there are indeed general Ideas but not formed by abstraction in the manner set forth by Mr  Locke  To me it is plain there is no consistent Idea the likeness whereof may not really exist Whatsoever therefore is said to be somewhat which cannot exist the Idea thereof must be inconsistent Mr  Locke  acknowledgeth it doth require Pains and Skill to form his general Idea of a Triangle He further expresly saith it must be neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none  of these at once He also saith it is an Idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent Ideas are put together  Essay on Humane Understanding  b iv c vii § ix  All this looks very like a Contradiction But to put the Matter past dispute it must be noted that he affirms it to be somewhat imperfect that cannot exist consequently the Idea thereof is impossible or inconsistent  XLVI I DESIRE to know whether it is not possible for any thing to exist which doth not include a contradiction And if it is whether we may not infer that what cannot possibly exist the same doth include a contradiction I further desire to know whether the reader can frame a distinct idea of any thing that includes a contradiction For my part I cannot nor consequently of the abovementioned Triangle Though you who it seems know better than my self what I can do are pleased to assure me of the contrary Again I ask whether that which it is above the power of man to form a compleat idea of may not be called incomprehensible And whether the Reader can frame a compleat idea of this imperfect impossible Triangle And if not whether it doth not follow that it  is incomprehensible It should seem that a distinct aggregate of a few consistent parts was nothing so difficult to conceive or impossible to exist and that therefore your Comment must be wide of the Author's meaning You give me to understand  P  that this account of a general Triangle was a trap which Mr  Locke  set to catch fools Who is caught therein let the Reader judge  XLVII IT is Mr  Locke  's opinion that every general name stands for a general abstract idea which prescinds from the species or individuals comprehended under it Thus for example according to him the general name  Colour  stands for an idea which is neither Blue Red Green nor any other particular colour but somewhat distinct and abstracted from them all To me it seems the word  Colour  is only a more general name applicable to all and each of the particular colours while the other specific names as Blue Red Green and the like are each restrained to a more limited signification The same may be said of the word Triangle Let the Reader judge whether this be not the case and whether he can distinctly frame such an idea of colour as shall prescind from all the species thereof  or of a triangle which shall answer Mr  Locke  's account prescinding and abstracting from all the particular sorts of triangles in the manner aforesaid  XLVIII I intreat my Reader to think For if he doth not he may be under some influence from your confident and positive way of talking But any one who thinks may if I mistake not plainly perceive that you are deluded as it often happens by mistaking the terms for ideas Nothing is easier than to define in terms or words that which is incomprehensible in idea forasmuch as any words can be either separated or joined as you please but ideas always cannot It is as easy to say a round square as an oblong square though the former be inconceivable If the Reader will but take a little care to distinguish between the Definition and the Idea between words or expressions and the conceptions of the mind he will judge of the truth of what I now advance and clearly perceive how far you are mistaken in attempting to illustrate Mr  Locke  's Doctrine and where your mistake lies Or if the Reader is minded to make short work he needs only at once to try whether laying aside the words he can frame in his mind the idea of an impossible triangle upon which trial the issue of  this dispute may be fairly put This doctrine of abstract general ideas seemed to me a capital error productive of numberless difficulties and disputes that runs not only throughout Mr  Locke  's book but through most parts of Learning Consequently my animadversions thereupon were not an effect of being inclined to carp or cavil at a single passage as you would wrongfully insinuate but proceeded from a love of Truth and a desire to banish so far as in me lay false principles and wrong ways of thinking without respect of persons And indeed though you and other Partymen are violently attached to your respective Masters yet I who profess my self only attached to Truth see no reason why I may not as freely animadvert on Mr  Locke  or Sit  Isaac Newton  as they would on  Aristole  or  Descartes  Certainly the more extensive the influence of any Error and the greater the authority which supports it the more it deserves to be considered and detected by sincere Inquirers after Knowledge  XLIX IN the close of your performance you let me understand that your Zeal for Truth and the reputation of your Masters hath occasioned your reprehending me with the utmost freedom And it must  be owned you have shewn a singular talent therein But I am comforted under the severity of your reprehensions when I consider the weakness of your arguments which were they as strong as your reproofs could leave no doubt in the mind of the Reader concerning the matters in dispute between us As it is I leave him to reflect and examine by your light how clearly he is enabled to conceive a fluxion or the fluxion of a fluxion a part infinitely small subdivided into an infinity of parts a nascent or evanescent increment that which is neither something nor nothing a triangle formed in a point velocity without motion and the rest of those  arcana  of the modern Analysis To conclude I had some thoughts of advising you how to conduct your self for the future in return for the advice you have so freely imparted to me but as you think it becomes me rather to inform my self than instruct others I shall for my further information take leave to propose a few Queries to those learned Gentlemen of  Cambridge  whom you associate with your self and represent as being equally surprised at the tendency of my Analyst  L I desire to know whether those who can neither demonstrate nor conceive  the principles of the modern Analysis and yet give into it may not be justly said to have Faith and be styled believers of mysteries Whether it is impossible to find among the Physicians mechanical Philosophers Mathematicians and Philomathematicians of the present age some such Believers who yet deride Christians for their belief of Mysteries Whether with such men it is not a fair reasonable and legitimate method to use the  Argumentum ad Hominem  And being so whether it ought to surprise either Christians or Scholars Whether in an age wherein so many pretenders to science attack the Christian Religion we may not be allowed to make reprisals in order to shew that the Irreligion of those men is not to be presumed an effect of deep and just thinking Whether an attempt to detect false reasonings and remedy defects in Mathematics ought to be ill received by Mathematicians Whether the introducing more easy methods and more intelligible principles in any science should be discountenanced Whether there may not be fair objections as well as cavils And whether to inquire diligently into the meaning of terms and the proof of propositions not excepting against any thing without assigning a reason nor affecting to mistake  the signification of words or stick at an expression where the sense was clear but considering the subject in all lights sincerely endeavouring to find out any sense or meaning whatsoever candidly setting forth what seems obscure and what fallacious and calling upon those who profess the knowledge of such matters to explain them whether I say such a proceeding can be justly called cavilling Whether there be an  ipse dixit  erected And if so when where by whom and upon what Authority Whether even where Authority was to take place one might not hope the Mathematics at least would be excepted Whether the chief end in making Mathematics so considerable a part of Academical Education be not to form in the minds of young Students habits of just and exact Reasoning And whether the study of abstruse and subtile matters can conduce to this end unless they are well understood examined and sifted to the bottom Whether therefore the bringing Geometrical demonstrations to the severest test of Reason should be reckoned a discouragement to the studies of any learned Society Whether to separate the clear parts of things from the obscure to distinguish the real Principles whereon Truths rest and  whence they are derived and to proportion the just measures of assent according to the various degrees of evidence be an useless or unworthy Undertaking Whether the making more of an argument than it will bear and placing it in an undue rank of evidence be not the likely way to disparage it Whether it may not be of some use to provoke and stir up the learned professors to explain a part of Mathematical Learning which is acknowledged to be most profound difficult and obscure and at the same time set forth by  Philalethes  and many others as the greatest instance that has ever been given of the extent of humane abilities Whether for the sake of a Great man's discoveries we must adopt his errors Lastly whether in an age wherein all other principles are canvassed with the utmost freedom the principles of Fluxions are to be alone excepted  AN APPENDIX CONCERNING Mr WALTON's VINDICATION Of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Principles of FLUXIONS  I _I HAD no sooner considered the performance of  Philalethes  but Mr  Walton  's Vindication of Fluxions was put into my hands As this  Dublin  Professor gleans after the  Cantabrigian  only endeavouring to translate a few passages from Sir  Isaac Newton  's  Principia  and enlarge on a hint or two of  Philalethes    he deserves no particular notice It may suffice to advertise the Reader that the foregoing Defence contains a full and explicite Answer to Mr  Walton  as he will find if he thinks it worth his pains to read what this Gentleman hath written and compare it therewith Particularly with Sect It is not I am sure worth mine to repeat the same things or confute the same notions twice over in mere regard to a writer who hath copied even the manners of  Philalethes  and whom in answering the other I have if I am not much mistaken sufficiently answered  II MR  Walton  touches on the same points that the other had touched upon before him He pursues a hint which the other had given  Philalethes  p  about Sir  Isaac  's first Section concerning  Rationes primae ultimae  He discreetly avoids like the other to say one syllable of second third or fourth Fluxions and of divers other points mentioned in the Analyst about all which I observe in him a most prudent and profound silence And yet he very modestly gives his Reader to understand that he is able to clear up all difficulties and objections that have ever been made  P  Mr  Walton  in  the beginning like  Philalethes  from a particular case makes a general in erence supposing that Infidelity to be imputed to Mathematicians in general which I suppose only in the person to whom the Analyst was addressed and certain other persons of the same mind with him Whether this extraordinary way of reasoning be the cause or effect of his passion I know not But before I had got to the end of his Vindication I ceased to be surprized at his Logic and his temper in the beginning The double error which in the Analyst was plainly meant to belong to others he with  Philalethes  whose very oversights he adopts supposeth to have been ascribed to Sir  Isaac Newton    P  And this writer also as well as the  Cantabrigian  must needs take upon him to explain the motive of my writing against Fluxions which he gives out with great assurance to have been because Sir  Isaac Newton  had presumed to interpose in Prophecies and Revelations and to decide in religions affairs  P  which is so far from being true that on the contrary I have a high value for those learned remains of that Great Man whose original and free Genius is an eternal reproach to that tribe of followers who are always imitating but never resemble him This specimen  of Mr  Walton  's truth will be a warning to the Reader to use his own eyes and in obscure points never to trust the Gentleman's Candour who dares to misrepresent the plainest  III I WAS thinking to have said no more concerning this Author's performance But lest he should imagine himself too much neglected I intreat the Reader to have the patience to peruse it and if he finds any one point of the doctrine of Fluxions cleared up or any one objection in the Analyst answered or so much as fairly stated let him then make his compliments to the Author But if he can no more make sense of what this Gentleman has written than I can he will need no answer to it Nothing is easier than for a man to translate or copy or compose a plausible discourse of some pages in technical terms whereby he shall make a shew of saying somewhat although neither the Reader nor himself understand one Title of it Whether this be the case of Mr  Walton  and whether he understands either Sir  Isaac Newton  or me or himself whatever I may think I shall not take upon me to say But one thing I know that many an unmeaning Speech passeth for significant by the mere assurance  of the Speaker till he cometh to be catechised upon it and then the truth sheweth it self This Vindicator indeed by his dissembling nine parts in ten of the difficulties proposed in the Analyst sheweth no inclination to be catechised by me But his Scholars have a right to be informed I therefore recommend it to them not to be imposed on by hard words and magisterial assertions but carefully to pry into his sense and sift his meaning and particularly to insist on a distinct answer to the following questions  IV LET them ask him whether he can conceive velocity without motion or motion without extension or extension without magnitude If he answers that he can let him teach them to do the same If he cannot let him be asked how he reconciles the idea of a Fluxion which he gives  P  with common sense Again let him be asked whether nothing be not the product of nothing multiplied by something And if so when the difference between the Gnomon and the sum of the rectangles  See Vindication p  vanisheth whether the rectangles themselves do not also vanish  i e  when  a b  is nothing whether  A b  +  B a  be not also nothing  i e  whether the momentum of  AB  be not nothing Let him then be asked what his momentums are good for when they are thus brought to nothing Again I wish he were asked to explain the difference between a magnitude infinitely small and a magnitude infinitely diminished If he saith there is no difference Then let him be further asked how he dares to explain the method of Fluxions by the  Ratio  of magnitudes infinitely diminished  P  when Sir  Isaac Newton  hath expressly excluded all consideration of quantities infinitely small  See the Introduction to his Quadratures  If this able Vindicator should say that quantities infinitely diminished are nothing at all and consequently that according to him the first and last  Ratio  's are proportions between nothings let him be desired to make sense of this or explain what he means by  proportion between nothings  If he should say the ultimate proportions are the  Ratio  's of mere limits then let him be asked how the limits of lines can be proportioned or divided After all who knows but this Gentleman who hath already complained of me for an uncommon way of treating Mathematics and Mathematicians  P  may as well as the  Cantabrigian  cry out  Spain  and the  Inquisition  when he finds himself thus closely pursued and beset with Interrogatories  That we may not therefore seem too hard on an innocent man who probably meant nothing but was betray'd by following another into difficulties and straits that he was not aware of I shall propose one single expedient by which his Disciples whom it most concerns may soon satisfy themselves whether this Vindicator really understands what he takes upon him to vindicate It is in short that they would ask him to explain the second third or fourth Fluxions upon his Principles Be this the Touchstone of his Vindication If he can do it I shall own my self much mistaken If he cannot it will be evident that he was much mistaken in himself when he presumed to defend Fluxions without so much as knowing what they are So having put the merits of the cause on this issue I leave him to be tried by his Scholars  FINIS
