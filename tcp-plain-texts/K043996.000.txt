 REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAMYARD  ADDRESSED To the Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR the Worshipful the ALDERMEN and the COMMONCOUNCIL of the City of London  IN TWO PARTS  LONDON PRINTED BY G BIGG IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXI  TO THE Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR THE Worshipful the ALDERMEN AND THE COMMONCOUNCIL of the City of London  MY LORD AND GENTLEMEN  BEFORE the Legislature had entirely assented to the late Bill in favour of the Encroachments near DurhamYard the two following little Tracts were drawn up with a view to prevent the Confirmation of that Injustice but as they were not finished time enough to be Communica∣ted with any hope of Success to those Per∣sons  for whose perusal they were at first in∣tended I think it my Duty in the next Place to address them to you as they parti∣cularly relate to the Rights and Property of the City of LondonWhen  Property  is taken away from the Ancient and Legal  Proprie∣tors  WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT and vested in other Persons  even private individuals  as their  own Property  for their  own private  ad∣vantage by Parliamentary Authority such a Precedent will render the  Property  of all Men as precarious as their  Party interest  and will enlarge the dangerous System of Pub∣lic Corruption by increasing the means of its baneful influenceBut this is not mere∣ly a Political evil it is also  immoral and ir∣religious  in every point of view To remove the Ancient Land Mark or Boundary is an  accursed Crime  according to the Laws of God compare Deut xix xxvii Job xxiv Proverbs xxii so that  every kind of wilful Encroachment  upon  the Property  of others is in some degree tainted with this heinous Guilt  Times are bad enough when such inva∣sions on Public or Private Property  remain unpunished  but the  moral State  of any Nation is even deplorable and their measure of ini∣quity may be said to be almost filled up when such notorious Acts of Injustice meet with  Public Encouragement  instead of  repre∣hension  and when Trespassers are  rewarded  and  gratified  to the Exclusion of the in∣jured Proprietor with a  Parliamentary Right  even in the very Object which tempted them to break the Laws and  wrong  their Neigh∣bours  Many well meaning People do not seem to be aware of the bad tendency of this exam∣ple and there is therefore the more neces∣sity that it should be pointed out and ex∣posed  The injustice appeared to me so notori∣ous after I had carefully considered the case that I should have been  inclined  as  a Citizen of the World  to represent the mon∣strous  immorality  of  rewarding  instead  of Pu∣nishing Trespassers  lest the evil example  should become epidemical and contagious in  the World  which is already too corrupt but  as a Citizen of London  it is even  my Duty  to do so in the present case for when I took the Oath of Allegiance to the King I was Sworn at the same time to  maintain the Franchises and Customs  of the City of London to the utmost of my power see the Oath of every Freeman  You shall swear that ye shall be good and true to our Sovereign Lord King George obeysant and obedient ye shall be to the Mayor and Ministers of this City  The Franchises and Customs thereof ye shall maintain and this City keep harmless in that that in you is c  and therefore as I hope I shall ever be faithful to the City of London as well as true to our most gra∣cious Sovereign I esteem it my indispensible Duty  to both  for the sake of  public Justice  to point out the  illegality  as it appears to me and dangerous tendency of  Publicly reward∣ing the Trespassers on the Rights of this Great City  with an  exclusive  Title to the very object of their temptation to Trespass  The  manner  of making these Encroach∣ments viz by throwing Rubbish into the Water without any Fence to retain it has been as hurtful to the River as the En∣croachments themselves without affording the least probability of any one good effect saving or convenience whatsoever to recommend it  a method  unfavourable to every purpose except the clandestine Designs of Trespassers that the intended Pro∣jection of their Encroachments may not sur∣prize and alarm the Public before the Mis∣chief is carried into Execution as for in∣stanceif the space which has lately been thus gradually stolen from the River near Durham Yard had been previously marked off with Piles for the Boundaries of a Wharf or with a Bank of large ChalkStones or other hard Materials not liable to be washed away as all Embankments on Navigable Rivers ought to be made the Trespass would have appeared much more enormous at first than by this method which rendered the  Progress of the growing Encroachments less notorious and alarming  Since these late Trespasses began the Bed of the River as I have been informed by several Watermen and others who have been well acquainted with the River for many Years is considerably increased in Height which is certainly occasioned in great measure by the  manner of Embanking  above described  But I am sorry my Lord and Gentlemen to observe that the City is as much to blame on this Account as the Encroachers for my fellow Citizens or some of them have suf∣fered themselves to be persuaded that this is the most eligible way of Embanking and they have therefore  adopted  or at least  do al∣low  the practice of this pernicious and  slovenly  Method in those Parts where the Embank∣ment is authorized so that the City seems to betray her own Cause as if she really intend∣ed by setting this  bad Example  to justify the like notorious Abuse near DurhamYard and thereby render the Progress and Iniquity of that growing Encroachment less conspicu∣ous  and remarkable It behoves the City to enquire how such an inconsistency began for this  rude slovenly  and  unmechanical Measure  could not have been adopted for the sake of saving  either Time or Expence  in the Work because it certainly requires a much greater Quantity of Rubbish than would have been really necessary to fill up the Space intended to be embanked And this to the manifest Detriment of the River for the lighter Particles of the Rubbish are constantly washed away from the Banks every Tide both up and down the Stream and must inevitably lodge at the Bottom of the River because the Current runs alternately both Ways And for the same Reason the boasted Scheme of  contracting the Avenue of the River  will not it is manifest prevent the gradual filling up of the Bed because the Rubbish and Filth that is washed away from the Banks at one Time of Tide is liable to be brought back again at another and so to be shifted backwards and forwards till the whole is gradually incorporated in a thick  heavy Loam at the Bottom of the River which at length becomes too firm to be af∣fected or removed by the Current and by this means the Bed will probably be so raised in process of time as to render the River to∣tally unfit for Navigation  It is therefore absolutely necessary my Lord and Gentlemen to put a Stop as soon as possible to this scandalous Practice viz of throwing Rubbish into the River without a Fence to retain it whether the Embank∣ments are allowed to Proceed or not but it is certainly more for the Interest of the City to  cut new Docks  and  Recesses  from the River and  to clear  and  deepen  the old ones than to  Embank  There are likewise some other Abuses to which the alarming Increase of the River's Bed is likewise in some Degree to be attri∣buted for besides many other lesser En∣croachments that are continually making on both Sides the River by enlarging the Banks with Rubbish driving Piles c I am in∣formed that Rubbish from Buildings Re∣fuse  from the Dyehouses c have some∣times been thrown out of Lighters into the River in the Night in order to save the trouble and expence of carrying the load farther awayI have been told this by se∣veral persons who have accidentally seen the like TrespassesIt is therefore become ne∣cessary for the future Preservation of this Noble River that the City should offer a proper Reward to all Watermen and others that shall give the first Information at Guild∣hall or the MansionHouse of any such En∣croachments or Misdemeanors in future The Reward should be paid when the Offender is convicted and might perhaps be defrayed out of the Fine for the Offence And the WaterBailiffs should likewise be rewarded in the same manner whenever they shall have been vigilant enough to give the first Notice of any Misdemeanor A proper Inquest of Citizens should be appointed out of each Ward by Rotation or else be impanneled by the Sheriffs as a Jury from time to time as there should be occasion to examine the  Complaints as soon as any Informations are received And the Assent or Leave of such an Inquest to any Encroachment driving of Piles c should not be allowed to autho∣rize the same or put a stop to further En∣quiry lest they should be in any Degree in∣fluenced by private Solicitation or be other∣wise tampered with which has sometimes been the Case on public Inquiries when Nuisances have been presented but the final Determination should rest as at present with the Court of Common Council and no WaterBailiff or other City Officer what∣ever should have Power to excuse or tolerate the driving any Piles or the least En∣croachment For when such a Power is vested in any  Officer  whose charge is of this nature it is apt to destroy the intended utility of his  Office  because the more Offences and Encroachments are committed the more Fees and Christmas Compliments he will probably receive and annually demand as the Price of Toleration and Forbearance The Office of Water Bailiff though it affords an ample  Proof of the ancient Jurisdiction and Right of the City of London to the River Thames yet has been hitherto in general I fear rather a means of authorizing Encroach∣ments than of preventing them  I do not mean to blame the Conduct of your Water Bailiff or of any other Officer in particular for Custom has so reconciled the giving of pecuniary Acknowledgments to the Water Bailiff for tolerating Encroach∣ments as I have been informed that the same are looked upon as the  lawful  and  just Dues  of his Office and he does not clan∣destinely demand them but openly and as it were by the authority of the City which receives of every such Officer at his appoint∣ment a very large sum of Money for the Purchase of his Office  in Consideration of these Emoluments  I say  in Consideration of these Emoluments  because the same must neces∣sarily  be supposed  to be known and under∣stood by  the Sellers  as well as  the Buyers  at the Time of the Purchase if the  proper  In∣come and Value of the Office be compared  with the enormous Price that has of late been given for it The  Profits  or  Salary  ought therefore to be made adequate in some other way otherwise  the City  and not  the WaterBailiff  must be blamed  I ought not however to blame  the City  without endeavouring at the same time to obviate the Objection which some Per∣sons have lately urged against her on the same Account viz  that by neg∣lecting to prevent Abuses and Encroach∣ments she has forfeited her  Right  of Conservancy  but as I have already shewn in the two little Tracts sent herewith that the City has  a natural  as well as  Legal Right  to her Jurisdiction on the River I need only add further that  the like Plea  of Forfeiture if it were once admitted would be equally effectual to deprive any Lord or Gentleman of his  Family Estate and Patri∣mony  for there are but few Men I fear who make so good a Use of their Possessions as they might and ought though there are very many that would PRETEND  to improve  and dispose of the same more advantageously for the  PUBLIC GOOD if  such a Plea  was sufficient to justify an Attempt  to dispossess the right Owner  But to returnI do not mean to blame the City  for selling  the Office of Water Bailiff but rather for not publishing before it is offered to sale proper Conditions Instruc∣tions and Injunctions to point out the Duties of the Office and for not giving notice that the same is liable to the Penalty of Forfeiture for Maladministration in order that the Pur∣chaser may thereby be enabled to regulate his Conduct agreeable to the  real Duty  of his Office and may know that he forfeits his Place if he wilfully tolerates  the least En∣croachment  Were this Method observed  the selling  of Places I mean Places  merely of Trust  that don't require great Learning and Science would be by far the most eligi∣ble way of disposal because Recommenda∣tions and great Interest are far from being  certain Proofs  of the most deserving Candi∣date whereas the Purchase Money would be a  certain  and  real Gain  as well as an  excellent  Security  for good Behaviour But without such Instructions and Conditions the  private Emolument  of the  Officer  is too liable to interfere with the  public Utility  of the  Office  whereas by the Method which I have already submitted to your Consideration  viz of offer∣ing Rewards for the first Discovery of Offen∣ces  every Waterman would find it his In∣terest to take upon himself the Office of a  diligent  and  inexorable WaterBailiff  because the proposed Reward arises from the  public Proof  instead of the  Concealment  and  Tolera∣tion  of Offences and there would be too many of these  voluntary Officers  to be bribed to secrecy  I am with great Respect My Lord and Gentlemen Your most obedient And most humble Servant GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  Aug  REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAMYARD PART I  PART I  Some Remarks on the Case of the City of London with respect to the Encroach∣ments on the River Thames near DurhamYard and the Bill now depending in Parliament  to establish the said Trespasses  IT cannot be denied notwithstanding all the delusive Sophistry that hath been used upon this occasion that the City of London hath ever enjoyed and exercised on the River Thames a Right of  Conservancy  as well of the  Width  or  Avenue  by occasionally inspecting and regulating the Boundaries  as of the  Fishery  with power and authority to remove all nuisances so that this Franchise or Liberty is absolutely vested in the City by  Prescription and Ancient Usage  besides many positive  Grants and Confirmations  And what Freeholder will be able to produce a more authentic Title to his Estate and Property For a long process of time and a long Use Possession or Custom which exceeds the Memory of Man  is sufficient to constitute a Right  or just Title  Longum Tempus et longus Usus qui excedit memoriam homi∣num  sufficit pro jure  Principia Legis et AEquitatis p See also Co Lit There is besides an express Article in Magna Charta to secure to the City of London  all her Ancient Liberties and Customs    Civitas Londini habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas et  consuetudines suas  Cap a∣mongst which undoubtedly this Right and Custom of  Conservancy  is to be reckoned as one of the  most material Franchises  because the  very existence  of this great Trading City depends upon it so that the City's Title to the Con∣servancy is founded on  a natural  as well as  legal Right  The pretended consent of the Col∣legiate Church of Westminster cannot palliate the Trespass or lessen the in∣jury to the City of London The Grant of King James on which the Claim of that Church is said to be founded could not convey  a power to embank and fill up the River  nor a Right  to confirm such a Trespass  when committed because the King himself had  no such power  and consequently  had  no right to Grant it  so that the Jurisdiction said to extend  infra finem aquoe to the middle of the Stream  must be construed in some other sense or it will otherwise render the  whole Grant null and void  because the River Thames is  a Public Avenue or Passage  to the City so that in this respect it is to be considered as the  King's high∣way and it  is esteemed the King's high∣way no otherwise than in Trust for the Public so that the King has no power to dispense with an  Encroachment on the highway  for though  he may par∣don Nusances that are transient and not continuing  Yet  a Nusance in the highway which still continues and is not ended until removed can∣not be pardoned  Judge Vaughan's Reports because  the same is to be esteemed evil and iniquitous in its very  nature a "Malum in se Bad in itself"  which is further proved by the same Learned Author in P  I may conclude says he those things to be  mala in se which can never be made lawful  He then cites the YearBook of Henry viz  But  Malum in se  the King nor any other can dispense  And instanceth  Si come Si le Roy voyloit pardon de occider un homme  ou de faire nusance in le haut chemin ceo est void  To wit if the King should be willing to pardon the Killing of a Man or rather as the next sentence explains it  will  GIVE POWER to  kill a Man  or to make  a Nuisance in the HighRoad the same is void  and upon the same reason says he a license to imprison a Man  to take his Land  his Horse or any  thing  that is his from him is void  For in  Life Liberty and Estate  every Man  who hath not forfeited them  hath a Property and Right which the Law allows him to defend and if it is violated it gives an Action to re∣dress the Wrong and to Punish the  Wrongdoer  Therefore a  Dispen∣sation  that is to make lawful the taking from a Man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken or lawfully punish if it be  must be void  For it is a contradic∣tion to make it  lawful  to take what may be  lawfully  hindered from be∣ing taken  or lawfully Punished  if it be And that were to make  two Men  have several  Plenary Rights in the same thing at the same time which  NO LAW CAN EFFECT  Therefore  TO DO  a thing which  NO LAW  can  make  LAWFUL  must be  MALUM IN SE  This Argument clearly proves the Impropriety of pretending a Right or Power in the Crown or in the Church of Westminster to give their consent for the establishment of the Trespass in the River at DurhamYard  The Right of Conservancy has been invested in the City of London from the most ancient Times so that the King cannot resume that Power if  he would  for it is a maxim in Law that a  quiet and uninterrupted  Possession for Years creates a just Title  Possessio pacifica pour Anns    facit Jus  See Judge Jenkins to the same effect Cent and the Kings Order Command or Letters Patent have  no legal Weight or Effect against such a Right for  rescriptum prin∣cipis contra jus non valet  On the other hand the Right of the Church of Westminster to the River even supposing that it had been law∣ful for King James the first to grant such  a Right  is nevertheless forfeited for want of being claimed and put in use since that time whereas the Right of the Citizens of London is sufficiently established according to the Maxims before cited by the exercise and en∣joyment of a continual and undisputed Jurisdiction upon the River as being their undoubted Right and Property  surely  for more than Years last past  And a Right or Property thus acquired  is as valid even against the  Pretensions of the Crown  as against those of the Church of Westminster or even  as  against those of a Private Man  for the  Nullum Tempus  Doctrine cannot justify the King's Claim to the  Soil  of the Thames because the Right of the Crown in Manors Lands Tene∣ments c is exactly upon the same footing  with respect  TO TIME  as Private Freeholds  For Bracton informs us that in all such things  currit tem∣pus contra Regem sicut contra quam libet privatam personam  Bracton de legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae d B c P I have thoroughly examined the Doctrine of  Nullum Tempus occurrit regi  in a little Tract expressly upon that Subject and there∣fore need not enlarge upon it here  Now as the City of London has ac∣quired so firm a Title to her Jurisdiction by a quiet Possession for Years ac∣cording  to the Maxim before quoted how unjust is it at this time to call her Right in Question when it  is noto∣rious  that the same may as easily be traced back more than  See the Charter of Richard st C d cited in the Royal Charter of Confirmation by Charles the d to the City of London p  We have clearly quit claimed all that which the Keepers of the Tower of London were wont Yearly to receive of the said Wares  Speak∣ing of Wares in the Thames to the Detriment of the City and this Charter is expressly said to have been given  for the Soul's Health of King Henry our Father and all our Ancestors Souls  probably meaning his Ancestors of the Norman Line who had unjustly usurped those Rights The Jurisdiction of the City of Lon∣don upon the River was soon after acknowledged also by his Brother King John See his Charter cited in the Posthumous Works of Sir H Spel∣man p  Et Civitas  Londinensis  habeat omnes  ANTIQUAS  libertates et liberas consuetudines suas tam per Terras quam  PER AQUAS  N B Even at that time they were esteemed "ANTIQUAS  Libertates  c  times Years For  ex diuturnitate temporis omnia praesumuntur Solenniter esse acta  We are taught also by the  unquestion∣able  Whosoever denies the force and weight of the  Maxims and Principles  of the Common Law is unworthy of Argument and deserves not to be treated as a reasonable Being for  Con∣tra Negantem principia non est disputandum  Co Lit  Maxims  of the Common Law that Men cannot be obliged to part with their  Right and Property  without their own free consent  Iniquum est ingenuis hominibus non esse Liberam re∣rum suarum alienationem  And  Rerum suarum quilibet est moderator et arbiter  And again  Regulariter non valet pactum de re mea non alie∣nanda  Co Lit For no Man may be compelled to sell what is his own even for the full value of it  Nemo cogitur rem suam vendere etiam justo pretio  Inst And again That which is  my own  cannot be taken from me  without my consent  Quod meum est a me sine me auferri non potest  Jenk Cent  There is indeed an Exception to these general Maxims and that is when the  Public Benefit  requires such an Alienation as for the making of Public Roads Canals  In all the Cases here mentioned it is neces∣sary that the  Alienated Private Property  should be vested  in the Public  or  in the Crown for the Public  and not as the  private Property of any Individuals whatsoever  notwithstanding that  the Public  may seem to be benefited by their  Private  Undertak∣ings Precedents of this kind have indeed been established by  some late Acts  for  Cutting Canals  but I flatter myself that the Legislature was not then aware of the impropriety of such examples The Proposal of the City of London for Cut∣ting a Canal from Isleworth upwards was a proper pattern for all other Undertakings of that nature because the Property was to be vested  in the Public  and it was intended finally to be made  a Free Navigation  so that of course it would have been considered  in Law  as  the King's High∣way  c  or Build∣ing  Fortifications for the Public safe∣ty In all such cases  Private Advan∣tage  must  give way to the Public Good "Privatum commodum Publico cedit"  and  "Privatum incommodum Publico Bono pensatur  Jenk Cent But when the  Public Property  vested in a Body Corporate in Trust for the  Pub∣lic Advantage  is clandestinely taken away BY ENCROACHMENT and an at∣tempt  is made to  establish the Trespass  and vest that  Public Property  in  Private Hands  for  Private Advantage without the Consent of the Ancient and Legal Trustees  it is to reverse the very fun∣damental Principles of  Natural Equity  and to turn the once firm Pyramid of the Law upon its Point instead of  its Basis  so as to threaten ruin and de∣struction to all things within the reach of its fall  The Pretence  that the  Public  will be  benefited  in proportion to the advantage arising to the  Trespassers  is frivolous and ought not by any means to be admitted It savours of  partiality  to view  a Public Benefit  through the medium of a  private Ad∣vantage  because the public  Utility  usually alledged in such cases proves times in  a mere pretence  and  no∣thing illegal ought to be admitted  even  though  the pretence  for it is Lawful  Pretextu liciti non debet admitti illi∣citum  Co There are also some other things alledged as rea∣sons for shewing favour to this Tres∣pass viz the Taste and Skill of the Architects and the Public Ornament of their Edifices  c  But all such  Pretences  are equally frivolous with the first when they interfere with  Public Right and Franchise  for the Law does not favour the Elegant and Sumptuous  Lex non favet delicato∣rum votis  Co  Yet the City paid a proper Atten∣tion it is manifest to the merit of the Architects and the Appearance of their Buildings by discovering an In∣clination which I have elsewhere mentioned more at large to allow  them sufficient room to make a conve∣nient Wharf that the Purposes of their noble Vaults might not be in∣jured but as more than this would be superfluous the Citizens could not have been justified had they not re∣jected the unconscionable request of the Trespassers especially as it was thought that the addition of a  large TimberYard  for the  private Use and Advantage  of the Builders would not accord∣ing to the Taste of the Citizens at least contribute much  to public Orna∣ment and Elegance  The other  pre∣tence  of  public Utility  was as little ap∣parent to the Citizens in general as this last for it is still  doubtful  and re∣mains to be proved as I have shewn in another Paper whereas there is NO DOUBT  of the illegality of the Trespass  for the same was notorious as well  with respect to the Encroachment it∣self as the manner of making it by throwing so many Thousand Cartloads of Rubbish into the River without a Fence to retain it which must cer∣tainly prejudice the River by lessening the DepthThis was an apparent  in∣jury  and  an Injury is contrary to Law  Tort a le ley est  contrary  Co Lit No Man ought to be enriched to the inconvenience or dis∣advantage of another  Nemo de∣bet locupletari ex alterius incommodo  Jenk Cent No Man ought to be allowed to receive benefit or take ad∣vantage from his own fraud or Tres∣pass  Nemo ex dolo suo proprio releve∣tur aut auxilium capiat  Jur Civ And shall the Parliament of England then endeavour to establish  a Wrong  to the total subversion of these indis∣putable  Precepts The Example is dangerous The Precedent threatens Ruin and Dissolution to all the legal ties of Security for the quiet Possession of Lands and Inheritances in this KingdomFor if we depart from the Law there can be no Security to any Man in any thing but all things will be rendered uncertain and precarious  Si a jure discedas vagus eris et erunt omnia omnibus incerta  Co Lit The Public Good requires that bad Actions should not remain unpunished  Interest Reipublicae ne maleficia rema∣neant impunita  Jenk Cent p for when a Judge and much more the whole Legislature favours an unwor∣thy Man does it not encourage all Men to fall away from their integrity and does it not promote an universal contagion as it were of a  Licencious∣ness  Cum indulget Judex indigno nonne ad Prolapsionis contagium pro∣vocat universos  Fleta Cap S Because the  Admission of one Absurdity or Injustice  makes way for Ten Thousand more  Uno absurdo dato infinita sequuntur  Co and those Crimes and Trespasses which are often excused and defended will surely be often committed  Videbis ea saepe committi quae saepe vindican∣tur  Inst Epilogue  If all these Points are carefully con∣sidered the Bill must manifestly ap∣pear  inconsistent with the Spirit and Principles of the Common Law  Nay it is so notoriously unjust that it af∣fords us some comfort even by the excess of its Illegality  For I have already shewn it to be a  "malum per se"  and contrary to  na∣tural Right  and therefore I trust that it will be  null and void  of itself even if it should gain the Assent of all the Three Branches of the Legislature for no Law can establish what Nature or natural Right prohibits  Quae rerum natura prohibentur nulla lege confirmata sunt  Finch and whatsoever  is done contrary to Law  may be esteemed as  undone a mere nul∣lity  Quod contra legem fit  pro in∣fecto  habetur  Co But above all let it be remembered that the  Old Liberties and Customs of the City of London  amongst which the Conservancy of the River Thames Medway and Lee is perhaps the most essential to her Welfare and very Ex∣istence  are secured to her by an Ex∣press Article of Magna Charta  Chap which I have already remarked in the beginning of this little Tract and therefore it behoves the Learned in the Law to demonstrate that this Bill is not  in any Point  derogatory to the said th Chapter of Magna Charta but if this cannot be done the joint Authority of King Lords and Com∣mons is not sufficient to pass it into a Law  I mean a Valid and Constitu∣tional Law  such as can be maintained  without Corruption and Arbitrary Power  because it  is "Assented and accorded"  by an Act of the d Year of King Edward III Chap which is still in force and must ever remain so  that  the Great Charter  and Charter of the Forrest be holden and kept  in all Points  and if any Statute be made  to the contrary  that shall  be holden for NONE  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  th May  REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAMYARD PART II  PART II  Some further Remarks concerning the Injury done to the City of London by the Encroachments on the River Thames near DurhamYard  THE extraordinary Favour shewn in Parliament to the Trespasses lately committed by several Persons in the enormous Encroachment on the River Thames near DurhamYard is liable to affect the Security of Property in general because an Encouragement to commit Trespasses and a Precedent to establish and confirm the same when committed do certainly tend to the  Total Subversion of Justice for in every point of view the same are repugnant to the fundamental Principles of Law and Equity  Actions were commenced in the Court of King's Bench against the En∣croachments  before  the Trespassers brought their Bill into Parliament so that the Concurrence of Parliament with the Authors of the Injury  is a gross insult upon the Laws  by stopping the regular Course of Justice in  a mat∣ter of Right  which came properly be∣fore the King's Courts for as it is esteemed unjust to punish a Man by the force of an  ex post facto  Law it certainly is equally unjust by an  ex post facto  Law to confirm and establish a  manifest Trespass  which was previ∣ously referred to a proper Court for  Redress and the Application to Par∣liament is of itself a sufficient Proof that the Right and Claim of the City of London  are just  and such as must necessarily have found  a Remedy in Law  according to the usual Proceedings of the King's Courts otherwise the  ex post facto Law  had been needless  It ought to be remembered also that the City of London for the sake of Peace and to avoid a Contest in Parliament was  inclined  to allow some of the Trespassers who are eminent Builders as much ground in the Front of their Buildings as would be suffi∣cient to make a Wharf wide enough for Carts to come down and to turn and load c as at other Quays in the City so that the use and intention of the noble underground Passages might  not be lost or in the least injured and a private intimation of this Lenity and Favour to which the City seemed disposed was given to a Friend of the Builders that they might be advised to Petition the City for Room to make such a Wharf and they were told that the same would  probably  be granted in consideration of their great Expences and the Grandeur of their Buildings  But instead of  such a Petition  the Builders presented a  Memorial  they did not deign to call it  a Petition  desiring more than or Times as much room as was necessary for the said purpose because it seems a Wharf alone would not content them but  as Builders  they must be indulged also with room enough out of the Width of the Ri∣ver to make likewise for  a Public  Ornament  I suppose  even a Timber Yard besides  They did not indeed men∣tion  the Timber Yard  in their Memorial but the design plainly appears by a Clause in the Bill to regulate  the Height of the Piles of Timber  c  They did not fail however  to demand  of the City as much Space as they thought necessary for  their intended Tim∣ber Yard  and they were pleased at the same time to desire  the Concurrence of the City as Conservators of the River to their Petition in Parliament  An Insult this to the Citizens of London  as gross and enormous as the Encroachment itself  for in effect it was to desire the Citizens to join in a Petition to Parlia∣ment  against themselves  that is in Fa∣vour of and to establish and confirm a notorious Trespass committed in De∣fiance  of their own repeated Prohibi∣tions and Presentments  The Memorial however was rejected with a proper Disdain But this was no hindrance to the Adventurers they were already  sufficiently aware  that they might affront the City with ImpunityThey knew their  Party  Interest in Parliament and  the Partiality  has hitherto been  proved by the Success  Two great Law Lords strenuously en∣deavoured to palliate the Offence and to set forth the Public Utility of the Em∣bankment One of them admitted that  the present Scheme was intended for the private Emolument of Mess A∣dams but then said he that Emolu∣ment could only increase in Proportion to the Convenience and Public Uti∣lity  of the Embankment if it was found inconvenient the intended use would be lost consequently their Profit would go with it it was therefore in every point a great Public Good arising from a Private Advantage  However plausible this Argument may seem yet I must ob∣serve that it ill becomes any Gentle∣man at the head of the Law to view  a Public Good  through the medium  of a Private Advantage  especially as that  private advantage  had been sought by  a manifest Public Injury and Trespass  for when the Encroachment first be∣gan the Right of the City of London was so far from being disputed that the Trespassers themselves acknow∣ledged it by Petitioning for Leave and though they could not obtain Leave from those who had a Right to  give it yet they continued to  enlarge  their enormous Trespass as confident∣ly as if the whole River was indispu∣tably their own But even if the ima∣ginary  Public Good  supposed by the learned Chief Justice be admitted yet his Lordship knows that  That which is otherwise Good and Just in itself becomes Wicked and Unjust if it is sought or obtained by Force or Fraud  Quod alias bonum justum est si per vim vel fraudem petatur malum et injustum efficitur  C and his Lordship will not I appre∣hend deny that  an enormous Trespass  has been committed and therefore those that are robbed and injured ought  before all things to be reinstated  and have their Rights restored  Spo∣liatus debet  ante omnia restitui  Iust Law Justice and Equity  cannot shew the least favour or consi∣deration for the Delinquents in such a Case because  "Iniquity Bars Equity"  and  no Man can take advantage from his own Trespass or Injury  Nullus commodum capere potest de in∣juria sua propria  Co Lit  The Public Good requires that bad Actions should not remain un∣punished  Interest Reipublicae ne ma∣leficia remaneant impunita  Jenk Cent p  But if on the contrary the Legisla∣ture will favour and confirm an appa∣rent Trespass no Man's Property can be safe from such Adventurers If I had  as much Party Interest  and paid as little  regard to the difference between  MEUM  and  TUUM as they have done  in the present Case  or their Advocates  I would procure an elegant Plan for raising such a Building as should not only be a Public Ornament in its struc∣ture but a Public Convenience in its Accommodations within and without in short I would build a noble Inn open  to all Men for  MY OWN  and the public advantage  upon the Inheritance of Lord A Lord B or of any other Noble Freeholder whatsoever whose Property in point of Situation might seem to promise the most advantage to my undertaking  Or a good Plan for raising an Elegant  and outwardly  Ornamental Edifice  inwardly  adapted to the purposes of  Grinding Corn Slitting Iron making Gunpowder  or any other Articles necessary for the suste∣nance  convenience or protection of  the Public  would equally answer my  private Advantage  and  a good Mill  would be  a good Inheritance  let me tell you if I could make it  my own Freehold  wherever I pleased to Build one  with or without  the Consent of the Lord of the Manor or the lawful Proprietor of the Ground  The same Doctrine may be extended even to the Building of  whole Towns upon other Mens Ground without Leave  because the Towns would be for the ac∣commodation of Gentlemen of Trades∣men of Manufacturers Artificers  c c c  whereby  the Public  would manifestly be benefited as well as  the Builder in proportion  to the Success of each Undertaking in the Increase of Inhabitants  If the lawful Proprietor of the Ground on which  I trespassed  would be pleased to give me his Consent it would be well and if he refused it  my Pretensions would still be as good as the much favoured Cause of the Trespassers at DurhamYord  for even though I should be obliged to allow that my present Scheme  was intended for the Private Emolument  of  myselfyet I could alledge the Opinion of a Chief Justice that  this Emolument could only increase in proportion to the Con∣venience and Public Utility of  my Inn my Mill or my Town  If it was found inconvenient the intended Use would be lost consequently  " my  Profit would go with it it would therefore  according to this Opinion of my Lord Chief Justice  be in  every point a great  PUBLIC GOOD  ari∣sing from a  PRIVATE ADVANTAGE  I might alledge also that this  pri∣vate Advantage  of mine ought to be much more favoured than that of the Encroachers on the River Thames because if I should raise my Prices for Provisions for Grinding for Rent  c  upon the Public there would still be Room sufficient in the Neighbour∣hood  as the Consent of Proprietors  is  at present esteemed unnecessary  for other People also to  Trespass  and Build more Inns more Mills or more Towns  for  THEIR OWN  and the Public Advantage  as near to my advantageous Situation as they should think proper so that the Public when  imposed upon by me  might be enabled to give the pre∣serence to cheaper and less uncon∣scionable Trespassers  But in the other Case the local Ad∣vantages are more limited and confined to a particular Situation and the  En∣croachments are already so great  that there is scarcely Room for more within any advantageous Distance be∣cause the Advantage of Situation  for Wharfs  is confined within the extent of the Trading Part of the Town now fully occupied  and the Port or Bason of the River  within these Bounds is already too much contracted to admit of  more Encroachments  without encum∣bering or stopping up  the Passage of the River  with Craft and Vessels which even at present are greatly endangered for want of commodious and proper MooringPlaces out of the Stream and TidewayDuring the Frosty Wea∣ther this last Winter or Ships were wrecked and many others damaged  even in the Port of London  for want of such proper Accommodations and a very considerable number of Barges Lighters c were forced away from their Moorings by the Ice and lost both above and below London Bridge so that it is manifest that  Waterroom  is of much more consequence to the Port of London than any Land gained from it can possibly be and that there cannot therefore be any Room to spare for making more Wharfs out of the Bed of the River without  an ap∣parent Injury to the Harbour  so that if the new Wharfs should become ab∣solutely necessary by an Increase of Trade  the Public Utility  must submit to the Exactions of the  Private Posses∣sor  whose Tenure is founded in  Pub∣lic Injury and Injustice  and the Trade of this great City on which its  very  Existence depends  must be Loaded and Clogged with  the much favoured Pri∣vate Advantage  of  each Trespasser  so that we may fairly measure by the Enormity of the present Encroach∣ments  how conscientiously Trespassers in general  would deign to consider the Trade and Rights of  the Public  when their own  Private Interest  is in View  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old
