 AN APPENDIX TO JOHN BULL Still In His SENSES OR  Law is a BottomlessPit  Printed from a Manuscript found in the Cabinet of the famous Sir  Humphry Polesworth  And Publish'd as well as the three former Parts by the Author of the NEW ATALANTIS  LONDON  Printed for  John Morphew  ne  r  Stationer'sHall  Price  d  AN APPENDIX TO John Bull Still in his Senses c  CHAP I  The Apprehending Examination and Imprisonment of Jack for Suspicion of Poisoning  THE attentive Reader cannot have forgot that in my last Part the Story of  Yan Ptschirnsooker  's Powder was interrupted by a Message from  Frog  I have a natural Compassion for Curiosity being much troubled with the Distemper my self therefore to gratify that uneasy itching Sensation in my Reader I have procur'd the following Account of that Matter  Yan Ptschirnsooker  came off as Rogues usually do upon such Occasions by Peaching  his Partner and being extremely forward to bring him to the Gallows  Jack  was accus'd▪ as the Contriver of all the Roguery And indeed it happen'd unfortunately for the poor Fellow that he was known to bear a most inveterate Spight against the old Gentlewoman and consequently that never any ill Accident happen'd to her but he was suspected to be at the bottom of it If she prick'd her Finger  Jack  to be sure laid the Pin in the way If some Noise in the Street disturb'd her Rest who could it be but  Jack  in some of his nocturnal Rambles If a Servant run away  Jack  had debauch'd him every idle Tittletattle that went about  Jack  was always suspected for the Author of it However all was nothing to this last Affair of the temperating moderating Powder The Hue and Cry went after  Jack  to Apprehend him dead or alive wherever he could be found The Constables look'd out for him in all his usual Haunts but to no purpose Where d'ye think did they find him at last Ev'n smoaking his Pipe very quietly at his Brother  Martin  's from whence he was carry'd with a vast Mob at his Heels before the Worshipful Mr Justice  Overdo  Several of his Neighbours made Oath That of late the Prisoner had been observ'd to lead a very dissolute Life renouncing ev'n his usual Hypocrisy and Pretences to Sobriety That he frequented Taverns and EatingHouses  and had been often guilty of Drunkenness and Gluttony at My LordMayor's Table That he had been seen in the Company of Lewd Women That he had transferr'd his usual religious Care of the engross'd Copy of his Father's Will to Bank Bills Orders for Tallies and Debentures  Tale of the Tub  These he now affirm'd with more literal Truth to be  Meat Drink and Cloth the Philosophers Stone and the Ʋniversal Medicine  That he was so far from shewing his customary Reverence to the  Will  that he kept company with those that call'd his Father a cheating Rogue and his  Will  a Forgery That he not only sat quietly and heard his Father rail'd at but often chim'd in with the Discourse and hugg'd the Authors as his Bosom Friends  Tale of the Tub  That instead of asking for Blows at the Corners of the Streets  he now bestow'd them as plentifully as he begg'd them before In short That he was grown a meer Rake and had nothing left in him of old  Jack  except his Spight to  John Bull  's Mother  Another Witness made Oath That  Jack  had been overheard bragging of a Trick he had found out to manage the  old formal Jade  as he us'd to call her  Damn this numb'dSkull of mine quoth he that I could not light on it sooner As long as I go in this ragged tatter'd Coat I am so well known  that I am hunted away from the old Woman's Door by every barking Curr about the House they bid me Defiance there's no doing Mischief as an open Enemy I must find some way or another of getting within Doors and then I shall have better Opportunities of playing my Pranks besides the Benefit of good keeping  Two Witnesses Swore that several Years ago there came to their Mistriss's Door a young Fellow in a tatter'd Coat that went by the Name of  Timothy Trim  whom they did in their Conscience believe to be the very Prisoner resembling him in Shape Stature and the Features of his Countenance that the said  Timothy Trim  being taken into the Family clap'd their Mistriss's Livery over his own tatter'd Coat that the said  Timothy  was extremely officious about their Mistriss's Person endeavouring by Flattery and Talebearing to set her against the rest of the Servants no Body was so ready to fetch any thing that was wanted or reach what was drop'd that he us'd to shove and elbow his FellowServants to get near his Mistress especially when Mony was a paying or receiving then he was never out of the way that he was extremely diligent about every Bodies Business but his own that the said  Timothy  while he was in the Family us'd to be playing Roguish Tricks when his Mistress's back was turn'd he would  loll out his Tongue make Mouths and laugh at her walking behind her like a  Harlequin  ridiculing her Motions and Gestures if his Mistress look'd about he put on a grave demure Countenance as he had been in a fit of Devotion that he us'd often to trip up Stairs so smoothly that you could not hear him tread and put all things out of Order that he would pinch the Children and Servants when he met them in the dark so hard that he left the Print of his Forefingers and his Thumb in black and blue and then slink into a corner as if no Body had done it Out of the same malicious Design he us'd to lay Chairs and Jointstools in their way that they might break their Noses by falling over them The more young and unexperienc'd he us'd to teach to talk Saucily and call Names During his stay in the Family there was much Plate missing that being catch'd with a couple of Silver Spoons in his Pocket with their Handles wrench'd off he said he was only going to carry them to the Goldsmiths to be mended that the said  Timothy  was hated by all the honest Servants for his illcondition'd splenetick Tricks but especially for his slanderous Tongue traducing them to their Mistress as Drunkards Thieves and Whoremasters that the said  Timothy  by lying Stories us'd to set all the Family together by the Ears taking delight to make them Fight and Quarrel particularly one Day  sitting at Table he spoke Words to this Effect  I am of Opinion  quoth he  That little short Fellows such as we are have better Hearts and could beat the tall Fellows I wish it came to a fair Trial I believe these long Fellows as sightly as they are should find their Jackets well thwack'd  A parcel of tall Fellows who thought themselves affronted by this Discourse took up the Quarel and to't they went the tall Men and the low Men which continues still a Faction in the Family to the great Disorder of our Mistress's Affairs That the said  Timothy  carried this Frolick so far that he propos'd to his Mistress that she should entertain no Servant that was above four Foot seven Inches high and for that Purpose had prepar'd a Gage by which they were to be measur'd That the good old Gentlewoman was not so simple as to go into his Projects she began to smell a Rat  This  Trim  quoth she is an odd sort of a Fellow methinks he makes a strange Figure with that ragged tatter'd Coar appearing under his Livery can't he go spruce and clean like the rest of the Servants The Fellow has a Roguish Leer with him which I don't like by any means besides he has such a twang in his Discourse and an ungraceful way of speaking through the Nose that one can hardly understand him I wish the Fellow be not Tainted with some bad Disease  The Witnesses  farther made Oath That the said  Timothy  lay out a Nights and went abroad often at unseasonable Hours that it was credibly reported he did Business in another Family that he pretended to have a squeamish Stomach and could not eat at Table with the rest of the Servants tho' this was but a pretence to provide some nice Bit for himself that he refus'd to Dine upon Saltfish only to have an opportunity to eat a Calve's Head his Favourite Dish in private that for all his tender Stomach when he was got by himself he would devour Capons Turkeys and Sirloins of Beef like a Cormorant  Two other Witnesses gave the following Evidence That in his officious Attendance upon his Mistress he had try'd to slip in a Powder into her Drink and that once he was catch'd endeavouring to stifle her with a Pillow as she was a sleep that he and  Ptschirnsooker  were often in close Conference and that they us'd to drink together at the  Rose  where it seems he was well enough known by the true Name of  Jack  The Prisoner had little to say in his Defence he endeavour'd to prove himself  Alibi  so that the Trial turn'd upon this single Question whether the said  Timothy Trim  and  Jack  were the same Person which was prov'd by such plain Tokens and particularly by a Mole under the left Pap that  there was no withstanding the Evidence therefore the Worshipful Mr Justice committed him in order to his Tryal  CHAP II  How Jack's Friends came to visit him in Prison and what Advice they gave him  JACK  hitherto had pass'd in the World for a poor simple wellmeaning halfwitted crack'dbrain'd Fellow People were strangely surpriz'd to find him in such a Roguery that he should disguise himself under a false Name hire himself out for a Servant to an old Gentlewoman only for an opportunity to Poison her They said That it was more Generous to profess open Enmity than under a profound Dissimulation to be guilty of such a scandalous Breach of Trust and of the sacred Rights of Hospitality In short the Action was universally Condemn'd by his best Friends they told him in plain terms That this was come as a Judgment upon him for his loose Life his Gluttony Drunkenness and Avarice laying aside his Father's  Will  in an old mouldy Trunk and turning Stockjobber Newsmonger and Busiebody meddling with other Peoples Affairs shaking off his old serious Friends and keeping Company with Buffoons and  Pickpockets his Father's sworn Enemies That he had best throw himself upon the Mercy of the Court Repent and change his Manners To say truth  Jack  heard these Discourses with some Compunction however he resolv'd to try what his new Acquaintance would do for him They sent  Habakkuk Slyboots  who deliver'd him the following Message as the peremptory Commands of his trusty Companions  Habakkuk  Dear  Jack  I am sorry for thy Misfortune Matters have not been carried on with due Secrecy however we must make the best of a bad Bargain Thou art in the utmost Jeopardy that's certain Hang Draw and Quarter are the gentlest things they talk of However thy faithful Friends ever watchful for thy Security bid me tell thee That they have one infallible Expedient left to save thy Life Thou must know we have got into some Understanding with the Enemy by the means of  Don Diego Dismallo  he assures us there is no Mercy for thee and that there is only one way left to Escape it is indeed somewhat out of the common Road however be assur'd it is the result of most mature Deliberation  Jack  Prithee tell me quickly for my Heart is sunk down into the very bottom of my Belly  Hab  It is the unanimous Opinion of your Friends that you make as if you hang'd your  self that they will give it out that you are quite dead and convey your Body out of Prison in a Beir and that  John Bull  being busied with his LawSuit will not enquire further into the matter  Jack  How d'ye mean make as if I had hang'd my self  Hab  Nay you must really hang your self up in a true genuine Rope that there may appear no Trick in it and leave the rest to your Friends  Jack  Truly this is a matter of some Concern and my Friends I hope won't take it ill if I enquire a little into the means by which they intend to deliver me A Rope and a Noose are no jesting Matters  Hab  Why so mistrustful hast▪ thou ever found us false to thee I tell thee there is one ready to cut thee down  Jack  May I presume to ask who it is that is entrusted with that important Office  Hab  Is there no end of thy How's and thy Why's that's a Secret  Jack  A Secret perhaps that I may be safely trusted with for I am not like to tell it again I tell you plainly it is no strange thing for a Man before he hangs himself up to enquire who is to cut him down  Hab  Thou suspicious Creature if thou must needs know it I tell thee it is Sir  Roger  he has been in Tears ever since thy Misfortune  Don Diego  and we have laid it so that  he is to be in the next Room and before the Rope is well about thy Neck rest satisfied he will break in and cut thee down Fear not old Boy we'll do't I'll warrant thee  Jack  So I must hang my self up upon hopes that Sir  Roger  will cut me down and all this upon the Credit of  Don Diego  A fine Stratagem indeed to save my Life that depends upon Hanging  Don Diego  and Sir  Roger  Hab  I tell thee there is a Mystery in all this my Friend a piece of profound Policy if thou knew what good this will do to the Common Cause thy Heart would leap for Joy I'm sure thou would not delay the Experiment one moment  Jack  This is to the Tune of  All for the better  What's your Cause to me when I am hang'd  Hab  Refractory Mortal If thou wilt not trust thy Friends take what follows know assuredly before next full Moon that thou wilt be hung up in Chains or thy Quarters perching upon the most conspicuous Places of the Kingdom Nay I don't believe they will be contented with Hanging they talk of Empaling or breaking on the Wheel and thou chusest that before a gentle suspending of thy self for one Minute Hanging is not so painful a thing as thou imagines I have spoke with several that have undergone it  they all agree it is no manner of uneasiness be sure thou take good notice of the Symptoms the Relation will be curious it is but a kick or two with thy Heels and a wry Mouth or so Sir  Roger  will be with thee in the twinkling of an Eye  Jack  But what if Sir  Roger  should not come will my Friends be there to Succour me  Hab  Doubt it not I will provide every thing against to Morrow Morning do thou keep thy own Secret say nothing I tell thee it is absolutely necessary for the Common Good that thou shouldst go through this Operation  CHAP III  How Jack hang'd himself up by the Perswasion of his Friends who broke their Word and left his Neck in the Noose  JACK  was a profess'd Enemy to  Implicit Faith  and yet I dare say it was never more strongly exerted nor more basely abused than upon this occasion He was now with his old Friends in the state of a poor disbanded Officer after a Peace or rather a wounded Soldier after a Battle like an old Favourite of a cunning Minister after the Jobb is over or a decay'd Beauty to a cloy'd Lover in  quest of new Game or like an hundred such things that one sees every Day There were new Intrigues new Views new Projects on foot  Jack  's Life was the Purchase of  Diego  's Friendship much good may it do them The Interest of  Hocus  and Sir  Williams Crawly  which was now more at Heart made this Operation upon poor  Jack  absolutely necessary You may easily guess that his Rest that Night was but small and much disturb'd however the remaining part of his Time he did not employ as his Custom was formerly in Prayer Meditation or singing a double Verse of a Psalm but amused himself with disposing of his BankStock many a Doubt many a Qualm overspread his clouded Imagination  Must I then quoth he hang up my own personal natural individual Self with these two Hands  Durus Sermo  What if I should be cut down as my Friends tell me There is something Infamous in the very Attempt the World will conclude I had a guilty Conscience Is it possible that good Man Sir  Roger  can have so much pity upon an unfortunate Scoundrel that has persecuted him so many Years No it cannot be I don't love Favours that pass through  Don Diego  's Hands On the other side my Blood chills about my Heart at the thought of these Rogues with their bloody Hands grabbling in my Guts and pulling out my very Entrails  Hang it for once I'll trust my Friends  So  Jack  resolv'd but he had done more wisely to have put himself upon the Tryal of his Country made his Defence in Form many things happen between the Cup and the Lip Witnesses might have been brib'd Juries manag'd or Prosecution stop'd But so it was  Jack  for this time had a sufficient Stock of Implicit Faith which led him to his Ruin as the Sequel of the Story shews And now the fatal Day was come in which he was to try this hanging Experiment His Friends did not fail him at the appointed Hour to see it put in practice  Habakkuk  brought him a smooth strong tough Rope made of many a ply of wholesome  Scandinavian  Hemp compactly twisted together with a Noose that slip'd as glib as a Birdcatcher's Gin  Jack  shrunk and grew pale at first sight of it he handled it measur'd it stretch'd it fix'd it against the Ironbar of the Window to try its strength but no Familiarity could reconcile him to it He found fault with the length the thickness and the twist nay the very colour did not please him  Will nothing less th  n Hanging serve quoth  Jack  Won't my Enemies take Bail for my good Behaviour Will they accept of a Fine or be satisfied with the Pillory and Imprisonment a good round Whipping or Burning in the Cheek  Habakkuk  Nothing but your Blood will appease their Rage make haste else we shall be discover'd There's nothing like surprising the Rogues How they will be disappointed when they hear that thou hast hast prevented their Revenge and hang'd thine own self  Jack  That's true but what if I should do it in Effigies Is there never an old Pope or Pretender to hang up in my stead we are not so unlike but it may pass  Hab  That can never be put upon Sir  Roger  Jack  Are you sure he is in the next Room Have you provided a very sharp Knife in case of the worst  Hab  Dost take me for a common Lyar Be satisfy'd no Damage can happen to your Person your Friends will take care of that  Jack  Mayn't I quilt my Rope it galls my Neck strangely besides I don't like this running Knot it holds too tight I may be stifled all of a sudden  Hab  Thou hast so many If's and And's prithee dispatch it might have been over before this time  Jack  But now I think on't I would fain settle some  Affairs  for fear of the worst Have a little Patience  Hab  There's no having Patience thou art such a faintling silly Creature  Jack  O thou most detestable abominable  Passive Obedience  did I ever imagine I should become thy Votary in so pregnant an Instance how will my Brother  Martin  laugh at this Story to see himself out done in his own Calling He has taken the Doctrine and left me the Practice No sooner had he utter'd these Words but like a Man of true Courage he ty'd the fatal Cord to the Beam fitted the Noose and mounted upon the bottom of a Tub the inside of which he had often Grac'd in his prosperous Days This Footstool  Habakkuk  kick'd away and left poor  Jack  swinging like the Pendulum of  Paul  's Clock The fatal Noose perform'd its Office and with most strict Ligature squeez'd the Blood into his Face 'till it assum'd a purple dye While the poor Man heav'd from the very bottom of his Belly for Breath  Habakuk  walk'd with great Deliberation into both the upper and lower Room to acquaint his Friends who receiv'd the News with great Temper and with Geers and Scoffs instead of Pity  Jack  has Hang'd himself quoth they let us go and see how the poor Rogue swings Then they call'd Sir  Roger  Sir  Roger  quoth  Habakkuk Jack  has hang'd himself make haste and cut him down Sir  Roger  turn'd first one Ear and then t'other not understanding what he said  Hab  I tell you  Jack  has hang'd himself up  Sir  Roger  Who's hang'd  Hab  Jack  Sir  Roger  I thought this had not been hanging Day  Hab  But the poor Fellow has hang'd himself  Sir  Roger  Then let him hang I don't wonder at it the Fellow has been mad these twenty Years With this he slunk away  Then  Jack  's Friends began to hunch and push one another  Why don't you go and cut the poor Fellow down Why don't you and why don't you Not I  quoth one  not I  quoth another  not I  quoth a third  he may hang 'till Doomsday before I relieve him  Nay it is credibly reported that they were so far from succouring their poor Friend in this his dismal Circumstance that  Ptschirnsooker  and several of his Companions went in and pull'd him by the Legs and thump'd him on the Breast Then they began to rail at him for the very thing which they had both advis'd and justify'd before  viz  his getting into the old Gentlewoman's Family and putting on her Livery The Keeper who perform'd the last Office coming up found  Jack  swinging with no Life in him he took down the Body gently and laid it on a Bulk and brought out the Rope to the Company  This Gentlemen is the Rope that hang'd  Jack  What must be done with it  Upon which they order'd it to be laid among the Curiosities of  Gresham  College and it is call'd  Jack  's Rope to this very Day However  Jack  after all had some small Tokens of Life in him but lies at this time past hopes of a total Recovery with his Head hanging on one Shoulder without Speech or Motion The Coroners Inquest supposing him Dead brought him in  Non Compos  CHAP IV  The Conference between Don Diego Dismallo and John Bull  DUring the time of the foregoing Transaction  Don Diego  was entertaining  John Bull  D Diego  I hope Sir this Day's Proceeding will convince you of the Sincerity of your old Friend  Diego  and the Treachery of Sir  Roger  J Bull  What's the matter now  D Diego  You have been endeavouring for several Years to have Justice done upon that Rogue  Jack  but what through the Remissness of Constables Justices and pack'd Juries he has always found the Means to escape  J Bull  What then  D Diego  Consider then who is your best Friend he that would have brought him to  condign Punishment or he that has sav'd him By my Perswasion  Jack  had hang'd himself if Sir  Roger  had not cut him down  J Bull  Who told you that Sir  Roger  has done so  D Diego  You seem to receive me coldly methinks my Services deserve a better Return  J Bull  Since you value your self upon Hanging this poor Scoundrel I tell you when I have any more Hangingwork I'll send for thee I have some better Employment for Sir  Roger  In the mean time I desire the poor Fellow may be look'd after When he first came out of the NorthCountry into my Family under the pretended Name of  Timothy Trim  the Fellow seem'd to mind his Loom and his Spinningwheel till some body turn'd his Head then he grew so pragmatical that he took upon him the Government of my whole Family I could never order any thing within or without doors but he must be always giving his Counsel sorsooth Nevertheless tell him I will forgive what is past and if he would mind his Business for the future and not meddle out of his own Sphere he will find that  John Bull  is not of a cruel Disposition  D Diego  Yet all your skilful Physicians say that nothing can recover your Mother but a piece of  Jack  's Liver boil'd in her Soup  J Bull  Those are Quacks My Mother abhors such Canibal's Food she is in perfect He  lth at present I would have given many a good Pound to have had her so well some time ago There are indeed two or three troublesome old Nurses that because they believe I am tenderhearted will never let me have a quiet Nights Rest with knocking me up Oh Sir your Mother is taken extremely ill she is fall'n into a fainting Fit she has a great Emptiness and wants Sustenance This is only to recommend themselves for their great Care  John Bull  as simple as he is understands a little of a
