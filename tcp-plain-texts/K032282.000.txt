 THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF  ENGLAND  N B  Those Persons who have not Leisure in the present awful and important Crisis of public Affairs to peruse this little Tract may view the  Substance  of it in an ABSTRACT at the End of the Book  "The Work of  RIGHTEOUSNESS" which necessarily in∣cludes the duty of restoring to all men their RIGHTS and just Claims "  shall be  PEACE  and the Effect of  RIGHTEOUSNESS  Quietness and Assurance  for ever"  Isaiah xxxii    For the Throne is established by  RIGHTEOUSNESS  Prov xvi  But  "there is no  PEACE  saith my God to the  WICKED"  Isaiah lvii  LONDON▪ PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXXII  The CLAIMS of the People of ENGLAND  IN the beginning of the present century anno W III a sensible and loyal Writer drew up a small Tract of political information which he intitled  THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND  essayed in a Letter from the Country  But before the Tract was printed the Author had the satisfaction to hear that the  Claims  he had asserted were in many respects established by a new Act of the Parliament then sitting which sea∣sonable attention to the People's  Rights  he most gratefully acknowledged in a Post∣script to his Letter  The  Act of Settlement  by virtue of which the present Royal Family succeeded to the Crown of these Realms was the Statute which then so happily in the opinion of that Writer  secured THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND  It is intitled  An Act for the farther Limitation of the Crown and better se∣curing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject  and accordingly contains  eight very excellent Articles of  Limitation  agreeable to  the Claims of the People of England  which it seems were en∣acted  with the unanimous Concurrence of both Houses of Parliament  for the ex∣press purpose of  securing our Religion Laws and Liberties  One of these Articles ordained"That"    all matters and things relating to the well governing of this  Kingdom  which are properly cognizable in the Privy Coun∣cil by the Laws and Customs of this Realm shall be transacted there and all Resolu∣tions taken thereupon shall be signed by such of the Privy Council as shall advise and consent to the same  This excellent provision would effectually prevent any  secret Council  or Faction from becoming  efficient without Responsibility  And by another of these Articles it was ordained  That no person who has an Office or Place of profit under the King or receives a Pension from the Crown shall be capable of serving as a Member of the House of Commons  It might perhaps have been objected at that time as well as at present that such a  total exclusion of Place∣men  would withdraw from Parliament the Council and Assistance of many worthy Men  in Office  or that ought to be  in Office  whose parliamentary Abilities are the most distinguished and eminent in the Kingdom Yet there is and obvious answer to this objection viz That it is very easy for a free Parliament if in their wisdom they shall think it proper to permit the  great Officers of State  or even  their Secretaries or first Clerks  to have seats in Parliament and as Members not only to declare their opinions but also for the better information of the House even to  debate  and  reply  upon all questions relating to public affairs which might be allowed without any dangerous effect pro∣vided they are duly restrained from the single privilege of VOTING The Nation by this means may have ample be∣nefit in the exercise of their great and shining abilities without risque of  undue influence  which cannot justly be attributed to mere  argument  as that has no other weight or effect than what is fairly due to its merit and any unrea∣sonable  length of speech  whenever it is used with an appa∣rent intention to procrastinate and obstruct the intention of the Majority may be duly restrained at the pleasure of the House But otherwise i e without some due restriction and more especially  without an absolute exclusion from the power of voting  a TREASURY BENCH or any other BENCH OF PLACEMEN in the House of Commons is a  manifest  ABOMINATION utterly repugnant to all just Ideas of a  free uninfluenced Parliament  and consequently is highly derogatory to the honour of that House  But as the Parliament was at that time invested with the dangerous unconstitutio∣nal power of a  triennial  duration without  Re∣election  it was impossible that the  Elected  who thereby acquired a temporary indepen∣dency of the  Electors  and of course too ma∣ny of them a  separate interest  of their own could long continue  real  Representatives of the  People's Claims  and consequently these two most excellent provisions against  undue influence  were unhappily repealed a very  few years afterwards in the th year of Queen Anne c Which amply proves that the most salutary provisions for  the Claims of the people  cannot be securely established under  triennial  or  septennial  Par∣liaments and of course that the antient usage of  sessional  ELECTIONS is a  Claim  of all others the most essentially necessary for our welfare  Since the fatal repeal above mentioned the prevalence of  undue influence  hath so rapidly and enormously increased that the everloyal Citizens of London thought it their duty in the year to bear testi∣mony against it and accordingly they assert∣ed in a public declaration to the King him∣self that  "the"  then  House of Commons did  NOT  represent the people  Representatives of the People are essential to the making of Laws and there is a Time when it is morally demonstrable that Men cease to be Representatives That Time is now arrived THE PRESENT HOUSE OF COMMONS DO NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE  Address of the Mayor Aldermen c of the City of London  Subsequent Facts have demonstrated the absolute necessity we are now under to  claim  and promote an  unequivocal  abolition of all  undue Influence  in Parliament  Measures the most  unrighteous  as well as the most  ruinous  that could have been de∣vised  have been adopted and carried on under a pretended sanction of  parliamentary Authority  This must of course be understood to refer if you please only to  former  Parliaments that began the Mischief whose  pretended Sanction  had more of the  Name  than the  Reality  of  parliamentary Authority  if a  real Representation of the Commons  be at all essential to constitute a true  legal Par∣liament  The Representatives are chosen by a  very small Propor∣tion  of the People and even that  small Proportion  of People is so monstrously  unequal  in their  power of delegation  that the small Number of Borough Voters elect Re∣presentatives which is very near  half  the Number of Re∣presentatives that are due to six Millions of People and  more than half  or a  Majority  of the Numbers that are ever known to attend at any one Time The INJUSTICE of such an  enormous Disproportion  in the Representation of the whole People cannot be parallelled by any other gross Ab∣surdity except THE INIQUITY of rendering that  dispro∣portionate Representation  still more contemptible and nuga∣tory by SEPTENNIAL or what were nearly as pernicious TRIENNIAL instead of the ancient constitutional Usage of SESSIONAL ELECTIONS  which have involved both King and People whose true interests are inseparable in the most alarming difficul∣ties and the ostensible Agents in the mis∣chief have obstinately persevered to the ut∣most extension of  ability  until public Di∣sasters and a happy preventive incapacity of their own their Heads and Funds being equally exhausted of council and resource have compelled them to make a temporary retreat though the nu∣merous  Corps of Placemen Pensioners Contractors c occasionally procured them a shameful Majority almost to the last  Hence it is evident that the  Corruption of Parliament  is the real source of all our national calamities and grievances which cannot therefore be relieved by a  mere change of Ministry  The  Minority  in Parliament hath once before in the memory of most men be∣come the  Majority  and the worthy Op∣posers of bad measures were indulged with a temporary administration of public Affairs until the secret  efficient Cabinet  could reco∣ver from the surprise and dismay of their former defeat in Parliament and by a renewed exertion of their  undue influence  were able to shackle the new Administra∣tion with the rueful alternative either to abandon their newlyacquired dignities or else to adopt such measures as must effec∣tually deprive them of the people's confi∣dence after which they were contemp∣tuously compelled one by one or as it might best suit the purposes of the reigning system of  undue influence  to yield up their places for the emolument of the more pliant creatures of the secret faction  It would be madness for  Englishmen  af∣ter such galling experience to neglect their just and indispensible  Claim  to some imme∣diate and effectual precaution against similar  delusions  To trust another new Adminis∣tration without insisting at the same time on a constitutional  limitation of power  by a  free uninfluenced Representation of the Commons  may be dangerous to our very existence as an independent Kingdom  The reduced circumstances of the Na∣tion cannot admit the risque of another such credulous experiment  It is therefore become absolutely neces∣sary for the security both of King and Peo∣ple which includes the  true interest  of all parties that the just  "Claims of the Peo∣ple"  be satisfied in an immediate Restora∣tion of the antient  legal  and  responsible  Go∣vernment by a  Revival  of the two repealed Articles of the Act of Settlement above recited and by a  Revival  also of that most excellent Statute for SESSIONAL PARLIA∣MENTS passed in the th of K Ed III c declaring  "that a Parliament"  meaning a  newlyelected  Parliament as the writs of those times incontestably demon∣strate  shall be holden every year once and more often if need be  But this indispen∣sible  Right  and  Claim  of the People for the Act itself is no more than an authentic  De∣claration  or  Acknowledgement  of an antient  Right  cannot have complete  effect  without totally repealing an  Act  of the th year of K Hen VI cap vii which on  false pretences  whereby it is rendered unwor∣thy the title and dignity of a  Statute  dis∣franchised at once by far the greatest part of the English Nation by robbing them of their BIRTHRIGHT  In the Act of Settlement by virtue of which the pre∣sent King sits on the Throne it is declared that  the Laws of England are the Birthright of the people thereof  and according to an antient Maxim of the Common Law this our  Birthright in the Laws  is to be esteemed our  most valuable inheritance  superior to every other Denomination of PROPERTY  Major Haereditas unicuique venit a jure et legibus quam a parentibus  Lord Coke says it  is  the best Birthright the subject hath for thereby his Goods Lands Wife Children his Body Life Honour and Estimation are protected from injury and wrong  and then he cites the maxim "  Major Haereditas c  Inst p An Act of Parliament therefore which sets up an  inferior  and mere  pecuniary property  as the object of  representation  not only in  preference  but to the total  exclu∣sion  of that  superior property  or personal Right which ought to be esteemed the  most valuable inheritance  or  BEST BIRTHRIGHT  the subject hath  c is such a  malum in so  such an iniquitous contempt and infringement of  Common Right  against  Reason and Justice  and against the express declaration of a  fundamental principle of the English Constitution  cannot fail to render the Act  null and void in itself  if the People will but unite in maintain∣ing this just and legal plea against it for which they have ample authority See Doctor and Student c where∣in it is declared that  Statutes cannot exist against  REASON  or the  LAW DIVINE    nec contra  RATIONEM  nec contra  LEGEM  divinam existant  for the execrable  ini∣quity  abovementioned is surely  against both  and there∣fore as  these two Laws  the Law of  Reason  and the  Law of God    cannot abate or turn aside    Hae duae Leges declinari non possunt  ib c it is manifest that the unjust Act is utterly unworthy to be named a  Statute  and must needs be  void  Plowden has reported a variety of cases wherein Acts of Par∣liament were esteemed  void in Law  through the want of  truth  in the  recitals  See pages to  Sharp's Declaration p Which legal  disqualification  is obvious in the preamble to the Act in question  as it cannot otherwise be esteemed than a mere  corruption  or  corruptela  according to the ex∣press direction of the same approved Author in his d ch viz  Against this Law  i e the  Law of Reason    prescription  STATUTE  nor custom may not prevail and if any be brought in against it they be not prescriptions  STATUTES  nor Customs but  CORRUPTIONS COR∣RUPTELAE  things  VOID  and against Justice  Doct et Stud Eng ed p  the inestimable  Right  of voting for Representatives in Parliament without which they cannot properly be esteemed  Freemen  because the  Laws  their BIRTHRIGHT and  most valuable Property  may be  changed suspended  or  entirely with∣drawn from them  without their consent whereas in antient times they enjoyed not only the privilege of voting in  plen Countie i e  the full Countycourt or Parlia∣ment of each County for the Knights of the Shire but frequently also for the Citi∣zens  and Burgesses elected in their respec∣tive Counties whereby the  Equality  of  Representation  was then preserved and may again be happily restored by some such equitable mode of transferring the represen∣tation of  depopulated  or notoriously venal Bo∣roughs to the Decision of their respective  County courts  Which method of  equalising Representation  deserves preference to all others because it is not liable to the odious charge of  innovation  but on the contrary is authenticated by  longcontinued usage and legal Precedents of ancient times  and the same may be said of all the other changes already recommended in this Address  By these approved and tried means the just  claims of the people  may be  amply  as well as  easily  established and the happy ef∣fects of such a perfect Reformation would be  security  and  support  to any  virtuous  Ad∣ministration for it would prevent their just measures from being  impeded  and  clogged  by the secret machinations of any private  Cabal  or Cabinet  Faction  that might otherwise be  efficient  without  Responsibility  and it would also exclude the interested op∣position of needy unprincipled persons who at present can  introduce themselves  into Plmt if they can but find credit for  the purchasemoney merely for the pur∣poses of  private interest  a  Trade  as  dishonourable  to themselves as it is  baneful  to the Nation for the  Representation  of many Boroughs is now commonly esteemed a mere pecuniary property and as such has in many instances been either notoriously  bought and sold  or else is holden at the ab∣solute disposal of  single Individuals  Peers and other overgrown Landholders for the dangerous purpose of enhancing their  own personal consequence  An  "undue Influence"  this in whatsoever hands it is lodged that is most detestably  disgraceful to the Nation  as well as fundamentally  derogatory to the validity of every legislative Resolution  and what is still more alarming will completely  ruin  the Kingdom if the constitutional Re∣medies here proposed are not speedily a∣dopted  London  March    A LOYAL ENGLISHMAN  An ABSTRACT of the  Claims c  and of the constitutional Means of redressing public Grie∣vances without  Innovation  P  CLAIM I THAT neither the  Privy Council  nor any  secret Cabinet  for State Affairs ought to be  efficient without responsibility  P n and p  REMEDY Revive a repealed clause of the Act of Settlement  "That all matters cognizable in the  PRIVY COUNCIL  shall be transacted there c  P  CLAIM II That  all undue influence of the Crown  ought to be totally excluded from Parliament p and that a  "Treasurybench"  or any other  Bench of Placemen  in the House of Commons unless duly restrain∣ed from the privilege of  voting  is an ABOMINATION utterly repugnant to all just ideas of a  free uninfluenced  Parliament P n  REMEDY Revive a repealed Clause of the Act of Settlement  That no person  who has an office or place of profit under the King c shall be capable of serving as Members of the House of Commons  P  NB  The ordinary objection to this clause may be obviated by permitting the  great Officers of State their Secretaries c  to sit debate and inform the House but with∣out privilege of  voting  P n  CLAIM III That  the Laws of England  are  the  BIRTHRIGHT  of the People there∣of  p n yet the greater part of the People are robbed of the  Birthright  by an unconstitutional exclusion from any share in the Legislature so that  the Laws the most valuable Property to  EVERY MAN "UNICUIQUE VENIT"  c  p may be changed  suspended  or repealed without their assent P  REMEDY Repeal the Act of Hen VI c whereby the People in general were robbed of that BIRTHRIGHT P  CLAIM IV That the  Representation of the People  ought to be rendered  more equal  REMEDY Refer the enormous dispro∣portion of  delegating  power now enjoyed by  venal  Boroughs p n to the deci∣sion of the  CountyCourts  according to an∣tient Precedents P  CLAIM V Experience has demonitra∣te  that neither  the most salutary provisions for our just Claims  can long subsist p nor any  Changes of Ministry  p be effectual to restore them under  triennial  and  septennial  Parliaments p so that the an∣tient usage of renewing the Representation BY A GENERAL ELECTION EVERY SES∣SION is the most essential  Claim  of all others for the welfare of the Kingdom P  REMEDY Revive the Statute for SES∣SIONAL PARLIAMENTS Ed III c See p  The certain Effect of these  constitutional Remedies  will be  Security  and  Support  to a  virtuous  Administration P  THE END
