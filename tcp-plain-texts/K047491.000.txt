SCENE I  MARTIN  and  LUCETTA  meeting  Luc  MR Martin good morning you are abroad very early Have you alter'd your hour of rising or are you troubled with a bad conscience  Mart  I make you as early a visit as this is my dear girl each morning of my lifein imagi∣nationbut I now pay my duty to you in per∣son and by order of my master He poor soul full of anxiety bad me attend your levée for an account of the health of that sweet swain his uncle How has he passed the night  Luc  Never worse  Mart  Heav'n be praised The old fellow must have had a noble constitution or he never could have stood buff at once to so many diseases  Luc  Very true He has twice within these two days fallen into my arms in a profound lethargy  and I believe no earthly care but mine could have revived him  Mart  O curse your care And pray how are you rewarded  Luc  Why I can't say I have either present pay or good quarters He seems sensible of my good offices but begs to be excused the paying for themHe indeed promises faithfully to remem∣ber me in his Will  Mart  What is he going to make one at last  Luc  Immediatelywhere my name I believe will make no small figure  Mart  Heav'n send it say Ithe old fellow must be very rich  Luc  Rich so he had need be to satisfy all those who are gaping for his death  Mart  He'll treat them with a mouthful of moonshine My master flatters himself the best part of the wealth will fall to his lot I think I as a relation am entitled to a legacy  Luc  A relation You  Mart  Yes IMy master and his uncle are re∣lations that can't be deny'dMy late wife was as obliging as she was handsomeindeed we were look'd on as the most agreeable couple in the pa∣rishbut let that pass She I say by a small ex∣ertion of that good nature for which she was re∣markable took care that my master and I should be kin O I'm certainly one of the family  Luc  At that rate I believe you are related to more families than this O wedlock would be a wealthy state indeed if husbands could inherit by such a title  Mart  True truebut joking apart'tis ne∣cessary that we should do every thing in our power to forward this will get it made and to our  liking toofor if my master should not be remem∣bered by the old gentleman he must the rest of his days take up with very spare diet But what is most materially to be considered is the reward of five hundred which he has promised to give you and me as secret service money on the day of his marriage with Myra and which to avoid disputes concerning dividends you have consented shall be common stock and we are to follow their example O here comes my master  Enter  SAVILLE  Sav  Well my dear Lucetta what news af∣ford me some comfort How is my poor uncle How has he passed the night Can he bear com∣pany May I be permitted to see him this morn∣ing  Luc  Really Sir he has passed the night very ill and if I can form any judgment he has not a right to expect many more on this side the grave  Sav  Good heav'n What say you Lucetta Notwithstanding my great expectations duty and nature are very powerful in me and his approach∣ing end causes certain emotions which you cannot feel or I describe  Mart  I cannot answer for her feelings or your descriptions but as to emotions I believe they are such as I felt when I paid the last duties to my poor dear wife of pious memory I found myself attacked by a kind of a certain fort of aflowpungentpleasingmelancholythat had such an effect on my spirits thatas ifin short as you say Sir it is a situation easier felt than told and what many a married man wishes to experi∣ence  that he may become a more competent judge  Luc  I believe the old gentleman begins to think himself in a bad way at last for he has or∣dered me to provide two proctors  Sav  My heart throbs to find my fate so near its crisis  Luc  Be of good cheer Sir I believe all will go well within these two days he and your mi∣stress's mother Mrs Watchly were laying their heads together and in deep muttering for some timeDeedslegaciesmarriages and so forth and I make no doubt the main point was making a conditional match for you and the young lady  Sav  Don't flatter me Lucetta Heaven is my witness I should not think wealth worth a wish did it not shorten the journey of my desires to my dear Myra  Luc  Come come Sir you are in a fair way of having bothNay I make no doubt of your being sole heirTroth 'twould grieve me to see the stock divided for Sir I know you would do a world of good with itNow as to your pro∣mise to Martin and me I know  Sav  Say no more of that Lucetta I remem∣ber my promise and will be even better than my word  Luc  O Sir I don't doubt your generosity and I hope I may venture to say I shall not be al∣together unworthy I have always kept praising you and your good qualities to the old gentleman Lord Sir says I how happy are you in such a nephew so sweet a disposition so complaisant so respectful not urged to attend you like most of your relations from a principle of selfishness but by a regard of the most delicate and tender nature  Mart  You hear Sir how well she knows and describes youto say the truth Sir I think you can no more overrate  her  merit than she can over∣praise  yours  Sav  I think her desert is greatand I'll tell you what else I think  Mart  What Sir  Sav  That you are not quite disinterested in your recommendation  Mart  Why the truth is Sir the poor girl has cast a favourable eye on the person and good qua∣lities of your humble servant and I have con∣sented to follow your example I'm sure Sir you can't blame me for taking pity on her  Luc  Pity Saucebox pity  Mart  O that dissembled anger becomes you mightily You see Sir she has her attractions she's young handsome  en bon point  andI had better not be too lavish neither lest he shou'd take a fancy to her too  Luc  Hush I hear the old gentleman You have detain'd me so long here I shan't be able to go to the Proctors Run you Martin directly and tell them to come hither they both live in Doctor's Commons one is named Caveat the other Itemgo  Mart  I fly  Exit  Enter  LINGER  Ling  Ah Nephew goodmorrow  Sav  Dear Sir how do you find yourself sit down SirLucetta draw forward the armchair that my uncle may be more at his ease  Ling  Sososo  sits down  Sav  I think Sir you look much better than when I saw you lastBut Sir I really think you don't do yourself justice your frame must be much weaken'd by your disorder and you neglect the proper applications to restore it  Ling  They are not to be had nephew without a considerable expence Those props for the constitution are very dear and I think the building so crazy 'tis hardly worth repairing But dear Charles I'm glad you call'd for I have some thoughts of settling my small worldly mattersHave you sent for the Proctors  to Lucetta  Luc  Yes Sir and expect them here very soon  Ling  My good Charles I shall take care of thee  Sav  I have no cause to doubt it Sir  Ling  You know that I have relations that euh euh  coughs  Luc  Yes in troth a hopeful pack and a com∣fortable number  Ling  Who watch my door as eagerly as the undertaker  Sav  I hope my uncle knows me too well to put me in the list  Luc  Heaven be praised I shall see the harpies fitted for their avarice Such a crew hungry as wolves and cunning as foxes O what raising of shoulders and dropping of jaws there will be whenever the will's produc'd and the long ex∣pected ticket proves a blank Never stir Sir but I think it wou'd be worth a trip from the other world to behold their disappointment  Ling  May be so LucettaBut as I am not got there yet I need not at present think about making the experiment However I'll put my  affairs in order and have sent for the Proctors to take my instructions  Luc  Sir you

How are you Sir I did not expect after what I heard this morning to find you so well We were alarmed with a report that you had had a bad night and were given over  Ling  Oh Madam those reports are spread by my vile relations who speak as they wishI was never better  Sav  I think Madam my uncle's countenance is a confirmation of it he really looks like a man of thirty  Luc  Aside  Yes in a coffin  Ling  My case must be desperate indeed if those bright eyes could not work a cure Euh euh  coughs  looking at Myra  Mrs Wat  You see my dear Myra the man I have fix'd on as your future husband and I am convinced you are too well acquainted with your duty to dispute my pleasure  Myra  It is true Madam my duty urges a con∣sent but believe me my compliance can answer no other end than to convince the gentleman of  his mistake and make me unhappyHe will find upon a short trial my eyes will not have the won∣derful effect his present partiality ascribes to them  Sav  That Madam must be according as they are applied I dare say when rightly used they have a very healing quality  Ling  Ah well said Charles I believe I shall prove the truth of what you say and in a few months give occasion for a report that will not be so pleasing to my hungry relationsasEuh euh  coughs  Luc  To Myra  Lord Madam how melan∣choly you look you don't seem in the least to be sensible of your felicitywhy you'll be the envy of your sexPinmoney for the present a fine jointure in future a charming equipage a hand∣some man a parcel of sweet babes and the curses of all your husband's relationsI know no happi∣ness like it  Ling  Thank you Lucetta thank you  Myra  I can't bear this impertinence Why Sir  to Linger  they are laughing both at you and me  Ling  Laughing at uswho is it my sweet Myra that dares to laugh at us What is it you nephew  Sav  Heaven forbid SirI was never more se∣rious than I am at present Were I in your place I would do just the same Warm passions require a wife and a good estate wants an heir the young lady's mother gives her consent and I would marry the sweet young amiable creature directly  looking tenderly at Myra  Ling  You mean me nephew  Sav  To be sure Sir  Myra  Is it then your advice Sir that I obey my mother's commands  Sav  Aside  'Sdeath what shall I sayO hy∣pocrisy  Myra  Sir  Sav  Madam duty would speak should I be silent  Myra  I say no more Sir you have proved your duty by pleading for your uncle and advising me I for my part Madam shall prove mine by an immediate compliance with your will when∣ever called upon  Exit in haste  Sav  Aside to Lucetta  For heaven's sake Lu∣cetta follow her down and explain matters You see my miserable situationbut I'll forfeit every hope rather than suffer her to entertain suspicions of my fidelity  Luc  So sohere will be fine work  Exit Lucetta  Mrs Wat  You see Sir it is as I told you my daughter yields to me in all things and when I have transferred my right I dare say she will as chearfully submit to yours  Sav  O Madam there is not the least ground for doubt  Mrs Wat  I will immediately follow Myra and have no doubt of settling every thing to your wish you shall hear from me by tomorrow morning In the mean time you may proceed in regard to the writings  Ling  I shall think every moment an age Dear Madam yours  Exit Mrs Watchly  Ling  A very discreet wellbred discerning wo∣man

Time will move but slowly till I have reached the end of all my wishes  Sav  I shall be ready to attend you Sirand that I may be ready I shall wait within call  Aside  Exit  Ling  I vow Lucetta the tumult my heart has been in at the thoughts of possessing that sweet young creature has quite overpowered meI am afraid my passion has gone too far and has un∣dertaken more than my strength can

till he has reached the end of all his wishes"  He moves so slowly that I should rather think he'll sooner reach the end of all his cares another wayA pleasant situation this  of mine Was ever poor devil betrayed into such a scene of complicated hypocrisy What violence have I done myself these few last minutes and for what The old lady I know is pretty positive She does not give her daughter to the man but to the fortune and I seem to stand a worse chance for that than everThen what hope have I Nonebut in the chapter of accidents which as often befriends poor young fellows as poor poli∣ticians  Enter  MARTIN  Well Martin what have you been doing  Mart  Tiring my legs and breaking my wind by running to and againafter your businessI have at last got to the speech of the

fulfil ours  Sav  What do you think of making a marriage contract  Mart  No sure who in the name of cuck∣oldom is to be the happy woman  Sav  No other than my own dear Myra What do you think of that  Mart  Why I think if the wedding takes place Mrs Watchly will be a cruel avaritious je∣zabel that e'er long the old man will be heartily tir'd and Miss heartily mortifiedthat you will run distracted these put together will make up a bad piece of news for your creditors and I shall run away which I may say without vanity Sir will be a very severe stroke upon you  Sav  Sir your servant I wish they may bear their loss with half the patience that I shall mine  Enter  LUCETTA  Sav  Well Lucetta what news  Luc  The best in the world I think your uncle grows worse and worse and his wishes for the match seem to give way with his health I did as you desired with Miss MyraI am con∣vinced all the old lady's rhetoric will be thrown awaythis I have told the old gentleman not omitting a few aggravating circumstances which invention supplied me with and he as good as says he has no hopesNow if we can but  bell rings  Hark his bell ringsI'll go to him and make the best use of my time ay

wished for the proctors that he would now leave you sole heir O what a time to be taken off sole heir Sir only think of that sosososole heir Ooo  crying  Sav  Then fate has done its worst  Mart  Come come this is no time for re∣flectionthe holes made by fate we must patch up with industryself preservation is the first law of nature Secure all the old gentleman's move∣ables before his death is made

affairYour uncle's death must be imme∣diately  knownStayI have a thoughtSup∣pose we darken the room as much as will serve our purpose put your uncle's cap one of his old gowns and so forth on Martin throw him on the settee and then let him as your uncle dictate the heads of a will which can never be disputed and consequently put you in possession of all your present wishes  Sav  What say you Martin to this expedient  Mart  Say That I am ready to march when∣ever you give the word of command Our temp∣tations are woman and gold so far we are even but as you are commander and I only a common

money the lady's friends a great deal of money and a very small share either of right or understandingsobut as I have told you the situation of both parties I dare say Brother Item we may both guess how it will end  Enter  SAVILLE  Sav  Gentlemen your most obedient  Item  Sir yourspray how is good Mr Linger  Sav  Why Sir in a very disagreeable situation and I fear near his endWhen he sent to you we had very little expectation of his living till you camebut he has taken a little nap since and seems tolerably refresh'd He is preparing to re∣ceive you  Caveat  See Sir how contrary to his intentions things might have endedA man who has any thing to leave should not defer settling his affairs till the last moment Some idle people will tell you that a man may often change his mind as to the disposal of his property So let him so let himhe can also change the form of his will as often and might I advise a man of fortune should rather make ten wills a month than live a month after he's of age without one  Sav  Sir my uncle without hearing your opi∣nion seems conscious of his error and wants to do all in his power to prevent the inconveniencies you seem to apprehend from his neglect He is wholly unable to bear much light or talktherefore I must beg you will put up with as little of one and provoke as little of the other as the nature of the case will admit Come gentlemen I'll shew you the way  Exeunt  Scene draws and discovers  Martin  as  Linger  on a couch  Lucetta  waiting  Enter  SAVILLE ITEM  and  CAVEAT  Mart  Gentlemen I'm glad you are here and in health I really don't envy you though I can∣not  help wishing that I had as good a stock that making a will might not be so immediately ne∣cessary  Caveat  Courage my good Sir a man is not a bit nearer death for making his will nay I affirm the very contraryNothing so likely to give re∣pose as easing the mind nothing so likely to ease the mind as settling one's worldly affairs nothing so absolute a settlement of worldly affairs as a well made willergoa well made will is the likeliest medicine to reestablish health  Mart  Heaven send I may find it so  Caveat  I warrant youNeighbour Item you have the materialslet us beginBut first it may be proper that these parties quit the room  Luc  O I cannot leave my dear master  Sav  Nay Lucetta my uncle must determine for us both  Mart  O gentlemen I am under great obli∣gations to them and as they are pretty well ap∣prised of my intentions their retiring will be un∣necessary  Cav  We shall proceed then immediately The common preamble  In the name  and so forth we may supposenow Sir to the substance of the business  Mart  After the discharge of my debts which I desire may be paid forthwith  Sav  Dear Sir those are but small I am sure and not worth the mention  Mart  Nay I owe to Bob Mixum at the Sun Tavern above fifty pounds for wine  Cav  Very well Sirhave you a desire to be interred at any particular place  Mart  No noI have but one injunction to lay on that particularwhich is that I may be buried at as little an expence as possible  Luc  Ah my dear master retains his prudence to the last  Cav  Well Sir please to let us know what

thousand pounds sterling  Luc  Heaven reward you dear Sir 'tis too much too much your kindness so overwhelms  me I shall never live to enjoy it The dear soul always said I should be well remembered  Sav  Aside  O the rascal this is a spice of his old trade which I was not prepared for Well Sir I fancy this is the whole of your instructions  Mart  No no I have two or three more words to sayItem I give and bequeath unto the said Martin Sly  Sav  The scoundrel is making a will with a witness  Aside  Mart  Whether he marries the said Lucetta or notfor his good and faithful services to me and his master  Sav  Services why dear Sir you are con∣scious there is not a more worthless fellow  Mart  O nephew you don't know his merits so well as I do I say in consideration of his good qualities

What is the matter nephew is it not enough think you  Sav  Enough Sir in my opinion it is by far too much and that he ought to think himself more than paid with a small part of it  Mart  No the full

Mart  Sothat's over and I think I have play'd my part tolerably well  Sav  Too well for me Pray tell me Sir you must have lost your wits or all sense of shame How could you think of giving Lucetta such a sum a thousand pounds  Mart  The poor girl should be made easy Sir I could not in conscience leave her less  Sav  Conscienceit was to ease that very conscience too rascal that you gave yourself the moderate reward of two hundred a year  Mart  I am sorry you are displeased Sir But we can set it all to rights The will is not yet executed When the proctors return you may dismiss themor let me execute it and afterwards put it in the fire and let matters stand as your good uncle left them  Sav  Aside  The arch rascal has me secure on every side Well Martin I've doneyou  shall have your annuity but you must deserve it by some further assiduity in the affair I cannot leave the house and as it will be some time before the proctors can finish their business you must to answer present occasions put yourself in statu quo then send the boy to Mrs Watchly Let him tell her and my dear Myra I am impatient to see them and beg they will pay me a visit here He must say my uncle is confined

'tis true my uncle promised to leave all to me in preference to every other relation But tho' he had an undoubted right so to give it I have by no means a privilege thus to take itI will however so far make use of the fraud as to blind Mrs Watchly and when Myra and I are settled I make no doubt of gaining her pardon for the deceit and liberty to make satisfaction to all parties  Enter  LUCETTA
