 Sally of our Alley  OF all the girls in our town  There's none like pretty Sally  She is the darling of my heart  And lives in our alley  There's ne'er a lady in the land  Is half so sweet as Sally  She is the darling of my heart  And lives in our alley  Her father he makes cabbage nets  And in the streets does cry them  Her mother she sells laces long  To all who chuse to buy them  But sure such folks could ne'er beget  So sweet a girl as Sally  She is the darling c  When Sally's by I leave my work  I love her so sincerely  My master comes like any Turk  And bangs me most severely  But let him bang his belly full  I'll bear it all for Sally she is c  Of all the days that's in the week  I dearly love but one day  And that's the day that comes between  A Saturday and Monday  O then I'm drest in all my best  To walk abroad with Sally she is c  My master carries me to church  And often I am blamed  Because I leave him in the lurch  As soon as text is named  I leave the church in sermon time  And slink away to Sally she is c  When Christmas comes about again  O then I shall have money  I'll hoard it up and box and all  I'll give it to my Sally  And would it were a thousand pounds  I'd give it all to Sally she is c  My master and the neighbours all  Make game of me and Sally  And but for her I'd better be  A slave and row a galley  But when my seven long years are out  O then I'll marry Sally  O then we'll wed and then we'll bed  But not in our alley  Printed and sold by  J DAVENPORT  No Little Chatherinestreet Strand London
