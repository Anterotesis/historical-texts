his ingenious and impartial Account of  John Bull  's LawSuit yet there is just Cause of Complaint against him in that he retails it only by Parcels and won't give us the whole Work This forces me who am only the Publisher to bespeak the Assistance of his Friends and Acquaintance to engage him to lay aside that stingy Humour and gratify the Curiosity of the Publick at once He pleads in excuse that they are only private Memoirs wrote for his own Use in a loose Style to serve as a help to his ordinary Conversation I represented to him the good Reception the two first Parts had met that tho' they had been calculated by him only for the Meridian of  Grubstreet  yet they were taken Notice of by the better sort that the World was now sufficiently acquainted with  John Bull  and interested it self in his little Concerns He Answer'd with a Smile that he had indeed some trifling Things to impart that concerned  John Bull  's Relations and Domestick Affairs if these would satisfy me he gave me free leave to make use of them because they would serve to make the History of the LawSuit more intelligible When I had look'd over the Manuscript I found likewise some further Account of the Composition which perhaps may not be unacceptable to such as have read the two former Parts  CHAP I The Character of  John Bull's  Mother  JOHN  had a Mother whom he Lov'd and Honour'd extremely a Discreet Grave Sober Good Condition'd Cleanly Old Gentlewoman as ever liv'd she was none of your Crossgrain'd termagant  scolding Jades that one had as good be hang'd as live in the House with such as are always censuring the Conduct and telling scandalous Stories of their Neighbours extolling their own good Qualities and undervaluing those of others On the contrary she was of a Meek Spirit and as she was strictly Virtuous her self so she always put the best Construction upon the Words and Actions of her Neighbours except where they were irreconcileable to the Rules of Honesty and Decency She was neither one of your precise  Prudes  nor one of your phantastical old  Belles  that Dress themselves like Girls of Fifteen as she neither wore a Ruff Forehead Cloth nor Highcrown'd Hat so she had laid aside Feathers Flowers and crimpt Ribons in her Headdress Furbulow Scarfs and Hoop'd Petticoats She scorn'd to Patch and Paint yet she lov'd to keep her Hands and her Face Clean Tho' she wore no flaunting lac'd Ruffles she would not keep her self in a constant Sweat with greasy Flannel Tho' her Hair was not stuck with Jewels she was not asham'd of a Diamond Cross she was not like some Ladies hung about with Toys and Trinkets Twiser Cases PocketGlasses and Essence Bottles she us'd only a Gold Watch and an Almanack to mark the Hours and the HolyDays Her Furniture was neat and genteel well fancy'd with  a bon Goust  As she affected not the Grandeur of a State with a Canopy she thought there was no Offence in an Elbow Chair she had laid aside your Carving Gilding and Japan Work as being too apt to gather Dirt but she never could be prevail'd upon to part with plain Wainscot and clean Hangings There are some Ladies that affect to smell a stink in every Thing they are always highly perfum'd and continually burning Frankincense in their Rooms she was above such Affectation yet she never would lay aside the Use of Brooms and scrubbing Brushes and scrupl'd not to lay her Linnen in fresh Lavender She was no less genteel in her Behaviour wellbred without Affectation in the due mean between one of your affected Cursying  pieces of Formality and your Romps that have no regard to the common Rules of Civility There are some Ladies that affect a Mighty regard for their Relations  We must not Eat to Day for my Uncle  Tom  or my Cousin  Betty  dy'd this time ten Years    Let's have a Ball to Night it is my Neighbour such a ones Birthday  she look'd upon all this as Grimace yet she constantly observ'd her Husband's Birthday her Weddingday and some few more Tho' she was a truly good Woman and had a sincere Motherly Love for her Son  John  yet there wanted not those who endeavour'd to create a Misunderstanding between them and they had so far prevail'd with him once that he turn'd her out of Doors to his geeat Sorrow as he found afterwards for his Affairs went all at sixes and sevens She was no less Judicious in the turn of her Conversation and Choice of her Studies in which she far exceeded all her Sex your Rakes that hate the Company of all sober grave Gentlewomen would bear hers and she would by her handsome manner of proceeding sooner reclaim than some that were more sower and reserv'd she was a zealous Preacher up of Chastity and Conjugal Fidelity in Wives and by no means a Friend to the newfangl'd Doctrine of the  Indispensible Duty of Cuckoldom  Tho she advanc'd her Opinions with a becoming Assurance yet she never usher'd them in as some positive Creatures will do with dogmatical Assertions  This is infallible I cannot be mistaken none but a Rogue can deny it  It has been observ'd that such People are oftner in the Wrong than any Body tho' she had a thousand good Qualities she was not without her Faults amongst which one might perhaps reckon too great Lenity to her Servants to whom she always gave good Counsel but often too gentle Correction I thought I could not say less of  John Bull  's Mother because she bears a part in the following Transactions  CHAP II The Character of  John Bull  's Sister  Peg  with the Quarrels that happen'd between Master and Miss in their Childhood  JOHN  had a Sister a poor Girl that had been starv'd at Nurse any Body would have guess'd Miss to have been bred up under the Influence of a cruel StepDame and  John  to be the Fondling of a tender Mother  John  look'd ruddy and plump with a pair of Cheeks like a Trumpeter Miss look'd pale and wan as if she had the GreenSickness and no wonder for  John  was the Darling he had all the good Bits was cramm'd with good Pullet Chicken Pig Goose and Capon while Miss had only a little Oatmeal and Water or a dry Crust without Butter  John  had his golden Pippens Peaches and Nectarnes poor Miss a Crap Apple Sloe or Blackberry Master lay in the best Apartment with his Bed Chamber toward the South Sun Miss lodg'd in a Garret expos'd to the North Wind which shrevel'd her Countenance however this Usage tho it stunted the poor Girl in her Growth gave her a hardy Constitution she had Life and Spirit in abundance and knew when she was ill used Now and then she would seize upon  John  's Commons snatch a Leg of a Pullet or a bit of good Beef for which they were sure to go to Fisticuffs Master was indeed too strong for her but Miss would not yield in the least Point but ev'n when Master had got her down she would scratch and bite like a Tyger when he gave her a Cuff on the Ear she would prick him with her KnittingNeedle  John  brought a great Chain one Day to tye her to the Bed Post for which Affront Miss aim'd a Penknife at his Heart In short these Quarrels grew up to rooted Aversions they gave one another Nicknames she call'd him  Gundyguts  and he call'd her Lousy  Peg  Tho' the Girl was a right clever Wench as any was and thro' her pale Looks you might discern Spirit and Vivacity which made her not indeed a perfect Beauty but something that was agreeable It was barbarous  in Parents not to take Notice of these early Quarrels and make them live better together such Domestick Fewds proving afterwards the occasion of Misfortunes to them both  Peg  had indeed some odd Humours and comical Antipathy for which  John  would jeer her  What think you of my Sister  Peg  says he    that faints at the Sound of an Organ and yet will dance and frisk at the Noise of a Bagpipe What's that to you  Gundyguts  quoth  Peg  every Body's to chuse their own Musick  ' Then Peg had taken a Fancy not to say her  Paternoster  which made People imagine strange things of her Of the three Brothers that have made such a Clutter in the World Lord  Peter    Martin  and  Jack    Jack  had of late been her Inclinations Lord  Peter  she detested nor did  Martin  stand much better in her good Graces but  Jack  had found the way to her Heart I have often admir'd what Charms she discover'd in that aukward Booby till I talk'd with a Person that was acquainted with the Intrigue who gave me the following Account of it  CHAP III  Jack  's Charms or the Method by which he gain'd  Peg  's Heart  IN the first place  Jack  was a very young Fellow by much the youngest of the three Brothers and People indeed wonder'd how such a young upstart Jackanapes shou'd grow so pert and saucy and take so much upon him  Jack  brag'd of greater Abilities than other Men he was well gifted as he pretended I need not tell you what secret Influence that has upon the Ladies  Jack  had a most scandalous Tongue and persuaded  Peg  that all Mankind besides himself were pox'd by that scarletfac'd Whore  Signiora Bubonia  As for his Brother Lord  Peter  the Tokens were evident in him Blotches Scabs and the Corona His Brother  Martin  though he was not quite so bad had some nocturnal Pains which his Friends pretended were only Scorbutical but he was sure proceeded from a worse Cause  By such malicious Insinuations he had possess'd the Lady that he was  the only Man in the World of a sound pure and untainted Constitution Tho' there were some that stuck not to say that  Signiora Bubonia  and  Jack  rail'd at one another only the better to hide an Intrigue and that  Jack  had been found with  Signiora  under his Cloak carrying her home in a dark stormy Night  Jack  was a prodigious Ogler he would Ogle you the outside of his Eye inward and the White upward  Jack  gave himself out for a Man of great Estate in the Fortunate Islands of which the sole Property was vested in his Person by this Trick he cheated abundance of poor People of small Sums pretending to make over Plantations in the said Islands but when the poor Wretches came there with  Jack  's Grant they were beat mock'd and turn'd out of Doors I told you that  Peg  was whimsical and lov'd any thing that was particular In that way  Jack  was her Man for he neither thought spoke dress'd nor acted like other Mortals He was for your bold Strokes he rail'd at Fops tho' himself the most affected in the World instead of the common Fashion he would visit his Mistress in a Mourning Cloak Band short Cuffs and a peaked Beard He invented a way of coming into a Room backwards which he said shew'd more Humility and less Affectation where other People stood he sat where they sat he stood when he went to Court he us'd to kick away the State and sit down by his Prince Cheek by Choul  Confound these States  says he  they are a modern Invention  when he spoke to his Prince he always turn'd his Br  ch upon him if he was advis'd to fast for his Health he would eat Roast beef if he was allow'd a more plentiful Diet then he would be sure that Day to live upon Watergruel he would cry at a Wedding laugh and make Jests at a Funeral He was no less singular in his Opinions you would have burst your sides to hear him talk Politicks  All Governments says he is founded upon the right Distribution of Punishments decent Executions keep the World in awe for that Reason the Majority of Mankind  ought to be hang'd every Year for Example I suppose the Magistrate ought to pass an irreversible Sentence upon all blueey'd Children from the Cradle but that there may be some shew of Justice in his proceeding these Children ought to be Train'd up by Masters appointed for that purpose to all sorts of Villany that they may deserve their Fate and the Execution of them may serve as an Object of Terror to the rest of Mankind  As to the giving of Pardons he had this singular Method That when these Wretches had the Ropes about their Necks it should be enquired who believ'd they should be hanged and who not The first were to be Pardon'd the last hang'd outright Such as were once pardon'd were never to be hang'd afterwards for any Crime whatsoever He had such Skill in Physiognomy that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a Mans Face That Fellow says he do what he will can▪t avoid Hanging he has a hanging Look By the same Art he would prognosticate a Principality to a Scoundrel He was no less particular in the Choice of his Studies they were generally bent towards exploded Chimera's the  perpetum Mobile  the circular Shot Philosopher's Stone and silent Gunpowder making Chains for Flea's Nets for Flies and Instruments to unrevel Cobwebs and split Hairs Thus I think I have given you a distinct Account of the Methods he practis'd upon  Peg  Her Brother would now and then ask her  What a Devil dost thou see in that pragmatical Coxcomb to make thee so in Love with him He is a fit Match for a Tailor or a Shoemaker's Daughter but not for you that are a Gentlewoman Fancy is free quoth  Peg  I'll take my awn way do you take yours I do no care for your flaunting Beaus that gang with their Breasts open and their Sarks over their Waistcoats that accost me with set Speeches out of  Sidney  's  Arcadia  or  The Academy of Compliments Jack  is a sober grave Youngman tho' he has none of your study'd Harangues his Meaning is sincere He has a great Regard  to his Father's Will and he that shews himself a good Son will make a good Husband besides I know he has the Original Deed of Conveyance to the Fortunate Islands the others are Counterfeits  There is nothing so obstinate as young Ladies in their Amours the more you Cross them the Worse they are  CHAP IV How the Relations reconcil'd  John  and his Sister  Peg  and what return  Peg  made to  John's  Message  JOHN BULL  otherwise a good natur'd Man was very hardhearted to his Sister  Peg  chiefly from an Aversion he had conceived in his Infancy While he flourish'd kept a warm House and drove a plentiful Trade poor  Peg  was forc'd to go hawking and pedling about the Streets selling Knives Scissars and Shoebuckles now and then carry'd a Basket of Fish to the Market sow'd spun and knit for a poor Livelihood till her Fingersend were sore and when she could not get Bread for her Family she was forc'd to hire 'em out at Journeywork to her Neighbours Yet in these her poor Circumstances she still preserv'd the Air and Mien of a Gentlewoman a certain decent Pride that extorted Respect from the haughtiest of her Neighbours when she came into any full Assembly she would not yield the  pas  to the best of them If one ask'd her Are not you related to  John Bull  Yes says she he has the Honour to be my Brother So  Peg  's Affairs went till all the Relations cry'd out shame upon  John  for his barbarous Usage of his own Flesh and Blood that it was an easie matter for him to put her in a credible way of living not only without Hurt but with Advantage to himself being she was an industrious Person and might be serviceable to him in his way of Business Hang her Jade quoth  John  I can't endure her as long as she keeps that Rascal  Jack  's Company They told him the way to reclaim her was to take her into his House that by Conversation the childish Humours of their younger days might be worn out These Arguments were enforc'd  by a certain Incident It happen'd that  John  was at that time about making his Will and entailing his Estate the very same in which  Nic Frog  is nam▪d Executor Now his Sister  Peg  's Name being in the Entail he could not make a thorough Settlement without her Consent There was indeed a malicious Story went about as if  John  's last Wife had fall'n in love with  Jack  as he was eating Custard a Horseback that she perswaded  John  to take his Sister  Peg  into the House the better to drive on her Intrigue with  Jack  concluding he would follow his Mistress  Peg  All I can infer from this Story is that when one has got a bad Character in the World People will report and believe any thing of them true or false But to return to my Story when  Peg  receiv'd  John  's Message she huff'd and storm'd like the Devil  My Brother  John  quoth she is grown wondrous kind hearted all of a suddain but I meikle doubt whether it be not mair for his awn Conveniency than my good he draws up his Weits and his Deeds forsooth and I mun set my Hand to them unsight unseen I like the young Man he has settled upon well enough but I think I ought to have a valuable Consideration for my Consent He wants my poor little Farm because it makes a Nook in his Park Wall ye may e'en tell him he has mair than he makes good use of he gangs up and down drinking roaring and quarrelling through all the Countrey Merkats making foolish Bargins in his Cups which he repents when he is sober like a thriftless Wretch spending the Goods and Gear that his ForeFathers won with the Sweat of their Brows light come light go▪ he cares not a Farthing But why should I stand Surety for his silly contracts the little I have is free and I can call it my own Hame's hame be it never so hamely I ken him well enough he could never abide me and when he has his ends he'll e'en use me as he did before I'm sure I shall be treated like a poor Drudge I shall be set to tend the Bairns darn the Hose and mend the Linnen Then there's no  living with that auld Carline his Mother she rails at  Jack  and  Jack  's an honester man than any of her Kin I shall be plagu'd with her Spells and her  Paternosters  and silly auld warld Ceremonies I mun never pair my Nails on a Friday nor begin a Journy on  Childermas day  and I mun stand becking and binging as I gang out and into the Hall Tell him he may e'en gan his get I'll have nothing to do with him I'll stay like the poor Country Mouse in my own Habitation  So  Peg  talkt but for all that by the Interposition of good Friends and by many a bonny thing that were sent and many more that were promis'd  Peg  the matter was concluded and  Peg  taken into the House upon certain Articles one of which was That she might have the Freedom of  Jack  's Conversation and might take him for Better and for Worse if she pleas'd provided always he did not come into the House at unseasonable Hours and disturb the Rest of the Old Woman  John  's Mother  CHAP V Of some Quarrels that happen'd after  Peg  was taken into the Family  IT is an old Observation that the Qnarrels of Relations are harder to reconcile than any other Injuries from Friends fret and gall more and the Memory of them is not so easily obliterated This is cunningly represented by one of your old Sages called  Aesop  in the Story of the Bird that was griev'd extremely for being wounded with an Arrow feather'd with his own Wing as also of the Oak that let many a heavy Groan when he was cleft with a Wedge of his own Timber There was no Man in the World less subject to Rancour than  John Bull  considering how often his good Nature had been Abus'd yet I don't know but he was too apt to hearken to tatling People that carried Tales between him and his Sister  Peg  on purpose to sow Jealousies and set them together by the  ars They say that there were some Hardships put upon  that had been better let alone but it was the Business of good People to restrain the Injuries on  one side and moderate the Resentments on the other a good Friend acts both parts the one without the other will not do The PurchaseMoney of  Peg  's Farm was ill paid then  Peg  lov'd a little good Liquor and the Servants shut up the WineCellar but for that  Peg  found a Trick for she made a false Key  Peg's  Servants complain'd that they were debar'd from all manner of Business and never suffer'd to touch the least thing within the House if they offered to come into the Warehouse then strait went the Yard slap over their Noddle if they ventur'd into the CountingRoom a Fellow would throw an Ink bottle at their Head if they came into the best Apartment to set any thing there in order they were saluted with a Broom if they meddl'd with any thing in the Kitchen it was odds but the Cook laid them over the Pate with a Ladle one that would have got into the Stables was met by two Rascals who fell to work with him with a Brush and a Currycomb some climbing up into the Coach box were told that one of their Companions had been there before that could not drive then slap went the long Whip about their Ears On the other Hand it was complain'd that  Peg  's Servants were always asking for DrinkMoney that they had more than their share of the  Christmasbox  to say the Truth  Peg  's Lads bustl'd pretty hard for that for when they were endeavouring to Lock it up they got in their great Fists and pull'd out Handfuls of HalfCrowns some Shillings and Sixpences others in the Scramble pick'd up Guineas and Broadpieces But there happen'd a worse thing than all this it was complain'd that  Peg  's Servants had great Stomachs and brought too many of their Friends and Acquaintance to the Table that  John  's Family was like to be Eat out of House and Home Instead of regulating this Matter as it ought to be  Peg  's young Men were thrust away from the Table then there was the Devil and all to do Spoons Plates and Dishes flew about the Room like mad and Sir  Roger  who was now  Major Domo  had enough to do to quiet them  Peg  said this  was contrary to Agreement whereby she was in all things to be treated like a Child of the Family then she call'd upon those that had made her such fair Promises and undertook for her Brother  John  's good Be…haviour but alas to her Cost she found that they were the first and readiest to do her the Injury  John  at last agreed to this Regulation that  Peg  's Footme  might sit with his Bookkeeper Journeymen and Apprentices and  Peg  ▪s better sort of Servants might sit with his Footmen if they pleas'd  Then they began to orderPlumb Porridge and Minc'd Pies for  Peg  's Dinner  Peg  told them she had an Aversion to that sort of Food that upon forcing down a Mess of it some Years ago it threw her into a Fit 'till she brought it up again Some alledg'd it was nothing but Humour that the same Mess should be serv▪d up again for Supper and Breakfast next Morning others would have made use of a Horn but the Wiser sort bid let her alone and she might take to it of her own Accord  CHAP VI The Conversation between  John Bull  and his Wife  Mrs Bull  THO' our Affairs Honey are in a bad Condition I have a better Opinion of them since you seem to be convinc'd of the Ill Course you have been in and are resolv'd to submit to proper Remedies But when I consider your immense Debts▪ your foolish Bargains and the general Disorder of your Business I have a Curiosity to know what Fate or Chance has brought you into this Condition  J Bull  I wish you would talk of some other Subject the Thoughts of it make me mad our Family must have their run  Mrs Bull  But such a strange thing as this never happen'd to any of your Family before they have had Law Suits but tho' they spent the Income they never Mortgag'd the Stock Sure you must have some of the  or the  Norfolk  Blood in you prithee give me some Account of thse Matters  J Bull  Who could help it There lives not such a Fellow by Bread as that Old  Lewis Baboon  it is the cheatingest contentious Rogue upon the Face of the Earth You must know one Day as  Nic Frog  and I were over a Bottle making up an old Quarrel the old Knave would needs have us drink a Bottle of his  Champaigne  and so one after another till my Friend  Nic  and I not being used to such heady Stuff got bloody Drunk  Lewis  all the while either by the Strength of his Brain or Flinching his Glass kept himself sober as a Judge  My worthy Friends quoth  Lewis  henceforth let us live Neighbourly I am as peaceable and quiet as a Lamb of my own Temper but it has been my Misfortune to live among quarrelsom Neighbours There is but one thing can make us fall out and that is the Inheritance of Lord  Strutt  ▪s Estate I am content for Peace sake to wave my Right and submit to any Expedient to prevent a LawSuit I think an equal Division will be the fairest way Well mov'd Old  Lewis  quoth  Frog  and I hope my Friend  John  here will not be Refractory  At the same time he clap'd me on the Back and slabber▪d me all over from Cheek to Cheek with his great Tongue Do as you please Gentlemen quoth I 'tis all one to  John Bull  We agreed to part that Night and next Morning to meet at the Corner of Lord  Strutt  's Park Wall with our surveying Instruments which accordingly we did Old  Lewis  carried a Chain and a Semicircle  Nic  Paper Rulers and a Lead Pencil and I follow'd at some distance with a long Pole We began first with surveying the MeadowGrounds afterwards we measur'd the Corn Fields Close by Close then we proceeded to the WoodLands the Copper and Tin Mines All this while  Nic  laid down every thing exactly upon Paper calculated the Acres and Roods to a great Nicety When we had finish'd the Land we were going to break into the House and Gardens to take an Inventory of his Plate Pictures and other Furniture  Mrs Bull  What said Lord  Strutt  to all this  J Bull  As we had almost finish'd our Concern we were accosted by some of Lord  Strutt  's Servants  Hey day what's here What a Devils the meaning of all these Trangams and Gimcracks Gentlemen What in the name of Wonder are you go  ng about jumping over my Master's Hedges and running your Lines cross his Grounds If you are at any FieldPastime you might have ask'd leave my Master is a civil wellbred Person as any is  Mrs Bull  What could you Answer to this  J Bull  Why truly my Neighbour  Frog  and I were still hotheaded we told him his Master was an Old doating Puppy that minded nothing of his own Business that we were Surveying his Estate and settling it for him since he would not do it himself Upon this there happen'd a Qurrrel but we being stronger than they sent them away with a Flea in their Ear They went home and told their Master  My Lord say they there are three odd sort of Fellows going about your Grounds with the strangest Machines that ever we beheld in our Life I suppose they are going to Rob your Orchard fell your Trees or drive away your Cattle they told us strange things of settling your Estate One is a lusty old Fellow in a black Wig with a black Beard without Teeth there's another thick squat Fellow in TrunkHose the third is a little long Nos'd thin Man I was then Lean being just come out of a fit of Sickness I suppose it is fit to send after them lest they carry something away  Mrs Bull  I fancy this put the Old Fellow in a rare Tweag  John Bull  Weak as he was he call'd for his long  Toledo  swore and bounc'd about the Room  Sdeath what am I come to to be Affronted so by my Tradesmen I know the Rascals my Barber Clothier and LinnenDraper dispose of my Estate bring hither my Blunderbuss I'll warrant ye you shall see Daylight through them Scoundrels Dogs the Scum of the Earth  Frog  that was my Fathers Kitchenboy he pretend to meddle with my Estate with my Will Ah poor  Strutt  what art thou come to at last thou hast liv'd too long in the World to see thy Age  and Infirmity so despis'd How will the Ghosts of my noble Ancestors receive these Tidings They cannot must not sleep quietly in their Graves In short the Old Gentleman was carried off in a Fainting Fit and after bleeding in both Arms hardly recover▪d  Mrs Bull  Really this was a very extraordinary way of Proceeding I long to hear the rest of it  J Bull  After we had come back to the Tavern and taken t'other Bottle of  Champaigne  we quarrell'd a little about the Division of the Estate  Lewis  hall'd and pull'd the Map on one side and  Frog  and I on t'other till we had like to have tore the Parchment to pieces At last  Lewis  pull'd out a pair of great Taylor's Shears and clip'd off a Corner for himself which he said was a Mannor that lay convenient for him and left  Frog  and me the rest to dispose of as we pleas'd We were overjoy'd to think  Lewis  was contented with so little not smelling what was at the bottom of the Plot There happen'd indeed an Incident that gave us some Disturbance A Cunning Fellow one of my Servants two Days after peeping through the Keyhole observ'd that Old  Lewis  had stole away our part of the Map and saw him fiddling and turning the Map from one Corner to the other trying to join the two pieces together again He was muttering something to himself which he did not well hear only these Words  'Tis great Pity 'tis great Pity  My Servant added that he believ'd this had some illmeaning I told him he was a Coxcomb always pretending to be Wiser than his Companions  Lewis  and I are good Friends he's an honest Fellow and I dare say will stand to his Bargain The Sequel of the Story prov'd this Fellow's Suspicion to be too wellgrounded for  Lewis  reveal▪d our whole Secret to the Deceas'd Lord  Strutt  who in Reward to his Treachery and Revenge to  Frog  and me settled his whole Estate upon the present  Philip Baboon  Then we understood what he meant by piecing the Map together  Mrs Bull  And was you surpris'd at this Had not Lord  Strutt  reason to be Angry Would you have been contented to have been so us'd your self  J Bull  Why truly Wife it was not easily reconciled to the common Methods but then it was the Fashion to do such things I have read of your Golden Age your Silver Age  c  one might justly call this the Age of the Lawyers There was hardly a Man of Substance in all the Country but had  Counterfeit that pretended to his Estate As the Philosophers say that there is a Duplicate of every Terrestrial Animal at Sea so it was in this Age of the Lawyers there was at least two of every thing nay o' my Conscience I think there were three Esquire  Hackums  at one time  Lewis Baboon  entertain▪d a Fellow that call'd himself  John Bull  's Heir I knew him no more than the Child unborn yet he brought me into some Trouble and Expence There was another that pretended to be Esq  South  and two Lord  Strutts  you know In short it was usual for a parcel of Fellows to meet and dispose of the whole Estates in the Country  This lies convenient for me  Tom  Thou would do more good with that  Dick  than the Old Fellow that has it  ▪ So to Law they went with the true Owners the Lawyers got well by it every Body else was undone It was a common thing for an honest Man when he came Home at Night to find another Fellow domineering in his Family hectoring his Servants calling for Supper and pretending to go to Bed to his Wife In every House you might observe two  Sofia  's quarrelling who was Master For my own part I am still afraid of the same Treatment that I should find some Body behind my Counter selling my Broad Cloath  Mrs Bull  There are a sort of Fellows that they call Banterers and Bambouzlers that play such Tricks but it seems these Fellows were in earnest  J Bull  I begin to think that Justice is a better Rule than Conveniency for all some People make so slight on't  CHAP VII Of the hard Shifts Mrs  Bull  was put to to preserve the Mannor of  Bullock's Hatch  with Sir  Roger  's Method to keep off importunate Duns  AS  John Bull  and his Wife were talking together they were surpriz▪d with a sudden knocking at  the Door  those wicked Scriveners and Lawyers no doubt  quoth  John  and so it was some asking for the Money he ow'd and others warning to prepare for the approaching Term  What a cursed Life do I lead  ▪quoth  John    Debt is like deadly Sin for Godsake Sir  Roger  get me rid of these Fellows I'll warrant you  quoth Sir  Roger    leave them to me  And in eed it was pleasant enough to observe Sir  Roger  's Method with these importunate Duns his sincere Friendship for  John Bull  made him submit to many things for his Service which he would have scorn▪d to have done for himself Sometimes he would stand at the Door with his long Poll to keep off the Duns 'till  John  got out at the BackDoor When the Lawyers and Tradesmen brought extravagant Bills Sir  Roger  us'd to bargain before hand for leave to cut off a quarter of a Yard in any part of the Bill he pleased he wore a pair of Scissars in his Pocket for this purpose and would snip it off so nicely as you cannot imagine like a  Goldsmith he kept all your Holydays there was not one wanting in his Calendar when ready Money was scarce he would set them a telling a tho  Pounds and Sixpences Groats and Three pe  Pieces It would have done your Heart good to have seen him charge thro' an Army of Lawyers Attorney's Clerks and Tradesmen sometimes with Sword in Hand at other times nuzling like an Eel in the Mud When a Fellow stuck like a Bur that there was no shaking him off he  to be a mighty inquisitive about the Health of his Uncles and Aunts in the Country he could call them all by their Names for he knew every Body and could talk to them in their own way The extremely Impertinent he would send away to see some strange Sight as the Dragon at  Hockley the Hole  or bid him call the th of next  February  Now and then you would see him in the Kitchen weighing the Beef and Butter paying ready Money that the Maids might not run atick at the Market and the Butchers by bribing of them sell Damag▪d and Light Meat Another time he would slip into the Cellar and gage the Casks In his leisure Minutes he  was posting his Books and gathering in his Debts uch frugal Methods were necessary where Money was so scarce and Duns so numerous All this while  John  kept his Credit could show his Head both at  Change  and  WestministerHall  no Man protested his Bill nor refus'd his Bond only the Sharpers and the Scriveners the Lawyers and other Clerks pelted Sir  Roger  as he went along The Squirters were at it with their KennelWater for they were mad for the loss of their Bubble and that they could not get him to Mortgage the Mannor of  Bullocks Hatch  Sir  Roger  shook his Ears and nuzled along wellsatisfied within himself that he was doing a charitable Work in rescuing an honest Man from the Claws of  Harpies  and Bloodsuckers Mrs Bull did all that an affectionate Wife and a good Housewife could do yet the Boundaries of Virtues are indivisible Lines it is impossible to march up close to the Frontiers of Frugality without entering the Territories of Parsimony Your good Housewifes are apt to look into the minutest Things Therefore some blam'd Mrs Bull for new heelpiecing her Shoes grudging a quarter of a Pound of  Soap  and  Sand  to scowre the Rooms but especially that she would not allow her Maids and Apprentices the Benefit of  John Bunyan  the  LondonApprentice  or the  SevenChampions  in the Black Letter  CHAP VIII A Continuation of the Conversation betwixt  John Bull  and his Wife  Mrs Bull  IT is a most sad Life we lead my Dear to be so teaz'd paying Interest for Old Debts and still contracting new Ones However I don't blame you for vindicating your Honour and chastizing old  Lewis  to curb the Insolent protect the Opprest recover ones own and defend what one has are good Effects of the Law The only thing I want to know is how you came to make an End of your Money before you finish'd your Law Suit  John Bull  I was told by the Learned in the Law that my Suit stood upon three firm Pillars  More Mony for more Law more Law for more Mony and no  Composition  More Money for more Law was plain Demonstration for who can go to Law without Mony and it was as plain that any Man that has Mony may have Law for it The third was as Evident as the other two for what Composition could be made with a Rogue that never kept a Word he said  Mrs Bull  I think you are most likely to get out of this Labyrinth by the second Door by want of ready Money to purchase this precious Commodity But you seem not only to have bought too much of it but have paid too dear for what you have bought else how was it possible to run so much in Debt when at this very time the yearly Income of what is Mortgag'd to those Usurers would discharge  Hocus  's Bills and give you your Belly full of Law or all your Life without running one Six Pence in Debt You have been bred up to Business I suppose you can Cypher I wonder you never us'd your Pen and Ink  J Bull  Now you urge me too far prithee dear Wife hold thy Tongue Suppose a young Heir heedless raw and unexperienced full of Spirit and Vigour with a favourite Passion in the Hands of  Scriveners Such Fellows are like your Wire  Mills if they get hold of a Man's Finger  pull in his whole Body at last till they squeeze  Blood and Guts out of him When I wanted Mon  half a dozen of these Fellows were always waiting in my Antichamber with their Securities ready drawn I was tempted with the Ready some Farm or other went to Pot I receiv'd with one Hand and paid it away with the other to Lawyers that like so many Hell hounds were ready to devour me Then the Rogues would plead Poverty and Scarcity of Money that always ended in receiving Ninety for the Hundred After they had got Possession of my best Rents they were able to supply me with my own Mony But what was worse when I look'd into the Securities there was no Clause of Redemption  Mrs  Bull  No Clause of Redemption say you that's hard  John Bull  No great matter for I cannot pay them They had got a worse Trick than that the same Man bought and Sold to himself paid the Mony and gave the Acquittance The same Man was Butcher and Grasier Brewer and Butler Cook and Poulterer There is something still worse than all this there came twenty Bills upon me at once which I had given Mony to discharge I was like to be pull'd to Pieces by Brewer Butcher and Baker even my HerbWoman dun'd me as I went along the Streets thanks to my Friend Sir  R  ger  else I must have gone to Goal When I askd the meaning of this I was told the Mony went  to the Lawyers  Counsel won't tick Sir  Hocus  was urging my Bookkeeper sat Sotting all Day playing at Purt and Allfours In short by griping Usurers devouring Lawyers and negligent Servants I am brought to this pass  Mrs  Bull  This was hard usage but methinks the least reflection might have retriev'd you  J Bull  'Tis true yet consider my Circumstances my Honour was engag'd and I did not know how to get out besides I was for Five Years often Drunk always muddled they carried me from Tavern to Tavern to Alehouses and Brandyshops brought me acquainted with such strange Dogs  There goes the prittiest Fellow in the World  says one  for managing a Jury make him yours There's another can pick you up Witnesses Serjeant such a one has a Silver Tongue at the Bar  I believe in time I should have retain'd every single Person within the Inns of Court The Night after a Trial I treated the Lawyers their Wives and Daughters with Fiddles Hautboys Drums and Trumpets I was always hotheaded then they plac▪d me in the middle the Attorneys and their Clerks dancing about me hooping and hallowing  Long live  John Bull  the Glory and Support of the Law  Mrs  Bull  Really Husband you went through a very notable Course  John Bull  One of the things that first alarm'd me was that they shew'd a Spite against my poor Old Mother  Lord quoth I what makes you so Jealous  of a poor old innocent Gentlewoman that minds only her Prayers and her Practice of Piety she never meddles in any of your Concerns Foh say they to see a handsome▪ brisk genteel▪ young Fellow so much govern'd by a doating old Woman why don't yo and suck the Bubby Do you consider she keeps you of a good Jointure she has the best of your Estate settled upon her for RentCharge Hang her old Thief turn her out of Doors seize her Lands and let her go to Law if she dares Soft and fair Gentlemen quoth I my Mother's my Mother our Family are not of an unnatural Temper Tho I don't take all her Advice I won't seize her Jointure long may she enjoy it good Woman I don't grudge it her She allows me now and then a Brace of Hundreds for my LawSuit that's pretty fair  About this time the old Gentlewoman fell ill of an odd sort of a Distemper it began with a Coldness and Numbness in her Limbs which by degrees affected the Nerves I think the Physicians call them seiz'd the Brain and at last ended in a Lethargy It betray'd it self at first in a sort of Indifference and Carelesness in all her Actions Coldness to her best Friends and an Aversion to stir or go about the common Offices of Life She that was the cleanliest Creature in the World never shrunk now if you set a Closestool under her Nose She that would sometimes rattle off her Servants pretty sharply now if she saw them drink or heard them talk profanely never took any notice of it Instead of her usual Charities to deserving Persons she threw away her Money upon roaring swearing Bullies and randy Beggars that went about the Streets  What is the matter with the old Gentlewoman  said every Body  she nev  us'd to do in this manner  At last the Distemper grew more violent and threw her downright into ravi  Fits in which she shriek'd out so loud that she d  …sturb'd the whole Neighbourhood In her Fits  call'd out upon one Sir  William  Oh  Sir  William  hast betray'd me kill'd me stabb'd me sold me  Cuckold of  Dover  See see  Clum  with his bloody Kni  seize him seize him stop him Behold the the Fury  her hissing Snakes Where's my Son  John  is he well is he well poor Man I pity him  And abundance of such strange Stuff that no Body could make any thing of I knew little of the Matter for when I enquir'd about her Health the Answer was that  she was in a good moderate way  Physicians were sent for in haste Sir  Roger  with great difficulty brought  R  ff    G  th  came upon the first Message There were several others call'd in but as usual upon such Occasions they differ'd strangely at the Consultation At last they divided into two Parties one sided with  G  th  and the other with  R  ff Dr  G  th  This Case seems to me to be plainly Hysterical the Old Woman is Whimsical it is a common thing for your Old Women to be so I'll pawn my Life Blisters with the Steel Diet will recover her  Others suggested strong Purging and Letting of Blood because she was Plethorick Some went so far as to say the Old Woman was mad and nothing would do better than a little Corporal Correction  R  ff Gentlemen you are mistaken in this Case it is plainly an accute Distemper and she cannot hold out three Days without she is supported with strong Cordials  I came into the Room with a good deal of Concern and ask'd them what they thought of my Mother  In no manner of Danger I vow to God  quoth  G  th    the Old Woman is Hysterical Fanciful Sir I vow to God I tell you Sir  says R  ff  she can't live three Days to an end unless there is some very effectual Course taken with her she has a Malignant Fever  Then Fool Puppy and Blockhead was the best Words they gave I could hardly restrain them from throwing the InkBottles at one another's Heads I forgot to tell you that one Party of the Physicians desir'd I would take my Sister  Peg  into the House to Nurse her but the Old Gentlewoman would not hear of that At last one Physician ask'd if the Lady had ever been us'd to take  Laudanum  her Maid answer'd not that she knew that indeed there was a  High German  LiveryMan of hers one  Van Ptschirnsooker  that gave her a sort of a Quack Powder The Physician desir'd to see it  Nay  says he  there is  Opium  in this I am sure  Mrs  Bull  I hope you examin'd a little into this Matter  John Bull  I did indeed and discover'd a great Mystery of Iniquity The Witnesses made Oath That they had heard some of the Liverymen frequently railing at their Mistress  They said She was a troublesome fiddle faddle old Woman and so ceremonious that there was no bearing of her They were so plagu'd with bowing and cringing as they went in and out of the Room that their Backs ach'd she us'd to scold at one for his dirty Shoes at another for his greasie Hair and not combing his Head Then she was so passionate and fiery in her Temper that there was no living with her she wanted something to sweeten her Blood that they never had a quiet Night's rest for getting up in the Morning to early Sacraments that they wish'd they could find some way or another to keep the old Woman quiet in her Bed  Such Discourses were often overheard among the Liverymen that the said  Van Ptschirnsooker  had undertook this Matter A Maid made Affidavit  That she had seen the said  Van Ptschirnsooker  one of the LiveryMen frequently making up of Medicines and administring them to all the Neighbours that she saw him one Morning make up the Powder which her Mistress took that she had the Curiosity to ask him whence he had the Ingredients They come says he from several Parts of de World dis I have from  Geneva  dat from  Rome  this White Powder from  Amsterdam  and the Red from  Edinburgh  but the chief Ingredient of all comes from  Turkey  It was likewise proved that the said  Van Ptschirnsooker  had been frequently seen at the  Rose  with  Jack  who was known to bea  an inveterate Spite to his Mistress That he brought  certain Powder to his Mistress which the Examina  believes to be the same and spoke the following Word  ▪  Madam here is grand Secret van de Warld my sweetni  Powder it does temperate de Humour despel de Wind  and cure de Vapour it lulleth and quieteth de Animal Sp  …rits procuring Rest and pleasant Dreams It is the infall  +ble Receipt for de Scurvy all Heass in de Bloodt and Br  ing  out upon de Skin It is de true Blood Stancher stopping all Fluxes of de bloodt If you do take dis you will never ail any ding it will Cure you of all Diseases  And abundance more to this purpose which the Examinant does not remember  John Bull  was interrupted in his Story by a Porter that brought him a Letter from  Nicholas Frog  which is as follows  CHAP IX A Copy of  Nic Frog's  Letter to  John Bull  John Bull  Reads    Friend John  WHat  lum is it that makes thee jealous of thy old Friend  Nicholas  Hast thou forgot how some Years ago he took thee out of the Spunging House  'Tis true my Friend  Nic  did so and I thank him but he made me pay a swinging Reck'ning  Thou begins now to repent the Bargain that thou wast so fond of and if thou durst would forswear thy own Hand and Seal Thou sayst that thou hast purchas'd me too great an Estate already when at the same time thou knowest I have only a Mortgage 'Tis true I have Possession and the Tenants own me for Master but has not Esquire  South  the Equity of Redemption  No doubt and will redeem it very speedily poor  Nic  has only Possession eleven Points of the Law  As for the Turnpikes I have set up they are for other People not for my Friand  John  I have order'd my Servant constantly to attend to  et thy Carriages through without paying any thing only I hope thou wilt not come too heavy laden to spoil my Ways Certainly I have just Cause of Offence against thee my Friend for supposing it possible that thou and I should ever quarrel What Hounsfoot is it that puts these Whims in thy Head Ten Thousand Last of Devils haul me if I don't love thee as I love my Life  No question as the Devil loves HolyWater  Does not thy own Hand and Seal oblige  to purchase for me till I say it is enough Are not  Words plain I say it is not enough Dost thou think thy Fri  nd  Nicholas Frog  made a Child's Bargain Mark the Words of thy Contract  tota pecunia  with all thy Money  Very well I have purchas'd with my own Money my Childrens and my Grand childrens Money is not that enough Well  tota pecunia  let it be for at present I have none at all He would not have me purchase with other Peoples Money sure since  tota pecunia  is the Bargain I think it is plain no more Money no more Purchase  And whatever the World may say  Nicholas Frog  is but a poor Man in comparison of the rich the opulent  John Bull  great Clothier of the Warld I have had many Losses six of my best Sheep were drown'd and the Water has come into my Cellar and spoil'd a Pipe of my best Brandy It would be a more friendly Act in thee to carry a Brief about the Country to repair the Losses of thy poor Friend Is it not evident to all the World that I am still hem'd in by  Lewis Baboon  is he not just upon my Borders  And so he will be if I Purchase a thousand Acres more unless he gets some Body betwixt them I tell thee Friend  John  thou hast Flatterers that persuade thee that thou art a Man of Business do not believe them If thou would'st still leave thy Affairs in my Hands thou should'st see how handsomly I would deal by thee That ever thou should'st be dazzled with the inchanted Islands and Mountains of Gold that old  Lewis  promises thee 'Dswounds Why dost thou not lay out thy Money to Purchase a Place at Court of honest  Israel  I tell thee thou must not so much as think of a Composition Not think of a Composition that's hard indeed I can't help thinking of it if I would Thou complainst of want of Money let thy Wife and Daughter burn the God Lace upon their Petticoats sell thy fat Cattle retrench but a Sirloin of Beef and a PeckLoaf in a Week from thy gormandizing Guts Retrench my Beef a Dog Retrench my Beef then it is plain the Rascal has an ill Design upon me he would starve me Mortgage thy Manor of  Bullocks Hatch  or Pawn thy Crop for Ten Year A Rogue Part with my Country Seat my Patrimony all that I have left in the World I▪ll see him hang'd first Why hast thou chang'd thy Attorney Can any Man manage thy Cause better for thee Very pleasant because a Man has a good Attorney he must never make an End of his LawSuit Ah  John    John  I wish thou knevvest thy ovvn Mind Thou art as fickle as the Wind I  tell thee thou hadst better let this Composition alone or leave it to thy Loving Friend  Nic Frog  CHAP X Of some extraordinary Things that pass'd at the  Salutation  Tavern in the Conference between  Bull    Frog    Esq  South  and  Lewis Baboon  Frog  had given his Word that he would meet the above mention'd Company at the Salutation to talk of this Agreement tho' he durst not directly break his Appointment he made many a shuffling Excuse one time he pretended to be seized with the Gout in his right Knee then he got a great Cold that had struck him deaf of one Ear afterwards two of his CoachHorses fell sick and he durst not go by Water for fear of catching an Ague  John  would take no Excuse but hurry'd him away Come  Nic    says he  let's go and hear at least what this old Fellow has to propose I hope there's no hurt in that Be it so  quoth  Nic but if I catch any harm woe be to you my Wife and Children will curse you as long as they live When they were come to the Salutation  John  concluded all was sure then and that he shou'd be troubled no more with Law affairs he thought every Body as plain and sincere as he was Well Neighbours quoth he let's now make an end of all Matters and live peaceably together for the time to come if every body is as well inclin'd as I we shall quickly come to the upshot of our Affair And so pointing to  Frog  to say something to the great surprize of all the Company  Frog  was seizd with a dead Palsy in the Tongue  John  began to ask him some plain Questions and hoop'd and hollow'd in his Ear  John Bull  Let's come to the Point  Nic  ' Who would'st thou have to be the Lord  Strutt  Would'st thou have  Philip Baboon    Nic  shook his head and said nothing  John Bull  Wilt thou then have Esquire  South  to be Lord  Strutt    Nic  shook his Head a second time  John Bull Then who the Devil wilt thou have say something or another Nic  open▪d his Mouth and pointed to his Tongue and cry'd A a a a which was as much as to say he could not speak  John Bull  Shall I serve  Philip Baboon  with  Broad cloth and accept of the Composition that he offers with the Liberty of his Parks and Fishponds Then  Nic  roar'd like a Bull O o o o If thou wilt not let me have them wilt thou take them thy self Then  Nic  grin'd cackled and laugh'd till he was like to kill himself and seem'd to be so pleas'd that he fell a frisking and dancing about the  oom  John Bull Shall I leave all this Matter to thy  anagement  Nic  and go about my Business  Then  Nic  got up a Glass and drank to  John  shaking him by the Hand till he had like to have shook his shoulder out of Joint  John Bull I understand thee  Nic  but I shall make thee speak before I go  Then  Nic  put his Finger in his Cheek and made him cry  Buck  which was as much as to say I care not a Farthing for thee  John Bull I have done  Nic  If thou wilt not speak I'll make my own Terms with old  Lewis  here  Then  Nic  loll▪d out his Tongue and turn'd up his Bumm to him which was as much as to say Kiss    John  perceiving that  Frog  would not speak turns to old  Lewis Since we cannot make this obstinate Fellow speak  Lewis  pray condescend a little to his Humour and set down thy meaning upon Paper  may answer it in another Scrap I am infinitely  quoth  Lewis    that it happens so unfortunately for playing a little at Cudgels t'other Day a Fellow has given me such a Rap over the Right Arm that I am quite Lame  have lost the Use of my Forefinger and Thumb so that I  hold my Pen  John Bull  That's all one let me  for you  Lewis  But I have a Misfortune that I  nnot read any bodies hand but my own  John Bull  Try what you can do with your Left Hand  Lewis  That's impossible it will make such a Scrawl that it will not be legible  As they were talking of this Matter in came Esquire  South  all drest up in Feathers and Ribbons stark staring mad brandishing his Sword as if he  ld have cut off their Heads crying  Room room  for the grand Esquire of the World the Flower of  quires What cover'd in my Presence I'll crush your  ouls and crack you like Lice  With that he had like to  ave struck  John Bull  's Hat into the Fire but  John    was pretty strong fisted gave him such a Squeeze  as made his Eyes Water He went on still in his mad Pranks  When I am Lord of the Universe the sun shall  and adore me Thou  Frog  shalt be my Bailiff Lewis my Taylor and thou  John Bull  shalt be my Fool  All this  Frog  laugh▪d in his Sleeve gave the Esquire  Noggan of Brandy and clap▪d him on the Back which made him ten times madder Poor  John  stood in amaze talking thus to himself  Well  John thou art got into rare Company One has a dumb Devil▪ t'other a mad Devil and the third a Spirit of Infirmity An honest Man has a fine time on▪t amongst such Rogues What art thou asking of them after all Some mighty Boon one would think Only to sit quietly at thy own Fireside 'Sdeath what have I to do with such Fellows John Bull  after all  Losses and Cr  sses can live better without them than they can without him Would to God I liv'd a thousand Leagues off them But the Devil's in't  John Bull  is in and  John Bull  must get out as well as be can  As he was talking to himself he observ▪d  Frog  and  Old Lewis  edgng towards one another to Whisper so that  John  was forced to sit with his Arms akimbo to keep them asunder Some People advis'd  John  to Blood  Frog  under the Ton  ue or take away his Bread and Butter which would certainly make him speak to give Esquire  South  Hellebore as for  Lewis  some were for emollient Poltass others for opening his Arm with an Incision knife  I could not obtain from Sir  Humphry  at this time a Copy of  John  ▪s Letter which he sent to his Nephew by the young  Necromancer  wherein he advises him not to eat Butter Ham and drink Old Hock in a Morning with the Esquire and  Frog  for fear of giving him a sour Breath  FINIS
