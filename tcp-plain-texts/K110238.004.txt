 ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  VOLUME IV  LONDON PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  MDCCXCII  ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  LETTER LXI  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  I AM caught Fairfax Spring guns and man traps have been set for me and I am legged Meshed Shot through the heart I have been their puppet They have led me with a string through my nose a fine dance From the farthest  part of all Italy here to London in order to tie me up Noose me with a wife And what is more strange I am thanking and praising and blessing them for it in spite of my teeth I swallow the dose as eagerly as if it had been prepared and sweetened by my own hand and it appears I have had nothing to do in the matter I am a mere automaton and as such they have treated me  Is it not cursed odd that I cannot be angry And yet when I recollect all this I really suspect I am not pleased Damn it To be made their convenient utensil To be packed up their very obedient jack in a bandbox and with a proper label on my back posted with other lumber from city to city over hills and seas to be taken out and looked  at and if not liked returned as damaged ware Ought I to sneak and submit to this Tell me will not the court of honour hoot me out of its precincts Will not the very footmen point after me with a"There goes the gentleman that miss had upon liking" Why it is not yet full two months since I was the very prince of high blooded noble sportsmen in the romantic manors domains coverts and coveys of Venus By what strange necromancy am I thus metamorphosed thus tamed  I feel myself a husband by anticipation I am become as pretty a modest wellbehaved sober sentimental gentleman as any you shall see on a summer's day I get phrases by rote and repeat them too I say "God bless you madam"  when the cat sneezes and mumble amen to grace after meat  I told you that I had my catechism to learn and what is worse it is not the questions and commands of good old mother church with all the chancemedley promises and vows of godfathers and godmothers made in my name For which by the bye I think both godfathers and godmothers are fools and knaves but I have the Lord knows how much more to learn than ever I supposed the most outrageous morality could have exacted And I am obliged to answer yes and no and I thank you kindly while my finger's ends are smoking tingling and aching under the stroke of the ferula Yes I Coke Clifton with my sweetmeats in one hand  and my hornbook in the other am whipped till I pule coaxed till I am quiet and sent supperless to bed if I presume to murmur  Why what the devil is the English of all this say you Clifton What does it mean My head is so full of it and I have it so all by rote myself that it had totally escaped me that every word I have uttered must be heathen Greek to you Nay I had forgotten to tell you we have changed the scene which now is London  And as for accidents by sea and land why we have had some of them too Frank Henley has again shewn his dexterity I could eat my fingers to think that he should hit upon a certain and safe mode of acting in a moment  of danger fooner than I But so it is He seems born to cross me We should all have been tossed into the sea and some of us certainly drowned at the very water's edge if we had not been alert He took the command upon himself as imperiously as if it were his by right indisputable and I saw no expedient but to obey or perhaps behold her perish For curse upon me if I know whether any other motive on earth could have induced me to act as his subordinate But as it was I did as he bid me and sat grinding my teeth at the helm while I saw him reap all the honour of taking her in his arms and after her the rest and landing them in safety If Fairfax you can conceive any anguish on earth more excruciating than this why  tell it and you shall be appointed headtormentor to the infernal regions for your ingenuity  What was I going to sayMy brain is as murky as the clouds under which I am writingOhI recollectShe had no hand in spreading the trammel into which buzzard like I have been lured It was the scheme of my very good and careful mother for which I have been very sincerely writing her a letter with more thanks than words and of the wise Sir Arthur who wise though he be is not one of the magi She knew nothing of it for some time nor would have known but for my communicative sister and as she scorns deception for by my soul she scorns every thing that is base or derogatory it was  she who informed me of the trap in which I have been taken of which otherwise perhaps I might have remained in eternal ignorance  But still and once again say you what trap What do you mean  Three words will explain the whole  I have been brought from Naples to Paris not as I supposed to settle a few paltry debts of a deceased uncle but to see fall in love with and be ribhooked to this angel This my good mother as I understand thinks the kindest act of her lifeNay I think so too and yet I am not satisfied And merely I suppose because I feel I have been tricked I will not be the gull of man or woman What is it to me that they mean me well I will judge for myself  It is insolent in any one to pretend to know what befits me better than I myself know  In short I would quarrel and bounce and curse a little if I knew howBut they offer an apology so ample so irresistible that there is no demanding to exchange a short they present Anna St Ives as their excuse and a fico for resentment  And now there is nothing on earth for which I so earnestly wish as to be yoked What think you Fairfax shall I bear my slavish trappings proudly Shall I champ upon the bit and prance and curvet and shew off to advantage I doubt I shall stand in need of a little rough riding And yet I know not let her but pat me on the neck and  whisper two or three kind epithets in my ear and she will guide me as she pleases at least she does No Hopes there are none of my ever again returning to my native wilds and delightful haunts Never was seen so fond a booby as I am and am likely to remain  Nor do I believe I should grumble had she not such a superabundance of discretion She smiles upon me it is true is all gentleness all benevolence but then she does just the same to every body else For my part I see no difference except that I sometimes think she has a kinder smile for Frank Henley than she ever yet had for me But he is just as discreet as herself so that it seems impossible to be jealous  Yet jealous I am Ay and jealous I should be of my cat if she were as ready to purr and rear her back to be stroked by every coarse unwashed hand as by mine  Is it not a cursed shame that when you feel a continual propensity to quarrel with a man he should be such a prince Prim as never to give you an opportunity And why have I this propensityI know notConfound the fellow why does he make himself so great a favourite Why does he not contrive to be hated a little And then perhaps I might be induced to love him I dislike to have friendship or affection forced upon me as a duty I abhor duties as I do shackles and dungeons Let me do what I like I leave others to examine whether or no my conduct  be rational 'tis too much trouble for me  This marriage is never out of my head I wish for it sigh for it pray for it and dread it It may well be said there is no resistiong our destiny If I could but find out the key to her master passionWell What thenWhat do I want What do I hope To hope any thing short of the noose is mere madness Beside could I think of living without herNoI would be eternally in her company for she is eternal novelty she is all the world in one She is herself a million of individuals and not the stale dull repetition of the same which is so horrible to imagination  One thought has struck meShe has  the utmost confidence in what she calls the force of truth It cannot fail That is her constant language I am to be her first convert I have humoured this whim lately except when my irritable fancy breaks loose and runs riot If she have any folly it is this said confidence and whether it be one or be not is more than I have yet been able to determine But she has furnished me with an argument which I might carry to I know not what extent "You" I urge to her  you need not act with the timid and suspicious caution of your sex You are sure of your principle and to proceed with distrust and fear would prove doubt instead of certainty  She boldly repliesYes  she is sure and therefore she speaks and behaves with all that undisguise and sincerity which are so uncommon in the world and which some would deem so blameable  She says true she rises totally superior to the petty arts and tricks of her sex I seem to participate the trust which she reposes in herself and the confidence which she appears to place in me when she so openly declares all she thinks and all she means is highly pleasing But if my views were different from what they are I doubt whether madam Confidence might not be brought to lull madam Caution so fast asleep at some lucky moment or another as to suffer me to purloin her key and afterward to  rob her of all her treasure Nor should I fail under certain circumstances to try the experiment  Neither is that intriguing spirit which has so long been in restless habits of continual pursuit entirely idle My first care as usual was to secure the primeminister of my charmer whose name is Laura The hussey is handsome cunning and not without ambition An occasional guinea and a few warm kisses when it was certain that all was safe for caution is necessary have bound her to me The poor fool is fond of me and often finds some ingenious chambermaid's excuse to pay me a visit It does not appear that I shall need her agency otherwise here she is properly prepared to be wholly at my devotion Anna  St Ives affords the fancy full employment with any other woman an amour without plot and stratagem attack and defence would be too insipid to be endured  Not but I sometimes find my conscience reproach me for suffering such active talents as mine to lie concealed and unknown being as they are capable of acquiring renown so high When in Italy having even there in that land of artifice rendered myself the superior of all competitors I used to glory in the havoc I should make on my return to England But this the will of fate opposes at least for the present and of what duration my honeymoon is to be is more than any prescience of mine can discover  Write Fairfax and tell me freely your opinion of all this only remember that if you make your calculations and conclusions from any comparison with woman whom you have ever yet seen they will be all error Tell me however what you think and all you think  I forgot to say that twenty thousand pounds is the sum to be paid me down for condescending to accept this jewel I am informed it is wanted to pay off I know not what encumbrances and arrearsPshawI care notI have never yet troubled myself about wants nor do I wish to begin My father lived fast and died soon Well And is not that better than croaking and crawling over this dirty globe haunted by razors halters and barebones sobbing in your  sleep groaning when awake vegetating in sorrow and dying in the sulks Let me kick my heels in mirth and sunshine Or if clouds intervene let pleasure and fancy create suns of their own Those who like them may find gloom and November enough any day in the year Tell me Fairfax may they not Write and tell me  C CLIFTON  LETTER LXII  SIR ARTHUR ST IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY  London Grosvenor Street  HONEST ABY  WE are once more arrived in England for which I am not sorry Though I cannot say that I repent my journey into France My former suspicions are confirmed I had visited the country before but at that time my taste was not  formed I did not then understand laying out and improving as I do at present I had heard that the French had begun to imitate our best gardens tolerably well but I have seen some of those that are in most fame and what are they to WenbourneHillNo no AbyI am now convinced that as they say of their Paris there is but one WenbourneHill  I do not know when the family will return to the country The young people wish to enjoy the diversions and pleasures of the town and I rather suppose we shall stay here all the winter Perhaps we may take a jaunt or two between this and the meeting of parliament Not that any such plan is yet settled And as for me I shall be down with  you occasionally as affairs shall require I shall take great delight in once again treading over all my grounds and walks and dells and in visiting places that are never out of my mind  I cannot forget the hermitage and the grotto and the wilderness of which the moment you mentioned them I had formed so charming and so excellent a plan The picture clings to me as it were and it grieves me to give it up But so it must be  However as I say I shall come down more than once and for my part I wonder how these young unthinking people can prefer the dirty streets of London to all the delights and riches of nature and of art which may be said to  be waiting for and inviting them at WenbourneHill  I am very glad to find honest Abimelech that money is so certainly to be had But you were always intimate with the warm old fellows that provide themselves plentifully with what you so aptly call the wherewithalls You have followed their example and learned to increase your own store I am glad of it and am pleased to find you do not forget your first and best friends I must own Abimelech that you have always appeared to me to understand your situation very properly and to pay respect where it was due I have seen your proud upstart stewards carry their heads as high as their masters Ay and instead  of studying their tempers and humouring them as it was their duty have been surly and always ready with their ifs and ands and objections and advice As if it were any concern of theirs what a gentleman shall please to do with his money But you Aby have known how to comport yourself better of which I believe you have no cause to repent  As to the entail as you say it must be docked I know no remedy And since my son is so positive and determined to stickle for a good bargain why we must do the best we can  I was once sorry at his resolving never to marry but I think that is partly over now I care little about the matter My daughter's son will be as much my grandchild as his son would have been and as  for names they may easily be changed I am certain were any body to ask me which is the wisest my son or my daughter I should not stop a moment to consider about that  Ay ay She is my own child Every body used to tell me when she was a baby how like me she was  She has some of her mother's features too who as you well know Aby was a very good sort of an excellent kind of a lady and very much respected ay very much Indeed the greatest fault of Lady St Ives was that she would not always be of my opinion But we are none of us perfect If it were not for that one thing I really should think my daughter a young lady of more good sense and good taste and indeed every  thing of that kind than any young person I was ever acquainted with but she too is a declared enemy to planning and improving It is very strange and I can only say there is no accounting for these things  My son however knows as little of the matter as she does nay I believe less And as to other kinds of knowledge he is a child to her It delights me to hear her talk and debate points and chop logic with your Frank who is one of her own sort and with Mr Clifton the young gentleman whom I intend for my son in law I gave you an account in my last Aby that the thing was in expectation and it is now as good as concluded I have written to Mrs Clifton the lawyer is ordered to make a  rough sketch of marriage articles and every thing will be got ready while my attorney is preparing the necessary deeds down in the country according to your instructions and you are raising the money  Be sure however honest Aby to make as good a bargain for me as you can I know money is not to be had without paying for it and I trust to you not to suffer me to pay too dearly Better security you know Aby cannot be offered and I begin to feel my improvements excepted which indeed I hold to be inestimable that I am not so rich as I was fifteen years ago But as my son means never to marry and as the families of Clifton and St Ives are to be united in one I have no doubt some  time or another before I die of seeing every thing retrieved though I grant there are heavy mortgages and other impediments to overcome  Pray has my son told you what sum he expects If not endeavour to learn and let me know Though on second thoughts you need not for I hear he is to be in town next week He must recollect the estate of eight hundred ayear of which he has lately taken such violent possession But he is a dissipated young man and recollects nothing but his pleasures  I always said Aby you were a man of sense and you are very right in thinking I cannot do too much for my daughter I hope to contrive to leave Wenbourne Hill her own It is a rich  spot And though she be an economist and no friend to what she thinks a waste of money in improvements yet I am sure at my request she will not be guilty of what I may well call sacrilege and pull down my temples and dedicated groves and relics of art and ruins nor as my son would destroy with a Gothic hand as the poet says and tear away beauties which it would rend my heartstrings not to suppose durable as I may say for ages I would have my name and my taste and my improvements be long remembered at Wenbourne Hill I delight in thinking it will hereafter be said  Ay Good old Sir Arthur did this Yonder terrace was of his forming These alcoves were built by him He raised  the central obelisk He planted the grand quincunx  And ah Aby if we could but add  He was the contriver of yonder charming wilderness  I then should die in peace  Let me beg good abimelech that you would write your thoughts in as plain and straight forward a manner as you can for I assure you I have been very much puzzled with some parts of your last letter which I cannot yet say that I understand In some places it is very plain that you hint at Mr Clifton and wish me not to dally with him and as I know you have my interest at heart and speak in a style at which no gentleman can be offended why I rather thank than blame you for your desire to give good advice Though I must say Aby  that I do not think I have any need of it I am mistaken if I could not advise others I wish all the world would be governed by my plans and principles That's a favourite word with my daughter Aby and a very apt one  I once took some delight in such things I mean in what is called polite learning Aby Indeed I was remarkably fond of Ovid's Metamorphoses But then as I did not like to puzzle myself with the Latin I read Garth's or Rowe's or Pope's or I don't know whose translation And I do believe it was that and a visit to Lord Cobham's which first made me study taste and improvement Nothing is wanting but riches Aby to proceed to much greater lengths than any we have yet thought of  What richness of imagination is there in Ovid What statues might we form from the wonderful tales which he relates Niobe at the head of the canal changing into stone To be sure we should want a rock there Then on one side Narcissus gazing at himself in the clear pool with poor Echo wither+ing away in the grove behind King Cygnus in the very act of being metamorphosed into a swan on the other It would be so apropos you know a swan and a canal and king Cygnus And then at the further end Daphne with her arms and legs sprouting into branches and her hair all laurel leaves  You cannot imagine Aby all the fancies which came into my head the other day when I happened to lay my  hand on Tooke's Pantheon which brought all these old stories fresh to memory  But as I was saying good Aby write your thoughts as plainly as you can for I sometimes did not know whom you were talking of and there were one or two places which made me think you wish something should be done for your son Frank And indeed he is a very deserving and a very fine young fellow and I have been thinking it would not be amiss since he has really made himself a gentleman if we were to purchase him an ensign's commission What say you to it honest Aby He would make a fine officer A brave bold figure of a man And who knows but in time he might come to be a general ay and  command armies For he fears nothing He has lately saved us a dipping nay and for aught I know a drowning too and we really should do something for him for he is a great favourite and a very good young man However I thought it best to mention the matter first to you and will expect your answer  A ST IVES  LETTER LXIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  I MUST write dear Louisa My heart feels as if it were estranged by silence and thinks it has a thousand things to repeat though when it comes to enquire what they seem as if they had all vanished Not but I have a  little incident to relate which interests us both the Dramatis Personae being as usual Clifton Frank Henley and the friend of my Louisa  We yesterday paid a visit to my aunt Wenbourne at her summer villa of Richmond But I ought to premise that I am sorry to see Clifton again looking on Frank Henley with uneasiness and a kind of suspicion that might almost be called jealousy  Having consulted Sir Arthur I mentioned it as a pleasant excursion to Clifton and added as soon as Frank Henley should come I would desire him to hold himself in readiness Sir Arthur was present and Clifton in a pouting kind of manner whispered me  Can we never go any where  without that young fellow dogging us at the heels  I smiled it off rapped him on the knuckles with my thimble told him he was naughty and said we must not suffer merit to think itself neglected Clifton began to sing Britons strike home which he soon changed to Rule Britannia sure tokens that he was not pleased for these are the tunes with which he always sings away his volatile choler But one of the columns on which I raise my system is a determination to persist in the right Frank Henley was therefore invited and accompanied us  Clifton endeavoured to pout but as I did not in the least change my good humour knowing how necessary it was rather to increase than diminish it he  could not long hold out and soon became as cheerful and as good company as usual and his flow of spirits and whimsical combinations are very exhilarating  After dinner my good old aunt presently got to wordy wars with Frank in which as you may suppose she had little chance of victory But she called in Clifton to be her auxiliary and he fell into the same pettish halfhaughty halfcontemning kind of manner in which he had so improperly indulged previous to the accident of the lake in France I looked at him he understood me and endeavoured but rather awkwardly to change his tone  The conversation continued and he was again becoming warm and while  Frank was laying down the law to my aunt at which I could perceive his tongue tingled I took an opportunity to warn him to beware for that I had more than one crow to pluck with him already  However as the best and securest mode was from the temper of the parties to put an end to the conversation I rose and proposed a walk and my proposal was accepted  I was particularly cautious to say as little to Frank as I could purposely that Clifton might have no retort upon me though a part of my plan is to accustom him to see me just to the merits of Frank without indulging any unworthy suspicions But this I did not think a fit occasion for such experiments  We returned to town and I purposed when Clifton should come to pay me his morning visit next day to read him a gentle lecture Of this he was aware and feeling as I suppose that he should make a bad serious defence knew a comic one would better serve his turn for his fancy and humour appear to be inexhaustible  The first thing he did when he entered the room was to fall down on his knees like a child to his schoolmistress holding his hands pressed flatly together with a piteous face and a "Pray pray" I laughed and told him he was a very bad child His "Pray pray" was repeated with another strangely pleasant contortion of countenance But I still answered"No indeedI should not  forgive him till I had made him truly sensible of his fault" On which he rose from his knees pulled out a paper fool's cap which he had been carving and fashioning for himself fixed it on his head and placed himself with a new kind of penitential countenance in a corner continuing such quaint mimickry of a child in sorrow that there was no resisting fair and downright laughter  I still made two or three attempts to begin to argue but they were ineffectual they were all answered with some new antics and I was obliged at last to say  Well well I find you are sensible how much you deserve punishment and therefore I dare say you will take care not to offend in future  After this he gave the whole discourse a comic and a witty cast embellishing it with all the flights of his rich and strong imagination on purpose to avoid the possibility of remonstrance This is a certain sign that it must be very painful to him unless indeed we allow for the pleasure which he cannot but take in exhibiting the activity of his mind Yet painful I am sure it is Contradiction is a thing to which he has not been accustomed He has no doubt led the opinions of his companions partly by conforming to and strengthening their favourite prejudices though chiefly by his superior talents and to be too often encountered by any one whose intellects are more clear and consistent than his  own is a kind of degradation to which he scarcely knows how to submit  With respect to Frank Henley whenever he is pleading the cause of truth he is inflexible I have sometimes indeed known him silent when he was hopeless of doing good but at others I have heard him blame himself for this and assert that we never ought to despair for that truth no matter how violently opposed at the moment would revive in the mind and do her office when the argument and the anger should be wholly forgotten  I believe the observation to be just But he is no common thinker No I am almost persuaded he is the first of human beings Equal nay I have sometimes  even thought superior to Louisa herself  As you perceive dear friend of my heart that I know you too well to fear offending you I am sure you will do me the justice at the same time to confess that I do not seek to flatter  Thus dear Louisa you perceive we do not perhaps make quite so swift a progress as we could wish but we must be satisfied The march of knowledge is slow impeded as it is by the almost impenetrable forests and morasses of error Ages have passed away in labours to bring some of the most simple of moral truths to light which still remain overclouded and obscure How far is the world at present from being convinced that it is not only possible but perfectly  practicable and highly natural for men to associate with most fraternal union happiness peace and virtue were but all distinction of rank and riches wholly abolished were all the false wants of luxury which are the necessary offspring of individual property cut off were all equally obliged to labour for the wants of nature and for nothing more and were they all afterward to unite and to employ the remainder of their time which would then be ample in the promotion of art and science and in the search of wisdom and truth  The few arts that would then remain would be grand not frivolous not the efforts of cunning not the prostitution of genius in distress to flatter the vanity of insolent wealth and power or the depraved  taste of an illjudging multitude but energies of mind uniting all the charms of fancy with all the severe beauties of consistent truth  Is it not lamentable to be obliged to doubt whether there be a hundred people in all England who were they to read such a letter as this would not immediately laugh at the absurd reveries of the writerBut let them look round and deny if they can that the present wretched system of each providing for himself instead of the whole for the whole does not inspire suspicion fear disputes quarrels mutual contempt and hatred Instead of nations or rather of the whole world uniting to produce one great effect the perfection and good of all each family is itself a state bound to  the rest by interest and cunning but separated by the very same passions and a thousand others living together under a kind of truce but continually ready to break out into open war continually jealous of each other continually on the defensive because continually dreading an attack ever ready to usurp on the rights of others and perpetually entangled in the most wretched contentions concerning what all would neglect if not despise did not the errors of this selfish system give value to what is in itself worthless  Well wellAnother century and then  In the mean time let us live in hope and like our worthy hero Frank not be silent when truth requires us to speak  We have but to arm ourselves with patience fortitude and universal benevolence  Pardon this prattleThe heart will sometimes expand and it is then weak enough to plead that the effusions of friendship claim attention and respect This is among the prejudices of our education and I know not who has hitherto overcome them all I can only say dear Louisa it is not her who is most affectionately your  A W ST IVES  P S  Clifton is quite successful with my relations he has won the heart of my aunt Every moment that he was absent was lavished in his praise  He was a handsome man prodigiously  handsome exceedingly well bred a man of great understanding and what was more a man of family His pretensions were well founded it was a very proper connection and was very much approved by her  Nor did the good old lady omit various sarcastic hints glancing at Frank and which were not softened by the opposition he made to her opinions But he is too great a lover of truth to betray it for the sake of self and she too much an admirer of her own prejudices not to be offended at contradiction Once more Louisa we are the creatures that education has made us and consequently I hope we shall hereafter be wiser and better  LETTER LXIV  LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES  RoseBank  AN odd circumstance my dear Anna has happened here of which I think it necessary to inform you immediately  Honest Aby has again been with us He came and enquired for my mamma Disappointment chagrin and illhumour were broadly legible on his countenance  He talked in his odd dialect which I cannot remember accurately enough to repeat said he had just received a letter from Sir Arthur from which he understood something that to him appeared to be matter of great surprise which was that Sir Arthur intended to bestow your hand on my brother and in a half submissive half authoritative way wanted to know whether it were true and whether my mamma knew any thing of the business  She acknowledged that such were the intentions of the two families and he answered that for his part he thought they might as well think no more of the matter muttering the words  wherewithal  and  coal  Mrs Clifton desired him to be explicit  but he continued in half sentences repeating that the ready was not so easy to be had and rhino was a scarce commodity Neither could he tell what might happen There were foreclosures and docking of entails and many things to be settled and cash must come from where it could be got but not from him he believed  My mamma mild as she is was obliged to check his growling inclination to be insolent and then he had his whole beadroll of fine words with which he has so often tickled the ear of Sir Arthur at his tongue's end and ran them off with his usual gracious and very humble obedient volubility  Had I not received your last  Letter LVIII whence we may conclude that the letter immediately preceding this was not come to hand  his discourse would have been more enigmatical to me but as it was I understood him tolerably well The bitterness of gall is at his heart The greatness of his visible disappointment shews how high his hopes had been raised and I suspect he is determined they shall not be very easily pulled down For after having acted all his abject humility he could not forbear again to murmur over his threats as he was leaving the room and there was an air of selfsufficient confidence so apparent in his face that I am persuaded the obstacles he has the power to raise are much greater than you my dear friend have ever supposed  I cannot describe to you my best Anna how deeply my mind is agitated at times concerning this marriage I censure myself very severely for seeming to indulge improper fears one minute and perhaps the next am more angry with myself for not disinterestedly pleading the cause of Frank Henley If there could be a miracle in nature I should think his being the son of  honest Aby  one What can I say My doubts are too mighty for me I know not how or what to advise The reasons you have urged are indeed weighty yet they have never made an impression so deep upon my mind as not to take flight and leave their opponent arguments in some sort the victors  Nor can I be more angry with myself  on any occasion than I am at this moment I distress and trouble you with my fears when I ought to keep them to myself unless I could determine whether they were or were not well founded They are even increased by the recollection that in all probability Clifton could now much less bear disappointment than the strongminded and generous Frank  Then my Anna Should ill happen to her from an undertaking the motive of which is so worthy so dignified what should I say Should misfortune come how could I excuse myself for having neglected to dissuade and to urge such reasons as have appeared to me the strongest What could I say but rePeat the diffidence of my mind the want  of full and satisfactory conviction and the fear of mistake  The only buckler with which I oppose these insurrections of reason is the omnipotence of truth and Anna St Ives And when I recollect this my terrors are hushed and I think her sure of conquest  The very affirmative tokens which Aby displayed of his own consequence convince me however that there will be delay How Clifton will submit to it is to be seen His letter to my mamma is all impatience and expectation But I have talked with her and she appears to be determined that nothing can be done till Sir Arthur is ready to pay the sum he proposed  My Anna will not be very ready to  attribute this to avarice for no one can think more highly of her than Mrs Clifton does But my father at his death left the family in absolute distress from which she has retrieved it by her economy and good sense retrieved it that is in part for there are still many heavy debts to pay and mortgages to be cleared Her plans have been severe and of long continuance deeply thought on and perseveringly executed To convince her that any part of them ought to be relinquished scarcely appears possible Nor am I sure that obliged as we are to conform to the present system of things they are not all just Beside which she is not in a state of health to support the fatigue of argument or the pain of contradiction  She likewise considers Sir Arthur as a weak old gentleman who if this opportunity were abandoned would perhaps never have the spirit or the power hereafter to do his daughter justice and she thinks that for your sake she ought not in the least to relax Should you my dear Anna reason differently I am still certain that you will reason charitably  With respect to my brother it may perhaps be fortunate should the suspense afford you time for further trials and we may have cause to rejoice at the accident which had checked the precipitate impatience of passion  Though I expect a letter from you by tomorrow's post I think this of too much consequence to suffer any delay  I shall therefore seal it and send it off immediately  Heaven bless and eternally preserve my dear Anna  L CLIFTON  LETTER LXV  ABIMELECH HENLEY TO SIR ARTHUR ST

it is not half an hour since I ended writing one of the most undutiful and bitter Philippics that ever was addressed by a son to his father I say undutiful because this wise world has decreed that to abhor reprove and avoid  vice in a father instead of being the performance of a duty is offensive to all moral feeling  I have just received a letter from him chiding and blaming me with his usual acrimony for a supposed want of cunning and for not aiding him in what I perceive now to be the design he has most at heart which is my marriage with the divine Anna He has almost disgusted me with myself for having though ineffectually endeavoured to aid him so well Nay I have been tempted to shew his letter to Sir Arthur But on recollection I have thrown the Philippic I mentioned into the fire and have determined on silence for I perceive harm that may result from a contrary conduct but no good To swerve to the  right or the left from the direct path of principle and truth because of the selfish narrow and unwise views of others is to be weak and culpable  What indeed has relationship to do with truth No human ties can bind us to error and while we rigorously act according to the rules of truth as far as we know them the comments mistakes disapprobation and even resentment of relation friend or father ought to be disregarded  I must own however I have still the folly to feel additional grief that errors of so mean so selfish so dishonest a nature should have taken such firm possession of the mind of my father and I am afraid I could support them better in the person of another  Having determined not to write to him I have written to thee to give vent and relief to these feelings Of course thou wilt tell me if thou seest any reason which I have not discovered why I ought to communicate the contents of his letter to Sir Arthur whom he vaunts of having in his power and whom he is determined not to supply with money for the projected marriage with Clifton My conviction is that to shew this letter would but increase their mutual anger and render compliance on my father's part whose temper I know still less probable than it is if less it can be  Adieu  F HENLEY  LETTER LXVIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  I WRITE at present to my dear Louisa that by writing I may divert the perturbation of my mind But I must begin calmly for I have so much to say that I scarcely know what to say first Our mutual conjectures concerning honest Aby are in  part verified I conclude thus not from having seen any more of his letters but from knowing more have been received which instead of having been shewn me have if I do not mistake thrown Sir Arthur into some of the most serious reflections he ever experienced I never knew him so grave thoughtful and pensive as he has been for some days  My brother tooBut more of him by and by  Observing the efforts of reflection and desirous of aiding alleviating or increasing them as should be most prudent I took an opportunity after breakfast when Sir Arthur and I were alone of speaking to him and we had the following dialogue  I think sir you seem more thoughtful lately than usual I am afraid there is something disturbs you Can I  No noNothingNot much Worldly matters which you do not understand  I am far from wishing sir to intrude into your private concerns except they were such as might relate to me and  Mere money matters child of which you have no knowledgeWe paused Sir Arthur seeming as if his mind laboured with a subject which he knew not how to beginWhere is Mr Henley  Retired to his apartment sir This is his time of day for study  He is a very learned young man  Not so learned I believe sir as wise  Are not they the same thing  I think not sir  Well then a very wise young manYou think him so do you not Anna  I do sir  You have a very high opinion of him  I have sir  Perhaps a higher than of any other young gentleman with whom you are acquainted  I am indeed afraid sir I have never seen his equal  HumphYouYou are not sparing of your praise  You asked me a question sir and would not have me guilty of equivocation or falsehood  No child I am pleased with your sincerity and I hope and expect you  will be equally sincere in every thing you say  Of that sir you may be assured  What are your reasons for thinking so exceedingly well of Mr Henley  My reasons sir  Yes your reasons  I own I am a little surprised at this question from you sir who have been a witness to so many of his virtues and their effects  I then briefly recapitulated the progress of Frank from a child in virtue insisting on the numerous proofs of which we so lately had been witnesses I recounted the histories of the highwayman and of Peggy and her husband the adventure of the lake and the protection  we found from his skill strength and courage at Deal not forgetting the attendant incidents of each nor neglecting to give such brief but strong touches as feeling dictated  I must own he is a very extraordinary young man  Yet we can know but a part of the good effected by a mind so active and so virtuous Though I perhaps know more than you sir  AyWhat Let me hear  You think me partial already sir  No no Let me hear  The very night we arrived at Paris he prevented Mr Clifton and the Count de Beaunoir from fighting a duel  Indeed  Yet never mentioned it nor perhaps  ever would had not we afterward met with the Count at the Chateau de Villebrun  That was very odd  Nay more sir but a day or two before that he saved the life of Mr Clifton he had submitted to the insult of a blow from him rather than fight a duel  A blow  He does not want courage sir you are convinced  No noIt is what he calls one of his principles not to fight duelsHe is a very extraordinary young manAnd not I think much like his father  As opposite sir as day and night grace and deformity virtue and vice  You think but indifferently of Abimelech  I think very ill of him sir I think him selfish cunning covetous and dishonest  Dishonest  In the eye of equity though not perhaps of the law  Why did not you tell me your opinion sooner  I did sir  I do not remember it  No sir it made no impression because you did not think it true  May be soAnd you do not find any of these bad qualities in the son  BadIf all the highest gifts of intellect if memory perspicuity perception and genius added to all the virtues wisdom benevolence philanthropy and selfdenial if to be the active  friend of man and the declared enemy of error and of that alone if these can entitle him to esteem admiration reverence and praise why then esteem admiration reverence and praise are justly his due  You are warm in your encomiums  Indeed sir I think I am cold  How so  Because my encomiums are so very much beneath his deserts  AnnaSir Arthur assumed a very serious tone and look  Proceed sirDo not be afraid of questioning me You shall find my dear father a child that will answer truly affectionately and I hope dutifully  I kissed his hand pressed it and wet  it with an unwilling tear The impassioned heart Louisa will sometimes rebel against the cold apathy of reason but such revolt is but of short duration  Are you aware Anna of the state of your own affections  I think so sir  You think  Well then I am certain  You say Mr Henley has no equal  In my opinion none sir  Look you there  But do you think sir I will not emulate the virtues I admire or that because I have a just sense of his worth I will trespass against my duties to the world my sex my family and my father  AnnaChildThe tears stood in Sir Arthur's eyes He stretched out both hands and I flew to his armsAfter a short interval of silence Sir Arthur proceeded Tell me Anna What are your thoughts of Mr Clifton  I think him sir a very extraordinarily gifted gentleman  But not a Mr Henley  Not at present sir Time I hope will make him one  No child never  Why so sir  I cannot tell why but I am sure it never will They are two very different men  Mr Clifton sir has uncommon powers of mind  May be so I suppose so I only say  they are very different men Their tempers are different their opinions their manners every thing  I do not imagine sir they will ever exactly resemble each other but I think myself sure they will continually approach  Indeed  Yes sir  May be so but I own I doubt it Mr Clifton is a gentleman both by birth and education  That I own sir may be a great disadvantage but  Disadvantage child  Our conversation was here interrupted Louisa by a letter brought me from  my brother Read it and judge of what I felt  Dear Sister  I AM a ruined man unless I could command a sum of money which it is impossible for me to raise I last night lost three thousand pounds upon honour which I am totally unable to pay And what is worse I did not lose it to a gentleman but to a sharper who the very last throw he made let a third die fall upon the table But this is of no avail he is an unprincipled daring fellow denies any foul play with imprecations and threats and insists on being paid I know you cannot help me to such a sum and I suppose my father will not For my part I can neither pay it nor think of  living under the disgrace and infamy which must follow  EDWARD ST IVES  Sir Arthur saw my agitation and had I been desirous it would have been difficult to have concealed the letter or its contents I shewed it him and his perplexity and pain I believe exceeded mine It was impossible he said for him immediately to pay the money it would greatly distress him at any time It likewise shewed the deplorable state of my brother's affairs The Edgemoor estate every thing gone  Sir Arthur knew not how to act I was in a tremor and could not persuade myself there was any way so safe as that of consulting Frank Henley This I  proposed Sir Arthur instantly acquiesced and he was sent for down After reading the letter the only expedient he said which he could think of was to visit my brother either accompanied by or under the sanction of Sir Arthur My father absolutely refused to go himself but he gave Frank full powers to act for him and as he should think most prudent Before he went he endeavoured to calm our fears saying he thought it impossible if such a rascal as this gambler were properly dealt with but that he must be glad to renounce his claim  Frank is now absent on this desperate business sent by my officiousness to encounter a practised ruffian  What could I do A brother threatening  his own life Yet what is the life of such a brother to that of Frank Henley  I hope he is not in danger I think I was obliged to do as I have done though indeed I am very ill satisfied with myself  The chief purpose of my writing this long dialogue which I had with Sir Arthur was to ward off fears for surely it is but a folly to anticipate misfortune I should else not have written till tomorrow And must I alarm my friend by sending this before I know the result of so dangerous an affair I think I ought not  Clifton has just been with me It  could not long escape his quick penetration that my thoughts were deeply occupied He was earnest with me to accompany him in the evening to see Garrick in Richard III but could not prevail He taxed me with absence of mind and was kindly earnest to know why I was so serious I told him at last it was a family concern and this did but increase his eagerness to know of what nature I was obliged to own he was too impetuous to be trusted at such a critical minute Frank Henley I hoped would effect every thing that could be done  He repeated with great chagrin  Frank HenleyHe was sorry not to be thought as worthy of a trust of danger and as zealous for the honour  of the family as even the favourite Frank Henley  I replied my mind was not enough at ease to give a proper answer to such a remark which however was far from a just one  He felt the rebuke and apologized with praises of Frank Henley's prudence and accusations of his own intemperate haste  But wise people knew how to be cool Prudence and wisdom were cold blooded qualities Good or harm of any moment if done by him must be done in a kind of passion It was his temper his nature which he tried in vain to correct Neither was he quite certain that such a temper was not the best at least it was the most open and honest  I told him he was mistaken in most of these fancies but he seemed not to hear me and went on  He could not but own he was piqued and almost grieved to find he must despair of meriting the preference and that he was destined to find a rival where rivalship ought perhaps least to be expected  My temper of mind did not permit me to argue with him I could much rather have indulged the woman and burst into tears but I subdued my feelings and could think of no better mode of reproving him than to retire I accordingly withdrew without answering▪ and left him making ineffectual struggles with his pride his consciousness of error and his desire of being  heard and reconciled to himself and me  He told me yesterday he was surprised at not receiving an answer from Mrs Clifton and at the silence of Sir Arthur I made no reply because I had not considered how I could address myself to him with the best effect But I mean when he mentions it again to inform him of the probability of delay I like you my friend think delay rather a fortunate incident than otherwise  But why Louisa should you suppose it necessary to justify the conduct of Mrs Clifton to me I am well acquainted with her virtues and the purity of her intentions Whether I should act with exactly the same caution under the same circumstances is more than I can say  but neither can I say that my prudence and foresight would equal hersI think I hear Frank Henley I am all impatience and alarm Adieu  A W ST IVES  LETTER LXIX  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London GrosvenorStreet  FRANK has this moment left me He is still in pursuit of this business which is by no means brought to a conclusion He has been with my brother and has met the gambler with whom two very characteristic dialogues have passed  which Frank has repeated with considerable humour My brother was only present at and bore his part in the second The man is a perfect master of his vile trade a practised duellist as expert Frank says in killing of men as in cogging of dice A Hibernian bravo determined to pursue the most desperate means to effect his purpose  Energy in vice or virtue Frank remarks is the characteristic of the Irish It is a noble quality of which no nation perhaps has more if any so much but it is frequently abused by them and made productive of the most hateful effects  Frank was with my brother in his dressingroom when the man came and was shewn into an antichamber by the  servant Edward was sufficiently unwilling to see him and readily agreed to the proposal Frank made of first conversing with him as my brother's friend  Frank accordingly went to him and says he was struck at the sight of the man being much deceived if he be not an old acquaintance I was and still am surprised at what Frank told me but he begged I would suspend my curiosity till he himself should be better satisfied and proceeded with his dialogue  Your name I believe sir is Mr Mac Fane  At your sarvice sir  I am the friend of Captain St Ives  Then to be sure sir you are a gintleman and a man of honour I am a  gintleman and a man of honour mysilf  Do you say that from your conscience sir  From my conscience Ay sir Why not When all my debts due are duly and truly paid why I shall have ten thousand pounds in my pocket  There are people sir heretical enough to suppose that even ten thousand pounds are no absolute proof of honour  No indeedWhy then for those very scrupulous people I have an excellent pair of proof pistols which I believe are absolute enough Becase I would take the odds that they would hit a bird's eye flying  Those arguments I own are difficult to withstand  StandFaith and if any man shall think proper to stand I will fetch him downRemember Louisa I am imitating this man's language as delivered by Frank though I believe my memory is tolerably correct But I should be proud to speak a word with your friend because that will be more to the point  He requested me to inform you sir he should be glad if you would delay your visit an hour or two and I think it will be the safest for you I perceive sir are rather warm and his temper as you may imagine cannot be so cool just at present as usual  His temperFaith sir and the devil  a care care I about his temper And as for warm and cool I can be either or neither or both I have won the money and the Captain must pay it or else d'ye see sir  You'll hit the bird's eye flying  Ay flying or lying or any wayHowever I will take a turn and come back by and by I have two or three calls to make on some peers of my acquaintance I am a man of nice honour sir  And you imagine nice though it is that your honour is suspected  By my soul sir I imagine no such thing Becase as why I think it would not be very safe I tell you very seriously sir that I have a sure sacrit to cure any impartinent suspicions of my honour  as I beg you would inform your friend Captain St Ives who being a man of honour himsilf knows what belongs to the business These sir are tender points with every gintleman And so sir I wish you a good morning for the present  Frank says he was desirous of conversing with the man that he might discover his character previous to his concerting any plan of action  After he was gone he endeavoured to lead my brother into a discussion on the state of his affairs But Edward avoided all detail satisfying himself with affirming he was a ruined man and unable to pay the sum He had no objection to meet the fellow in the field though certainly the chances were a hundred to  one in his disfavour He might as well die that way as any other With respect to victory of that there were but little hopes with so expert a ruffian who had practised pistol shooting till he was sure of his mark which my brother had wholly neglected  Frank then enquired at what house the money had been lost and found it had been at one of the common receptacles for gamblers of the fecond order No person was present but the groom porter whom Frank immediately determined to see and went thither for that purpose But on enquiry at the house he found the man had absconded  He returned and had some difficulty to convince my brother that his honour would not suffer by delay for it was  plain that Mr Mac Fane was resolved on immediately pushing the matter to an extreme However on communicating his own conjectures concerning this man of nice honour Edward consented to permit Frank to act in his behalf Frank observes that our men of fashion seem agreed to overlook a portion of insolence from these gamblers under the affectation of despising them which the tamest of the fine gentlemen among them would scarcely brook from each other  In about two hours Mr Mac Fane returned and being introduced to my brother and Frank another conversation very similar to the former ensued The man began  Your servant gintlemen I told you  last night Captain that I would give you a call this morning and as it is an affair in which your honour is concerned why I was determined to be very punctual Becase why you know I am extremely nice and punctual mysilf upon points of honour  I am sorry to be obliged to tell you sir that Captain St Ives neither knows nor owns any such thing and that I have good reason to believe the very reverse  SirYou Frank says the man put on the true look of a desperado resolved on mischief if opposed but that after pausing a moment he began with a kind of humorous anger to rub the side of his face as if it were benumbed Faith on recollection I believe  I got a bit of a cold last night which makes me rather dull of hearing  Sir I repeat  RepateBooThere is no occasion to repate at all at all I remember very well that my friend Captain St Ives owes me three thousand guineas and it being a dibt of honour why to be sure he will pay it without any repating about the matter  Sir said my brother give me leave to tell you  That you will pay me You need not tell me that  Sir  There never yet was man that refused to pay me but oh The almighty thunder I gave him a resate in full for the dibt I made him repint after his death the day that ever he was born  There's the door sir said Frank  Faith and I know there's the door sir but where's the money CaptainThat is I don't mane the ready cash that is not to be expected from a gentlemanA bond in these cases you know Captain is customary  Sir there's the door  I find that your friend here is disposed to be a little upon the Captain Copperthorne this morning and so I shall leave you for the present to consider the matter I have no doubt but I shall hear from you Captain in the course of the four and twenty hours It is now full three weeks since I heard the whiz of a bullet and I would advise you as a friend not to waste any of your powder and ball upon the prisent  occasion It would only be a buz and blow by business Captain for by the holy limb of Luke I never yet saw lead that durst look me in the face  We should be glad to be alone sir  Faith sir you may be as bluff as you please but when the Captain is a little cool I shall expict to receive a bit of a message from him or may I never look on the bald pate of the blessed Peter but he shall receive a bit of a message from me And so once more gintlemen good morning  Frank did not lose a moment after he was gone but hastened home first to inform us of his proceedings thus far and next to make the researches on which he is now absent Here therefore my dear Louisa I must pause and once  again subscribe myself most affectionately  A W ST IVES  P S  I have reason to believe that Clifton is more seriously offended than I ever knew him before When I refused going to the play with him he persisted in saying I might change my mind before night and that he would come again in that hope His manner of parting with me after being told Frank was entrusted with a business which we had not dared confide to him was as I have described unusual and accompanied with more coldness and reserve than either of us had ever before assumed It is now eight o'clock and I have not seen him since If he have resolution enough  to keep away the whole evening which I suspect he will have the proof of the truth of my conjectures will be indubitable  I know not when he comes to hear the business whether he will be convinced that he was less proper to transact it than Frank otherwise I should not be sorry could he but certainly feel himself wrong for it is by a repetition of such lessons that the good we intend must be effected  Be it as it will let us neither recede nor slacken our endeavours I suspect that every worthy task must be a task of difficulty and often of danger  LETTER LXX  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  FRANK is returned and as usual crowned with success  I had been puzzling myself to no purpose concerning Mr Mac Fane being one of our old acquaintance It appears he was the accomplice of the highwayman Webb the brother of Peggy  who was shot by Frank at Turnham Green He forebore to tell me in part because he had not time to connect and relate the grounds of his suspicion though his chief reason was lest a whisper heard by Laura or any other should have betrayed and overturned his whole scheme  He went immediately to question Mrs Clarke concerning her nephew She knew not what was become of him for after having determined to go abroad he changed his mind and being reproved and discountenanced by her he had forborne his visits She had even refused to hear his name mentioned But she believed her niece Peggy had some knowledge of him though she was not certain  Frank thought proper to confide in Mrs Clarke and they immediately went in quest of the niece From her they learned that he had been promoted to the office of groomporter at a gambling house and in fact he proved to be the very man who had been present at the transaction between Edward and Mr Mac Fane  Peggy was next questioned concerning his present hidingplace She was confused she stammered and trembled Was not her brother in danger Could she be sure no harm would come to himAt last however the mild and humane reasoning of Frank and the authority of Mrs Clarke subdued her terrorsHe was in the house  It seems the moment he knew it was  Captain St Ives my brother whom Mr Mac Fane had been plundering he refused to appear or have any further concern in the affair and being violently threatened by the gambler who wanted to force him to come forward as his witness he concealed himself for fear not knowing to what excess so desperate a man might be carried by his passions He and Peggy had just been debating on the propriety of appearing to bear testimony in my brother's behalf but were too much alarmed to decide  Frank lost no time He took the man with him in the carriage and hastened to my brother's apartments where he left him and immediately drove away to Bowstreet to procure the assistance of  the police Previous to this Mr Mac Fane having received some intimation that there was danger had written to my brother The following is a copy of his letter and no bad specimen of the man  Sir  I FIND you think that there is a bit of a blunder in this business and that you doubt the doctors I understand too that Webb the groom porter is under obligations to your honourable family for which raison the lying spalpeen pretends that hesmoaked a bale of FulhamsTo be sure it is all a mistakeI am a man of honour and you Captain are a man of honour also for which I give up the coal to your ginerosity in raison  whereof hush is the word And so in that case I remain your most obadient humble sarvant But if not why the bull dogs must bark  PHELIM MAC FANE  Is it not a pity Louisa that so much courage and ability should be perverted to such vile ends The man by means of the wealth he had so rapidly collected in this manner had secured more than one spy among the Bowstreet runners This we learned from Peggy's brother and it is confirmed by the event for he has forsaken all his former haunts and it is conjectured is either gone off for the continent or which is more probable is lying concealed till he can discover how far he is in danger He was constantly provided with disguises has been  to sea and is intimately acquainted with the manners of the vulgar so that were any strict search made he would not easily be caught But he need not fear his supposed enemy takes no delight in blood and this he will probably soon Iearn and soon again be upon the town  You wonder no doubt how Frank should recognise a man who attempting to rob us on a dark night had stationed himself at the head of the carriage Had he seen no more of him he would have been in little danger of detection But on one of the visits which Frank made to Webb the brother of Peggy he had met him on the stairs Mr Mac Fane as he descended was opposite the window on the landing place and his face was full in the light while Frank could  scarcely be seen by him being then several steps below him His countenance is a remarkable one it has a deep scar above the left eye and Frank suspecting him to be the accomplice of the man he was going to visit had fixed it in his memory  Frank has since been talking very seriously with this brother of Peggy and appears to have convinced him that his present profession is as much that of a thief as his former However in this short space of time without understanding the vile arts of a gambler he has collected between two and three hundred pounds Such is the folly with which money is squandered at these places While Mr Mac Fane is absent he thinks himself in no danger and  should he return he has been promised the protection of our family which he thinks a sufficient guarantee being rather afraid of him as a desperado than as an accuser Webb has therefore agreed to take a shop and exercise his trade as a master He is a man of quick intellects and notwithstanding all that he has done has many good propensities As a proof of these his poor sister the kind Peggy has infinite affection for him and is sure now that he will do well  Sir Arthur and Edward have both been very sincere and hearty in their thanks to Frank to which he answers and answers truly it was a stroke rather of good fortune than of foresight But he has gained himself a character and  they are partly of opinion that every thing must prosper which he undertakes Aunt Wenbourne too overflows in his praise Edward is her favourite and Frank stands now almost as high on her list as he was but a little while ago the reverse for Edward is continually talking of him to her and every word he says is orthodox But opinions like these are too light too full of prejudice too mutable to be of much value  Clifton kept away all the evening however after hearing the whole story he was obliged to acknowledge that let his other qualities be what they would he could not have been so successful as Frank in this affair because he could have known nothing of Mr Mac Fane  But he did not forget that this was an accident unforeseen at the time when Frank was trusted  My constant rule of equanimity of temper has restored him to his wonted goodhumour But I perceive he regrets the possibility of any man equalling him in the esteem of those whose friendship he cultivates Alas Why does he not rather seek to surpass them than to envy their virtues  He says he will propose an eulogium on Frank and give a prize himself to the French Academy for he finds he will never get sufficiently praised in England He never knew so eternal a theme for panegyric In fine it is evident in despite of his efforts to conceal it that his  jealousy increases and I suspect he feels this last decision against him more sensibly than any preceding circumstance  Adieu  Most truly and dearly your own A W ST IVES  LETTER LXXI  COKE CLIFTON TO OUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  WAR Fairfax warIt is declaredOpen warMy wrathful spirits are in a blaze and I am determined Hear and blame me if you can But do I not know you Does not the temper of your letters tell me you will applaud my just anger and fixed revenge  Yes Fairfax longer to palliate or wilfully be blind to the partial edicts and haughty ordonnances of this proud beauty were idiotism She has presumed too far I am not quite so tame a creature as she supposes She shall find I am not the clay but the potter I will mould not be moulded Poltron as I was to think of sinking into the docile domesticated timid animal called husband But the lion's paws are not yet pared beware then my princess  The lady would carry it with a high hand Fairfax But let her If I not note her freaks if I forget her imperious caprice if my embittered mind slumber in its intents say not I am the proudspirited Clifton you once knew that prompt bold and inflexible fellow  whom arrogance could rouse and injury inflame but a suffering patient ass a meek pitiful thing such as they would make me  Wonder not that I now am angry but that I have so long been torpid A little phrensy has restored the palsied soul to life and again has put its powers in motion I'll play no more at questions and commandsOr if I do it shall only be to make sure of my game  I have been reproved silenced tonguetied browbeaten have made myself an ape been placed behind the door and have shewed tricks for her diversion But I am not muzzled yet they shall find me one of the  ferae naturae  A most excellent project forsooth When I am sufficiently familiarized to  contradiction rebuke fillips on the forehead and raps on the knuckles she will then hear me my prayers pack me off peaceably to bed for tonight and graciously bestow a pat and a promise upon me for tomorrow There is danger in the whim lady beauteous though you are and invincible as you may think yourself Model meNoI am of a metal which not even your files can touch You cannot knead doughbake and temper me to your leaven  Fairfax she had fascinated me I own it There is such incantation in the small circle of her eye as mortal man scarcely can resist I adored her nay still adore But she knows me not I have a soul of fire She has driven me beyond the limits of patience  Her wisdom degenerates into rhodomontade She will prescribe the hour and minute when she shall begin to love She does not pretend to love me yet and if she did her looks her manner would betray the falsehood of her heart  Yet let me not wrong her vexed though I am Double dealing is not her error she is sufficiently sincere  Why would I hide it from myself Her partialities all lead another way ay and her passions too if passions she have But this most incomprehensible this tormenting incoherent romance of determining not to have any I believe from my soul in part produces the effect she intends and almost enables her to keep her determination  Still and eternally this fellow This  Frank Oh that I were an Italian and that my conscience would permit me to deal him the stillettoLet him bewareHe is employed preferred praised It is eulogium everlasting Had Fame as many trumpets as she has tongues and lies they would all be insufficient And not only she but the whole family father brother aunts the devil knows who each grateful soul is oozing out the froth of its obligations  Had they less cause perhaps I should be less irritated but he has rescued the poor being of a brother Edward St Ives who had neither courage nor capacity to rescue himself from the gripe of a gambler This Edward who is one of the king's captains God bless him and who has spent his fortune in learning the  trade not of a man of war but of a man of fashion having lost what ready money he had staked his honour against a cogger of dice and was presently tricked out of three thousand guineas which he was too poor in pocket to pay and if I guess right too poor in spirit afterward to face the ruffian whom he had made his companion  So Mr Henley and it please you was chosen by father and daughter Though she owns she proposed it first for she does not scruple to own all which she does not scruple to act The holy mission was his to dole out salutary documents of reproof and apothegms of Epictetus and to try whether he could not release the birdlimed owl I was overlooked I am unfit for the office I  am but little wiser than the booby brother Whereas Solomon himself and the seven sages to boot are but so many men of Gotham when he is present The quintessence of all the knowledge wit wisdom and genius that ever saw the sun from the infantine days of ABC and king Cadmus to these miraculous times of intuition and metaphysical legerdemain is bottled up in his brain from which it foams and whizzes in our ears every time discretion can be induced to draw the cork of silenceOnce again let him beware  I then am selected for no other purpose but for her morality to make experiments uponShe is called wise and wise she may be nay wise she is or at least all other women she being present  are intolerably foolish But by heaven this is no proof of her wisdom I am the scapegoatIBe it soShould she be caught in her own springe who can say I am to blame  She has seen my anger for I could not hide it but she has seen it only in part A hypocrite she wants and a hypocrite she shall have I will act the farce which she is composing let her look to the catastrophe  I begin to think that marriage and I shall never meet for if I withstand her woman cannot tempt me And her I shall withstand At least I never will have her till I have humbled her and then perhaps I shall not be in the humour And yet my heart tells me that I shall For in spite of all its anger in  spite of her injustice and glaring indifference the remembrance of which puts me in a fever it would be misery to know her recollect her and live without her  But patience Her pride shall first be lowered I must command not be commanded and when my clemency is implored I will then take time to consider  My brain is in a ferment and its various engines are already in commotion She herself her hated favourite her father her brother her aunt her uncle her maid every creature that surrounds her must each and all contribute to my purposes and plots Parts fit for the actors must be assigned The how and what I know not yet precisely for I have scarcely sketched the canvas but  I have conceived some bold and masterly strokes and I foresee the execution must be daring and impassioned I am in haste to begin and my hot oscillatory spirits can with difficulty be tamed to the still pause of prudence and premeditation they are eager for the fight and think caution a tardy general if not a coward  I know not how it is but when I am angry very angry I feel as if I were in my element My blood delights to boil and my passions to bubble I hate still water An agitated sea An evening when the fiery sun forebodes a stormy morning and the blackbased clouds rise like mountains with hoary tops to tell me tempests are brewing These give emotion and delight supreme Oh  for a mistress such as I could imagine and such as Anna St Ives moulded by me could make One that could vary her person her pleasures and her passions purposely to give mine variety Whose daily and nightly study all should centre in me and my gratifications Whose eyes should flash lightning to rouse the chilled sensations and shed appeasing dews to quench the fire of rage These are the objects in which I could delight these the devotions I require Change for me A true English day in which winter and summer hail rain and sunshine meet and mingle  I had almost forgotten one chief cause of my resentment though the most fortunate one I could have wished for to  promote my purpose This Sir Arthur dallies with me I find from various items which the candour of her mind has suffered to escape that the motive is poverty I am glad of it I will urge and hurry her into a promise to be mine The generosity of her temper will aid me I will plead the injury done me by hesitation I feel it and therefore my pleadings will be natural It is her pride to repair the wrongs which others commit This pride and this heroism of soul which I must acknowledge in her are unaffected shall be the main engines with which I will work Without these perhaps I might despair but with them hold myself secure of victory  Yes lady of the high sciences you must descend and let my star mount the  horizon The gathering clouds must eclipse your effulgence while I shine chief of the constellation  As for the rest of the family more or less they are all fools therefore are neither to be feared nor pitied On her perhaps I may have compassion when I have taught her contrition and when she knows me for her superior  I have written a volume yet have not half disburthened my labouring mind Oh that I could present the picture to you complete That I could paint her as she is all beauty all excellence all kindness all frost That I could shew the sweet enthusiast in the heyday insolence of her power pretending to guide reform humble and subjugate me while love and vengeance swell my heart  hypocrisy smooths my face and plots innumerable busy my brain It is a fruitful rich resplendent scene of which Fairfax you have no conception Me you have known intimately and are honest enough to own you have admired but of her all ideal tracings are contemptible  Nor should this knight of the magic lanthorn be forgotten this Nestor junior this tormenting rivalOh how I could curse He who stands as ready as if Satan had sent him to feed the spreading flames with oil He fills his place on the canvas And who knows but I may teach him yet to do his office as he ought How would it delight me There is an intemperance of superiority which no human patience can support  nor any acts of kindness compensate A triumph over her will indeed be a triumph over him and therefore doubly delicious  I grant he forbears to prate of the life he gave me But am I not reminded of the oppressive gift every time he dares to contradict me Would I endure his interference as I do would I be shouldered and butted at by him would I permit his opinion to be asked or his dogmas to silence me were I not burthened with this unasked benefit  Infatuated lunatic as I was But I am in the school of prudence at present and suppose I shall learn a little some time though I do not know when since I am told it is not easy to learn a trade one hates  Mean while I pay my court assiduously to the two peers Evelyn and Fitz Allen who at present are both in town Nothing must be neglected nothing left unprepared Vigilance foresight and cunning must do their office and will soon be in full employment of what kind I cannot yet determine or whether it must be open war or covert or both but my augury predicts the scene will soon be all life all agitation all enjoyment Commotion is my element battle my delight and conquest my heaven  This is my hour of appointment she is expecting me yet my crowding thoughts will with difficulty allow me to lay down the pen they rise in armies and I could write world without end  and never come to an amen But I must begone Adieu  I imagine that by this time you are at Paris or will be before the arrival of this letter which according to your directions I shall superscribe  Poste restante  C CLIFTON  LETTER LXXII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  NEED I tell my affectionate friend how great the pleasure is which I receive from her letters and from that free communication of thought which so effectually tends to awaken the best emotions of mind and make us emulate each  other's virtues Like her I sit down now while memory is awake to relate such material incidents as have happened since last I wrote  The anger of Clifton is softened into approbation The most generous minds are liable from the acuteness of their sensibility to be unjust We are once again very good friends  Not but we have just been engaged in a very impassioned scene The subject of family consent was revived by him and as I intended I informed him that delay seemed inevitable  The struggle of his feelings when he heard it appeared to be violent His exclamations were characteristic of his habitual impetuosity the strength of them excited sensations and alarms  which prove the power he has over the passions Oh how I desire to see that power well directed How precious how potent will it then become  One thing and only one he vehemently affirmed could appease the perturbation of his mind and preserve him from wretchedness which none but those who felt like him could conceive  And what I asked was that  He durst not speak itYet speak he must plead he must Should he fail phrensy despair he knew not what but something fearful would indubitably follow  Again what was it  Might he hope It depended on me and denial and distraction were the same  He made me shudder And serious when I heard it though I found his demand to be his manner inspired a confused dread of something repugnant something eminently wrong  He ventured at last to speak I believe he watched his moment The passions Louisa however disturbed are always cunning He demanded a promise solemn and irrevocable to be his  Such a promise I answered was unnecessary and if at all could only be given conditionally  There were no conditions to which he was not ready to subscribe  I replied too much readiness denoted too little reflection and not fortitude sufficient to fulfil such conditions  Fortitude could never fail him having  me not only for an example but a reward Again he repeated without my promise my sacred promise he really and seriously feared distraction That this was weakness he was ready to allow but if it were true and true it was should I want love I yet had too much benevolence not to desire to avert consequences which beyond all others are horrible to imagination  He has surely very considerable knowledge of the human heart for his tone and manner produced all the effect he intended I had foreseen the probability of such a request though not all the urgency with which it was made and had argued the question of right and wrong My conclusion had been that such a promise with certain provisos was a duty  and accordingly I gave it stipulating a power to retract should experience teach us that our minds and principles could not assimilate  At first he was not satisfied Intreaties the most importunate that language could supply were repeated that I should make no such exceptions They were impossibilities needless but tormenting Finding however that I was resolved he softened into acquiescence thanked me with all the transports which might be expected from him and kissed my hand He would not have been so satisfied had I not very seriously repulsed the encroaching freedoms which I had lately found him assuming since which he is become more guarded  What latent inconsistency is there  Louisa in my conduct which can incite the alarms to which I feel myself subject The moment I had made the promise I shuddered and while acting from the strongest sense of duty and the most ardent desire of doing good I felt as if the act were reprehensible and unjustIt is the words of Frank that are the cause on them my mind dwells and painfully repeats them as if in a delirium like a singing in the ear the tolling of deathbells or the burthen of some tragic ditty which memory in its own despite harps upon and mutters to itself  He is certain that I act from mistaken principlesTo the end of time he shall persist in thinking me his by right  There must be something amiss something  feeble in my mind since the decision of reason cannot defend me from the awe which this surely too hasty too positive assertion inspires It haunts my very dreams  Clifton left me and being gone I went into the parlour Frank was there He had a book in his hand and tears in his eyes I never beheld a look more melancholy Capable as he is of resisting the cowardice of selfcomplaint and gloom still there are moments I perceive in which he can yield and sighing over others woes can cast a retrospective glance on self He had been reading the Julia of Rousseau The picture given by St Preux of his feelings had awakened sympathy too strong to be resisted  We fell into conversation I wished to turn his thoughts into a more cheerful channel but my own partook too much of the same medium not to assimilate themselves in part to his languor  You seem pensive Frank What is the subject of your meditations  The sorrows of St Preux madam  Then you are among the rocks of Meillerie Or standing a partaker of the danger of Julia on the dreadful precipice  No madam The divine Julia is deadHad you heard the sigh he gave Louisa I am at a passage which I suspect to be still more sublime I am sure it is equally heartrending  AyWhich is that  It is Clara at the table of Wolmar  where the child with such simplicity conjures up the infantine but almost perfect semblance of the dead If ever laughter inspired the horrors of distraction it was the laugh of Clara  It is a wonderful passage But I find you were rather contemplating the sorrows of the friend than of the lover  Pardon me madam I was considering since the friend was thus on the very brink of despair what must be the force of mind which could preserve the lover  Friendship and love in such minds are the same  Perhaps so madam  Can there be any doubt  When the lover and the friend are  united the heart is reluctant to own its feelings can be equalled  Ought you not to avoid such a book Frank at least for the present  If it led me into error otherwise not I think I know what were the author's mistakes and he not only teaches but impresses rivets volumes of truth in my mind  The recollection of what had just passed with Clifton forced itself upon me Louisa it made me desirous of putting a question to Frank on the subject and I asked  What is your opinion of promises  I think them superfluous nugatory and therefore absurd  Without exception  YesWe cannot promise to do wrong or if we do cannot performNeither can we without guilt refrain from doing right whether we have or have not promised  Some glimpse of this truth for I perceive it to be one had shot across my mind but not with the perspicuity of your propositionI am inclined to be a rude interrogator I have another question to ask He bowedI own you are seldom wrong and yet I hopeI remember Louisa that I gave a deep sigh here and it must not be concealedI hope that you have been wrong once in your life  Madam  But perhaps you have changed your opinion  Do you still think as you didAre you still  certain that I act from mistaken principles  He instantly understood meHad you seen his look Louisa  I am madam  And  shall persist to the end of time  To the end of time  I could not bear it Louisa I burst away  What rash impulse was it that hurried me forward to tempt this trialAlas It was the vain hope for vain it appears to be he might have retracted  My heart is too full to proceedHeaven  bless youHeaven bless you my dear friendYou see how weak I am  A W ST IVES  LETTER LXXIII  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London Grosvenor Street  OLIVER I must flyThere is neither peace nor safety for me if I

uncertainty my body listless my mind incoherent my days wasted in vain reveries on absurd possibilities and my nights haunted by the confused phantoms of a disturbed and sickly brainI must fly  But whitherI know notIf I mean to be truly master of my affections seas must separate us Impossibility must be made more impossible'Tis that Oliver which kills me that ignus fatuus of false hopeWere she even married if her husband were not immortal I feel as if my heart would still dwell and feed on the meagre Maybe It refuses to renounce her and makes a thousand and a thousand efforts to oblige me again to urge its just claims  I am in the labyrinth of contradictions  and know not how to get out My own feelings my remarks on hers the looks actions and discourse of this dangerous lover are all embroiled all incongruous all illusory I seem to tempt her to evil by my stay him I offend and myself I tormentI must therefore begone  Oliver our hearts are unitedTruth and principle have made them one and prejudice and pride have not the power to dissever themShe herself feels this intimately yet persists in her mistake  I think Oliver it is not what the world or what she understands by love which occasions this anarchy of mind I think I could command and reprove my passions into into silence Either I mistake myself or even now situated as I am I could rejoice were there a certainty nay  were there but strong probabilities that her favourite purpose on Clifton should be effected But the more I meditate and my hours days and weeks pass away and are lost in meditation on this subject the more does my mind persist in its doubts and my heart in its claims  Surely Oliver she is under a double mistake Surely her reasonings both on him and me are erroneous  I must be honest Oliver and tell thee all my feelings fears and suspicions They may be false I hope they are but they exist I imagine I perceive in him repeated and violent struggles to appear what he is not nay what I doubt he would despise himself for being  Is not this an unjustifiable a cruel accusation Why have I this keen this jealous  sensibility Is it not dishonourable to my understanding  Yet should there be real danger and I blind to it Should I neglect to warn her or rather to guard and preserve her from harm where shall I find consolation  Oliver There are times when these fears haunt me so powerfully that my heart recoils my blood freezes and my whole frame is shaken with the terrific dreamA dreamYes it must be a dream If not the perversion of his mind and the obduracy of his heart are to me wholly

I must fly to recover myself and not to disturb and waylay others the next I must stay to protect her who perhaps is best able to protect herself  I have no plan I labour to form one in vain That single channel into which my thoughts are incessantly impelled is destructive of all order and connexion The efforts of the understanding are assassinated by the emotions of the heart till the

and I must say offended me so much that I do not yet know what answer to return You say I have thrown you into a quandary Mr Henley and I can very sincerely return  your compliment Mr Henley for nothing can be more unintelligible than your whole letter is to me Mr Henley And I must say I think it not very grateful in you Mr Henley nor in my opinion very proper to write me such a letter Mr Henley that is as far as I understand its meaning Mr Henley I have no desire Mr Henley to quarrel with you if I can help it but I must say I think you have forgotten yourself Mr Henley It is very unlike the manner in which you have been used to comport yourself to me Mr Henley for if I understand you rightly which I own it is very difficult to do you threaten me with foreclosures Mr Henley which I must say Mr Henley is very improper demeanour from you to me Mr Henley  Not that I seek a rupture with you Mr Henley though I must say that all this lies very heavy upon my mind Mr Henley  You insinuate that you are grown rich I think Mr Henley So much the better for you And you seem to know Mr Henley that I am grown poor or I think Mr Henley you would not have written to me in a style which I could almost be tempted to call impertinent but that I wish to avoid a quarrel with you Mr Henley unless you force me to it There is law as you say Mr Henley for every man but law is a very fretful and indeed fearful thing to which you know I am averse Mr Henley Not but there are proceedings Mr Henley which may  lead me to consider how far it is necessary  I must say Mr Henley that my astonishment is very great after writing me word as you did that I might have the money which I took very kindly of you that you should now contradict yourself so flagrantly I am obliged to repeat it Mr Henley and tell me it is not to be had What you mean by the whats and the whys and the wherefores being forthcoming is really above my capacity Mr Henley and I request you would speak plainly that I may give a plain answer  You say you can keep your hat on your head and look your betters in the face Mr Henley May be so But I eave it to your better judgment to consider  Mr Henley whether you ought to forget that they are your betters  There are indeed as you tell me wheels within wheels Mr Henley for I find that you and not my son are in possession of the Edgemoor estate God bless us all and give us clean hands and hearts Mr Henley I say no more Though I must say that when I heard it my hair almost stood an end  You talk a great deal about somebody's son Mr Henley You have puzzled me much but I think you must mean your own son Though what you mean beside is more than I can divine I am very unwilling Mr Henley to think any thing to your disadvantage and I must say that I could wish you would not speak by ifs and ands and  innuendos but let me know at once what you mean and all you mean and then I shall know how to act  Your son I own is a very excellent young gentleman a very extraordinary young gentleman and no person can be more ready to acknowledge his merits than I and my whole family You seem offended with my offer of a commission for him which I own astonishes me for I must say Mr Henley that I thought I was doing you an act of kindness Not that I blame your prudence sir or your aversion to the prodigal spendthrifts who too frequently are fond of red coats and cockades which are so offensive to your notions of prosperity  I am not unwilling to own that I and all my family are even under obligations  to your son For which reason I am the more inclined to overlook what I must say does not please me in your last very unexpected letter Let me tell you Mr Henley that I cannot but hope you will think better of it and that you will use your kind endeavours to get me the money according to your promise which I shall take very friendly of you sir and shall be willing to do any thing for your son in that case for your sake as well as for his own which reason can require  I beg Mr Henley you will consider very seriously of this and I should hope you would not forget former times and the very many favours which in my life I have done you I do assure you sir I have the utmost desire to continue  on a good understanding with you but I think I have some right to expect your compliance from motives of reason not to say of gratitude So committing this to your consideration and expecting an agreeable answer I remain sir as usual  A ST IVES  LETTER LXXV  ABIMELECH HENLEY TO SIR ARTHUR ST IVES  WenbourneHill  MOST ONNURABLE SIR  IT doth appear as how

ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  I HAVE had a scene with Frank which affected me much and which has occasioned another quarrel or kind of a quarrel with Clifton Sir Arthur had just left the room He had been asking Frank whether there were any possible way by which he could serve him We  all were his debtors very deeply and he should be happy to find any mode of discharging the obligation Sir Arthur spoke with an earnestness which in him is by no means customary But Frank had nothing to ask nothing to propose  I was sitting at my harpsichord amusing myself and Sir Arthur being gone stopped to tell Frank how sincerely I joined in Sir Arthur's feelings  I have nothing madam said he to hope from Sir Arthur but to you I have a request to make which you would greatly oblige me should you grant  I trembled Louisa I was afraid of some new contest of the passions a revival of ideas which I myself had so lately and so inadvertently called to mind I am persuaded the blood forsook  my cheeks when I asked him what it was for Frank with a tenderness in his voice that was indeed honourable to his heart prayed conjured me not to be alarmedIt was a trifleHe would be filentHe would not give me a moment's pain to gratify a million of such silly wishes  He both moved and revived me It could not be any thing very dreadful and I entreated him to speak There was nothing he could ask I would refuse  He hesitated and I then became urgent At last he namedHis songAgain Louisa he almost struck me to the heartHe feared he offended me but there was something so enchanting in the air that he could not forget it  could not resist the wish to possess a copy  It was impossible to refuse I went to my papers and brought it The evil spirit of thoughtlessness possessed me and when I delivered it I askedIs there any thing else  Your kindness madam said he is unalterable Could IDurst I  What  He paused  Speak  He laid the song upon the musicdesk and lookedNo noI will not attempt to tell you how  Words were needless they could not petition with such eloquenceA barbarian could not have refused I rambled over the keys hemmed and  endeavoured to collect myself At last a sense of propriety of reason of principle came to my aid and bade me be master of my mind I began to sing but no effort could enable me to give that expression of which I had before found the words so susceptible  Could you think it Louisa Do you now foresee do you forebode what happenedYour brother came in  To have stopped to have used evasion to have had recourse to falsehood would have turned an act of virtue into contemptible vice I continued Clifton came and looked over my shoulder The music was on one sheet of paper the words were on another in the writing of Frank Your brother knew the hand  When I had ended Frank took both  the papers thanked me and retired I could perceive the eyes of Clifton sparkle with emotion I might almost say rage He would have spoken but could not and I knew not how safely to begin  At length a consciousness of not having done or at least intended to do wrong gave me courage I determined not to wait to be questioned I asked him how he liked the song  Oh ExceedinglyIt was very fineVery fine  The words are Mr Henley's  I imagined as much madam  I thought them expressive and amused myself with putting a tune to them  I am as good as a witch  How did you like the subject  What subject madam  Of the words  I really don't knowI have forgotten  Nay you said you thought them very fine  Oh YesTrueVery fineAll about loveI recollect  Well and having so much faith in love you do not think them the worse for that  Oh by no meansBut I thought you had  Love in a song may be pardonable  Especially madam if the song be written by Mr Henley  CliftonYou almost teach me to despairYou do not know mePerhaps however I am more to blame than you at present Timidity has  given me some appearance of conscious guilt which my heart disavows But as there is scarcely any error more dangerous to felicity than suspicion I own I am sorry to see you so frequently its slave Never think of that woman for a wife in whom you cannot confide And ask yourself whether I ought to marry a man who cannot discover that I merit his confidence  I find indeed implicit faith to be as necessary in love as in religionBut you know your power madam  An indifferent spectator would rather say you know yours  You will not go madam and leave me thus  I must  In this misery  I have letters to write and visits to pay  You cannot be so cruelBy heaven madam this torment is more than nature can support  Less impetuosity Clifton less raptures and more reason  You would have me rock madam Unfeeling marble  I would have you a man a rational and if possible a wise one  Stay at least for a momentHear meDo not leave me in these doubts  What doubtsDo I not tell you the words are Mr Henley's The air is mine If setting them were any guilt it is a guilt of which I am not conscious Shew me that it is criminal and I will instantly retract We must either overcome  these narrow these selfish propensities or we shall hope in vain to be happy  III make no accusation  Do but examine before you accuse and I will patiently hear and cheerfully answer to accusation If you think it wrong in me not to treat virtue and genius with neglect bring me your proofs and if I cannot demonstrate their fallacy I will own my error Let me add the accusation of reason is a duty from which though painful we ought not to shrink It is the mistaken accusation of the passions only at which justice bids the heart revolt  Here Louisa once again I left him with struggles apparently more acute than the former And my own mind is  so affected so oppressed as it were by crowds of ideas that I do not yet know whether this were an accident to be wished or even whether I have entirely acted as I ought My mind will grow calmer and I will then begin the scrutiny  I am minute in relating these particulars because I am very desirous of doing right And who is so capable of being my judge or who so anxious I should not err as my dear Louisa my friend my sister  All good be with you  A W ST IVES  LETTER LXXVII  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Doverstreet  OH Fairfax if my choler rose when last I wrote where shall I now find words hot enough to paint the

the illuminated the angelic and the irrefragable to him were tyros all Our censor in private and in public our familiar like a malignant demon no respect no place no human barriers could exclude him On no side could the offended eye turn and not find him there Disgraced by his company counteracted  by his arrogance insulted by his sarcasms obliged to accept the first of favours life at his hands

wrested a promise from her to be mine These romancers Fairfax hold love promises to be binding and sacred And this obtained I thought a fair foundation for my fabric  The current of my thoughts is now wholly turned to this subject A thousand manoeuvres crowding present themselves nor can I say how many must be employed I have generally found my brain rich in expedients and I think it will not fail

occasionally to her mistress and to praise the favorite who has never lately been any great favorite with her having as I guess overlooked her when she had kinder inclinations She was tickled with the contrivance which promised to secure her so well from the suspicion of her mistress  and she acts her part tolerably In fact her mistress seems a being without suspicion superior to it and holding it

easy it is to undertake how difficult to overcome With what facility did I say to myselfThus will I do and thusHow firmly did I promise Truth appeared so beautiful so captivating  so omnipotent that armed by her an infant could not but conquer Perseverance alone was requisite and I could persevere The solid basis of the earth should almost shake ere I would waverPoor vain creatureSurely Louisa we are not all soHeaven forbid  Why am I thus Why does my heart faint within me Indeed Louisa I begin to fear I have vaunted of powers I do not possess and prescribed to myself duties too dignified too mighty for meAnd must I abandon an enterprise I deemed so nobleI have meditated on it Louisa till I could weep  I will not yet despair At least one effort more and a strong one I will makeAlas I am weary of this promising  My braggart strength is impotency or little better But I will do my best and truth sincerity and good intent must be my trust  My present determination is to relate to your brother all that has passed between me and Frank I will once more state my feelings my principles and my plan The purity of my heart must be my shield To contend thus is painful yet most willingly would I contend were it productive of the good at which I aim But instead of gaining ground I seem to lose Oh that I were more wise that I better knew the human heart and that I well could wield the too gigantic weapons of truth But I fear they are above my force and pity my own imbecility  The hour of appointment is come Clifton will soon be here I have been preparing my mind taxing my memory and arranging my thoughts Oh that this effort may be more successful than the past Did he but know all the good I wish him his heart would surely not feel angerHe shall not die said FrankCan I forget itHow did my soul glow within me when hopeless but the moment before I beheld nature again struggling for existence and returning life once more stir in the convulsive lip How did my ears tingle with"He shall not die"I saw a noble quality exerted and thought it was but to wish and to have to imitate and to succeedThe brother of my LouisaA mind too that might outsoar  the eagle and gaze on the sun of truth  There must be some cause for my failure if I failWith true simplicity of heart I can say most earnestly do I wish to do right most ardently would I endeavour to prove myself a friend worthy of Louisa Clifton and of Frank HenleyPerhaps the latter is the causeIf I have done him wrong Heaven forgive me For I think were I convicted of it I could not forgive myself  The servant has told me Clifton is below I must take a few minutes to breatheI must collect myself Oh for the tongues of mediating angels  A W ST IVES  LETTER LXXIX  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  WHEN last my Louisa heard from me my mind was depressed I almost despaired of the great task I had undertaken I had likewise an immediate duty a disburthening of my soul a kind of confession of facts to make from which education has falsely accustomed us to  shrink with pain and my spirits were overclouded This rigorous duty is performed hope again begins to brighten and my eased heart now feels more light and cheerful  Not but it still is tremulous with the sensations by which it has just been thrilled I seem to have risen from one of the most interesting and I believe I may add awful scenes in which I have ever been engaged The recesses of the soul have been searched that no retrospective accusation of want of absolute and perfect candour might as of late it too often has done rise to assault me  I found Clifton in the parlour His look was more composed more complacent and remarkably more thoughtful  than it had lately been I began with stating that the feelings of my heart required every act every thought of mine that had any relation whatever to him should be fully and explicitly known I conjured him to have the goodness to determine not to interrupt me that I might perform this office clear my conscience and shew my heart unveiled undisguised exactly as it was and that he might at once reject it if it were either unworthy his acceptance or incompatible with his principles  He promised compliance and kept his word I never knew him a listener so long or with such mute patience I had as I may say studied the discourse which I made to him and which I thus began  It will not be my intention Mr Clifton in what I am going to say to appear better or worse than I am Should I be partial to myself I wish you to detect me There is nothing I so much desire as a knowledge of my own failings This knowledge were it truly attained would make the worst of us angels Our prejudices our passions and our ignorance alone deceive us and persuade us that wrong is right  I have before acquainted you of the project of Mrs Clifton and Sir Arthur for our union I have told you of the unfeigned friendship the high admiration and the unbounded love I have for your sister or in other words for her virtues A short acquaintance shewed me that your mind had all the capacity  to which the most ardent of my hopes aspired It had indeed propensities passions and habits which I thought errors but not incurable The meanest of us have our duties to fulfil which are in proportion to our opportunities and our power I imagined that a duty of a high but possible nature presented itself and called upon me for performance  You no doubt will smile at my vanity but I must be sincere By instruction by conversation and by other accidents it appeared to me that I had been taught some high and beneficial truths and principles which you by contrary instruction conversation and accidents had not attained Convinced that truth is irresistible I trusted in the power of these truths rather than of myself  and said here is a mind to which I am under every moral obligation to impart them because I perceive it equal to their reception The project therefore of our friends was combined with these circumstances which induced me willingly to join their plan and to call my friend sister was an additional and delightful motive It appeared like strengthening those bonds between us which I believe no human force can break  An obstacle or rather the appearance of an obstacle somewhat unexpectedly arose From my childhood I had been in part a witness of the rising virtues of young Mr Henley Difference of sex of situation and of pursuits prevented us till lately from being intimate I had  been accustomed to hear him praised but knew not all the eminence with which it was deserved He was my supposed inferior and it is not very long since I myself entertained some part of that prejudice I know myself now not to be his equal  A recollection of combining circumstances convinced me that he had for some time and before I suspected it thought on me with partiality He believes there is great affinity in our minds he avows it and with a manly courage becoming his character which abhors dissimulation has since confessed an affection for me nay has affirmed that unless I have conceived some repugnance to him which I have not nor ever can  conceive I ought as a strict act of justice to myself and him to prefer him before any other  I should acknowledge the cogency of the reasons he assigns and certainly entertain such a preference did it not appear to me that there are opposing and irreconcileable claims and duties It is my principle and perhaps still more strongly his that neither of us must live for ourselves but for society In the abstract our principle is the same but in the application we appear to differ He thinks that the marriage of two such people can benefit society at large I am persuaded that the little influence which it would have in the world would be injurious and in some sort fatal to the small circle for which I seem to exist and  over which my feeble influence can extend  For these reasons only and in compliance with what I believe to be the rigorous but inflexible injunctions of justice have I rejected a man whom I certainly do not merit a man whose benevolent heart capacious mind and extraordinary virtues are above my praise and I almost fear beyond my attainment  My memory will not furnish me with every word and incident that have passed between us and if it would such repetition would be tedious But I wish you clearly to understand that Mr Henley has made these declarations to me that my mode of acting and my reasons have been such as I have mentioned that I am not myself so perfectly satisfied  with these reasons but that I sometimes am subject to recurring doubts and that I do at present and while I have thought or sense shall continue to admire his genius and his virtue  If what he has said or what I have done be offensive to you if you cannot think highly of him and innocently of me if my thoughts concerning him can possibly be stained with a criminal tinge in your eyes it becomes you and I now most solemnly call upon you as a man disdaining deceit at once to say so and here to break off all further intercourse Esteem nay revere him I do and ever must and instead of being guilty for this my principles tell me the crime would be to esteem and revere him less  I trust in the frankness of my heart for  the proof of it's sincerity My determination is to have a clear and unspotted conscience Purity of mind is a blessing beyond all price and it is that purity only which is genuine or of any value The circumstance I am going to relate may to you appear strange and highly reprehensibleBe it soIt must be told  We never had but one conversation in which the subject of marriage as it related to him and me was directly and fairly debated He then behaved as he has done always with that sincerity consistency and fortitude by which he is so peculiarly characterised A conversation so interesting in which a man of such uncommon merit was to be rejected by a woman who cannot deny him to be  her superior could not but awaken all the affections of the heart I own that mine ached in the discharge of its duties and nothing but the most rooted determination to abide by those duties could have steeled it to refusalIt was a cruel fortitude  But while it ached it overflowed and to you more especially than to any other person upon earth I think it necessary to say that at a moment when the feeling of compassion and the dread of being unjust were excited most powerfully in my bosom paradoxical as it may seem my zeal to demonstrate the integrity and innocence of my mind induced me tokiss him  I scarcely can proceedThere are sensations almost too strong to be subdued  The mind with difficulty can endure that mistake that contortion which can wrest guilt out of the most sublime of its emanationsHowever if it were a crime of that crime I am guiltyI pretend not to appear other than I am and what I am it is necessary at this moment that you should know  This conversation and this incident happened on the day on which you met him in the corridor coming from my chamber A day Mr Clifton worthy of your remembrance and of your emulation for it afforded some of the strongest proofs of inflexible courage of which man is at present capable He had been robbed of the hope dearest to his heart had been rejected by the woman he had chosen to be the friend and  companion of his life had been enjoined the task of doing all possible good to his rival which he had unconditionally promised and he left her toreceive a blow from this rival's hand  Far be it from me Mr Clifton to wish to give you pain or insult your feelingsOh noI retrace the picture only because I think it one of the most instructive lessons for private life the stores of memory can supply  I must further inform you that but a few days ago I questioned him whether he had not changed his opinion concerning me hoping that after mature reflection he might have thought as I do that to refuse him was a duty But he persists in believing it to be an  error He does not however obtrude his thoughts upon me on the subject of love an anchorite could not be more silent or a brother more delicate That one conversation excepted he has made no further attempts A few words were indirectly said when as I have just told you I questioned him but they were excited by me  With respect to the song at which you have last taken offence its brief history is that it was written or at least first seen by me soon after our arrival in France I found it on my musicdesk and I dare affirm it had been left there by mistake not design I supposed it to be his from the handwriting and I set it because it affected me  The day on which you found me singing it to him was the first on which it was ever mentioned by him to me and then after he had been pressed by Sir Arthur to know how he could serve him a copy of it was begged from me as the only favour the family could bestowHe has done us many favours Favours which we shall never have an opportunity to repay Though my hands are impotent ere my thoughts can be restrained from being just to his worth I must be convinced there is guilt in those thoughts  How to address myself now personally to you Mr Clifton I scarcely know The world perhaps would call my views extravagant my pretensions impertinent and my plan absurdThe world  must do its willIn the progress toward truth I have presumed to think you several steps behind me I have proposed to myself in some sort to be your instructress I have repeated my plan to the person whom you perhaps may consider as your rival I have required his aid and have avowed that I think him very considerably your superior Each and all of these may be and I suppose are offensive but the proceedings of rectitude never can be dark hidden and insidious When I have said all that I think of you I should hope you will be more inclined to believe me equitable  There are many leading principles in which we differ and concerning which till we agree to proceed to marriage  would be culpable These you were at first eager to examine but finding the side you took not so clear and wellestablished as you had imagined displeased by contradiction and in the spirit of that gallantry which you profess to admire being willing to appear complaisant to the female to whom you pay your addresses you have lately declined discussion You think no doubt that the lover ought to yield and the husband to command both of which I deny Husband wife or lover should all be under the command of reason other commands are tyranny Reason and not relationship alone can give authority  You think that the claims of birth to superiority are legitimate I hold them  to be usurpations I deem society and you self to be the first of claimants Duels with you are duties with me crimes Suicide you allow to be generally an act of insanity but sometimes of virtue I affirm that no one who is not utterly useless in society or who cannot by dying be of greater use than by living can have a right over his own life and of the existence of such a being I doubt You maintain that what you possess is your own I affirm it is the property of him who wants it most  These are essential differences Nor are these all but perhaps they are more than sufficient to end the alliance we were seeking  Not that I desire to end itFar far the reverseYou Mr Clifton are so  highly gifted so distinguished in the rank of intellect and have a mind of such potency that to behold its powers employed in the cause of truth to be myself instrumental in a work so worthy and afterward to become the fast and dearest friend of such a mind is a progression so delightful so seducing that for a time I laboured to persuade myself of its possibility  These hopes begin to fade and did you know how much this circumstance afflicts me you would at least absolve me from all charge of indifference  Habits and prejudices which are sanctioned by the general practice and even by numbers who are in many respects eminently wise and virtuous are too stubborn to be overcome by the impotent  arguments of a young female with whom men are much more prone to trifle toy and divert themselves than to enquire into practical and abstract truth In the storm of the passions a voice so weak would not be heard  That all these impediments should be removed I begin to believe but little probable and till they are removed as we are we must remain  The obstacles to marriage are indeed so numerous that I perceive calculation to be very much in favour of celibacy I mean respecting myself I ask not riches but of wealth of mind my expectations by some would be called extravagant Yet lower these expectations I cannot for that would be to relax in principle  I ended and your brother still sat patient and willing to listen had I desired to continue After a short pause he repliedThe profound attention I have paid madam will I hope convince you I have not been an idle listener Your words or at least the substance of them have sunk deep in my heart Your desire that I should remember them scarcely can equal mine To me madam they are so important that the moment I return home confident as I usually am of my memory I will not trust it now but commit them to writing  What your motives are for this unusual care or whether you do or do not feel yourself offended Mr Clifton it is not possible for me to divine but as I  think it alike unjust to conceal what I have done or what I have said however mistaken my words or actions may have been I will spare you the trouble of writing if you think proper and send you a tolerably correct transcript of my thoughts tomorrow morning I can easily repeat them assisted by some memorandums that I have already made and by the strength of my recollection and my feelings which I think are in no danger of a sudden decay  You will infinitely oblige me madam and I will endeavour to profit by the favour My mind is at present as much awake to the subject as yoursI hope you are not unwilling to converse with me on the topics on which we may happen to differ  UnwillingOh noIt was your unwillingness that led me almost to despairBut are you in earnestTruly and sincerely in earnest  In earnest madam truly and sincerely in earnest  And will you really reflect seriously deeply on the subject in question  As deeply madam as you yourself could wish  Mr Clifton your present tone and manner rejoice meYou half revive my hopesBut let me conjure you to be sincere with your own heart Examine every thing I have said every thing especially what relates to Frank Henley All that I have observed of your temper from first to last obliges me thus seriously to warn you  Fear not madam I will obey your injunctions I will examine with all the severity you could wishThe cup may have its bitters but its contents must be swallowedYou will not judge ill of me madam for my frankness  Oh no Be frank be true be worthy of yourself  Such as you would have me madam I must becomeAll I request is that you would aid me in the task  And are you indeed as determined as you seem to be  I am madam I never before Louisa saw your brother look or speak with such firmness You have been kindly pleased to say you once prescribed it as a duty to yourself to teach or attempt to teach me your principles  Not mine but the principles of truth Cool and fair enquiry is all I wish Should any of your principles be better founded than mine I shall be most happy to become your scholar I am aware how impossible it is that any two people should think exactly alike on any one subject much less on all but on certain great leading points were you and I to continue as opposite as we are and were we to marry felicity could not be the consequence  Let us hope madam it is possible we should make a marriage of opinions which you think as necessary as of persons  QuiteQuiteLet me conjure you however not to deceive yourself Pretend to no conviction you do not  feel nor degrade the honest sincerity of your heart by any unworthy indulgence of desire  Here Louisa our conversation ended Company came in and the customary occupations of the day took place But it is with heartfelt pleasure I add that your brother behaved as if he had forgotten his former character and was at last firmly resolved to assume a new one I have often endeavoured to encourage hope but never before felt it in anything like the same degree He cannot but be in earnest his determination for the first time to commit all I had said to writing is an indubitable proofMay the same propensities continue and increase  "He shall not die" will again be the burthen of my songWhat a noble mind might his becomeMightLet us once more be bold and say willOh that to do were as easy as to say  A W ST IVES  END OF VOLUME IV
