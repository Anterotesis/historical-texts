 AN APPENDIX To the Second Edition of Mr Lofft's 'OBSERVATIONS  On a late Publication entitled  A Dialogue on the actual State of Parliaments  and on some other Tracts equally inimical to the Constitution of  'Free Parliaments'  BEING A FARTHER EXAMINATION Of the Argument lately published by Mr HATSELL in his  Precedents of Proceedings c  against  the antient Law and Constitution of this Kingdom that the King ought to hold Parliaments elected annually  By GRANVILLE SHARP  Great is the TRUTH and stronger than all Things it liveth and conquereth for evermore  APPENDIX  THE supposed  opinion  of Mr Hatsell in his  Precedents of Pro∣ceedings in the House of Commons  under the title of  King calls the Parliament  as compendiously stated by my worthy and very learn∣ed friend Mr Lofft in p of his Observations is a much more fa∣vourable construction than Mr Hatsell's  own words  can really warrant though all persons who are acquainted with that gentleman's very a∣miable character including the writer of this remark have reason to wish for his sake that his  opinion  whatever it may be had been so expressed as to be really limited by the moderate and very friendly con∣struction which Mr Lofft has put upon it Mr Lofft supposes the  opi∣nion  of Mr Hatsell to be that  the intent of the statutes of Edward and the ancient law and constitution of the kingdom require parliaments to  SIT  once at least in every year but  NOT  that they should be  ANNUALLY OR OFTENER ELECTED  but Mr Hatsell himself if we may judge by his manner of writing is far from admitting that  the constitution requires parliaments  even  to  SIT once a year or that  the king is obli∣ged to call a parliament once at least in every year  for this he has contemptuously treated merely as  'a notion'  that  has been some∣times entertained  p n and he asserts that  those persons who maintain  THIS DOCTRINE  i e the doctrine last cited in his own words as a  general  doctrine having two different accep∣tations arising from the th and th Edward III  'do not mean'  says he  that according to these statutes  A SESSION  of parliament shall be hol∣den every year but that  A NEW ELECTION shall be had c  In an∣swer to which it may be sufficient to oppose one eminent example for all viz that the learned commentator Judge Blackstone notorious∣ly denied as well as himself that the  latter  doctrine  'ever was'  the  mean∣ing  of those ancient statutes though he actually was one of  those per∣sons who maintained  the  former  general construction of the said sta∣tutes the only operative construction they are  now  capable of bearing since the traverse of the modern acts for  triennial  and  septennial  elections as being still in force to  bind the king  See Com c p where the learned writer having mentioned that  the king only can con∣voke a parliament  immediately adds  and  THIS  by the ancient sta∣tutes of the realm  HE IS BOUND TO DO EVERY YEAR  or oftener if need be  for which in a note he expressly cites these statutes of K Ed III and immediately afterwards he mentions the two different acceptations of  the said statutes  'Not'  says he  'that he'  i e the king  is or  ver was obliged by these statutes to call a  NEW  parliament every year but on¦ly to permit a parliament to  SIT  annually  c The words  'to permit'  being a verb in the infinitive mood do manifestly require a repetitio  to be understood of the preceding verb  'is obliged'  viz  is oblige  to permit  which confirms by  necessary grammatical construction  th  doctrine of the preceding sentence that the king  'is bound'  by the sai  ancient statutes This doctrine is strongly confirmed by the nationa  declaration in the preamble to the statute of Charles I c  that by the laws and statutes of this realm the  parliament ought to be hol¦den  AT LEAST ONCE EVERY YEAR  for the redress of grievances  c  which though the act is repealed is stated as being still an existing principle of parliamentary doctrine by Judge Hales in his  Original Institution Power c of Parliaments  p and which is still farther confirmed by the constant  'usage and custom of parliament  ever since the revolution as well as by the obvious  reason  and  necessi¦ty  of it whereby the  'lex et consuetudo parliamenti'  upon this poin  must surely be sufficiently clear not to be mistaken by persons o  much less intelligence in those matters than  the clerk of the house of commons  Yet Mr Hatsell does not admit even this general construction of the ancient statutes and as a proof that he  does not  I need only to observe that though he is writing expressly concerning what he call  the undoubted prerogative of the crown to judge of the expediency of calling  parliament and to determine at what time the writs shall issue yet this pre∣rogative  says he  is limited by two acts of parliament the  th  Ch  II  c    and the  th  of Wm Mary c    both of which  c  enact that from henceforth a parliament shall be holden once in three years at the least  so that in obedience  TO THESE LAWS  says he without citing any other  limitation  either of  statute  or  usage  but  these  two acts for  triennial  parliaments  the ministers of the crown  says he  are bound to take care  that  THE SITTING  and holding of parliaments shall not be  INTERMITTED  or  DISCONTINUED  above three years at the most  And it is their duty  says he  to give directions for issuing the writs of summons  ACCORDINGLY  ie according to the two acts for  triennia  parliaments or rather to a part of one of them viz the part he has selected for the direction of  'the ministers of the crown'  to  take care that the  SITTING c  shall not be  INTERMITTED or DISCONTINUED  above three years at the most  whereby he leaves  the ministers of the crown  at liberty to  intermit and discontinue for three years  even the SITTING of parliament for he has cited no other  limitation  of the pre∣rogative on this head and with respect to the two ancient statutes of K Edward III he did not it seems think them worthy even to be named in his  text  but only in a  note  to shew that he had not forgot them where he has treated even their  general  construction merely as "  a notion  c" See p  But though the original meaning and force of these ancient statutes are materially affected and injured by the modern acts for  triennial  and  septennial  parliaments yet they are certainly still in force as Judge  Blackstone has allowed to  oblige  the king  'to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business'  and this without impediment from the words  'if need be'  in the  'loose and vague'  manner that the Judge has applied them contrary to the necessary  gram∣matical  construction of the whole sentence see 'Declaration of the 'People's Rights p to nFor our right to an  annual ses∣sion of parliament  is founded on the ancient constitution of the kingdom on laws that are almost coeval with our national existence in this island See the  'usage perpetual'  ordained by K Alfred and cited by Lord Coke Inst p viz  'Le Roy Alfred'  fist  assem∣bler les Counties c et ordeina pur  USAGE PERPETUEL  que deux foitz par an ou pluis sovent pour mister  mestier  in temps de peace se assemblerent a Londres a parliamenter sur le guidament del people de Dieu c  The testimony of Knighton  one of our best his∣torians  as Mr Petyt calls him in his preface to the Ancient Right of the Commons p  that by an ancient  STATUTE  and  CUSTOM  laudable and approved which nobody could deny the king was  ONCE IN A YEAR  to convene his  LORDS  and  COMMONS  to his Court of Parlia∣ment  c Mr Nevill's testimony concerning an ancient statute of Edward I ordering that  a parliament shall be held every year and oftener if need be  for which see his Plato Redivivus p The same doctrine declared in the very next reign as proved by Mr Petyt p from Rot Claus Edw II m intus that  "upon a petition to the king"  K Edw II '  he granted that  "SEMEL IN ANNO TENEATUR  parliamentum"  c whence it is evident that the act of Edw III c was not a  new  law but a declaration of the  old  constitution viz  That a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be  which was again confirmed by statute in the Ed III c And the USAGE of those times proved by the  writs issued for general elections  frequently  MORE OFTEN  than 'ONCE' in a year excludes all  'doubtful'  ness from these ancient statutes so that  new  parliaments must necessarily have been understood until by the traverse of modern acts they became applicable only to the  annual sitting  of parliament  The opposers of the original meaning viz for  annual elections  and  more often  have rendered that construction still more obvious by their own miserable shifts to evade it One says the words are  loose and vague  though such a charge is applicable only to his own  un∣grammatical  construction and another would render the acts  doubt∣ful  by boldly excluding the only just criterion for  clearing up doubts  in such a case viz the USAGE  of the times in which the acts were made  and instead of it would have us refer ONLY to  the practice  and to  'the opinion'  of persons who lived from to years after those times But the proposer seems not to be aware that this mode of  'explaining ancient statutes'  is exactly similar to one of the most gross and delusive practices of  popery  The apostate church of Rome for obvious reasons cannot submit the determination of what ought to be esteemed  apostolic doctrine  to the evidence of  apostolic  times  and of course she is driven to this wretched subterfuge of re∣ferring for evidence in favour of her  innovations  and unscriptural prac∣tices to the traditions of  more modern times  and to the  practices  and  opinions  of persons who lived from to years afterwards in or∣der to invalidate  all cotemporary evidence  of  facts  and  primitive usages  And surely this dishonest and arbitrary mode of  'settling doubts'  is e∣qually unjustifiable in  legal  and  political  as in  religious  questions Yet Mr Hatsell boldly ventures to tell us that  where the expressions of acts of parliament  speaking of the acts of Edward  passed above  FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO  are  DOUBTFUL  says he though the contrary is evident  nothing can clear up and settle these  DOUBTS  but the  OPINION  of all the wisest and bestinformed persons  c  from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the present time  P n Thus even the commencement of the time here proposed as  the best  for afford∣ing information is actually more than two hundred years AFTER  the times  in which the acts were made and he cuts off all  cotemporary  as well as  intermediate evidence  by a single bold assertion that  nothing can clear up but  c taking care to secure to himself the ample space of ano∣ther two hundred years still more distant from  the times  in question that he may range more securely in his search for  precedents  of innova∣tions both in  practice  and  opinion  And indeed he has most industriously displayed the  practices  of the Stuarts reminding us in the course of argument even of  'intermissions of parliaments'  for several years toge∣ther  'an intermission of Parliament of six years'  by K James I  'an intermission of parliaments for twelve years' together  by K Charles I These were surely most unpropitious times for  parliamentary knowledge  and Mr Hatsell does not seem to be aware that the fear of similar  intermissions  was probably the principal cause which withheld the patriots of those days from urging their  electionrights  at a time when the sum total of all their  rights  was at stake even  the right to have any parliament at all  so that their  silence  respecting  annua  elections  does not at all assist Mr Hatsell's argument against them The people of England in those times were rendered so deplorably  abject  by the  unlimited  and therefore  illegal  rule of  Tudors  and  Stuarts  that it was considered as a crime in the preceding reign of James I even to urge the expediency of calling a parliament at all  I would fain know the man that durst persuade the king unto it  says THE MI¦NISTER OF STATE in Sir Walter Rawleigh's Dialogue on the  Prero¦gative of Parliaments  p so that this was undoubtedly the language of  those times  to which Mr Hatsell has referred us for  acts opinions  and  speeches  whereby with the addition of some still more modern in formation he thinks  the true intent and meaning of the words used in th  statutes of Edward  III  though made almost years before  migh  be best explained  but to look for explanatory  'opinions'  and  'speeche  ▪  in such arbitrary times when men dared not to  speak  their  opinions  upo  the subject is too great an absurdity so that Mr Hatsell is peculiarl  unfortunate in fixing his aera for  parliamentary information  And ye  if  'the wisest and bestinformed men'  of those times had shewn a littl  more regard to the nation's  rights  than to the  security  of their own per∣sons and property for  rich  men are commonly the  worst citizens  for various reasons and had ventured like  honest men  rather than like  wise and prudent  'The prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time'  Amos v  men  to speak their opinions in favour of that SACRED TRUTH our indispensible right to the actual  sitting  of a  new  parliament  'every year once'  at least  'and more often if need be'  a truth never to be concealed a claim never to be relaxed they might probably with God's blessing in the cause of  truth  and  right  have so checked the progress of unconstitutional doctrines as to deter their kings and states∣men from changing a  limited  monarchy to an  absolute  tyranny and might thereby have prevented the horrible effects of  misrule  which speedily broke out and overwhelmed the state and indeed the infringe∣ment of our  parliamentary rights  was the true source of all the mischiefs that shortly followed for when the able patriots named by Mr Hatsell were struggling almost in despair to retain the mere existence of a parliament under K Charles I they did not seem to apprehend that their full constitutional claim to an  annual election  was a subject proper to be discussed at such a time but their only aim when they met  'after an intermission of parliaments for twelve years'  seems to be how they might  prolong their  SITTING  at any rate  for the redress of grie∣vances whereby it is manifest that the obstinate monarch's unwil∣lingness to  permit a parliament to  SIT together with the previous crimi∣nal  intermissions  as one  illegality  is apt to beget another became eventually the parents of a still greater evil  a long parliament without any election at all  which severely repaid  the royal perfidy  in kind by  'an  intermission'  in return  of regal government  an exclusion of that per∣  ured monarch's family from the throne for exactly the same number of years that he had presumed to  intermit  the sitting of parliaments vizfor 'TWELVE YEARS  at one time  ' and even the SIX YEARS  intermission  n his father's reign was severely repaid in a bloody SIX YEARS war until the son's imprisonment and death  These are awful examples worthy the serious attention of all parties  hough we are bound at the same time to discriminate between  exam∣ples  or  facts  and  precedents  that such  baneful examples  may not by the critical  observations  of ingenious men be drawn into  precedents  for  pro∣ceedings  but that the  legal  acceptation of the word  precedent  may always  e duly maintained  Mr Hatsell's argument upon the whole is certainly a very extraor∣  inary one not only because the  arbitrary times  to which he has limited the commencement of our parliamentary researches seem to be utterly incapable of affording the least information upon the par∣ticular point in question and are also near  three hundred years  AFTER  the only proper time  for ascertaining the  usage of the times  when the statutes to be explained were made but also because he perempto∣rily  excludes all other evidence whatever  Nothing can clear up c but the opinion c from the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth c  I am far more willing to attribute such an unaccountable argument to  inattention  and a  superficial manner of writing  than to suspect any  rea  design  of the ingenious author to promote a mode of  explaining ancient statutes  so dangerously presumptuous and arbitrary And to justify the more moderate conclusion of the two he has luckily furnished me with an easy and obvious proof of it in the very next chapter but one to which he has given the running title of  King adjourns the Parlia∣ment    'King adjourns the Parliament'  for several pages together i e from to so that that one would naturally suppose that  he really meant what he had so often written  but at length though not till the very last page of that head he kindly guards us against that baneful error by an explicit stating of what HE HIMSELF believes to be  the true parliamentary doctrine  viz  That the king has no authority to adjourn the parliament  and of course his  'superficial manner'  of expressing himself I mean on this particular head must be corrected in his next edition to  'the true parliamentary doctrine'    King does  NOT  adjourn the Parliament    so that he must put  a negative  upon his present  title  throughout all these pages  But to return to my subject I trust that the necessity of at least ONE SITTING of the parliament every year and of our  national right  to such SITTING is so sufficiently understood and acknowledged by the majo∣rity even of  all parties  that THE CONTRARY DOCTRINE which arises too apparently from Mr Hatsell's  manner of treating  the king's prerogative on that subject will need no particular refutation and yet so respectable is the authority of the writer not only by his office of  clerk of the house of commons  but also by the personal esteem which is certainly due to him from a very numerous and respectable body of friends and acquaintance that I thought myself obliged to take some notice of  his manner of treating  the subject before us in order to warn the public against  a possible  construction of it which might hereaf∣ter if not seasonably censured have dangerous consequences At the same time I sincerely profess that my censure is aimed more at this gentleman's  manner of writing  than his  intention  and that I am much more willing to believe that  the opinion he intended  to express was truly what Mr Lofft has  supposed  or that I myself may perhaps be mista∣ken in conceiving that his words are liable to a different construction rather than to suspect that the worthy clerk of the house of com∣mons could  really intend  to favour a doctrine which is repugnant to the established  usage of parliament  for near a century and is  equally  inimical to the just privileges of the  Lords  as to those of the  Commons  and of course to the welfare of the  whole nation  GRANVILLE SHARP  Old Jewry  May
