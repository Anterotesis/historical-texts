to public view  Some folly all forego  So Scythians shoot when they pursue  Or when they shun the foe  Statesmen and warriors the first  While those that court the Muse  And calm Philosophy more thirst  For peaceful life recluse  The lark that highest sings and flies  The lowest builds her nest  And she that warbles to the skies  In valleys seeks for rest  Consid'ring life with reason due  Good taste prefers a mean  And but for the discerning few  Would wish to live unseen  II RURAL REPOSE  NOW day declines and all is still  Save herds that homeward hie  The sunbeam fades on yonder hill  Soft as a farewell sigh  Blest mind that no rude tempest knows  But mov'd with joy serene  Sinks smiling into calm repose  Like ev'ning's gentle scene  But mortals turbulent and vain  Know nought of tranquil joy  Oft seeking to inflict a pain  Oft they themselves annoy  False hopes false cares fly high fly low  To flatter or affright  These trimm'd in fair and specious shew  Those like foul hags of night  Lo where ambition seeks to found  True pleasure on a name  Like taperfly still circling round  The giddy torch of fame  There thunder mighty heroes braves  Usurping sov'reign sway  The nation's kings tho' nature's slaves  Vain tyrants of a day  While here sweet peace with head reclin'd  Upon her downy wing  Eyes with a smile the cottage hind  Or hears him blythly sing  III ODE TO MODESTY  TUNE the lute and tune the lyre  These can life and love inspire  While the Muses touch the string  Mirth shall bashful merit bring  Modesty is joy concealing  Impudence is want of feeling  COME Modesty firstbidden guest  Who of thyself would'st come the last  Kind Love shall veil thee from the eyes  And insolence of ruder spies  And Taste fair Virtue's child entwine  A garland for thy brows divine  Happy he whose wishes find  Modest worth and love combin'd  Tune the lute and tune the lyre  These can life and love inspire  IN all things Modesty with thee  Good taste and temperance agree  True beauty knows no boastful glare  To make the superficial stare  Fond love Endymion like in sight  Prefers the moon's chaste modest light  To ruffian war loud sounds belong  Thou lov'st the soft Sicilian song  Tune the lute and tune the lyre  These can life and love inspire  NOT in rude bulk fair Beauty's Queen  Moves Goddess of a graceful mien  But in due figure unconfin'd  Denoting elegance of mind  But fools still hold an idle slate  And for the good admire the great  Thus oft ill actions gain acclaim  While modest worth is mark'd with blame  Tune the lute and tune the lyre  These can life and love inspire  NOR in vain greatness nor the voice  Of many thou conceiv'st thy choice  The foolish are a num'rous crew  The wise that worth esteem are few  From Mercury Love ever young  First learn'd fair fluency of tongue  But from Diana chaste to wing  The shaft and from the muse to sing  The gentle muse that shuns the croud  Ever violent ever loud  HAPPY he whose wishes find  Modest worth and love combin'd  Tune the lute and tune the lyre  These can life and love inspire  IV ON TRUTH  TRUTH boasts no supernat'ral light  Yet smiles at Fable's moral slight  And skilful in the rapt'rous art  Herself can sometimes bear a part  Daughter of reason pure and love  Ador'd by all who pleasure prove  Thy mild yet energetic ray  Like Hesperus at close of day  Not dazzles with excess of light  But charms while it directs the sight  Thou lov'st the unfrequented way  Where genius and fair science stray  V ESTIMATE OF TRUTH  HE truth alone can rightly prize  Who is himself maturely wise  To sottish drunkards those appear  Like sots who keep their senses clear  And those of coolest soundest brain  Are mark'd by madmen for insane  In superstition's sickly dream  Foul stains pollute the clearest stream  The modest voice of better sense  To snarling fools gives harsh offence  As much enrag'd the wild boar rears  His bristles when he music hears  ' Mongst Gods a Goddess Genius sits  A silent slave 'mongst meaner wits  VI ESTIMATE OF PLEASURE  PLEASURES moving human mind  Are of mix'd uncertain kind  Sometimes much on fate depends  Sometimes fancy marrs or mends  Treach'ry dress'd like Truth prepares  For the feeling heart her snares  Folly wearing Friendship's guise  Lends her ears to Slander's lies  What is merit's great reward  Save a cold or rough regard  What does life itself imply  Since all things that live must die  VII ON AFFECTATION  POOR Affectation how much better be  That which we seem than idly thus like thee  To seem what we are not Thy cheating art  Robs ev'n its owner of the better part  For when thou striv'st to please 'tis all in vain  And pain'd thyself thou giv'st to others pain  Twinchild of Treachery with deadly Guile  Disguis'd like thee in gesture look and smile  Slight ape of gracefulness without the grace  That mock'st the sympathies of human race  Lover and friend without love or esteem  Nothing to be but all things fair to seem  Endimpled so the whirlpool hides death's frown  As smiling on him whom it seeks to drown  VIII FOND HOPE  WHAT rapture would the Muse again inspire  What dear delusive hope what fond desire  Would she describe the chearful beams of morn  Or sadder sweets that ev'ning scenes adorn  Would she the charms of sacred beauty sing  Or ecstasies that heav'nly knowledge bring  What are the joys which nature yields or art  Unless those joys we freely might impart  But O sad thought a heart supremely kind  Seems but a vision of the lovesick mind  The longing of a soul whose hopes pursue  A counterpart that still eludes her view  So rare is truth affection's taste so rare  And bent on vanity most worldly care  IX RETIREMENT OF PHILOSOPHY  A SONNET  AS little springs that force their liquid way  From bottom of the everraging flood  Beat off rude waves and rising into day  To thirsty sailors prove a sov'reign good  So fair Philosophy thy deepdrawn streams  Pervade ev'n rankest tides of error foul  Dispel the rage of superstitious dreams  Imparting tranquil pleasure to the soul  Softpinion'd Peace attends thy simple state  Retires with thee to bow'r or rocky cell  The Sciences thy handmaids ready wait  With thee alone bright Truth delights to dwell  While all afar prevails the horrid rout  Which Scylla and Charybdis herds about  X THE DOUBLE MISTAKE  A SONNET  See a Poem of SHAKESPEAR intitled  Error in Opinion  ' TIS better to be good tho' ill esteem'd  And have the light tho' others lack the skill  To know what should or good or bad be deem'd  Or take for good what reason takes for ill  Must I cry lame because the cripple halt  Or feign me blind because the lame wou'd lead  Must I be senseless held for others fault  Or hold me dumb because the deaf not heed  Yet true it is too cheaply have I sold  That which to me has ever been most dear  And better had to better hearts been told  Than turn'd to falshood in a foolish ear  To some too freely would I truth have shewn  Their fraud unknowing I to them unknown  XI REVOLUTION OF ALL THINGS  THE gentle primrose leads the train  Of vernal flow'rs that grace the plain  The daisy and the vi'let lead  The summerblooms that scent the mead  The last of winter's hardy train  Lead on the laughing spring again  Nor first nor last we clearly trace  In the bright perennial race  All all in endless circles run  To the point where they begun  The planets whirl the sun about  Nor tell us where they first set out  All living things new shoots supply  And only in the old ones die  Mortals quickly too advance  In the neverceasing dance  Men ever in their offspring live  And as they get still freely give  Like the swift nightracing band  Who bear the torch from hand to hand  Giving life and labour o'er  To the youths who run before  The simile in the above alludes to an Athenian exercise of racing in which one person ran with a torch and delivered it over to the next in succession  All all in endless circles run  To the point where they begun  Nor first nor last we clearly trace  In the bright perennial race  XII ON A FLOWERGARDEN  SPARE O spare each smiling flow'r  Offspring of a fleeting hour  Let them live their little day  Man is transient too as they  Man who seeks with giddy joy  First to rear and then destroy  Let them wanton in the wind  Let them live to leave their kind  Still in brightest beauty seen  In their native couches green  So shall they fresh odours bring  Wafting sweets on Zephyr's wing  XIII SONG OF THE FATES  See in PLATO's REPUBLIC the Story of  Erus Armenus  IN garments white with crowns of gold  Preside the Sister Fates that hold  Their seats on high the world above  Beneath the throne of thund'ring Jove  Amid the Sirens in a ring  Alternate thus they spin and sing  ' Souls of a day  ' Away away  ' Another crop of mortal race  ' This quickly gone shall come in place  ' Turn the whirl the spindle turn  ' Mortals laugh and mortals mourn  ' HAPPY those who life employ  ' In social sense and genial joy  ' Far from horrid haunts of war  ' From rapine and injustice far  ' Turn the whirl the spindle turn  ' Mortals laugh and mortals mourn  ' LET wretches tremble at their fate  ' Who truth regard with ranc'rous hate  ' For Jove hath linked with their crimes  ' The dire events of future times  ' Turn the whirl the spindle turn  ' Mortals laugh and mortals mourn'  THE Sirenchorus join the song  And in full harmony prolong  ' Souls of a day  ' Away away  ' Another crop of mortal race  ' This quickly gone shall come in place  ' Turn the whirl the spindle turn  ' Mortals laugh and mortals mourn'  XIV SONNET ON THE DEATH OF A LADY  NOW western clouds appear of golden hue  Inlac'd with purple streaks of living light  And distant hills look dusky azure blue  Involv'd within the glimm'ring shades of night  Woods hamlets plains with sadness are o'ercast  Sol's parting rays play on the dimpling main  Amid the murmurs of the wint'ry blast  Like joyful spirits dancing in his train  The trees have lost their silken green attire  To foreign climes the heraldswallow flies  All silent drooping sit the tuneful quire  Or welcome newborn day in happier skies  These in their season soon shall glad return  But she no more alas for whom I mourn  XV ON SOFT MUSIC  SOFT music still affords relief  To gentle souls far gone in grief  Not such unmitigated woe  As only duller mortals know  Whose vi'lent sorrow may no longer last  Than morning dew or april show'r is past  But that much deeper mourning of the heart  In which the sacred Sisters bear a part  Like love sincere unchangeable remains  And inly soothes while yet the soul it pains  XVI ON AN AEOLIAN HARP  SWEET instrument whose wild notes can allay  The violence of passion's ruder sway  Thou by thy charming influence canst bring  Music from winds and teach them how to sing  O soothe a tender lover's soul to rest  And calm the tempest in his troubl'd breast  XVII TO THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD  O THOU eternal HARMONY of things  The rest and motion labour and repose  Of all by turns in their revolving course  Thou force cohesive and dissolvent pow'r  Relation REASON infinite immense  With humble reverence and silent awe  Let me thy light contemplate and thy love  Thou shinest in the di'mond and the dew  Of fragrant morn thou in the lilly shin'st  And in the vernal rose the higher orbs  The sun great source of light the moon serene  And all the starry host shine forth in thee  But ah how far surpassing these shine forth  The light of reason and the social sense  The sense of truth the sympathy of love  These in the wise are seen the wise in thee  Do live thou livest in the wise In these  Then let me worship thee not in dull rites  In speculative dreams and mysteries  Not in mouthpraises which the vain affect  But nature's pure simplicity and grace  In actions noble just beneficent  So shall I live love of thy love in thee  Who art the boundless ALL of LIFE and LOVE▪  FINIS
