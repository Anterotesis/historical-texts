huic nostrae similem  VIRGIL  DUBLIN Printed for W WILSON No at Homer'shead in Damestreet M DCC LXXVI  AN HEROIC ANSWER FROM RICHARD TWISS  Esq  FRS  FROM various perils of the land and main  By  Venus  wafted to  Batavia's  plain  Where kindly  ens and genial fogs surround  His  Pinna's  lines her anxious lover found  Not dearer tumults to my kindling heart  A fungus toad or tadpole could impart  Not with more joy some virtuoso spies  The first embraces of two foreign  lies  Whose deeds of love his eager fancy feed  With smiling omens of a lasting breed  Scarce to thy  Twiss  more transport could it give  To lodge in cellars or with pigs to live  Thy melting strains both pain and pleasure move  Pain for thine absence pleasure for thy love  I trac'd thy hand ev'n at a single view  Thy soul still better in the purport knew  Thy gentle lines I drank with eager haste  My lips pursu'd thee where thy fingers past  My tears bedew'd the lines my kisses dry'd  I sungI danc'dI fiddle'dand I sigh'd  Gods can it be too full too perfect bliss  Does then my  Pinna  still remember  Twiss  Is  Richard's  image to her fancy dear  And  Richard's  name still soothing to her ear  Now spend your malice curst  Hibernian  kind  For  Richard  lives within  Teresa's  mind  Rail write and rage I prize the sordid cry  Less than the hummings of the smallest fly  L  Hibernian kind  As to the natural history of the  Irish species  c  Twiss's Tour in Ireland Dub Edit p  Yet let me own appall'd I trod the ground  Where dangers lour'd and shames lay scatter'd round  A thousand tongues from stage to stage pursu'd  And fresh disgrace th' unwearied gibe renew'd  Thus down the chimney some poor sparrow strays  And roams the parlour with a wild amaze  Dogs cats and children a malignant crew  The hapless stranger round the room pursue  Some demon sure attends the youth who roves  To bogs and horseponds from the maid he loves  Oh I have much to tell and thou to hear  A tale of sorrows that will rend thine ear  Thy gentle spirit feels no vengeful flame  Thou little know'st the curst  Hibernian  dame  What thirst of vengeance fires an  Irish  maid  What ready arts that thirst of vengeance aid  Heav'n arms its creatures for their proper state  With various weapons of defence or hate  To serpents teeth to scorpions gave a tail  To me my printer and my leaden flail  Hibernian  dames are train'd to cuff and kick  And nature arm'd themfor their legs are thick  The thirst of vengeance ev'ry breast inspires  And bowls of whiskey feed their cruel fires  Lyaeus  thus the  Theban  dames possest  And goads and stings inflam'd the madding breast  "Revenge Revenge" the dire  Agave  cry'd  "Revenge Revenge" the vocal hills reply'd  Citheron's  summits heard the frantic shout  And  Pentheus  trembled at the revel rout  He scour'd he fled before th' inhuman train  In vainhis limbs bestrew'd th' impurpled plain  L  And nature arm'd them for their legs are thick  As to the natural history of the Irish species they are only remarkable for the thickness of their legs especially those of the plebeian females  T T I p  From forging franks each pert  Hibernian  Miss  Converts the quill and has her fling at  Twiss  The desp'rate inkhorn arms uncounted throngs  With puns and posies anecdote and songs  Revenge inspires them in  Apollo's  spite  A  Twiss  provokes and well or ill they write  How shall the muse to thee my fair explain  The studied vengeance of the savage train  What terms of art the secret shall declare  Inform thy mind and yet thy blushes spare  Hast thou not seen a vase of antique mold  Of  Parian  marble or  Barbaric  gold  Doom'd to enshrine some lovers cold remains  Or pour libations at some mystic fanes  Such are those utensils ordain'd by fate  The shameful engines of barbarian hate  Save that one handle more for use than pride  Shoots disproportion'd from the vessel's side  L  From forging franks  c The third custom is that of forging franks which is pretty universal the ladies in particular use this privilege  T T I p  For off'rings hallow'd which my charmer made  With purer zeal amid the citron shade  They grace the closet by the couch they stand  And night and morning load the fairest hand  Without a foliage crowns the polish'd frames  And burnish'd gold on flowers of purple flames  Within the potter plants thy  Richard's  face  And bids him stare in horrible grimace  Thro' lakes of amber as the face appears  The face repentant seems bedew'd with tears  The list'ning figure by the painter's skill  Attunes its fiddle to the purling rill  Sure had I trod the dire  Conatian  wild  The blood of  Twiss  had savage hands defil'd  L  Sure had I trod the dire  Conatian  wild  Neither did I go into that quarter of Ireland called Connaught which comprehends the counties of Mayo Sligo Leitrim Roscommon and Galway as I was assured that they were inhabited especially along the coast by a kind of savages and that there were neither roads for carriages nor inns Undoubtedly the chief towns of those counties are more civilized  T T I p  But heav'n in vision touch'd my trembling car  Some God inspir'd me with a prudent fear  A form methought half beast half human stood  And cry'd "My son I warn thee for thy good"  A mighty stinkpot in his hand appear'd  And ass's ears were on his temples rear'd  "Once like thyself I travel'd lied and wrote  "An author then tho' now a mountain goat  "But soon the victim of illmanners fell  "A youth of  Galway  hurl'd me down to hell  "Chang'd to a goat to travel mountains sent  "What was my pastime is my punishment  "If life is sweet the wilds of  Connaught  spare  "Beware of all of  Galway  most beware  "Yet thirst of railing greater than thy fear  "Will speak tho' vengeance threats the votive ear  "Untir'd intrepid as the taylor's wife  "Will deal invectives tho' they cost thy life  "The furious taylor plung'd her in the tide  "Her fingers rail'd when accents were denied  "In death unconquer'd shew'd the darling vice  "And seem'd to crack imaginary lice"  Not vainly was the warning fantom sent  My backward course with timely fear I bent  Yet still in dreams th' ideal terrours rise  Stain all my cloaths and seal my blacken'd eyes  And oaken cudgels whistle in the wind  And sharptoed shoes assail me from behind  Now  Pinna  seems to clasp me to her breast  Now pats my cheeks and whispers me to rest  With sticking plaister heals her  Richard's  scars  Disgraceful tokens of unequal wars  Or seems the lenient flannel to prepare  For love disdains not such a menial care  Foments my head still soft from weary blows  And regions livid from eternal toes  But say what springs this persecution move  The hate of woman for neglected love  Here droning pipes the tortur'd organs wound  And yells funereal thro' the vales resound  No lemon groves with harp and viol ring  No maids and striplings tonadillas sing  Their voice their touch disgrace the soft guitar  My catches mangle my cantatas mar  Let not thy bosom harbour jealous flames  My steady scorn repuls'd th'  Iernian  dames  My love of thee the love of music aids  I spurn th' addresses of untuneful maids  A thousand sonnets spoke the tender fear  But out of tune no sonnet reach'd my ear  Me more it charm'd with beggarwench to stray  In wanton dalliance all a summer's day  Thro' darksome lanes that vie with  Tempe's  vales  Where frequent dramshop balmy cloud exhales  And steaming whiskey trulls and butcher's boys regales  Whiskey that mantles in the sparkling glass  And blest  Nepenthe  chears the northern lass  I tun'd my fiddle with  Amphion's  arts  To melt and harmonize barbarian hearts  I would have taught the savage maids to move  In graceful dance that paints the joys of love  I would have taught them the guitar to string  To troll the tonadil the catch to sing  But screams of discord all my senses wound  And rule disdaining sharps and flats confound  This guilty cause inflam'd the wives of  Thrace  'Gainst thee musician of celestial race  To teach them catches hapless  Orpheus  strove  They scorn'd his fiddle but they sought his love  A song he gave them but a kiss deny'd  So bard and fiddle down the  Hebrus  glide  Each moment bade some indecorum rise  Some beastly custom shock'd my tortur'd eyes  Heav'ns how I tremble chill'd with panic fear  When waterglasses at the board appear  L Fandango which as Mr Twiss says  Est mel  de certaines attitudes qui offrent un tableau continuel de jouissance  L  When waterglasses at the board appear  The filthy custom of using waterglasses after meals is as common as in England it may possibly be endeavoured to be excused by pleading the natural unsociableness of the British who if obliged to withdraw to wash would seldom rejoin their company but then it may be urged that no wellbred persons touch their victuals with their fingers and consequently such ablutions ought to be unnecessary  T T I p  How shall the hapless traveller scape undrown'd  When direful females spout the table round  Yes  Pinna  yes conceive the soul disgrace  A mouthful oft was spurted in my face  Thus when a storm has plough'd the watery way  And whales in fulness of their bellies play  A thousand nostrils seem to threat the sky  And lab'ring barks the spouting deluge fly  Too well my love thou know'st the guilty shore  And "  perils such as never errant bore  "  And say what prize repay'd the toil and pains  What joy seduc'd me to the fatal plains  No speaking picture crowns the lordly dome  No breathing marble of old  Greece  or  Rome    No spreading towns the traveller's eye delight  No stately villas burst upon his sight  Along the road nor lord nor esquire waits  To tempt the traveller to his open gates  Fled the last honour of the savage kind  Their only boast the hospitable mind  Some once invited never ask'd me more  And some against me shut the niggard door  Some whisper'd while I play'd my fav'rite airs  And some more civil shew'd me down their stairs  But never will I mourn my toil and pains  My weary wanderings on  Hibernian  plains  Tho' drag'd thro' lakes or into rivers hurl'd  Since there I saw the wonder of the world  A wond'rous trout exalts one favour'd lake  And months and years I'd journey for its sake  L  A wond'rous trout exalts one favour'd lake  A species of trout called gilderoy are caught here and also in the neighbouring lake with a gizzard resembling that of fowls I have nothing more to say about this river except that  en passant  I took a dip in it  T T I  Of fish they talk'd with gizzard like a bird  I went by doubtful faint emotions stir'd  Heavens have I caught it rapture fires my mind  Gods Gods the gizzard of the winged kind  Here smack your horsewhips let your cudgels fall  Hibernian  Squires for this I'd scorn them all  I gain'd the trout the precious trophy bore  Preserv'd in whiskey from the magic shore  Haste haste ye sages ye whom nature fires  Gaze on my fish and satiate your desires  In vain his brethren seek a curious train  The darling treasure from thy  Twiss  to gain  For when my  Pinna Murcia's  bowers I see  Both trout and gizzard shall be fry'd for thee  Well might an artist travel from afar  To view the structure of a lowback'd car  A downy mattress on the car is laid  The rev'rend father mounts and tender maid  Some back to back some side by side are plac'd  The ravish'd maid by panting youth embrac'd  By dozens thus full many a Sunday morn  With dangling legs the jovial croud is borne  Clontarf  they seek or  Howth's  aspiring brow  Or  Leixlip  smiling on the stream below  L  To view the structure of a lowback'd car  Goods are conveyed about the city on small twowheeled cars drawn by a single horse the wheels are thin round blocks each about twenty inches in diameter The wheels of those cars which are used in the country are placed at a greater distance from each other than those of the city cars They are frequently used as vehicles for the common people on their parties of pleasure a bed or a mat is at such times placed on the car and half a dozen people sit on it with their legs hanging a few inches from the ground they are generally dragged a footpace  T T I p  L  Buvindus  The river Boyne  When ease and cheapness would thy  Twiss  engage  Cars he prefer'd to noddies or to stage  Oft on a car  Buvindus  saw me ride  From  Tredagh's  towers along his verdant side  Wonders like these of nature and of art  Midst all his suff'rings chear'd thy  Richard's  heart  And social comforts lent their genial rays  When some kind  Bufo  gave his port and praise  But why my  Pinna  kill me with thy tears  Thy causeless sorrows and thy idle fears  Wrong not my fair thy lover and thy self  What  Twiss  desert the  Murcian  maid for pelf  Yet say that gold could win thy  Richard's  charms  Or grandeur lure him from thy constant arms  Fear not a rival on th'  Hibernian  plain  I scorn its damsels a penurious train  Scarce by their portions are their gowns supply'd  And all their little wealth is dress and pride  No  Cupid  there his arrows tips with gold  Nor  Plutus  knits the bands that lovers hold  L  I scorn its damsels a penurious train  The Irish ladies are extremely well educated as they have little besides their beauty and merit to recommend them for wives their fortune in general being inconsiderable Men of affluent fortune who have consequently no need of being mercenary in their choice may find happiness in an union with these ladies provided they can convince themselves that they are disinterestedly accepted But on the other hand this polite education prevents many ladies from being suitably married for men of moderate fortunes cannot afford to maintain them in the style in which they were bred or  reared  often greatly superior to their station  T T I p  No wary souls in bonds of  Ind  are caught  No little loves arithmetic are taught  But homebred virtue lurks with idle stealth  And boasts in honour what it wants in wealth  Cease fond upbraider cease the melting sigh  For big with joy the teeming moments fly  Not long shall fate disjoin our plighted hands  Or hold thy  Twiss  from love's delicious bands  One only wandering for the youth remains  Then  Venus  wafts him to th'  Iberian  plains  Now fair occasion courts his swelling sails  To fish on  Greenland's  happy shore for whales  To strike th' harpoon uncoil the kindling line  To boil the blubber and the fat refine  L  No little love arithmetic are taught  There is a celebrated picture by Corregio on this subject  To roam with bears on drifted ice that live  'Till gentle converse full refinement give  'Till meet associates happy nature aid  And make him
