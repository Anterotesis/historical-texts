we have been in it another conclusion is that not knowing the paths we have come we know not where we areI know only that we are in a close walk of trees with houses at a distance we may be amongst people who pay no regard to genius science or invention but may put us all to death taking us for three witches that ride in the air  Fan  Oh Lord put us all to deathis all our fine ride in the air
