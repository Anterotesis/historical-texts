 REMARKS ON THE Opinions of some of the most celebrated Writers ON CROWN LAW Respecting the due Distinction between MANSLAUGHTER and MURDER  REMARKS On the Opinions of some of The most celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW Respecting the due Distinction between MANSLAUGHTER and MURDER  Being an attempt to shew  That the plea of  sudden Anger  cannot remove the imputa∣tion and guilt of  Murder  when a  Mortal Wound  is wil∣fully given  with a weapon  That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to  voluntary Manslaughter  in Rencounters and in sudden Affrays and Duels is  indiscriminate  and without foundation in Law  And that  impunity  in such cases of  voluntary Manslaughter  is one of the principal causes of the continuance and pre∣sent increase of the  base  and  disgraceful  practice of Duelling  To which are added some thoughts on the particular case of  the Gentlemen of the Army  when involved in such disa∣greeable  private  differences  With a PREFATORY ADDRESS to the Reader concerning the  Depravity  and  Folly  of  modern Men of Honour  falsely so called including a short account of the Principles and Design of the Work  BY GRANVILLE SHARP  LONDON Printed for B WHITE Fleetstreet and R HORSFIELD Ludgatestreet  MDCCLXXIII  And surely your Blood of your Lives will I require at the hand of every beast" or rather of every"  Animal  "will I require it and at the hand of Man at the hand of every Man's brother will I require the life of Man Whoso sheddeth Man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he man  Gen ix and  PREFACE  UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE including  gentleness patience  and an unaf∣fected  placability  in our behaviour even to∣wards those men who injure and affront us is manifestly required of all men who profess the true religion and yet unhappily for the Christian world this most obvious doc∣trine of the  gospel of peace  is too com∣monly either misunderstood or else abso∣lutely rejected though the  temporal  as well as the  eternal happiness  of mankind greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of it For a man can∣not be a true Christian without observing this doctrine and yet so generally received is the opposite and contradictory doctrine concerning the necessity of revenging every personal affront with sword and pistol for  the sake of what is falsely called  honour  that a true Christian is rarely to be met with Nay we are fallen into such gross depravity that the writer of a late pub∣lication on  "the principles of penal law"  has ventured to assert though he is in other respects as I am informed a sensible and in∣genious young gentleman that  the judge condemns the duellist whilst he scarcely knows how in his own heart to disap∣prove his behaviour  p    So that one would suppose Christianity to be almost entirely extinct amongst us if its principles are so little regarded  even in our courts of justice  where they ought to be held most sacred My readers perhaps will start at such an idea in these enlightened days of reformation but I will even go further and venture to assert that the Europeans not only cease to be Christians but will no longer deserve the name even of  men  if they persist in such a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the most indis∣pensible principles of the laws of God and nature for nothing deserves to be esteemed  human  that is  unreasonable  and the de∣pravity of which I complain is not only in∣compatible with the laws of God but ab∣solutely inconsistent with  common sense  Let us view the character of the  mo∣dern man of honour  falsely so called who thinks it inconsistent with his reputa∣tion to pass over a personal affront with that Christian submission which the gospel requires of all men without exception  Such an one perhaps will alledge that his  honour  obliges him whenever he re∣ceives an affront to  call out  his adver∣sary or  to accept his challenge  lest his  courage  should be questioned and therefore in such case the one must give and the other take what is commonly called  gentlemanlike Satisfaction  But let us examine this perversion of words The  Satisfaction  to both parties is the risk both of  body  and  soul  in the perpetration of a most  dishonourable base  and  cow∣ardly felony  which cannot therefore be  gentlemanlike  whatever the  satisfaction  of it may be It is  Felony  because no man can give or accept a challenge with∣out being guilty of  Wilful Murder  if he  kills  his antagonist which I hope is proved in the course of the following tract  dly It is  dishonourable  because it is an open violation of the indispensible prin∣ciples enjoined in the two great command∣ments of the supreme Law viz the  love of God  and the  love of our neighbour  for in this respect the offender is upon the same foot∣ing as culprits for  burglary theft  or any other felony the  not having the fear of God before his eyes  being equally  applicable to all of them and the common law of England esteems no man qualified to be a member of society who wants this principle The act is therefore highly  dis∣honourable  and to use a still more humi∣liating term of the same import I must ob∣serve Thirdly that it is also  base  because it affords the most apparent proof of a  little Soul  Nec Christiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt sed et philosophi qui dixerunt  pusilli esse animi con∣tumeliam ferre non posse  ut alibi ostendimus  says the learned Grotius in his d book De jure Belli et Pacis p  being  in reality  a  brutal  revenge  brutal  because  unreasonable  for how can  Honour  be vindicated or retrieved by the com∣mission of a  notorious Felony  and what is  unreasonable  must be disgraceful to hu∣man nature and therefore is truly  base  And lastly it is  cowardly  that is when it can∣not be imputed to  Ignorance  or  Folly  be∣cause a man submits to it contrary to the light of his own reason  for fear  his  courage  should be called in question and yet  he has not courage enough  to withstand the bar∣barous prejudices of a depraved world lest he should suffer some temporal inconvenien∣cies and  the slavish Fear  which he enter∣tains of these for  cowards  always dread the present evil most deprives him of that  reasonable fear  which he ought to entertain of God's judgment because he thinks it at a distance though he knows it must inevita∣bly followI condemn no man in particular God forbid I speak of the question only in ge∣neral inveterate prejudices and customs may perhaps afford some excuse in particular cases to some  Individuals  who have  igno∣rantly  yielded thereto but as  ignorance  is disgraceful to  humanity  I sincerely wish that all persons may enter into as careful an examination of this question as I have done by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime but also  be prevented from attempting to defend what is past and thereby afford the best proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart  This abominable practice of duelling which of late years has increased to a most alarming degree may chiefly be attributed I humbly conceive to the improper indul∣gence which our English courts of justice for about two centuries back have shewn to persons  convicted of killing in sudden affrays and rencounters  through a false idea of mercy due to human frailty in cases of  sudden provocation  without pre∣serving the proper distinction of those cases wherein homicide in  sudden anger  is really excusable by the laws of God and of this kingdom and the improper precedents which have arisen from this  indiscriminate and corrupt practice  have so misled the more modern writers on  Crown Law  that  even the greatest and most respectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doctrines on the subject of Manslaughter which are absolutely incompatible with the  proper  and  necessary distinctions  to be ob∣served between  wilful murder  and  man∣slaughter  which they themselves have laid down in other parts of their works and it is on the authority of these just  distinctions  with the necessary consequences arising therefrom and not on my own presumption that this censure is founded which the following tract I hope will clearly demon∣strate  But as my readers might seem to give too much credit to an inconsiderable person like myself were they without a previous intimation of what is proposed to risque any loss of time in the perusal of the argu∣ments and proofs at large on which my  vindication for this attempt depends I think it my duty to state the subject and intention of the tract as briefly as I can in this pre∣fatory address that my readers may thereby be enabled to judge without much loss of time whether the matter is of suf∣ficient consequence to merit any more of their attention  I have already mentioned my opinion that  No man can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight  with weapons  on any private difference whatever without being guilty of  wilful murder  if he  kills  his antagonist  And the intention of the following tract is to shew that the writers on Crown Law have no just war∣rant for admitting the contrary doctrines which they have laid down concerning  sud∣den affrays  and  rencountres  viz that  the voluntary killing  of a man on a  sudden  provocation  is only to be esteemed  Man∣slaughter  and as such is intitled to the be∣nefit of clergy And they have also supposed that  an assault  is a sufficient provocation to justify a  voluntary manslaughter  Now certain it is that some allow∣ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a  sudden provocation  in considera∣tion of the extreme frailty of human na∣ture provided that there are no circum∣stances of  malice  in the case As if for in∣stance a man  in sudden anger  should strike another merely  with his fist  or a small  cane  or  stick  meaning only to correct and should  accidentally kill  this would be properly  manslaughter  which tho' it is deemed  Felony  as the act of striking or beating another person is in itself  unlaw∣ful  is nevertheless  pardonable  both by the laws of God and man But when two persons fight with  dangerous weapons  an  intention of killing  is  expressed  by the  weapons  and  such intention  renders the manslaughter  voluntary  which is the same thing as  wilful  and consequently the  "ma∣lice prepensed"  which excludes the be∣nefit of clergy is necessarily  implied  though the sudden anger be but a moment before the fatal stroke for  "malice prepensed"  is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke  That is says he  voluntary  and of set pur∣pose though done  upon a sudden occa∣sion  for if it be  voluntary  the law implieth  malice    Inst  c xiii p  And yet the same great lawyer in p    speaks of  voluntary manslaughter  upon  some sudden falling out  as distinct from  murder  which cannot in reason be true for if the  killing be voluntary  the evil and  malicious intention  is necessarily in∣cluded in the act even though the fatal blow be given merely with  the hand  or a  small cane  or  stick  which I have before mentioned as pardonable cases when the  killing  is not intended for a  voluntary striking  without intention to kill is indeed pardonable though death ensues but a  vo∣luntary killing  is so far from being so that the law according to lord Coke's own rule  implieth malice  and consequently the same must necessarily be esteemed  Murder  and not meerly  Manslaughter  because the necessary marks whereby  manslaughter  ought to be distinguished are absolutely wanting therein for  manslaughter  must be "without  malice  express or implied"    Hale    Blackstone    "  Murder  being ag∣gravated" says lord Hale  with malice presumed or  implied  but manslaughter not  And yet all these great and excel∣lent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the same error of treating the  voluntary branch  of killing as bare  Homicide  or  manslaugh∣ter  whereas all the oldest writers agree that  killing  is pardonable only in cases  of inevi∣table necessity  Bracton lib  iii  c    p    b Fleta lib  i  c    And the learned judge Staunford says  That the whole matter consists in the  inevitable necessity  without which the  killing  is by  no means excusable  n'est ascun voi excus∣able  P C lib  i  c      Now the absurd and depraved notions of  honour  and  gentlemanlike satisfaction  of which I complain could not possibly exist if every conqueror in a duel who kills his antagonist was sure of being  hanged up  as an ignominious  felon  for his own  gentlemanlike satisfaction  and there∣fore I apprehend that the diabolical practice of settling private differences with sword and pistol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of punishment due to  voluntary man∣slaughter  through the mistaken concessions of the Writers on Crown Law and the false  mercy of Juries in consideration of  sudden anger  because  impunity  fosters vice and depravity but more especially in cases of  wilful manslaughter  impunity ought to be esteemed the bane of society as  the guilt of blood  is thereby thrown upon a whole na∣tion or country for it is a supreme law that  whoso sheddeth  man's blood  by  man  shall  his blood  be shed  Gen  ix  And I hope I have proved by incontrovertable extracts from the laws of God that the said judgment is inevitably incurred by all  voluntary killing  except in the legal pro∣secution of justice and in the necessary de∣fence of our lives and properties so that  no Man on earth  and much less in Eng∣land  For in England not only the laws of God but the laws of the land forbid the pardoning of  wilful manslaughter  so that even  the king himself  is abso∣lutely restrained from it See an act of the Edw III whereby it is ordained that a charter of pardon  shall not be granted but only where the king may do it by his oath that is to say where a man slayeth an∣other in  his own defence  or  by misfortune  has any legal or just right to par∣don  or remit the punishment due to  mur∣der  or  voluntary manslaughter  which are the same crime and equally  unpardon∣able  in this world for such an indulgence is not only a manifest sin against Almighty God but also against the community at large or country  for  Blood it defileth the land  and the  land  cannot be cleansed of  the blood  that is shed therein but  by the blood of him that shed it  Numb  xxxv  This is not a ceremonial law but a law of morality founded in divine justice which must therefore be ever binding  I may probably be charged with an un∣pardonable temerity for presuming to cen∣sure the writings of some of the greatest and most learned men that this nation per∣haps ever produced and I am thoroughly sensible of the risk and ill consequences to  myself in case I am mistaken but a sincere persuasion of being in the right arising from a laborious research and careful ex∣amination of the most celebrated and ap∣proved writers on Crown Law obliges me to prefer what I conceive to be  truth  be∣fore the authority of the greatest names  And even though I should not have suc∣ceeded according to my own conceptions of the subject yet I trust that my impartial readers will pardon any  involuntary errors  that they find in the performance especially if they see no cause to suspect any want of uprightness in the intention of it and at all events I hope that the attempt may at least be considered as a proof that I am not afraid of difficulties and labour nor of the risk of personal inconveniences when I un∣dertake any point with a view of serving my country or mankind in general  OLD JEWRY  d Sept  GRANVILLE SHARP  REMARKS c  NO MAN can give or accept a chal∣lenge to fight  with weapons  and  kill  his antagonist on any private difference whatever without being guilty of  Wil∣ful Murder  such as ought to be excluded from the benefit of clergy For  Wilful Murder  is the killing of a man  ex ma∣litia praecogitata  Pleas of the Crown p also Hal P C  which  malice  is either  implied  or  express  Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace p Lambard's Eirenarcha c p also Inst c vii p  or as judge Hale calls it  Malice in Law  or  ex presumptione Le∣gis  Hal P C  and  malice  must necessarily be  im∣plied  when a man  wilfully strikes  or wounds another with any  offensive weapon  whatever because that is  an act that must apparently introduce harm  P C p  and the intention to do harm  makes it murder  Ibid  so that the allowance which the writers of the two last centuries have made for  sudden anger  without preserv∣ing a proper  distinction  of the case where∣in it really deserves consideration is un∣just in itself as well as dangerous to so∣ciety for few men would entertain such absurd notions of honour as to think themselves obliged to revenge affronts with their  swords  or  pistols  if they were  sure  to be hanged up as felons and murderers for their own  gentlemanlike satisfaction  In every charge of murder  the fact of killing being first proved  all the circum∣stances of Accident Necessity or In∣firmity  are to be satisfactorily proved by the prisoner unless they arise out of of the evidence produced against him for the law presumeth the fact to have been  founded in malice  until the contrary appeareth  Judge Foster  The cases of homicide which are justifi∣ed or excused by the abovementioned  cir∣cumstances  of  Accident  and  Necessity  are well understood and by many eminent writers sufficiently explained under the heads of  Misfortune  and  Selfdefence  But with respect to those cases of Homicide which are attended with circumstances of  infirmity  the third branch of circumstan∣ces mentioned above thewriters on crown law in general have been very indiscrimi∣nate notwithstanding that the true dis∣tinction between  Murder  and  Manslaughter  depends entirely on a clear stating of those  cases of  infirmity  which really deserve consideration and excuse  Judge Foster indeed is for the most part nice and accurate in his distinctions yet he has paid so great a regard to the authority of  precedents  that he has been unwarily led away as well as other wri∣ters from the necessary conclusions of his own arguments upon this point I shall nevertheless make use of his words as far as they express my own opinion of the subject  Whoever would shelter himself under the plea of  Provocation  must prove his case to the satisfaction of his jury The presumption of law is against him till that presumption is repelled by contrary evidence What degree of  Provocation  and under what circumstances Heat of blood the  Fu∣ror brevis  will or will not avail the Defendant is now to be considered  Words of Reproach how grievous soever are not a Provocation suffi∣cient to free the Party killing from the  guilt of murder  Nor are indecent pro∣voking actions or gestures expressive of contempt or reproach  without an assault upon the person  p But I think myself obliged to add that even  an assault  See my Remarks in p c on Mr Haw∣kins's assertions relating to this point  upon the person  is NOT  a Provocation sufficient to free the Party killing from the  guilt of murder  though this learned judge seems to think otherwise See Sect iii p un∣less all the circumstances which are ne∣cessary to render it excusable by the plea of  selfdefence  can clearly be proved For if  the Killing  in a sudden fray is not  ex necessitate  as in Selfdefence or in the lawful Defence of others it must be esteemed  voluntary  and  voluntary  is the  same thing as  wilful  which necessarily in∣cludes "  malice  For Bracton says  Cri∣men non contrahitur nisi  Voluntas no∣cendi  intercedat voluntas et propo∣situm distinguunt  Malificium  c lib iii c So that  malice  must necessarily be  presumed  whenever the  killing  is not  ex necessitate  especially if the fatal blow be  wilfully  given with  a weapon  for in that case a man must necessarily be supposed to strike  "cum occidendi animo"  because the  Voluntas nocendi  is apparent and consequently the  malice  in such a case is not only  implied  but clearly  expressed  so that the  sudden anger  is only a further proof of  the malice  and "  intention  to do harm"  Bracton has accurately laid down the proper distinction to be observed in the plea of  an excusable Necessity  for killing  Quo casu distinguendum est utrum  Necessitas  illa fuit  evitablis  vel non Si  autem  evitabilis  et evadere posset abs∣que occisione tune erit  reus homicidii  and a felonious  homicide  or  manslaughter  in the days of Bracton had the same meaning that we now apply to  Murder    Si autem  inevitablis  quia occidit homi∣nem sine odii meditatione  in metu do∣lore animi  se et sua liberando cùm ali∣ter    mortem propriam  Fleta lib I c  evadere non posset non tenetur ad poenam homicidii  Bract lib iii c And Staunford remarks that  the necessity  ought to be so great that it ought to be esteemed  inevitable  or otherwise it shall not be excused so that the whole mat∣ter consists says he in the  inevitable necessity  without which the  killing is by no means excusable  Nota que la necessite doit etre cy graunde que il doit estre existimé  inevitable  ou autrement il n'ex∣cusera c eins tout la matier consist in le  inevitable necessite  sans quel  le tuer  n'est  ascun voi excusable  Staunford PC lib i c  so that the learned judge Foster certainly goes too far when  he insinuates in the passage before cited "that  an assault  upon the person" with out mentioning the necessary exception concerning  inevitable Necessity    is a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder  For a farther distinction besides that of  ine∣vitable necessity  is also to be observed which is very accurately laid down even by judge Foster himself in p though the same would be useless if  an assault upon the person  was to be admitted as a  sufficient provocation  to the act of  killing  It ought to be remembred says he that in all other cases of homicide upon slight provocation  But I have already shewn that  no provocation  whatever can justify a  voluntary  or  wilfull killing  if it may be rea∣sonably collected  from the weapon  made use of or from any other circum∣stance that the Party  intended to kill  or to do some great bodily harm  such  Homicide  will be Murder The mischief done is irreparable and the outrage is considered as flowing rather from  brutal rage  or  diabolical malignity than from human frailty  And it is to  human frailty  and to that alone the Law indulgeth in every case of felonious Homicide  The first Instance which he gives by way of illustration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale Vol i p If  A  come into the wood of  B  and pull his Hedges or cut his wood and  B  beat him whereof he dies this is  man∣slaughter  because tho it was not lawful for  A  to cut the wood it was not lawful for  B  to beat him but either to bring him to a justice of peace or punish him otherwise according to law  But here Lord Hale is not suffi∣ciently distinct in stating the case because Circumstances are wanting which are ne∣cessary  for the determination of such a case whether it ought to be esteemed  manslaughter  or  murder  The accurate judge Foster was sensible of this want of  necessary circumstances  and therefore adds  But it must be understood says he that he beat him  not with a mischievous intention  but meerly to chastise for the trespass and to deter him from committing the like For if he had knocked his Brains out with  a bill or hedgestake  or had given him  an outrageous beating  with an ordinary cudgel beyond the the bounds of a  sudden resentment  whereof he had died  It had been Murder  For these circumstances are some of the genuine symptoms of the  Mala Mens  the heart bent upon mis∣chief which as I have already shewn enter into the true notion  of Malice  in the legal sense of the word  p  The next instance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horse's tail Which was says he  held to be murder  " "For it was a deliberate act  and savoured of cruelty  But the third instance viz that of Stedman the soldier killing a woman  with a sword  which judge Foster mentions as a case that  was held clearly to be no more than manslaughter  was most certainly  wil∣ful murder  for though it appeared that the woman had struck the soldier on the face with an iron patten yet she after∣wards fled from him and he  pursuing  her  stabbed her in the back  Now if such a case of  wilful killing  is to be esteemed only manslaughter it entirely perverts the just arguments already quoted from the same author concerning the cases wherein  human frailty  deserves to be  indulged  May I not use his own words against him  That "these circumstances" the pur∣suing and stabbing the woman in the back  are some of the genuine symp∣toms of the  mala mens  the  heart bent upon mischief  Whereas if he had  struck her  merely with his fist or with a small stick  not likely  to kill and had unluckily and against his  intention killed  it had been but  manslaughter  For this is the necessary distinction for which I contend  in all cases of killing  where the  striking  not the killing is  voluntary  and I cannot so well express my meaning as in the words of judge Foster himself though that sensible and acute reasoner is afterwards misled from the truth of his own doctrine by paying too much regard to the practice of the Courts which in this point has frequently been erroneous  In page after the st section already quoted concerning the cir∣cumstances which  are not a pro∣vocation  sufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder  he adds  This rule will I conceive says he govern every case where the Party Killing upon such provocation  maketh use of a deadly weapon  or otherwise  manifesteth an intention to kill  or to do some great bodily harm But if he had given the other a box on the ear or had struck him with a stick or other weapon  not likely to kill  and  had unluckily and against his intention  killed it had been but  manslaughter  The difference between the cases is plainly this In the former  the malitia the wicked vindictive disposition  already mentioned  evidently appeareth  in the latter it is  as evidently wanting  The Party in the first transport of his pas∣sion intended to chastise for a piece of insolence which few spirits can bear In this case the benignity of the law interposeth in favour of human frailty  in the other its justice regardeth and  punisheth the apparent malignity of the heart  p and  Nevertheless the same author in p endeavours to excuse killing in  sudden rencounters  without preserving this necessary distinction concerning  the use of a deadly weapon  and  the intention to kill  To what I have offered says he with regard to  sudden rencounters  let me add that the blood already too much heated kindleth afresh at every pass or blow And in the tumult of the passions in which  meer instinct selfpreservation  hath no inconsiderable share the voice of reason is not heard And therefore the law  in condescension  to the infirmities of flesh and blood hath extenuated the of∣fence  But  the Law  in reality makes no such  condescension  though  the Courts of  Law  have indeed  indiscriminately  done so and have occasioned a multitude of bad precedents wherein  wilful murder  has been excused under the name of  manslaughter  and this unhappy differ∣ence between  the Law  and the corrupt practice of  the Courts  with respect to this point has unwarily led the more mo∣dern writers on crown law into conces∣sions which are absolutely contradictory to the just doctrines laid down in other parts of their excellent works  When I speak of such respectable and justly revered authors as Sir Edward Coke Sir Matthew Hale lord chief justice Holt c No person can conceive that I am misled by per∣sonal or party prejudice against their opi∣nions and as I have really the highest esteem and veneration for their memory not only as great and learned lawyers but as true patriots and above all as sin∣cere  Christians and worthy honest men I should not presume to controvert any point that has been laid down by such excellent lawyers  so accomplished as above  was I not armed by  their own authority  for  no other authority  issuf∣ficiently authentic for the purpose of cor∣recting such deservedly esteemed wri∣ters though I must acknowledge my obligation to the more ancient writers for the discovery of the errors of which I complain  The proper distinction to be observed between  murder  and  manslaughter  is well laid down by Sir Matthew Hale  Mur∣der  says he being aggravated with malice  presumed  or  implied but man∣slaughter  Not  Hale's P C  This rule is good and unexceptionable and therefore it must appear that even Sir Matthew Hale himself is mistaken in  the paragraph preceding this quotation where he says that  Manslaughter  or  sim∣ple homicide  is the  voluntary killing  of another without  malice express  or  impli∣ed  for though there may be a  volun∣tary striking  without  malice  yet I hope I have already proved that there cannot be a  voluntary killing  without  malice express  or  implied  except in the legal execution of jus∣tice and in the case of  selfdefence  and its several branches which some writers ra∣ther improperly have indeed called  vo∣luntary  Lambard's Eirenarcha Sir Edward Coke's Inst p and  though they proceed from an  inevitable necessity  See the note in page  Nevertheless even the great Sir Edward Coke and before him the learned Lambard in his Eiren∣archa p was guilty of this same impropriety of expression  Some manslaughters says Sir Edward Coke Inst cap viii p  be voluntary  and not of  malice forethought  upon some  sudden falling out  Delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mi∣tius And this for  distinction sake  says he is called  manslaughter  But it is a very  indiscriminate distinction  if I may use such an expression concerning the writ∣ings of so great a man because the maxim "Delinquens per iram" c can only be admitted in cases where the  malice  is  neither express  nor  implied  for instance when the  Striking  is  voluntary  but the  Killing  or  Manslaughter  is  invo∣luntary  and  unexpected  as when a man  in sudden anger  gives an unlucky blow merely with his fist or with a small stick or small stone  See judge Foster's comment on Rowly's case wherein the difference of striking with a  dangerous weapon  and with a small stick or  cudgel not likely to destroy  is well expressed pages and  I have always thought Rowly's case says he a very extraordinary one as it is reported by  Coke  from whom  Hale  cites it The son fights with another boy and is beaten he runs home to his father all bloody the father takes a staff runs three quarters of a mile and beats the other boy who dieth of this beating This is said to have been ruled man∣slaughter  because done in sudden heat and passion  for which he cites Rep and Hale "Surely" continues judge Foster  the provocation was not very grievous The boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him and was worsted a disaster slight enough and very frequent among boys If upon this provoca∣tion the father after running three quarters of a mile had set his strength against the child had dispatched him with  an hedgestake  or  any other deadly weapon  or by repeated blows with his cudgel it must in my opinion  have been murder  since any of these circumstances would have been a plain indication of the  malitia  the mischievous vindictive motive before explained But with regard to these circumstances  with what weapon  or to  what degree  the child was beaten  Coke  is totally silent But  Croke  setteth the case in a much clearer light and at the same time leadeth his readers into the true grounds of the judgment His words are Rowly struck the child with a  small cudgel  Godbolt calleth it a rod meaning I suppose  a small wand  of which stroke he afterwards died I think it may be fairly collected from  Croke  's manner of speaking that the accident happened by  a single stroke  with a cudgel  not likely to destroy  and that death did not immediately ensue The stroke was given in heat of blood and not with any of the circumstances which import the  malitia  the malig∣nity of the heart attending the fact already explain∣ed and therefore  Manslaughter  I observe that lord  Raymond  layeth  great stress  on this circum∣stance  That the Stroke was with a Cudgel not likely to Kill  meaning only to correct  which  undesignedly  occasions death for in such cases the  malice  is not  implied  whereas in a  voluntary homicide  even a  Malice prepensed  is implied according to Sir Edward Coke's own definition of that term viz  That it is  voluntary  and of set purpose  though it be done upon a Sudden Occasion  for if it be  Voluntary  the law  implieth Malice  Inst c xiii p Sir William Black∣stone has also fallen into the same error in his th vol chap xiv p where he informs us that Manslaughter is  the unlawful killing of another with∣out malice either  express  or  implied  which may be either  voluntarily  upon  a sudden heat  or involuntarily but in the commission of some  ununlawful act  In both of which he is also mistaken for with respect to the latter his doctrine cannot be admitted except in cases where the circumstances of the  unlawful act  amount only to  a bare trespass  Which he himself elswhere allows  Judge Foster in his second discourse of homicide p where he treats of  involuntary homicide  in the commission of an  unlawful act  informs us  that if it be done in the prosecution of a  felonious inten∣tion  it will be  Murder  but if the intent went no farther than to commit  a bare trespass  Man∣slaughter Though I confess says he lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise  That is Lord Coke did not even make an allowance for  "a bare trespass"  but seems to have been of opinion That every case of  invo∣luntary homicide  is to be treated as  Murder  whenever the act which occasions death may be esteemed  unlaw∣ful  See Inst p to which judge Foster refers But that learned judge could not mean that he differed in opinion from lord Coke concerning the first case there stated under the head of  unlawful  viz the unlawful shooting at a deer whereby a boy was killed by the glance of the arrow because that case must necessarily be esteemed  Murder  according to judge Foster's own rule abovementioned for lord Coke has clearly stated a  felonious intention  viz  A meaning  to steal  a deer in  the park  of B c  It must therefore appear that he refers only to the d case there mentioned of a man shooting at a cook or a hen or any  tame fowl of another man's  for a person might wantonly shoot at another man's pigeons or poultry without any in∣tention to  steal them  which I conceive would amount to no more than  a bare trespass  in judge Foster's sense of the word because "voluntas et propositum distin∣guunt  maleficia  furtum  vero non committitur  sine affectu furandi  Fleta lib i c p Whereas if lord Coke had added in the supposed case that there was an intention  to steal  the tame fowl judge Foster could not reasonably have dissented from his opinion because the crime must necessarily have been adjudged  Murder  according to his own rule for the very same case has been so laid down by lord chief justice Holt in a very clear manner see pages and of this tract in order to explain lord Coke's assertion tho' Judge Holt himself is as apparently mistaken in his Judgment of the other Case wherein the occasion was an intention to  steal a Deer  which is at least as  felonious  as the intention of  stealing a Hen  that is if the Deer be tame and  inclosed  in  a Park  as stated by lord Coke by which the  property  is rendered ap∣parent but if the case had been stated that the Deer was in a  Forest  or open chase the offence  without the accident  would be only a  Trespass  See Hawkins P C Book i c xxxiii § and the idea of this latter position may probably have occasioned lord Holt's mistake for this circumstance would have ren∣dered the  accidental Killing  of the Boy only  Man∣slaughter  agreeable to his opinion Compare pages and wherein Lord Holt's opinion of these Cases are mentioned  For I propose in the  course of this tract to mention several allowed cases on good authority where∣in  even the  involuntary  or undesigned kill∣ing is not deemed  manslaughter  but  mur∣der  when the acts which occasioned death were  unlawful  and with respect to the former it is a manifest  inconsistency  in all these great writers to rank  voluntary killing  under the head of  manslaughter  in the modern  confined  sense of that  once gene∣ral  term because a  voluntary killing  ex∣cept in the case of  selfdefence  through ine∣vitable necessity which some writers have rather improperly called  voluntary  Lambard's Eirenarcha "The last member says he of  voluntarie homicide  is where one man kill∣eth another in his  own defence  c" and Sir Edward Coke speaking of selfdefence in Inst p and says "this is  voluntary  and yet no felony" Sir Mat∣thew Hale is more accurate for when he speaks of homicde  ex necessitate  he informs us  that this necessity makes the homicide not  simply voluntary  but mixed partly voluntary and partly involuntary and is of two kinds  c vol  is  certainly the same thing as a  wilful kill∣ing  and either of them must be allowed to be the proper definition of what we now understand by the term  Murder  though the meaning of that word was originally very different See le Mirroir de justice c i sect xiii p and Lambard's Eirenarcha c vii p be∣cause in  a voluntary or wilful killing ma∣lice  is necessarily  implied  and conse∣quently  voluntary killing  is excluded from the favour due to manslaughter by the rule which these learned writers them∣selves admit  viz  that manslaughter is without malice  express  or  implied  so that they are really guilty of a  contradiction in terms  because the  malice  or  inten∣tion of killing  is  undeniable  if the  kill∣ing  be  voluntary  And where a man doth any cruel and  volun∣tary act  whereby death ensues  it is murder though done of a sudden  See a little book dedicated to lord Bathurst in intitled The  Laws  of Liberty and Property p  and therefore as it is a maxim that  Allegans con∣traria non est audiendus  Jenk Cent fo I am compelled to reject the definition of  manslaughter  given by these learned writers as far as it is contradictory to that excellent rule already cited for the distinction of  manslaughter  from  mur∣der  which they themselves admit viz that  manslaughter is without malice ex∣press or implied  The errors of which I complain were not originally occasioned by thefe cele∣brated authors but by a previous corrupt practice in the courts which had been in∣troduced by degrees and at last unhappily prevailed through a false idea of mercy  and consideration for  sudden anger  and also through the want of preserving the  pro∣per distinction  of cases wherein  manslaugh∣ter  in  sudden anger  is really excusable The proper distinction to be observed is when the  intention  of  killing  is not necessarily  implied  in the act itself as when a man strikes another merely with his hand or fist in sudden anger or thrusts him sudden∣ly from him whereby he falls and receives a hurt which occasions death in these and similar cases the striking or thrust∣ing is indeed  voluntary  yet the  killing  or  manslaughter  is not so but entirely un∣designed and unexpected which proper and necessary distinction the Law Com∣mentators have unhappily neglected For though the act of  striking or thrust∣ing in anger  bears some resemblance to  malice  and though such an act is cer∣tainly  unlawful in itself  yet it is reason∣able to make some allowance for the  frailty of human nature and the sudden passion of a man that is provoked when∣ever  a more criminal malice  is not neces∣sarily  implied  in  the act itself  which oc∣casions death And in this lenity we are justified by the laws of God whereby such cases of manslaughter  in sudden anger  as I have mentioned were excused without any other penalty than that of banishment to a city of refuge  If he  thrust  The thrusting  here mentioned which some wri∣ters seem to have misunderstood does not mean a  thrust  with a sword or other weapon for the word  has no such meaning but properly signifies a violent thrusting or shoving away as with the hand or a suddendriving away as chaff is drove before the wind as Bythner remarks  Proprie dicitur de vento qui rapta prosequitur  Lyra prophetica p  him  suddenly    without  enmity  Here a proper distinction is preserved between  sudden anger  and  enmity    Numb xxxv the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge c  v Yet the very same action if done  in hatred    see the th verse and even a blow with  the hand  in enmity    see the st verse apparently meaning when there was any  express proof of malice  or inten∣tion to kill were to be deemed  unpar∣donable  "he shall surely die"  But it is remarkable that these are the  only  two  cases  wherein  an express proof of malice  was required for in all the examples given in the same chapter of killing  with a weapon  or with  a stone wherewith a man may die  meaning such a stone as from its shape or size might be deemed a sufficient weapon to occasion death there is not the least mention made of  malice    Hatred or  Enmity which is a sufficient proof that the same were necessarily  implied  from the stroke when given with a  weapon  for in that case the command was peremptory  If he smite him with an instrument of iron  so that he die he is a  murderer    Retsch or Killer perhaps from thence the English word  wretch    the  murderer  The Word  Murder  was anciently understood in the same  general sense  as the Hebrew  to kill so that judge Foster is mistaken when he says p that  our oldest  writers made use of the term  murder  in a very narrow limited sense  The Sense was  afterwards  indeed restrained to  hidden  man∣slaughter whereof the author was not known but in later times it was still once more changed to the sense in which it is at present understood viz that of  wilful manslaughter  wherein  "malice prepensed"  is either  express  or  implied  See Lambard Book c vii p and  In old time says he every killing of one man by another was of the effect called  murder  because death ensued of it For as Pos∣tellus noteth of the Hebrew worde  Moth  came the Latine  Mors  and thereof our elders the Saxons called it  and  as we now found it Afterward about the time of M Bracton murder was restrained to  a secret killing only  and therefore he in the definition of murder saieth that it is  occulta occisio  c with whom Britton agreeth also But since the statute Edw III c by which the presentment of  Englesherie  was taken away  Mur∣der  is taken in a middle degree neither so largely as it first was nor so narrowly as it afterward be∣came to be For  Murder  is now construed to be where one man of  malice prepensed  killeth an∣other feloniously that liveth within the realme under the protection of the queene whether it be openly or privilie and whether the partie slayne be English or alien  And then he proceeds to shew that the  "malice prepensed"  may be either  apparent  or  implied  shall surely be put to death  v the same also if he smote him with  a stone wherewith he may die  or with  an hand weapon of wood  But in none of these cases is there the least mention of  malice  which was therefore most certainly  im∣plied  and the  congregation  to which our trials  per Pares  are in some degree similar were to judge  according to these judgments  see th ver For the slayer was not  to die until he stood before the congregation in judgment  see th verse and then if it did not appear that the killing was at  unawares    in error see th verse or as the same meaning is expressed in different words in Deut  XIX  ignorantly  or  without knowledge  agreeable to the example there laid down for all other cases of mere  misfortune  As when  a man  goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die  c Deut xix or as it may rather be rendered the  iron glanceth from the tree  and  findeth  his neighbour that he die  which corresponds in some measure with that less explicit case mentioned in Exodus xxi where God is said to  deliver him into his hand  or rather to make him  meet his hand  as Mr Haak trans∣lated it in as if a man should accidentally come in the way of a stroke that was aimed at some other object for  as God is the Lord of life and death whose Providence is over all his works the scripture teaches us to ascribe to him all such events as in common phrase are called  accidental  Dr Dodd And so Castalio translates the passage  In eum fortefortuna incurrerit  which he further explains in a note as follows  In Hebraeo est  Deus ejus manui injecerit  Sed Deus pro  fortuna  Hebraicè ideo dici∣tur quod quae putant homines  casu fieri  utpote quae non praeviderint ea  Dei  providentia fiunt cui nihil fortuitum esse potest c  The learned Selden who was most deservedly esteemed for his knowledge in the laws both of God and men supposed also that the text in Exodus xxi might relate to  invo∣luntary homicide  and he accordingly refers to it from his first division of that head  Prima est quando  ex errore    ignorantia  simplici atque infor∣tunio nec tamen sine culpa levi ex negligentia ali∣qua qualem prudentiores seu cordatiores fugerent contracta omnino interea  nolens quis  hominem occiderat juxta illud in lege sacra Exod xxi Qui non est insidiatus sed  Deus tradidit illum in manum ejus  ponam tibi locum quo confugiat  I Tom Tract de Jure Naturali Gentium cap ii  de homicidio involuntario  seu quod casu factum ac errore c  the malice was pre∣sumed  from the  weapon  with which the stroke was made for  the hatred  and enmity  were never enquired after in any cases where a  wilful  stroke was given with  an instrument of iron  or  "a weapon of wood"  or even with  a stone wherewith a man may die  that is if it were such a stone as was apparently capable of occasioning  the death of a man see Numb xxxv to all which crimes were unpardon∣able by the law of God  he shall surely die  And the Levitical Lawis certainly in this point  still binding  even under the dispensation of the gospel because the reason and justice of it still subsists as in other  moral laws  So that the allowance usually made for  sudden anger  when the blow is  given with a weapon  is so far from deserving the name of  a proper distinction in the crime of killing  as some contend that it is apparently founded in  a want  of that  proper distinction  which the laws of God and reason require concerning cases of  manslaughter  wherein  sudden anger  is really excusable which can only be  when  the killing  is not  voluntary  or at least  the intention of killing  not apparent as in the cases beforementioned of a man striking another merely  with his hand  See a case supposed by judge Holt in his edition of Kelyng's Reports Regina versus Mawgridge  Suppose says he upon provoking language given by B to A A gives B a box on the ear or a little blow with a stick which happens to be so unlucky that it kills B who might have some imposthume in his head or other ailment which proves the cause of his death this blow though not justifiable by law but is a wrong yet it may be but  man∣slaughter  because it doth not appear that he  de∣signed  such a mischief  or fist in  sudden anger  or the sudden  thrust∣ing  See the case of Thompson and Daws cited by lord chiefjustice Holt in the case  Rex versus Plu∣mer  Kelyng p  Thompson  thrust  away Daws and threw him down upon an iron in the chimney which broke one of his ribs of which he died this upon a special verdict was held to be  only manslaughter  though the peace was broke and the person slain came only to keep the peace and it is the same if he had been constable  that is if he did not declare his intention as it is after∣wards explained and charge the offending parties in the king's name to keep the peace This case is pro∣perly  excuseable manslaughter  because it did not ap∣pear that the  killing  was  voluntary  though the "  thrusting  away" was  voluntary  and therefore the  malice  or intention was neither  express  nor  implied  as in  murder  a man down by which he is hurt  in falling so that death unexpectedly ensues In these and similar cases  the malice  or the  intention of killing  is not necessarily  implied  in the action itself and therefore if all the other circum∣stances are also free from premeditated  malice  and laying in wait the law has reserved a  reasonable  use of an  unreason∣able  popish indulgence called The Bene∣fit of Clergy to relieve the  undesigning manslayer  if the occasion was not  unlaw∣ful  from the too great severity of the common law for in such cases we may safely admit Sir Edward Coke's maxim  Delinquens per iram provocatus pu∣niri debet mitius  Inst  But a false idea of mercy and consi∣deration for  sudden anger  unhappily pre∣vailing in the Courts this lenity was  in∣discriminately  extended even to cases where the  prepensed malice  was necessa∣rily  implied  by the stroke so that the wretch who stabbed his neighbour in  brutal anger  escaped with impunity to the scandal of public justice The bad effects of this  false mercy  and injustice became so notorious in the reign of King James I that the legislature was obliged to seek a remedy and a statute was then made I Jac I c by which the benefit of clergy was taken away from  the offence of  mortally stabbing  an∣other though  done upon sudden provo∣cation  Judge Blackstone's Com b  c xiv p But unfortunately this remedy proved almost as  indiscriminate  as the abuse intended to be corrected by it for it takes no notice of any other crime than that of  stabbing  as if  sudden anger  was not  equally criminal  when a man is killed  by throwing a hammer or other weapon  or by  "a shot with a pistol"  Ibid p Whereas in truth no new law was wanted nothing but a better ad∣ministration of the old laws beforemen∣tioned for in all such furious sallies of  sudden anger  the  malice  was necessarily  implied  or  presumed from the weapon  as well in the laws of God which I have already shewn as in the law of nations  Ex telo praesumitur malum consilium  says the learned Grotius  nisi contrarium appareat  And in his second book de Jure Belli Pacis he remarks that either  iron a club or a  stone  comes under the denomination of a weapon  Teli  autem nomine  ferrum sustis lapis  venit  c i p  The reason of the severity in the di∣vine law against striking  with a weapon  is well expressed by Dr Wells in his paraphrase on Numbers xxxv to  Forasmuch says he as tho' he might have no malice to him beforehand yet his striking him  with a sword  or  hatchet  c shews he had  an inten∣tion  to do him mischief  and as Dr Dodd remarks  though perhaps he had no  formed intention to kill  the person yet he ought to have moderated his passion and could not be ignorant that  such an instrument  was capable of inflicting  a deadly wound  And therefore when a man is  killed with a weapon  except it be by  misfor∣tune  or in  selfdefence  Regularly it is necessary that the person that kills another  in his own defence  fly as far as he may to avoid the violence of the assault before he turn upon his assailant for tho in cases of hostility between two nations it is a reproach and piece of cowardice to fly from an enemy yet in cases of as∣saults and affrays between subjects under the same law  the law owns not any such point of honour  because the king and his laws are to be  vindices in∣juriarum  and private persons are not trusted to take capital revenge one of another  Hale p  when the Slayer could retire no further to save himself without striking or else in such law∣ful and reasonable cases wherein a man is not obliged to give back as in the case of a peace officer  If a gaoler be assaulted by his prisoner or if the sheriff or his minister be assaulted in the execu∣tion of his office  he is not bound to give back to the wall  but if he kill the assailant it is in law adjudged  se defendendo  tho he  gave not back to the wall  The like of a constable or watchman  c Hale p For which he quotes Co P C p Co Rep b Machally's case  who is assaulted in his duty or when any other man endeavours  to keep the peace  On il purra dire que il le tua en defendaunt  nostre pees  c  Britton p b  or to save another person from violence and oppression  For it is the duty of  every man  to interpose in such cases for preserving the public peace and pre∣venting mischief  Foster p for which he re∣fers to Stanf Inst And in the latter place there are several cases mentioned wherein  a pri∣vate person  may lawfully interfere  by warrant in law without writ  Lord Hale also allows that  every man  is bound to use all possible lawful means to prevent a felony as well as to take the felon and if he doth not he is liable to a fine and imprison∣ment therefore if B and C be at strife A a by∣stander is to use all lawful means that he may without hazard of himself to part them c If A be travelling and B comes to rob him if C falls into the company he may kill B in defence of A and therefore much more if he come to kill him and such his intent be apparent for in such case of a felony attempted as well as of a felony committed  every man is thus far an officer  that at least his kill∣ing of the attempter  in case of necessity  puts him in the condition of  se defendendo  in defending his neighbour  Hale p  Ou il purra dire que tout fist il le fait nequedent ne le fist il mye par felonie purpense mes par necessite soy defen∣daunt  ou sa femme ou sa meason ou sa meyne ou son seigniour ou sa dame de la mort  c  Britton p bAnd again  ei qui justè possidet licitum erit cum armis contra pacem venientem ut expellat  cum armis  repellere ut per arma tuitionis et pacis quae sunt justitiae repellat injuriam et vim injustam et arma injuriae sed tamen cum talis discretionis moderamine quod injuriam non committat non enim poterit sub tali pretextu hominem interficere vulnerare vel male tractare  si alio modo suam tueri possit possessionem  Ei igitur qui vult viribus uti erit viribus viriliter resistendum cum armis vel sine juxta illud  Cum fortis armatus c  Bract l c b  or  a woman  A woman in defence of her chastity may law∣fully kill a person attempting to commit a rape upon her The injury intended can never be re∣paired or forgotten  c Foster  in the necessary defence of chastity or when any person resists the attack of a Robber  Thorp dit que  chescun home peut prender larons  et s'ils ne voilent soi render mes estoient al defens ou fuont in tiel cas  il les peut occire sans blame  Staund∣ford p Also  If a theif assault a true man either abroad or in his house to rob or kill him  the true man is not bound to give back  but  may kill  the assailant and it is not felony  Hale p for which he quotes Co P C p But this rule is subject to just restrictions for  even a thief  is not to be  killed  but through  necessity  "Si alio modo suam tueri possit possessionem" c See the preceding quotation from BractonJudge Hale indeed seems to think that a thief may lawfully be killed if he cannot otherwise be taken  If a person says he be in∣dicted of felony and flies or being arrested by warrant or process of law upon such indictment escapes and flies and will not render himself where∣upon the officer or minister  cannot take him without killing of him  this is not felony  c  But if he  may be taken without such severity  it is  at least manslaughter  in him that kills him there∣fore the jury is to enquire whether it  were done of necessity or not  Hale for which he cites E Coron Assiz Stamf P C lib cap fol b But this doctrine requires some further restriction for the  Necessity  of  taking  a thief or retaking a prisoner or that of executing a civil writ is not so great as to justify  killing  when the person endea∣vours to escape merely by flight the  Necessity  can only be founded  in his resistance  from which no man is bound to give back and this will appear by Lord Hale's own words in another place viz  But if the prisoner  makes no resistance  but flies yet the offi∣cer either for fear that he or some other of his party will rescue the prisoner strikes the prisoner whereof he dies this is  murder  for here was no assault first made by the prisoner and so it cannot be  se defendendo  in the officer  And again  If a man be in danger of arrest by  a capias  in debt or trespass and  he flies  and the bailiff kills him  it is murder  c Hales The same point is still more accurately explained by judge Foster chap p  I rather choose to say says he it will be  murder  or  manslaughter  as circumstances may vary the case For if the officer in the heat of the pursuit and meerly in order to overtake the de∣fendant should trip up his heels or give him a stroke with an ordinary cudgel or other weapon  not likely to kill  and death should unhappily ensue I cannot think that this will amount to more than  Man∣slaughter  if in some cases even to that offence The blood was heated in the pursuit his prey  a lawful prey  just within his reach and no signal mischief  was intended  But had he made use of a  Deadly Weapon  here is the proper distinction for which I contend  it would have amounted to  Murder  The mischievous vindictive spirit the  Malitia  I have already explained which always must be collected from circumstances determineth the nature of the offence  I say excepting  these and similar cases if a man  will∣fully  strikes another  with a weapon  in  sudden anger  the design  of killing  is by the  weapon  rendered  express  as I have  before observed though the  prepensed malice  may perhaps more properly upon a  sudden provocation  be said to be  implied  and it certainly is  implied  or  pre∣sumed  in law though the  sudden anger  was but a moment before the fatal stroke so that if no proof can be produced by the prisoner of  an inevitable necessity  as in  se defendendo  the act must in reason and justice be deemed  wilful murder of malice prepensed  such as was sufficiently excluded from the benefit of clergy by two express acts of parliament Hen VIII c and Edw VI c xii pre∣vious to the undistinguishing act of James I against stabbing  By an act of the Edw III it was or∣dained that a charter of pardon  shall not be granted but only where  the king may do it by his oath  that is to say where a man slayeth another  in his  own defence  or by  misfortune  Now with respect to the first case viz  in his own defence  or  se defendendo  all writers both antient and modern agree that the killing of a man must be  "It must be  inevitable necessity  " Pleas of the Crown p "upon  an inevitable cause  " d Inst chap p and  but care must be taken that the resistance does not exceed the bounds of  mere defence  and  prevention  for then the defender would himself become an aggressor  Blackstone  this is not excuseable  se defendendo  since there is no  absolute necessity  c Blackstone  Eins toutla matier consist  in le inevitable necessite  sans quel  le tuer n'est Ascun Voi Excusable  Staun∣ford P C lib c  He must flie so farre as he may and till he be letted by some wall hedge cthat his  necessitie  of defence may be esteemed altogether  great and inevitable  c Lambard's Eiren c P See note in p  ine∣vitable  and that the manslayer must be able to prove that he retired and that he was obliged  ex necessitate  to strike in order to save his own life a plea  which cannot be admitted in favour of a Man who has accepted a challenge or who has drawn his sword in  sudden anger  merely to revenge an affront  And with respect to the second  pardonable case  mentioned in the said act of Edw III viz  by Misfortune  I must observe that there are some cases of homicide that may even be said to happen  by misfor∣tune  or  without intention  which are nevertheless deemed  Murder  And the severity of the law in this respect will enable me by comparison to point out more clearly the absurdity and injustice of excusing homicide in consideration  of sudden anger  when the mortal stroke is given  with a weapon  in rencounters  The cases of  Misfortune or Accident  which are deemed  Murder  are those  wherein the act which undesignedly oc∣casions death is in itself  unlawful  For if the act be  unlawful  I mean if it be Malum in se the case will amount to felony either  murder  or  manslaughter  as circumstances may vary the nature of it If it be done in prosecution of  a felonious intention  it will be  Murder  but if the intent went no further than to commit  a bare trespass manslaughter  Judge Foster p  Though I confess says he Lord Coke seemeth to think otherwise    If the act be  unlawful  says lord Coke it is  murder  Asif A meaning to steal a deer in the park of B shooteth at the deer and by the glance of the arrow killeth a boy that is hidden in a bush  this is murder  for that the act was  unlawful  altho' A  had no intent  to hurt the boy  nor knew not  of him  Inst Lord chief justice Holt indeed says it is but  manslaughter  in which he is mistaken  See note in p and Judge Holt's own opinion on another case quoted in p  See his Edition of Kelyng Rex versus Plumber But whether  this be deemed  murder  or  manslaughter  the  killing  is merely accidental or by  misfortune  and therefore is certainly a much less crime than that of aiming at and striking a man  with  a  weapon  or shooting at him in  sudden anger  howso∣ever great the previous affront may have been For in the former case though the  shooting  at a  deer  belonging to an∣other person is both  unlawful  and  vo∣luntary  yet the  manslaughter  which it accidentally occasions is  involuntary  and without intention whereas in the  volun∣tary  aiming and shooting at a man the act itself is not only  unlawful  but  im∣plies malice  or rather I may say the  malice  is  expressed  by the act and the  sudden anger  is so far from being an  ex∣cuse  that it is absolutely a further proof of the  malice  and  intention  of  killing  The  malice  was also  implied  in the case of the lord Dacres though his lordship  was not half so criminal in  his unlawful hunting  as the passionate man who strikes  with a weapon  See how the case is mentioned by lord chief justice Kelyng Rep p  The Lord Dacres and Mansell and others in his company came  unlawfully  to hunt in a  forest  Judge Kelynge is mistaken in this point for the lord Dacres probably would not have been treated with such severity if  the Trespass  had been in a  Forest  or open chace but it was in a  Park  belonging to Mr Pelham in Surry Crompton so that the  unlawful  Hunting was more than  a bare trespass  See note p and See also Hawkins cap xxxi § where another Ground for the imputation of  Murder  in that case seems to be assigned viz a Resolution of Divers Persons to resist all opposers in the commission of  a breach of the peace  though it be only as he calls it a  bare breach  of the peace  and being resisted one of the company when the lord Dacres was a great way off  and not  present  killed a man judged  murder  in him  and all  the rest and the lord Dacres  was hanged  Lord chief justice Holt supposes a case in his Rep of Rex versus Plummer p in the same book which is in some de∣gree similar  So says he if two men have a design to steal a hen and the one shoots  at the hen  for that purpose and  a man be killed  it is  murder  in both because the  design was felonious  See also the last paragraph of p Inst concerning the shooting at a  tame fowl  of which this case supposed by judge Holt is an explanation But surely  the design  must be much more  felonious  when a man  wilfully  strikes his neigh∣bour  with a weapon in sudden anger  because this must necessarily be allowed to be an act  committed  felleo animo  with a  fell furious  and mischievous  mind  and  intent  which is Lam∣bard's definition of  felony  c vii p  The  implication of malice  in the owner of a beast that kills a man after warn∣ing given will also further illustrate what has been said for though mere carelessness or inconsideration might oc∣casion his neglect so that the accident may in some degree be esteemed a  mis∣fortune  yet the law implies  malice  for if one keep a mastiff dog says Sir James Astry in his charge to grand juries p that is used to bite people near the common highway or bull or beast that hath hurt any one after notice they kill any one  that will be murder in the Owner  altho' not present when the fact was done and yet in this and the other precedent cases here is no  express malice to be proved  but what the law construes to be so  this  is agreeable to the doctrine of judge Staunford P C lib i cap  Que si home ad un jument que est accus∣tomé a male faire et le Owner ceo bien sachant negliga luy eins luy suffra d'aller a large et puis le jument tua un home que ceo  est felonie  in le owner eo que per tiel sufferance  le owner semble daver volunté a tuer  See also Crompton p b and Hawkins c xxxi § And according to Bracton the Common Law  imputes  the death of a man by a beast to any man who follows or drives the beast at the time of the misfortune  vel dum insequitur quis equum  vel bovem  et aliquis  a bove  vel  equo  percussus fuerit et hujusmodi  hoc imputatur ei  Bract lib iii c iv p b If this law were still enforced we should not have such continual complaints of acci∣dents in the streets by cattle that are en∣raged and made mad through the cruelty of the twolegged brutes who drive them  For the first step that ought to be taken in such cases is to seize  the drivers  and nineteen times out of twenty it will be found that the poor beast will reco∣ver itself when they are gone from the excess of fear and rage which the the Brutality of the  hurrying Drivers    Si quis operam rei dederit illicitae ut cum quis  Boves

the guilt is to be  imputed  but yet even a brutal driver is not so base and detestable as the man who wilfully strikes  with a weapon  in sudden anger And again he who aims to strike or shoot  at a man  and accidentally kills a  dif∣ferent person  whom perhaps he did not see contrary to his intention or  by misfor∣tune  as it were is nevertheless deemed guilty of  wilful murder  though he had not the least  anger  or resentment against  the  person killed  Homme sagitta a un  ex malicia praecogitata  et luy misse et tue autre qui estoit decost et a qui nad malice unc'il est  murder  eo que il  ad intent  de  mur∣der  Crompton's edition of Fitzherbert's Justice of Peace p  As if a man says judge Holt out of malice to A shoots at him to kill him but misses him and kills B it is  no less  a  murder  than if he had killed the person intended  Lord chiefjustice Holt's Rep of Rex versus Plummer in Kelyng's Rep p for which he quotes Dyer p Cromp p Plowden's Com p Saun∣ders's case Rep Agnes Gore's case  But surely the man who  actually kills  the person  he aims at in his anger  is at least as culpable so that if  sudden anger  deserves no lenity in the for∣mer case it certainly deserves none in the latter Several cases also are mentioned by Sir William Blackstone wherein  sudden anger  is not excusable even though the death may be said to be  "by misfortune"  as there was no real  intention of killing yet rendered by the circumstances  equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter  See  Comment b iv chap xiv p and  Also if  even upon a sudden pro∣vocation  says he one beats another in a cruel and unusual manner so that he dies  though he did not intend his death  yet he is guilty of  murder  by an  express malice that is by an  ex∣press  evil design  the genuine sense of  ma∣litia  As when a parkkeeper tied a boy that was stealing wood to a horse's tail and dragged him along the park when a master corrected his servant with an  iron bar  and a schoolmaster stamped on his scholar's belly so that each of the sufferers died these were  justly held to be murders  because the cor∣rection being excessive and such as could not proceed but from a bad heart it  was equivalent to a deliberate act of slaugh∣ter  But is not  an express evil design  as apparent in the act of striking a man with  a weapon in anger  be the  anger  ever  so sudden as it is in these cases where death was  not really intended  For surely the  design of killing  is by the weapon ren∣dered  express  If one executes his revenge upon  a sudden pro∣vocation  in such a cruel manner with a  dangerous weapon  as shews a malicious and deliberate intent to do mischief and death ensues it is  express malice  from the nature of the fact and  murder  Wood's Inst Book p And this must always be the case when men presume to decide their quarrels  with dan∣gerous weapons  be quarrels  even so sudden or unpre∣meditated  for the  "malice"  is by the weapons  expressed  and the  "malice prepensed"  is therefore  im∣plied  which equally fulfils  "the genuine sense of malitia"  though perhaps the  prepensed malice  may more properly  upon a sudden provocation  as above be said to be  implied  than  express  But whether it be  express  or  implied  it undoubtedly constitutes  murder  for  malice  is the leading circumstance which distin∣guishes  manslaughter  from  murder  and  therefore  an express evil design  such as is apparent in the  voluntary killing  of a man cannot be admitted under the head of  simple homicide  or  manslaughter  because the necessary difference is wanting  in the degree of the offence  according to the ex∣cellent rule before cited from Sir Mat∣thew Hale viz  murder being ag∣gravated with  malice presumed or im∣plied  but manslaughter  not  c Hale P C  I may probably seem guilty of much tautology in this little Work but hope my Readers will excuse it in consideration of the necessity I am under of repeatedly comparing the Crimes of  striking with a weapon  in  sudden Anger  and of  voluntary Killing  with so many other different cases wherein even  involuntary  and  acci∣dental  Killing have been solemnly adjudged  Murder  and I apprehend that  the seve∣rity  of the Law in the lastmentioned cases must sufficiently demonstrate such  a general abhorrence in our Law  to the shedding of  Human Blood  that we can∣not reasonably suppose  the same Law  ca∣pable of admitting an excuse for  volun∣tary Manslaughter  on any private differ∣ence howsoever great the provocation Nevertheless Mr Hawkins ventures to assert a very different doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown Book c xxviii §  I see no reason says he why a person who without Provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever in such a Manner as plainly shews an intent to murder him as by discharg∣ing a Pistol or pushing at him with a drawn Sword c may not  justify Kill∣ing  such an Assailant as much as if he had attempted to rob him for is not he who attempts to Murder me says he more injurious than he  who barely attempts to rob me And can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my Life And it is not only highly agreeable to reason that a Man in such circumstances may  lawfully Kill  another but it seems also to be confirmed by  the general Tenor of our Lawbooks  c  But howsoever specious this argument may appear I hope I have already pro∣ved  "by the general Tenor of our Law∣books"  that the  Justifiable Killing  of a Man must be through  an inevitable necessity  and therefore what Mr Haw∣kins afterwards advances in his com∣parison of such a case with Homicide in  se Defendendo  cannot in the least justify either his opinion on that point or his assertion concerning  the general Tenor of the Lawbooks  He endeavours to represent  the Volun∣tary Killing  of a Man as  Justifiable Ho∣micide  and consequently he must sup∣pose it a less crime than  Excusable Ho∣micide  in  se Defendendo  He founds his opinion in the suppo∣sition of "some  precedent Quarrel  " in the latter "in which" says he  both parties always are or at least may  justly be supposed  to have been in some fault so that the necessity to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another is in some measure pre∣sumed to be owing to himself  c  But may it not as  "justly be supposed"  that the person who  Kills  without  such ne∣cessity  is also  "in some fault"  Is not the  Presumption of Law  against him as I have elsewhere shewn by the  bloody  FACT when he cannot prove that  he endea∣voured  at least to retreat in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed And is not FACT a more substantial ground for a criminal charge than any idea that a Court can possibly form concerning the  Murderous Intentions  which  the Killer  may attribute to  the person Killed  The single circumstance that  the Killer  was under  no necessity  of endeavouring to retreat and avoid the assailant is not only a proof that  his own intentions  though he might not be the first aggressor were nearly as criminal as those he attri∣butes to the  person Killed  but it also af∣fords a strong presumption that  the latter  was not very strenuous or sanguine either in his attack or in his supposed  inten∣tion to commit murder  so that the very pretence by which Mr Hawkins en∣deavours to justify such a  voluntary Kill∣ing  must necessarily fall to the ground  whenever  the Killer  is unable to prove that he endeavoured to avoid the attack  I have already made the necessary exceptions con∣cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of jus∣tice c  And though the Deceased might have had  "a Weapon Drawn"  yet that cir∣cumstance affords no positive proof of his  criminal intention  for he might have thought himself obliged to draw in his own defence through a reciprocal suspi∣cion of his adversary's  criminal intentions  and as he cannot plead his own cause it is reasonable that the Law should  presume  that he really did draw in his own de∣fence especially as the circumstance that  the Killer  was under no necessity of en∣deavouring to avoid him affords a suffi∣cient Ground for such  a presumption  And even in cases where it may be supposed that the  person Killed  might  really have had  "an intent to murder"  we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not punish men  merely  for their  "criminal intentions"  without some fact and therefore it would be highly absurd to suppose that the Law without some apparent necessity would entrust every individual indiscriminately with a supream Authority which it de∣nies  even  to the Highest and most solemn Courts of Justice I mean an Authority to inflict capital punishment without a previous Trial  per pares  and that mere∣ly for  "a Criminal Intention"  which in many cases might as easily through fear passion or violent prejudice be mistaken or imaginary as be real  And therefore  an Assault upon the Person  is not as I have before in∣sisted in p against the opinion of Judge  Foster  a Provocation sufficient to free  the Party Killing  from the Guilt of Murder  The case of Gentlemen in the Army nevertheless seems peculiarly hard upon such unhappy occasions The first prin∣ciple of their profession is  Courage  and the World in general is too de∣praved to distinguish in what cases a Man of  true Courage  may retreat  with honour  from the Assault of an Enemy so that Military Men are liable to be  un∣justly  despised whenever they act  rea∣sonably  in cases either of insult or as∣sault  Yet at the same time it ought to be remembered that those men who submit to  the Slavish Yoke  of other Men's de∣praved opinions or unreasonable customs  in contradiction to that  natural Know∣ledge  of  Good and Evil  which they in∣herit in common with the rest of Man∣kind from our first Parents cannot  justly  be deemed  Men of Honour  and conse∣quently are unworthy of  Rank  in the honourable Profession of Arms And though such men may support an out∣ward  appearance  of  Courage  in the eye of the world by  daring  to violate the Laws of God and Man in  private  Quarrels yet that very act affords the most manifest token of the Want of  real  and  steady Courage  for unless the submission to that depraved custom can be attributed to  inconsideration or  to  the want of Know∣ledge  it must necessarily be supposed that the  Duellist had not sufficient Courage  to assert his  natural Right  of Acting agree∣able to the Dictates of his  own reason and conscience  and was  unable to face the Ter∣rors  of  an  adverse Fortune  in a good Cause  and therefore like a wretched  Coward  he yielded himself a prisoner and slave to the fashionable Depravity  I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels sometimes Passion and false Pride but more frequently in∣consideration and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man as I have before hinted occasion the base submission and conformity to those  false  and  unreasonable notions of Honour  which almost universally prevail  Nor do I so much blame the Military Gentlemen for this unnatural depravity as I do the Professors of the Law who ought to have set them a better example and yet have rather contributed to  the ignorance of the times  by the many  gross perversions  of  our Law  which they  have admitted into the Books Gentle∣men of the Army are not obliged in∣deed to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law but they must not forget that they are  Men  as well as  Soldiers  and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of  Men  viz that of thinking for themselves and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their  own Conscience  as Members of the Community they are unfit for  British Soldiers  of whom the  Law  requires an acknowledgment of  her supremacy  For the Law will not excuse an  un∣lawful Act  by a Soldier even though he commits it by  the express Command  of the highest military Authority in the King∣dom and much less is the Soldier obliged to conform himself  implicitly  to the mere opinions and false Notions of  Honour which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted Even in pub∣lick military Service or warlike Expe∣ditions by  National authority  the Law manifestly requires the Soldier  to think for himself  and to consider before he acts in any war whether the same be  just  for if it be otherwise the Com∣mon Law of this Kingdom will  impute  to him  the Guilt  of  Murder  And though the Law does not actually punish such general Crimes as may un∣fortunately have obtained at any time the Sanction of Government yet the time will certainly come when all such temporizing military  Murderers  must be responsible for the innocent blood that is shed in an  unjust  War if they have ren∣dered themselves  accessaries to it by an im∣plicit  and therefore  criminal  obedience  to the promoters of it  Item fit Ho∣micidium  in Bello  says the learned Bracton  et tunc videndum utrum  Bellum  sit  justum  vel  injustum  Si au∣tem  injustum  tenebitur occisor si au∣tem  justum  sicut  pro defensione pa∣triae  non tenebitur nisi hoc  fecerit corrupta voluntate et intentione  Bracton Lib c  de Corona  p    Men of  true honour  therefore at the same time that they are sensible of their duty as  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to their King must be mindful that they are  subject also to the empire of reason  and are bound thereby in common with all mankind to maintain the  dignity  and  natural freedom  of Human Nature and those Soldiers who in addition to their natural reason have a true sense of Religion will not only be mindful that they are Soldiers and  Subjects to an earthly King but that they are also  Soldiers  and  Subjects  to  the King of Kings  whose Laws and precepts they will on all occasions prefer  to every other command  and will obey the same with such a  steady courage  as may be equal to every adversity and undeserved suffering that threatens them  It was this indispensible this happy disposition and sense of  superior duty  which prevailed even in an unlawful stand∣ing Army that had been  raised  and was  expresly designed  for arbitrary purposes and which nevertheless contrary to all expectation exerted itself in saving this Kingdom at the Glorious Revolution from the Political Slavery which then threatened it as well as from the more intolerable Tyranny of the Romish Re∣ligion  The Soldier therefore who has not  Courage enough  to profess on all occasions a strict obedience to the  Laws of his Country  according to the dictates of his  own reason  and  Conscience in preference to every command and every other opinion what∣ever  is unworthy of the British military service being qualified rather to be in∣listed with the slavish Troops of the  Grand Monarch  of France or to serve in the Black Banditti of the Emperor of Morocco  But I must return once more to the opinions of the Professors of Law  it is said  This opinion is in the true stile of a  Tradition  such as those by which the Jews of old  "perverted the Law"  that if he who draws upon an∣other  in a sudden Quarrel  make no pass at him  till his sword is drawn  and then fight with him and  Kill him  he is guilty  of  Manslaughter  only  c Haw∣kins Pleas of the Crown c xxxi § for which he quotes Kelynge and but  the pretence  for this indul∣gence is as  frivolous  as the Doctrine is  false  viz  because says Mr Hawkins that by neglecting the opportunity of Killing the other before he was on his guard and in a condition to defend himself with like Hazard to both he shewed that his  intent  was not so much to  kill  as to  combat  with the other in compliance with those  com∣mon notions of Honour  cBut is "not the intent  to kill  " or to do some bodily harm and certainly at least the Risque of  Killing  included in the intention  "to Combat" with dangerous weapons  And is it  Justice  Nay is it  common Sense  to excuse a  Notorious Crime  by the Plea of an  intention  to commit another Crime almost as bad  I have already shewn by fair com∣parison with a variety of cases that the crime of wilfully  striking  or  Combating with weapons in sudden Anger  is a much more  unlawful act  than many others wherein even  involuntary and accidental Homicide  has been solemnly ajudged  Murder  and has been generally admitted as such by the Sages of our Law in their Reports and it will therefore be highly disgraceful to our Law but more parti∣cularly because  deservedly  to the pro∣fessors of it if they should still persist in the  unreasonable  and  unjust  practice of pu∣nishing  lesser  Crimes with  more  severity than the crying  Sin  of  voluntary Man∣slaughter  which as I have already proved in my
