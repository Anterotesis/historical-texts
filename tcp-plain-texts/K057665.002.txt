 HISTORICAL LAWTRACTS  VOLUME II  EDINBURGH Printed for A MILLAR at BUCHANAN's Head in the STRAND LONDON and A KINCAID and J BELL EDINBURGH MDCCLVIII  TRACT VIII  HISTORY OF BRIEVES  JURISDICTION was originally a mighty simple affair The chieftain who led the hord or clan to war was naturally appealed to in all controversies among individuals  JURISDICTION involved not then what it doth at present  viz  a privilege to declare what is law and authority to command obedience It involved no more than what naturally follows when two persons  differ in matter of interest which is to take the opinion of a third  THUS a judge originally was merely an umpire or arbiter and litigation was in effect a submission upon which account litiscontestation is in the Roman law defined a judicial contract  THE chieftain who afterwards when several clans united for common defence got the name of King was the sole judge originally in matters of importance  CAESAR describing the Germans and their manners  "Quum bellum civitas aut illatum defendit aut infert magistratus qui ei bello praesint ut vitae necisque habeant potestatem deliguntur In pace nullus communis est magistratus sed principes regionum atque pagorum inter fous jus dicunt controversiasque minuunt  Commentaria Lib  "  Slighter controversies were determined by fellowsubjects and persons distinguished by rank or office were commonly chosen umpires  BUT differences multiplying by multiplied connections and causes becoming more intricate by the art of subtilizing the Sovereign made choice of a council to assist him in his awards and this council was denominated  The King's Court  because in it he always presided Through most of the European nations at a certain period of their history we find this court established  IN the progress of society matters of jurisdiction becoming still more complex and multiplying without end the Sovereign involved in the greater affairs of government had not leisure nor skill to decide differences among his subjects Law became a science Courts were instituted and the several branches of jurisdiction civil criminal and ecclesiastical were distributed among these courts Their powers were ascertained and the causes that could be tried by them These were likewise called the King's courts not only as being put in place of the King's court properly  so called but also as the King did not renounce the power of judging in person but only freed himself from the burden of necessary attendance  BUT the Sovereign jealous of his royal authority bestowed upon these courts no other power but that of jurisdiction in its strictest sense  viz  a power to declare what is law He reserved to himself all magisterial authority even that which is necessary for explicating the jurisdiction of a court Therefore with relation to sovereign courts citation and execution proceed in the King's name and by his special authority  AS to inferior courts all authority is given to them that is necessary for explicating their jurisdiction The trust is not great considering that an appeal lyes to the sovereign court and it is below the dignity of the crown to act in an inferior court  IN the infancy of government the danger was not perceived of trusting with the King both the judicative and executive powers of the law But it being now understood that the safety of a free government depends upon balancing its several powers it has become an established maxim That the King with whom the executive part of the law is trusted has no part of the judicative power  "It seems now agreed that our Kings having delegated their whole judicial power to the judges of their several courts they by the constant and uninterrupted usage of many ages have now gained a known and stated jurisdiction regulated by certain established rules which our Kings themselves cannot make any alteration in without an act of parliament  New abridgement of the law vol I page  "  The same no doubt is understood to be the law of Scotland though so late as Craig's time it was otherwise That author  L Dieg ยง  mentions  a case where it was declared to be law that the King might judge even in his own cause  RELIGION and law originally simple were strangers to form In process of time form took the place of substance and law as well as religion were involved in solemnities What is solemn and important produceth naturally order and form among the vulgar who are addicted to objects of sense For this reason forms in most languages are named solemnities being connected with things that are solemn But by gradual improvements in society and by refinement of taste forms come insensibly to be neglected or reduced to their just value and law as well as religion are verging towards their original simplicity Thus opposite causes produce sometimes the same effects Law and religion were originally simple because man was so They will again be simple because simplicity contributes to their perfection  AFTER courts were instituted and the cognizance of all causes at that time known was distributed among them several new grounds of action occurring it behoved to be often doubtful in what court a new action should be tried An expeditious method was invented for resolving doubts of this sort The King was the fountain of jurisdiction and to him was ascribed the prerogative of delegating to what judge he thought proper any cause of this kind that occurred This was done by a brieve from the chancery directed to some established judge ordering him to try the particular cause mentioned in the brieve The King at first was under no restraint as to the choice of the judge other than what arose from rational motives provided only the party who was to be made defendant was subjected to the jurisdiction of the judge named in the brieve This limitation was necessary because the King's brieve contained not a warrant for citing the party to appear before the judge and the judge's  warrant could not reach beyond his territory But in time reason produced custom and custom became law Matters of moment behoved to be delegated to a supreme judge and in general the rule was to avoid mixing civil and criminal jurisdiction  IN the most general sense of the word every one of the King's writs commanding or prohibiting any thing to be done is termed a brieve But brieves with respect to judicial proceedings are of two kinds One is directed to the sheriff or a messenger in place of the sheriff ordering him to cite the party to appear in the King's court to answer the complaint made against him This brieve is in the English law termed an original and corresponds to our summons including the libel The other kind is that above mentioned directed to a judge delegating to him the power of trying the particular cause set forth in the brieve  OF the first kind of brieve that for breaking the King's protection is an instance  Quon attach cap  Of the other kind the brieve of bondage the brieve of distress the brieve of mortancestry the brieve of nouvel disseisin of perambulation of terce of right c are instances  OF the last mentioned brieve the following was a peculiar species When in the King's court a question of bastardy occurred to which a civil court is not competent a brieve was directed from the chancery to the bishop to try the bastardy as a prejudicial question  Reg Maj L cap  If such a case happened in an inferior court the court probably by its own authority made the remit to the spiritual court And the same being done at present in the King's courts there is no longer any use for this brieve  THE brieve of bondage might be directed either to the justiciar or to the  sheriff  Quon attach cap  The brieve for relief of cautionry might be directed to the justiciar sheriff or provost and baillies within burgh  Idem cap  The brieves of mortancestry and of nouvel disseisin could only be directed to the justiciar  Idem cap    THE brieve of distress corresponding to the English brieve  Justicies  must be examined more deliberately because it makes a figure in our law While the practice subsisted of poinding  brevi mann  for payment of debt there was no necessity for the interposition of a judge to force payment  See Tract IV  History of securities upon land for payment of debt  When courts therefore were instituted a process for payment of debt was not known The rough practice of forcing payment by private power being prohibited an action became necessary and the King interposed by a brieve directing one or other judge to try the cause  "The brieve of distress for debts shall be determined before the  justiciar sheriff baillies of burghs as it shall please the King by his letter to command them particularly within their jurisdiction  Reg Maj L cap  "  And it may be remarked by the way that when a decree was recovered under the authority of this brieve the judge directed execution by his own authority even so far as to adjudge to the creditor for his payment the land of the debtor if the moveables were not sufficient With regard to the sheriff at least the fact is ascertained by the act p This brieve explains a maxim of the common law of England  "Quod placita de catallis debitis c quae summum  sh  attingunt vel excedunt secundum legem et consuetudinem Angliae sine brevi regis placitari non debent  New abridgment of the law vol I page  "  The indulging a jurisdiction to the extent of shillings without a brieve arose apparently from the hardship of compelling a creditor to take out a brieve for a sum so small In England  the law continues the same to this day for the sheriff without a brieve cannot judge in actions of debt beyond shillings But in Scotland an original jurisdiction was by statute bestowed upon the Lords of session to judge in actions of debt  Act p  and the sheriff and other inferior judges copying after this court have by custom and prescription acquired an original jurisdiction in actions of debt without limitation and the brieve of distress is no longer in use because no longer necessary  AFTER the same manner most of these brieves have gone into desuetude for to nothing are we more prone than to an inlargement of power A court which has often tried causes by a delegated jurisdiction loses in time sight of its warrant and ventures to try such causes by its own authority Some few instances there are of brieves still in force such as these which found the process of division of lands of  terce of lyning within burgh and of perambulation For this reason I think it wrong in the court of session to sustain a process of perambulation at the first instance which ought to be carried on before the sheriff upon the authority of a brieve from the chancery And what inclines me the rather to be of this opinion is that all the brieves of this sort preserved in use regard either the fixing of land marches or the division of land among parties having interest which never can be performed to good purpose except upon the spot  SOON after the institution of the college of justice it was made a question whether that court could judge in a competition about the property of land without being authorized by a brieve of right But they got over the difficulty upon the following consideration  "That the brieve of right was long out of use and that this being a sovereign and supreme court for civil causes its jurisdiction which in its nature  is unlimited must comprehend all civil causes from the lowest to the highest  Ult February Weems  contra  Forbes observed by Skene voce Breve de recto  "  As the King's writs issuing from chancery did pass under either the Great or the Quarter Seal such solemnity came to be extremely burdensome and behoved to be severely felt in the multiplication of law proceedings This circumstance was no doubt of influence in antiquating the brieves that conferred a delegated jurisdiction and in bringing all causes under some one original jurisdiction The other sort of brieve which is no other than the King's warrant to call the defendant into the King's court has been very long in disuse and in place of it a simpler form is chosen which is a letter from the King passing under the signet directed to the sheriff or to a messenger in place of the sheriff ordering him to cite the party to  appear in court This change probably happened without an express regulation A few singular instances which were successful discovered the conveniency and instances were multiplied till the form became universal and brieves from the chancery were altogether neglected One thing is certain that letters under the signet for citing parties to appear in the King's courts can be traced pretty far back In the chartulary of Paisley preserved in the advocates library  Page  there is a full copy of a libelled summons in English dated the d February at the instance of George abbot of Paisley against the baillies of the burgh of Renfrew with respect to certain tolls customs privileges c for summoning them to appear before the King and his council at Edinburgh or where it shall happen them to be for the time ending thus  "Given under our signet at Perth the second of December and of our reign the eight year"  And  there are extant letters under the signet  d June  containing a charge to enter heir to the superiority and infeft the vassal within twenty days and if he fail summoning him to appear before the Lords of council the seventh of July next to hear him decerned to tyne his superiority and that the vassal shall hold of the next lawful superior  "Given under our signet at Stirling the second of June and of our reign the first year"  It is to be observed at the same time that this must have been a recent innovation for so late as the year the ordinary form of citing parties to appear before the Lords of session was by a brieve issued from chancery  See act p    IT is probable that originally every sort of execution which passed upon the decrees of the King's courts was authorized by a brieve issuing from chancery for if a brieve was necessary to bring the defendant  into court it is not to be supposed that less solemnity was used in executing the decree pronounced against him and that this in particular was the case when land was apprised for payment of debt is testified by d statutes Robert I cap At what time this form was laid aside or upon what occasion we know not For so far back as we have any records we sind every sort of execution personal and real upon the decrees of the King's courts authorized by letters passing the signet  OF old a certain form of words was established for every sort of action and if a man could not bring his case under any established form he had no remedy In the Roman law these forms are termed  formulae actionum  In Britain copying from the Roman law all the King's writs or brieves these at least which concern judicial proceedings are in a set form of words which it was not lawful to alter But in the progress of law new cases occurring  without end to which no established form did correspond the Romans were forced to relax from their solemnities by indulging  actiones in factum  in which the fact was set forth without reference to any form The English follow this practice by indulging  actions upon the case  It is probable that in Scotland the warrant for citation passing under the Signet was at first conceived in a set form in imitation of the brieve to which it was substituted But if this originally was the case the practice did not long continue These forms have been very long neglected every man being at liberty to set forth his case in his own words and it belongs to the court to consider whether the libel or declaration be relevant or in other words whether the facts set forth be a just cause for granting what is requested by the pursuer  TRACT IX  HISTORY OF PROCESS in ABSENCE  IN Scotland the forms of process against absents in civil and criminal actions differ too remarkably to pass unobserved Our curiosity is excited to learn whence the difference has arisen and upon what principle it is founded and for gratifying our curiosity in this particular I can think of no means more promising than a view of some foreign laws that have been copied by us  BUT in order to understand the spirit of these laws it will be necessary to look back upon the origin of civil jurisdiction of which I have had occasion in a former tract to give a sketch  History of the Criminal Law    viz  that at first judges were considered as arbiters without any magisterial powers that their authority was derived from the consent of the litigants that litiscontestation was in reality a judicial contract and therefore that the decrees of judges had not a stronger effect than an award pronounced by an arbiter properly so called Upon this system of jurisdiction there cannot be such a thing as a process in absence for a judge whose authority depends upon consent cannot give judgment against any person who submits not to his jurisdiction But civil jurisdiction like other human inventions faint and imperfect in its commencement was improved in course of time and became a more useful system After a publick was recognized and a power in the publick to  give laws to the society and to direct its operations the consent of litigants was no longer necessary to found jurisdiction A judge is held to be a public officer having authority from the publick to settle controversies among individuals and to oblige them to submit to his decrees The defendant being bound to submit to the authority of the court cannot hurt the pursuer by refusing to appear and hence a process in absence against a person who is legally cited  IN the primitive state of Rome jurisdiction was altogether voluntary A judge had no coercive power not even that of citation The first dawn of authority we discover in old Rome with relation to judicial proceedings is a power which was given to the claimant to drag his party into court  obtorto collo  as expressed in the Roman law This was a very rude form suitable however to the ignorance and rough manners of those times This glimpse of  authority was improved by transferring the power of forcing a defendant into court from the claimant to the judge and this was a natural transition after a judge was held to be a publick officer vested with every branch of authority that is necessary to explicate his jurisdiction Litiscontestation ceased to be a judicial contract But as our notions do not immediately accommodate themselves to the fluctuation of things litiscontestation continued to be handled by lawyers as a judicial contract long after jurisdiction was authoritative and neither inferred nor required consent Litiscontestation it is true could no longer be reckoned a contract but then as any subterfuge will serve a lawyer it was defined to be a  quasi  contract which in plain language is saying that it hath nothing of a contract except the name We return to the history The power of citation assumed by the judge was at first like most innovations exercised with remarkable moderation The defendant in civil  causes behoved for the most part to be cited no fewer than four times before he was bound to put in his answer The fourth citation was peremptory and carried the following certification  "Etiam absente diversa parte cogniturum se et pronunciaturum  L de judiciis  "  What followed is distinctly explained  "Et post edictum peremptorium impetratum cum dies ejus supervenerit tunc absens citari debet et sive responderit sive non responderit agetur causa et pronunciabitur non utique secundum praesentem sed interdum vel absens si bonam causam habuit vincet  Ibid l  "  IN criminal actions the form of proceeding against absents appears not among the Romans to have been thoroughly settled Two rescripts of the Emperor Trajan are founded on to prove that no criminal ought to be condemned in absence And because a proof  ex parte  cannot afford more  than a suspicion or presumption the reason given is  "Quod satius est impunitum relinqui facinus nocentis quam innocentem damnare"  On the other hand it is urged by some writers that contumacy which is itself a crime ought not to afford protection to any delinquent and therefore that a criminal action ought to be managed like a civil action Ulpian to reconcile these two opposite opinions labours at a distinction admits as to lesser crimes that a person accused may be condemned in absence but is of opinion that of a capital crime no man ought to be condemned in absence  l de poenis  Marcian seems to be of the same opinion  l pr et ยง de requir vel absen damnan  And it is laid down that the criminals whole effects in this case were inventaried and sequestred to the effect that if within the year he did not appear to purge his contumacy the whole should be consiscated  viz  in the title now mentioned    THIS form of proceeding as to civil actions at least appears to have a good foundation both in justice and expediency If my neighbour refuse to do me justice it is the part of the judge or magistrate to compel him If my neighbour be contumacious and refuse to submit to legal authority this may subject him to punishment but cannot impair my right In criminal causes where punishment alone is in view there is more room for hesitating No individual hath an interest so substantial as to make a prosecution necessary merely upon his account and therefore writers of a mild temper satisfy themselves with punishing the person accused for his contumacy Others of more severe manners are for proceeding to a trial in every case which is not capital  THAT a difference should be established between civil and criminal actions in the form of proceeding is extremely rational I cannot however help testifying some degree  of surprise at an opinion which gives peculiar indulgence to the more atrocious crimes I should rather have expected that the horror mankind naturally have at such crimes would have disposed these writers to break through every impediment in order to reach a condign punishment leaving crimes which make a less figure to be prosecuted in the ordinary form Nature and plain sense undoubtedly suggest this difference But these matters were at Rome settled by lawyers who are led more by general principles than by plain sensations And as the form of civil actions it may be supposed was first established analogy moved them to bring pecuniary mulcts and consequently all the lesser crimes under the same form  I reckon it no slight support to the foregoing reflection that as to high treason the greatest of all crimes the Roman lawyers deserting their favourite doctrine permitted action to proceed upon this crime  not only in absence of the person accused but even after death  l ad leg Jul majest    So far back as we can trace the laws of this island by the help of ancient writings and records we find judges vested with authority to explicate their jurisdiction We find at the same time the original notion of jurisdiction so far prevalent as to make it a rule that no cause could be tried in absence which to this day continues to be the law of England This rule is unquestionably a great obstruction to the course of justice For instead of trying the cause and awarding execution when the claim is found just it has forced the English courts upon a wide circuit of pains and penalties The refusing to submit to the justice of a court invested with legal authority is a crime of the grossest nature being an act of rebellion against the state And it is justly thought that the person who refuses to submit to the laws of his country ought  not to be under the protection of these laws Therefore this contempt and contumacy in civil actions as well as criminal subjects the party to diverse forfeitures and penalties He is held to be a rebel or outlaw he hath not  personam standi in judicio  he may be killed  impune  and both his liferent and single escheat fall  Bacon's new abridg of the law Tit Outlawry    IN Scotland we did not originally try even civil causes in absence more than the English do at present The compulsion to force the defendant to appear was attachment of his moveables to the possession of which he was restored upon finding bail to sist himself in court If he remained obstinate and offered not bail the goods attached were delivered to the claimant who remained in possession till the proprietor was willing to submit to a trial This is plainly laid down in the case of the brieve of right or declarator of property where if the defendant remain contumax and neither  appear nor plead an essoinสie the land in controversy is seized and sequestred in the King's hands there to remain for fifteen days if the defendant appear within the fifteen days he recovers the possession upon finding caution to answer as law will otherwise the land is adjudged to the pursuer after which the defendant has no remedy but by a brieve of right  Reg Maj l cap  Neither appears there to be any sort of cognition in other civil causes such as actions for payment of debt for performance of contracts for moveable goods where the first step was to arrest the defendant's moveables till he found caution to answer as law will  Quon attach cap cap ยง  And in these cases as well as in the brieve of right the goods attached were no doubt delivered to the claimant to be possessed by him while his party remained contumacious  AFTER the Roman law prevailed in this part of the island the foregoing practice  wore out and with regard to civil actions gave place to a more mild and equitable method which without subjecting the defendant to any penalty is more available to the pursuer This method is to try the cause in absence of the defendant in the same manner as was done in Rome of which mention is made above The relevancy is settled proof taken and judgment given precisely as where the defendant is present The only inconvenience of this method upon its introduction was the depriving the pursuer of the defendant's testimony when he chose to refer his libel to the defendant's oath This was remedied by holding the defendant as confessed upon the libel To explain this form I must shortly premise that by the old law of this island it was reckoned a hardship too great to oblige a man to give evidence against himself and for that reason the pursuer even in a civil action was denied the benefit of the defendant's testimony In Scotland the notions of the Roman law  prevailing which in the particular now mentioned were more equitable than our old law it was made a rule that the defendant in a civil action is bound to give evidence against himself and if he refuse to give his oath he is held as confessing the fact alledged by the pursuer This practice was at hand to be transferred into a process where the defendant appears not and from this time the contumacy of the defendant who obeys not a citation in a civil cause has been attended with no penal consequence for a good reason that the pursuer hath a more effectual method for attaining his end which is to insist that the defendant be held as confest upon the libel Nor is this a stretch beyond reason for the defendant's acquiescence in the claim may justly be presumed from his refusing to appear in court  BUT this new form is defective in one particular case We hold not a party as confest unless he be cited personally What  if one to avoid a personal citation keep out of the way is there no remedy in this case why not recur to the ancient practice of attaching his effects till he find caution to answer  THE English regulation that there can be no trial in absence holds we may believe in criminal as well as in civil causes not even excepting a prosecution for high treason But as this crime will never be suffered to go unpunished a method has been invented which by a circuit supplies the defect of the common law If a party accused of treason or felony contumaciously keep out of the way the crime it is true cannot be tried but the person accused may be outlawed for contumacy and the outlawry in such cases is made the means to gain the end proposed by the prosecution For though outlawry by the common law hath no other effect as above observed than a denunciation upon a horning with us yet the horror of such offences  hath introduced a regulation beyond the common law  viz  that outlawry in the case of felony subjects the party to that very punishment which is inflicted upon a felon convict and the like in treason corruption of blood excepted There is no occasion to make any circuit with relation to other crimes For the punishment of outlawry by the common law equals the punishment of any crime treason and felony excepted  HENCE the reason why death before trial is in England a total bar to all forfeitures and penalties even for high treason The crime cannot be tried in absence and after death there can be no contempt for not appearing  LAWYERS have generally but an unhappy talent at reformation for they seldom aim at the root of the evil In the case before us a superstitious attachment to ancient forms hath led English lawyers into a  glaring absurdity To prevent the hazard of injustice there must not be such a thing as a trial in absence of the person accused Yet no difficulty is made to presume a man guilty in absence without a trial and to punish him in the same manner as if he had been fairly tried and regularly condemned This is in truth converting a privilege into a penalty and holding the absent guilty without allowing them the benefit of a trial The absurdity of this method is equally glaring in another instance It is not sufficient that the defendant appear in court it is necessary that he plead and put himself upon a trial by his country The English adhere strictly to the original notion that a process implies a judicial contract and that there can be no process unless the defendant submit to have his cause tried Upon this account it is an established rule that the person accused who stands mute or refuses to plead cannot be tried To this case a peculiar punishment is adapted distinguished by the name of  peine fort et dure  The person accused is pressed to death And there are instances upon record of persons submitting to this punishment in order to save their landestates to their heirs which by the law of England are forfeited on some cases of felony as well as on high treason But here again high treason is an exception Standing mute in this case is attended with the same forfeiture which is inflicted on a person attainted of high treason  WE follow the English law so far as that no crime can be tried in absence Some exceptions to this rule were it is true for a time indulged which shall be mentioned by and by But we at present adhere so strictly to the rule that a decree in absence obtained by the procuratorfiscal before an inferior court for a bloodwit upon full proof was reduced  "The Lords being of opinion that a decreet in absence could not proceed and that the judge could go no  further than to fine the party for contumacy and to grant warrant to apprehend him till he should find caution to appear personally  Dalrymple th July Procuratorfiscal  contra  Simpson  "  IT is certainly a defect in our law that voluntary absence should be a protection against the punishment of atrocious crimes Excepting the crime of high treason with regard to which the English regulation hath now place with us the punishment of outlawry whatever the crime be never goes farther than single and liferent escheat  As to the trial of a crime after death which by the Roman law was indulged in the case of treason there are two reasons against it The first and chief is that whether the crime be committed against the publick or against a private person resentment the spring and foundation of punishment ought to be buried with the  criminal and in fact never is indulged by any person of humanity after the criminal is no more The other is drawn from the unequal situation of the relations of the deceased who unacquainted with his private history have not the same means of justification which to himself as it may be supposed would have been an easy task Upon this account the indulging criminal prosecutions after death would open a door to most grievous oppression In a country where such is the law no man can be secure that his heirs shall inherit his fortune With respect however to treason it seems reasonable that in some singular cases it ought to be excepted from this rule If a man be slain in battle fighting obstinately against an established government there is no inhumanity in forfeiting his estate after his death nor can such a privilege in the crown confined to the case now mentioned be made an engine of oppression considering the notoriety of the fact And indeed it carries no slight air of absurdity  that the most daring acts of rebellion  viz  rising in arms against a lawful sovereign and opposing him in battle should if death ensue be out of the reach of law for dying in battle honourably in the man's own opinion and in that of his associates can in no light be reckoned a punishment This in reality is a very great encouragement to persevere in rebellion A man who takes arms against his country where such is the law can have no true courage if he lay them down till he either conquer or die This may be thought a reasonable apology for the Roman law which countenanced a trial of treason after death confined expresly to the case now mentioned  "Is qui in reatu decedit integri status decedit Extinguitur enim crimen mortalitate nisi forte quis majestatis reus fuit nam hoc crimine nisi a successoribus purgetur hereditas fisco vindicatur Plane non quisquis legis Juliae majestatis reus est in eadem conditione est sed qui perduellionis reus est hostili animo  adversus rempublicam vel principem animatus caeterum si quis ex alia causa legis Juliae majestatis reus sit morte crimine liberatur  l ult ad leg Jul majest  "  THE Roman law was copied indiscreetly indeed by our legislature authorizing without any limitation a process for treason after the death of the person suspected  Act p  But the legislature reflecting upon the danger of trusting with the crown a privilege so extraordinary did by an act in the year which was never printed restrain this privilege within proper bounds The words are  "And because the saids Lords think the said act  viz  the act too general and prejudicial to all the Barons of this realm therefore statutes and ordains that the said act shall have no place in time coming but against the airs of them that notourly committs or shall commit crimes of lese majesty against the King's person against the  realm for everting the same and against them that shall happen to betray the King's army allenarly it being notourly known in their time and the airs of these persons to be called and pursued within five years after the decease of the said persons committers of the saids crimes and the said time being bypast the saids airs never to be pursued for the same  IN the year Robert Logan of Restalrig was after his death accused in parliament as accessory to the Earl of Gowrie's conspiracy and his estate was forfeited to the crown though in appearance at least he had died a loyal subject and in fact never had committed any ouvert act of treason Strange that this statute was never once mentioned during the trial as sufficient to bar the prosecution Whether to attribute this to the undue influence of the crown or to the gross ignorance and stupidity of our men of law at that period I am at a loss Of one thing I am certain that there is not to be found upon record another instance of such flagrant injustice in judicial proceedings  "  A process of treason against an absent person regularly cited rests upon a different footing It is some presumption of guilt that a man accused of a crime obstinately refuses to submit himself to the law of his  country and yet the dread of injustice or of false witnesses may with an innocent person be a motive to keep out of the way This uncertainty about the motive of the person accused ought to confine to the highest court every trial in absence that of treason especially where the person accused is not upon an equal footing with his prosecutors And probably this would have been the practice in Scotland but for one reason The sessions of our parliament of old were generally too short for a regular trial in a criminal cause Upon this account the trial of treason after death was from necessity rather than choice permitted to the court of justiciary And this court which enjoyed the greater privilege could entertain no doubt of the less  viz  that of trying treason in absence This latter power however being called in question the legislature thought proper to countenance it by an express statute not indeed as to every species of treason in general but only in the case of  "treasonable rising in arms and open  and manifest rebellion against his majesty  Act p  "  FROM this deduction it will be manifest that the act p rescinding certain forfeitures in absence pronounced by the court of justiciary before the said statute proceeds upon a mistake in fact in subsuming  "That before the year there was no law impowering the Lords of justiciary to forfeit in absence for perduellion"  And yet this mistake is made an argument not indeed for depriving the court of justiciary of this power in time coming but for annulling all sentences for treason pronounced in absence by this court before the These sentences it is true proceeding from undue influence of ministerial power deserved little countenance But if they were iniquitous it had been suitable to the dignity of the legislature to annul them for that cause instead of assigning a reason that cannot  bear a scrutiny However this be I cannot avoid observing that the jurisdiction of the court of justiciary to try in absence open and manifest rebellion was far from being irrational And it is remarkable that this was the opinion of our legislature even after the revolution for though they were willing to lay hold of any pretext to annul a number of unjust forfeitures they did not however find it convenient to abrogate the statute but left it in full force Comparing our law in this particular with that of England it appears to me clear that the form authorized by the said statute which gives access to a fair trial ought to be preferred before the English form which annexes the highest penalties to an outlawry for treason without any trial  IT remains only to be observed that the English treason laws being since the union made a part of our criminal law the foregoing regulations for trying the crime of treason in absence of the party accused or  after his death are at an end and at present that the rule holds universally that no crime can be tried in absence In England no crime was ever tried in absence far less after death The parliament itself did not assume this power for an attainder for high treason in absence of the delinquent proceeds not upon trial of the cause but is of the nature of an outlawry for contumacious absence Nor is this form varied by the union of the two kingdoms for the British parliament as to all matters of law is governed by the forms established in the English parliament before the union At the same time the humanity of our present manners affords great security that the treason laws will never be so far extended in Britain as they have been in Scotland to forfeit an heir for the crime of his ancestor I am not of opinion that such a forfeiture is repugnant to the common rules of justice when it is confined to the case above mentioned and yet it is undoubtedly more beneficial for the inhabitants of this island  that by the mildness of our laws some criminals may escape than that an extraordinary power which in perilous times may be stretched against the innocent should be lodged even in the safest hands The national genius so far from favouring rigorous punishments or any latitude in criminal prosecutions has the direct opposite tendency There cannot be a stronger evidence of this benign disposition than the late acts of parliament discharging all forfeiture of lands or hereditaments even for high treason after the death of the Pretender and his two sons  th Ann and th Geo II    TRACT X  HISTORY OF EXECUTION against MOVEABLES and LAND for payment of debt  AGAINST a debtor refractory or negligent the proper legal remedy is to lay hold of his effects for paying his creditors This is the method prescribed by the Roman law  l ยง de re judic  with the following addition that the moveables as of less importance than the land should be first sold But the Roman law is defective  in one respect that the creditor was disappointed if no buyer was found The defect was supplied by a rescript of the Emperor  l ยง de re judic  appointing that failing a purchaser the goods shall be adjudged to the creditor by a reasonable extent  AMONG other remarkable innovations of the feudal law one is that land was withdrawn from commerce and could not be attached for payment of debt Neither could the vassal be attached personally because he was bound personally to the superior for service The moveables therefore which were always the chief subject of execution came now to be the only subject In England attachment of moveables for payment of debt is warranted by the King's letter directed to the Sheriff commonly called a  Fieri Facias  and this practice is derived from common law without a statute The sheriff is commanded  "to sell as many of the debtor's  moveables as will satisfy the debt and to return the money with the writ into the court at Westminster"  The method is the same at this day without any remedy in the case where a purchaser is not found  LAND when left free to commerce by dissolution of the feudal fetters was of course subjected to execution for payment of debt This was early introduced with relation to the King For from the  Magna Charta  Cap th  it appears to have been the King's privilege failing goods and chattels to take possession of the land till the debt was paid And from the same chapter it appears that the like privilege is bestowed upon a cautioner in order to draw payment of what sums he is obliged to advance for the principal debtor By the statute of merchants  th Edward I  the same privilege is given to merchants and by th Edward I cap the privilege is communicated to creditors in general but with the following  remarkable limitation that they are allowed to possess the half only of the land By this time it was settled that the military vassal's power of aliening reached the half only of his freehold  See abridgement of statute law Tit  Recognition  And it was thought incongruous to take from the debtor by force of execution what he himself could not dispose of even for the most rational consideration The last mentioned statute enacts  "That where debt is recovered or knowledged in the King's court or damages awarded it shall be in the election of him that sueth to have a  fieri facias  unto the sheriff to levy the debt upon the lands and chattels of the debtor or that the sheriff shall deliver to him all the chattels of the debtor saving his oxen and beasts of his plough and the one half of his land until the debt be levied upon a reasonable extent and if he be put out of the land he shall recover it again by writ of nouvel disseisin and after that by writ of redisseisin if need be"  The writ authorized by this statute which from the election given to the creditor got the name of  Elegit  is the only writ in the law of England that in any degree corresponds to our apprising or adjudication The operations however of these two writs are far from being the same The property of the land apprised or adjudged is transferred to the creditor in satisfaction of his claim if the debtor forbear to make payment for ten years but an  elegit  hath no other effect but to put the creditor in possession till the debt be paid by levying the rents and profits This is an inconvenient method of drawing payment  FOR besides the inconvenience of getting payment by parcels it is not easy for the creditor in compting for the rents to avoid a lawsuit which in this case must always be troublesome and expensive It may also happen that the rent does no more but satisfy the interest of the money must the creditor in this case be satisfied with the possession without ever hoping to acquire the property The common law assuredly affords him no remedy But it is probable that upon application by the creditor the court of chancery upon a principle of equity will direct the land to be sold for payment of the debt  but at the time of the statute it was probably thought  a stretch to subject land at any rate to a creditor for his payment And the English tenacious of their customs never think of making improvements or even of supplying legal defects of which this statute affords another instance still greater than that now mentioned In England at present land generally speaking is absolutely under the power of the proprietor and yet the ancient practice still subsists confining execution to the half precisely as in early times when the debtor could dispose of no more but the half Means however are contrived indirect indeed to supply this palpable defect Any other creditor is authorized to seize the half of the land left out of the first execution and so on without end Thus by strictly adhering to form without regarding substance law instead of a rational science becomes a heap of subterfuges and incongruities which tend insensibly to corrupt the morals of those who make law their profession  AND here to prevent mistakes it must be observed that the clause in the statute bearing  "That the sheriff by a  fieri facias  may levy the debt upon the land and chattels of the debtor"  authorises not the sheriff to deliver the land to the creditor but only to sell what is found upon the land such as corn or cattle and to levy the rents which at the time of the execution are due by the tenants  LETTERS of poinding in Scotland correspond to the writ of  Fieri Facias  in England but the defect above mentioned in the  fieri facias  is supplied in our execution against moveables according to its ancient form which is copied from the Roman law The execution was in the following manner  "The goods upon the debtor's land whether belonging to the master or tenant are carried to the market cross of the head burgh of the sheriffdom and there sold for payment of the debt But if a purchaser be not found goods are apprized  to the value of the debt and delivered to the creditor for his payment  Quon attach cap  "  And here it must be remarked that bating the rigour of selling the tenant's goods for the landlord's debt this method is greatly preferable to that presently in use which enjoins not a sale of the goods but only that they be delivered to the creditor at apprized values This is unjust because in place of money which the creditor is entitled to claim goods are imposed on him to which he has no claim But this act of injustice to the creditor is a triffle compared with the wrong done to the debtor by another branch of the execution that has crept into practice In letters of poinding a blank being left for the name of the messenger the creditor is impowered to chuse what messenger he pleases and of consequence to chuse also the appretiators by which means he is in effect both judge and party In a practice so irregular what can be expected but an unfair  appretiation always below the value of the goods poinded And for grasping at this undue advantage the creditor's pretext is but too plausible  viz  that contrary to the nature of his claim he is forced as I have said to accept goods in lieu of money Thus our execution against moveables in its present form is irregular and unjust in all views Wonderful that contrary to the tendency of all publick regulations towards perfection this should have gradually declined from good to bad and from bad to worse And we shall have additional cause to wonder when in the course of this enquiry it appears that the indulging to the creditor the choice of the messenger and appretiators has with respect to execution against land produced effects still more pernicious than that under consideration  POINDING is put upon a better footing by act of sederunt th August    OUR Kings it is probable borrowed from England the privilege of entering upon  the debtor's land for payment of debt That they had this privilege appears from d statutes Robert I cap which is copied almost word for word from the th chapter of the  Magna Charta  Cautioners had the same privilege  Ibid cap  which was extended as in England to merchants  Ibid cap  This execution did not entitle the creditor to have the land sold for payment of the debt but only to take possession of the land and to maintain his possession till the debt was paid precisely as in England But as it has been the genius of our law in all ages to favour creditors a form of execution against land for payment of debt more effectual than that now mentioned or to this day is known in England was early introduced into this part of the island which is to sell land for payment of the debt in the same manner that moveables were sold The brieve of distress failing moveables is extended to the debtor's land which is appointed to be sold by the sheriff for payment  of the debt  Stat Alex II cap  Nor was this execution restricted to the half as in England for our forefathers were more regardful of the creditor than of the superior And though this originally might be a stretch it happens luckily to be perfectly well accommodated to the present condition of landproperty which for the most part is not more limited than the property of moveables  BUT here a defect will be observed in Alexander's statute that no provision is made in case a purchaser be not found the less excusable that the legislature had before their eyes a perfect model in the form prescribed for the attachment of moveables  THERE are words in this statute to occasion a doubt whether attachment of land for payment of debt was not an earlier practice in our law The words are  "The debtor not selling his lands within fifteen days the sheriff and the King's servants  shall sell the lands and possessions pertaining to the debtor  conform to the consuetude of the realm  until the creditor be satisfied of the principal sum with damage expence and interest"  But these words  Conform to the consuetude of the realm  seem to refer to the form of selling moveables For I see not what other regulation was introduced by the statute if it was not selling of land for payment of debt And considering the circumstances of these times when the feudal law was still in vigour and the commerce of land but in its infancy we cannot rationally assign an earlier date to this practice  IN England the statute of merchants was necessary to creditors who at that period had not access to the land of their debtors But as in Scotland every creditor had access to the land of his debtor it will be expected that some account should be given why the statute of merchants was introduced here What occurs is that the chief  view of the Scotch statute was to give access to the debtor's person which formerly could not be attached for payment of debt And when such a novelty was introduced as that of giving execution against the person of the debtor against his moveables and against his land all at the same time it was probably thought sufficient to give security upon the land for payment of the debt without proceeding to a sale  IT appears from our records that sometimes land was sold for payment of debt upon the above mentioned statute of Alexander II and sometimes that security only was granted upon the land by authority of the statute of merchants Of the latter one instance occurs upon record in a seisin dated th January and many such instances are upon record down to the time that general apprisings crept into practice  IT is said above that the statute of Alexander II is defective in not providing  a remedy where a purchaser is not found But this defect was supplied by our judges and land failing a purchaser was adjudged to the creditor by a reasonable extent which without a statute was done by analogy of the execution against moveables Of this there is one precise instance in a charter dated d July a copy of which is annexed  N  o  th  And thus we find that what is properly called a decreet of apprising was introduced into practice before the statute though that statute is by all our authors assigned as the origin of apprisings But it appears from the statute itself compared with former practice that nothing else was in view but to limit the effect of the brieve of distress with respect to tenants that there should not be execution against their goods for the landlord's debt farther than to the extent of a term's rent And because it was reckoned a hardship on a debtor considered as landlord to have his land taken from him neglecting  the moveable goods upon the land therefore a sweetning privilege is bestowed on him of redeeming the land within seven years But this regulation was attended with an unhappy consequence probably not foreseen It rendered ineffectual the most useful branch of the execution  viz  the selling land for payment of the debt For no person will chuse to purchase land under reversion while there is any prospect of coming at land without an embargo This statute therefore instead of giving a beginning to apprisings of land did in reality reduce them to a form less perfect than they had originally  ONE salutary regulation was introduced by this statute By the former practice no bounds being set to the time of compleating the execution it was left to the discretion of the sheriff to delay as long as he pleased for a purchaser To supply this defect it was enacted  "That if a purchaser be not found in six months the sheriff must proceed  to apprise land and to adjudge it to the creditor"  IN no particular are the different manners of the two nations more conspicuous than in their laws The English tenacious of their customs have from the beginning preserved their forms entire with little or no variation The Scotch delighting in change have been always attempting or indulging innovations By this propensity many articles of our law are brought to a reasonable degree of perfection But by the same propensity we are too apt to indulge relaxation of discipline which has bred a profusion of slovenly practice in lawmatters The following history will justify the latter part of this reflection  DURING a vacancy in the office of sheriff or even when the sheriff was otherwise employed it appears to have been early the practice of the King's courts to name a substitute for executing any particular  affair and this substitute was called  The sheriff in that part  Within thirty years of the statute there are examples of letters of apprising directed to messengers at arms as  sheriffs in that part  These letters we may believe were at first not permitted without a sufficient cause but slighter and slighter causes being sustained heretable sheriffs took the alarm and obtained an act of parliament  Act p    "discharging commissions to be given in time coming for serving of brieves or apprising of lands but to the judge ordinary unless  causa cognita  upon calling the judge ordinary to object against the cause of granting"  But this statute did not put an end to the abuse The practice was revived of naming messengers at arms as sheriffs in that part for executing letters of apprising till at the long run it became an established custom to direct all letters of apprising to these officers  APPRISING of land being an execution by the sheriff behoved of consequence to be within the county But the substitution as aforesaid of messengers who are not connected with any particular county paved the way to the infringement of a regulation necessarily derived from the very nature of the execution The first instance on record of permitting the court of apprising to be held at Edinburgh is in the year The reason given for a step so irregular was that the debtor's lands lay in two shires And as Edinburgh by this time was become the capital of the kingdom where the King's courts most commonly were held and where every landed gentleman was supposed to have a procurator to answer for him it was reckoned no wide stretch to hold courts of apprising at Edinburgh for the whole kingdom From this period downward instances of holding courts of apprising at Edinburgh multiply upon us and this came to be considered as a matter of right without necessity of  assigning any cause for demanding a dispensation or at least without necessity of verifying the cause assigned  THIS substitution of a messenger in place of the sheriff produced another effect not less irregular than that now mentioned and much more pernicious to debtors In letters of poinding as observed above a blank is left for the name of the messenger the same is the form of letters of apprising and by this means in both executions equal+ly the creditor has the choice of the messenger and consequently of the appretiators Thus by obtaining the court of apprising to be held at Edinburgh by a judge chosen at will the creditor acquired the absolute direction of the execution against land and precisely as in the execution against moveables became in effect both judge and party It will not be surprising that the grossest legal iniquity was the result of such slovenly practice Creditors taking the advantage of the indulgence given them exerted their  power with so little reserve as to grasp at the debtor's whole landestate without the least regard to the extent of the debt In short without using so much as the formality of an appretiation it became customary to adjudge to the creditor every subject belonging to the debtor that could be carried by this execution for which the expence of bringing witnesses to Edinburgh from distant shires to value land and the difficulty of determining the value of real burdens affecting land were at first the pretext  As there is no record of apprisings before the year we are not certain of the precise periods of these several innovations The only knowledge we have of apprisings before that time is from the King's charters passing upon apprisings which is a very lame record considering how many apprisings must have been led that were not compleated by charter and seisin But imperfect as this record may be we find several charters in the  c passing upon these general apprisings  IT cannot but appear strange that such gross relaxation of essential forms and such robbery under colour of law were not checked in the bud by the sovereign court Yet we find nothing of this kind attempted though the remedy was at hand There was no occasion for any new regulation It would have been sufficient to restore the brieve of distress to its original principles All excesses however promote naturally their own cure which is the most remarkable in avarice when exorbitant These general apprisings by their frequency became a publick nusance past all enduring The matter was brought under consideration of parliament and a statute was made by far too mild For instead of cutting down general apprisings root and branch as illegal and oppressive the exorbitant profits were only pruned off and it was enacted  Act p    "That  the rents intromitted with by the creditor if more than sufficient to pay his annualrent shall be applied towards extinction of the principal sum"  IT must not escape observation that by this new regulation an apprising is in effect moulded into quite a new form much less perfect than it was originally for from being a judicial sale it is reduced to the nature of a judicial security or a  pignus praetorium  approaching much nearer than formerly to the English  elegit  AN attempt was made by act p to restore special adjudications but unsuccessfully It might have been forseen without much penetration that no debtor will voluntarily give off land sufficient to pay the debt claimed and a fifth part more reserving a power of redemption for five years only when his refusal subjects him to no harder alternative than to have his whole lands impledged for security of the neat sum  due with a power of redemption for ten years It had been an attempt more worthy of the legislature to restore the brieve of distress by appointing land to be sold upon application of any single creditor for payment of his debt But nothing of this kind was thought of till the year when a statute was made authorising a sale of the debtor's whole estate in case of insolvency This regulation which was brought to greater perfection by later statutes is after all an imperfect remedy because it only takes place where the debtor is bankrupt And hence it is that by the present law of Scotland there is no effectual means for obtaining payment out of the debtor's landestate unless he be insolvent Being familiarized with this regulation it doth not disgust us but it probably will surprise a stranger to find a country where the debtor's insolvency affords the only effectual means his creditors have to obtain payment by force of law  UPON the whole it is a curious morsel of history that lies before us In the first stages of our law we had a form of execution for drawing payment of debt perfect in its kind or so nigh perfection as scarce to be susceptible of any improvement It has been the operation of ages to alter change innovate and relax from this form till it became grievous and intollerable New moulded by various regulations it makes at present a better figure But with all the improvements of later times the best that can be said of it is that though far distant it approacheth nearer to its original perfection than at any time for a century or two past And for the publick good nothing remains for the legislature but to review the brieve of distress in its original state with respect to moveables as well as land admitting only some alterations that are made necessary by change of circumstances such as the present independency of tenants and their privilege to hold property distinct from their landlords  TRACT XI  HISTORY OF PERSONAL EXECUTION for payment of debt  THE subjects that ly open to execution for payment of debt are st The debtor's moveables dly His land And dly His person The two former being discussed in the tract immediately foregoing we proceed to the history of the latter Personal execution for payment of debt was introduced after execution against land and long after execution against moveables Nor will this appear singular when  we consider that the debtor's person cannot like his land or moveables be converted into money for payment of debt And with regard to a vassal in particular his person cannot regularly be withdrawn from the service he owes his superior This would not have been tolerated while the feudal law was in vigour and came to be indulged in the decline of that law when land was improved and personal services were less valued than pecuniary casualties  AMONG the ancient Egyptians payment was taken out of the debtor's goods but the body of the debtor could not be attached An individual upon account of a private debt could not be withdrawn from the service he owed to the publick whether in peace or war Our author Diodorus Siculus  Book Ch  mentions that Solon established this law in Athens freeing all the citizens from imprisonment for debt And he adds that some did justly blame many of the Grecian lawmakers who forbade arms ploughs and other things necessary for labour to be taken as pledges and yet permitted the persons who used these instruments to be imprisoned  The first statute in this island introducing personal execution is IIth Edward I which as appears from the preamble was to secure merchants and encourage trade It is directed against the inhabitants of royal burrows  and  "subjects in the first place their moveables and burgage lands to be sold for payment of the debt due to the merchant And failing goods the body of the debtor is to be taken and kept in prison till he agree with his creditor And if he have not wherewith to sustain himself in prison the creditor shall find him in bread and water"  An additional security is introduced by th Edward I  "If the debtor do not pay the debt at the day the magistrates upon application of the creditors are obliged to commit him to the townprison there to remain upon his own expence until payment If the debtor be not found within the town a writ is directed to the sheriff of the shire where he is to imprison him After a quarter of a year from the time of his imprisonment his goods and lands shall be delivered to the merchant by a reasonable extent to hold them till the debt is levied and his body shall remain in prison and the merchant  shall find him bread and water"  This latter statute was adopted by us  d stat Rob I cap  and our statute I presume is the foundation of the act of warding peculiar to royal burrows for this execution is precisely in terms of the statute  As this was found a successful expedient for obtaining payment of debt it was thereafter extended to all creditors  th Edward III cap  And thus in England the creditor may if he pleases begin with attaching the person of his debtor by a writ named  Capias ad satisfaciendum  the same with an act of warding in Scotland against inhabitants of royal burrows But as this act of Edward III was not adopted by our legislature there is to this day with us no authority for a  capias ad satisfaciendum  except in the single case above mentioned of an act of warding  IT is a celebrated question in the Roman law touching obligations  ad facta praestanda  whether the debtor be bound specifically to perform or whether he be liable  pro interesse  only It is at least the more plausible opinion that a man is bound according to his engagement and after all why indulge to the debtor an option to pay a sum in place of performing that work to which he bound himself without an option The person accordingly who becomes bound  ad factum praestandum  is not with us indulged in an alternative If he refuse when he is able to perform it is understood an act of contumacy and disobedience to the law This is a solid foundation for the letters of four forms which formerly were issued upon obligations  ad facta praestanda  And this execution was at the same time abundantly moderate for it is worthy to be remarked that there is not in these letters a single injunction but what is in the obligor's power to perform The ultimate injunction is  "To perform his obligation or to surrender his person to ward under the penalty that otherwise  he shall be denounced rebel"  If the obligor surrendered his person to prison the will of the letters was fulfilled and no further execution did proceed If he was contumacious by refusing both alternatives his disobedience to the law was justly held an act of rebellion to subject him to be denounced or declared rebel  See in the Appendix N  o  a copy of letters of four forms  And perhaps this execution was rather too mild for the man who refuseth to perform his engagement when it is in his power may in great justice be declared a rebel without admitting any alternative such as delivering his person to ward  OBLIGATIONS for payment of money were viewed in a different light If a man failed to pay his debt the failure was presumed to proceed from inability not obstinacy Therefore unless some criminal circumstance was qualified the debtor was not subjected to any sort of punishment  His land and moveables lay open to be attached by poinding apprising and arrestment and these were in this case the only remedies provided to the creditor The English have adopted very different maxims Imprisonment upon failure of payment whether considered as a punishment or a compulsion must proceed upon the supposition of contumacy and unwillingness to pay For upon the supposition of inability without any fault on the debtor's part it is not only repugnant to the plainest principles of law to punish him with loss of liberty but an absurd regulation tending to no good end Therefore the  capias ad satisfaciendum  in England must be founded upon the presumption of unwillingness to pay This appeared to us a harsh presumption as it is frequently wide of the real fact and therefore we forbore to adopt the English statute But experience taught our legislature that failure in making payment proceeds from obstinacy or idleness as often as from inability nay in many  instances debtors were found secreting their effects in order to disappoint their creditors and there was encouragement to deal in such fraudulent practices when debtors were in all events secure against personal execution These considerations produced the act of sederunt It is set forth in the preamble  "That the defect of personal execution upon liquid grounds of debt was heavily complained of because after great charge and tedious delay in obtaining decreet the creditors were often disappointed of their payment by simulate and fraudulent alienations made by the debtors of their lands and goods whereby execution upon such decreets was altogether frustrated"  therefore appointed  "That letters of horning as well as of poinding shall be directed upon decreets for liquid sums in the same manner as formerly given upon decreets  ad facta praestanda  "  And this act of sederunt is ratified by the act p  THERE is not in the law of any country a stronger instance of harshness I may say of brutality than occurs in our present form of personal execution for payment of debt where the debtor without ceremony is declared a rebel merely upon failure of payment To punish a man as a rebel who by misfortunes or be it bad oeconomy is rendered insolvent betokens the most savage and barbarous manners One would imagine love of riches to be the ruling passion in a country where poverty is the object of so great punishment It is true the cruelty of this execution is softened by practice as it could not possibly stand its ground against every principle of humanity It is a subject however of curiosity to enquire how this rigorous execution crept in The act just now mentioned gives no countenance to it for the letters of four forms to be issued by that statute upon decrees for payment of debt are by no means so rigorous as our hornings are at present These letters as  above explained impose no other hardship upon the debtor than to oblige him to surrender his person in ward if he doth not pay This indeed is a stretch but a moderate one which the uncertainty whether failure of payment proceeds from unwillingness or inability may justify But upon such an uncertainty to declare a debtor rebel unless he pays is a brutal practice which can admit of no excuse If indeed the debtor who does not pay refuse to put himself in prison this is a contempt of authority for which he may be justly declared rebel The question then is what it was that produced an alteration so rigorous in the form of this execution that a debtor in place of being denounced rebel upon failing to go to prison is denounced rebel upon failing to make payment when it is often not in his power to make payment  IN handling this curious subject we must be satisfied to grope our way in the dark paths of antiquity almost without a guide  And when we travel this road the first thing we discover is that letters of four forms were not the only warrant for personal execution upon  facta praestanda  By the act p touching the designation of a manse and glebe to the minister letters of horning are ordered to be directed by the privy council to charge the possessor to remove within ten days under the pain of rebellion without any alternative such as that of surrendering his person in ward And indeed this alternative would be absurd where a fact is commanded to be done that cannot conveniently admit of delay Obligations  ad facta praestanda  arising  ex delicto  were I presume attended with the like summary execution And I have seen one instance of this  viz  letters of horning  anno  against a person who had been guilty of a spuilสie commanding that he should be charged to redeliver the spuilสied goods within eight days under the penalty or certification of being denounced rebel Thus though no  execution was awarded upon civil contracts  ad facta praestanda  other than letters of four forms yet I presume that upon such obligations arising  ex delicto  horning properly so called upon one charge  LETTERS of horning mean a letter from the King ordering or commanding the debtor to make payment under the pain of being proclaimed a rebel The service of this letter upon the debtor is named a Charge of Horning If the debtor disobey the charge he is denounced or proclaimed a rebel and because of old a horn served the same purpose in proclamations that trumpets do at present therefore the said letter has by custom though improperly obtained the name of Letters of Horning and the service of the letter has obtained the name of a Charge of Horning  was commonly the execution And as to obligations introduced by statute the manner of execution is generally directed in the statute itself  I have made another discovery that the alternative of surrendering the person in ward was not always the stile of letters of four forms On the contrary when letters of four forms proceeded upon a delict as they sometimes did I conjecture that the foregoing alternative was left out My  authority is the act p  "ordering letters to be direct by the Lords of council in all the four forms charging excommunicated persons to satisfy the kirk under the pain of rebellion"  with out any such alternative as surrendering the person in ward  THOUGH horning be a generic term comprehending letters of four forms as well as horning properly so called as is clear from the above mentioned statute appointing a decree for a liquid sum to be made effectual by letters of four forms which there pass under the general name of horning yet generally speaking when horning is mentioned in our old statutes it is understood to be horning upon one charge in opposition to letters of four forms And it is a rule without exception that wherever horning is ordained to proceed upon a single charge the alternative of surrendering the person in ward is understood to be excluded For where the common number of charges is  remitted in order to force a speedy performance it would be absurd to put it in the power of the person charged to evade performance by going to prison  THE operations of our law were originally slow and tedious There behoved to be four citations before a man could be effectually brought into court and there behoved to be four charges before a man could be effectually brought to give obedience to a decree pronounced against him The inconveniency was not much felt in the days of idleness but when industry prevailed and the value of labour was understood the multiplicity of these legal steps became intolerable The number of citations were reduced to two authorized by the same warrant and at last a single citation was made sufficient It is probable that the charges necessary to be given upon decrees did originally proceed upon four distinct letters or warrants which being found unnecessary and that one letter or  warrant might be a sufficient authority for the four charges the form was changed according to the model of the letters of four forms latest in use At the same time where dispatch was required as upon obligations  ad facta praestanda  arising  ex delicto  and upon statutory obligations one charge instead of four was made sufficient But these different forms of execution were confined to obligations  ad facta praestanda  And with relation to all of them not excepting the most rigorous it must be remarked that they did not exceed rational bounds The obligor was in no case declared a rebel unless where he was guilty of a real contempt of legal authority by refusing to do some act which he had power to perform  WE next proceed to unfold the origin of personal execution upon bonded debts which probably will give light to the present enquiry There is no ground to suppose that personal execution was known in  this island before the reign of Edward I In England it was introduced by two statutes which were adopted by us This has already been mentioned as also that in England by a statute of Edward III every person who is debtor in a sum of money is subjected to personal execution which was not adopted by us Now though our law gave no authority for personal execution except against inhabitants of royal burrows yet a hint was taken to make this execution more general by consent While money was a scarce commodity and while the demand for it was greater than could be readily supplied monied men taking advantage of that circumstance introduced a practice of imposing upon borrowers hard conditions which were ingrossed in the instrument of debt One of these was that in case of failing to make payment personal as well as real execution should issue And letters of four forms were accordingly issued though it may be a doubt whether in strict law a  private paction be a sufficient foundation for such execution which being of the nature of a punishment cannot justly be inflicted where there is no crime But by this time we had begun to relish the English notion that the failing to make payment proceeds generally from unwillingness and not from inability and upon that supposition the execution was materially just though scarce well founded on law This practice however gained ground without attention to strict principles and it came to be established that consent is a sufficient foundation for personal execution  BUT the rigour of moneylenders did not stop here They were not satisfied with letters of four forms because the dreadful commination of being declared rebel might in all events be evaded by the debtor's surrendering his person in ward Nothing less would suffice than to have the most rigorous execution at command such as was in practice upon an obligation  ad factum  praestandum  arising  ex delicto  And thus in bonds for borrowed money it became customary to provide that instead of letters of four forms letters of horning should proceed upon a single charge commanding the debtor to make payment under the penalty of being declared a rebel without admitting the alternative of going to prison At the same time the debtor commonly was charged to make payment within so few days as not even to have sufficient time for the performance however willing or ready he might be The rigour of these pactions was in part repressed by the act p particularly with respect to the time of performance but personal execution upon obligations for debt was left untouched as was also the form of this execution upon a single charge attended with the penalty of rebellion upon failing to make payment  IN this manner crept in personal execution upon bonded debts which in practice  was so thoroughly established as to be issued without ceremony upon consenting in general  "that executorials might proceed in form as effeirs"  One instance of this appears in the record  viz  letters of four forms John Lawson  contra  Sir John Stewart and his son dated the th May and recorded th August thereafter But probably letters of horning properly so called upon a single charge were never issued unless in pursuance of an explicite consent  IT may justly be presumed that the practice of personal execution upon bonded debts paved the way to the above mentioned act of sederunt For after personal execution upon decrees of consent for payment of money was once established it was a natural extension to give the same execution upon decrees for payment of money obtained  in foro contentioso  IT only remains to be observed with respect to personal execution upon decrees  in  foro contentioso  that it has always been understood an extraordinary remedy and therefore that it requires the special interposition of the sovereign authority This authority is obtained by an order directed to the keeper of the King's signet issuing from any of his proper courts such as the session justiciary or privy council when it was in being for the King interposes his authority of course for executing the ordinances of his own courts But as he condescends not to execute the ordinances of any other court therefore no inferior judge or magistrate can give warrant for letters of horning not even the judge of the court of admiralty nor the commissaries of Edinburgh neither of which properly are the King's courts The method formerly in use for procuring personal execution upon the decrees of such courts was to obtain from the court of session a decree of interposition commonly called a  Decreet conform  which being a decree of a sovereign court was a proper foundation for letters of horning But this  method gave place to one more expeditious as we shall see anon  IF this sketch of the origin of personal execution with respect to debt be but roughly drawn let the deficiency of materials plead my excuse Luckily there is not the same ground of complaint in the following part of the history every article of which is clearly vouched The first statute abridging letters of four forms upon decrees  in foro contentioso  is the act p  "authorising letters of horning containing a single charge of ten days to proceed upon decreets of magistrates withinburgh without the necessity of letters conform"  Letters of horning properly so called upon a single charge being here introduced in place of letters of four forms the known tenor of such letters removed all ambiguity and made it evident that the legislature intended the debtor should be denounced rebel upon failing to make payment without admitting the alternative of surrendering  his person in ward Here is a monster of a statute repugnant to humanity and common justice But by this time the alternative of being denounced rebel upon failing to make payment founded on consent was familiar and if such execution could be founded on consent it was reckoned as would appear no wide stretch to give the same execution upon a decree  in foro contentioso  This however is no sufficient apology for extending a harsh practice which ought rather to have been totally abolished But the influence of custom is great and our legislature submitted to its authority without due deliberation not only in this statute but in others which past afterwards of course extending this regulation to the decrees of other inferior courts  Act p Act p Act p Act p  It may justly be a matter of surprise how it is possible that statutes so contradictory to every principle of equity and humanity could make their  way and be tamely submitted to To account for this I must observe that the same thing happened here that constantly happens with relation to harsh and rigorous laws Such laws have a natural tendency to dissolution and even where they are supported by the authority of a settled government means are never wanting in practice to blunt their edge Thus though the law was submitted to which annexed the penalties of rebellion to the guilt of presumed disobedience when possibly at bottom there was no fault yet no judge could be so devoid of common humanity as willingly to give scope to such penalties A distinction was soon recognized betwixt treason or rebellion in the proper sense of the word and the constructive rebellion under consideration termed civil rebellion and it came to be reckoned oppressive and disgraceful to lay hold of any of the penalties attending the latter In this manner civil rebellion lost its sting first in practice and now with regard to single and  liferent escheat by a British statute  th Geo II  For though the law was scarce ever put in execution to make these penalties effectual yet as upon some occasions they were used as a handle for oppression it was thought proper to abolish them altogether  IN the mean time letters of four forms continued to be the only warrant for personal execution upon decrees of the court of session But this court esteeming it a sort of impeachment upon their dignity to be worse appointed than inferior courts are with respect to personal execution took upon them  Act of sederunt  to abolish letters of four forms and to appoint the same letters of horning to pass upon their own decrees that by statute were authorized to pass upon decrees of inferior courts That decrees of the supreme court should at least be equally privileged with those of inferior courts is a proposition that admits not a dispute I cannot however without indignation  reflect upon the preamble of the act of sederunt asserting that letters of horning properly so called are a form of execution less burdensome upon debtors than letters of four forms which is a bold attempt to impose upon the common sense of mankind  To compleat this short history there only remains to be added in point of fact that to obtain a warrant for personal execution it is scarce ever necessary as our law now stands to apply to the court of session for a decree of interposition By the regulations concerning the commissary court a more curt method was introduced for obtaining letters of horning upon the precepts of the commissaries of Edinburgh which is that the court of session upon an application to them by petition should instantly issue a warrant for letters of horning And the same method was prescribed in all the statutes above mentioned that authorized letters of horning upon decrees of inferior courts  WHEN we compare our form of personal execution with that of England we perceive a wide difference In England the  capias ad satisfaciendum  is a writ directed to the sheriff to imprison the person of the debtor until he give satisfaction to his creditor of which the consequence is that payment made by the debtor intitles him of course to his liberty But in Scotland an act of warding excepted a debtor is not committed to prison upon account merely of his failing to make payment He must be denounced rebel before a  capias  or caption can be issued At the same time this  capias  is not  ad satisfaciendum  it is built upon a different foundation Imprisonment is one of the penalties of rebellion and our  capias  is issued against the person not as debtor but as rebel The debtor accordingly by the words of our caption must remain in prison  "till he be relaxed from the process of horning"  that is obtain the King's pardon for his rebellion For this reason it is that tendering  the sum due is not in strict law sufficient to save the debtor from prison Nor after imprisonment will he be entitled to his freedom upon tendering the sum till he also obtain letters of relaxation The court of session indeed dispensed with this formality in small debts  "declaring the creditor's consent sufficient for the debtor's liberation when the sum exceeds not merks  Act of sederunt th February  "  TRACT XII  HISTORY OF EXECUTION for obtaining payment after the death of the debtor  IN handling this subject I cannot hope fully to gratify the reader's curiosity otherwise than by traceing the history of this branch of law from remote ages It will be necessary not only to gather what light we can from the rules of common justice but also to examine the laws of England and of old Rome which have been copied by us in different periods  THE great utility of money as a commercial standard made it from the time of its introduction a desirable object It came itself to be one of the principal subjects of commerce and of contracts of loan When money is lent it is the duty of the debtor to pay the sum at the term covenanted and to procure money by a sale of his goods if he cannot otherwise satisfy his creditor If the debtor be refractory or negligent it is the duty of the judge to interpose and to direct a sale of the goods in order that the creditor may draw his payment out of the price  IN what manner debts are to be made effectual after the debtor's death by the rules of common justice is a speculation more involved One thing is obvious that if no person claim the property of the goods as heir or by other legal title the creditors ought to have the same remedy that they had during their debtor's life In this case there is required no stretch of  authority On the contrary when a debtor's goods after his death are sold for payment of his debts the law is no further exerted than to supply the defect of will which it is presumed the debtor would have interposed had he been alive whereas when a debtor's goods are sold during his life by publick authority his property is wrested from him against his will  BUT now an heir makes his appearance and the property is transferred to him by right of succession Justice will not allow him to enjoy the heritage of his ancestor without acknowledging his ancestor's debts Therefore if he submit not to pay the whole debts one of two things must necessarily follow either that he account to the creditors for the value of the heritage or that he consent to a sale for their behoof Justice as appears to me cannot be fulfilled but by pursuing the latter method and my reasons for thinking so are two The first is that by natural justice creditors  have access to the effects only of their debtor and have no claim against his issue or other relations and therefore that these effects ought to be surrendered to the creditors for their payment unless the heir by making full payment put an end to the claim which the creditors have to these effects The next is that sale which is the only unexceptionable method for determining the value of a commercial subject ought for that reason to be preferred by judges before the more uncertain opinion of witnesses For the  praetium affectionis  of the heir supposing the thing ought not to weigh against the more solid interest of creditors who are  certantcs de damno evitando  not to mention that an heir who hath an affection for the subject may gratify his affection by offering the smallest sum above what another esteems the intrinsick value  THE Romans with respect to heirs had a peculiar way of thinking which must be  explained because it relates to the subject under consideration An heir in the common sense of mankind is that person who by blood or by will is entitled to the effects of a person deceased and the succession of an heir is a method established by law for vesting in a living person effects which belonged to another at his death Hence it is that with respect to different subjects the same person may have different heirs as for example an heir of blood may succeed to some subjects and an heir by will to others The idea of an heir in the Roman law is not derived from the right of succeeding to the heritage in general or to any particular subject but rests upon a very different foundation The Roman people were distinguished into tribes or  gentes  A tribe was composed of different  familiae  and a  familia  of different  stirpes  and while the republick stood it was one great branch of their police to preserve names and families distinct from each other To perpetuate old families  the privilege of adoption was bestowed upon those who had not children The person adopted who assumed the name of the family came in place of a natural son and had all the privileges that by law belong to a natural son This branch of the Roman police produced a singular conception of an heir  viz  the bearing the name of the family and continuing the chain of the family in place of the person deceased The succession of an heir among the Romans had no relation to property was not considered as a right of succeeding to subjects but as a right of succeeding to the person deceased of coming in his place of representing him and of being as termed in the Roman law  eadem persona cum defuncto  In a word an heir in the Roman law is he who represents the deceased personally and the representing the deceased with respect to subjects of property doth not less or more enter into the Roman definition of an heir Nor was it at all necessary that this circumstance should enter the definition it  was sufficient that every benefit of succession was the unavoidable consequence of personal representation which obviously is the case If an heir is  eadem persona cum defuncto  succession in the eye of law makes no change of person and consequently not even a change of property Hence the maxim in the Roman law that  Nemo potest mori pro parte testatus et pro parte intestatus  For if an heir was adopted or named his personal representation of the testator entitled him of course to every subject and every privilege that belonged to the testator  THIS singular notion of an heir among the Romans gave creditors a benefit which they have not by common justice The death of their debtor if he was represented by an heir made no alteration in their affairs A debtor who had a representative died not in a legal sense his existence was continued in his heir without change of person The heir accordingly was subjected  to all the debts whether he had or had not any benefit by the succession and if the heir proved dilatory or refractory his whole effects might be sold for payment as well what belonged properly to himself as what he acquired by succession This undoubtedly was a stretch beyond the rules of common justice for creditors ought not to gain by the death of their debtor and an heir ought not to suffer by his succession But to palliate this injustice an heir had a year to deliberate whether he should accept of the succession and if he made it his choice to accept and to run all hazards which sometimes produced loss instead of gain this being his own choice was reckoned no such hardship as to deserve a remedy But this notion of an heir beneficial to the creditors in one respect was hurtful to them in another For where the heir's proper debts exceeded his own funds his creditors had access to the funds of the ancestor which were now become their debtor's property by succession Here was real injustice  done to the ancestor's creditors which in course of time was remedied by the Praetor He decreed a  separatio bonorum  and authorized the ancestor's funds to be sold for payment of his debts  l ยง de separationibus    THE gross injustice of subjecting an heir to the debts of the ancestor without limitation produced in time another remedy  viz  the benefit of inventory by which upon making an exact list of the ancestor's effects an exception in equity was given to the heir to protect him from being further liable personally than to the value of the goods contained in the list Whether this value was to be ascertained by the opinion of witnesses or whether the heir was bound to sell the goods for payment of the ancestor's debts is not clear But the latter seems to have been the rule as may be gathered not only from the reason of the thing but from the constitution of Justinian introducing this remedy  l ยง C de jure delib  And in  our practice though an heir who has the benefit of inventory is not liable personally beyond the value of the goods in the inventory to be ascertained by a proof yet if the creditors chuse to take themselves to the goods for their payment it is in their power to bring the same to sale and to lay hold of the price for their payment  BUT however far the Roman law strayed from the common rules of justice where the debtor's heritage was claimed by an heir the same complaint does not ly in the case of insolvency where the heir abandoned the succession for the debtor's goods were in this case sold for payment of his debts in the same manner as when he was alive It is true that among the Romans remarkable originally for virtue and temperance it was ignominious for a citizen to have his effects sold by publick authority To prevent such disgrace it was common to institute a slave as heir who after the testator's death being obliged to enter the  hereditary subjects were sold as his property and the real debtor's name was not mentioned  Instit de hered qualit et diff ยง Heineccius antiquit L Tit ยง    WE proceed to the English law which in all probability was antiently the same with our own And to understand the spirit of that law it must be premised that while the feudal law was in its purity a vassal had no landproperty he had only the profits of the land for his wages and when he died his service being at an end there could no longer be a claim for wages The subject returned to the superior and he drew the whole profits till the heir appeared who was entitled by the original covenant upon performing the same service with his ancestor to demand possession of the land as his wages If his claim was found just the possession was delivered to him by a very simple form  viz  an order or precept from  the superior to give him possession and this was called  renovatio feudi  There is nothing to be laid hold of in any branch of this process for making the heir liable to the ancestor's debts By performing the feudal services every heir is entitled to the full enjoyment of the land in name of wages and his right being thus limited he hath no power of disposal or of contracting debt to affect the subject farther than his own interest reaches The next heir who succeeds is not liable to the predecessor's debts because the land is delivered to the next heir not as the predecessor's property but as the property of the superior and possession is given to the next heir as wages for the service he hath undertaken to perform From this short sketch it must be evident that while the feudal law subsisted in its purity a vassal's debts after his death however effectual against his moveables could not burden the land nor the heir who succeeded to the land  BUT after land was restored to commerce and a vassal was understood to be in some sort proprietor so as even to have a power of alienation it was a natural consequence that the land as his property should be subjected for payment of his debts not only during his life but even after his death And indeed if a man's moveables can after his death be attached for payment of his debts why not his land supposing him equally proprietor of both Accordingly by the law of England  "Judgments of all kinds whether  in foro contentioso  or by consent may be made effectual by an  elegit  after the debtor's death as well as during his life without necessity of taking a new judgment against the heir  New abridgment of the law vol II page  "  A judgment by the law of England hath still greater force  "Lands are bound from the time of the judgment so that execution may be of these though the party aliens  bona fide  before execution sued out  New abridgment of the law vol II page  "  For if an  elegit  can be taken out to attach land conveyed after the judgment to a  bona fide  purchaser it is not so great a stretch to make it attach land after the debtor's death in the hand of the heir or  in hereditate jacente  if the heir be not entered  THE same method takes place in other debts upon which there is no judgment against the debtor with this only variation that the creditor must begin with taking a decree against the heir because the authority of a decree is necessary for execution The decree taken against the heir is in this case of the nature of a decreet of cognition with us to be a foundation for attaching the deceased debtor's heritage but not to have any personal effect against the heir nor against his proper estate  Ibid vol III page    NOR is it difficult to discover the foundation of this practice It depends on a principle of justice which is simple and obvious that every man's proper effects ought to be applied for payment of his debts His death can have no such effect naturally as to withdraw these effects from his creditors nor can it have such effect as to subject the heir who ought not to be liable for debts not of his own contracting unless so far as he converts to his own use the ancestor's effects which are the only fund destined by law for payment of the ancestor's debts  THE natural principle which prevails in England that an heir is not subjected to his ancestor's debts but only the ancestor's own funds produced another effect which is to vest in the heir the property of the ancestor's heretable estate even without exerting any act of possession The very survivance of the heir gives him in the lawlanguage of England legal seisin that  is gives him all the advantages of real possession and justly because his  animus possedendi  is presumed and must always be presumed where the apprehending possession is attended with no risk This is the sense of the maxim  Quod mortuus sasit vivum  which obtains in France as well as in England and of which we now see the foundation This branch of the law of England is not more beautiful by its simplicity than by its equity and expediency Nothing can be more simple or expedient than by mere survivance to vest in the heir the estate that belonged to the ancestor and nothing can be more equitable than a  separatio bonorum  by which the funds of the ancestor are set apart for payment of his debts without vexing the heir who in common justice ought not to be liable but for debts of his own contracting  WE have great reason to presume as to this matter that our law was once the same with that of England though we have  now adopted different maxims deviating far from natural equity and from the simplicity and expediency of the English law That our law was the same will readily be believed when in this country of old we find the same effect given to judgments that at present is given in England In the d statute Robert I cap ยง it is laid down with respect to debts due to merchants  "That in execution against the lands of the debtor sasine shall be given of all the lands which belonged to the debtor at the time of entering into the recognizance in whose ever hands they have since come whether by infeftment or otherwise"  This authority it is true relates to a decree of consent but we are not to suppose that it was more privileged than a judgment  in foro contentioso  and if so there could be no difficulty of making a judgment effectual against the debtor's land in the hands of his heir or  in hereditate jacente  And we find traces of this very thing in our old law In the above  mentioned d statutes Robert I ยง ult it is enacted  "That if a debtor die the merchant creditor shall not have his body but shall have execution against his lands as there above laid down"  that is by a brieve out of the chancery directed to the sheriff to deliver to the creditor all the goods and lands which belonged to the debtor by a reasonable extent The like execution is authorized Leg Burg cap even where the heir is entered But this is not all we have positive evidence that such was the practice in Scotland even after the beginning of the sixteenth century There is upon record a charter of apprising  anno  in favour of Richard Kine who having been decerned to pay  l  as cautioner for Patrick Wallance obtained letters after Patrick's death for apprising his land Patrick's heirs were edictally cited and his land was apprised and adjudged to Richard for payment to him of the said sum and this was done without any previous decree against  the heir or charge to enter A copy of this charter is annexed  Appendix No  and upon searching the records many more of the same kind may doubtless be found In a matter of such antiquity these authorities ought to convince us that as to execution against a debtor's landestate after his death our old law was the same with the English law and the same that continues to be the English law to this day  AND if such was the law of Scotland with respect to execution after the debtor's death upon decrees whether  in foro  or of consent we can have no reasonable doubt that the same form of execution did obtain where there was no judgment during the debtor's life with this variation only that there behoved to be a decree of cognition before execution could be awarded  A man who treads the dark paths of antiquity ought to proceed with circumspection  and be constantly on the watch We have entertained hitherto little doubt about the right road but in prosecuting our journey appearances are not quite so favourable We stumble unluckily upon the act p which seems to pronounce that far from proceeding in the right path we have been wandering this while In this statute it appears to be taken for granted that if the heir avoided entering to the land the ancestor's creditors had no means to recover payment Nay a remedy is provided by entitling them to apprise the land after charging the heir to enter The act it is true is conceived in terms so ambiguous as to make it doubtful whether the remedy concerns the creditors of the ancestor or those of the heir But that it is calculated to relieve the former only all our authors agree And we have a still greater authority  viz  the act p which proceeding upon the narrative that the said statute regards the creditors only of the deceased  extends the same remedy to creditors of the heir This in effect is declaring not only that the creditors of the heir before the had no execution against the ancestor's land unless the heir their debtor was pleased to enter but also that not even the creditors of the ancestor had before the act any execution against the land unless the heir who was not their debtor was pleased to enter  THESE are weighty authorities in support of the sense universally given to the statute And yet that the common law of Scotland should impower every heir of a landestate by abstaining from the succession to forfeit the creditors of his ancestor is a proposition too repugnant to the common principles of justice to gain credit This proposition will appear still more absurd by bringing the superior into the question The land returned to him if the heir did not submit to be his vassal but a good understanding betwixt them perhaps for a  valuable consideration might entitle the heir to hold the land in defiance of all the creditors To accomplish a scheme so fraudulent no more was necessary but a private agreement that the land should return to the superior by escheat and be afterwards restored to the heir by a new grant A contrivance so grossly unjust would not have been tolerated in any country We had apprisings of land as early as the reign of Alexander II I have demonstrated above that it is no stretch of legal authority to issue this execution after the debtor's death more than during his life and that the heir hath no title to prevent this execution whether he be entered or not entered Let it further be considered that by our oldest law the heir was liable even for moveable debts where the moveables were deficient  Reg Maj L cap ยง  What then was to bar law from taking its natural course It is certain there lay no bar in the way and the necessity of such an execution  must have been obvious to the meanest capacity in order to fulfil the rules of common justice not to mention its utility for supporting credit and extending commerce  BUT it is losing time to argue thus at large about the construction of a statute The above mentioned charter makes it clear that the statute cannot relate to the creditors of the ancestor By that charter it is vouched that in the execution against the debtor's estate proceeded after his death with as little ceremony as during his life The practice must have been the same in the and therefore as the creditors of the deceased had no occasion for a remedy the remedy provided by the statute must have been intended for the creditors of the heir And to fortify this construction there is luckily discovered another remarkable fact Our sovereign court so far from doubting of the privilege that creditors have to attach  the landestate of their debtor after his death ventured to authorize an apprising of the predecessor's estate upon the debt even of the heirapparent One instance of this I find in a charter of apprising th May granted by Queen Mary to the Master of Semple This charter subsumes  "That the Earl of Lennox in order to protect his familyestate from being attached for payment of a debt due by him personally to the Queen had refused to enter heir to the said estate that he had been charged to enter heir within twenty one days under certification that the lands should be apprised as if he were really entered and that he having disobeyed the charge the lands were accordingly apprised c  See a copy of this charter Appendix N  o    "  The date of the charge to enter is omitted in the charter but that it must have been before the statute is evident from the following circumstances that the statute is not mentioned in the charter and that the  charge is upon twenty one days which shows that it proceeded not upon the authority of the statute for in that case the charge must have been on forty days We have no reason to suppose this to be a singular instance nor is it mentioned in the charter as singular Here then is discovered an important link in the historical chain to wit that a charge against the heir to enter at the instance of his own creditor was introduced by the sovereign court without the authority of a statute And if this hold true the act could not be intended for any other effect but to confirm this former practice with the single variation that the charge to enter should be upon forty days in place of twenty one Viewing this curious fact in its true light it affords convincing evidence that before the the debtor's death did not bar his creditors from access to his estate For it is not consistent with the natural progress of improvements that the common law should be stretched in favour of the creditors  of the heirapparent while the predecessor's own creditors whose connection with his estate is incomparably stronger were left without a remedy These creditors must have been long secure before a remedy would be thought of for remoter creditors  viz  those of the heirapparent  BUT in combating the authority of the said act we must not rest satisfied with such proofs as may be reckoned sufficient in an ordinary case I add therefore other proofs that will probably be thought still more direct In the first edition of the statutes of James V bearing date th February the title prefixed to the statute under consideration is in the following words  "The remeid against them that lye out of their lands and will not enter in defraud of their creditors"  This clearly shows what was understood to be the meaning of the statute at the time it was enacted  viz  that it respects the creditors solely of the heirapparent And  the same title is also prefixed to the next edition which was in the The other proof I have to mention appears to be altogether decisive Upon searching the records it is discovered that the first charges given by authority of the statute were at the instance of creditors of heirsapparent one of them as early as the year This I take to be demonstrative evidence of the intendment of the statute for we cannot indulge so wild a thought as that our judges the very persons probably who framed this statute were ignorant of its meaning  As the foregoing arguments and proofs seem to be invincible we must acknowledge however unwillingly that our legislature when they made the act were in one particular ignorant of the law of their own country They are not however altogether without excuse I shall have occasion immediately to show that long before the year the old form of execution  against land after the death of the debtor simple and easy as it was had been abandoned and another form substituted not less tedious than intricate which considered in a superficial view might lead our legislature into an opinion that the creditors of the heirapparent were not provided for by the statute In fact they adopted this erroneous opinion which moved them to make the act  No sort of study contributes more to the knowledge of law than that which traces it through its different periods and changes Upon this account the foregoing enquiry though long will it is hoped not be thought tedious or improper In reality it is not practicable with any degree of perspicuity to handle the present subject without first ascertaining the true purpose of the act For according to the interpretation commonly received how ridiculous must the attempt appear of tracing from the beginning the form by  which debts are made effectual after the death of the debtor where the heir renounces or avoids entering while it remains an established opinion that creditors were left without a remedy till the statute was made  HAVING thus paved the way by removing a great deal of rubbish I proceed to unfold the principles that govern our present form of attaching land and other heretable subjects after the death of the debtor  IT is a matter which cannot rationally admit of a doubt that our notion of an heir was once the same with what is suggested by the common principles of law  viz  one who by will or by blood is entitled to succeed to the heritage of a person deceased wholly or partially Nay we have the same notion at present with respect to all heirs who succeed in particular subjects such as an heir of conquest  an heir male an heir of entail an heir of provision Nor is there the least reason or occasion to view even an heir of line in a different light For what more proper definition of an heir of line than the person who succeeds by right of blood to every heretable subject belonging to the deceased which is not by will provided to another heir And yet with respect to the heir of line we have unluckily adopted the artificial principles of the Roman law of a personal representation and of identity of person according to the Roman fiction that the heir is  eadem persona cum defuncto  The Roman law illustrious for its equitable maxims deserves justly the greatest regard But the bulk of its institutions however well adapted to the civil polity of Rome and the nature of its government make a very motley figure when grafted upon the laws of other nations In this country ever famous for love of novelty the prevailing esteem for the Roman law has been confined within no rational bounds Not  satisfied with following its equitable maxims we have adopted its peculiarities even where it deviates from the common principles of justice The very instance now under consideration without necessity of making a collection is sufficient to justify this reflection No man can hesitate a moment to prefer the beautiful simplicity and equity of our old law concerning heirs before the artificial system of the Romans by which an heir cannot demand what of right belongs to him without hazarding all he is worth in this world No regulation can be figured more contradictory to equity and expediency and yet such has been the influence of the Roman law that as far as possible we have relinquished the former for the latter that is with respect to general heirs for as to heirs of conquest heirs of provision and all heirs who succeed to particular subjects their condition is so opposite to that of an heir in the Roman law that it is impossible by any stretch of fancy to apply the Roman fiction to them  THIS unlucky fiction which supposes the heir and ancestor to be the same person hath produced that intricate form presently in use for recovering payment of debt after the death of the debtor The creditors originally had no concern with the heir their claim lay against their debtor's effects which they could directly attach for their payment whether  in hereditate jacente  or in the hands of the heir But when the maxim of representation and identity of person came to prevail the whole order of execution was reversed By the heir's assuming the character of representative and by becoming  eadem persona cum defuncto  the ancestor's effects are withdrawn from his creditors and are vested in the heir as formerly in the ancestor In a strict legal sense a debtor who has a representative dies not his existence is continued in his heir and the debtor is not changed In this view the heir comes in effect to be the original debtor and the creditors cannot reach the effects otherwise  than upon his failure of payment more than if he were in reality instead of fictitiously the original debtor  THE foregoing case of an heir's taking the benefit of succession is selected from many that belong to this subject in order to be handled in the first place for being of all the simplest it furnishes an opportunity to examine with the greater perspicuity what it was that moved our forefathers to give up their accustomed form of execution for that presently in use This new form of execution against the heir when entered was probably established long before the sixteenth century We discover from our oldest lawbooks and in particular from the Regiam Majestatem that our forefathers began early to relish the maxims of the Roman law And though in this book we discover no direct traces of the fiction that makes the heir and the ancestor to be the same person it is probable however considering the swift progress  of the Roman law in this country that the fiction obtained a currency with us not long after the Regiam Majestatem Hence it is likely that the old form of apprising the land for the predecessor's debt without regarding the heir must have been long in disuse in the present case where the property is by service transferred to the heir and who thereby is subjected personally to all the predecessor's debts This case undoubtedly gave a commencement to the form presently in use which requires that the estate be attached not as belonging to the ancestor the original debtor but as belonging to the heir In this view a decree goes against the heir making him liable for the debt and thereafter adjudication passes against the estate as his property and as for payment of his debt But though the new form commenced so early we have no reason to believe it was so early compleated Where an heir lyes out unentered and intermeddles not with the ancestor's effects he cannot in  that situation be held as  eadem persona cum defuncto  and an estate to which the heir lays no claim is naturally considered as still belonging to the ancestor For these reasons there was in this case nothing to obstruct the ancestor's creditors from attaching the estate by legal execution more than if their debtor were still alive Accordingly from the charter of apprising above mentioned granted to Richard Kine we find that where the heir did not enter the old form of attaching land was in use so late as the Nor have we reason to suppose that this was the latest instance of the kind for where the creditors of the ancestor are willing to confine their views to his estate without attacking the heir there cannot be a more ready method for answering their purpose than that of apprising the land which might be done with as little ceremony as when the debtor was alive A decree it is true was necessary for this execution as no execution can proceed without the authority of a judge but  it was a matter of no difficulty to obtain a decree if not already obtained against the debtor himself The form is to call the heir in a process not concluding against him personally but only that the debt is true and just The heir has no concern here but merely to represent a defendant and therefore a decree goes of course declaring the debt to be just This declaratory decree commonly called a decreet of cognition was held and to this day is held a sufficient foundation for execution  CONSIDERING that in the beginning of the sixteenth century creditors after their debtor's death had access to attach his land in the manner now mentioned and considering that a general charge was in practice before this time as will by and by be proved it appears to me evident that this writ was invented for no other purpose but to reach the heir and to subject him personally to the debts of his ancestor which may be gathered even from the writ  itself The heir was subjected if he entered and this was a contrivance to reach him if possible where he was not entered This writ as will be shown by and by produced the present form of execution for recovering payment after the debtor's death and thereby occasioned a considerable revolution in our law which makes it of importance to trace its history with all possible accuracy  To have a just notion of letters of general charge we must view the condition of an heirapparent with relation to the superior The heirapparent has a year to deliberate whether it will be his interest to enter to the land and subject himself to all the duties incumbent on the vassal And he may also continue to deliberate after the year runs out until he be compelled in the following manner to declare his will The superior obtains a letter from the King giving authority to charge or require the heir to enter within forty days under the  penalty of forfeiting his right to the feudal subject This furnished a hint to creditors who wanted to make the heir liable A similar form was invented which had the sanction of the sovereign court without a statute A creditor obtains a letter from the King giving authority to charge or require the heir to enter within forty days and to certify him that his disobedience shall subject him personally to the creditor in the same manner as if he were entered This letter commonly called Letters of General Charge being served on the heir obliges him to come to a resolution If he obey the charge by entering he is of course subjected to all his ancestor's debts If he remain in his former situation without entering the charge is a medium upon which he may be decerned personally to make payment to the creditor in whose favour the letter is issued and therefore to avoid being liable he has no other method but to renounce the succession which is done by a formal writing under  his hand put into the process or into the record  AT what time the general charge was introduced cannot with accuracy be determined That it was known long before the statute appears from a decision cited by Balfour dated  anno    Tit Heirs and Successors chap  in which it is mentioned as a writ in common and general use not at all as recent or newly invented Its antiquity is further ascertained by an argument which though negative must have considerable weight The court of session the same that is now in being was established  anno  and though the most ancient records of this court are not entire we have however pretty great certainty of its regulations such of them at least as are of importance for these where the records are lost may be gathered from our authors and from other authentick evidence But as there is not in any author or in any writing  the smallest hint that this writ was introduced by the court of session we have good reason to conclude that it had a more early date  THE better to understand what follows we must take a deliberate view of this new writ To supply defects in the common law is undoubtedly the province of the sovereign court and is one of its most valuable prerogatives But then regulations of this sort ought not only to be founded on necessity but also on material justice Unhappily neither of these grounds can be urged to justify letters of general charge For first this writ when invented was in no view necessary the common law giving ready access to a debtor's effects after his death for payment of his debts as well as during his life and beyond this a creditor can have no just claim In the next place this writ with respect to the heirapparent is oppressive and unjust for while the effects of the debtor ly open to execution  what earthly concern has the creditor with an heir who hath not claimed the succession nor intermedled with the effects and why should any attempt be indulged to subject a man to the payment of debt not of his own contracting This heteroclite writ procured in all appearance by the undue influence of creditors hath in its consequences proved even to them an unhappy contrivance It evidently produced our present form of obtaining payment after the debtor's death which as observed being unjust as to the heir has recoiled against the creditors by involving them in an execution intricate tedious and expensive opposite in every particular to the simple and beautiful form established in the common law I proceed to show in what manner the general charge produced a revolution so important  REFLECTING upon this subject it will be found that after the charge is given and the forty days elapsed the creditor  charging has it no longer in his power to retreat or in quality of the ancestor's creditor to attach by real execution the estate as belonging to the ancestor Such necessarily must be the effect of the change of circumstances occasioned by this charge If the heir obey the charge by entering he occupies the place of the ancestor he is in a legal sense the ancestor and execution proceeds against him and his effects precisely as if he were really and not by a fiction the original debtor This case therefore bars all access to the original form of execution The ancestor is withdrawn as if he had never been and upon that supposition the estate cannot be apprised as his property In the next place if the heir remain in his former situation without declaring his mind he becomes personally liable precisely as if he had entered This situation equally with the former and for the same reason bars the creditor from having access to the estate by the old form of execution So soon as the debt is transferred  against the heir he so far becomes  eadem persona cum defuncto  With regard to this debt he is considered to be the original debtor and as the creditor no longer enjoys the character of the ancestor's creditor he cannot have access to the estate as belonging to the ancestor neither can he have access to it as creditor to the heir who himself hath no right until he enter Again if the heir renounce the estate returns to the superior who must have the land if he have not a vassal and by this means also the creditor is excluded from all access to the land because it is now no longer the property either of the ancestor or of the heir These consequences of a charge where the heir enters not appear to to be strong obstacles against the creditor wanting to attach the land In what manner they were surmounted I shall endeavour to show  I begin with the case where the heirapparent after he is charged remains silent  and neither enters nor renounces The charge in this case for the reason above mentioned subjects him personally to the creditor at whose instance he is charged and by the same means he may be subjected to all the creditors So far good The creditors upon this medium may proceed to personal execution But as to real execution the difficulty is great for as above observed the debt by the charge being laid upon the heir there cannot be access to the land otherwise than as belonging to him But then how can land be adjudged from a debtor who is not vested in the property The reader will advert that he is engaged in a period long before the statute affording relief to the proper creditors of the heir by means of a special charge Admitting only the heir to be justly subjected to his ancestor's debts which with respect to what is now under consideration must be admitted it becomes unquestionably his duty to enter to the land in order to give the creditors access to it  for their payment And if he prove refractory it becomes the duty of the sovereign court to interpose and to perform for him by selling the land or at least by adjudging it to the creditors for their payment The latter was accordingly done But before attempting an extraordinary remedy as good order requires the debtor's obstinacy to be first ascertained a second letter in that view is obtained from the King giving authority to charge or require the heir to enter to the land within forty days and to certify him that after the lapse of this term he shall be held with respect to the creditors as actually entered This method solves all difficulties The creditors proceed to apprise the land from the heir now their debtor in the same manner as if he had a compleat title to the same by a solemn entry  IN the case of a renunciation the obstacle is much greater than in that last mentioned A renunciation to be heir according  to the nature of feudal property is a total bar to the ancestor's creditors which could not have been surmounted and ought not to have been surmounted while the feudal law was in vigour In the original feudal system an heir hath no claim to the land which his ancestor possessed unless he undertake to serve the superior in quality of a vassal and therefore if he refuse to submit to this service the superior enters to possess the land which antecedently was his property But a renunciation to be heir though obtained at the suit of a creditor being however an express declaration by the heir that he will not submit to be vassal must in strict law have the effect to restore the land to the superior and to cut out all the creditors This as observed would originally have been thought no hardship But at the time we adopted the notions of the Roman law the bulk of the land in Scotland had passed from hand to hand for a full price paid and such a purchase contrary to the original  constitution of the feudal law transferred the property to the purchaser though according to the form of our landrights he is obliged to assume the character of a vassal And therefore whatever effect a renunciation might have while a vassal's right was merely usufructuary it was rightly judged that it ought not to have the same effect where the vassal in reality is proprietor Equity pleaded strongly for the creditors that the superior  certans de lucro captando  ought not to be preferred to them  certantes de damno evitando  These considerations moved the sovereign court to think of some remedy for relieving the creditors It would have been too bold an attack upon established law to declare that in this case a renunciation should not operate in favour of the superior but only of the creditors The court took softer measures The law was permitted to have its course in restoring the land to the superior But action was sustained to the creditors against the superior to infeft them in the land for  security and payment of their debts and the decree given in this process obtained the name of an adjudication upon a renunciation to be heir or an adjudication  cognitionis causa  which being afterwards modelled into a different form passes now commonly under the name of an adjudication  contra hereditatem jacentem  Here was invented a new sort of execution against land similar in its form to no other sort in practice And it may be thought strange why the court in imitation of the established form of apprising did not rather direct the land to be sold for payment of the creditors In matters of so great antiquity where history affords scarce any light it is difficult to give satisfaction upon every point I can form no conjecture more probable than that in contriving a remedy against the hardships of the common law the court thought they had no sufficient authority to award a compleat execution such as was given by the common law and that it was venturing far enough to afford the  creditors a security upon land which once indeed belonged to their debtor but was now legally transferred to the superior with whom they had no connection  WITH respect to other heretable subjects allodial in their nature as not held of any superior heirship moveables for example bonds secluding executors and dispositions of land without infeftment the heirs renunciation created no difficulty Subjects of this kind are by the renunciation left  in media  without an owner and it is an obvious as well as a natural step to adjudge them to a creditor for his payment By such adjudication the court doth nothing but what the debtor himself ought to have done when alive and which it is presumed he would have done had he not been prevented by death This particular adjudication it is probable was the first that came into use and paved the way to an adjudication of land when it returned to the superior by the heir's renunciation  IF the general charge be of an ancient date we cannot have much difficulty about the aera of the special charge For as the general charge is a very imperfect remedy without the special charge the invention of the latter could not be at any distance of time from the establishment of the former And a fact is mentioned above which puts this matter beyond conjecture Before the statute we find relief by a special charge afforded even to the proper creditors of the apparent heir which proves to conviction that the same relief must have been afforded long before to the creditors of the ancestor after the heir is made liable by a general charge For as above observed it is not supposable that a remedy afforded to the proper creditors of the heirapparent would be denied to the creditors of the deceased proprietor who are more connected with the estate According to the natural course of human improvements the creditors of the deceased proprietor must have been long privileged with a special  as well as with a general charge before it would be thought proper to extend the privilege of a special charge to the creditors of his heirapparent  IT appears from Craig  L Dieg ยง  that an adjudication  cognitionis causa  is the remedy which of all came latest We have this author's express authority for saying that in his time it was a recent invention Nor is this at all wonderful For a renunciation to be heir must to the ancestor's creditors be a puzzling circumstance when its legal effect is to restore the land to the superior who is liable for none of the vassal's debts  TAKING under review the foregoing innovations to which we were insensibly led by the prevailing influence of the Roman law it is probable that the fiction of identity of person was first applied by our lawyers to the case where an heir regularly  enters to the estate of his ancestor Being in this case beneficial to creditors who have the heir bound as well as the estate it gained credit and obtained a currency Nor was it attended with any inconvenience to creditors at least while they had access to apprise as formerly the estate of their debtor where the heir abstained from entering This one should think was affording to creditors every privilege they could justly demand for obtaining payment But this did not satisfy them To have the heir bound personally in place of his ancestor was an enticing prospect and the general charge was invented in order to make him liable before his entry and where he has not taken the benefit of the succession This legal step it must be acknowledged is pretty well contrived to answer its purpose The heir urged by a general charge hath no way to evade the certification of being personally liable other than the hard alternative of renouncing altogether the succession This new form  for that reason was much relished Creditors did not chuse to confine themselves to the estate of the ancestor their debtor while any hope remained of subjecting the heir personally by means of a general charge And accordingly for a century and a half or perhaps more it has been the constant method to set out with a general charge where the heir is not entered If this method to subject the heir personally prove successful the creditors as made out above must bid adieu to the estate considered as  in hereditate jacente  of their original debtor Having chosen the heir for their debtor they cannot now attach the estate otherwise than in quality of his creditors Thus it has happened that during so long time as that now mentioned there is no instance of following out the old form by apprising or adjudging the land after the debtor's death without regarding the heir Whether it may be thought too late now to return to this old form governed by the principles of  justice as well as of expediency I take not upon me to determine  THE difference betwixt the law of Scotland and of England as to the present subject will be clearly apprehended by setting the matter in the following light A pure donation which doth not subject the donee to any obligation transfers property without the necessity of acceptance and upon that account infants and absents are benefited by such deeds without knowing any thing of the matter But a deed laying the donee under any burden bestows no right without actual acceptance if it did any man might be subjected to the severest burdens without his consent Thus in England the rule obtains  Quod mortuus sasit vivum  because an heir though vested in his ancestor's heritage is not subjected personally to his ancestor's debts In Scotland again the effects of the ancestor are not transmitted to the heir but by means of some voluntary act which imports the  consent of the heir to subject himself to his ancestor's debts For by our law a strict connection is formed betwixt the right that the heir has to the ancestor's estate and the obligation he is under to pay the ancestor's debts so far at least as that the latter is a necessary consequence of the former It may indeed happen that the heir is made liable to pay the ancestor's debts without being vested in the estate but this is to be considered as a penalty for refusing to enter heir when he is charged or for intermeddling irregularly with the ancestor's effects which are singular cases  THE matter of the foregoing history is so singular as not perhaps to have a parallel in the law of any country Here from the dead law of an ancient people we find a metaphysical fiction adopted without any foundation in the common rules of justice and repugnant in a peculiar manner to the common law of this island and yet so fervently impraced as  to have made havock of every part of our law that stood in opposition I have pointed out some of the many inconveniencies that its reception produced with regard to creditors and consequently to credit I have shown what subterfuges and fictitious contrivances were necessary in order to give it a currency I have shown how tedious how intricate and how expensive a form it hath occasioned for recovering payment of debt but I have not yet shown it in its worst light The evils I have mentioned are mere triffles compared with those that follow No person who hath given any attention to the history of our law can be ignorant of the numberless artifices invented by heirs in possession of the familyestates to screen themselves from paying the familydebts The numberless regulations made in vain age after age to prevent such artifices will satisfy every one that there must be an error in the first concoction by which a remedy is rendered extremely difficult  How comes it that we never hear of such frauds in England The reason is obvious The just and natural rule of a  separatio bonoruni  which obtains there makes it impracticable for the heir to defraud his ancestor's creditors They have no concern with the heir but take themselves to the ancestor's estate for their payment In Scotland the ancestor's estate cannot be reached even by his own creditors otherwise than by attacking the heir unless he be pleased to abandon it to the creditors But this seldom was the case of old The heir had a more profitable game to play even where the estate was overburdened with debts His method generally was to renounce to be heir in order to evade a personal decerniture but he did not however abandon the estate It was seldom difficult to procure some artificial or sictitious title to the estate under cover of which possession was apprehended and this was a great point gained If such title after a dependance perhaps for years was  found insufficient to bar the creditors another title of the same kind was provided and so on without end It is true the heir's renunciation entitles the creditors to attach the estate by adjudications  cognitionis causa  but then the heir as has been observed was always provided with some collateral title not only to colour his possession but also to compete with the creditors In the mean time the rents were a fund in his hands to take off any of the preferable creditors that were like to prove too hard for him And such purchase was a new protection to the unconscientious heir against the other creditors In fact the most considerable estates in Scotland are possest at this day by such dishonest titles the legislature however willing never having been able to invent any compleat remedy to prevent such pernicious frauds The foregoing observations will enable us to trace these artifices to their true source They must be ascribed to the fiction of identity of perron because by  means of this fiction chiefly opportunity was furnished for committing these frauds Had this matter been seen by our legislature in its proper light a very simple and very effectual remedy must have occurred to them If the heir refused to subject himself to the debts of his ancestor nothing else was necessary but to restore the ancient law authorising the ancestor's heritage to be sold for payment of his debts But this regulation had been long in disuse and we were not less ignorant of it than if it never had existed  AND as an evidence of the weakness of human foresight I must observe that a statute made without any view to the frauds of heirs proved more successful against these frauds than all the regulations purposely made and that is the statute for selling the estates of bankrupts An heir has now very little opportunity to play the accustomed game when it is in the power of creditors to wrest the estate out of his hands by a publick  auction And the experience now of  ifty years has vouched this to be a compleat remedy For we hear not at present of any frauds of this kind nor are we under any apprehension of them So far from it that we are receding more and more every day from the rigid principle of an universal representation and approaching to the maxim of equity which subjects not the heir beyond the value of the succession For what other reason is it that the act introducing some new rigid passive titles is totally neglected though it is undoubtedly an additional safeguard to creditors against the frauds of heirs We are not now afraid of these frauds they are prevented by the equitable remedy of selling the ancestor's estate and judges if they have humanity will be loath to apply a severe remedy when a mild one is at hand which is also more effectual It is remarkable that though the act for selling the estates of bankrupts proved an effectual remedy yet this virtue  in the statute was not an early discovery It was not discovered at the time of the act and if any person of more than ordinary penetration had been looking on when that statute was made it must have provoked a smile to find our legislature with their eyes open contriving an imperfect remedy when they had already with their eyes shut stumbled on one that was perfect  TRACT XIII  HISTORY OF The LIMITED and UNIVERSAL Representation of Heirs  BY the law of nature an heir beyond what he takes by the succession is not subjected to the debts of his ancestor In the Roman law a singular notion was adopted that the heir is the same person with the ancestor Hence an heir in the Roman law succeeds to all the effects of the ancestor and is subjected to all his debts This was carried so far with regard  to children that they were heirs  ex necessitate juris  and upon that account were distinguished by the name of  sui et necessarii heredes  Natural principles afterwards prevailed and children in common with other heirs were privileged to abstain from the succession This was done by a  separatio bonorum  and by abandoning the goods of the ancestor to his creditors But still if the heir took possession of the ancestor's effects or in any manner behaved as heir he from that moment was understood to be  eadem persona cum defuncto  and consequently was subjected universally to all the ancestor's debts At last the benefit of inventory was afforded which protected the heir from being liable farther than  in valorem  This privilege tempered the severity of the foregoing artificial principle and in a manner restored the law of nature which had been overlooked for many ages  IN England the artificial principle of identity of person never took place An  heir by the English law is not bound to pay his ancestor's debts even when he takes by succession The creditors have the privilege of attaching their debtor's effects possessed by the heir in the same manner as when these effects were in the debtor's own possession during his life The heir is personally liable to the extent only of what he intermeddles with The English law indeed deviates from natural justice in making a distinction betwixt the heritable and moveable debts subjecting the heir to the former only and the executor to the latter This is evidently unjust as to creditors for they may be forfeited by their debtor's death though he die in opulent circumstances which as to personal creditors must always happen when his moveable funds are narrow and his moveable debts extensive Such a regulation is the less to be justified that it furnisheth an opportunity for fraud For what if a man with a view to disappoint his personal creditors after his death shall lay out all his money upon land  I know of no remedy to this evil unless the court of chancery moved by a principle of equity venture to interpose  BY the feudal law when in purity there could not be such a thing as representation because the heir took the land not as coming in place of his ancestor but by a new grant from the superior But when land was restored to commerce and was purchased for a full price it was justly reckoned the property of the purchaser though held in the feudal form Land by this means is subjected to the payment of debt even after it descends to the heir And in Scotland probably the privilege at first was carried no farther than in England to permit creditors after the death of their debtor to attach his funds in possession of the heir  BUT as Scotland always has been addicted to innovations the Roman law prevailed here contrary to the genius of our own law and the fiction was adopted of the  heir and ancestor being the same person This fiction crept first into the reasonings of our lawyers figuratively in order to explain certain effects in our own law and gained by degrees such an ascendant as in our apprehension to form the very character of an heir Yet considering the heirs of different kinds that are acknowledged with us an heir of line an heirmale an heir of provision c one should not imagine that our law lay open to have this fiction grafted upon it In the Roman law there was but one heir who succeeded  in universum jus defuncti  and who by a very natural figure might be stiled  eadem persona cum defuncto  But can we apply this figure with any propriety to an heir who succeeds not  in universum jus  but is limited to a particular subject This opens a scene which I shall endeavour to set in a just light by examining how far the figure has been carried with us and what bounds ought to be set to it  OUR law in all probability was once the same with that of England  viz  that the heir who succeeds to the real estate is liable to real debts only the moveable debts being laid upon the executor But this did not long continue to be our law It must sometimes have happened notwithstanding the frugality of ancient times that the personal estate was not sufficient for satisfying the personal debts It was in this case justly thought hard that the heir should enjoy the familyestate while the personal creditors of his father or other ancestor were left without remedy Equity dictates that after the moveables are exhausted the personal creditors shall have access to the land for what remains due to them This practice is with us of an early date We find it established in the reign of David II as appears from the Regiam Majestatem  Lib cap ยง  And it was improved to the benefit of creditors by statute  Act p  enacting  "That if the personal creditors are  not paid out of the moveables within the year they shall without further delay have access to the heir"  Upon the same foundation and by analogy of the statute the executor is made liable for the heretable debts This came in late for Sir Thomas Hope  Minor Practicks ยง  observes  "That the Lords of old were not in use to sustain process against the executor for payment of an heretable debt"  And he is so little touched with the equity of the innovation as to censure and condemn it for a very insufficient reason indeed  "because says he there is no law to give the executor relief against the heir as the heir has against the executor when he pays a moveable debt"  as if this relief did not follow from the nature of the thing Reviewing this historical deduction I cannot perceive in it the slightest symptom of identity of person This fiction admits not of a distinction betwixt heretable and moveable subjects Identity of  person bestows necessarily upon the heir every subject that belonged to the ancestor Neither admits it of any distinction among debts for if the deceased was liable to all debts without distinction so must the heir In place of which we find the heir of line subjected by the common law to heretable debts only and not to moveable debts otherwise than upon a principle of equity which if the moveables be not sufficient subjects the landestate rather than that the creditors should suffer  IT is then evident that in our practice there is no place for this fiction even with regard to the heir of line and that this heir is subjected universally to his ancestor's debts without any foundation in the common law and even without any foundation in the fiction itself For as an heir of line is clearly not  eadem persona cum defuncto  except as to the heretable estate it is equally clear that by authority of this fiction he ought not to be subjected universally  to any debts but what are heretable As to moveable debts equity dictates that creditors be preferred to every representative of their deceased debtor and therefore that the landestate should be subjected to the personal creditors when the moveables are not sufficient But this maxim of equity can never be extended farther against the heir than to make him liable for moveable debts so far as he is benefited by the succession because equity which relieves from oppression can never be made the instrument of oppression  IN the next place as to a limited heir succeeding to one subject only why ought he to be liable universally to the ancestor's debts If he represent the ancestor it is not universally but only as heir in a particular subject And therefore according to the nature of his representation he ought to be liable for debts only which affect that subject or for debts of the same kind with the subject or at farthest for debts of  every kind to the extent of the subject I know not that it has been held by any able writer far less decided that an heir provided to a particular subject is liable universally to the ancestor's debts Dirleton gives his opinion to the contrary in a most satisfying manner  Doubts Tit Heirs of Tailสie  His words are  "Heirs of provision and tailสie who are to succeed only  in rem singularem  albeit  titulo universali Quaeritur  if they will be liable to the defuncts whole debts though far exceeding the value of the succession or if they should be considered as  heredes cum beneficio inventarii  and should be liable only  secundum vires  there being no necessity of an inventory the subject of their succession being only as said is  res singularis  Answer It is thought that if one be served general heirmale without relation to a singular subject as to certain lands he would be liable  in solidum  but if he be served only special heir in certain lands he should be liable only  secundum vires  "  THE heir of line or heir general is then the only person to whom the character of identity of person can with any shadow of propriety be applied Nor to him can it be applied in the unlimited sense of the Roman law but only as to the heretable estate and heretable debts To all that is carried by a general service he has right without limitation and it is plausible if not solid that he ought to be liable without limitation to all heretable debts such as come under a general service We follow the same rule betwixt husband and wife when we subject him to her moveable debts in general and give him right to all her moveable effects in general And this at the same time appears to be the true foundation of the privilege of discussion competent to heirs whose right of succession is limited to particular subjects The general heir or heir of line who is not thus limited but succeeds in general to all subjects of a certain species is the only heir to whom the identity of person  can with any colour be applied and consequently is the only heir who ought to bear the burden of the debts  IT may be thought more difficult to explain why an heir of line making up titles by a service to a landestate which was the property of his ancestor should be subjected universally to his ancestor's debts when this very title  viz  his retour and seisin contains an inventory  in gremio  not being in its nature a general title but only a title to one particular subject  To explain this matter distinctly it will be necessary to carry our view pretty far back in the history of our law Among all nations it is held as a principle that property is transferred from the dead to the living without any solemnity Children and other heirs are entitled to continue the possession of their ancestor and where the heir is not bound for his ancestor's debts such possession is understood to be  continued by will alone without any ouvert act In Scotland the heir originally was not liable for the debts of his ancestor nor at present is he liable in England Hence it is that as to rentcharges bonds secluding executors and other heretable subjects which may be termed allodial because not held of any superior these were transferred to the heir of blood directly upon his survivance and with regard to these the same rule obtained here that obtains universally in England and France  Quod mortuus sasit vivum  Land and other subjects held of a superior are with us in a very different condition The vassal by the principles of the feudal law is not proprietor and strictly speaking transmits no right to his heir The subject must be claimed from the superior and the heir's title is a new grant from him Thus then stood originally the law of Scotland Heretable subjects vested in the heir merely by survivance The single exception was a feudal holding which required and still  requires a new grant from the superior If the heir of line had this new grant he needed no other title to claim any heretable subject which belonged to his ancestor But heirs were put in a very different situation by the fiction of identity of person adopted from the Roman law The heir by claiming the succession being subjected personally to his ancestor's debts must have an election to claim or to abandon as it suits his interest This of necessity introduced an  aditio hereditatis  as among the Romans without which the heir can have no title to the effects of his ancestor If he use this form he becomes  eadem persona cum defuncto  with regard to benefits as well as burdens If he abstain from using it he is understood to abandon the succession and to have no concern either with benefits or burdens The only point to be considered was what should be the form of the  Aditio  By this time the property being transferred from the superior to his vassal it was justly thought that the  vassal's heir who enjoyed the landestate of his ancestor could not evade payment of his debts For this reason an infeftment being the form established for transmitting the property to the heir the same form was now held as a proper  aditio hereditatis  to have the double effect not only of vesting the heir with the property as formerly but also of subjecting him to the ancestor's debts This title it is true being in its nature limited ought not to subject him beyond the value of the subject But then the identity of the ancestor and his heir being once established it was thought as in the Roman law to have an universal effect and to be an active title to every subject that could descend to the heir of line And our former practice tended mainly to support this inference for it was still remembered that formerly all allodial heretable subjects were vested in the heir of line upon his survivance merely The infeftment being thus held an  aditio hereditatis  not only with respect to the landestate but  with respect to all other heretable subjects it followed of course that the infeftment behoved also to be an universal passive title for if the heir succeeded to all heretable subjects without limitation it seemed not unreasonable that he should be subjected to all debts without limitation These conclusions it must be owned were far from being just or accurate It appears extremely plain that if a man die possest of a subject held of a superior and of other heretable subjects that are allodial the heir ought to be privileged to make a title to one or other at his pleasure and to be subjected accordingly to the debts that if he use a general service he must lay his account to be liable universally but that if he confine himself to a special service he is not to be liable beyond the value of the subject But our ancient lawyers were not so clear sighted They blindly followed the Roman law by attributing to the identity of person the most extensive effects possible An infeftment in the landestate  established this identity which it was thought did on the one hand entitle the heir of line to all the heretable subjects and on the other did subject him to all the debts And this affords a clear solution of the difficulty above mentioned If the identity of person take at all place it applies to none more properly than to an heir of blood who enters by infeftment especially as he generally is of the same name and family with his ancestor lives in the same house possesses the same estate and carries on the line of the same family  BUT now supposing the foregoing deduction to be just is there not great reason to alter our present practice and to hold a special service to be as it truly is in its nature and form a limited title Let us suppose that the heir of line unwilling to represent his ancestor universally chuses to abandon all the heretable subjects except a small landestate to which he makes up titles by a special service why should  he be liable universally in this case The natural construction of such a service is that the heir intends to confine himself to the subject therein mentioned and to abandon the ancestor's other estate since he forbears to take out a general service Such construction will better the condition of heirs by removing some part of the risk they run and will not hurt creditors so far as their claim is founded on natural equity  viz  to have their debtor's effects applied for payment of his debts  AND I must observe with some satisfaction that we have given this very construction to an infeftment upon a precept of  Clare Constat  it being an established rule that such infeftment is not a title to any other subject but that contained in the precept And for this very reason neither doth it make the heir liable for the debts of his ancestor farther than  in valorem  Lord Stair  Instit page at the foot  it is true considers a precept  of  Clare  as an universal passive title But the court of session entertained a juster notion of this matter A remarkable case is observed by Lord Harcus  Tit Heirs March Farmer  contra  Elder  to the following purpose  "A man infeft upon a precept of  Clare Constat  as heir to his father being pursued for payment of a debt that was due by his father pleaded an absolvitor upon the following medium that he had no benefit by the succession the subject to which he had connected by a precept of  Clare  being evicted from him"  It was answered  "That his entering heir by the precept of  Clare Constat  made him  eadem persona cum defuncto  that it was a behaviour as heir which subjected him to all his predecessor's debts without regard to the estate whether it was swallowed up by an earthquake or evicted by a process"  The Lords  "judged the defender not liable as heir in respect the land was evicted from him"  It was said that had there  been a general service or a special service which includes a general the matter would have been more doubtful especially if there were other subjects to which a general service gives right The plain inference from this judgment is that if eviction of the landestate relieve the heir from being liable to pay the familydebts the estate must be the measure of his representation and consequently that he is not liable beyond the value  THIS subject will perhaps be thought unnecessary now that the benefit of inventory is introduced into our law It is indeed less necessary than formerly but not however altogether useless In many instances heirs neglect to lay hold of this benefit and frequently the forms required by the statute are unskilfully or carelessly prosecuted so as to leave the heir open to the rigour of law in all which cases it comes to be an important enquiry how far an heir is liable for the  debts of his ancestor I cannot at the same time help remarking that it shows no true taste for science to relinquish a subject however beautiful merely because it appears not to be immediately useful The history of law which unfolds a subject in its natural as well as political progress can never be useless And taking it upon the lowest footing it enables us to compare our present with our former practice which always tends to instruction  TRACT XIV  OLD and NEW EXTENT  THE extents old and new make a part of our law which is involved in the dark clouds of antiquity These extents are not mentioned by our first writers and later writers satisfy themselves with loose conjectures which are the product of fancy without evidence The design of the present essay is to draw this subject from its obscurity into some degree of light It is a matter of curiosity and possibly may be not altogether unprofitable with relation especially to our retours of which these extents make an essential part  As the English brieve of  diem clausit extremum  approaches the nearest of any to  our brieve of inquest it may be of use to examine the English brieve and the  valent  clause therein contained Fitzherbert in his new nature of brieves  Page  explains this brieve in the following words  "The writ of  Diem clausit extremum  properly lieth where the King's tenant who holdeth of him  in capite  as of his crown by knights service or in soccage dieth seised his heir within age or of full age then that writ ought to issue forth and the same ought to be at the suit of the heir c for upon that when the heir cometh of full age he ought to sue for livery of his lands out of the King's hands"  And the writ is such  "Rex dilect sibi W de K escheatori suo in Com Deven Salut Quia W de S qui de nobis tenuit in capite diem clausit extremum ut accipimus tibi praecipimus quod omnia terras et tenementa de quibus idem W suit seisitus in dominico suo ut de feodo in Balliva tua die quo obiit sine dilatione cap in manum  nostram et ea salvo custodiri fac donec aliud inde praeceperimus et per sacramentum proborum et legal hominum de Balliva tua per quos rei veritas melius scire poterit diligent inquiras quantum terrae et tenementorum idem W tenuit de nobis in capite tam in dominico quam in servitiis in Balliva tua die quo obiit et quantum de aliis et per quod servic et quant terrae et tenementa illa  valent  per annum in omnibus exitibus et quo die idem W obiit et quis propinquior ejus heres sit et cujus aetatis et inquisic inde distincte et aperte fact nobis in cancell nostra sub sigillo tuo et sigillis eorum per quos fact fuerit sine dilatione mittas et hoc Breve Teste c"  At what time the question about the yearly rent of the land was ingrossed in this brieve is uncertain probably after the days of William the Conqueror for as all the lands in England were accurately valued in  that King's reign and the whole valuations collected into a record commonly called Domesday book this authentick evidence of the rent of every barony was a rule for levying the King's casualties as superior without necessity of demanding other evidence But domesday book could not long answer this purpose for when great baronies were dismembered each part to be held of the crown this book afforded no rule for the extent of the casualties to to be levied out of the lands of the new vassals An inquisition therefore was necessary to ascertain the yearly rents of the disjoined parcels and there could not be a more proper time for such enquiry than when the heir of a crown vassal was suing out his livery This seems to be a reasonable motive for ingrossing the foregoing question in the brieve And in England this enquiry was necessary upon a special account It was not the custom there to give gifts of the casualties of superiority Officers were appointed in every shire to take possession  in name of the King of the lands of his deceased vassals and to keep possession till the heirs were entered These officers called escheators were accountable to the crown for the rents and issues and for the other casualties and the rent of the land ascertained by the retour was the rule to the treasurer for counting with escheators  WE find not different values or extents in the English brieve like what we find in the Scotch brieve I shall endeavour to trace the occasion of the difference after premising a short history of our taxes carrying the matter as far back as we have evidence  TAXES were no part of the constitution of any feudal government The King was supported by the rents of his propertylands and by the occasional profits of superiority passing under the name of casualties These casualties such as ward nonentry marriage escheat c arose from the very nature  of the holding and beyond these the vassal was not liable to be taxed some singular cases excepted established by custom such as for redeeming the King from captivity for a portion to his eldest daughter and a sum to defray the expence of making his eldest son a knight For this reason it is natural to conjecture that the first universal tax was imposed upon some such singular occasion The first event we can discover in the history of Scotland to make such a tax necessary happened in the reign of William the Lyon This King was taken prisoner by the English at Alnwick th July and in December that year he obtained his liberty from Henry II upon a treaty by which he and his nobles subjected this Kingdom to the crown of England  Rymer vol I page  Hector Boece our fabulous historian says That upon this occasion William paid to Henry a hundred thousand merks But this seems to be asserted without any authority The dependency  of Scotland on the crown of England was a price sufficient for William's liberty without the addition of a sum of money and the silence of all other historians as to this fact joined with the great improbability that a sum so immense could be paid leave this author without excuse  RICHARD I who succeeded Henry bent upon a voyage to the holy land stood in need of great sums for the expedition William laid hold of this favourable conjuncture met Richard at York and upon paying down ten thousand merks Sterling obtained from him a discharge of the treaty made with his father Henry which was done by a solemn deed dated the th December still extant  Rymer vol I page    THE sum paid to King Richard upon this occasion was too great to be raised by the King of Scotland out of his own domains It must have been levied by a  tax or contribution and there was good reason for the demand as the money was to be applied for restoring the kingdom to its former independency But of this fact we have better evidence than conjecture The monks of the Cistertian order having contributed a share obtained from King William a deed declaring That this contribution should not be made a precedent in time coming  Appendix to Anderson's essay on the independency of Scotland N  o      "Ne quod in tali eventu semel factum est qui nec prius evenit nec in posterum Deo miserante futurus est ullo modo in consuetudinem vel servitutem convertatur ut videlicit per quod ipsi pro redimenda regni libertate gratis fecerunt servitus iis imponatur"  This in all probability was the first tax of any importance that was levied in Scotland and though our historians are altogether silent as to the manner the deed now mentioned proves it to have been levied by voluntary contribution  and not by authority of parliament which in those days probably had not assumed the power of imposing taxes  THE next tax we meet with is in the days of Alexander II son to the above mentioned William This King made a journey the length of Dover and his ready money being exhausted he procured a sum by pledging some lands to redeem which he levied a tax This appears from a deed  anno regni    o  in which he declares that the monastry of Aberbrothick having aided him on this occasion it should not turn to their prejudice  Chartulary of Aberbrothick fol    ALEXANDER III married Margaret daughter to Henry III of England and was in perfect good understanding with that kingdom during his whole reign He was but once obliged to take up arms and the occasion was to resist an invasion by Acho king of Norway who landed at Ayr  August nor was this war of any continuance Acho was defeated on land and his fleet suffered by a storm which obliged him to retire not many months after his landing Alexander some years thereafter  viz  th July  Rymer vol II p  contracted his daughter Margaret to Eric the young king of Norway and bound himself for a tocher of merks Sterling a fourth part to be instantly advanced a fourth part to be paid st August a fourth part st August and the remaining fourth st August but providing an option to give land for the two latter shares at the rate of merks of rent for merks of money  THIS sum which Alexander contracted in name of portion with his daughter amounted to about  l  Sterling of our present money  Ruddiman's preface to Anderson's Diplomata Scotiae  too great a sum to be raised out of his own funds and as by law he was  intitled to demand aid from his vassals upon this occasion there can be little doubt that the sum was levied by some sort of tax or contribution He had recent authority for laying this burden upon his subjects  viz  that of his fatherinlaw Henry III  Spelman's Glossary voce Auxilium  and if his subjects were to be burdened equally it was necessary to ascertain the value of the whole lands in the kingdom Possibly he might take a hint of this valuation from the statute th Edward I  anno  directing a valuation to be made of the lands castles woods fishings c of the whole kingdom of England And the rent ascertained by such valuation got the name of extent because the lands were estimated at their utmost value or extent  Cowel's Dictionary voce Extent  One thing is certain that there was a valuation of all the lands of Scotland in the reign of Alexander III the proof of which shall be immediately produced and there is not upon record any event to be a motive for  an undertaking so laborious other than levying the said sum  ALEXANDER III left no descendants but a granddaughter commonly called the Maid of Norway and she having died unmarried and under age Scotland was miserably harrassed by Edward I of England who laid hold of the opportunity of a disputed succession to enslave this kingdom Robert Bruce by unwearied opposition got peaceable possession of the crown  anno  and though he seized upon the lands belonging to Baliol and the Cummins and made considerable profit by lessening the weight of money in the recoinage yet by a long train of war and intestine commotions the crownlands were so wasted that towards the end of his reign it became necessary for him to petition the parliament for a supply Upon the th July the parliament being conveened at Cambuskenneth the laity agreed to give him during his life the tenth penny of all  their rents  tam infra burgos et regalitates quam extra  "according to the old extent of the lands and rents in the time of Alexander III"  This curious deed a copy of which is annexed  Appendix N  o    contains an exception in these words  "Excepta tantummodo destructione guerrae in quo casu fiet decidentia de decimo denario praeconcesso secundum quantitatem firmae quae occasione praedicta de terris et redditibus praedictis levari non poterit prout per inquisitionem per vicecomitem loci fideliter faciendam poterit reperiri"  HERE is compleat proof of a valuation in the reign of Alexander III named in the indenture the  Old Extent  And as the necessity of the case affords real evidence that the tax was levied we have no reason to doubt that every man whose rents had fallen by the distresses of war took the benefit of the foregoing clause to get his lands revalued by the sheriff that he  might pay no more than a just proportion of the tax  WE have now materials sufficient for an explanation of the  valent  clause in our retours At what time it came into practice is altogether uncertain If this clause was not made a part of the brieve of inquest before the days of Alexander III there was little occasion for it after the extent made in that reign till the great baronies were split into parts and the King's vassals were multiplied One thing we may rely on as certain that before the when the said indenture passed between King Robert and his parliament one extent only was mentioned in retours  viz  that of Alexander III Nor before that period was there any occasion for a double extent here more than in England Of this I reckon we may be convinced by what follows In levying the casualties of superiority such as ward nonentry c it was not the genius of this country to  stretch such claims to the utmost by stating the just and true rent of the land upon every occasion Such a fluctuating estimation severe upon vassals would at the same time have been troublesome to superiors The King and in imitation of him other superiors were satisfied with a constant fixed rent to be a general rule for ascertaining the casualties without regarding any occasional increase or diminution of rent The extent in the reign of Alexander III was probably the full rent and must have continued a pretty just valuation for many years This extent then became the universal measure of the casualties of superiority If a barony remained entire as in the days of Alexander III there was no occasion for witnesses to prove the rent it was found in the rolls containing the old extent If a barony was split into parts the rent of the several parcels was found in the retours being a proportion of the old extent of the whole Hence this  quaere  in the brieve  Quantum  valent dictae terrae per annum  came to have a fixed and determined meaning not what these lands are worth of yearly rent at present but what they were worth at the last general valuation or in other words what they are computed to in the rolls containing the old extent  THUS the matter stood and behoved to stand at the date of the indenture which laid a foundation for a revaluation not of the whole lands in Scotland but only of what were wasted by war Supposing now such a revaluation of which we can entertain no reasonable doubt when it was in favour of vassals it behoved to be the rule not only for levying the tax then imposed but also for ascertaining the casualties of superiority If so it was necessary to take notice of this new valuation in the retours of these lands and consequently in the brieve which was the warrant of the retour The clause  quantum valent  contained in the brieve could not  answer this purpose because that clause regarded only the old extent and was a question to which the old valuation of the land was the proper answer A new clause therefore was necessary and the clause that was added points out so precisely the revaluation authorized by this indenture as to afford real evidence that the clause must have been contrived soon after it The clause as altered runs thus  Et quantum nunc valent dictae terrae et quantum valuerunt tempore pacis  It was extremely natural to characterize the old extent by the phrase  tempore pacis  not only as made in a peaceable reign but also in opposition to the new extent occasioned by the devastation of war I need only further remark that this new clause behoved to be ingrossed in every brieve because with respect to any particular landestate it could not beforehand be known whether it had been wasted by war or not  BUT besides conjecture there are facts which will put this matter beyond controversy I have not hitherto discovered a retour of land held of the King so ancient as the but of that period there are preserved authentick copies of many retours of lands held of bishops monasteries c who had the privilege of a chancery And we have no reason to doubt that the great barons who had this privilege were ambitious of copying after the King's chancery in every article The first retour I shall mention happens to be a very lucky authority for it verifies a fact which I have mentioned above upon the faith of conjecture that at the date of the indenture there was but one extent mentioned in the brieve and retour The retour I appeal to is that of the land of Orroc in the county of Fife held of the abbay of Dunfermline dated the th May the  valent  clause of which runs thus  Item dicunt quod praedictae terrae de Orroc valent per annum    l  This retour at the same  time shows that the alteration in the  valent  clause was not then introduced which is not wonderful when the retour is but a year and ten months after the indenture  SINCE writing what is above I have seen a copy not properly speaking of a retour but of a valuation of the lands of Kilravock and EasterGedies  anno  in which the  valent  clause runs thus  "Quod terra de Kilravock cum omnibus pertinentiis suis sciz cum molendinis bracinis quarellis et bosco valet per annum lib item dixerunt quod terra de EasterGedies cum molendino et bracinis valet per annum lib"  The most ancient retour I have seen after that now mentioned bears date in the being of land held of the same abbay Before this time probably several years the alteration of the  valent  clause was made for in this retour it runs thus  Et dictae terrae valebant tempore bonae pacis L    et nunc valent L  There are in that period many other retours mentioning two extents distinguishing them in the same manner And uniformly the  valuerunt tempore pacis  is greater than the  nunc valent  which puts it past doubt that the  nunc valent  refers to the  new extent authorized by the said indenture Some retours indeed there are of that period where the  valuerunt tempore pacis  and the  nunc valent  are the same But it is easy to account for that circumstance because from the indenture it appears that but a part of our lands were wasted by war and the retours now mentioned must be of lands which were not so wasted  DOWN to the days of our James I I take it to be certain that the two extents mentioned in retours were these of Alexander III and Robert Bruce In James's reign we observe an alteration which cannot be explained without going on with the history of the publick taxes The next tax that deserves to be taken notice of was in the reign of David II This King was taken prisoner by the English at the battle of Durham  anno  and was released  anno  after agreeing to pay for his ransom  l  Sterling within  the space of twenty five years And there is good evidence that the whole was paid before the year  Rymer vol VI p vol VII p  This immense debt contracted for redeeming the King from captivity came to be a burden upon his vassals by the very constitution of the feudal law abstracting from the authority of parliament It must therefore have been levied as a publick tax which appears to be the case from the rolls of that King still extant in exchequer And as there is no vestige of any new valuation at this time the old extent  viz  that of Alexander III must have been the rule except so far as it was altered by the partial valuation in the reign of Robert I And what puts this past doubt is that the new extent continued to be lower than the old extent or extent  tempore pacis  during this King's reign and until the reign of James I  JAMES I having been many years detained in England obtained his liberty  upon giving hostages for payment of  l  Sterling demanded under the specious title of alimony Of this sum  l  was remitted by Henry VI at that time King of England upon James's marrying a daughter of the duke of Somerset In the parliament provision was made for redeeming the hostages by a subsidy granted of the twentieth part of lands moveables c  Black acts p C  In order to levy this tax a valuation was directed of lands as well as of moveables And this new valuation of lands became proper if not necessary upon the following account that the reason for making the new extent in the no longer subsisted The lands which at that time had been wasted by war were now restored to their wonted value and yet without a new valuation these lands could only be taxed according to the extent And with this special reason concurred one more general which is than an extent if the commerce of  land be free cannot long be a rule for levying publick taxes For by succession purchase and other means of acquiring property parcels of land are united into a a whole or a whole split into parcels which acquire new names till by course of time it comes to be a matter of uncertainty what lands are meant by the original name preserved upon record This reason shows the necessity of new extents from time to time for after the connection betwixt land and the name it bears in the extent rolls is lost these rolls can no longer be of use for proportioning a tax upon such land  IT was appointed by the act imposing the subsidy that this extent should be made and put in books betwixt and the th July then next and that it was made and also that the subsidy was levied appears from the continuator of Fordon  L cap  He reports that it amounted the first year  to merks that the second year it was much less and the people beginning to murmur that the tax was no longer continued But we have still a better authority than the continuator of Fordon to prove that the extent was made  viz  several retours recently after the where the new extent is uniformly greater than the old extent or extent  tempore pacis  These must refer to some late extent and not to the extent which behoved to be less than the old extent Of these retours the most ancient I have met with is dated being of the lands of Blairmukis held of the Baron of Bothvill in which James de Dundas is retoured heir to James de Dundas his father  "Qui jurati dicunt quod dictae terrae nunc valent per annum mercas et valuerunt tempore pacis solidos  NB THIS retour is in the hands of Sir John Inglis of Cramond  "  SINCE there was a new extent of the whole lands of Scotland which must have  been the rule for levying the casualties of superiority as well as the tax then imposed one is naturally led to enquire what was the use of continuing in the brieve of inquest the  quoere  about the two different extents why not return to the ancient form specifying one extent only  viz  the present extent In answer to this it must be yielded that there could ly no objection to this innovation had it been intended But by this time the rule had prevailed of preserving inviolably the stile of judicial writs and as to questions so easy to be answered the innovation probably was reckoned a matter of no such importance as to occasion an alteration in the stile of the brieve of inquest One thing is certain that the stile remains the same without any alteration since the days of King Robert I The brieve and retour obtained however a different meaning so far as that the  nunc valent  by which formerly was meant the extent came afterwards to mean the extent For instance the retour  of the lands of Tullach held of the abbey of Aberbrothick bearing date has the  valent  clause thus  Valent per annum L    et tempore pacis valuerunt L  Another instance is a retour of the lands of Forglen held of the same abbey dated  Valent nunc per annum    merks et valuerunt tempore pacis L  That by the  nunc valent  in these two retours must be meant the late extent of James I is evident from the following circumstance that instead of being less than the extent  tempore pacis  which the extent constantly was it is considerably greater  As the extent was uniformly ingrossed in every retour in answer to the  quantum nunc valent  in the brieve this practice came to be exceeding favourable to vassals in counting for the casualties due by them because in every such account this extent was taken for the true rent of the land By the gradual sinking of the value of money and the improvement of  land the benefit which vassals had by this form of stating accounts came to be too considerable to be overlooked The value of the King's casualties by this means gradually diminishing the matter was taken under consideration by the legislature and produced the act p ordaining  "That it be answered in the retour of what avail the land was of old and the very avail that it is worth and gives the day of serving the brieve"  I formerly inclined to think that it was not the meaning of this statute to require a new proof of the rent of land every time it was retoured upon a brieve of inquest I suspected that there had been some new general valuation of the lands in Scotland recently before the statute and that the statute referred to this valuation And I was encouraged to embrace this opinion by finding in the records of parliament  acts  a tax imposed of  L  for defraying  the expence of an embassy to Denmark and a general valuation appointed in order to levy that tax Commissioners are named to take the proof and certain persons appointed one out of each estate to receive the sums that should be levied And that this must have been the case appeared probable upon finding that the new extent even after this period was not less uniform than formerly and therefore that it could not correspond to the true rent of land which all the world know is in a continual fluctuation But if after all there ensued no new valuation of the landrent of this kingdom of which there is not the slightest vestige the statute must be taken in its literal meaning because it can admit of none other I have still better authority for adhering to the literal meaning of this statute  viz  the proceedings of the sovereign court while the statute was fresh in memory The Earl of Bothwell donator to the relief and nonentry of the barony of Balinbreich brought a reduction against  the Earl of Rothes proprietor of his retour of that barony upon this medium that they were retoured to merks only for the new extent though the rent really amounted to a much greater sum It was proved before the court that the barony paid merks of rent and upon this medium the retour was reduced  d October  And the like was done with respect to the retour of the lands of Shield and Drongan which were retoured to  L  of new extent and yet were proved by witnesses to be merks of yearly rent  th February The King  contra  Crawford    IN the retours accordingly that bear date recently after the statute we find a sudden start of the new extent and a much greater disproportion than formerly betwixt it and the old extent In the chartulary of the abbey of Aberbrothick there is a copy of a retour of certain lands dated  anno  the particulars of which are  Terrae de Pittarrow  valent nunc L    tempore pacis L    Terrae de Cardinbegy valent nunc L    et tempore pacis L    Terrae de Auchingarth valent nunc    merks tempore pacis    merks  In the chartulary of the abbey of Dunfermline there is a copy of a retour of the lands of Clunys held of that abbey bearing date  anno    Valent nunc    merks et tempore pacis L  I have had occasion to mention a retour of the lands of Forglen held of the abbey of Aberbrothick dated  anno  of which the new extent is merks and the old extent is  L  In the same chartulary there is luckily another retour of the same lands bearing date  anno  of which the  valent  clause is in the following words  Valent nunc L    et valuerunt tempore pacis    merks  The difference in so short a time as years betwixt merks and  L  of new extent is real evidence that the act of parliament was duly observed in making out the retour lastmentioned But from the comparison of these two retours a more curious observation occurs  viz  that retours of lands held of subjectsuperiors are not much to be relied on as evidence of the old extent In the first of these retours the old extent is stated at  L  in the other at merks occasioned by a blunder of the inquest who ingrossed as the old extent in the retour they were forming the new extent contained in the former retour Many such blunders would probably be discovered had we a full record of old retours And it need not be surprising that in such retours little attention was given to the  valent  clause which was reckoned a matter merely of form For though the publick taxes were levied from the King's vassals according to the old extent yet in proportioning the relief which a Baron had against his own vassals there is little doubt that the true rent was made the rule The new extent was of more consequence because it was the rule for the nonentry duties before a declarator of nonentry was raised by a Baron against the heir of his vassal  IT may be remarked here by the by that the act is real evidence of a flourishing state of affairs after our James I got possession of his throne From the valuation to the said act there passed but fifty years and the land rent of Scotland must have increased remarkably during that period to make the act necessary But that Monarch in his younger years was disciplined in the school of adversity During a tedious confinement of eighteen years he had sufficient leisure to study the arts of government and probably he made the best use of his time It is certain that before his reign we had no experience and scarce any notion of a regular government where the law bears sway and the people peaceably submit to the authority of law But to return to our subject  AS by the statute now mentioned the superior's casualties were raised to their highest pitch it was impracticable to support  them long at that height in opposition to the general bias of the nation in favour of Vassals The notion had been long ago broatched and was now firmly established that the vassal was proprietor and consequently that ward relief and nonentry were rigorous and severe casualties We have Spotswood's authority in his history of the church of Scotland that loud complaints were made against these casualties early in the reign of James IV But why at this period in particular for we do not find the same complaints afterwards at least they make no figure in the annals of more recent times The act we have been discoursing about affords a satisfactory answer These casualties in consequence of the statute were more rigorously exacted than formerly And we shall now proceed to show that they were very soon brought down to a moderate pitch notwithstanding the statute In serving a brieve of inquest it is certain the practice did not long continue of taking a  proof by witnesses of the true rent of the land The old method was revived of making a former extent the rule If the land was once retoured as prescribed by the statute the old and new extent ingrossed in that retour were continued in the following retours If there was no retour a proportion of the old and new extent of the whole barony was taken And where that was not to be had it was the method to ingross a new extent bearing a certain proportion to the old extent For the last we have Skene's authority  voce  Extent His words are  "The Lords of session esteem a merkland of old extent to four merkland of new extent"  And he cites a decision  viz  st March Kennedy  contra  Mackinnald which seems to import so much though but obscurely because the case is not distinctly stated The process being for the nonentry duties of a five merkland it is said to have been proved that the land payed of rent four merks for every one of the  said five merks and I must acknowledge that the manner of expression seems to point at some general rule rather than at a proof by witnesses If this be the meaning of the decision it is the first case I have observed where this deviation from the statute was authorized by the sovereign court and a notable deviation it was to take up with such an imaginary rule for ascertaining the rent of the land when the statute directed a proof by witnesses of the true rent But when the act came once to be neglected the court was more explicit in their judgments on this point In a case observed by Balfour Title of Brieves and Retours th July Queen's Advocate and Lord Drummond  contra  George Mushet a general rule is established directly in face of the statute which is that when lands pay farmvictual poultry c the inquest are not bound to take inquisition of the yearly rent nor to convert such casualties into money And the reason given is remarkable  viz  that the price of such casualties is so changeable that no certain or fixed sum can be ascertained This is a very bad reason upon the plan of the statute though it serves to show the sense of the nation which the statute had not eradicated that the new extent ought to be fixed and uniform as well as the old At the same time as the landrent in Scotland was generally paid in victual this decision was in effect a repeal of the statute of which we need not doubt that the proprietors whose rents were paid in money would take advantage And the act came in this manner to be so universally neglected that it was established as a matter of right that the new extent should always be lower than the true rent and for this we have the best authority The act p impowering the King to feu out his annexed property has the following clause  "Providing always that the saidis infeftments of feuferme be not maid within the just avail to the prejudice  and hurt of our sovereign Lord and his successoures That is to say within the dewtie to the quilkis the saidis landis are retoured or may be justly retoured for the new extent Quhilk new extent his hieris with advice forsaid declaires to be the just avail of the saidis lands for the quhilk the samen may be set in feufarm"  Here it is clearly supposed that the new extent is a favourable estimation of the rent and lower than what is truly paid for the land  N B  For the materials employed in this tract the author is indebted to Mr John Davidson clerk to the
