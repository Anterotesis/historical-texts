 THE MAID OF THE MILL A COMIC OPERA As it is Performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN The Music Compiled and the Words written By the AUTHOR of LOVE IN A VILLAGE  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY R BALDWIN T CASLON W GRIFFIN W NICOLL T LOWNDS and T BECKET MDCCLXV  TO His Royal Highness WILLIAM DUKE OF GLOUCESTER  May it please your Royal Highness  WHEN I presumed to solicit the honour of laying the subsequent trifle at your Royal Highness's feet it was not without a thorough consciousness of the little value of the offering I was going to make but I considered mean as it was it would serve as a testimony of my devotion and to a Prince happy in a love of the arts nothing could be unacceptable which bore the remotest analogy to them  How far the Comic Opera under proper regulations has a right to be acknowledged for a junior offspring of the Drama and as such become candidate for a share of public encouragement I shall not pretend to determine but if it can be rendered an agreeable amusement the English Theatre has never scrupled to adopt what was capable of pleasing there and though as a work of genius it is by no means to be set in competition with good Tragedies and Comedies it may I apprehend be permitted as an occasional relief to them without bringing either our taste or understanding into question  I need not inform your Royal Highness that in France where the stage has been cultivated with more care and success than in any other country this species of entertainment is received with very great applause nor is it thought any injury to Corneille and Moliere that the pieces of Anseaume and Favart meet with success  It is true among the French Comic Operas have very often the advantage of being extremely well written of which On ne S'avise jamais de tout Le Roy et le Fermier and some others are an instance nor would the best composition of the greatest master make a very contemptible poem pass on an audience I wish I could assert with truth that in this respect we fall nothing behind our neighbours and that what I here present to your Royal Highness might lay claim to some degree of merit even in the writing but though I cannot do this permit me to say I have attempted to render it a little interesting and not wholly undiverting as far as the music my principal care would give me leave  But I humbly beg your Royal Highness's pardon in applying to the connoisseur I forget that I am at the same time addressing a Great Prince indeed there is a subject on which I could dwell with the truest pleasure but I  am too well instructed in your Royal Highness's character to dare to offend you with a language which forms and custom too often impose upon princes a necessity of hearing I mean their own praise to those who are most deserving ever least welcome  I therefore subscribe myself With the profoundest respect May it please your Royal Highness Your Royal Highness's Most obedient Most devoted and Most humble servant THE AUTHOR  THE PREFACE  THERE is scarce a language in Europe in which there is not a play taken from our romance of Pamela in Italian and French particularly several writers of the first eminence have chosen it for the subject of different dramas  The little piece now ventured into the world owes its origin to the same source not only the general subject is drawn from Pamela but almost every circumstance in it The reader will immediately recollect the courtship of Parson Williamsthe Squire's jealousy and behaviour in consequence of it and the difficulty he had to prevail with himself to marry the girl notwithstanding his passion for herthe miller is a close copy of Goodman Andrews  Ralph is imagined from the wild son which he is mentioned to have had Theodosia from the young lady of quality with whom Mr B through his sister's persuasion is said to have been in treaty before his marriage with Pamelaeven the gipsies are borrowed from a trifling incident in the latter part of the work  In prosecuting this plan which he has varied from the original as far as he thought convenient the author has made simplicity his principal aim His scenes on account of the music which could not be perfect without such a mixture necessarily consist of serious and buffoon He knows grossness and insipidity lay in his way whether he has had art enough to avoid stumbling upon them the candid Public is left to determine  This Opera is entered at STATIONERS HALL and whoever presumes to Print the Songs or any Part of them will be prosecuted by the PROPRIETORS  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Lord Aimworth  Mr Mattocks  Sir Harry Sycamore  Mr Shuter  Mervin  Mr Baker  Fairfield  Mr Gibson  Giles  Mr Beard  Ralph  Mr Dibdin  WOMEN  Lady Sycamore  Mrs Pitt  Theodosia  Miss Hallam  Patty  Miss Brent  Fanny

other a barn where  FANNY  sits mending a net  GILES  appears at a distance in the mill  FAIRFIELD  and  RALPH  taking sacks from a cart  CHORUS  FREE from sorrow free from strife  Oh how blest the miller's life  Chearful working thro' the day  Still he laughs and sings away  Nought can vex him  Nought perplex him  While there's grist to make him gay  DUET  Let the great enjoy the blessings  By indulgent fortune sent  What can wealth can grandeur offer  More than plenty and content  Fairf  Well done well done 'tis a sure sign work goes on merrily when folks sing at it Stop the mill there and dost hear son Ralph hoist yon sacks of  flour upon this cart lad and drive it up to lord Aimworth's coming from London last night with strange company no doubt there are calls enough for it by this time  Ral  Ay Feyther whether or not there's no fear but you'll find enow for a body to do  Fairf  What dost mutter is't not a strange plague that thou can'st never go about any thing with a good will murrain take it what's come o'er the boy so then thou wilt not set a hand to what I have desired thee  Ral  Why don't you speak to Suster Pat to do something then I thought when she come home to us after my old lady's death she was to have been of some use in the house but instead of that she sits there all day reading outlandish books dressed like a fine madumasel and the never a word you says to she  Fairf  Sirrah don't speak so disrespectfully of thy sister thou will't ne'er have the tyth of her deserts  Ral  Why I'll read and write with her for what she dares and as for playing on the hapsicols I thinks her rich good mother might have learn'd her something more properer seeing she did not remember to leave her a legacy at last  Fairf  That's none of thy business Sirrah  Ral  A farmer's wife painting pictures and playing on the hapsicols why I'll be hanged now for all as old as she is if she knows any more about milking a cow than I do of sewing a petticoat  Fairf  Ralph thou hast been drinking this morning  Ral  Well if so be as I have its nothing out of your pocket nor mines niether  Fairf  Who has been giving thee liquor sirrah  Ral  Why it was winda gentleman guv'd me  Fairf  A gentleman  Ral  Yes a gentleman that's come piping hot from London he is below at the Cat and Bagpipes I cod he rides a choice bit of a nag I dares to say she'd fetch as good as forty pound at ever a fair in all England  Fairf  A figgs end for what she'd fetch mind thy business or by the lord Harry  Ral  Why I won't do another hands turn today now so that's flat  Fairf  Thou wilt not  Ral  Why no I won't so what argufies your putting yourself in a passion Feyther I've promis'd to go back to the gentleman and I don't know but what he's a lord too and mayhap he may do more for me than you thinks of  Fairf  Well son Ralph run thy gait but remember I tell thee thou wilt repent this untowardness  Ral  Why how shall I repent it Mayhap you'll turn me out of your service a match with all hearts I cod I don't care three brass pins  AIR  If that's all you want who the plague will be sorry  'Twere better by half to dig stones in a quarry  For my share I'm weary of what is got by't  S'flesh here's such a racket such scoulding and coiling  You're never content but when folks are a toiling  And drudging like horses from morning 'till night  You think I'm afraid but the diff'rence to shew you  First yonders your shovel your sacks too I throw you  Hence forward take care of your matters who will  They're welcome to slave for your wages that need 'em  Tol lol derol lol I have purchas'd my freedom  And never hereafter shall work at the mill  SCENE II  FAIRFIELD and PATTY  Fairf  Dear heart dear heart I protest this ungracious boy puts me quite beside myself Patty my dear come down into the yard a little and keep me companyand you thieves vagabonds gipsies out here 'tis you debauch my son  Patty  AIR  In love to pine and languish  Yet know your passion vain  To harbour heartfelt anguish  Yet fear to tell your pain  What pow'rs unrelenting  Severer ills inventing  Can sharpen pangs like these  Where days and nights tormenting  Yield not a moment's ease  Fairf  Well Patty Master Goodman my lord's steward has been with me just now and I find we are like to have great doings his lordship has brought down sir Harry Sycamore and his family and there is more company expected in a few days  Patty  I know sir Harry very well he is by marriage a distant relation of my lord's  Fairf  Pray what sort of a young body is the daughter there I think she us'd to be with you at the castle three or four summers ago when my young lord was out upon his travels  Patty  Oh very often she was a great favourite of my lady's pray father is she come down  Fairf  Why you know the report last night about my lord's going to be married by what I can learn she is and there is likely to be a nearer relationship between  the families e're long It seems his lordship was not over willing for the match but the friends on both sides in London pressed it so hard then there's a swinging fortune master Goodman tells me a matter of twenty or thirty thousand pounds  Patty  If it was a million father it would not be more than my lord Aimworth deserves I suppose the wedding will be celebrated here at the mansionhouse  Fairf  So it is thought as soon as things can be properly preparedAnd now Patty if I could but see thee a little merryCome bless thee pluck up thy spiritsTo be sure thou has sustained in the death of thy lady a heavy loss she was a parent to thee nay and better inasmuch as she took thee when thou wert but a babe and gave thee an education which thy natural parents could not afford to do  Patty  Ah dear father don't mention what perhaps has been my greatest misfortune  Fairf  Nay then Patty what's become of all thy sense that people talk so much about But I have something to say to thee which I would have thee consider seriouslyI believe I need not tell thee my child that a young maiden after she is marriageable especially if she has any thing about her to draw people's notice is liable to ill tongues and a many cross accidents so that the sooner she is out of harm's way the better  Patty  Undoubtedly father there are people enough who watch every opportunity to gratify their own malice but when a young woman's conduct is unblameable  Fairf  Why Patty there may be something in that but you know slander will leave spots where malice finds none I say then a young woman's best safeguard is a good husband Now there is our neighbour farmer Giles he is a sober honest industrious young fellow and one of the wealthiest in these parts he is greatly taken with thee and it is not the first time I have told thee I should be glad to have him for a soninlaw  Patty  And I have told you as often father I would submit myself entirely to your direction whatever you think proper for me is so  Fairf  Why that's spoken like a dutiful sensible girl get thee in then and leave me to manage it Perhaps our neighbour Giles is not a gentleman but what are the greatest part of our country gentlemen good for  Patty  Very true father The sentiments indeed have frequently little correspondence with the condition and it is according to them alone we ought to regulate our esteem  AIR  What are outward forms and shews  To an honest heart compar'd  Oft the rustic wanting those  Has the nobler portion shar'd  Oft we see the homely flow'r  Bearing at the hedge's side  Virtues of more sov'reign pow'r  Than the garden's gayest pride  SCENE III  FAIRFIELD GILES  Giles  Well master Fairfield you and Miss Pat have had a long discourse together did you tell her that I was come down  Fairf  No in truth friend Giles I did not even tell her I had sent for thee but I mentioned our affair at a distance and I think there is no fear but what it will go as agreeably of her side as we could wish  Giles  That's rightWell and when shall us You do know I have told you my mind often and often  Fairf  Farmer give us thy hand nobody doubts thy good will to me and my girl and you may take  my word I would rather give her to thee than another for I am main certain thou wilt make her a good husband  Giles  Thanks to your kind opinion master Fairfield if such be my hap I hope there will be no cause of complaint  Fairf  And I promise thee my daughter will make thee a choice wifeBut there is one thing to be consideredThou know'st friend Giles that I and all belongs to me have great obligations to lord Aimworth's family Patty in particular would be one of the most ungrateful wretches this day breathing if she was to do the smallest thing contrary to their consent and approbationI need not tell thee what she owes them  Giles  Nay nay 'tis well enough known to all the country she was the old lady's darling  Fairf  Well master Giles I'll assure thee she is not one whit less obliged to my lord himselfWhen his mother was taken off so suddenly and his affairs called him up to London if Patty would have remained at the castle she might have had the command of all or if she would have gone any where else he would have paid for her fixing let the cost be what it would  Giles  Why for that matter folks did not spare to say that my lord had a kind of a sneaking kindness for her himself and I remember at one time it was rise all about the neighbourhood that she was actually to be our lady  Fairf  Pho pho a pack of women's tales  Giles  Nay to be sure they'll say any thing  Fairf  My lord's a man of a better way of thinking friend Giles But this is neither here nor there to our businessHave you been at the castle yet  Giles  Who I bless your heart I did not hear a syllable of his lordship's being come down till your lad told me  Fairf  No why then I'll tell you what you shall do go up to my lord let him know you have a mind to  make a match with my daughter hear what he has to say to it and afterwards we will try if we can't settle matters  Giles  Go up to my lord Icod if that be all I'll do it with the biggest pleasure in life  Fairf  Suppose you were to go this morning  Giles  This minute an you will never fear me I warrant I shan't be sham'd facedbut where's Miss Pat might not one ax her how she do do  Fairf  Never spare it she's within there  Giles  I sees herodd rabbit it this hatch is locked nowMiss PatMiss Pattyshe makes believe not to hear me  Fairf  Well well never mind thou'lt come and eat a morsel of dinner with us  Giles  Nay but just to have a bit of joke with her at presentMiss Pat I saywon't you open the door  AIR  Hark 'tis I your own true lover  After walking three long miles  One kind look at least discover  Come and speak a word to Giles  You alone my heart I fix on  Ah you little cunning vixen  I can see your roguish smiles  Addslids my mind is so possest  'Till we're sped I shan't have rest  Only say the thing's a bargain  Here an you like it  Ready to strike it  There's at once an end of arguing  I'm hers she's mine  Thus we seal and thus we sign  SCENE IV  FAIRFIELD PATTY  Fairf  Get away and finish the business thou art going about I warrant we shan't disagreeSo this now is just as I would have itPatty child why woud'st not thou open the door for our neighbour Giles  Patty  Really Father I did not know what was the matter  Fairf  Well another time he'll be here again presently He's gone up to the castle Patty thou know'st it would not be right for us to do any thing without giving his lordship intelligence so I have sent the farmer to let him know that he is willing and we are willing and with his lordship's approbation  Patty  Oh dear fatherwhat are you going to say  Fairf  Nay child I would not have stirr'd a step for fifty pounds without advertising his lordship beforehand  Patty  But surely surely you have not done this rash this precipitate thing  Fairf  How rash how is it rash Patty I don't understand thee  Patty  Oh you have distress'd me beyond imaginationbut why wou'd you not give me notice speak to me first  Fairf  Why han't I spoken to thee an hundred times no Patty 'tis thou that would'st distress me and thou'lt break my heart  Patty  Dear father  Fairf  All I desire is to see thee well settled and now that I am likely to do so thou art not contented I am sure the farmer is as sightly a clever lad as any in the country and is not he as good as we  Patty  I don't say to the contrary father I know I have no higher pretensions and you have a right to dispose of me as you think proper  Fairf  Well then what harm was there in sending him to his lordship seeing one or other of us must have gone  Patty  'Tis very true father I am to blame pray forgive me  Fairf  Forgive thee lord help thee my child I am not angry with thee but quiet thyself Patty and thou'lt see all this will turn out for the best  SCENE V  PATTY  What will become of memy lord will certainly imagine this is done with my consent Well is he not himself going to be married to a lady suitable to him in rank suitable to him in fortune as this farmer is to me and under what pretence can I refuse the husband my father has found for me shall I say that I have dared to raise my inclinations above my condition and presumed to love where my duty taught me only gratitude and respect Alas who could live in the house with lord Aimworth see him converse with him and not love him I have this consolation however my folly is yet undiscover'd to any else how should I be ridiculed and despised nay would not my lord himself despise me especially if he knew that I have more than once construed his natural affability and politeness into sentiments as unworthy of him as mine are bold and extravagant Unexampled vanity did I possess any thing capable of attracting such a notice to what purpose could a man of his distinction cast his eyes on a girl poor meanly born and indebted for every thing to the illplaced bounty of his family  AIR  Ah why should fate pursuing  A wretched thing like me  Heap ruin thus on ruin  And add to misery  The griefs I languish'd under  In secret let me share  But this new stroke of thunder  Is more than I can bear  SCENE VI  Changes to a saloon in Lord  AIMWORTH  's house  Sir HARRY SYCAMORE THEODOSIA  Sir Har  Well but Theodosia child you are quite unreasonable  Theo  Pardon me papa it is not I am unreasonable when I gave way to my inclinations for Mr Mervin he did not seem less agreeable to you and my mama than he was acceptable to me It is therefore you have been unreasonable in first encouraging his addresses and afterwards forbidding him your house in order to bring me down here to force me on a gentleman  Sir Har  Force you Dossy what do you mean by the la I would not force you on the Czar of Muscovy  Theo  And yet papa what else can I call it for though lord Aimworth is extremely attentive and obliging I assure you he is by no means one of the most ardent of lovers  Sir Har  Ardent ah there it is you girls never think there is any love without kissing and hugging but you shou'd consider child my lord Aimworth is a polite man and has been abroad in France and Italy where these things are not the fashion I remember when I was on my travels among the madames and signoras we never saluted more than the tip of the ear  Theo  Really papa you have a very strange opinion of my delicacy I had no such stuff in my thoughts  Sir Har  Well come my poor Dossy I see you are chagrin'd but you know it is not my fault on the contrary I assure you I had always a great regard for young Mervin and should have been very glad  Theo  How then papa could you join in forcing me to write him that strange letter never to see me more or how indeed could I comply with your commands what must he think of me  Sir Har  Ay but hold Dossy your mama convinced me that he was not so proper a soninlaw for us as lord Aimworth  Theo  Convinced you ah my dear papa you were not convinced  Sir Har  What don't I know when I am convinced  Theo  Why no papa because your goodnature and easiness of temper is such that you pay more respect to the judgment of mama and less to your own than you ought to do  Sir Har  Well but Dossy don't you see how your mama loves me if my finger does but ach she's like a bewitched woman and if I was to die I don't believe she wou'd outlive the burying of me nay she has told me as much herself  Theo  Her fondness indeed is very extraordinary  Sir Har  Besides could you give up the prospect of being a countess and mistress of this fine place  Theo  Yes truly could I  AIR  With the man that I love was I destin'd to dwell  On a mountain a moor in a cot in a cell  Retreats the most barren most desert would be  More pleasing than courts or a palace to me  Let the vain and the venal in wedlock aspire  To what folly esteems and the vulgar admire  I yield them the bliss where their wishes are plac'd  Insensible creatures 'tis all they can taste  SCENE VII  SIR HARRY THEODOSIA LADY SYCAMORE  La Syc  Sir Harry where are you  Sir Har  Here my lamb  La Syc  I am just come from looking over his lordship's family jewels I protest they are prodigiously magnificentWell miss Sycamore you are a happy creature to have diamonds equipage title all the blessings of life poured thus upon you at once  Theo  Blessings Madam do you think then that I am such a wretch as to place my felicity in the possession of any such trumpery  La Syc  Upon my word miss you have a very disdainful manner of expressing yourself I believe there are very few young women of fashion who wou'd think any sacrifice they cou'd make too much for themdid you ever hear the like of her Sir Harry  Sir Har  Why my dear I have just been talking to her in the same strain but whatever she has got in her head she seems to think  La Syc  Oh I know very well what she has got in her head it is Mr Mervin her gentleman of Bucklersbury fye miss marry a cit where is your pride your vanity have you nothing of the person of distinction about you  Sir Har  Well but my lady you know I am a piece of a cit myself as I may say for my great grandfather was a dry salter  Theo  And yet Madam you condescended to marry my papa  La Syc  Well if I did miss I had but five thousand pounds to my portion and Sir Harry knows I was past eight and thirty before I would listen to him  Sir Har  Nay Dossy that's true your mama own'd eight and thirty before we were married but by the  la my dear you were a lovely angel and by candlelight nobody would have taken you for above five and twenty  La Syc  Sir Harry you remember the last time I was at my lord duke's  Sir Har  Yes my love it was the very day your little bitch Minxey pupt  La Syc  Well and what did the whole family say my lord John and my lord Thomas and my lady Duchess in particular cousin says her grace to me for she always calls me cousin  Sir Har  And me too her grace is exceedingly kindshe always calls me cousin  La Syc  In short they all said that this match if my prudence could bring it about was the most desireable in the universe and the other absolutely below our attentionA fellow that will have an estate got by selling mundungus and mollossus  Theo  Well but Madam be their quality ever so great I can't see what right my lord John and my lord Thomas have to direct my inclinations and I must tell you there is a much nearer relation of mine and one who has a better right to rule me that is my father who has a great regard for Mr Mervin and would consent to our union with all his heart  La Syc  Did you say so Sir Harry  Sir Har  Who I love  La Syc  Then all my care and prudence are come to nothing  Sir Har  Well but stay my ladyDossy you are always making mischief  Theo  Ah my dear sweet  La Syc  Do Miss that's right coax  Theo  No Madam I am not capable of any such meanness  La Syc  'Tis very civil of you to contradict me however  Sir Har  Eh what's thathands off Dossy don't come near me  AIR  Why how now Miss pert  Do you think to divert  My anger by fawning and stroking  Wou'd you make me a fool  Your play thing your tool  Was ever young minx so provoking  Get out of my sight  'Twould be serving you right  To lay a sound dose of the lash on  Contradict your Mama  I've a mind by the la  But I won't put myself in a passion  SCENE VIII  SIR HARRY LADY SYCAMORE LORD AIMWORTH GILES  L Aim

taken care to make a prudent choice  Giles  Why I do hope so my lord  L Aim  Well and who is the happy fair one does she live in my house  Giles  No my lord she does not live in your house but she's a parson of your acquaintance  L Aim  Of my acquaintance  Giles  No offence I hope your honour  L Aim  None in the least but how is she an acquaintance of mine  Giles  Your lordship do know Miller Fairfield  L Aim  Well  Giles  And Patty Fairfield his daughter my lord  L Aim  Ay is it her you think of marrying  Giles  Why if so be as your lordship has no objection to be sure we will do nothing without your consent and approbation  L Aim  Upon my word farmer you have made an excellent choiceIt is a goddaughter of my mother's Madam who was bred up under her care and I protest I do not know a more amiable young woman but are you sure farmer that Patty herself is inclinable to this match  Giles  O yes my lord I am sartain of that  L Aim  Perhaps then she desired you to come and ask my consent  Giles  Why as far as this here my lord to be sure the miller did not care to publish the banns without making your lordship acquainted But I hope your honor's not angry with I  L Aim  Angry farmer why should you think so what interest have I in it to be angry  Sir Har  And so honest farmer you are going to be married to little Patty Fairfieldher father's a good warm fellow I suppose you take care that she brings something to make the pot boil  La Syc  What does that concern you Sir Harry how often must I tell you of meddling in other people's affairs  Sir Har  My lord a penny for your thoughts  La Syc  I beg your pardon Sir Harry upon my word I did not think where I was  Giles  Well then your honour I'll make bold to be taking my leave I may say you gave consent for Miss Patty and I to go on  L Aim  Undoubtedly farmer if she approves of it but are not you afraid that her education has rendered her a little unsuitable for a wife for you  La Syc  Oh my lord if the girl's handy  Giles  Handy why saving respect there's nothing comes amiss to her she's cute at every varsal kind of thing  AIR  Odds my life search England over  An you match her in her station  I'll be

clear sighted  Sir Har  Yes yes let me alone I know what's what I was a young fellow once myself and I should have been glad of a tenant to take a pretty girl off my hands now and then as well as another  L Aim  I protest my dear friend I don't understand you  La Syc  Nor nobody else Sir Harry you are going at some beastliness now  Sir Har  Who I my lady not I as I hope to live and breath 'tis

lord you won't speak to himwill you come out Sir Harry  Sir Har  Nay but my lady  La Syc  No I will have you out  SCENE X  LORD AIMWORTH  This worthy baronet and his lady are certainly a very whimsical couple however their daughter is perfectly amiable in every respect and yet I am sorry I have brought her down here for can I in honour marry her while my affections are engaged to another To what does the pride of condition and the censure of the world force me Must I then renounce the only person that can make me happy because because what because she's a miller's daughter Vain pride and unjust censure has she not all the graces that education can give her sex improved by a genius seldom found among the highest Has she not modesty sweetness of temper and beauty of person capable of adorning a rank the most exalted But it is too late to think of these things now my hand is promised my honour engaged and if it was not so she has engaged herself the farmer is a person to her mind and I have authorised their union by my approbation  AIR  The mad man thus at times we see  With seeming reason blest  His looks his words his thoughts are free  And speak a mind at rest  But short the calms of ease and sense  And ah uncertain too  While that idea lives from whence  At first his frenzy grew  SCENE XI  Changes to a prospect of the mill  Enter  RALPH  with  MERVIN  in a riding dress followed by  FANNY  Fanny  Ah pray your honour try if you have not something to spare for poor Fanny the gypsey  Ralph  I tell you Fan the gentleman has no change about him why the plague will you be so troublesome  Fanny  Lord what is it to you if his honor has a mind to give me a trifle do pray gentleman put your hand in your pocket  Mervin  I am almost distracted ungrateful Theodosia to change so suddenly and write me such a letter however I am resolved to have my dismission face to face this letter may be forced from her by her mother who I know was never cordially my friend I could not get a sight of her in London but here they will be less on their guard and see her I will by one means or other  Fanny  Then your honour will not extend your charity  AIR  I am young and I am friendless  And poor alas withal  Sure my sorrows will be endless  In vain for help I call  Have some pity in your nature  To relieve a wretched creature  Though the gift be ne'er so small  May you possessing every blessing  Still inherit Sir all you merit Sir  And never know what it is to want  Sweet Heaven your worship all happiness grant  SCENE XII  RALPH MERVIN  Ral  Now I'll

to any ChristianI am in love with her  Mer  Indeed  Ral  Feyther is as mad with me about it as Old Scratch and I gets the plague and all of anger but I don't mind that  Mer  Well friend Ralph if you are in love no doubt you have some influence over your mistress don't you think now you could prevail upon her and her companions  to supply me with one of their habits and let me go up with them today to my lord Aimworth's  Ral  Why do you want to go a mumming we never do that here but in the Christmas holidays  Mer  No matter manage this for me and manage it with secrecy and I promise you shall not go unrewarded  Ral  Oh as for that sir I don't look for any thing I can easily get you a bundle of their rags but I don't know whether you'll prevail on them to go up to my lord's because they're afraid of a big dog that's in the yard but I'll tell you what I can do I can go up before you and have the dog fastened for I know his kennel  Mer  That will do very wellby means of this disguise I shall probably get a sight of her and I leave the rest to love and fortune  AIR  Why quits the merchant blest with ease  The pleasures of his native seat  To tempt the dangers of the seas  And climes more perilous than these  Midst freezing cold or scorching heat  He knows the hardships knows the pain  The length of way but thinks it small  The sweets of what he hopes to gain  Undaunted make him combat all  SCENE XIII  PATTY RALPH GILES FANNY  Giles  So his lordship was as willing as the flowers in Mayand as I was coming along who shou'd I meet but your fatherand he bid me run in all haste and tell youfor we were sure you wou'd be deadly glad  Patty  I know not what business you had to go to my lord's at all farmer  Giles  Nay I only did as I was desiredMaster Fairfield bid me tell you moreover as how he wou'd have you go up to my lord out of hand and thank him  Ral  So she ought and take off those cloaths and put on what's more becoming her station you know my father spoke to you of that this morning too  Patty  Brother I shall obey my father  Lye still my heart oh fatal stroke  That kills at once my hopes and me  Giles  Miss Pat  Patty  what  Giles  Nay I only spoke  Ralph  Take courage mon she does but joke  Come Suster somewhat kinder be  Fanny  This is a thing the most oddest  Some folks are so plaguily modest  Ral Fan  Were we in the case  To be in their place  We'd carry it off with a different face  Giles  Thus I take her by the lilly hand  So soft and white  Ral  why now that's right  And kiss her too mon never stand  Pat Giles  What words can explain  My pleasuremy pain  It presses it rises  My heart it surprises  I can't keep it down tho' I'd never so fain  Fan  So here the play ends  The lovers are friends  Ral  Hush  Fan  Tush  Giles  Nah  Patty  Psha  All  What torment's exceeding what joys are above  The pains and the pleasures that wait upon love  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A marble portico ornamented with statues which opens from Lord  AIMWORTH  's house two chairs near the front  Enter Lord  AIMWORTH  reading  IN how contemptible a light would the situation I am now in shew me to most of the fine men of the present age in love with a country girl rivaled by a poor fellow one of my meanest tenants and uneasy at it if I had a mind to her I know they would tell me I ought to have taken care to make myself easy long ago when I had her in my power But I have the testimony of my own heart in my favour and I think was it to do again I should act as I have done Let's see what have we here perhaps a book may compose my thoughts  reads and throws the book away  it's to no purpose I can't read I can't think I can't do any thing  AIR  Ah how vainly mortals treasure  Hopes of happiness and pleasure  Hard and doubtful to obtain  By what standards false we measure  Still pursuing  Ways to ruin  Seeking bliss and finding pain  SCENE II  Lord AIMWORTH PATTY  Patty  Now comes the trial no my sentence is already pronounc'd and I will meet my fate with prudence and resolution  L Aim  Who's there  Patty  My lord  L Aim  Patty Fairfield  Patty  I humbly beg pardon my lord for pressing so abruptly into your presence but I was told I might walk this way and I am come by my father's commands to thank your lordship for all your favours  L Aim  Favours Patty what favours I have done you none but why this metamorphosis I protest if you had not spoke I should not have known you I never saw you wear such cloaths as these in my mother's life time  Patty  No my lord it was her ladyship's pleasure I should wear better and therefore I obey'd but it is now my duty to dress in a manner more suitable to my station and future prospects in life  L Aim  I am afraid Patty you are too humble come sit downnay I will have it sowhat is it I have been told to day Patty it seems you are going to be married  Patty  Yes my lord  L Aim  Well and don't you think you could have made a better choice than farmer Giles I should imagine your person your accomplishments might have intitled you to look higher  Patty  Your lordship is pleased to overrate my little merit the education I received in your family does not intitle me to forget my origin and the farmer is my equal  L Aim  In what respect the degrees of rank and fortune my dear Patty are arbitrary distinctions unworthy the regard of those who consider justly the true  standard of equality is seated in the mind those who think nobly are noble  Patty  The farmer my lord is a very honest man  L Aim  So he may I don't suppose he would break into a house or commit a robbery on the highway what do you tell me of his honesty for  Patty  I did not mean to offend your lordship  L Aim  Offend I am not offended Patty not at all offendedbut is there any great merit in a man's being honest  Patty  I don't say there is my lord  L Aim  The farmer is an ill bred illiterate booby and what happiness can you propose to yourself in such a society Then as to his person I am sureBut perhaps Patty you like him and if so I am doing a wrong thing  Patty  Upon my word my lord  L Aim  Nay I see you do he has had the good fortune to please you and in that case you are certainly in the right to follow your inclinationsI must tell you one thing Patty howeverI hope you won't think it unfriendly of meBut I am determined farmer Giles shall not stay a moment on my estate after next quarter day  Patty  I hope my lord he has not incurred your displeasure  L Aim  That's of no significationCould I find as many good qualities in him as you do perhapsbut 'tis enough he's a fellow I don't like and as you have a regard for him I would have you advise him to provide himself  Patty  My lord I am very unfortunate  L Aim  She loves him 'tis plainCome Patty don't cry I would not willingly do any thing to make you uneasyHave you seen Miss Sycamore yet I suppose you know she and I are going to be married  Patty  So I hear my lord Heaven make you both happy  L Aim  Thank you Patty I hope we shall be happy  Patty  Upon my knees upon my knees I pray it may every earthly bliss attend you may your days prove an uninterrupted course of delightful tranquility and your mutual friendship confidence and love end but with your lives  L Aim  Rise Patty rise say no moreI suppose you'll wait upon Miss Sycamore before you go awayat present I have a little businessas I said Patty don't afflict yourself I have been somewhat hasty with regard to the farmer but since I see how deeply you are interested in his affairs I may possibly alter my designs with regard to himYou knowyou know Patty your marriage with him is no concern of mineI only speak  AIR  My passion in vain I attempt to dissemble  Th' endeavour to hide it but makes it appear  Enraptur'd I gaze when I touch her I tremble  And speak to and hear her with fault'ring and fear  By how many cruel ideas tormented  My blood's in a ferment it freezes it burns  This moment I wish what the next is repented  While love rage and jealousy rack me by turns  SCENE III  PATTY GILES  Giles  Miss PatOdd rabit it I thought his honour was here and I wish I may die if my heart did not jump into my mouthcome come down in all haste there's such rig below as you never knew in your born days  Patty  Rig  Giles  Ay and funthere's as good as forty of the tenants men and maidens have got upon the lawn before the castle with pipers and garlands just for all the world as thof it was May day and the quality's looking at them out of the windows'Tis as true as any thing on account of my lord's coming home with his new ladylook here I have brought a string of their flowers along with me  Patty  Well and what then  Giles  Why I was thinking if so be as you would come down as we might take a dance together little Sal farmer Harrow's daughter of the Green would fain have had me for a partner but I said as how I'd go for one I liked better one that I'd make a partner for life  Patty  Did you say so  Giles  Yes and she was struck all of a heapshe had not a word to throw to a dogfor Sal and I kept company once for a little bit  Patty  Farmer I am going to say something to you and I desire you will listen to it attentivelyit seems you think of our being married together  Giles  Think why I think of nothing else it's all over the place mun as how you are to be my spouse and you wou'd not believe what game folks make of me  Patty  Shall I talk to you like a friend farmer you and I were never design'd for one another and I am morally certain we should not be happy  Giles  Oh as for that matter I never has no words with no body  Patty  Shall I speak plainer to to you thenI don't like you  Giles  No  Patty  On the contrary you are disagreeable to me  Giles  Am I  Patty  Yes of all things I deal with you sincerely  Giles  Why I thought Miss Pat the affair between you and I was all fix'd and settled  Patty  Well let this undeceive youBe assured we shall never be man and wife No offer shall persuade no command force meyou know my mind make your advantage of it  AIR  Was I sure a life to lead  Wretched as the vilest slave  Ev'ry hardship wou'd I brave  Rudest toil severest need  'Ere yield my hand so cooly  To the man who never truly  Could my heart in keeping have  Wealth with others success will insure you  Where your wit and your person may please  Take to them your love I conjure you  And in mercy set me at ease  SCENE IV  GILES  Here's a turn I don't know what to make of it she's gone mad that's for sartin wit and learning have crakt her brainpoor soul poor soulIt is often the case of those that have too much of them Lord Lord how sorry I bebut hold she says I baint to her mindmayn't all this be the effect of modish coyness to do like the gentlewomen because she was bred among them and I have heard say they will be upon their vixen tricks 'till they go into the very church with a man Icod there's nothing more likelier for 'tis the cry of one and all that she's the moral of a lady in every thing and our farmers daughters for the matter of that tho'f they have nothing to boast of but a scrap of red ribbon about their hats will have as many turnings and windings as a hare before one can lay a fast hold of them There can no harm come of speaking with master Fairfield howsoever odd rabbit it how plaguy tart she wasI am half vext with my myself now that I let her go off so  AIR  When a maid in way of marriage  First is courted by a man  Let 'un do the best he can  She's so shamefac'd in her carriage  'Tis with pain the suit's began  Tho'f mayhap she likes him mainly  Still she shams it coy and cold  Fearing to confess it plainly  Lest the folks should think her bold  But the parson comes in sight  Gives the word to bill and coo  'Tis a different story quite  And she quickly buckles too  SCENE V  Changes to a view of Lord  AIMWORTH's  house and improvements a seat under a tree and part of the garden wall with a Chinese pavilion over it several country people appear dancing others looking on among whom are  MERVIN  disguised  RALPH FANNY  and a number of gypsies After the dancers go off  THEODOSIA  and  PATTY  enter through a gate supposed to have a connection with the principal building  Theo  Well then my dear Patty you will run away from us but why in such a hurry I have a thousand things to say to you  Pat  I shall do myself the honour to pay my duty to you some other time Madam at present I really find myself a little indisposed  Theo  Nay I would by no means lay you under any restraint But methinks the entertainment we have just been taking part of should have put you into better spirits I am not in an overmerry mood myself yet I swear I could not look on the diversion of those honest folks without feeling a certain  gaietie de coeur    Pat  Why indeed Madam it had one circumstance attending it which is often wanting to more polite amusements that of seeming to give undissembled satisfaction to those who were engaged in it  Theo  Oh infinite infinite to see the chearful healthy looking creatures toil with such a good will to me there were more genuine charms in their awkward stumping and jumping about their rude measures and homespun finery than in all the dress splendor and studied graces of a birthnight ballroom  Pat  'Tis a very uncommon declaration to be made by a fine lady Madam but certainly however the artful delicacies of high life may dazzle and surprise nature has particular attractions even in a cottage her most  unadorned state which seldom fails to affect us tho' we can scarce give a reason for it  Theo  But you know Patty I was always a distracted admirer of the country no damsel in romance was ever fonder of groves and purling streams had I been born in the days of Arcadia with my present propensity instead of being a fine lady as you call me I should certainly have kept a flock of sheep  Patty  Well madam you have the sages poets and philosophers of all ages to countenance your way of thinking  Theo  And you my little philosophical friend don't you think me in the right too  Patty  Yes indeed madam perfectly  AIR  Trust me would you taste true pleasure  Without mixture without measure  No where shall you find the treasure  Sure as in the sylvan scene  Blest who no false glare requiring  Nature's rural sweets admiring  Can from grosser joys retiring  Seek the simple and serene  SCENE VI  THEODOSIA MERVIN FANNY  Theo  How unjust is fortune in the distribution of her gifts This girl certainly merits to shine in a higher sphere and how many that pass for fine ladies might fill the place she now occupies without the least violence to their characters  Mer  Yonder she is seated and to my wish most fortunately alone Accost her as I desired  Theo  Heigh  Sighing  I could be very melancholly now but that indeed is no wonder in my present situation  Fan  Heaven bless you my sweet ladybless your honour's beautiful visage and send you a good husband and a great many of them  Theo  A very comfortable wish upon my word who are you child  Fan  A poor gipsey an' please you that goes about begging from charitable gentlemen and ladiesIf you have ere a coal or bit of whiting in your pocket I'll write you the first letter of your sweetheart's name how many husbands you will have and how many children my lady or if you will let me look at your line of life I'll tell you whether it will be long or short happy or miserable  Theo  Oh as for that I know it alreadymy life will be miserable most certainly and as you cannot tell me any good fortune I'll hear none Go about your business  Mer  Stay madam stay  Pretending to lift a paper from the ground  you have dropt something Fan call the young gentlewoman back  Fan  Lady you have lost  Theo  Pho pho I have lost nothing  Mer  Yes that paper lady you dropt it as you got up from the chair we are poor but honest Fan give it to her honour  Theo  A letter with my address  Takes the paper and reads  "Dear Theodosia Though the sight of me was so disagreeable to you that you charged me never to approach you more I hope my handwriting can have nothing to frighten or disgust you I am not far off and the person who delivers you this can give you intelligence"  Come hither child Do you know any thing of the gentleman that wrote this  Fán  My lady  Theo  Make haste run this moment bring me to him bring him to me say I wait with impatience tell him I will go fly any where  Mer  My life my charmer  Theo  Oh HeavensMr Mervin  SCENE VII  THEODOSIA MERVIN SIR HARRY LADY SYCAMORE FANNY GIPSIES  La Syc  Sir Harry

have broken victuals If we were at home indeed perhaps you might get some such thing from the cook but here we are only on a visit to a friend's house and have nothing to do with the kitchen at all  La Syc  And do you think Sir Harry it is necessary to give the creature an account  Sir Har  No love no but what can you say to obstinate peopleGet you gone bold faceI once knew a merchant's wife in

Don't be frighten'd my lady let me advance  AIR  You vile pack of vagabonds what do ye mean  I'll maul you rascallions  Ye tatter demallions  If one of them comes within reach of my cane  Such cursed assurance  'Tis past all endurance  Nay nay pray come away  They're lyars and thieves  And he that believes  Their foolish predictions  Will find them but fictions  A bubble that always deceives  SCENE VIII  MERVIN THEODOSIA FANNY GIPSIES  Fanny  Oh mercy dearThe gentleman is so bold 'tis well if he does not bring us into trouble Who knows but this may be a justice of peace and see he's following them into the garden    st Gipsey    Well 'tis all your seeking Fan  Fan  We shall have warrants to take us up I'll be hang'd else We had better run away the servants will come out with

would you have me give you I know but of one if you please I am willing to go off with you  Mer  Are you Would to Heaven I had brought a carriage  Theo  How did you come Have you not horses  Mer  No there's another misfortune to avoid suspicion there being but one little publichouse in the village I dispatched my servant with them about an hour ago to wait for me at a town twelve miles distant whither I pretended to go also but alighting a mile off I equipt myself and came back as you see neither can we nearer than this town get a postchaise  Theo  You say you have made a confidant of the miller's son return to your place of rendezvous my father has been asked this moment by Lord Aimworth who is in the garden to take a walk with him down to the mill they will go before dinner and it shall be hard if I cannot contrive to be one of the company  Mer  And what then  Theo  Why in the mean time you may devise some method to carry me from hence and I'll take care you shall have an

don't take on about it belike Miss Pat has another love and if so in Heaven's name be't what's one man's meat as the saying is is another man's poison And thof some might find me well enough to their fancy set in case I don't suit her's why there's no harm done  Fairf  Well but neighbour I have put that to her and the story is she has no inclination to marry any one all she desires is to stay at

have had one half of what I was worth to the uttermost farthing  Giles  Why to be sure Master Fairfield I am not the less obligated to your goodwill but as to that matter had I married it should not have been for the lucre of gain but if I do like a girl do you see I do like her ay and I'll take her saving respect if she had not a second petticoat  Fairf  Well saidwhere love is with a little industry what have a young couple to be afraid of and by the lord Harry for all that's past I cannot help thinking we shall bring our matters to bear yetYoung women you know friend Giles  Giles  Why

able to profit of your kind intentions unless you will condescend to speak a little to Patty  L Aim  How speak  Fair  Why my lord I thought we had pretty well ordered all things concerning this marriage but all on a sudden the girl has taken it into her head not to have the farmer and declares she will never marry at allbut I know my lord she'll pay great respect to any thing you say and if you'll but lay your commands on her to marry him I am sure she'll do it  L Aim  Who I lay my commands on her  Fair  Yes pray my lord do I'll send her into you  L Aim  Master Fairfield  Fairfield goes out and returns  What can be the meaning of this refuse to marry the farmer How why My heart is thrown in an agitation while every step I take serves but to lead me into new perplexities  Fair  She's coming my lord I said you were here and I humbly beg you will tell her you insist upon the match going forward tell her you insist upon it my lord and speak a little angrily to her  SCENE XIV  Lord  AIMWORTH PATTY  Pat  Yet another conflict well 'tis the last and I must go through it  L Aim  I came hither Patty in consequence of our conversation this morning to render your change of state as agreeable and happy as I could but your father tells me you have fallen out with the farmer has any thing happened since I saw you last to alter your good opinion of him  Pat  No my lord I am in the same opinion with regard to the farmer now that I always was  L Aim  I thought Patty you loved him you told me  Pat  My lord  L Aim  Well no matterIt seems I have been mistaken in that particularPossibly your affections are engaged elsewhere let me but know the man that can make you happy and I swear  Pat  Indeed my lord you take too much trouble upon my account  L Aim  Perhaps Patty you love somebody so much beneath you you are ashamed to own it but your esteem confers a value wheresoever it is placedI was too harsh with you this morning our inclinations are not in our own power they master the wisest of us  Pat  Pray pray my lord talk not to me in this stile consider me as one destined by birth and fortune to the meanest condition and offices who has unhappily been too apt to imbibe sentiments contrary to them let me conquer a heart where pride and vanity have usurped an improper rule and learn to know myself of whom I have been too long ignorant  L Aim  Perhaps Patty you love some one so much above you you are afraid to own itIf so be his rank what it will he is to be envied for the love of a woman of virtue beauty and sentiment does  honour to a monarch What means that downcast look those tears those blushes Dare you not confide in meDo you think Patty you have a friend in the world would sympathize with you more sincerely than I  Pat  What shall I answer No my lord you have ever treated me with a kindness a generosity of which none but minds like your's are capable you have been my instructor my adviser my protector but my lord you have been too good when our superiors forget the distance between us we are sometimes led to forget it too had you been less condescending perhaps I had been happier  L Aim  And have I Patty have I made you unhappy I who would sacrifice my own felicity to secure yours  Pat  I beg my lord you will suffer me to be gone only believe me sensible of all your favours tho' unworthy of the smallest  L Aim  How unworthy you merit every thing my respect my esteem my friendship and my love yes I repeat I avow it your beauty your modesty your understanding has made a conquest of my heart but what a world do we live in that while I own this while I own a passion for you founded on the justest the noblest basis I must at the same time confess the fear of that world its taunts its reproaches  Pat  Ah Sir think better of the creature you have raised than to suppose I ever entertained a hope tending to your dishonour would that be a return for the favours I have received would that be a grateful reverence for the memory of herpity and pardon the disturbance of a mind that fears to enquire too minutely into its own sensationsI am unfortunate my lord but not criminal  L Aim  Patty we are both unfortunate for my own part I know not what to say to you or what to propose to myself  Pat  Then my lord 'tis mine to act as I ought yet while I am honoured with a place in your esteem  imagine me not insensible of so high a distinction or capable of lightly turning my thoughts towards another  L Aim  How cruel is my situation I am here Patty to command you to marry the man who has given us so much uneasiness  Pat  My lord I am convinced it is for your credit and my safety it should be so I hope I have not so ill profited by the lessons of your noble mother but I shall be able to do my duty wherever I am call'd to it this will be my first support time and reflection will compleat the work  AIR  Cease oh cease to overwhelm me  With excess of bounty rare  What am I what have I tell me  To deserve your meanest care  'Gainst our fate in vain's resistance  Let me then no grief disclose  But resign'd at humble distance  Offer vows for your repose  SCENE XV  Lord  AIMWORTH PATTY  Sir  HARRY SYCAMORE THEODOSIA GILES  Sir Har  No justice of peace no bailiffs no headborough Why gypsies are as great a nusance in this country as rats were in the island where Wittington went to  L Aim  What's the matter Sir Harry  Sir Har  The matter my lord while I was examining the construction of the mill without for I have some small notion of mechanics Miss Sycamore had like to have been run away with by a gypsey man  Theo  Dear papa how can you talk so did not I tell you it was at my own desire the poor fellow went to shew me the canal  Sir Har  Hold your tongue Miss Sycamore I understand what I am saying I don't know any business you had to let him come near you at all we have stayed so long too your Mama gave us but half an hour and she'll be frightened out of her wits she'll think some accident has happened to me  L Aim  I'll wait upon you when you please  Sir Har  O but my lord here's a poor fellow tells us a dismal storyit seems his mistress has conceived some disgust against him pray has her father spoke to you to interpose your authority in his behalf  Giles  If his lordship's honour would be so kind I would acknowledge the favour as far as in me lay  Sir Har  Hold your tongue let me speak did not the miller tell you he had given you a thousand pounds portion  takes lord Aimworth aside  a word or two in your lordship's ear  Theo  Well I do like this gypsey scheme prodigiously if we can but put it into execution as happily as we have contrived it  here Patty enters  so my dear  Patty  you see I am come to return your visit very soon but this is only a call  en passant  will you be at home after dinner  Patty  Certainly Madam whenever you condescend to honour me so far but it is what I cannot expect  Theo  O fye why notWell Patty I will positively see you in the evening  Pat  Then undoubtedly Madam I shall take care not to be out of the way  Giles  Your servant Miss Patty  Pat  Farmer your servant  Sir Har  Here you goodman delver I have done your business for you my lord has spoke and your fortune's made a thousand pounds at present and better things to come his lordship says he will be your friend  Giles  I do hope then Miss Pat will make all up  Sir Har  Miss Pat make up stand out of the way I'll make it up  The quarrels of lovers adds me they're a jest  Come hither ye blockhead come hither  So now let us leave them together  L Aim  Farewell then  Patty  For ever  Giles  I vow and protest  'Twas kind of his honour  To gain thus upon her  We're so much beholden it can't be exprest  Theo  I feel something here  'Twixt hoping and fear  Haste haste friendly night  To shelter our flight  Ld A Patty  A thousand distractions are rending my breast  Patty  Oh mercy  Giles  oh dear  Sir Har  Why Miss will you mind when you're spoke to or not  Must I stand in waiting  While you're here a prating  Ld A Theo  May ev'ry felicity fall to your lot  Giles  She curtsy's look there  What a shape what an air  All  How happy how wretched how tir'd am I  Your lordship's obedient your servant good by  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  The Lawn before Lord  AIMWORTH  's house  Enter Lord  AIMWORTH  Sir  HARRY  Lady  SYCAMORE  and  RALPH  L Syc  A Wretch a vile inconsiderate wretch coming of such a race as mine and having an example like me before her  L Aim  I beg madam you will not disquiet yourself you are told here that a gentleman lately arrived from London has been about the place today that he has disguis'd himself like a gipsey came hither and had some conversation with your daughter you are even told that there is a design formed for their going off tother but possibly there may be some mistake in all this  Sir Har  Ay but my lord the lad tells us the gentleman's name we have seen the gipsies and we know she has had a hankering  L Syc  Sir Harry my dear why will you put in your word when you hear others speakingI protest my lord I'm in such confusion I know not what to say I can hardly support myself  L Aim  This gentleman it seems is at a little inn at the bottom of the hill  Sir Har  I wish it was possible to have a file of musqueteers my lord I could head them myself being in the militia and we would go and seize him directly  L Aim  Softly my dear sir let us proceed with a little less violence in this matter I beseech you We  should first see the young ladyWhere is Miss Sycamore madam  L Syc  Really my lord I don't know I saw her go into the garden about a quarter of an hour ago from our chamber window  Sir Har  Into the garden perhaps she has got an inkling of our being informed of this affair and is gone to throw herself into the pond Despair my lord makes girls do terrible things 'Twas but the Wednesday before we left London that I saw taken out of Rosamond's pond in Saint James's Park as likely a young woman as ever you would desire to set your eyes on in a new calamancoe petticoat and a pair of silver buckles in her shoes  L Aim  I hope there is no danger of any such fatal accident happening at present but will you oblige me sir Harry  Sir Har  Surely my lord  L Aim  Will you commit the whole direction of this affair to my prudence  Sir Har  My dear you hear what his lordship says  L Syc  Indeed my lord I am so much asham'd I don't know what to answer the fault of my daughter  L Aim  Don't mention it madam the fault has been mine who have been innocently the occasion of a young lady's transgressing a point of duty and decorum which otherwise she would never have violated But if you and sir Harry will walk in and repose yourselves I hope to settle every thing to the general satisfaction  L Syc  Come in sir Harry  L Aim  I am sure my good friend had I known that I was doing a violence to Miss Sycamore's inclinations in the happiness I proposed to myself  Sir Har  My lord 'tis all a caseMy grandfather by the mother's side was a very sensible manhe was elected knight of the shire in five successive parliaments and died high sheriff of his countya man of fine parts fine talents and the curioest docker of horses in all  England but that he did only now and then for his amusement And he used to say my lord that the female sex were good for nothing but to bring forth children and breed disturbance  L Aim  The ladies were very little oblig'd to your ancestor sir Harry but for my part I have a more favourable opinion  Sir Har  You are in the wrong my lord with submission you are really in the wrong  AIR  To speak my mind of womankind  In one word 'tis this  By nature they're design'd  To say and do amiss  Be they maids be they wives  Alike they plague our lives  Wanton headstrong cunning vain  Born to cheat and give men pain  Their study day and night  Is mischief their delight  And if we should prevent  At one door their intent  They quickly turn about  And find another out  SCENE II  Lord  AIMWORTH FAIRFIELD RALPH  Ral  Dear goodness my lord I doubts I have done some wrong here I hope your honour will forgive me to be sartin if I had known  L Aim  You have done nothing but what's very right my lad don't make yourself uneasy How now master Fairfield what brings you here  Fairf  I am come my lord to thank you for your bounty to me and my daughter this morning and most humbly to intreat your lordship to receive it at our hands again  L Aim  Aywhy what's the matter  Fairf  I don't know my lord it seems your generosity to my poor girl has been noised about the neighbourhood and some evil minded people have put it into the young man's head that was to marry her that you would never have made her a present so much above her deserts and expectations if it had not been upon some naughty account now my lord I am a poor man 'tis true and a mean one but I and my father and my father's father have liv'd tenants upon your lordship's estate where we have always been known for honest men and it shall never be said that Fairfield the miller became rich in his old days by the wages of his child's shame  L Aim  What then master Fairfield do you believe  Fairf  No my lord no Heaven forbid but when I consider the sum it is too much for us it is indeed my lord and enough to make bad folks talk besides my poor girl is greatly alter'd she us'd to be the life of every place she came into but since her being at home I have seen nothing from her but sadness and watry eyes  L Aim  The farmer then refuses to marry Patty notwithstanding their late reconciliation  Fairf  Yes my lord he does indeed and has made a wicked noise and used us in a very base manner I did not think farmer Giles would have been so ready to believe such a thing of us  L Aim  Well master Fairfield I will not press on you a donation the rejection of which does you so much credit you may take my word however that your fears upon this occasion are entirely groundless but this is not enough as I have been the means of losing your daughter one husband it is but just I should get her another and since the farmer is so scrupulous there is a young man in the house here whom I have some influence over and I dare say he will be less squeamish  Fairf  To be sure my lord you have in all honest ways a right to dispose of me and mine as you think proper  L Aim  Go then immediately and bring Patty hither I shall not be easy till I have given you entire satisfaction But stay and take a letter which I am stepping into my study to write I'll order a chaise to be got ready that you may go back and forward with greater expedition  AIR  Let me flyhence tyrant fashion  Teach to servile minds your law  Curb in them each generous passion  Ev'ry motion keep in awe  Shall I in thy trammels going  Quit the idol of my heart  While it beats all fervent glowing  With my life I'll sooner part  SCENE III  RALPH FANNY  Fan  Ralph Ralph  Ral  What do you want with me eh  Fan  Lord I never knowed such a man as you are since I com'd into the world a body can't speak to you but you falls straightways into a passion I follow'd you up from the house only you run so there was no such a thing as overtaking you and I have been waiting there at the back door ever so long  Ral  Well and now you may go and wait at the fore door if you like it but I forewarn you and your gang not to keep lurking about our mill any longer for if you do I'll send the constable after you and have you every mother's skin clapt in the county gaol you are such a pack of thieves one can't hang so much as a rag to dry for you it was but the other day that a couple of them came into our kitchen to beg a handful of dirty flour to make them cakes and before the wench could turn about they had whipped off three brass candlesticks and a potlid  Fan  Well sure it was not I  Ral  Then you know that old rascal that you call father the last time I catched him laying snares for the hares I told him I'd inform the gamekeeper and I'll expose all  Fan  Ah dear Ralph don't be angry with me  Ral  Yes I will be angry with youwhat do you come nigh me foryou shan't touch me there's the skirt of my coat and if you do but lay a finger on it my lord's bailiff is here in the court and I'll call him and give you to him  Fan  If you'll forgive me I go down on my knees  Ral  I tell you I won'tno no follow your gentleman or go live upon your old sare crows and pole cats and sheep that die of the rot pick the dead  fowl off of dunghills and squench your thirst at the next ditch 'tis the fittest liquor to wash down such dainties skulking about from barn to barn and lying upon wet straw on commons and in greenlanesgo and be whipt from parish to parish as you used to be  Fan  How can you talk so unkind  Ral  And see whether you will get what will keep you as I did by telling of fortunes and coming with pillows under your apron among the young farmers wives to make believe you are a breeding "with the Lord Almighty bless you sweet mistress you cannot tell how soon it may be your own case" You know I am acquainted with all your tricksand how you turn up the whites of your eyes pretending you were struck blind by thunder and lightning  Fan  Pray don't be angry Ralph  Ral  Yes but I will tho' spread your cobwebs to catch flies I am an old wasp and don't value them a button  AIR  When you meet a tender creature  Neat in limb and fair in feature  Full of kindness and good nature  Prove as kind again to she  Happy mortal to possess her  In your bosom warm and press her  Morning noon and night caress her  And be fond as fond can be  But if one you meet that's froward  Saucy jilting and untoward  Should you act the whining coward  'Tis to mend her ne'er the whit  Nothing's tough enough to bind her  Then agog when once you find her  Let her go and never mind her  H  art alive you're fairly quit  SCENE IV  FANNY  I wish I had a draught of waterI don't know what's come over me I have no more strength than a babe a straw would fling me downhe has a heart as hard as any parish officer I don't doubt now but he would stand by and see me whipt himself and we shall all be whipt and all through my means The devil run away with the gentleman and his twenty guineas too for leading me astray if I had known Ralph would have taken it so I would have hanged myself before I would have said a wordbut I thought he had no more gaul than a pidgeon  AIR  O what a simpleton was I  To make my bed at such a rate  Now lay thee down vain fool and cry  Thy true love seeks another mate  No tears alack  Will call him back  No tender words his heart allure  I could bite  My tongue thro' spite  Some plague bewitch'd me that's for sure  SCENE V  Changes to a room in the miller's house  Enter  GILES  followed by  PATTY  and  THEODOSIA  Giles  AIR  Women's tongues are like mill clappers  And from thence they learn the knack  Of for ever sounding clack  Why what the plague's the matter with you What do you scold at me for I am sure I did not say an uncivil word as I do know of I'll be judged by the young lady if I did  Pat  'Tis very well farmer all I desire is that you will leave the house you see my father is not at home at present when he is if you have any thing to say you know where to come  Giles  Enough said I don't want to stay in the house not I and I don't much care if I had never come into it  Theo  For shame farmer down on your knees and beg Miss Fairfield's pardon for the outrage you have been guilty of  Giles  Beg pardon Miss for whaticod that's well enough why I am my own master ben't I If I have no mind to marry there's no harm in that I hope 'tis only changing handsThis morning she would not have me and now I won't have she  Pat  Have you Heav'ns and earth do you think then 'tis the missing of you that gives me concern no I would prefer a state of beggary a thousand times beyond any thing I could enjoy with you and be assured if ever I was seemingly consenting to such a sacrifice nothing should have compelled me to it but the cruelty of my situation  Giles  O as for that I believes you but you see the gudgeon would not bite as I told you a bit agone you know we farmers never love to reap what we don't sow  Pat  You brutish fellow how dare you talk  Giles  So now she's in her tantarums again and all for no manner of yearthly thing  Pat  But be assured my lord will punish you severely for daring to make free with his name  Giles  Who made free with it did ever I mention my lord 'tis a cursed lie  Theo  Bless me farmer  Giles  Why it is Missand I'll make her prove her words then what does she mean by being punished I am not afraid of nobody nor beholding to nobody that I know of while I pays my rent my money I believe is as good as another's egad if it goes there I think there be those deserve to be punished more nor I  Pat  Was ever unfortunate creature pursued as I am by distresses and vexations  Theo  My dear PattySee farmer you have thrown her into tearspray be comforted  Patty  AIR  Oh leave me in pity the falsehood I scorn  For slander the bosom untainted defies  But rudeness and insult are not to be borne  Tho' offer'd by wretches we've sense to despise  Of woman defenceless how cruel the fate  Pass ever so cautious so blameless her way  Ill nature and envy lurk always in wait  And innocence falls to their fury a prey  SCENE VI  MERVIN THEODOSIA  Theo  You are a pretty gentleman are not you to suffer a lady to be at a rendezvous before you  Mer  Difficulties my dear and dangersNone of the company had two suits of apparel so I was obliged to purchase a rag of one and a tatter from another at the expence of ten times the sum they would fetch at the paper mill  Theo  Well where are they  Mer  Here in this bundleand tho' I say it a very decent habiliment if you have art enough to stick the parts together I've been watching till the coast was clear to bring them to

your metamorphosis  she goes in  and if you are not tedious we may walk off without being seen by any one  Theo  Ha ha ha what a concourse of atoms are here tho' as I live they are a great deal better than I expected  Mer  Well pray make haste and don't imagine yourself at your toilette now where mode prescribes two hours for what reason would scarce allow three minutes  Theo  Have patience the outward garment is on already and I'll assure you a very good stuff only a little the worse for the mending  Mer  Imagine it embroidery and consider it is your wedding suitcome how far are you got  Theo  Stay you don't consider there's some contrivance necessaryHere goes the apron flounced and  furbelow'd with a witness alas alas it has no strings what shall I do come no matter a couple of pins

thou wert in the right  Giles  Why master Fairfield you do know I had a great regard for Miss Patty but when I come to consider all in all I finds as how it is not adviseable to change my condition yet a while  Fairf  Friend Giles thou art in the right marriage is a serious point and can't be considered too warily ha who have we here shall I never keep my house clear of these verminlook to the

part of my lord Aimworth look sir if the direction is not for you  Mer  "To Mr Mervin"it is  Fairf  And my young lady they are seeking for her I warrant high and lowBless you dear miss go up to his lordship's you'll find friends there enow and every thing fixed as you would have itThere is a chaise waiting at the door to carry youI and my daughter will take another way  SCENE VIII  MERVIN THEODOSIA GILES  Mer  Pry'thee read this letter and tell me what you think of it  Theo  Heavens 'tis a letter from my lord Aimworth we are betray'd  Mer  By what means I know not  Theo  I am so frighted and flurried that I have scarce strength enough to read it  SIR  It is with the greatest concern I find that I have been unhappily the occasion of giving some uneasiness to you and Miss Sycamore be assur'd had I been appriz'd of your prior pretensions and the young lady's disposition in your favour I should have been the last person to interrupt your felicity I beg sir you will do me the favour to come up to my house where I have already so far settled matters as to be able to assure you that every thing will go entirely to your satisfaction  Mer  Well  Theo  Well  Mer  What do you think of it  Theo  Nay what do you think of it  Mer  Egad I can't very well tellhowever on the whole I believe it would be wrong of us to proceed any further in our design of running away even if the thing was practicable  Theo  I am entirely of your opinion I swear this lord Aimworth is a charming man I fancy 'tis lucky for you I had not been long enough acquainted with him to find out all his good qualitiesBut how the duce came he to hear  Mer  No matter after this there can be nothing to apprehendwhat say you shall we go up to the castle  Theo  By all means and in this very trim to shew what we were capable of doing if my father and mother had not come to reasonbut perhaps the difficulties being remov'd may lessen your  penchant  You men are such unaccountable mortalsDo you love me well enough to marry me without making a frolick of it  Mer  Do I love you  Theo  Ay and to what degree  Mer  Why do you ask me  AIR  Who upon the oozy beech  Can count the numerous sands that lie  Or distinctly reckon each  Transparent orb that studs the sky  As their multitude betray  And frustrate all attempts to tell  So 'tis impossible to say  How much I love I love so well  SCENE IX  GILES  So there goes a couple ecod I believe Old Nick has got among the people in these parts This is as queer a thing as ever I heard ofMaster Fairfield and Miss Patty it seems are gone to the castle too where by what I larns from Ralph in the mill my lord has promised to get her a husband among the servants now set in case the wind sets in that corner I have been thinking with myself who the plague it can be there are no unmarried men in the family that I do know of excepting little Bob the postilion and master Jonathan the butler and he's a matter of sixty or seventy years old I'll be shot if it bean't little Bob Icod I'll take the way to the castle as well as the rest for I'd fain see how the nail do drive It is well I had wit enough to discern things and a friend to advise with or else she would have fallen to my lot but I have got a surfeit of going a courting and burn me if I won't live a batchelor for when all comes to all I see nothing but ill blood and quarrels among folk when they be married  AIR  Then hey for a frolicksome life  I'll ramble where pleasures are rife  Strike up with the free hearted lasses  And never think more of a wife  Plague on it men are but asses  To run after noise and strife  Had we been together buckl'd  'Twould have prov'd a fine affair  Dogs would have bark'd at the cuckold  And boys pointing cry'dLook there  SCENE X  Changes to a grand apartment in Lord  AIMWORTH  's house opening to a view of the garden  Enter Lord  AIMWORTH FAIRFIELD PATTY RALPH  L Aim  Thus master Fairfield I hope I have fully satisfied you with regard to the falsity of the imputation thrown upon your daughter and me if there yet remains a doubt you are at liberty to speak it  Fairf  My lord I am very well content pray do not give yourself the trouble of saying any more  Ralph  No my lord you need not say any more to us we are very well content  Fairf  Hold your tongue sirrah  L Aim  I am sorry Patty you have had this mortification  Pat  I am sorry my lord you have been troubled about it but really it was against my consent my father would  Fairf  Well come children we will not take up his honour's time any longer let us be going towards homeHeav'n prosper your lordship the pray'rs of me and my family shall always attend you  L Aim  Miller come backPatty stay  Fairf  Has your lordship any thing further to command us  L Aim  Why yes master Fairfield I have a word or two still to say to youIn short though you are satisfied in this affair I am not and you seem to forget the promise I made you that since I had been the means of losing your daughter one husband I would find her another  Fairf  Your honour is to do as you please  L Aim  What say you Patty will you accept of a husband of my chusing  Pat  My lord I have no determination you are the best judge how I ought to act whatever you command I shall obey  L Aim  Then Patty there is but one person I can offer youand I wish for your sake he was more deservingtake me  Pat  Sir  L Aim  From this moment our interests are one as our hearts and no earthly power shall ever divide us  Fairf  O the gracious Patty my lord did I hear right you sir you marry a child of mine  L Aim  Yes my honest old man in me you behold the husband design'd for your daughter and I am happy that by standing in the place of fortune who has alone been wanting to her I shall be able to set her merit in a light where its lustre will be render'd conspicuous  Fairf  But good noble sir pray consider don't go to put upon a silly old man my daughter is unworthy Patty child why don't you speak  Pat  What can I say father what answer to such unlook'd for such unmerited such unbounded generosity  Ralph  Down on your knees and fall a crying  Pat  Yet sir as my father says consideryour noble friends your relationsit must not cannot be  L Aim  It must and shall Friends relations from henceforth I have none that will not acknowledge you and I am sure when they become acquainted with your perfections those whose suffrage I most esteem will rather admire the justice of my choice than wonder at its singularity  AIR  L Aim  My life my joy my blessing  In thee each grace possessing  All must my choice approve  Patty  To you my all is owing  O take a heart o'erflowing  With gratitude and love  L Aim  Thus infolding  Patty  Thus beholding  Both  One to my soul so dear  Can there be pleasure greater  Can there be bliss compleater  'Tis too much to bear  SCENE XI  Enter Sir  HARRY  Lady  SYCAMORE THEODOSIA MERVIN  Sir Har  Well we have followed your lordship's counsel and made the best of a bad marketSo my lord please to know our soninlaw that is to be  L Aim  You do me a great deal of honour I wish you joy Sir with all my heartAnd now Sir Harry give me leave to introduce to you a new relation of mine This Sir is shortly to be my wife  Sir Har  My lord  L Syc  Your lordship's wife  L Aim  Yes Madam  L Syc  And why so my lord  L Aim  Why faith Ma'am because I can't live happy without her And I think she has too many amiable too many estimable qualities to meet with a worse fate  Sir Har  Well but you are a peer of the realm you will have all the fleerers  L Aim  I know very well the ridicule that may be thrown on a lord's marrying a miller's daughter and I own with blushes it has for some time had too great weight with me but we should marry to please ourselves not other people and on mature consideration I can see no reproach justly merited by raising a deserving woman to a station she is capable of adorning let her birth be what it will  Sir Har  Why 'tis very true my lord I once knew a gentleman that married his cook maid he was a relation of my ownyou remember fat Margery my lady She was a very good sort of a woman indeed she was and made the best suet dumplings that ever I tasted  La Syc  Will you never learn Sir Harry to guard your expressionsWell but give me leave my lord to say a word to youthere are other ill consequences attending such an alliance  L Aim  One of them I suppose is that I a peer should be obliged to call this good old miller fatherinlaw but where's the shame in that he is as good as any lord in being a man and if we dare suppose a lord that is not an honest man he is in my opinion the more respectable character Come master Fairfield give me your hand from henceforth you have done with working we will pull down your mill and build you a house in the place of it and the money I intended for the portion of your daughter shall now be laid out in purchasing a commission for your son  Ralph  What my lord will you make

Aim  What have you nothing to say to your old acquaintanceCome pray let the farmer salute younay a kiss I insist upon it  Omnes  Ha ha ha  L Aim  Fye master Giles don't look so sheepish you and I were rivals but not less friends at present You have acted in this affair like an honest Englishman who scorn'd even the shadow of dishonour and thou shalt sit rent free for a twelvemonth  Sir Har  Come shan't we all saluteWith your leave my lord I'll  La Syc  Sir Harry  AIR  L Aim  Yield who will to forms a martyr  While unaw'd by idle shame  Pride for happiness I barter  Heedless of the millions

Har  Dad but this is wond'rous pretty  Singing each a roundelay  And I'll mingle in the ditty  Tho' I scarce know what to say  There's a daughter brisk and witty  Here's a wife can wisely sway  Trust
