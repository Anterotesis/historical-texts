Regions vent your Clamours loud  Nor rend the fleecy mantle of this Cloud  Free from Strife from Anger free  Calm and Concord dwell with me  Hence for ever darkbrow'd Storm  Nor Heav'n's azure Sky deform  Blueey'd Zephyrs in thy place  Breathing soft thro' airy space  Hail me as I peaceful rise  The Halcyon  Genius  of those happy Skies  SONG  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  ISKOURIAH  HIS Limbs may

My Task I'll do with Master Art  Those Graces shall by Angels wove  Entwine two Souls in constant Love  BOTH TOGETHER  Those Graces c c c  SONG  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  ACBA  I'VE read of Love and all his Tricks  That he doth Gall with Honey mix  But I'm a Bust with Heart of Steel  That can nor Pain nor Pleasure feel  And let me still unmov'd remain  He wants no Joy that feels no Pain  O No O No O No  He wants no Joy who feels no Pain  I'M blind alike to Smile or Tear  I eat I drink I see and hear  The merry Songsters on the Spray  While lovesick Boys pine out each day  O let me still unmov'd remain  He wants no Joy that feels no Pain  O No O No O No  He wants no Joy who feels no Pain  My undisturb'd repose I take  While Cupid keeps all Men awake  While he with Sighs annoys each Breast  I sing and nightly take my rest  So let me still unmov'd remain  He wants no Joy that feels no Pain  O No O No O No  He wants no Joy who feels no Pain  SONG  NAINDA  THE Morning Star ah see  How soft how mild her light  She leads ISKOURIAH on her way  Expelling sable Night  DUET CHORUS  MUSIC BY SAPIO  OH ALLAH rive us means to bear  Her mind from Love's corroding Care  Give Peace within this Virgin Breast  Where nought but Peace and Joy should rest  Nor let her Thoughts like Tempests move  In wildest Labyrinths of Love  OH ALLAH give us means to bear  Her mind from Love's corroding Care  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SONG  MUSIC FRENCH ROMANCE  MORAD  ON the high Top of an old mould'ring Tow'r  An angry Eagle perch'd his fav'rite Son  Then frowning said"There pass each lonesome hour  "Nor till I give you leave can you come down  DUET "Can you come down  " Can you come down"  The youthful Eaglet lov'd in woods to play  With Birds of Feathers bright or softest Down  So much abash'd he to himself did say  "Unhappy Royal Bird you must come down  "You must come down  "You must come down  "Your own determin'd Will must set you free  "Inactive here you cannot fit and moan  "Courage secures to Man his Liberty  "And Youth courageous Youth may venture down  "May venture down  "May venture down"  Then op'ning quick the rusty shutter wide  He hail'd the friendly Lustre of the Moon  With royal Fortitude and manly Pride  For love of Freedom soon he ventures down  He ventures down  He ventures down  SONG  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  OLD WOMAN  I'll tell you your Fortune averse from all Art  Plain Truth ever flows from my Tongue  Yet I carry like Bees the kind Honey at Heart  To heal where my words may have stung  My Power's unbounded whate'er I may seem  My Dwelling is in the Blue Sky  Tho' oft on the back of a tranquil Moonbeam  On Earth for Diversion I fly  Let other good Fairies use Circles and Wands  A future Event to foretell  Trace Lines in the Palm of a TrueLovers Hand  Exhaust all the Power of Spell  Tis alone thro' the Eyes I descry Fortune's Light  See only to rectify Fate  Like the Sun I dispel the black Vapours of Night  Then listen before 'tis too late  TRIO  MUSIC BY PAESIELLO  BOTH  Oh give us leave to go with you  It is our Wish and Duty too  OLD WOMAN  No no No no it cannot be  He is secure who flies with me  GIOBAR  With you Ha ha ha he go with you  MORAD  Oh oh Oh ohThis is quite new  OLD WOMAN  It may be strange it may be new  But still believe me it is true  That what my Will is that must be  And he's secure that flies with me  SONG  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  ZARA  WHEN I am marry'd Mercies how I 'll talk  And rule at home like any potent Queen  Fair creatures like myself should never walk  I'll have a gold and silver Palanquin  The Men shall all adore my angel's face  The Women fall before me as I pass  I'll ogle and sigh I'll smoke and I'll spit  Tell many a lie now and then have a fit  And study my charms in the glass  I'll have a thousand fancies in the day  And change 'em ev'ry hour with the wind  I'll never work at all but always play  To chase dull care and sorrow from my mind  The Men shall all c c  SONG  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  MORAD  SHE is ugly and old  And looks like a Scold  Her Nose like a spout to her Head  Her Robe ragged and black  Not a Shift to her back  And must beg all the way to have Bread  Well if I go astray  Or like him run away  It shall be with a Girl like a Roe  With a Cheek like a Rose  A small cock'dup Nose  With Arms and a Bosom of Snow  SONG  MUSIC BY SAPIO  BY A YOUNG TURK  O Fairest of the Fair whose spotless Charms  Must bless a lovely Prince's youthful Arms  Receive these Gems that will but dim appear  When Eyes so brightILLYDIA's Eyes are near  SONG  MUSIC BY SAPIO  ISKOURIAH  THE Shipwreck'd Sailor cast from off the Strand  Labours for Life and thinks it almost gone  More welcome to his Sight appears the Land  More cheering than the brightest Morning Sun  But oh to me who can no lower fall  REVENGE is sweeter far  Revenge  is all  Revenge Revenge  Revenge  is ALL  AIR  MUSIC BY THE MARGRAVINE  I  ANGELS and GENII point the way secure  To Honour Fame to Friendship and to Love  Like Stars their Course is heav'nly bright and pure  For by Omniscient Pow'r alone they move  CHORUS  Oh drive from hence Remorse and fell Despair  Be Love and Constancy your only Care  II  T' improve to save Mankind our only toil  Ours be the Task to pity and reclaim  Our only recompense a heavenly smile  Disdaining earthly Tributes to our Fame  CHORUS  Oh drive from hence Remorse and fell Despair  Be Love and Constancy your only Care  THE END
