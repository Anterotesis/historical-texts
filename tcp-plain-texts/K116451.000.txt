 THE FARMER'S BOY A RURAL POEM  THE FARMER'S BOY A RURAL POEM IN FOUR BOOKS BY ROBERT BLOOMFIELD  A Shepherd's Boyhe seeks no better name  With Ornaments engraved in Wood by Anderson  LONDON PRINTED BY T BENSLEY BOLTCOURT FLEETSTREET FOR VERNOR AND HOOD POULTRY TC RICKMAN UPPER MARYLEBONESTREET INGRAM BURY AND BOOTH NORWICH  MDCCC  PREFACE  HAVING the satisfaction of introducing to the Public this very pleasing and characteristic POEM the FARMER's BOY I think it will be agreeable to preface it with a short Account of the manner in which it came into my hands and which will be much more interesting to every Reader a little History of the Author which has been communicated to me by his Brother and which I shall very nearly transcribe as it lies before me  In  November  last year I received a MS which I was requested to read and to give my opinion of it It had before been shewn to some persons in  London  whose indifference toward it may probably be explained when it is considered that it came to their hands under no circumstances of adventitious recommendation With some a person must be rich or titled or fashionable as a literary name or at least fashionable in some respect good or bad before any thing which he can offer will be thought worthy of notice  I had been a little accustomed to the effect of prejudices and I was determined to judge in the only just and reasonable way of the Work by the Work itself  At first I confess seeing it divided into the four Seasons I had to encounter a prepossession not very advantageous to any writer that the Author was treading in a path already so admirably trod by THOMSON and might be adding one more to an attempt already so often but so injudiciously and unhappily made of transmuting that noble Poem from Blank Verse into Rhimefrom its own pure native Gold into an alloyed Metal of incomparably less splendor permanence and worth  I had soon however the pleasure of finding myself relieved from that apprehension and of discovering that although the delineation of RURAL SCENERY naturally branches itself into these divisions there was little else except the General Qualities of a musical car flowing numbers Feeling Piety poetic Imagery and Animation a taste for the picturesque a true sense of the natural and pathetic force of thought and liveliness of imagination which were in common between Thomson and this Author And these are qualities which whoever has the eye the heart the awakened and surrounding intellect and the diviner sense of the Poet which alone can deserve the name must posses  But with these general Characters of true Poetry  "The Farmer's Boy"  has as I have said a character of its own It is discriminated as much as the circumstances and habits and situation and ideas consequently associated which are so widely diverse in the two Authors could make it different Simplicity sweetness a natural tenderness that  molle atque facetum  which HORACE celebrates in the Eclogues of VIRGIL will be found to belong to it  I intend some farther and more particular CRITICAL REMARKS on this charming Performance But I now pass to the Account of the Author himself as given me by his Brothera Man to whom also I was entirely a strangerbut whose Candor good Sense and brotherly Affection appear in this Narrative and of the justness of whose Understanding and the Goodness of his Heart I have had many Proofs in consequence of a correspondence with him on different occasions which have since arise when this had made me acquainted with him and interested me in his behalf  In writing to me Mr GEORGE BLOOMFIELD who is a Shoemaker also as his Brother and lives at BURY thus expresses himself  "As I spent five years with the Author from the time he was thirteen years and a half old till he was turned of eighteen the most interesting time of life I mean the time that instruction is acquired if acquired at all I think I am able to give a better account of him than any one can or than he can of himself for his Modesty would not let him speak of his Temper Disposition or Morals"  "ROBERT was the younger Child of GEORGE BLOOMFIELD a  Taylor  at HONINGTON  This Village is between  Euston  and  Troston  and about nine miles NE of  Bury  L  His Father died when he was an infant under a year old His Mother  ELIZABETH Daughter of ROBERT MANBY Vide Note at the end of this Preface  was a Schoolmistress and instructed her own Children with the others He thus learned to read as soon as he learned to speak"  "Though the Mother was left a Widow with six small Children yet with the help of Friends she managed to give each of them a little schooling"  "ROBERT was accordingly sent to Mr RODWELL  This respectable Men is senior Clerk to the Magistrates of the Hundred of BLACKBOURN in which Honington is situated and has conducted himself with great propriety in this and other public employments L  of Ixworth to be improved in  Writing  but he did not go to that School more than two or three months nor was ever sent to any other his Mother again marrying when ROBERT was about seven years old"  "By her second Husband JOHN GLOVER she had another Family"  "When  Robert  was not above  eleven  years old the late Mr W AUSTIN of SAPISTON  This little Village adjoins to HO  INGTON L  took him And though it is customary for Farmers to pay such Boys only is d per week yet he generously took him into the house This relieved his Mother of any other expence than only of finding him a few things to wear and this was more than she well knew how to do"  "She wrote therefore" Mr G BLOOMFIELD continues "to me and my Brother NAT then in London to assist her mentioning that he ROBERT was so small of his age that Mr AUSTIN said he was not likely to be able to get his living by hard labour"  Mr G BLOOMFIELD on this informed his Mother that if she would let him take the Boy with him he would take him and teach him to make shoes and NAT promised to clothe him The Mother upon this offer took coach and came to LONDON to Mr BLOOMFIELD with the Boy for she said she never should have been happy if she had not put him herself into his hands  "She charged me" he adds  "as I valued a Mother's Blessing to watch over him to set good Examples for him and never to forget that he had lost his Father"  I religiously confine myself to Mr G BLOOMFIELD's own words and think I should wrong all the parties concerned if in mentioning this pathetic and successful Admonition I were to use any other  Mr G BLOOMFIELD then lived at Mr  Simm's  No  Tisher'scourt Bellalley Colemanstreet  "It is customary" he continues "in such houses as are let to poor people in  London  to have light Garrets fit for Mechanics to work in In the Garret where we had two turnup Beds and five of us worked I received little ROBERT"  "As we were all single Men Lodgers at a Shilling per week each our beds were coarse and all things far from being clean and snug like what  Robert  had left at SAPISTON  Robert  was our man to fetch all things to hand At Noon he fetched our Dinners from the Cook's Shop and any one of our fellow workmen that wanted to have any thing fetched in would send him and assist in his work and teach him for a recompense for his trouble"  Every day when the Boy from the Publichouse came for the pewter pots and to hear what Porter was wanted he always brought the yesterday's  Newspaper  There was then neither as a resource for the exigencies of finance nor as a Principle of supposed Policy that unhappy Check which prevails now on the circulation of  Newspapers  and other means of  popular  Information L  The  reading  of the Paper we had been used to take by turns but after  Robert  came he mostly read for usbecause his time was of least value"  "He frequently met with words that he was unacquainted with of this he often complained I one day happened at a Bookstall to see a small Dictionary which had been very ill used I bought it for him for d By the help of this he in little time could read and comprehend the long and beautiful speeches of BURKE FOX or NORTH  "One  Sunday  after an whole day's stroll in the country we by accident went into a dissenting  Meetinghouse  in the  Old Jewry  where a Gentleman was lecturing This Man filled little  Robert  with astonishment The House was amazingly crowded with the most genteel people and though we were forced to stand still in the Aisle and were much pressed yet  Robert  always quickened his steps to get into the Town on a Sunday evening soon enough to attend this Lecture  "The Preacher lived somewhere at the West End of the Townhis name was FAWCET His language" says Mr G BLOOMFIELD "was just such as the  Rambler  is written in his Action like a person acting a Tragedy his Discourse rational and free from the Cant of Methodism  "Of him  Robert  learned to accent what he called  hard  words and otherwise improved himself and gained the most enlarged notions of PROVIDENCE  "He went sometimes with me to a  Debating Society  It is another of the Constitutional Refinements of these times to have fettered and as to every valuable purpose silenced these Debating Societies They were at least to say the lowest of them far better amusements than drunkenness gambling or fighting They were no useless Schools to some of our very celebrated Speakers at the Bar and in Parliament and what is of infinitely more importance they contributed to the diffusion of Political Knowledge and Public Sentiment L  at  coachmaker'shall  but not often and a few times to  Coventgarden Theatre  These are all the opportunities he ever had to learn from Public Speakers As to  Books  he had to wade through two or three Folios an  History of England British Traveller  and a  Geography  But he always read them as a task or to oblige us who bought them And as they came in sixpenny numbers weekly he had about as many hours to read as other boys spend in play"  "I at that time" proceeds his Brother "read the  London Magazine  and in that work about two sheets were set apart for a  ReviewRobert  seemed always eager to read this Review Here he could see what the Literary Men were doing and learn how to judge of the merits of the Works that come out And I observed that he always looked at the  Poet's Corner  And one day he repeated a  Song  which he composed to an old tune I was much surprised that a boy of sixteen should make so smooth verses so I persuaded him to try whether the Editor of our Paper would give them a place in  Poel's Corner  And he succeeded and they were printed And as I forget his other early productions I shall copy this"  THE MILKMAID  ON THE FIRST OF MAY  I  Hail  MAY  lovely  MAY  how replenish'd my pails  The young Dawn overspreads the East streak'd with gold  My glad heart beats time to the laugh of the Vale  And  COLIN  's voice rings through the woods from the sold  II  The Wood to the Mountain submissively bends  Whose blue misty summits first glow with the sun  See thence a gay train by the wild rill descends  To join the glad sportshark the tumults begun  III  Be cloudless ye skiesBe my Colin but there  Not the dewspangled bents on the wide level Dale  Nor Morning's first blush can more lovely appear  Than his Looks since my wishes I could not conceal  IV  Swift down the mad dance while blest health prompts to move  Well count joys to come and exchange Vows of truth  And haply when Age cools the transports of Love  Decry like good folks the rain pleasures of youth  V  No no the remembrance shall ever be dear  At no time  LOVE  with  INNOCENCE  ceases to charm  It is transport in Youthand it smiles through the tear  When they feel in their children it's first soft alarm  The Writer of this Preface doubts whether he has been successful in adding the last Stanza to this beautiful and simply expressive Song But he imagined that some thought of this kind was in the mind of the Author and he was willing to endeavour to express it The Breast which has felt Love justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction as from annihilation itself And there is even an high social and moral use in that order of Providence which exalts Sensations into tender and benign Passions those Passions into habitual Affections yet more tender and raises from those Affections  Virtues  the most permanent the most necessary and beneficent and the most endearing thus expanding the sentiment into all the Charities of domestic and social Life  "I remember" says Mr G BLOOMFIELD continuing his Narrative "a little piece which he called  the Sailor's Return  It is much to be wished that this may be discovered L  in which he tried to describe the feelings of an honest  Tar  who after a long absence saw his dear native Village first rising into view This too obtain'd a place in the Poet's Corner"  "And as he was so young" his Brother proceeds "it shews some Genius in him and some Industry to have acquired so much knowledge of the use of words in so little time Indeed at this time myself and my fellow workmen in the Garret began to got instructions from him though not more than sixteen years old"  What simple magnanimity and benevolence in this Remark L  "About this time there came a Man to lodge at our Lodgings that was troubled with fits ROBERT was so much hurt  to see this poor creature drawn into such frightful forms and to hear his horrid screams that I was forced to leave the Lodging We went to  Blue Hartcourt Bellalley  In our new Garret we found a singular character James Kay a native of  Dundee  He was a middleaged man of a good understanding and yet a furious  Calvinist  He had many Booksand some which he did not value such as the SEASONS PARADISE LOST and some  Novels  These Books he lent to ROBERT who spent all his leisure hours in reading the  Seasons  which he was now capable of reading I never heard him give so much praise to any Book as to that"  "I think it was in the year that the Question came to be decided between the  journeymen Shoemakers  whether those who had learn'd without serving an  Apprenticeship  could follow the Trade"  That is  as journeymen  for there was no Question that they could not as  Masters  on their  own  account That a person may work as a  journeyman  without having served an apprenticeship had already been determined T G  Beach v Turner  Burr Mans  A person also who has not served an Apprenticeship may be a  partner  contributing money or advice and attention to the accounts and general concerns of the Trade provided that he does not actually exercise the Trade and that the acting partner has served Vide  Reynolds v Chase  M g Burr Mansf Burn JP Apprent § L  "The Man by whom  Robert  and I were employ'd Mr CHAMBERLAYNE of  Cheapside  took an active part against the lawful journeymen and even went so far as to pay off every man that worked for him that had joined their Clubs This so exasperated the men that their acting Committee soon looked for  unlawful men  as they called them among  Chamberlayne's  workmen"  They found out little  Robert  and threatened to prosccute  Chamberlayne  for employing him and to prosecute his Brother Mr  G Bloomfield  for teaching him Chamberlayne requested of the Brother to go on and bring it to a Trial for that he would defend it and that neither  George  nor  Robert  should be hurt  In the mean time  George  was much insulted for having refused to join upon this occasion those who called themselves exclusively the  Lawful Crafts George  who says he was never famed for patience it is not indeed so much as might be sometimes wished very often the lot of strong and acute minds to possess largely of this virtue took his pen and addressed a Letter to one of the most active of their Committeemen a man of very bad character In this after stating that he took  Robert  at his Mother's request he made free as well with the private character of this man as with the views of the Committee "This" says  George  "was very foolish for it made things worse but I felt too much to refrain"  What connects this episodical circumstance with the character of our Author follows in his Brother's words  "  Robert  naturally fond of Peace and fearful for my personal safety begged to be suffered to retire from the storm  "He came home and Mr AUSTIN kindly bade him take his house for his home till he could return to me And here with his mind glowing with the fine Descriptions of rural scenery which he found in THOMSON'S SEASONS he again retraced the very fields where first he began to think Here  free from smoke  But one word is altered in this Description which reminds one of the  Fun  m  St  pitume  e Romae  L  the noise the contention of the City he imbibed that Love of rural Simplicity and rural Innocence which fitted him in a great degree to be the writer of such a thing as  the Farmer's Boy  "  "Here he lived two Monthsat length as the dispute in the trade still remained undecided Mr DUDBRIDGE offered to take  Robert  Apprentice to secure him at all events from any consequences of the Litigation"  He was bound by Mr  Ingram  of  Bellalley  to Mr  John Dudbridge  His Brother  George  paid five shillings for  Robert  by way of form as a premium Dudbridge was their Landlord and a  Freeman  of the  City  of  London  He acted most honourably and took no advantage of the power which the Indentures gave him  George Bloomfield  staid with  Robert  till he found he could work as expertly as his self  Mr GEORGE BLOOMTIELD adds "When I left  London  he was turned of eighteen and much of my happiness since has arisen from a constant correspondence which I have held with him"  "After I left him he studied  Music  and was a good player on the  Violin  "  "But as my Brother  Nut  had married a  Wooluich  woman it happened that  Robert  took a fancy to a comely young woman  MARY Her surname before marriage is mentioned in the next Page  of that Town whose Father is a boatbuilder in the Government yard there His name is CHURCH"  "Soon after he married  Robert  told me in a Letter that 'he had sold his Fiddle and got a Wife' Like most poor men he got a wife first and had to get household stuff afterward It took him some years to get out of ready furnished Lodgings At length by hard working c he acquired a Bed of his own and hired the room up one pair of stairs at  Bellalley Colemanstreet  The Landlord kindly gave him leave to sit and work in the light  Garret  two pair of stairs higher"  "In  this  Garret amid six or seven other workmen his active Mind employed itself in composing  the Parmer's Boy"  "In my correspondence I have seen several  poetical  effusions of his all of them of a good moral tendency but which he very likely would think do him little credit on that account I have not preserved them"  "ROBERT is a  Ladies Shoemaker  and works for DAVIES  Lomlardstreet  He is of a slender make of about  T    I  high very  dark  complexionHis MOTHER who is a very religious member of the  Church  of  England  took all the pains she could in his infancy to make him pious and as his Reason expanded his love of God and Man increased with it I never knew his fellow for mildness of temper and Goodness of Disposition And since I left him universally is he praised by those who know him best for the best of Husbands  an indulgent Father and quiet Neighbour He is about thirtytwo years old and has three Children"  Mr GEORGE BLOOMFIELD concludes this clear affectionate and interesting Narrative by a very kind Address to the Writer of this Preface But pleased as I am with the good opinion of a Man like him I must not take praise to myself for not having neglected or suppressed such a Work when it came into my hands And I have no farther merit than that of seeing what it was impossible for an unprejudiced Mind not to see and of doing what it was impossible not to do  But I join with him cordially in his prayer "that GOD  the Giver of thought  may as mental light spreads raise up many who will turn a listening ear and will not despise  The short and simple Annals of the Poor  Very few words will complete what remains to be added  Struck with the Work but not less struck with the Remark which is become a Proverb of the Roman Satirist that "  it is not easy  Hand facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat Res augusta domi  for those to emerge to notice whose circumstances obscure the observation of their Merits" I sent it to a Friend whom I knew to be above these prejudices and who has deserved and is deserving well of the Public in many other instances by his attention to Literature and the elegant Arts He immediately expressed an high satisfaction in it and communicated it to MESERS VERNOR and HOOD They adopted  in upon terms honorable to themselves and satisfactory to the Author and to me in his behalf They have published it in a manner which speaks abundantly for itself both as to the typographical accuracy and beauty and the good taste and execution of the Ornaments in Wood  My part has been this and it has been a very pleasing one to revise the MS making occasionally corrections with respect to Orthography and sometimes in the grammatical construction The corrections in point of Grammar reduce themselves almost wholly to a circumstance of provincial usage which even well educated persons in  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  do not wholly avoid and which may be said as to general custom to have become in these Counties almost an established Dialectthat of adopting the plural for the singular termination of verbs so as to exclude the  s  But not a line is added or substantially alter'd through the whole Poem I have requested the MS to be preserv'd for the satisfaction of those who may wish to be satisfied on this head  The  Proofs  have gone through my bands It has been printed slowly because most carefully as it deserv'd to be printed  I have no doubt of its Reception with the Public I have none of its going down to Posterity with honor which is not always the Fate of productions which are popular in their day  Thus much I knowthat the Author with a spirit amiable at all times and which would have been revered by Antiquity  seems far less interested concerning any Fame or Advantage he may derive from it to himself than in the pleasure of giving a printed Copy of it as a tribute of duty and affection to his MOTHER in whose pleasure if it succeeds his filial heart places the gratification of which it is most desirous It is much to be a POET such as he will be foundit is more to be such a MAN  CAPEL LOFFT  TROSTON n BERY SURROLK Dec  ELIZABETH MANBY the Mother of the Author of this POLM was sister to the wife of Mr WILLIAM AUSTIN I had written to Mr GEORGE BLOOMFIELD to request the name before Marriage of his Mother This gained me an Answer which I have great pleasure in adding  "The late Mr AUSTIN's wife was a Manby 'my Mother's sister And it may seem strange that in the FARMER's BOY  Giles  no where calls him  Uncle  but  Master  The treatment that my Brother  Robert  experienced from Mr  Austin  did not differ in any respect from the treatment that all the Servant Boys experienced who lived with him Mr  Austin  was Father of fourteen Children by my Aunt he never had any other wife He left a decent provision for the five Children that survived him so that it could not be expected he should have any thing to give to poor Relations And I don't see a possibility of making a difference between GILES and the Boys that were not related to Mr  Austin  for he treated all his Servants exactly as he did his Sons They all worked hard all lived well The DUKE had not a better Man Tenant to him than the late Mr  Austin  I saw numbers of the Husbandmen in tears when he was buried He was beloved by all who knew him But I imagine  Robert  thought that when he was speaking of Benevolence that was universal he had no occasion to mention the accidental circumstance of his being related to the Good Man of whom he sung"  SPRING  ARGUMENT  Invocation c Seed time Harrowing Morning walks Milking The Dairy Suffolk Cheese Spring coming forth Sheep fond of changing Lambs at play The Butcher c  SPRING  I  O COME blest Spirit whatsoe'er thou art  Thou rushing warmth that hovers round my heart  Sweet inmate hail thou source of sterling joy  That poverty itself cannot destroy  Be thou my Muse and faithful still to me  Retrace the paths of wild obscurity  No deeds of arms my humble lines rehearse  No  Alpine  wonders thunder through my verse  The roaring cataract the snowtopt hill  Inspiring awe till breath itself stands still  Nature's sublimer scenes ne'er charm'd mine eyes  Nor Science led me through the boundless skies  From meaner objects far my raptures flow  O point these raptures bid my bosom glow  And lead my soul to ecstacies of praise  For all the blessings of my infant days  Bear me through regions where gay Fancy dwells  But mould to Truth's fair form what Memory tells  Live trifling incidents and grace my song  That to the humblest menial belong  To him whose drudgery unheeded goes  His joys unreckon'd as his cares or woes  Though joys and cares in every path are sown  And youthful minds have feelings of their own  Quick springing sorrows transient as the dew  Delights from trifles trifles ever new  InvocationSimple character of Giles  v  'Twas thus with GILES meek fatherless and poor  Labour his portion but he felt no more  No stripes no tyranny his steps pursu'd  His life was constant cheerful servitude  Strange to the world he wore a bashful look  The Fields his study Nature was his book  And as revolving SEASONS chang'd the scene  From heat to cold tempestuous to serene  Though every change still varied his employ  Yet each new duty brought its share of joy  Where noble GRAFTON spreads his rich domains  Round  Euston's  water'd vale and sloping plains  Where woods and groves in solemn grandeur rise  Where the kite brooding unmolested flies  The woodcock and the painted pheasent race  And sculking foxes destin'd for the chace  There Giles untaught and unrepining stray'd  Through every copse and grove and winding glade  v  Euston in Suffolk and its neighbourhood the Scene  There his first thoughts to Nature's charms inclin'd  That stamps devotion on th' inquiring mind  A little farm his generous Master till'd  Who with peculiar grace his station fill'd  By deeds of hospitality endear'd  Serv'd from affection for his worth rever'd  A happy offspring blest his plenteous board  His fields were fruitful and his barns well stor'd  And fourscore ewes he fed a sturdy team  And lowing kine that grazed beside the stream  Unceasing industry he kept in view  And never lack'd a job for Giles to do  FLED now the sullen murmurs of the North  The splendied raiment of the SPRING peeps forth  Her universal green and the clear sky  Delight still more and more the gazing eye  Wide o'er the fields in rising moisture strong  Shoots up the simple flower or creeps along  Benevolent character of Giles's MasterSpring begins  v  The mellow'd soil imbibing as it goes  Fresh sweets from frequent showers and evening dews  That summon from its shed the slumb'ring ploughs  While health impregnates every breeze that blows  No wheels support the diving pointed share  No groaning ox is doom'd to labour there  No helpmates teach the docile steed his road  Alike unknown the plowboy and the goad  But unassisted through each toilsome day  With smiling brow the plowman cleaves his way  Draws his fresh parallels and wid'ning still  Treads slow the heavy dale or climbs the hill  Strong on the wing his busy followers play  Where writhing earthworms meet th' unwelcome day  Till all is chang'd and hill and level down  Assume a livery of sober brown  Again disturb'd when Giles with wearying strides  From ridge to ridge the ponderous harrow guides  v  Giles goes out to plow  His heels deep sinking every step he goes  Till dirt usurp the empire of his shoes  Welcome green headland firm beneath his feet  Welcome the friendly bank's refreshing seat  There warm with toil his panting horses browse  Their shelt'ring canopy of pendent boughs  Till rest delicious chase each transient pain  And newborn vigour swell in every vein  Hour after hour and day to day succeeds  Till every clod and deepdrawn furrow spreads  To crumbling mould a level surface clear  And strew'd with corn to crown the rising year  And o'er the whole Giles once transverse again  In earth's moist bosom buries up the grain  The work is done no more to man is give  The grateful farmer trusts the rest to Heaven  Yet oft with anxious heart he looks around  And marks the first green blade that breaks the ground  HarrowingGiles and his Horses rest  v  In fancy sees his trembling oats uprun  His tufted barley yellow with the sun  Sees clouds propitious shed their timely store  And all his harvest gather'd round his door  But still unsafe the big sowln grain below  A fav'rite morsel with the rook and crow  From field to field the flock increasing goes  To level crops most formidable foes  Their danger well the wary plunderers know  And place a watch on some conspicuous bough  Yet oft the sculking gunner by surprise  Will scatter death amongst them as they rise  These hung in triumph round the spacious field  At best will but a shortlived terror yield  Nor guards of property not penal law  But harmless riflemen of rags and straw  Familiariz'd to these they boldly rove  Nor heed such centinels that never move  v  Rooks  Let then your birds lie prostrate on the earth  In dying posture and with wings stretch'd forth  Shift them at eve or morn from place to place  And death shall terrify the pilfering race  In the mid air while circling round and round  They'll call their lifeless comrades from the ground  With quick'ning wing and notes of loud alarm  Warn the whole flock to shun the impending harm  This task had  Giles  in fields remote from home  Oft has he wish'd the rosy morn to come  Yet never fam'd was he nor foremost found  To break the seal of sleep his sleep was sound  But when at daybreak summon'd from his bed  Light as the lark that carol'd o'er his head  His sandy way deepworn by hasty showers  O'erarch'd with oaks that form'd fantastic bow'rs  Waving aloft their tow'ring branches proud  In borrow'd tinges from the eastern cloud  Wood Scenery  v  Whence inspiration pure as ever flow'd  And genuine transport in his bosom glow'd  His own shrill matin join'd the various notes  Of Nature's music from a thousand throats  The blackbird strove with emulation sweet  And Echo answer'd from her close retreat  The sporting whitethroat on some twig's end borne  Pour'd hymns to freedom and the rising morn  Stopt in her song perchance the starting thrush  Shook a white shower from the blackthorn bush  Where dewdrops thick as early blossoms hung  And trembled as the minstrel sweetly sung  Across his path in either grove to hide  The timid rabbit scouted by his side  Or bold cockpheasant stalk'd along the road  Whose gold and purple tints alternate glow'd  But groves no further fenc'd the devious way  A wideextended heath before him lay  v  Various BirdsTheir song and appearance  Where on the grass the stagnant shower had run  And shone a mirror to the rising sun  Thus doubly seen lighting a distant wood  Giving new life to each expanding bud  Effacing quick the dewy footmarks found  Where prowling Reynard trod his nightly round  To shun whose thefts 'twas Giles's evening care  His feather'd victims to suspend in air  High on the bough that nodded o'er his head  And thus each morn to strew the field with dead  His simple errand done he homeward hies  Another instantly its place supplies  The clatt'ring dairymaid immers'd in steam  Singing and scrubbing midst her milk and cream  Bawls out  "Go fetch the cows"  he hears no more  For pigs and ducks and turkies throng the door  And sitting hens for constant war prepar'd  A concert strange to that which late he heard  Bringing in of Cows to be milked  v  Straight to the meadow then he whistling goes  With wellknown halloo calls his lazy cows  Down the rich pasture heedlessly they graze  Or hear the summon with an idle gaze  For well they know the cowyard yields no more  Its tempting fragrance nor its wint'ry store  Reluctance marks their steps sedate and slow  The right of conquest all the law they know  Subordinate they one by one succeed  And one among them always takes the lead  Is ever foremost wheresoe'er they stray  Allow'd precedence undisputed sway  With jealous pride her station is maintain'd  For many a broil that post of honour gain'd  At home the yard affords a grateful scene  For Spring makes e'en a miry cowyard clean  Thence from its chalky bed behold convey'd  The rich manure that drenching winter made  v  Order of the Cows returning  Which pil'd near home grows green with many a weed  A promis'd nutriment for Autumn's seed  Forth comes the Maid and like the morning smiles  The Mistress too and follow'd close by Giles  A friendly tripod forms their humble seat  With pails bright scour'd and delicately sweet  Where shadowing elms obstruct the morning ray  Begins their work begins the simple lay  The fullcharg'd udder yields its willing streams  While  Mary  sings some lover's amorous dreams  And crouching  Giles  beneath a neighbouring tree  Tugs o'er his pail and chants with equal glee  Whose hat with tatter'd brim of knap so bare  From the cow's side purloins a coat of hair  A mottled ensign of his harmless trade  An unambitious peaceable cockade  As unambitious too that cheerful aid  The mistress yields beside her rosy maid  Milking  v  With joy she views her plenteous reeking store  And bears a brimmer to the dairy door  Her cows dismiss'd the luscious mead to roam  Till eve again recall them loaded home  And now the DAIRY claims her choicest care  And half her household find employment there  Slow rolls the churn its load of clogging cream  At once foregoes its quality and name  From knotty particles first floating wide  Congealing butter's dash'd from side to side  Streams of new milk through flowing coolers stray  And snowwhite curd abounds and wholesome whey  Due north th' unglazed windows cold and clear  For warning sunbeams are unwelcome here  Brisk goes the work beneath each busy hand  And  Giles  must trudge whoever gives command  A  Gibeonite  that serves them all by turns  He drains the pump from him the faggot burns  v  The Dairy  From him the noisy hogs demand their food  While at his heels run many a chirping brood  Or down his path in expectation stand  With equal claims upon his strewing hand  Thus wastes the morn till each still pleasure sees  The bustle o'er and press'd the newmade cheese  Unrivall'd stands thy country CHEESE o  Giles  Whose very name alone engenders smiles  Whose fame abroad by every tongue is spoke  The wellknown butt of many a flinty joke  That pass like current coin the nation through  And ah experience proves the satire true  Provision's grave thou ever craving mart  Dependant huge Metropolis where Art  Her poring thousands stows in

pleasure and to play  Indulg'd through every field by turns to range  And taste them all in one continual change  For through luxuriant their grassy food  Sheep long confin'd but loathe the present

pour along  Giles  round their boundaries takes his usual stroll  Sees every pass secur'd and fences whole  High fences pround to charm the gazing eye  Where many a nestling first assays to fly  Where blows the woodbine faintly streak'd with red  And rests on every bough its tender head  Round the young ash its twining branches meet  Or crown the hawthorn with its odours sweet  Say ye that know ye who have felt and seen  Spring  's morning smiles and soulenliv'ning green  Say did you give the thrilling transport way  Did your eye brighten when young lambs at play  Leap'd o'er your path with animated pride  Or gaz'd in merry clusters by your side  Lambs at play  v  Ye who can smile to wisdom no disgrace  At the arch meaning of a kitten's face  If spotless innocence and infant mirth  Excites to praise or gives reflection birth  In shades like these pursue your fav'rite joy  Midst Nature's revels sports that never cloy  A few begin a short but vigorous race  And indolence abash'd soon flies the place  Thus challeng'd forth see thither one by one  From every side assembling playmates run  A thousand wily anties mark their stay  A starting crowd impatient of delay  Like the fond dove from fearful prison freed  Each seems to say "Come let us try our speed"  Away they scour impetuous ardent strong  The green turf trembling as they bound along  Adown the slope then up the hillock climb  Where every molehill is a bed of thyme  v  Lambs at play  There panting stop yet scarcely can refrain  A bird a leaf will set them off again  Or if a gale with strength unusual blow  Scatt'ring the wildbrier roses into snow  Their little limbs increasing efforts try  Like the torn flower the fair assemblage fly  Ah fallen rose sad emblem of their doom  Frail as thyself they perish while they bloom  Though unoffending innocence may plead  Though frantic ewes may mourn the savage deed  Their shepherd comes a messenger of blood  And drives them bleating from their sports and food  Care loads his brow and pity wrings his heart  For lo the murd'ring BUTCHER with his cart  Demands the firstlings of his flock to die  And makes a sport of life and liberty  His gay companions  Giles

c Labours of the barn The gander Night a thunder storm Harvesthome Reflections c  SUMMER  II  THE FARMER'S life displays in every part  A moral lesson to the sensual heart  Though in the lap of Plenty thoughtful still  He looks beyond the present good or ill  Nor estimates alone one blessing's worth  From changeful seasons or capricious earth  But views the future with the present hours  And looks for failures as he looks for show'er  For casual as for certain want prepares  And round his yard the reeking haystack rears  Or clover blossom'd lovely to the sight  His team's rich store through many a wint'ry night  What though abundance round his dwelling spreads  Though ever moist his selfimproving meads  Supply his dairy with a copious flood  And seem to promise unexhausted food  That promise fails when buried deep in snow  And vegetative juices cease to flow  For this his plough turns up the destin'd lands  Whence stormy Winter draws its full demands  For this the seed minutely small he sows  Whence sound and sweet the hardy turnip grows  But how unlike to APRIL'S closing days  High climbs the Sun and darts his pow'rful rays  Whitens the freshdrawn mould and pierces through  The cumb'rous clods that tumble round the plough  O'er heaven's bright azure hence with joyful eyes  The Farmer sees dark clouds assembling rise  Provident turn of the Farmer's mind  v  Borne o'er his fields a heavy torrent falls  And strikes the earth in hasty driving squalls  "Right welcome down ye precious drops"  he cries  But soon too soon the partial blessing flies  "Boy bring thy harrows try how deep the rain  Has fore'd its way"  He comes but comes in vain  Dry dust beneath the bubbling surface lurks  And mocks his pains the more the more he works  Still midst huge clods he plunges on forlorn  That laugh his harrows and the shower to scorn  E'en thus the living clod the stubborn fool  Resists the stormy lectures of the school  Till tried with gentler means the dunce to please  His head imbibes right reason by degrees  As when from eve till morning's wakeful hour  Light constant rain evinces secret pow'r  And ere the day resume its wouted smiles  Presents a cheerful easy task for  Giles  v  Showers softening the soil  Down with a touch the mellow'd soil is laid  And you tall crop next claims his timely aid  Thither well pleas'd he hies assur'd to find  Wild trackless haunts and objects to his mind  Shot up from broad rank blades that droop below  The nodding WHEATEAR forms a graceful bow  With milky kernels starting full weigh'd down  Ere yet the sun hath ting'd its head with brown  Whilst thousands in a flock for every gay  Loud chirping  sparrows  welcome on the day  And from the mazes of the leafy thorn  Drop one by one upon the bending corn  Giles with a pole assails their close retreats  And round the grassgrown dewy border beats  On either side completely overspread  Here branches bend there corn o'ertops his head  Green covert hail for through the varying year  No hours so sweet no scene to him so dear  Green CornSparrows  v  Here  Wisdom  's placid eye delighted sees  His frequent intervals of lonely case  And with one ray his infant soul inspires  Just kindling there her neverdying fires  Whence solitude derives peculiar charms  And heavendirected thought his bosom warms  Just where the parting bough's light shadows play  Scarce in the shade nor in the scorching day  Stretch'd on the turf he lies a peopled bed  Where swarming insects creep around his head  The small dustcolour'd beetle climbs with pain  O'er the smooth plantainleaf a spacious plain  Thence higher still by countless steps convey'd  He gains the summit of a shiv'ring blade  And flirts his filmy wings and looks around  Exulting in his distance from the ground  The tender speckled moth here dancing seen  The vaulting grasshopper of glossy green  v  Sceneryfull of life and inspiring contemplation  And all prolific  Summer  's sporting train  Their little lives by various pow'rs sustain  But what can unassisted vision do  What but recoil where most it would pursue  His patient gaze but finish with a sigh  When music waking speaks the  skylark  nigh  Just starting from the corn she cheerly sings  And trusts with conscious pride her downy wings  Still louder breathes and in the face of day  Mounts up and calls on  Giles  to mark her way  Close to his eyes his hat he instant bends  And forms a friendly telescope▪ that lends  Just aid enough to dull the glaring light  And place the wand'ing bird before his sight  Yet oft beneath a cloud she sweeps along  Lost for awhile yet pours her varied song  He views the spot and as the cloud moves by  Again she stretches up the clear blue sky  The Skylard  v  Her form her motion undistinguish'd quite  Save when she wheels direct from shade to light  The flutt'ring songstress a mere speck became  Like fancy's floating bubbles in a dream  He sees her yet but yielding to repose  Unwittingly his jaded eyelids close  Delicious sleep From sleep who could forbear  With no more guilt than  Giles  and no more care  Peace o'er his slumbers waves her guardian wing  Nor conscience once disturbs him with a sting  He wakes refresh'd from every trivial pain  And takes his pole and brushes round again  Its darkgreen hue its sicklier tints all fail  And rip'ening harvest rustles in the gale  A glorious sight if glory dwells below  Where Heaven's munificence makes all the show  O'er every field and golden prospect found  That glads the ploughman's Sunday morning's round  v  SkylarkCorn ripening  When on some eminence he takes his stand  To judge the smiling produce of the land  Here Vanity slinks back her head to hide  What is there here to flatter human pride  The tow'ring fabric or the dome's loud roar  And stedfast columns may astonish more  Where the charm'd gazer long delighted stays  Yet trac'd but to the  architect  the praise  Whilst here the veriest clown that treads the sod  Without one scruple gives the praise to GOD  And twofold joys possess his raptur'd mind  From gratitude and admiration join'd  Here midst the boldest triumphs of her worth  NATURE herself invites the REAPERS forth  Dares the keen sickle from its twelvemonth's rest  And gives that ardour which in every breast  From infancy to age alike appears  When the first sheaf its plumy top uprears

ready group attendant on his word  To turn the swarth the quiv'ring load to rear  Or ply the busy rake the land to clear  Summer's light garb itself now cumb'rous grown  Each his thin doublet in the shade throws down  Where oft the mastiff sculks with halfshut eye  And rouses at the stranger passing by  Whilst unrestrain'd the social converse flows  And every breast Love's pow'rful impulse knows  And rival wits with more than rustic grace  Confess the presence of a pretty face  For lo encircled there the lovely MAID  In youth's own bloom and native smiles array'd  Her hat awry divested of her

glowing cheek  Now noon gone by and four declining hours  The weary limbs relax their boasted pow'rs  Thirst rages strong the fainting spirits fail  And ask the sov'reign cordial homebrew'd ale  Beneath some shelt'ring heap of yellow corn  Rests the hoop'd keg and friendly cooling horn  That mocks alike the goblet's brittle frame  Its costlier potions and its nobler name  To  Mary  first the

and early snow  Might bring home's comforts fresh before his eyes  No sooner thought than see the structure rise  In some sequester'd nook embank'd around  Sods for its walls and straw in burdens bound  The Hut  v  Dried fuel hoarded is his richest store  And circling smoke obscures his little door  Whence creeping forth to duty's call he yields  And strolls the Crusoe of the lonely fields  On whitethorns tow'ring and the leafless rose  A frostnipt feast in bright vermilion glows  Where clust'ring sloes in glossy order rise  He crops the loaded branch a cumb'rous prize  And o'er the flame the sputt'ring fruit he rests  Placing green sods to seat his coming guests  His guests by promise playmates young and gay  BUT AH  fresh pastimes  lure their steps away  He sweeps his hearth and homeward looks in vain  Till feeling  Disappointment's  cruel pain  His fairy revels are exchang'd for rage  His banquet marr'd grown dull his hermitage  The field becomes his prison till on high  Benighted birds to shades and coverts fly  v  The pleasures of the Hut  Midst air health daylight can he prisoner be  If fields are prisons where is Liberty  Here still she dwells and here her votaries stroll  But disappointed hope untunes the soul  Restraints unfelt whilst hours of rapture flow  When troubles press to chains and barriers grow  Look then from trivial up to greater woes  From the poor birdboy with his roasted sloes  To where the dungeon'd mourner heaves the sigh  Where not one cheering sunbeam meets his eye  Though ineffectual pity thine may be  No wealth no pow'r to set the captive free  Though  only  to thy ravish'd  sight  is given  The golden path that HOWARD trod to heaven  Thy slights can make the wretched more forlorn  And deeper drive affliction's barbed thorn  Say not "I'll come and cheer thy gloomy cell  With news of dearest friends how good how well  The Disappointment  v  I'll be a joyful herald to thine heart"  Then fail and play the worthless trifler's part  To sip flat pleasures from thy glass's brim  And waste the precious hour that's due to him  In mercy spare the base unmanly blow  Where can he turn to whom complain of you  Back to past joys in vain his thoughts may stray  Trace and retrace the beaten wornout way  The rankling injury will pierce his breast  And curses on thee break his midnight rest  Bereft of song and ever cheering green  The soft endearments of the Summer scene  New harmony pervades the solemn wood  Dear to the soul and healthful to the blood  For bold exertion follows on the sound  Of distant sportsmen and the chiding hound  First heard from kennel bursting mad with joy  Where smiling EUSTON boasts her good FITZROY  v  The cruelty of disappointing expectation  Lord of pure alms and gifts that wide extend  The farmer's patron and the poor man's friend  Whose mansion glitt'ring with the eastern ray  Whose elevated temple points the way  O'er slopes and lawns the park's extensive pride  To where the victims of the chace reside  Ingulf'd in earth in conscious safety warm  Till lo a plot portends their coming harm  In earliest hours of dark unhooded morn  Ere yet one rosy cloud bespeaks the dawn  Whilst far abroad THE FOX pursues his prey  He's doom'd to risk the perils of the day  From his strong hold block'd out perhaps to bleed  Or owe his life to fortune or to speed  For

The loit'ring sportsman feels th' instinctive flame  And checks his steed to mark the springing game  Midst intersecting cuts and winding ways  The huntsman cheers his dogs and anxious strays  Where every narrow riding even shorn  Gives back the echo of his mellow horn  Till fresh and lightsome every power untried  The starting fugitive leaps by his side  His lifted finger to his ear he plies  And the view halloo bids a chorus rise  Of dogs quickmouth'd and shouts that mingle loud  As bursting thunder rolls from cloud to cloud  With ears cropt short and chest of vig'rous mould  O'er ditch o'er fence unconquerably bold  The shining courser lengthens every bound  And his strong footlocks suck the moisten'd groud  As from the confines of the wood they pour  And joyous villages partake the roar  v  The subject continued  O'er heath far stretch'd or down or valley low  The stifflimb'd peasant glorying in the show  Pursues in vain where youth itself soon tires  Spite of the transports that the chace inspires  For who unmounted long can charm the eye  Or hear the music of the leading cry  Poor faithful TROUNCER thou canst lead no more  All thy fatigues and all thy triumphs o'er  Triumphs of worth whose honorary fame  Was still to follow true the hunted game  Beneath enormous oaks Britannia's boast  In thick impenetrable coverts lost  When the warm pack in fault'ring silence stood  Thine was the note that rous'd the list'ning wood  Rekindling every joy with tenfold force  Through all the mazes of the tainted course  Still foremost thou the dashing stream to cross  And tempt along the animated horse  The Foxhound  v  Foremost o'er fen or level mead to pass  And sweep the show'ring dewdrops from the grass  Then bright emerging from the mist below  To climb the woodland hill's exulting brow  Pride of thy race with worth far less than thine  Full many human leaders daily shine  Less faith less constaney less gen'rous zeal  Then no disgrace mine humble verse shall feel  Where not one lying line to rihes bows  Or poison'd sentiment from rancour flows  Nor flowers are strewn around Ambition's car  An honest dog's a nobler theme by far  Each sportsman heard the tidings with a sigh  When Death's cold touch had stopt his tuneful cry  And though high deeds and fair exalted praise  In memory liv'd and flow'd in rustic lays  Short was the strain of monumental

And many a clamorous Hen and cockrel gay  When daylight slowly through the fog breaks way  Fly wantonly abroad but ah how soon  The shades of twilight follow hazy noon  Short'ning the busy dayday that

Sharing alike our weariness and rest  Who lives the daily partner of our hours  Through every change of heat and frost and show'rs  Partakes our cheerful meals partaking first  In mutual labour and in mutual thirst  The kindly intercourse will ever prove  A bond of amity and social love  To more than man this generous warmth extends  And oft the team and shiv'ring herd befriends  Tender solicitude the bosom fills  And Pity executes what Reason wills  Youth learns compassion's tale from every tongue  And flies to aid the helpless and the young  When now unsparing as the scourge of war  Blasts follow blasts and groves dismantled roar  Around their home the stormpinch'd CATTLE lows  No nourishment in frozen pastures grows  Yet frozen pastures every morn resound  With fair abundance thund'ring to the ground  For though on hoary twigs no buds peep out  And e'en the hardy bramble cease to sprout  Beneath dread WINTER'S level sheets of snow  The sweet nutritions  Turnip  deigns to grow  Till now imperious want and widespread dearth  Bid Labour claim her treasures from the earth  Benevolence springing from mutual sufferings and pleasures  v  On GILES and such as Giles the labour falls  To strew the frequent load where hungner calls  On driving gales sharp hail indignant flies  And sleet more irksome still assails his eyes  Snow clogs his feet or if no snow is seen  The field with all its juicy store to screen  Deep goes the frost till every root is found  A rolling mass of ice upon the ground  No tender ewe can break her nightly fast  Nor heifer strong begin the cold repast  Till  Giles  with pond'rous beetle foremost go  And scatt'ring splinters fly at every blow  When pressing round him eager for the prize  From their mixt breath warm exhalations rise  If now in beaded rows drops deck the spray  While  Phoebus  grants a momentary ray  Let but a cloud's broad shadow intervence  And stiffen'd into gems the drops are seen  v  Ice broken and snow cleared for the cattle  And down the furrow'd oak's broad southern side  Streams of dissolving rime no longer glide  THOUGH NIGHT approaching bids for rest prepare  Still the flail echoes throught the frosty air  Nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come  Sending at length the weary laborer home  From him with bed and nightly food supplied  Throughout the yeard hous'd round on every side  Deepplunging Cows their rustling feast enjoy  And snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing boy  Who moves unseen beneath his trailing load  Fills the tall racks and leaves a scatter'd road  Where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry  Bolt out and scamper headlong to their sty  When  Giles  with wellknown voice already there  Deigns them a portion of his evening care  Him  though the cold may pierce and storms molest  Succeedign hours shall cheer with warmth and rest  Night  v  Gladness to spread and raise the grateful smile  He hurls the faggot bursting from the pile  And many a log and rifted trunk conveys  To heap the fire and to extend the blaze  That quiv'ring strong through every opening flies  Whilst smoaky columns unobstructed rise  For the rude architect unknown to fame  Nor symmetry nor elegance his aim  Who spread his floors of solid oak on high  On beams roughhewn from age to age that lie  Bade his  wide Fabric  unimpair'd sustain  Pomona's  store and cheese and golden grain  Bade from its central base capacious laid  The wellwrought chimney rear its lofty head  Where since hath many a savoury ham been stor'd  And tempests howl'd and Christmas gambols roar'd  FLAT on the  hearth  the glowing embers lie  And flames reflected dance in every eye  v  Christmas Fire  There the long billet forc'd at last to bend  While frothing sap gushes at either end  Throws round its welcome heatthe ploughman smiles  And oft the joke runs hard on sheepish  Giles  Who sits joint tenant of the cornerstool  The converse sharing though in duty's school  For now attentively 'tis his to hear  Interrogations from the Master's chair  'LIFT ye your bleating charge when daylight fled  'Near where the haystack lifts its snowy head  'Whose fence of bushy furze so close and warm  'May stop the slanting bullets of the storm  'For hark it blows a dark and dismal night  'Heaven guide the trav'eller's fearful steps aright  'Now from the woods mistrustful and sharpey'd  'The  Fox  in silent darkness seems to glide  'Stealing around us list'ning as he goes  'If chance the Cock or stamm'ring capon crows  Conversation  v  'Or Goose or nodding Duck should darkling cry  'As if appriz'd of lurking danger night  'Destruction waits them  Giles  if e'er you fail  'To bolt their doors against the driving gale  'Strew'd you still mindful of the unshelter'd head  'Burdens of straw the cattle's welcome bed  'Thine heart should feel what thou may'st hourly see  '  That duty's basis is humanity  'Of pain's unsavoury cup though thou may'st taste  'The wrath of Winter from the bleak northeast  ' Thine utmost suff'rings in the coldest day  'A period terminates and joys repay  Perhaps e'en now whilst her those joys we boast  'Full many a bark rides down the neighb'ring coast  Where the high northern waves tremendous roar  'Drove down by blasts from  Norway's  icy shore  'The  Seaboy  there less fortunate than thou  'Feels all thy pains in all the gusts that blow  v  Contrast between the inconvenience at Land and a Seastorm  His freezing hands now drench'd now dry by turns  'Now lost now seen the distant light that burns  'On some tall cliff uprais'd a flaming guide  'That throws its friendly radiance o'er the tide  'His labours cease not with declining day  'But toils and perils mark his watry way  'And whilst in peaceful dreams secure  we  lie  'The ruthless whirlwinds rage along the sky  'Round his head whistlingand shalt thou repine  'Whilst this protecting roof still shelters thine'  Mild as the vernal show'r his words prevail  And aid the moral precept of his tale  His wond'ring hearers learn and ever keep  These first ideas of the reatless deep  And as the opening mind a circuit tries  Present felicities in value rise  Increasing pleasures every hour they find  The warmth more precious and he shelter kind  Effect of the Farmer's kind admonitions v  Warmth that long reigning bids the eyelids close  As through the blood its balmy influence goes  When the cheer'd heart forgets fatigues and cares  And drowsiness alone dominion bears  Sweet then the ploughman's slumbers hale and young  When the last topic dies upon his tongue  Sweet then the bliss his transient dreams inspire  Till chilblains wake him or the snapping fire  He starts and ever thoughtful of his team  Along the glitt'ring snow a feeble gleam  Shoots from his lantern as he yawning goes  To add fresh comforts to their night's repose  Diffusing fragrance as their food he moves  And pats the jolly sides of those he loves  Thus full replenish'd perfect ease possest  From might till morn alternate food and rest  No rightful cheer withheld no sleep debar'd  Their each day's labour brings its sure reward  v Sleeprenewed labour  Yet when from plough or lumb'ring cart set free  They taste awhile the sweets of liberty  E'en sober  Dobbin  lifts his clumsy heels  And kicks disdainful of the dirty wheels  But soon his frolic ended yields again  To trudge the road and wear the clinking chain  Shortsighted DOBBINthou canst only see  The trivial hardships that  encompass  thee  Thy chains were freedom and thy toils repose  Could the poor  posthorse  tell thee all his woes  Shew thee his bleeding shoulders and unfold  The dreadful anguish he endures for gold  ir'd at each call of business lust or rage  That prompt the trav'eller on from stage to stage  Still on  his  strength depends their boasted speed  For them his limbs grow weak his bare ribs bleed  And though he groaning quickens at command  Their extra shilling in the rider's hand  The Farmer's and Posthorse contrasted  v  Becomes his bitter scourge'tis  he  must feel  The double efforts of the lash and steel  Till when uphill the destin'd inn he gains  And trembling under complicated pains  Prone from his nostrils darting on the ground  His breath emitted floats in clouds around  Drops chase each other down his chest and sides  And spatter'd mud his native colour hides  Through his swoln veins the boiling torrent flows  And every nerve a separate torture knows  His harness loos'd he welcomes eagereyed  The pail's full draught that quivers by his side  And joys to see the wellknown stable door  As the starv'd mariner the friendly shore  Ah well for him if here his suff'rings ceas'd  And ample hours of rest his pains appeas'd  But rous'd again and sternly bade to rise  And shake refreshing slumber from his eyes  v  The sufferings of the Posthorse continued  Ere his exhausted spirits can return  Or through his frame reviving ardour burn  Come forth he must though limping maim'd and sore  He hears the whip the chaise is at the door  The collar tightens and again he feels  His halfheal'd wounds inflam'd again the wheels  With tiresome sameness in his ears resound  O'er blinding dust or miles of flinty ground  Thus nightly robb'd and injur'd day by day  His piecemeal murd'rers wear his life away  What say'st thou  Dobbin  what though hounds await  With open jaws the moment of thy fate  No better fate attends  his  public race  His life is misery and his end disgrace  Then freely bear thy burden to the mill  Obey but one short lawthy driver's will  Affection to thy memory ever true  Shall boast of mighty loads that  Dobbin  drew  Patience recommended from comparison v  And back to childhood shall the mind with pride  Recount thy gentleness in many a ride  To pond or field or village fair when thou  Held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow  And oft the Tale shall rise to homely fame  Upon thy gen'rous spirit and thy name  Though faithful to a proverb we regard  The midnight chieftain of the farmer's yard  Beneath whose guardianship all hearts rejoice  Woke by the echo of his hollow voice  Yet as the Hound may fault'ring quit the pack  Snuff the foul scent and hasten yelping back  And e'en the docile Pointer know disgrace  Thwarting the gen'ral instinct of his race  E'en so the MASTIFF or the meaner Cur  At times will from the path of duty err  A pattern of fidelity by day  By night a  murderer  lurking for his prey  v  The Mastiff  And round the pastures or the fold will creep  And cowardlike attack the peaceful sheep  Alone the wanton mischief he pursues  Alone in reeking blood his jaws embrues  Chasing amain his fright'ned victims round  Till death in wild confusion strews the ground  Then wearied out to kennel sneaks away  And licks his guilty paws till break of day  The deed discover'd and the news once spread  Vengeance hangs o'er the unknown culprit's head  And careful  Shepherds  extra hours bestow  In patient  watchings  for the common foe  A foe most dreaded now when rest and peace  Should wait the season of the flock's increase  In part these nightly terrors to dispel  GILES ere he sleeps his little Flock must tell  From the fireside with many a shrug he hies  Glad if the fullorb'd Moon salute his eyes  A Sheep  i  er by night  v  And through the unbroken stillness of the night  Shed on his path her beams of cheering light  With saunt'ring step he climbs the distant stile  Whilst all around him wears a placid smile  There views the whiterob'd clouds in clusters driv'n  And all the glorious pageantry of heav'n  Low on the utmost bound'ry of the sight  The rising vapours catch the silver light  Thence Fancy measures as they parting fly  Which first will throw its shadow on they eye  Passing the source of light and thence away  Succeeded quick by brighter still than they  For yet above these wafted clouds are seen  In a remoter sky still more serene  Others detach'd in ranges through the air  Spotless as snow and countless as they're fair  Scatter'd immensely wide from east to west  The beauteous semblance of a  Flock  at rest  v  Moonlightscattered clouds  These to the raptur'd mind aloud proclaim  Their MIGHTY SHEPHERD'S everlasting Name  Whilst thus the loit'rer's utmost stretch of soul  Climbs the still clouds or passes those that roll  And loos'd  Imagination  soaring goes  High o'er his home and all his little woes  TIME glides away neglected Duty calls  At once from plainss of light to earth he falls  And down a narrow lane well known by day  With all his speed pursues his sounding way  In thought still half absorb'd and chill'd with cold  When lo an object frightful to behold  A grisly SPECTRE cloth'd in silvergrey  Around whose feet the waving shadows play  Stands in his pathHe stops and not a breath  Heaves from his heart that sinks almost to death  Loud the owl halloos o'er his head unseen  All else is silent dismally serene  The Spectre  v  Some prompt ejaculation whisper'd low  Yet bears him up against the threat'ning foe  And thus poor Giles though half inclin'd to fly  Mutters his doubts and strains his stedfast eye  'Tis not my crimes thou com'st here to reprove  'No murders stain my soul no perjur'd love  'If thou'rt indeed what here thou seem'st to be  'Thy dreadful mission cannot reach to me  'By parents taught still to mistrust mine eyes  'Still to approach each object of surprise  'Lest Fancy's formful visions should deceive  'In moonlight paths or glooms of falling eve  'This then's the moment when my heart should try  'To scan thy motionless deformity  'But oh the fearful task yet well I know  'An aged ash with many a spreading bough  'Beneath whose leaves I've found a Summer's bow'r  'Beneath whose trunk I've weather'd many a show'r  v  The Explanation  'Stands singly down this solitary way  'But far beyond where now my footsteps stay  'Tis true thus far I've come with heedless haste  'No reck'ning kept no passing objects trac'd  'And can I then have reach'd that very tree  'Or is its reverend form assum'd by thee'  The happy thought alleviates his pain  He creeps another step then stops again  Till slowly as his noiseless feet draw near  Its perfect lineaments at once appear  Its crown of shiv'ring ivy whispering peace  And its white bark that fronts the moon's pale face  Now whilst his blood mounts upward now he knows  The solid gain that from conviction flows  And strengthen'd Confidence shall hence fulfill  With conscious Innocence more valued still  The dreariest task that winter nights can bring  By churchyard dark or grove or fairy ring  The terrors of surprise vanish on the use of recollection  v  Still buoying up the timid mind of youth  Till loit'ring Reason hoists the scale of Truth  With these blest guardians  Giles  his course pursues  Till numbering his heavysided ewes  Surrounding stillness tranquilize his breast  And shape the dreams that wait his hours of rest  As when retreating tempests we behold  Whose skirts at length the azure sky unfold  And full of murmurings and mingled wrath  Slowly unshroud the smiling face of earth  Bringing the bosom joy so WINTER flies  And see the Source of Life and Light uprise  A height'ning arch o'er southern hills he bends  Warm on the cheek the slanting beam descends  And gives the reeking mead a brighter hue  And draws the modest  primrose  bud to view  Yet frosts succeed and winds impetuous rush  And hailstorms rattle through the budding bush  v  Counting of the Sheep in the fold  And nightfall'n LAMBS require the shepherd's care  And teeming EWES that still their burdens bear  Beneath whose sides tomorrow's dawn may see  The milkwhite strangers bow the trembling knee  At whose first birth the pow'rful instinct's seen  That fills with champions the daisied green  For ewes that stood aloof with fearful eye  With stamping foot now men and dogs defy  And obstinately faithful to their young  Guard their first steps to join the bleating throng  But casualties and death from damps and cold  Will still attend the wellconducted fold  Her tender offspring dead the dam aloud  Calls and runs wild amidst the unconscious crowd  And orphan'd sucklings raise the piteous cry  No wool to warm them no defenders nigh  And must her streaming milk then flow in vain  Must unregarded innocence

imperfect state of sublunary happiness which is compartive at best there are not perhaps many nations existing whose situatinon is so desirable where the means of subsistence are so easy and the wants of the people so fewThe evident distinction of ranks which subsists at  Otahcite  does not so materially affect the felicity of the nation as we might have supposed The simplicity of their whole life contributes to soften the appearance of distinctions and to reduce them to a level Where the climate and the custom of the country do not absolutely require a perfect garment where it is easy at very step to gather as many plants as form not only a decent but likewise a customary covering and where all the nece  aries of life are within the reach of every individual at the expence of a trifting laboarambition and envy must in a great measure be unknown It is true the highest classes of people possess some dainty articles such as pork fish fowl and cloth almost exclusively but the desire of indulging the appetite in a few tr  g luxuries can at most render individuals and not whole nations unhappy Absolute want occasions the miseries of the lower class in some civilized states and is the result of the unbounded voluptuousness of their superiors At  Otahcite  there is not in general that disparity between the highest and the meanest  man that subjecst in England between a reputable tradesman and a laboures The affection of the Otaheitans for their chiefs which they never failed to express upon all occasions gave us great reason to suppose that they consider themselves as one family and respect their eldest born in the persons of their chiefs The lowest man in the nation speaks as freely with his kings as with his equal and has the pleasure of seeing him as often as he likes The king at time amu  es himself with the occupations of his subjects and not yet depraved by false notions of empty state he often paddles his own canoe without considering such an employment derogatory to his dignity How long such an happy equality may last is uncertain and how much the introduction of foreign luxuries may hasten its dissolution cannot be too frequently repeated to Europeans If the knowledge of a few individuals can only be acquired at such a price as the happiness of nations it were better for the discoverers and the discovered that the  South Sea  had still remained unknown to  Europe  and its restless inhabitants"  REFLECTIONS ON OTAHEITT Cook's second Voyage  THE END  ELEGANT PUBLICATIONS PRINTED FOR AND SOLD BY  VERNOR AND HOOD  THE ANATOMY OF
