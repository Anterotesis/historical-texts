Duke in a Rage confines his Daughter in a Tower and banishes  Valentiné  from  Milan  Protheus  he employs to plead for  Thurio  to his Daughter who by that Means getting Access to her declares his own Passion and is repulsed with Disdain  Julia  ignorant of her Lover's Falshood and impatient of his Absence disguises herself in the Habit of a Page and travels to  Milan  there she lodges at the same Inn where her Lover does and is informed by the Host that  Protheus  was in love with the Duke's Daughter to whom that Night in  Thurio  's Name he gives a Serenade  Julia  is present at the

with Contempt which so displeases the Duke who declares he is charmed with the Spirit and Constancy of  Valentine  that he bestows her upon him and pardoning the Outlaws at his Request they all return to  Milan  to celebrate the double Nuptials  Part of the Plot of this Play is taken from the Story of  Felismena  in the Second Book of the  Diana  of  George Montemayor  a Pastoral Romance translated from the  Spanish  in  Shakespear  's time the Loves of  Protheus  and  Julia  in the Play their Characters and Adventures are the same with those of  Felix  and  Felismena  in this Romance whose History is thus introduced  Three Nymphs dedicated to the Service of  Diana  straying too far from the Temple of that Goddess in which they resided are met in the Woods by as many savage Men who struck with their Beauty attempted to carry them away by force their Cries drew a young Shepherdess to their Assistance who being armed with a Bow and Quiver shot her Arrows so successfully at the Ravishers that in a few Moments she laid them all breathless at  her Feet and delivered the Nymphs from the Danger that threatened them Her uncommon Beauty the Dignity of her Mien but above all her surprising Valour persuaded the Nymphs she was some Goddess who had descended from Heaven to save them from Dishonour  Full of this Idea they threw themselves at her Feet and addressing her as a Divinity return Thanks for the Assistance she had vouchsafed them The Shepherdess raising them from the Ground assured them with Tears that she was no Goddess but a mere Woman and one of the weakest of her Sex undone by Love and sinking under the Oppression of the most cruel Fortune  The Nymphs moved by Compassion and a grateful Sense of the Obligation they owed her endeavoured to sooth her sorrow pressed her to relate her Story and promised her their Assistance The Shepherdess being willing to gratify their friendly Curiosity they seated themselves on the Banks of a Rivulet that ran murmuring by them when she thus began her Story  "Know fair Nymphs of the chaste Goddess that my native Country is  Vandalia  a Province not far hence my Father  Andronius  eminent for his Birth his Riches and above all for the native Sweetness and Integrity of his Manners was married very young to a Lady named  Delia  with whom he was passionately in love  Many Years elapsed before it pleased the Gods to bless them with a Child at length my Mother conceived in her old Age and one Night during her Pregnancy being discomposed with uneasy Apprehensions and unable to sleep she desired my Father to dissipate her Anxiety by reading some amusing Story to her My Father complied and read  The Judgment of  Paris  My Mother taking Occasion to moralize on this Story condemned the Partiality of the Shepherd's Sentence  Paris  said she being intoxicated with a sensual Passion for Beauty was incapable of considering as he ought the nobler Qualities of the Mind heroic Virtue is the brightest of them all and therefore the Goddess of Battles merited his Preference  The Contention was n  t for the Prize of Virtue but Beauty replied my Father the Apple was to be given to the fairest justly then did  Paris  bestow it upon  Venus  whose Charms were so greatly superior to those of her Competitors  The Apple was indeed inscribed to the fairest answered my Mother but that was not to be understood of corporeal but intellectual Beauty Fortitude being one of the chiefest Virtues of the Mind and the Exercise of Arms an exterior Act of this Virtue had  Paris  been a wise and dispassionate Judge he would have given the Apple to the Goddess of Battles  This Controversy lasted so long that my Mother being fatigued with talking fell fast asleep When lo the Goddess  Venus  appeared to her in a Dream shining with celestial Charms her Eyes expressed a certain Kind of amiable Severity for Anger could have no dwelling on the Face of this charming Divinity and with a Voice majestically sweet she thus accosted her  Whence  Delia  is this Contempt of a Power who has been always favourable to thee Hast thou forgot the Time when thy soft Heart first glowed with tender Fires for thy  Andronius  then didst thou seek my Altars then didst thou implore my Aid I heard and granted all thy Desires and is it thus thou repayest me but know ungrateful Woman thou shalt not escape the Vengeance of an affronted Deity thou shalt bring forth a Son and Daughter but thou shalt not live to taste the Joys of a Mother the Moment of their Birth shall be the last of thy Life nor shall my Vengeance stop here thy wretched Offspring shall feel the Fury of my just Resentment they both shall languish with the Pangs of hopeless Love and be the Victims of that Power thou hast dared to despise  The Goddess ended and vanished from her Sight when immediately the heavenly Form of  Jove's  own Daughter the Divine  Minerva  appeared before her awfully sweet she smiled and with a grave but melodious Accent thus spoke to her  The Goddess  Pallas  thanks thee  Delia  for the Concern thou hast expressed for her Honour and as a Reward she promises thee to make thy Son and Daughter so powerful in Arms that their Valour shall be the Wonder of their own and the Admiration of all future Ages"  This said she disappeared and my Mother trembling with holy Awe awaked  In less than a Month after she was delivered of me and a TwinBrother and as the Goddess threatened died immediately My Father sinking under an Excess of Sorrow for her Loss followed her in a few Months leaving my InfantBrother and myself to the Care of an Aunt who was Abbess of a Nunnery with her we lived 'till we were twelve Years old at which Age my Brother was carried to the Court of the King of  Portugal  where in a few Years the heroic Actions he performed in War gained him an immortal Glory which yet was not sufficient to compensate for the Pains he has endured in Love  As for myself I was removed from the Nunnery to the House of my Grandmother under whose Care I had hardly reached my seventeenth Year ere I was seen and to my Misfortune loved by the ungrateful  Felix  This young Nobleman having beheld me walking on a Terras which was behind my  Grandmother's House and not far distant from his he took all Opportunities to make his Passion known to me by ardent Looks which I not seeming to understand he determined to write to me and practised so successfully upon the easy yielding Temper of one of my Maids named  Rosina  that she undertook to deliver his Letter to me  The crafty Wench made use of a thousand little Artifices to induce me to receive this Letter and though I was not displeased with her Importunities yet assuming a Countenance as angry as I was able I told her sternly that were I not restrained by a Sense of what I owed my own Rank and the Fear of the World's Censure I would dismiss her from my Service with the Infamy her Presumption merited  Methinks I have the artful Girl this Moment before my Eyes cunningly dissembling the Grief and Confusion my Anger gave her with a counterfeited Smile  Believe me Madam said she I meant no more by pressing you to take this Letter than to make you laugh I did not imagine you would be offended but since contrary to my Expectations I find you are I will trouble you no more on this Subject saying this she put the Letter again into her Pocket and quitted my Chamber  Ah how eagerly did my straining By pursue her Steps I died with desire to see the Letter but Pride and Modesty that made me refuse it when she intreated me now joined with Shame to keep me from requiring it after the Anger I had affected  All that Day I continued pensive and uneasy at Night when  Rosina  attended me in my Chamber I waited with an anxious Impatience for a Renewal of that Discourse with which I had seemed so much displeased in the Morning but alas I was disappointed  Rosina  either was or appeared resolved to mention the Letter no more Yet to try if she would fasten upon any Occasion to offer it me again  And is it really so  Rosina  said I that Don  Felix  without having any Regard to my Honour dare presume to write to me  "Alas Madam said she demurely these Things will happen to young Ladies so lovely as you I am indeed concerned to find I have offended you by solliciting you to take his Letter but it was occasioned by my Ignorance of your Severity in these Matters but I beseech you pardon me for from this Moment I will never mention it to you again  This Steadiness cruelly mortified me yet did I dissemble my Uneasiness while she was present that Night seemed twice as long as usual full of a Thousand perplexing Thoughts I waited anxiously for Day without once closeing  my Eyes At length the Morning came and  Rosina  at her accustomed Hour attending me at my Toilet let fall the Letter near me and as I thought on Purpose which when I perceived what is that you have dropt said I she answered "it was nothing" but I insisted upon seeing what had fallen  Bless me Madam said she why should you be so desirous to see it it is the Letter I would have given you Yesterday  I don't believe you answered I therefore give it me that I may convict you of a Falshood immediately she put it into my Hands assuring me with an Emotion I knew to be feigned that it was no other  You deceive me cried I still dissembling it is a Letter to yourself from one of your Lovers and I am resolved to read it that I may judge if he deserves your Favour saying this I opened the Letter which as I expected was addressed from Don  Felix  to myself  The tender and passionate Sentiments it contained so wrought upon the native Softness of my Temper that I could not resist the Desire I felt to return an Answer to it that might give him Hopes of my future Favour I now asked Forgiveness of my Maid for the Severity I had assumed and wholly considing in her Truth and Affection I communicated the Contents of Don  Felix  's Letter  to her and begged her Assistance in conveying one to him this she readily promised and as faithfully performed  My Letter being calculated to give him Hope rather than Despair my Lover omitted nothing that might contribute towards settling me in a firm Opinion of his Passion every Day brought me a Letter or some passionate Verses every Evening a Serenade under my Chamber Window A whole Year rolled away in this Manner at length being firmly persuaded of the Truth and Ardency of his Affection I resolved to make myself by Promise hi  when oh my adverse Fortune the Father of Don  Felix  having received some Intimation of his Son's Passion for me to prevent his marrying me as he apprehended sent him away immediately to the Court of the Great Princess  Augusta Caesarina  telling him it was not fit a young Gentleman of his noble Extraction should spend his Youth at Home where Idleness and the Force of bad Examples might draw him into dangerous Vices  Don  Felix  could not resolve to acquaint me with this cruel News apprehensive that my extream Grief upon bearing it would affect him too deeply he departed without taking leave  Ah chaste and lovely Nymphs how shall I give you an Idea of the Pangs I suffered in his Absence Strangers as ye are to the sort Tyranny of Love how shall I make you  comprehend the Torments divided Lovers feel I found them so insupportable that forgetting what I owed my Sex my Rank and Fame I quitted my Grandmother's House and in the Disguise of a Page travelled to that Court where the dear Object of all my Wishes was  I was twenty Days in performing this journey during which time my Disguise exposed me to great Inconveniences but my eager Desire to see Don  Felix  made me despise them all At my Arrival I hired a Lodging in a Street less frequented than any other with Company My anxious Impatience to see Don Felix left me not room for any other Thoughts but how to gratify this Wish yet I durst not enquire for him of my Host lest my Flight being noised abroad my Sex and Condition might have been suspected nor did I think it prudent to venture out to seek him for fear I should be observed  All Day I passed in this Perplexity at length the Night approached and brought with it an Increase of my Affliction notwithstanding the Fatigue both of Body and Mind which I had endured yet I could take no Repose I tossed and tumbled on my uneasy Bed 'till Midnight when my Host knocking at my Chamber Door told me if I had any Inclination to hear some fine Music I had nothing to do but to rise and open the Window that lo  d towards t  e Street Ah me in the distracted State my Mind was then in I was  little capable of relishing Music however charming it might be yet did I rise without thinking on what I was doing and opening the Window my Attention was immediately engaged by the Sound of a Voice that seemed familiar to my Ears and listening eagerly I perceived it was  Fabius  a Page belonging to Don  Felix  who calling to some Persons at a little Distance said now my Masters it is time to begin for the Lady is come into the Gallery this Moment  Then immediately they began to play upon several Instruments which had I not been racked with a thousand various Thoughts might with the celestial Harmony they made have charmed me into an Extasy  The Music no sooner ceased than a Voice which by its ravishing Sweetness I knew to be Don  Felix  's sung some tender and passionate Verses in which he complained of the extream Rigour of a Lady to whom he had devoted his Affections  That well known Voice lulled me into such a sweet Delirium of Joy that forgetting those fatal Verses were addressed to another the Image of our past Loves rose fresh to my Remembrance and my deceitful Imagination represented my Lover as formerly breathing out those melting Sounds to me but this pleasing Delusion lasted not long I soon recovered to a Sense a bitter Sense of my deplorable Condition and turning to my Host I asked him  with a Sigh that shook my whole Frame if he knew the Lady for whose Sake that Music was performed  He answered he did not for there were so many fair and noble Ladies lived in that Street that it was not easy to discover to which of them it was addressed  Finding he could not satisfy me in this particular I lent my whole Attention again to the Voice of my unfaithful Lover but ah with different Sensations for now my Soul was filled with the most gloomy Despair The Morning dawn'd before this hateful Serenade was ended I withdrew again to my Bed and with a River of Tears bewailed my own Misfortune and the Inconstancy of Don  Felix  Great Part of the Day being wasted in this Manner I rose and putting on my Disguise went out of my Lodging wandering thro' the Streets without any determined Design yet anxiously wishing to see my perjured Lover  Chance brought me to the Gates of the Palace I entered a broad paved Court that was before it and beheld a great many Ladies young beautiful and richly adorned shewing themselves at the Windows to the young Noblemen who were riding backwards and forwards below and whose Eyes were differently directed as the Objects of their Desires were placed  While I continued standing near the PalaceGate in hopes of seeing Don  Felix  whose new Mistress I did not doubt was amongst the Ladies there I saw  Fabius  approach and after speaking a few Words to the Porter that kept the second Entry return the same Way he came my Heart beat with eager Expectation I imagined Don  Felix  was coming I was not deceived he came attended with several Servants all dressed in rich Liveries of yellow Velvet with white and blue Feathers in their Hats my Lover himself was drest with the utmost Exactness and wore Feathers of the same Colours in his Hat  As soon as he arrived at the PalaceGate he dismounted and went up the Stairs that led to the Chamber of Presence  The Extreams of Joy and Grief in which my Soul was tost at that transient View of him whom I so passionately loved and whose Falshood I so tenderly lamented kept me a long Time motionless in the Place where I stood  At last recovering myself a little I observed  Fabius  waiting his coming out with the rest of his Attendants and stepping up to him I drew him aside and asked him who that Nobleman was that had just entered the Palace"  Thou must beeds be a Stranger here replied he if thou knowest not Don  Felix  why  Youth I tell thee there is not any Nobleman in the Court better known than Don  Felix  It may be so said I but I am a Stranger and would be glad to be informed if he has any particular Reason for giving Liveries of these Colours  If it were not so well known replied he I would conceal it but since any other Person can acquaint thee with it as well as myself I'll tell thee the Reason he loves a Lady of this City named  Celia  and 'tis her Colours that he wears  My wounded Heart bled afresh at this Confirmation of my Unhappiness yet I dissembled my Emotion and continued talking to the Page about his Master's Passion from whom I gathered that the Lady did not receive it with any Marks of Kindness  This Assurance animated my drooping Spirits I pursued the Conversation and  Fabius  following the Custom of Pages very freely acquainted me with all his Master's Affairs from which making a quick Transition to mine he asked me my Name Country and Condition  I told him my Name was  Valerius  my Country  Vandalia  and that as yet I had served no Person  Fabius  being desirous as I was his Countryman to have me for a Fellowservant  told me that his Lord had ordered him to enquire for a Page for him and that he would recommend me provided it was agreeable to my Inclination this Proposal I immediately accepted as it afforded me the Means of seeing my Don  Felix  every Day  Fabius  having mentioned me to him he ordered my Attendance on him that Evening and being pleased with my Appearance hired me immediately Alas this Situation was productive of new Miseries for now I was a Witness a mournful Witness to the Messages Letters and Presents that were daily sent my Rival  "After I had been a Month in his Service Don  Felix  who had conceived an extraordinary Liking for me communicated to me the whole Story of his Passion for  Celia  and gave me a Letter for her which he charged me to deliver if possible into her own Hands Judge charming Nymphs if this Commission was not painful yet I undertook it and procuring an Audience of the Lady presented her the Letter  Celia  looking fixedly upon me received the Letter as it should seem without knowing what she did She blushed and grew pale alternately and not able for several Minutes to remove her Eyes from my Face she gazed on me with such a visible Emotion that I plainly perceived my Sight had caused some great Alteration in her Heart  Recovering herself at length she opened the Letter and hastily glancing it over threw it aside and again directed her Looks to me"  Fortune said she after a little Pause has been very favourable to Don  Felix  in bringing thee to this Court to be his Page"  And to me also Madam said I by giving me an Opportunity of seeing a Lady whose Beauty has in my Opinion no equal in the World"  Celia  smiling told me I had learned of my Master to flatter yet she did not seem displeased with my Discourse but protracted my Stay by asking me a great many Questions concerning  Felismena  to whom she had heard Don  Felix  had formerly paid his Addresses  I sighed and blushed when she mentioned my Name but my Emotion escaped her Observation and having satisfied her Curiosity about  Felismena  whose Beauty Wit and Love for Don  Felix  were the Subjects of her Interrogatories I entreated her to send some kind Message to my Master"  Tell him said she that I have read his Letter and am willing to believe the Truth of his Professions but  Valerius  added she in a lower Voice this Favour your Master owes to you I perceive you love him and and to  oblige you I condescend to give him this Satisfaction"  She accompanied these Words with a Look so extreamly expressive that I had not the least Room to doubt the secret Purport of them I bowed respectfully and retired full of Surprize at this unexpected Incident yet not without a Hope it might produce something favourable to my Love  Don  Felix  finding the never received any Answer from  Celia  unless I was the Bearer of his Letter took Care always to assign me this Employment  Celia  by these Means seeing me every Day conceived a very violent Affection for me which however she only discovered by her Sighs and Looks but her Indifference towards Don  Felix  was far from producing the Effects I hoped and expected his Passion seemed to increase in Proportion as she neglected him and so great was his Despair that apprehending it might endanger his Life I whom it might well be imagined was the last Person in the World who would sollicit her Compassion for him I fair Nymphs threw myself at her Feet and with Tears besought her to have some Regard to the sad Condition to which her Rigour had reduced my Master  Celia  who had flattered herself with the Hopes of having made some Impression on my Heart imagined by my suppliant Posture and the first Words I uttered that I was going to plead for myself but no sooner did she hear the  Name of Don  Felix  than losing in an Instant all her former Complacency her Cheeks glowed with indignant Blushes her Eyes flashed a look of Rage and Disappointment and rising from her Chair with trembling Emotion 'Be gone ungrateful said she to me is it for thy Master then thou pleadest when thou hast long known my Soul was devoted to thee have I lived to be despised by such a one as thou art oh cursed Fortune oh more cursed Love but I will be revenged if not on thee I will on myself My Death shall free me at once from thy scorn and the Upbraidings of my own conscious Mind"  Saying this she flew into an adjoining Apartment making fast the Door after her which left me not the Possibility of pursuing her if I had had an Inclination to it  Grief and Amazement kept me for some Moments immoveable as a Statue at length I departed but my Thoughts were in such Confusion at the strange Accident which had happened that I came into the Presence of Don  Felix  without being prepared with any Answer from  Celia  His eager Interrogatories rousing me from the deep Reverie into which I was plunged I replied at Random that  Celia  was engaged with Company and that I could not procure an Opportunity of speaking to her  Don  Felix  sighing profoundly told me I must go then the next Day I did but oh  fair Nymphs of the chaste Goddess what was my Astonishment and Grief when I was informed by  Celia  's chief Attendant that she was dead having expired some Hours after I left her in a fainting Fit  Had my Soul been less susceptible of Tenderness and Gratitude than it was the Death of a Rival had not disturbed it so much but knowing myself to be the unhappy though innocent Cause of her Death I could not hear of it without feeling the deepest Affliction which the Apprehension of Don  Felix  's Sorrow increased to such a Degree that I was almost distracted  At my Return Home I found him lost in the wildest Agonies of Despair the News had already reached him none of his Servants durst approach him he even commanded me who was his Favourite out of his Presence Heaven knows with what Reluctance I obeyed From that fatal Day I saw him no more he departed without acquainting any of his Friends or Servants with the Place to which he designed to go  No Words can paint the Torments I endured at this new Misfortune deprived of his Presence for whom I only wished to live I loathed the Sight of Day I cursed my Fate my hapless Love and all Things but my  Felix  These Agonies were too violent to continue long Nature was too weak to support  them their Rage at Length subsided a calm of Grief ensued and Hope the false intoxicating Friend of Love represented it still possible for me to be happy if I could find my  Felix  Roused by this flattering Thought I resolved to seek him through the World and have already wasted two Years in my Pursuit of him  Chance brought me to these Plains where being struck with the peaceful Simplicity of a pastoral Life and absolutely despairing ever to see Don  Felix  more I threw off the Habit of a Man and in the Weeds of a Shepherdess wandered through these Woods still nourishing with Solitude and Tears the fatal Passion that consumes me  Heaven by affording me an Opportunity of delivering you fair Nymphs from the Danger with which you were threatened seems to be preparing a Reverse of Fate for me the first Ray of Joy that ever dawned upon my Soul since the Absence of my beloved Don  Felix  was occasioned by being made the Instrument of your Deliverance oh may it be a happy Omen of Fortune's future Favours let me hail it as the Beginning of that Happiness which the Sight of my Don  Felix  will raise me to"  The beautiful  Felismena  ended here and the fair Votaries of  Diana  confirmed her in that  agreeable Hope with Reasons founded on the true Delicacy and noble Perseverance of her Passion and all joining to intreat she would consent to reside with them in the Palace of the sage  Felicia  'till Fortune had made some Change in her Affairs she readily embraced their Offer and set out with them for the Temple of  Diana  The Reader by comparing the Incidents that compose the Fable of  The Two Gentlemen of Verona  with those in the foregoing Story will easily perceive that  Protheus  and  Julia  in the Play are the same with  Felix  and  Felismena  in the Novel  The Story indeed is highly romantic and improbable and  Shakespear  's Judgment in rejecting many of the Circumstances might be praised if those he has invented were not equally absurd 'tis generally allowed that the Plot Conduct Manners and Sentiments of this Play are extreamly deficient  The Court and Palace of the Duke of  Milan  to which first Sir  Valentine  and then Sir  Protheus  are sent to improve their Politeness in has less Dignity and Decorum in it than the House of a private Gentleman  Silvia  the Duke's Daughter notwithstanding we are told with wonderful Simplicity in different Passages of the Play that she is  a virtuous civil Gentlewoman  yet behaves with all the rustic Smartness and awkward Gaiety of a Village Coquet  She is introduced flirting from Room to Room followed by two of her Lovers and laughing equally at the Man she favours and him she rejects slyly inciting them to quarrel and when she has set them together by the Ears enjoys the Jest 'till the good Prince her Father comes in to part them  Sir  Valentine  's Courtship of this Princess it must be confessed is extreamly singular and the Appearance of his dirty Footman  Speed  in the  PresenceChamber  breaking Jests upon his Master and her Highness while they are discoursing has something in it very new and uncommon The following Scene will give the Reader a Specimen of Sir  Valentine  's Gallantry the Wit of his Servant and the princely Breeding of  Silvia  the Duke's Daughter  VALENTINE  Madam and Mistress a Thousand good Morrows  SPEED  Oh give ye good Ev'n here's a Million of Manners  SILVIA  Sir

ignorant to whom it goes  I writ at Random very doubtfully  SILVIA  Perchance you think too much of so much Pains  VALENTINE  No Madam so it steed you I will write  Please you command a Thousand Times

Love  Can feed on the Air I am one that am nourished  By my Victuals and would fain have Meat  Oh be not like your Mistress be moved be moved  Silvia  notwithstanding this seeming Indifference is so violently in Love with  Valentine  that being prevented in her Design of marrying him privately and in Consequence of her refusing to marry Sir  Thurio  a foolish Knight whom the Duke thinks a fit Match for the Princess his Daughter because he has a great deal of Money being confined in a high Tower resolves to forsake her Father's Court and follow the banished  Valentine  to  Mantua  The poor Princess being in such a perplexing Situation confined guarded and not suffered to have any Correspondence with any Person but her destined Husband  Thurio  and her Lover's false Friend  Protheus  one would imagine some great Degree of Invention must be exerted to contrive a probable Stratagem to release her  The Poet gets over this Difficulty with wonderful Ease  Silvia  is shewn talking from her Chamberwindow in the Tower in broad Day to Sir  Eglamour  her Confidant below settling with him whom she desires to accompany her the Method of her Escape which is to be effected by his meeting her with Horses at Friar  Patrick  's Cell whither she intends to go to Confession  To make all this probable 'tis necessary that the Spies and Guards set over this Princess must be all blind otherwise she and Sir  Eglamour  must unavoidably be seen by them Tis also necessary that they should be deaf or else they could not fail to hear the whole Contrivance for her Chamber we are informed is in a high Tower at a great Distance from the Ground which made it impassible for Sir  Eglamour  and her to settle their Schemes in Whispers and lastly 'tis absolutely necessary that this confined Princess should have the Liberty of rambling alone out of her Tower to Confession or she could not so confidently  make an Assignation with  Eglamour  at Friar  Patrick  's Cell nor so securely keep it  Nothing can be more inconsistent than the Character of  Valentine  nothing more improper than the Manners attributed to him as a Lover  Passionately enamoured as he is with  Silvia  he recommends a new Lover to her with the utmost Earnestness and will not be satisfied 'till she promises to entertain him  When he is banished to  Milan  and in the extreamest Despair for the Loss of his Mistress the Fear of Death prevails upon him to become the Head of a Gang of Banditti and having in this Situation fortunately rescued his beloved  Silvia  from the Violence of his treacherous Friend who was going to ravish her a few repentant Words uttered by that Friend makes him resolve to resign her to him notwithstanding the generous Proof she had given him of her Tenderness in running so many Hazards to be with him  PROTHEUS  Forgive me  Valentine  if hearty Sorrow  Be a sufficient Ransom for Offence  I tender't here I do as truly suffer  As e'er I did commit  VALENTINE  Then I am paid  And once again I do receive thee  Who by Repentance is not satisfied  Is nor of Heaven nor Earth for these are pleas'd  By Penitence the Eternal's Wrath's appeas'd  And that my Love may appear plain and free  All that was mine in  Silvia  I give thee  This Part of the Intrigue of the Play such as it is that relates to the Loves of  Silvia  and  Valentine  is probably the Poet's own Invention but the Adventure of  Julia  and  Protheus  are copied closely from the Pastoral Romance  The Poet drops the Story at the Flight of  Silvia  and adds all the remaining Circumstances  He also paints  Protheus  in much more disadvantageous Colours than he is represented in the Original there we find him indeed inconstant to his Mistress who loves him passionately and forsaking her for one that treats him with the utmost Disdain  But  Shakespear  shews him treacherous in the highest Degree to his Friend base and ungrateful to the Duke his Benefactor and guilty of intended Violence towards the Woman he professes to love yet wicked as he is he escapes not only without Punishment but is made as happy as the renewed Tenderness of his injured Friend and the inviolable Fidelity of his once loved  Julia  can make him  The Character of  Julia  is much nearer the Original than that of  Protheus  but in the Romance we find her when she is in the Quality of a Page to Don  Felix  exerting a very extraordinary kind of Generosity in solliciting her Rival's Favour for her Lover  Shakespear  very judiciously makes her act a quite contrary Part instead of endeavouring to move her Rival's Compassion for  Protheus  she tries to engage it for the unhappy Object of his former Affection representing her Love her Constancy her Grief at being abandoned in the most pathetic Terms and by artfully intermixing some Praises of her Beauty insinuates the little Reliance she ought to have upon the prostituted Vows of a Man so prone to change  The Behaviour of  Felismena  upon her Maid's offering her a Letter from Don  Felix  in the Romance is plainly the Foundation of the following Scene in the Play and though the Dialogue is not copied yet the ridiculous Prudery of the Mistress and the artful Management of the Maid have so near a Resemblance that it cannot be doubted  Shakespear  had it in his Eye  SCENE JULIA's  Chamber  Enter  JULIA  and  LUCETTA  JULIA  But say  Lucetta  now we are alone  Woud'st thou then counsel me to fall in Love  LUCETTA  Ay Madam so you stumble not unheedfully  JULIA  Of all the fair Resort of Gentlemen  That ev'ry Day with parl encounter me  In thy Opinion which is the worthiest Love  LUCETTA  Please you repeat their Names I'll shew my Mind  According to my shallow simple Skill  JULIA  What think'st thou of the fair Sir  Eglamour  LUCETTA  As of a Knight well spoken neat and fine  But were I you he never should be mine  JULIA  What think'st thou of the rich  Mercutio  LUCETTA  Well of his wealth but of himself so so  JULIA  What think'st thou of the gentle  Protheus  LUCETTA  Lord Lord to see what Folly reigns in us  JULIA  How now what means this Passion at his Name  LUCETTA  Pardon dear Madam 'tis a passing Shame  That I unworthy Body as I am  Should censure thus one lovely Gentleman  JULIA  Why not on  Protheus  as of all the rest  LUCETTA  Then thus of many good I think him best  JULIA  Your Reason  LUCETTA  I have no other but a Woman's Reason  I think him so because I think him so  JULIA  And would'st thou have me cast my Love on him  LUCETTA  Ay if you thought your Love not cast away  JULIA  Why he of all the rest hath never mov'd me  LUCETTA  Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye  JULIA  His little speaking shews his Love but small  LUCETTA  The Fire that's closest kept burns most of all  JULIA  They do not love that do not shew their Love  LUCETTA  Oh they love least that let Men know their Love  JULIA  I would I knew his Mind  LUCETTA  Peruse this Paper Madam  JULIA  To  Julia  say from whom  LUCETTA  That the Contents will shew  JULIA  Say say who gave it thee  LUCETTA  Sir  Valentine  's Page and sent I think from  Protheus  He would have given it you but I being in the Way  Did in your Name receive it pardon the Fault I pray  JULIA  Now by my Modesty a goodly Broker  Dare you presume to harbour wanton Lines  To whisper and conspire against my Youth  Now trust me 'tis an Office of great Worth  And you an Officer fit for the Place  There take the Paper see it be return'd  Or else return no more into my Sight  LUCETTA  To plead for Love deserves more Fee than Hate  JUILA  Will ye be gone  LUCETTA  Thus you may ruminate  Exit  JULIA  And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the Letter  It were a Shame to call her back again  And pray her to a Fault for which I chid her  What Fool is she that knows I am a Maid  And would not force the Letter to my View  Since Maids in Modesty say No to that  Which they would have the Proff'rer construe Ay  Fie fie how wayward is this foolish Love  That like a testy Babe will scratch the Nurse  And presently all humbled kiss the Rod  How churlishly I chid  Lucetta  hence  When willingly I would have had her here  How angerly I taught my Brow to frown  When inward Joy enforc'd my Heart to smile  My Penance is to call  Lucetta  back  And ask Remission for my Folly past  What ho  Lucetta  Reenter  LUCETTA  LUCETTA  What would your Ladyship  JULIA  Is't near Dinnertime  LUCETTA  I would it were  That you might kill your Stomach on your Meat  And not upon your Maid  JULIA  What is't that you  Took up so gingerly  LUCETTA  Nothing  JULIA  Why didst thou stoop then  LUCETTA  To take a Paper up that I let fall  JULIA  And is that Paper nothing  LUCETTA  Nothing concerning me  JULIA  Then let it lye for those that it concerns  LUCETTA  Madam it will not lye where it concerns  Unless it have a false Interpreter  JULIA  Some Love of yours hath writ to you in Rhime  LUCETTA  That I might sing it Madam to a Tune  Give me a Note your Ladyship can set  JULIA  As little by such Lays as may be possible  Best sing it to the Tune of  Light o' Love  LUCETTA  It is too heavy for so light a Tune  JULIA  Heavy belike it hath some burthen then  LUCETTA  Ay and melodious were it would you sing it  JULIA  And why not you  LUCETTA  I cannot reach so high  JULIA  Let's see your Song  How now Minion  LUCETTA  Keep Tune there still so you will sing it out  And yet methinks I do not like this Tune  JULIA  You do not  LUCETTA  No Madam 'tis too sharp  JULIA  You Minion are too saucy  LUCETTA  Nay now you are too flat  And mar the Concord with too harsh a Discant▪  There wanteth but a Mean to fill your Song  JULIA  The Mean is drown'd with your unruly Bass  LUCETTA  Indeed I bid the Bass for  Protheus  JULIA  This Babble shall not henceforth trouble me  Here is a Coil with Protestation  tears it  Go get you gone and let the Papers lye  You would be fingering them to anger me  LUCETTA  She makes it strange but she would be best pleas'd  To be so anger'd with another Letter  Exit  JULIA  Nay would I were so anger'd with the same  Oh hateful Hands to tear such loving Words  Injurious Wasps to feed on such sweet Honey  And kill the Bees that yield it with your Stings  I'll kiss each several Paper for Amends  Look here is writ kind  Julia  unkind  Julia  As in Revenge of thy Ingratitude  I throw thy Name against the bruising Stones  Trampling contemptuously on thy Disdain  Look here is writ Lovewounded  Protheus  Poor wounded Name i  my Bosom as a Bed  Shall lodge thee 'till thy Wound be throughly heal'd  And thus I search it with a sav'ring Kiss  But twice or thrice was  Protheus  written down  Be calm good Wind blow not a Word away  'Till I have found each Letter in the Letter  Except mine own Name That some Whirlwind bear  Unto a ragged fearful hanging Rock  And throw it thence into the raging Sea  So here in one Line is his Name twice writ  Poor forlorn  Protheus  passionate  Protheus  To the sweet  Julia  that I'll tear away  And yet I will not sith so prettily  He couples it to his complaining Names  Thus will I fold them one upon another  Now kiss embrace contend do what you will  Enter  LUCETTA  LUCETTA  Madam Dinner is ready and your Father stays  JULIA  Well let us go  LUCETTA  What shall these Papers lye like Telltales here  JULIA  If thou respect them best to take them up  LUCETTA  Nay I was taken up for laying them down  Yet here they shall not lye for catching Cold  JULIA  I see you have a Month's Mind to them  LUCETTA  Ay Madam you may say what Sights you see  I see Things too although your judge I wink  JULIA  Come come will't please you go  Exeunt  This Play every where abounds with the most ridiculous Absurdities in the Plot and Conduct of the Incidents as well as with the greatest Improprieties in the Manners and Sentiments of the Persons  The Princess because it is necessary she should meet with her Lover in the Wood without having the Power of making herself invisible gets away from her Guards and out of her high Tower and gallops like an Amazon attended only by one Squire to  Mantua  'Tis no Wonder therefore that in such an Equipage and engaged in such a romantic Design she should fall into the Hands of the  Banditti nor that she should meet with her Lover amongst them since the Poet had prepared us for this wonderful Incident by a preceding one full as astonishing in making the noble Youth the Captain of this Band of Villains  It seeming necessary also to the Poet's Design that the Duke of  Milan  should fall into the same Danger we find the good old Prince upon the News of his Daughter's Flight instead of dispatching several Parties of his Guards different Ways to overtake and bring her back mounting his Horse himself and with no other Attendants than  Protheus  who is a Stranger in his Dominions and  Thurio  the foolish Knight he designed for his Soninlaw ridingaway in Search of her  'Tis easy to see that by this Management he must fall into the Hands of the Banditti and accordingly there we meet with him next The Duke's bestowing his Daughter upon  Valentine  whom he finds at the Head of this desperate Gang of Ruffians after refusing her to him when he lived in his Court with an unblemished Reputation is indeed a little incomprehensible as is also  Valentine  's Willingness to resign his beloved Mistress to his false Friend who had offered Violence to her Chastity and  Silvia's  giving her Hand to him after so striking a Proof of his Indifference and Ingratitude  I cannot omit taking Notice of one Blunder among many others I shall pass over  Valentine    after having just before declared that it is with Difficulty he restrains the Villains who had chosen him for their Chief from the most brutal Outrages recommends them to the Duke's Favour with these Words  These banish'd Men that I have kept withal  Are Men endow'd with worthy Qualities  Forgive them what they have committed here  And let them be recalled from their Exile  They are reform'd civil full of Good  And fit for great Employment worthy Lord  Their Reformation must be very sudden indeed for 'tis not more than three Minutes since he had complained of their Villainy and he could have no Opportunity of knowing this Change in their Manners for from that Time 'till the End of the Play he has no farther Communication with them  Yet it is not enough to make him sollicit their Pardon but he must also recommend them to great Employments and the poor easy Duke gives him an absolute Power of providing for them as he pleases  The Wit in this Play consists in Puns Quibbles Antitheses's and playing upon Words and the Humour is all divided between  Launce  and his Dog The last of these Personages is indeed a Mute which those who contend for the Learning of  Shakespear  may say he introduced in Imitation of the Ancients as he gives Rise like those in the  ancient Comedy to several Incidents in the Play I shall transcribe a Scene between  Protheus  and  Speed  and a Speech of  Launcet  to his Dog which may serve as a Specimen of the Wit and Humour of the Comedy  SPEED  Sir  Protheus  save you save you my Master  PROTHEUS  But now he parted hence t'embark for Milan  SPEED  Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already  And I have play'd the Sheep in losing him  PROTHEUS  Indeed a Sheep doth very often stray  An if the Shepherd be awhile away  SPEED  You conclude that my Master is a Shepherd then and I a Sheep  PROTHEUS  I do  SPEED  Why then my Horns are his Horns whether I wake or sleep  PROTHEUS  A silly Answer and fitting well a Sheep  SPEED  This proves me still a Sheep  PROTHEUS  True and thy Master a Shepherd  SPEED  Nay that I can deny by a Circumstance  PROTHEUS  It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another  SPEED  The Shepherd seeks the Sheep and not the Sheep the Shepherd but I seek my Master and my Master seeks not me therefore I am no Sheep  PROTHEUS  The Sheep for Fodder follows the Shepherd the Shepherd for the Food follows not the Sheep thou for Wages followest thy Master thy Master for Wages follows not thee therefore thou art a Sheep  SPEED  Such another Proof will make me cry Baâ  PROTHEUS  But dost thou hear gavest thou my Letter to  Julia  SPEED  Aye Sir I a lost Mutton gave your Letter to her a lac'd Mutton and she a lac'd  Mutton gave me a lost Mutton nothing for my Labour  PROTHEUS  Here's too small a Pasture for such Store of Muttons  SPEED  If the Ground be overcharg'd you were best stick her  PROTHEUS  Nay in that you are astray 'twere best pound you  SPEED  Nay Sir less than a Pound shall serve me for carrying your Letter  PROTHEUS  You mistake I mean the Pound a Penfold  SPEED  From a Pound to a Pin fold it over and over it is threefold too little for carrying a Letter to your Lover  PROTHEUS  But what said she Did she nod  Speed  nods  SPEED  I  PROTHEUS  Nod I Why that's Noddy  SPEED  You mistook Sir I said She did nod  And you ask me if she did nod and I said I  PROTHEUS  And that set together is Noddy  SPEED  Now you have taken the Pains to set it together take it for your Pains  PROTHEUS  No no you shall have it for bearing the Letter  SPEED  Well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you  PROTHEUS  Why Sir how do you bear with me  SPEED  Marry Sir the Letter very orderly  Having nothing but the Word Noddy for my Pains  PROTHEUS  Beshrew me but you have a quick Wit  SPEED  And yet it cannot overtake your slow Purse  PROTHEUS  Come come open the Matter in brief What said she  SPEED  Open your Purse that the Money and the Matter may be both at once delivered  PROTHEUS  Well Sir here is for your Pains What said she  SPEED  Truly Sir I think you'll hardly win her  PROTHEUS  Why Could'st thou perceive so much from her  SPEED  Sir I cou'd perceive nothing at all from her  No not so much as a Ducat for delivering your Letter  And being so hard to me that brought your Mind  I fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling her Mind  PROTHEUS  What said she nothing  SPEED  No not so much astake this for your Pains  To testify your Bounty I thank you you have tester'd me  In requital whereof henceforth carry your Letter yourself  And Sir I'll commend you to my Master  Enter  LAUNCE  with his Dog  When a Man's Servant shall play the Cur with him look you it goes hard One that I brought up of a Puppy one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind Brothers and Sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say precisely Thus would I teach a Dog I went to deliver him as a Present to Mrs  Sylvia  from my Master and I came no sooner into the DiningChamber but he steps me to her Trencher and steals her Capon's Leg Oh 'tis a foul Thing when a Cur cannot keep himself in all Companies I would have as one would say one that takes upon him to be a Dog indeed to be as it were a Dog at all things If I had no more Wit than he to take a Fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged for it sure as I live he had suffered for't You shall judge He thrust me himself into the Company of three or four Gentlemenlike Dogs under the Duke's Table He had not been there bless the Mark Out with the Dog says one What Cur is that says another Whip him out says a third Hang him up says the Duke I having been acquainted with the Smell before knew it was  Crab  and goes me to the Fellow that whips the Dog Friend quoth I you mean to whip  the Dog Ay marry I do quoth he You do him the more Wrong quoth I 'twas I did the Thing you wot of He makes no more ado but whips me out of the Chamber How many Masters would do this for their Servants Nay I'll be sworn I have sat in the Stocks for Puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the Pillory for Geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffer'd for it Thou think'st not of this now Nay I remember the Trick you served me when I took my Leave of Madam  Silvia  did I not bid thee mark me and do as I do c c  The Story of  Troilus  and  Cressida  From CHAUCER  _THE Story of the  Trojan  War is well known the Princes of  Greece  united in Arms for the Recovery of  Helen  and to revenge her Rape had besieged  Troy  almost ten Years with various Success when  Calcas  one of the principal Lords of  Troy  went over to their Party  To this Nobleman who was very well skilled in Divine Mysteries  Apollo  revealed the certain Destruction of  Troy  and to prevent his being a Partaker in the foredoom'd Desolation of his Country he stole privately out of the City and fled to the  Grecian  Camp making Use of his Skill in foreseeing Things to come to recommend him to the  Greeks  who finding great Advantage from this his Science held him in high Esteem  The News of  Calcas  's Flight being spread through the City the People enraged at his Treachery were for sacrificing all the Relations and Friends he had left behind him to their Revenge  Cressida  his only Daughter a young Lady of exquisite Beauty being wholly ignorant of her Father's Flight was more than any other astonished at the News Distracted with Shame for the Baseness and Treachery of her Father and wild with her Fears of the Insults of the enraged Populace she cast herself at the Feet of  Hector  in a mourning Habit and with Tears protesting her own Innocence implored his Protection  The generous Heart of  Hector  was greatly moved with the Distress of the kneeling Beauty He raised her up and assured her her Father's Treason should reflect no Dishonour upon her that she should enjoy his Estates and if she pleased live happy in  Troy  under his Protection  Cressida  thanked him with a graceful Humility and returning to her House began from thenceforward to live with the greatest Privacy and Retirement so nicely conscious she was of her Father's Disgrace and so delicately attentive to her own unhappy Situation that the People charmed with her Conduct no longer remembered the Treason of her Father to her Disadvantage  It was the Custom in  Troy  to celebrate the Feast of  Pallas  in the Month of  April  the King's Sons with the Matrons and Maids of Quality and the Knights of  Troy  assisted at this Solemnity  The charming  Cressida  though dressed in a Widow's Habit appeared with a thousand Advantages among the Rest Her Beauty like a bright Star breaking through the Veil of an envious Cloud dazzled the whole Assembly unmoved with the murmured Praises she heard around her and desirous of escaping Notice she stood with humble Modesty near the Door bending her lovely Eyes on the Ground while the Blushes which sometimes crimsoned over her fair Face and the sweet Pensiveness of her Attitude shewed her Thoughts were more employed on her Father's Unhappiness than the Admiration her Form excited  Troilus  whose Eyes were ever wandering in search of fair Objects though fixed on no particular one was among the last who took Notice of the beauteous  Cressida  This young Prince gay handsome and a Warrior had never felt the soft Inquietudes of Love he despised the Power of the winged Deity and triumphing in his own Indifference laughed at the Torments of others roving as was his Custom through the Temple with some of his young Knights and beholding with wandering Glances the Ladies as they stood often slily leering on his Companions to observe if any of them breathed a Sigh or darted a desiring Look at one of them The God of Love offended with his continual Mockeries bent his Bow that Moment in a Rage and sent one of his keenest Arrows to  his Heart the lovely pensive  Cressida  was the Object that fixed his Attention  Oh Heavens cried he to himself while his Eyes feasted on the ravishing Beauties of her Face Where hast thou been hid thus long thou that art so lovely fair Where has such matchless Beauty been concealed that my delighted Eyes were never blessed with it before While he was thus contemplating her with Emotions he had 'till then been a Stranger to  Cressida  raising her Head turned her bright Eyes by Chance on  Troilus  and with that Look compleated the Conquest of his Heart He sighed as with an ardent Gaze he met the languishing yet too powerful Glance of the afflicted Beauty and she hastily averting her Face again he sighed and conscious of his former Injuries to Love turned to his Companions to see if any of them observed his new Disorder leaving the Temple at length he went Home to his own Palace  Solitude now was all he sought and dismissing his Companions on Pretence of private Business he retired to his Chamber to indulge his new Meditations there making a Mirror of his Mind he contemplated the Image of the beauteous  Cressida  his raptured Fancy dwelt upon the inchanting Look she gave him and every recollected Charm added Strength to the fatal Passion that consumed him  Love giving new Ardour to the bright Flames of Glory he rushed with more than  mortal Courage to the Field yet was it not his Hatred to the  Greeks  nor his Desire of preserving the Town which poured the Thunder of his resistless Arm upon the Foe Renown he fought but fought it only to make him more worthy of the lovely  Cressida  True Love is ever accompanied with Diffidence and Fear  Troilus  though a Prince young lovely and the Object of general Esteem yet pined in seeret without daring to reveal his Passion to her who inspired it  Despair took Possession of his Soul at the same Moment that he became a Slave to Love he passed whole Nights in S  ghs Tears and Complaints his Cheeks had no longer the Freshness of Youth his Eyes lost their sparkling Lustre Melancholy was painted in his Mien and Dejection sat on every Feature  Pandarus  the Uncle of  Cressida  and the intimate Friend of  Troilus  having for some time observed and wondered at this strange Alteration resolved to make him if possible disclose the Cause For this Purpose he went early one Morning to his Palace and entering his Apartment without giving any previous Notice found the unhappy Youth seated on his Bed his Arms folded passionately on his Breast his Head reclined and all the Marks of the most profound Sorrow strongly impressed on his Countenance  Pandarus  lost in Astonishment and Grief stood some Moments at a Distance contemplating  him without being perceived by the lovesick Prince whose Thoughts were so intensely fixed on the Idea of the lovely  Cressida  that he had no Eyes or Ears for external Objects O ye Gods exclaimed  Pandarus  at last what can this mean is it the  Greeks  my Prince that have reduced you to this Condition O Shame to Manhood shall those Enemies of our Country boast of having overthrown one of its strongest Pillars Or has some enthusiastic Fit of Devotion siezed thy Mind and given thee up to more than Woman's Softness Art thou mourning for some imaginary Crime and trying to appease the offended Deities with Tears  The artful  Pandarus  spoke in this Manner not because he doubted the Courage of  Troilus  of which he had given a Thousand glorious Proofs but that by this Reproach he might awake him from that Lethargy of Woe in which he saw him sunk and rouse him to a more noble Passion  The Prince slowly raising his Head and beholding his Friend with Eyes that betrayed no other Emotion than Grief Ah said he with a Voice almost smothered with Sighs what ill Chance brought thee hither to behold my lost Condition Leave me I conjure thee by the Gods stay not to see me die for well I know my Death will give thee Pain and yet alas such is my extream Affliction that Death is all the Relief I can expect but yet pursued he after a little Pause and raising his  Voice while a faint Blush dispelled for a Moment the languid Paleness of his Cheek Think not my  Pandarus  that it is Dread of the  Greeks  which has brought thy Friend thus low ah 'tis a Power stronger far than theirs not the united Force of their whole Army could sink thy  Troilus  thus My Soul my Soul's subdued and that's beyond their Reach Oh my  Pandarus  enquire no more I cannot dare not will not tell thee more leave me again I bid thee leave me it is not fit the Cause of my Despair should be revealed no let it rest in everlasting Silence and perish with myself  Alas said  Pandarus  excessively moved what is this Affliction that is to be concealed from me Oh Prince if ever there was Love and Truth betwixt us do not I beseech thee do not commit so great a Cruelty as to hide your Sorrows from me if I cannot give you Comfort I will partake your Pain I have a Friend's Right in your Distress deprive me not of it lest I suspect your Truth or imagine you doubt mine  Ah said  Troilus  sighing you have conquered my  Pandarus  to you and you only will I discover my Weakness Love to whose Power I have been so long a Rebel hath shot his fiercest Fires into my Heart I burn I rage with ardent Passion I languish with Desire and oh Despair consumes me What have I then to do but die since Death alone can free me from my Torments  Ah Prince said  Pandarus  it was unkindly done to conceal so long your Passion from your Friend My Advice my Assistance might perhaps 'ere this have made you happy Alas interrupted  Troilus  thou who hast been so unsuccessful in Love with what Confidence can'st thou undertake to make me happy  I have been unfortunate 'tis true replied  Pandarus  but those Misfortunes have taught me that Experience which you want hence am I qualified to give you Counsel that may prevent your falling into the Evils I have suffered Oft have I seen a blind Man walk securely where one who was blest with perfect Sight has stumbled Well does the Proverb say  A Fool full often may a wise Man guide  A Whetstone is not indeed an Instrument to carve with but it sharpens those that do If then you think I have committed Errors let my Folly be your School and learn therein to avoid what I have been undone by Everything my dear Prince is best explained by its contrary The Palate that never tasted Bitterness has not so quick a Relish for Sweets The Heart that never languished with Distress is blunted to the gentle Thrils of Pleasure With White be Black compared with Honour Shame each by its different Qualities shews the other  The Prince appeared wholly insensible to this Discourse not once lifting up his Eyes or giving the smallest Indication that he heard it  Pandarus  whose Resentment was awakened by this Neglect began to shake him by the Arm as if he supposed him in a Lethargy Rouse rouse yourself for shame he cried from this Stupidity nor listen like the dronish Beast of Burden to what I say who when a Harp is playing hears the Sound but knows not that 'tis Music  Troilus  at this Reproach raising his Head with a deep Sigh and fixing a languishing Look upon his FriendPeace Peace cried he I am not deaf I have heard all thy Discourse but in the Name of the immortal Gods what are thy Proverbs to me how will they help me Leave me O leave me to bewail my Fate Thou can'st not cure me Friend I wish not to be cured leave me and let me die  Why this is Madness Prince said  Pandarus  hastilyBut one Word more tell me the Name of this powerful Beauty that has charmed you I'll hasten to her I'll plead your Cause I'll force her to have Compassion on you  Oh no interrupted  Troilus  vehemently that must not be Wilt thou then die for a Woman resumed  Pandarus  sigh out thy Soul inglorious here at home and press a lovesick  Couch with thy languid Limbs Ah rather case them in Armour as thou wast wont rush on the insulting Foe and turn your Grief to Fury and Revenge so shall your Fall be useful to your Country But if you sink thus poorly under your Passion and rather than reveal it die your Name will be consigned to Infamy for ever your Death will be imputed to your Fear of the  Greeks  and her you love in common with the rest of the World will scorn and hate your Memory  Troilus  touched to his inmost Soul with this predicted Shame started wildly from his Seat and traversing the Room with great Emotion stopt suddenly and looking fixedly on his Friend Oh said he with a Sigh what must I do  Tell me the Name of her you love said  Pandarus  say do I know her If so I shall succeed the better in my Applications  This Question threw the lovesick Prince into such Confusion that not being able to stand again he sunk upon his Bed his Face glowed with Blushes his conscious Eyes bent their Looks upon the Ground he sigh'd he trembled but continued silent  Pandarus  heedfully observing his Emotion exclaimed in a transported Tone Ah Prince I see I am interested in this Fair One by  Venus  and her sportful Son you shall conceal her Name no longer  And will you know her Name said  Troilus  trembling Oh my  Pandarus  the Name of my sweet Enemy is  Cressida  thy Niece my Friend  Here his Voice falter'd he stop'd he sigh'd while Fear Hope and anxious Expectation at once assailed his Heart with all their Force and gave such Meaning to his wishing Eyes that  Pandarus  eager to relieve his Inquietude strained him to his Breast with an affectionate Embrace Be comforted my Prince cried he in a Tone that expressed the highest Degree of Satisfaction  Cressida  shall be yours if I have any Power over her you are worthy of her and she of you not  Hellen  herself can boast a brighter Form than  Cressida  add to that her blooming Youth her amiable Modesty the mingled Sweetness and Dignity of her Manners Oh Prince she shall be yours I swear by Heaven she shall no more complaining then banish your Fears and rely upon my Will and Power to make you happy  Troilus  almost out of himself with Joy at this unexpected good Fortune hung upon his Neck awhile in speechless Transports then suddenly exclaiming Come now ye  Greeks  cried he oppose your whole united Force against this Breast  Troilus  shall stand it all his Love shall give him double Vigour and ye shall feel it to your Cost Oh  Pandarus  my Life and Death are in thy Hand thou hast  restored me to myself continue still thy friendly Offices and be the Guardian God of  Troilus  Farewell my Friend said  Pandarus  getting loose from his Embraces I will deserve your Thanks assure yourself I will In the mean time strengthen your Heart with Hope I go to seek your Happiness  With these Words he retired and  Troilus  now animated with double Fires called eagerly for his Armour and mounting his Horse rushed terrible to the Field Happy was the  Greek  that fled the Thunder of his Arm that Day inspired with more than mortal Courage like a vast Torrent he poured resistless on the Foe and bore down all before him  In the mean time  Pandarus  anxiously sollicitous to perform the Promises he had made to  Troilus  went to his Niece's House he found her alone in her Apartment reading and placing himself near her after some general Discourse he objected to her mourning Habit and solitary Way of Life which on Account of her Father's disgraceful Flight to the Enemies of his Country she still continued to observe  Why my charming Niece said he pursuing his Discourse why do you waste your Days in Loneliness and Woe Your Beauty was not given you to be wrapt in Shades nor must your Bloom of Youth be lost in Sol  tude Love courts you now with all his Train of Pleasures admit the  smiling God into your Bosom and bless some worthy Lover with your Charms  Ah Uncle interrupted  Cressida  her Face glowing with Blushes from you I little expected to hear such Discourse you who ought rather to defend my Heart against the dangerous Power of Love will you assist the sly Invader and betray your  Cressida  to Bondage Alas it is not for me to mix among the happy Youth of Troy pressed down as I am by my Father's Disgrace and my too conscious feeling of it No let me in Retirement conceal the Part I take in his Shame Retirement which from being necessary is become my Choice Love will not seek me here he flies the Miserable and only dwells with Chearfulness and Peace  No more of these melancholy Reflexions said  Pandarus  kissing away the Tears that fell from her charming Eyes you know not how bountiful the Gods have been to you Oh Niece they have bestowed a Blessing on you greater than your most sanguine Wishes durst aspire at  He stopp'd abruptly here and thinking he had said enough to awaken the Woman's Curiosity in her affected to talk of other Things and shortly after rose up to be gone  Cressida  who had been pleasingly alarmed by what her Uncle had said and was greatly disappointed at his discontinuing the Discourse  saw him about to depart with Uneasiness she wished to be delivered from the Perplexity his Hints had thrown her into but Shame prevented her from asking an Explanation of them  Pandarus  observed her Confusion with Pleasure he moved on towards the Door she followed him with downcast Eyes he turned to bid her farewel adieu answered she with Hesitation then seeming to recollect at that Instant what had past But will you go said she blushing and half averting her fair Face without telling me what good Fortune it is for which I ought this Day to thank the Gods  Panadarus  having brought her to the Point he desired took her Hand with a Smile and leading her to a Chair seated himself close by her It would be cruel my dearest Niece said he to keep you longer in Suspence know then you are beloved by one of the Sons of your King the young the brave the lovely  Troilus  never did any Heart glow with more ardent Fires than his he languishes he dies for you my  Cressida  compassionate his Pains reward him with your Heart and taste the Sweets of mutual Love  Ah me interrupted  Cressida  and is it for a Lover then that I must thank the Gods Is this the glorious Fortune they have destined for me and can you Oh my Uncle can you resolve to lead me through the dangerous Paths of Pleasure You who ought rather to watch over my unguarded Steps and save me from the treacherous Baits of Love Oh  Pallas  Guardian  Goddess of my Youth assist me now direct me in this doubtful Maze of Fate and save thy wretched Votary  Pandarus  beholding her in this Emotion rose from his Chair I see fair Niece said he you are not disposed to listen to the Passion my Friend has for you your Disdain will kill him I know it will his Life depends upon your Smiles and since my Interest with you is so small I'll share his Fate I cannot bear the Reproaches he will with Justice load me when he finds how ineffectual my Sollicitations have been Do you sigh cruel Maid said he for almost unknown to herself she breathed a deepdrawn Sigh Ah may it please the Gods to make you suffer in your Turn As for me since you suspect I would betray your Virtue you shall not see me soon again happy if by sacrificing my own Life I could save that of the noble  Troilus  but it will not be he loves too ardently to bear your Scorn without Desperation but I will share his Fate whatever it be and since I cannot save him I'll die with him  Cressida  alarmed at this Menace of her Uncle's and at his rising to leave her hastily seized his Arm Stay Oh stay she cried all that is consistent with my Honour I'll do to save you both I'll see the Prince I'll treat him mildly I'll not forbid him to hopebut ask no more my Honour's dearer to me than Life swear your Designs extend no farther than what I have promised and I am satisfied  Pandarus  assuring her with the most solemn Oaths that he would not press her to any greater Compliances perceiving her Fears were quieted began to talk of indifferent Matters which  Cressida  whose Soul was all in Tumult listened to with great Impatience interrupting him at length I would fain know said she with a conscious Blush in what Manner you first became acquainted with Prince  Troilu  's Passion for me Did he declare it to you himself Does he know how to gild a Lovesick Tale with soft prevailing Eloquence  Pandarus  with a Smile of Pleasure at this Demand related to her succinctly all that had passed between him and  Troilus  and painted his Love and his Despair in Colours so lively that the halfvanquished  Cressida  unwilling her Uncle should see her Emotions rose up and begging his Excuse retired to her Closet to contemplate at leisure on what had befallen her There first the Idea of  Troilus  young brave and lovely as she had seen him tender passionate and languishing as her Uncle represented him rose to her Imagination Softened and prepared by her artful Uncle to receive the dangerous Impression her Fancy dwelt with a Pleasure till then unknown upon the Graces of his Form his royal Birth his exalted Courage in a Youth so blooming her Vanity was flattered by the Preference he gave her to all the  Trojan  Beauties of the Court and her Compassion insensibly engaged by the Pains he suffer'd for her Sake Love first entering her Soul  in the Disguise of Gratitude waked there a lambent Flame whose pleasing Warmth play'd gently round her Heart and filled it with a new and sweet Sensation  While she sat thus wholly lost in pleasing Reflexions she heard a loud Shouting in the Street that roused her from her Reverie and made her hastily run to her Window to see the Occasion of it but what was her mingled Surprise and Confusion when she beheld Prince  Troilus  the Object of her Contemplation  The young Hero having that Day performed the most amazing Acts of Valour and driven the  Greeks  quite back to their Ships was returning home amidst the Acclamations of a numerous Croud who made the Skies resound with their loud Praises He was seated on a bay Steed who by reason of the Wounds he had received in the Fight carried him along with a slow Pace all richly armed he was except his Head so that his lovely Face being exposed to View and made more lovely by the decent Shame which glowed in bright Vermilion on his Cheek he charmed the eager Gazers into a Rapture of Delight His Helmet which hung carelessly by a String behind was hewn in twenty Places his Shield was pierced with Spears and many Arrows were to be seen still sticking in different Parts of it his Horse was marked with Blood that streamed from several Parts of his Body  In this fierce Equipage he would have look'd like the great God of War himself had not his charming Face expressed a softer and more amiable Divinity  Cressida  drew back her Head the Moment she beheld him conscious of what passed in her Heart a crimson Blush glowed in each lovely Cheek but though she had determined in her Mind not to look on him again her Eyes involuntary sought him out again she blushed alarm'd at her own Weakness again with an averted Look she tried to conceal the newborn sweet Anxiety from herself but it was in vain she could not resist the powerful Impulse that drew her Eyes towards him and kept them fixed upon him till he was out of Sight  This unexpected View of the young Hero in all the Pomp and Pageantry of War bearing away the chiefest Honours of the Field and crowned with the grateful Praises of his delivered Country compleated what her Uncle's Artifices had begun and made an entire Conquest of her Heart Love with all its Train of gentle Wishes Hopes Fears and soft Inquietudes took Possession of her Breast Awhile she resisted the sweet Invader and opposed her Reason to the subtle Flame but so unequal was the Contest so weak her Defence so powerful the Assault that neither hoping nor perhaps desiring to be free she gave herself up a willing Slave to the soft Chains of Love  In the mean time  Troilus  full of eager Anxiety to know his Fate no sooner arrived at his own Palace than he dispatched some of his Attendants to different Places to find out  Pandarus  and to bring him thither  Pandarus  immediately obeyed the Summons and related to his impatient Friend all the Conversation that had passed between him and his Niece He described her Looks her Sighs her Blushes her sweet Irresolution and thence derived sufficient Encouragement for the trembling Lover to write and in his own pathetic language sollicit her future Favour  Love having dictated to the ready Pen of  Troilus  the softest and most persuasive Eloquence that ever won a female Heart  Pandarus  undertook to deliver the Letter and accordingly carried it that Instant to  Cressida  The mounting Blood flush'd in her charming Face as soon as he offered the Billet to her Perusal then ran again in Tides tumultuous to her Heart and left her pale trembling and ready to sink before him he took her Hand he pressed it tenderly in his he swore by all the celestial Deities no Harm was meant to her Honour and conjured her if she had not resolved the Destruction of the noble  Troilus  to read and answer his Letter  Cressida  reassured by her Uncle's Protestations took the Letter from him and retired to her Chamber to read it The moving language  it contained had so sudden and so powerful an Effect on her soft Heart that she was easily prevailed upon by her Uncle to write a favourable Answer  The Correspondence thus happily begun the officious  Pandarus  never failed every Day to carry Letters Messages and Presents between the Lovers nor ceased his Solicitations in favour of  Troilus  to his Niece till he had won her to yield to his Desires  Troilus  at once the happy Favourite of  Cupid  and of  Mars  was as glorious in the Field as successful in his Love the  Greeks  trembled at his Name and the  Trojans  in him revered a second  Hector  Cressida  still continuing her solitary way of Life silently enjoyed the Praises of her beloved Hero at her Feet the passionate Warrior offered all his laurels for her he fought and conquered and sought his Recompence only in her Smiles But Fortune weary of showering Favours on these happy Lovers prepared a sad Reverse of Fate for them and when they least expected it stunned them with the Blow  The  Trojans  in a general Battle with the  Greeks  notwithstanding the godlike Valour of their Chiefs received a dreadful Defeat the Loss was so great on their Side that the venerable  Priam  found himself reduced to the  Necessity of desiring a Truce and an Exchange of Prisoners  When  Chalcas  the Father of  Cressida  heard of this Proposition he presented himself before the Council of War and earnestly intreated the Princes that they would suffer  Anterior  then a Prisoner in their Camp to be exchanged for  Cressida  his Daughter whom he had left in  Troy  at his Departure The  Greek  Princes consented to his Request and those that were named Commissioners for the  Greeks  with the  Trojans  were ordered to demand  Cressida  in exchange for  Antenor  At the Arrival of the  Grecian  Envoys in  Troy  King  Priam  summoned a Council to meet before which they appeared and gave an Account of their Commission  As soon as  Cressida  was named the great Heart of  Troilus  sunk within him an ashy Paleness overspread his Face convulsive shiverings seized every Limb and Grief and Rage were painted in his Eyes With trembling Impatience he waited to hear the Opinion of the Council revolving in his distracted Soul what he should do in case they gave up  Cressida  Love suggested to him that he ought rather to die than suffer  Cressida  to be ravished from his Arms but Reason represented that it was fit the Charmer of his Soul should be consulted as to her Intentions ere he proceeded to Extremities and then if she approved his firm Design to keep her he would defend her  against the united Force of all the Powers on Earth Fain would he save her Honour and prevent her Departure and while his Thoughts were in this Tumult  Hector  who had well weighed the  Grecians  Demand turned to the Envoys and told them that  Cressida  was not a Prisoner and therefore could not be included in the Treaty for Exchange of Prisoners and tell your Princes added he We sell no Women here  Scarce had he uttered these Words when a Murmur of Dislike ran through the whole Assembly which at last broke out into a tumultuous Exclamation against  Hector  for opposing the Return of  Antenor  on account of a Woman  The venerable  Priam  by his Authority put an End to the Contest and declaring that it was his Will the Daughter of  Calchas  should be exchanged for  Antenor  the Assembly broke up satisfied with this determination  Troilus  impatient of the smothered Grief and Rage that tore his inmost Soul hastened to his own Palace with a frantic Air he flew to his Apartment shut every Door and Window and having as much as lay in his Power excluded the hateful Light he threw himself with a deep and deadly Groan upon his Bed there giving a Loose to Sorrow he passionately upbraided the cruel Gods as Authors of his Misfortunes he cursed his Fate the  Greeks  himself and  Troy  Then in the fiercest Transport of his Grief he threw his groveling Body  on the Ground with cruel Blows he beat his groaning Breast tore his dissheveled Hair and abandoned himself to all the wild Excesses of the most confirmed Despair  These Agonies at length subsiding a Calm of Grief ensued again he fell extended on his Bed and in fast heaving Sighs and streaming Tears gave Vent to the Anguish of his labouring Heart  Pandarus  entering his Chamber and finding him in this Condition endeavoured by all the soothing Arts he was Master of to give him Comfort but  Troilus  was deaf to his Persuasions and exasperated rather than soothed by the ineffectual Arguments he urged again his Grief rose up to Frenzy again he uttered Imprecations against the Gods and in the Wildness of his Woe devoted himself to Destruction  Pandarus  terrified at a Despair so vehement threw himself at his Feet and conjured him to moderate his Affliction and take no Resolutions to his own Prejudice till he had consulted  Cressida  and heard what she had to propose adding that he would go immediately to his Niece and take Order for their private Interview  Troilus  listened attentively to this Proposal and a little soothed with the Hopes of seeing  Cressida  pressed  Pandarus  to go that Instant and prepare her to receive him promising his  Confidant to commit no Violence against himself but to acquiesce patiently in what his Mistress should ordain for him  Pandarus  satisfied with this Assurance left him and went to his Niece's House The Report of her being exchanged for  Antenor  had already reached her Ears She was reclined on a Couch in her Chamber pale motionless and bathed in Tears At her Uncle's Approach she newly raised her Head a fresh Stream of Tears gushed from her charming Eyes and passionately clasping her ivory Hands together "Oh Uncle cried she with a Voice almost drowned in thick succeeding Sighs to what Misery hath Love and you introduced me"  Grief prevented her from speaking more her beauteous Head like a Lilly overcharged with Rain sunk again upon her Pillow and a Groan that seemed to rend her lovely Frame to Pieces spoke her Distress more eloquently than the most expressive Words could do  Pandarus  seating himself near her besought her for her Lovers sake whose Grief had almost deprived him of Reason to moderate her Sorrow and give him an Example of Patience and Constancy that might by inciting him to imitate it prevent the fatal Effects of his Despair  Cressida  alarmed for her Lover's Safety and suffering more in his Affliction than her own  summoned up all her Courage in Order to receive him with some Degree of Constancy On his Entrance into her Chamber she rose and met him with an eager Embrace endeavouring by a forced Serenity in her Aspect to dispel that Cloud of Anguish that saddened every Feature but alas her Face that Image of Paradise was pale and wan the rosy Bloom was fled the laughing Loves that used to play upon each dimpled Cheek was gone Tears had dimmed the Lustre of her starry Eyes and all the sprightly Graces that decked her every Look and Motion were lost in languishing Dejection  Troilus  stepping a few Paces back gazed on her for some Moments in an emphatic Silence while the big Sorrow labouring for a Vent so totally oppressed his vital Powers that standing without Sense or Motion he looked like the sad Image of Despair Tears at one Instant gave Relief to both  The Power of Speech returned and they broke into Complaints that might have pierced the most savage and insensible Hearts A thousand Schemes were planned to prevent their Parting but all upon Reflexion proved impracticable The passionate  Troilus  incapable of listning to any Thing but the Dictates of his Love was for leaving his King and Father his distressed Country his weeping Friends blasting that Glory which in so many Wellfought Fields he had acquired and only  sollicitous to preserve his  Cressida  steal with her away from  Troy  and give up all to Love  Cressida  heard this Proposal with Horror she loved his Fame she would not suffer him to sacrifice it to her she represented to him the Weakness and Baseness of such a Resolution and deeply vowed never to consent to any thing that might wound his Honour Hear my  Troilus  added she the only Expedient Fortune has left in our Power suffer me to be sent according to the Decree of the Council to my Father I will carry with me a large Quantity of Treasure which I will pretend was sent to his Care by some of our Relations who intend to take the first Opportunity of escaping to the  Grecian  Camp Before the Truce is expired I will urge him to let me come once more to  Troy  in order to secure the Remainder of our Friends Treasure he is covetous and will be easily prevailed upon on the tenth Day from my Departure you may expect me and once more met nothing but Death shall separate us  Troilus  with Heartbreaking Sighs gave a slow and sad Assent to what she had proposed but full of racking Apprehensions a thousand Times he begged her to be true And she invoking all the celestial Deities the Satyrs Nymphs and Fawns and the infernal Gods imprecated Curses on herself if ever she received a second Love The Morning was now broke with speechless Grief they parted  Troilus  went home to put himself in a condition to attend his beloved  Cressida  to the appointed Place where she was to be exchanged for  Antenor  At his return to her House he found  Diomede  one of the  Grecian  Chiefs with many Attendants waiting her coming out The unhappy Lover could hardly prevent the mingled Rage and Grief that took Posession of his Soul at this Sight from breaking into some Act of Violence against the Man that was going to rob him of all his Soul held dear But mindful of the sacred Truce and more of his  Cressida  's Honour he repressed the rising Fury nor gave the smothered Anguish leave to vent itself in Sighs This painful Restraint lasted not long the beautious  Cressida  appeared and saluting  Diomede  with a languishing Sweetness she gave her Hand to  Troilus  who having helped her on her Horse they rode apart from the rest of the Company and poured out their Souls in mutual protestations of eternal Love and Fidelity  The  Greeks  with  Antenor  appearing in sight  Troilus  was obliged to yield to the sad Necessity of parting Remember oh remember to be true he cried and keep your appointed Day His faultering Tongue could pronounce no more An ashy Paleness overspread his Face he turned away abruptly and joined  Antenor  while  Diomede  eagerly flew to the weeping  Cressida  and conducting her to the  Grecian  Camp left her in the Embraces of her Father The unhappy  Troilus  sinking under  the Weight of an unsupportable Sorrow returned to  Troy  unable to endure the Sight or Conversation of any of his Friends he gave himself wholly up to Solitude and Despair  The ten Days in which she had promised to come back seemed to his impatient Mind as many tedious Ages anxiously he counted the tardy Hours and wondered at their unusual Length now eagerly wishing for the Shades of Night and now as impatient for the rising Dawn  Pandarus  whom only he would admit to his Presence endeavoured to prevail upon him to bear the Absence of his Niece with Moderation and to wait calmly for her Return but the distracted Lover was incapable of following this Advice his Soul was racked between the contrary Extremes of Hope and Fear scarce were four Days of the destined Ten elapsed when wild with Impatience he rode to the Place where she had appointed to meet him there stopping he cast his wishing Eyes around as if he expected to see her and being disappointed returned with languishing Dejection to his Palace and wore away the Night in Sighs and Tears  At length the appointed Day came with fearcheck'd Transport he traced the wellknown Path sending his longing Eyes before to hail the wished Appearance of his  Cressida  and now the whispering Bushes and fleeting Shadows at a Distance would  cheat his Ears and Eyes with her Approach then would he passionately fold his Arms as if already they inclosed her and with an exulting Voice cry out to  Pandarus  She comes my Friend she comes dear lovely faithful  Cressida  oh how shall I repay such wonderous Truth But when Expectation was wearied by Delay and no  Cressida  appeared to confirm the flattering Hope then would he sink into a tender Despondency and chide her Slowness with a Lover's Anger which some new aspiring Hope again removed and gave him up to eager Expectation again to be followed by Disappointment and Despair  The whole Day being past in this continued Succession of Hopes and Fears the Approach of Night brought with it a sad Addition to his Grief for having no longer any Probability of seeing his beloved  Cressida  he resigned himself up to the most cruel Apprehensions ah without doubt she is false he cried the wretched  Troilus  is no more her Care what have I to do but die my  Pandarus  since  Cressida  has forsaken me  Pandarus  tho' greatly surprized at his Niece's Breach of Promise and perhaps suspecting the worst yet anxious to remove from the unhappy Youth that Load of Anguish that seemed ready to overwhelm him invented a hundred Excuses for her Delay which he who dreaded nothing so much as a Confirmation of her Falshood eagerly grasped at and in Compliance with the pressing Instances of his Friend  returned to the City After a Night of agonizing Woe no sooner did the Morning dawn than he arose and flew again to the appointed Place hoping and anxiously wishing he had mistaken the Day on which his  Cressida  had promised to meet him for many successive Days did he continue this Practice living all the while in such a Whirl of contrary Passions as drove him almost to Frenzy  In the mean time  Cressida  whose Violence of Grief had long ago subsided and left only a gentle Sensibility in her Soul that but disposed it for new Impressions having found some Difficulty in prosecuting her Design of returning to  Troy  on the appointed Day resolved to lay aside all Thoughts of such a dangerous Enterprise and began to listen favourably to the Vows of  Diomede  This young Warrior whose Heart the Sight of her in  Troy  had enflamed made Use of all the pleasing Arts with which the God of Love inspires his Votaries to engage her to return his Passion  Cressida  at first would melt into Tears murmur the Name of  Troy  with a Sigh and faintly own she had a Lover there who claimed a Right to her Affection But the gallant Son of  Tydieus  was not so repulsed well did he know the changing Sex and how weak an Obstacle an absent Lover was to those faint Remembrances he opposed his Royal Birth his Fame in Arms his neverdying Passion flattering her Ambition with the Hopes of making her his Queen and her Vanity with an Assurance that  she only could have subdued his Heart He represented to her the certain Destruction that hung over  Troy  and the little Probability there was of her being happy with a Lover of that devoted City  The ungrateful  Cressida  influenced by these selfish Motives forgot or did not regard her Vows of everlasting Faith to  Troilus  and charmed with the Person Valour and exalted Dignity of her new Adorer yielded at length to his Sollicitations nor was the insulting  Greek  satisfied with thus triumphing in secret over his unhappy Rival A rich Jewel which  Troilus  had given to  Cressida  at parting and the abandoned Fair had now bestowed on  Diomede  he wore upon his Armour in the Battle as a Trophy of his Victory and the  Trojan  Prince's Disgrace  Troilus  still pining with Desire and forsaken as he was by  Cressida  yet not capable of thinking her false nourished the fatal Flame that preyed upon his Heart with vain delusive Hopes of her return which though every succeeding Day proved to be illgrounded yet fond of the deceit he still hoped on and like a drowning Wretch grasped eagerly at every faint Relief to avoid that Death which was notwithstanding inevitable  Leaning anxiously one Day over the Walls of the City from whence he sent many a longing Look towards the  Grecian  Camp and breathed Heartbreaking Sighs at the Remembrance  of his  Cressida  he saw a Coat of Mail carried in Triumph before his Brother  Deiphobas  as he was returning from the Field of Battle  This Sight would have had but little Effect on the Heart of the now inglorious Youth sunk as he was in the soft Lethargy of Love consuming away with fruitless Wishes and languishing with disappointed Hope but a Jewel that blazed upon its Sleeve was no sooner observed than it claimed all his Attention the Shape and Size recalling to his Mind the Pledge he gave his  Cressida  at parting With trembling Impatience he fixed his eager Eyes upon it his Heart took the alarm and beat as if it would have left his Breast cold Damps bedewed his shivering Limbs a mortal Paleness overspread his Face yet still insatiate of the Sight he gazed and trembling prayed it might not be what he feared at length a near Approach put it past a doubt that it was the same Jewel that wet with his Tears and hallowed by a thousand tender Invocations he had given his  Cressida  at the sad Moment of their parting thunderstruck at this Conviction of her Falshood wildly he raised his haggard Eyes to Heaven then striking with his Hands his groaning Breast "Oh  Cressida  he cried where where is now thy Faith"  Fixed for a while he stood in silent sad Despair then suddenly looking up he demanded of some of the Soldiers whose Armour that was which his Brother  Deiphobas  had won they  replied it was  Diomedes  Grief giving way to Fury at the Sound of that detested Name he ran transported with a Desire of Vengeance to his Palace there arming himself with a tumultuous Haste he rushed into the Field and with loud Cries called upon  Diomede  seeking his Rival amidst the thickest ranks of his Foes madly he raged about the hostile Field provoking Death and sacrificing whole Hecatombs of slaughtered  Greeks  to his Revenge Rage and Despair rekindling all his martial Heat sent him each Day with more than mortal Courage to the Fight  Pale  Greece  with horror beheld the matchless Chief thinning their Ranks and driving whole Squadrons before his conquering Sword but  Diomede  the partial Gods denied to his Revenge Rivals alike in Glory as in Love they often met oft fought but neither vanquished The Son of  Tideus  was reserved by Fate to meet a more ignoble End at Home and  Troilus  could only fall by the resistless Force of  Achilles  FABLE OF  Troilus  and  Cressida  CRessida  the Daughter of  Calchas  a  Trojan  of Distinction who had fled to the  Grecian  Camp is in Love with and beloved by  Troilus  one of the Sons of  Priam  King of  Troy Pandarus  her Uncle sollicits her in behalf of  Troilus  and gives her up to his Embraces  The  Greeks  having taken  Antenor  Prisoner a  Trojan  Nobleman of great Merit  Calchas  petitions them to exchange him for  Cressida  his Daughter whom he had left behind him in  Troy  His Request is granted the Lovers are obliged to part and  Diomede  when the Exchange is made conducts  Cressida  with whom he falls passionately in Love to the  Grecian  Camp  Hector  sends a Challenge to the  Greeks  inviting the most valiant amongst them to a single Combat  Ajax  accepts it they fight and when parted by the Heralds  Hector  declares that  Ajax  is nearly related to him being Son to his Aunt  This produces mutual Civilities on the Part of each Champion  Ajax  invites  Hector  to the Camp in which Request he is joined by  Agamemnon  and  Achilles Hector  consents the  Trojan  Princes who had attended him to the Field follow him to the General's Tent but  Troilus  eager to see his beloved  Cressida  takes Advantage of this Opportunity to intreat  Ulysses  would conduct him to  Calchas  's Tent  Ulysses  informs him that  Diomede  is in Love with  Cressida  and that he sups there that Night  Troilus  thereupon stands concealed to observe their Behaviour  Cressida  after coquetting a little with  Diomede  makes an Assignation with him and he demanding a Pledge she gives him a Sleeve which she had received from  Troilus  but refusing to tell him to whom it belonged he declares he will wear it on his Helmet the next Day in Battle that he may sacrifice the Person who claims it to his Revenge  As soon as he is gone  Cressida  in a Soliloquy professes that she no longer loves  Troilus  and that  Diomede  is Master of her Heart  Troilus  in a Transport of Grief and Rage exclaims against her Inconstancy vows to take  ample Vengeance on his Rival and the next Day in Battle performs such wonderful Acts of Valour that the  Grecians  are almost put to flight  Achilles  having absented himself from the Field in compliance with the Commands of  Polyxena Priam  's Daughter with whom he is in Love and carries on a secret Correspondence  Hector  who had been warn'd in vain to desist from fighting that Day rages uncontrouled through the Field at length having killed  Patroclus Achilles  to revenge the Death of his Friend arms and rushes into the Battle  Hector  observing a  Greek  in Golden Armour fights with him and wins it and satisfied with the Exploits of the Day is beginning to disarm himself when  Achilles  at the Head of his Myrmidons appears  Hector  in vain pleads that he is unarmed and taken at a Disadvantage  Achilles  commands his Myrmidons to surround and slay him that done he ties his Body to his Horse's Tail and drags it through the  Grecian  Army  Troilus  brings the News of  Hector  's Death to the  Trojans  and leads them back to  Troy  while the  Grecian  Army satisfied with the Death of  Hector  sound a Retreat and suffer their Enemy quietly to reenter their City  The Story of this Play is partly taken from  Chaucer  's Poem of  Troilus  and  Cressida  and  partly from an old Story Book called  The three Destructions of  Troy  The first furnished  Shakespear  with the Love Plot and the second with all the Incidents that relate to the War  This Play has been severely censured on account of the Faults of its Plot if that can be called a Plot which is only a Succession of Incidents without Order Connexion or any Dependance upon each other as well as the Inequality of the Manners the Poet has given to his Persons  The Loves of  Troilus  and  Cressida  are in all the Circumstances exactly copied from  Chaucer  but these Circumstances are intirely detached from the rest of the Play and produce no Event worthy our Attention  Troilus  and  Cressida  give Name to the Tragedy and by Consequence are the most considerable Persons in it yet  Troilus  is left alive and  Cressida  too scandalous a Character to draw our Pity does not satisfy that Detestation her Crimes raise in us by her Death but escaping Punishment leaves the Play without a Moral and absolutely deficient in poetical Justice  The Manners of these two Persons however ought to escape the general Charge of Inequality  Troilus  who is drawn exactly after  Chaucer  is every where consistent with his Character of a brave Soldier and a passionate and faithful Lover  From  Cressida  's first and second Appearance we may easily guess what her future Conduct will be the deep Art with which she conceals her Passion for  Troilus  her loose Conversation with her Uncle her free Coquettry with the Prince and her easy yielding to his Addresses prepare us for her Falshood in the succeeding Part of the Play and all together make up the Character of a compleat Jilt Her not being punished is indeed an unpardonable Fault and brings the greatest Imputation imaginable upon  Shakespear  's Judgment who could introduce so vicious a Person in a Tragedy and leave her without the due Reward of her Crimes  The Character of  Cressida  is much more consistent in  Shakespear  than  Chaucer  the latter represents her wise humble and modest nicely sensible of Fame fond of her Country not easily susceptible of Love hard to be won and rather betrayed than yielding to the Desires of her Lover  With all these amiable Qualities to engage our Esteem and those alleviating Circumstances that attended her Fall with  Troilus  we cannot without Surprize see her so soon changing her Love violating her Vows and  basely prostituting her Honour to  Diomede  The inequality of Manners here is very observable but  Shakespear  in drawing her Character has avoided falling into the same Fault by copying  Chaucer  too closely and  Cressida  throughout the Play is always equal and consistent with herself  That the old Story Book called  The three Destructions of  Troy furnished  Shakespear  with the other Part of the Plot is plain from several of the Incidents being exactly copied from thence Thus he makes  Achilles  to be in Love with  Polyxena  the Daughter of  Priam  and this Passion to be the Cause of his refusing to fight against the  Trojans  and  Hector  to be cowardly killed by  Achilles  as he was intent on spoiling a  Greek  of his Golden Armour which he had eagerly sought after in the Battle  This Circumstance however  Shakespear  has altered greatly for the worse The Story says that  Hector  having slain  Patroclus  and performed many wonderful Acts of Valour satisfied with the Slaughters of the Day was going to quit the Field when happening to see a  Greek  with a compleat Suit of Golden Armour on his Avarice was awakened and he resolved not to quit the Battle till he had gained this rich Prize accordingly he assaulted the  Greek  took him Prisoner and to lead him more easily out of the Throng cast his Shield behind him  Achilles  whom the Death of  Patroclus  had brought into the Field burning with a Desire of Revenge on  Hector  hastened to seize him at this Disadvantage and gave him a Blow with his Spear which killed him  Shakespear  makes  Hector  in the same Manner eager to win this Suit of Armour but after he has slain the  Greek  who owned it he disarms himself in the Field of Battle and  Achilles  and his Myrmidons coming up they all surround him fall upon him and kill him  Thus has  Shakespear  made  Achilles  a greater Coward than the old Story Writer for in the latter he only takes Advantage of his Enemy's Shield being thrown behind him to give him a Wound but  Shakespear  makes him employ all his Myrmidons to kill one Man and he disarmed and calling for Mercy  The Absurdity of  Hector  's unarming himself in the Field of Battle with all his Foes about him in order to facilitate this wonderful Enterprize is too gross to need any Remark  Hector  's challenging any of the  Grecian  Princes to single Combat in Honour of their Ladies Beauty is a Circumstance borrowed from the Story Book but surely very injudiciously The following Message from the Defender of  Troy  a City almost ruined by a War of nine Years Continuance can hardly be read without a Smile  We have great  Agamemnon  here in  Troy  A Prince call'd  Hector Priam  is his Father  Who in this dull and longcontinued Truce  Is rusty grown he bade me take a Trumpet  And to this Purpose speak Kings Princes Lords  If there be one amongst the fairest of  Greece  That holds his Honour higher than his Ease  That seeks his Praise more than he fears his Peril  That knows his Valour and knows not his Fear  That loves his Mistress more than in Confession  With truant Vows to her own Lips he loves  And dare avow her Beauty and her Worth  In other Arms than hers To him this Challenge  Hector  in view of  Trojans  and of  Greeks  Shall make it good or do his best to do it  He hath a Lady wiser fairer truer  Than ever  Greek  did compass in his Arms  And will tomorrow with his Trumpet call  Midway between your Tents and Walls of  Troy  To rouze a  Grecian  that is true in Love  If any come  Hector  will honour him  If none he'll say in  Troy  when he retires  The  Grecian  Dames are Sunburnt and not worth  The Splinter of a Lanceeven so much  Aeneas  begins with telling the  Grecian  Princes that in  Troy  they have a Prince called  Hector  and that  Priam  is his Father as if the Name and Quality of this redoubted Hero the Bulwark  of the  Trojans  and the Terror of the  Grecians  could be unknown to them  Shakespear  in this Passage contradicts himself as well as Commonsense for we find afterwards that they acknowledged the Valour of  Hector  to be so great that none but  Achilles  was thought an equal Match for him and  Ajax  was urged to accept the Challenge in order to raise the Jealousy of the discontented  Achilles  Aeneas  also tells them that their Champion is grown rusty during the dull and long continued Truce yet in the foregoing Scene the  Trojan  Heroes are represented returning from the Battle and after that we find no mention of a Truce or any Interval allowed to make it be supposed there had been one How then comes it that  Aeneas  here speaks of a Truce But these Blunders are very frequent in  Shakespear  The Poet likewise following the old Story Writer makes  Hector  and  Ajax  CousinGermans but in the Play  Ajax  as it would seem knows nothing of the Matter till he is told of it first by  Aeneas  and afterwards by  Hector  and then when the Combat is ended the two Heroes Embrace and 'tis nothing but Cousin and Cousin at every Word  The Story tells us that  Achilles  had a longing Desire to see  Hector  unarmed  Shakespear  makes use of this Thought  Achilles  says in the Play to his Friend  I have a Woman's Longing  An Appetite that I am sick withal  To see great  Hector  in the Weeds of Peace  The Conversation of these two Heroes when they meet which consists of mutual Threatnings doubtless gave  Shakespear  the Hint for that characteristic Discourse they hold together in the Play  Tho'  Shakespear  consulted this Book for Part of his Plot yet in drawing the Characters of his  Grecian  Princes I cannot help thinking he had  Homer  in his Eye and probably saw some old Translation of that Poet for there was one in his Time  Achilles  indeed is a Character of his own Invention ridiculous and inconstant to the last Degree Brave and a Coward a Fool yet a deep and accurate Reasoner But in the others he seems to have endeavoured at an Imitation of  Homer  Thus he makes  Diomede  bold and enterprizing  Ulysses  wise and artful  Nestor  narrative and ever ready to expatiate on his past Exploits  Thersites  cowardly satyrical witty and malicious In the Interview between the  Greek  and  Trojan  Princes he makes them all speak with great Propriety and suitable to their respective Characters  Hector  indeed by mentioning  Helen  ludicrously to the injured  Menelaas  who had given him a free and soldierlike Greeting discovers in that Instance neither the Manners of a Prince or Warrior but this is only a Slip for his Discourse both before and after it is quite agreeable to his Character  The Silence of  Troilus  in this Scene is beautifully imagined The Poet makes this passionate Prince attend  Hector  to the  Grecian  Tents whither he is invited only with a Design of seeing his beloved  Cressida  but his Resentment towards the Enemies of his Country being heightened by the Consideration of their having deprived him of his Mistress he is incapable of mixing in the Conversation or even of returning the Civilities of the  Grecian  Princes he stands at a Distance pensive silent wholly absorb'd in melancholly Reflections The Grief of this young Lover is finely marked by  Agamemnon  in that short Question to  Ulysses  pointing him out  What  Trojan  is that same that looks so heavy  However ridiculous inconsistent and contrary to general Opinion  Shakespear  has drawn the Character of  Achilles  in this Play yet in the following Lines he must have had  Homer  in his View The  Grecian  Army is almost routed by the  Trojans  the Commanders in the utmost Consternation when  Ulysses  enters and thus reassures them  Oh Courage Courage Princes great  Achilles  Is arming weeping cursing vowing Vengeance  Patroclus'  Wounds have rous'd his drousy Blood  Here  Achilles  is made of so much Importance to the  Grecians  that vanquished as they were and flying from the Field they no sooner heard that  Achilles  is arming and coming to join them than their Courage is reanimated they renew the Fight and Victory declares for them Only  Homer  could have furnished  Shakespear  with this Thought nor with an Idea of  Achilles  's Grief for the Death of  Patroclus  which in two Lines he has so pathetically described The old Story which in many Places he has faithfully copied is absolutely silent here  The Speech of  Calchas  to the  Grecian  Princes demanding their  Trojan  Prisoner  Antenor  to be exchanged for his Daughter  Cressida  is almost literally taken from  Chaucer  The Character of  Pandarus  also is borrowed from him but much heightened by  Shakespear  Part of the Conversation between  Pandarus  and his Niece is copied exactly from  Chaucer  PLAN OF King  Richard  the Second  THE Action of this Play begins with  Bolingbroke  's appealing the Duke of  Norfolk  on an Accusation of High Treason The King after having in vain attempted to reconcile them permits them according to the Custom of that Time to decide the Contest with their Swords  On the Day appointed the King and his Nobles being seated in the Lists the two Champions appear in Armour and the King suddenly throwing down his Warder forbids the Combat and pronounces a Sentence of Banishment on both but with this Difference that  Bolingbroke  should remain in Exile during ten Years four of which he afterwards remits at the Intercession of his Father  John  of  Gaunt    but the Duke of  Norfolk  he commands on Pain of Death never to return  John  of  Gaunt  dying soon after the King seizes his Plate Money and Lands to furnish Necessaries for the  Irish  War in which he was then engaged and setting sail for  Ireland  leaves his Kingdom in great Confusion The King's injurious Treatment of the banished  Bolingbroke  by thus depriving him of his legal Possessions draws great Numbers to that Nobleman's Party who being assisted likewise by a foreign Force lands in  England  and there declaring that his only Motives for returning to his native Country in Arms were to get his undeserved Banishment repealed to require the Restitution of those Goods of which he had been unjustly deprived and to claim the Dukedom of  Lancaster  descended to him by the Death of his Father he is joined by all the disaffected Nobility  The Duke of  York  his Uncle and Guardian of the Realm in the King's Absence having no Forces to oppose him and conscious of the Wrongs he had suffered remains neuter  The King returns and falling into the Hands of  Bolingbroke  is carried to  London  prevailed upon to resign his Crown and afterwards confined in  Pomfret  Castle  The Duke of  Aumarle  Son to the Duke of  York  the Abbot of  Westminster  the Bishop of  Carlisle  and some other Lords join in a Conspiracy  to murder the new King at  Oxford  The Duke of  York  discovers it by means of a Paper he had snatched from his Son and hastening to the King reveals the Plot and demands Justice on his Son but  Aumarle  had been before him and secured his Pardon  Bolingbroke  alarmed at this Conspiracy drops some Words which express a Wish that some one would dispatch King  Richard  this being observed by  Exton  he goes to  Pomfret  Castle kills the unhappy King and brings his Body to  Bolingbroke  which puts an End to the Play  Tho' this Play is called  The Life and Death of  Richard  the Second  yet the Action of it takes in but little more than the two last Years of his Reign  Shakespear  seems to have consulted  Holingshed  chiefly for the Facts on which it is built and has followed him pretty closely The Speech of the Bishop of  Carlisle  in the fourth Act is apparently copied from  Holingshed  Shakespear  introduces the Duke of  York  as bringing from King  Richard  a Resignation o  his Crown to  Bolingbroke  who declaring that he will ascend the Regal Throne  Carlisle  replies  CARLISLE  Marry Heaven forbid  Worst in this Royal Presence may I speak  Yet best beseeming me to speak the Truth▪  Would God that any in this noble Presence  Were enough noble to be upright Judge  Of noble  Richard  then true Nobleness would  Learn him Forbearance from so foul a Wrong  What Subject can give Sentence on his King  And who sits here that is not  Richard  's Subject  Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear  Altho' apparent Guilt be seen in them  And shall the Figure of God's Majesty  His Captain Steward Deputy elect  Anointed crown'd and planted many Years  Be judg'd by subject and inferior Breath  And he himself not present Oh forbid it  That in a Christian Climate Souls refin'd  Should shew so heinous black obscene a Deed  I speak to Subjects and a Subject speaks  Stirr'd up by Heav'n thus boldly for his King  My Lord of  Hereford  here whom you call King  Is a foul Traitor to proud  Hereford  's King  And if you crown him let me prophesy  The Blood of  English  shall manure the Ground  And future Ages groan for this foul Act  Peace shall go sleep with  Turks  and Infidels  And in this Seat of Peace tumultuous Wars  Shall Kin with Kin and Kind with Kind confound  Disorder Horror Fear and Mutiny  Shall here inhabit and this Land be call'd  The Field of  Golgotha  and dead Men's Sculls  Oh if you rear this House against this House  It will the wofullest Division prove  That ever fell upon this cursed Earth  Prevent resist it let it not be so  Left Children's Children cry against you Woe  Thus it stands in  Holingshed  Page "On Wednesday following Request was made by the Commons That sith King  Richard  had resigned and was lawfully deposed from his Royal Dignity he might have Judgment decreed against him so as the Realm were not troubled by him and that the Causes of his deposing might be published through the Realm for satisfying the People Which Demand was granted  Whereupon the Bishop of  Carlisle  a Man both learned wise and stout of Stomach boldly shewed forth his Opinion concerning that Demand affirming that there was none amongst them worthy or meet to give Judgment upon so worthy a Prince as King  Richard  was whom they had taken for their Sovereign and Liege Lord for the Space of two and twenty Years and more and I assure you said he there is not so rank a Traitor nor so errant a Thief nor yet so cruel a Murderer apprehended or detained in Prison for his Offence but he shall be brought before the Justice to hear his Judgment and wil ye proceed to the Judgment of an anointed King heari  g neither his Answer nor Excuse I say that the Duke of  Lancaster  whom ye call King hath more trespassed to King  Richard  and his Realm than King  Richard  hath done either to him or us for it is manifest and well known that the Duke was banished the Realm by King  Richard  and his Council and by the Judgment of his own Father for the Space of ten Years for what Cause ye know and yet without Licence of King  Richard  he is returned again into the Realm and what is worse hath taken upon him the Name Title and Preheminence of King and therefore I say that you have done manifest Wrong to proceed in any Thing against King  Richard  without calling him openly to his Answer and Defence"  "As soon as the Bishop had ended this Tale he was attached by the Earl Marshal and committed to Ward in the Abbey of  Saint Albans"  It has been observed that  Shakespear  in his Historical Plays was a close Copier of the Histories from whence he took them yet in  Richard  the Second there are some Deviations and some Omissions that throw different Lights on the Characters of his Persons and tend greatly to mislead our Judgments in the Opinions we Form of them  The Murder of the Duke of  Gloucester  Uncle to the King is one of the Crimes that  Bolingbroke  charges on the Duke of  Norfolk  the King in many Passages of the Play is said to have commanded it The old Duke of  Lancaster  upbraids him with having shed the Blood of the great  Edward  and  Richard  's Silence to that Accusation is not only a tacit Confession of the Guilt but a Proof that he had nothing to offer in Vindication of it  In the History it is not absolutely clear that King  Richard  had any part in the Death of his Uncle but 'tis certain that the Duke of  Gloucester  was engaged in several Conspiracies against him and that the King having discovered a dangerous One in which not only his Crown and Dignity but his Life was aimed at he found himself under a Necessity of seizing his disloyal Uncle which he did by a well contrived Stratagem at his own Castle and sent him to  Calais  where he confessed all his Treasons and was assassinated as some Report by  Richard  's Order  Shakespear  's Silence upon this Head is very unfavourable to the Character of  Richard  on whom by that Means he draws the Imputation of a Murderer and Paracide and yet in his Misfortunes he proposes him as an Object of Compassion and makes Use of all his pathetic Powers to melt the Souls of the Audience in his Favour  The Historians say that  Bolingbroke  when in Banishment was invited by the chief Nobility in  England  to return and force the Crown from  Richard  whom they judged unworthy to Reign  Shakespear  takes no Notice of this Circumstance but makes  Bolingbroke  on his Arrival declare that he only came to demand a Restitution of the Honours and Estates he had been  unjustly deprived of and the Lords join him upon this Supposition  In the History we are told that King  Richard  finding himself abandoned by many of his Friends his  Welsh  Army on whom he had the greatest Confidence dispersed and  Bolingbroke  absolute Master of his People's Hearts retired to  Conway  Castle which he determined to hold as long as it was possible thither the Earl of  Northumberland  came from  Bolingbroke  with Offers of Submission on his Part provided the King would pardon what was past repeal his Banishment and restore him to all his Rights and Dignities  King  Richard  being persuaded to accept of these Conditions and to go to  Rutland  to confer with  Bolingbroke  falls into an Ambush prepared for him and is led Prisoner to  London  Shakespear  drops the Circumstance of the Ambush laid for the King and represents  Bolingbroke  confering in a submissive Manner with him at  Flint  Castle and the King upon his Cousin's solemn Assurance of attempting nothing against his Crown and Dignity willingly accompanies him to  London  where at a meeting of the Parliament he is deposed and the Crown offered to  Bolingbroke  This Play affords several other Instances in which  Shakespear  's Inattention to the History is plainly proved and is therefore the less pardonable as the Subject of it is not one entire  Action wrought up with a Variety of beautiful Incidents which at once delight and instruct the Mind but a Dramatick Narration of Historical Facts and a successive Series of Actions and Events which are only interesting as they are true and only pleasing as they are gracefully told  The Manner of  Bolingbroke  's appealing the Duke of  Norfolk  the Order of the intended Combat the very Words of the Appellant and Defendant the Behaviour and Speech of the King on that Occasion are exactly copied from  Holingshed  as is likewise the Appeals of the Lords in the first Scene of the fourth Act  The Duke of  York  's Conduct throughout the Play is the same as the History represents it only  Shakespear  has aggravated his Zeal to the newmade King by introducing him eager and solicitous to procure the Death of his Son  Aumarle  for having engaged in a Conspiracy against him  The Impropriety of making a Father press so ardently the Execution of a beloved Son because that Son had joined with a Party that had resolved to dethrone an Usurper and restore the lawful King is too glaring to need any Animadversion But because there is something truly ludicrous in this very tragical Passage I shall transcribe it  Aumarle  finding his Father determined to disclose his Treason to the new King hastens  to Court and procuring a private Audience gets a Promise of Pardon from the King While he is closetted with him the Duke of  York  arrives and loudly demands Admittance  YORK  Open the Door secure foolhardy King  Shall I for Love speak Treason to thy Face  Open the Door or I will break it open  Enter  YORK  BOLINGBROKE  What is the Matter Uncle speak take Breath  Tell us how near is Danger  That we may arm us to encounter it  YORK  Peruse this Writing here and thou shalt know  The Treason that my Haste forbids me show  AUMARLE  Remember as thou read'st thy Promise past  I do repent me read not my Name there  My Heart is not Confed'rate with my Hand  YORK  Villain it was ere thy Hand set it down  I tore it from the Traytor's Bosom King  Fear and not Love begets his Penitence  Forget to pity him lest thy Pity prove  A Serpent that will sting thee to the Heart  BOLINGBROKE  O heinous strong and bold Conspiracy  O loyal Father of a treach'rous Son  Thou clear immaculate and silver Fountain  From whence this Stream thro' muddy Passages  Hath had

And he shall spend mine Honour with his Shame  As thriftless Sons their scraping Fathers' Gold  Mine Honour lives when his Dishonour dies  Or my sham'd Life in his Dishonour lies  Thou kill'st me in his Life giving him Breath  The Traytor lives the true Man's put to Death  DUTCHESS  within  DUTCHESS  What ho my Liege for Heaven's sake let me in  BOLINGBROKE  What shrillvoic'd Suppliant makes this

saying Pardon doth not pardon twain  But makes one Pardon strong  The Word is short but not so short as sweet  No Word like Pardon for Kings Mouth so meet  YORK  Speak it in  French  say King  Pardonnez moy  That little Fiction which  Shakespear  has introduced into this Play is imagined with his usual Carelesness and Inattention to Probability The Queen who more than any other Person is interested in every thing that relates  to the King her Husband is nevertheless the last that hears of the Seizure of her Lord  In the second Act she is informed of  Bolingbroke  's Invasion and the Dissaffection of almost all the Nobility and in the fourth this sorrowful Queen is introduced in her Garden with two Ladies who press her to dance  The Gardener and two Workmen entering she retires behind the Trees in Hopes of learning some News of the State from them nor is she deceived From them she first hears of the Imprisonment and intended Deposition of the King her Husband  One might be surprised perhaps to hear from a Gardener's Mouth a beautiful System of Politics couched in a close and wellconceived Allegory drawn from such Images as his Profession furnished him with if the poor Fellow who works under his Directions did not allegorize as well as his Master and lessen the Wonder  SERVANT  Why should we in the Compass of a Pale  Keep Law and Form and due Proportion  Shewing as in a Model our firm State  When our Seawalled Garden the whole Land  Is full of Weeds her fairest Flowers choak'd up  Her Fruittrees all unprun'd her Hedges ruin'd  Her Knots disorder'd and her wholesome Herbs  Swarming with Caterpillars  The Manner of King  Richard  's Death is differently related by the Historians  Shakespear  follows  Thomas Walsingham  's Account of that barbarous Parricide as quoted by  Holingshed  how closely he has copied the Circumstances and even some of the Speeches may be seen by comparing the Passages as they stand in the Historian and Poet  "One Writer says  Holingshed  Page which seemeth to have great Knowledge of King  Richard  's Doings saith That King  Henry  sitting one Day at his Table are sighing said Have I no faithful Friend which will deliver me of him whose Life will be my Death and whose Death will be the Preservation of my Life  This Saying was much noted of them which were present and especially of one called Sir  Pierce  of  Exton  This Knight incontinently departed from the Court with eight strong Persons in his Company and came to  Pomfret  commanding the Esquire that was accustomed to serve and take the Assay before King  Richard  to do so no more saying Let him eat now for he shall not long eat  King  Richard  sat down to Dinner and was served without Curtesy or Assay whereupon much marvelling at the sudden Change he demanded  of the Esquire why he did not his Duty Sir said he I am otherwise commanded by Sir  Pierce  of  Exton  which is newly come from King  Henry  When King  Richard  heard that Word he took the Carving Knife in his Hand and struck the Esquire on the Head saying The Devil take  Henry  of  Lancaster  and thee together and with that Word Sir  Pierce  entered the Chamber well armed with eight tall Men likewise armed every one of them having a Bill in his Hand King  Richard  perceiving this put the Table from him and stepping to the foremost Man wrung the Bill out of his Hands and so valiantly defended himself that he slew four of those that thus came to assail him Sir  Pierce  being half dismayed herewith leaped into the Chair where King  Richard  was wont to sit while the other four Persons fought with him and chased him about the Chamber and in Conclusion as King  Richard  traversed his Ground from one Side of the Chamber to another and coming by the Chair where Sir  Pierce  stood he was felled with a Stroke of a Pollax which Sir  Pierce  gave him upon the Head and therewith rid him out of Life without giving him Respite once to call to God for Mercy of his past Offences  It is said that Sir  Pierce  of  Exton  after he had thus slain him wept right bitterly as one stricken with the Prick of a guilty Conscience  for murdering him whom he had so long time obeyed as King"  Enter  EXTON  and a Servant  EXTON  Didst thou not mark the King what Words he spake  "Have I no Friend will rid me of this living Fear"  Was it not so  SERVANT  These were his very Words  EXTON  "Have I no Friend"quoth he he spake it twice  And urg'd it twice together did he not  SERVANT  He did  EXTON  And speaking it he wistly look'd on me  As who shall sayI would thou wert the Man  That would divorce this Terror from my Heart  Meaning the King at  Pomfret  Come lets go  I am the King's Friend and we'll rid his Foe  Scene changed to the Prison at  Pomfret  Enter to the  KING  the

what means Death in this rude Assault  Wretch thine own Hand yields thy Death's Instrument  Snatching a Sword  Go thou and fill another Room in Hell  Kills another  Exton  strikes him down  That Hand shall burn in neverquenching Fire  That staggers thus my Person Thy  Pierce  Hand  Hath with the Kings Blood stain'd the Kings own Land  Mount mount my Soul thy Seat is up on high  Whilst my gross Flesh sinks downward here to die  Dies  EXTON  As full of Valour as of Royal Blood  Both have I spilt Oh would the Deed were good  For now the Devil that told me I did well  Says that this Deed is chronicled in Hell  This dead King to the living King I'll bear  Take hence the rest and give them Burial here  The History goes on to relate that King  Richard  's Body was carried through the City to  St Paul  's Cathedral with the Face uncovered and lay in that Manner three Days exposed to the View of the People  Shakespear  makes  Exton  bring the Corps in a Coffin to the Court present it to the King in the Presence of several of his Nobility and tell him that his Commands had been obeyed  This absurdity is followed by the King's confessing that he had given such Orders but that he now repented of them and after driving the Murderer from his Presence he weeps over the dead King and pacifies his Conscience with a Vow to make a Voyage to the Holy Land to expiate his Guilt  PLAN Of the FIRST PART of  Henry  the Fourth  IN this Play  Shakespear  takes up the History exactly where he left it in  Richard  the Second  Bolingbroke  now King  Henry  the Fourth is prevented from making a Voyage to the Holy Land which he had vowed by a Conspiracy formed against him by some of those Lords whose Assistance had enabled him to usurp the Throne  The brave  Piercy  surnamed  Hotspur  having refused to surrender his  Scotch  Prisoners taken in the Battle of  Holmedon  to the King who also in return denies to ransom his Brother in Law  Mortimer  from the  Welsh  Rebel  Owen Glendower  a Quarrel ensues  Piercy  and the other discontented Noblemen join with the  Scots  and  Glendower  they raise an Army and march to meet the King at  Shrewsbury  The King sends to treat with the Rebels  Piercy  being disposed to listen to an Accommodation Commissions his Uncle the Earl of  Worcester  to propose Terms to the King  Worcester  out of an Opinion that  Henry  could never be thoroughly reconciled to them and would take an other Opportunity to be revenged treacherously conceals the King's favourable Offers and tells  Piercy  that he is resolved to fight  Then follows the Battle in which the brave  Piercy  is slain by the wild Prince of  Wales  The King's Party is victorious the treacherous  Worcester  being made Prisoner is condemned to die and the King dividing his Forces sends one Part under the Command of his second Son to meet the Earl of  Northumberland  at  York  and himself and the Prince of  Wales  march against the Rebel  Glendower  and the Earl of  March  The Transactions contained in this Historical Drama are comprized in the Space of ten Months The Action of it commences with the News of  Hotspur  's having defeated the  Scots  under  Archibald  Earl of  Douglas  at  Holmedon  which Battle was fought on  HolyroodDay  the th of  September  and is closed with the Defeat and Death of  Hotspur  at  Shrewsbury  which Engagement happened the st of  July    Shakespear  has copied  Holingshed  very closely as well in the Historical Facts as the Characters of his Persons  Piercy  's and  Glendower  's are indeed greatly heightened but both with wonderful Propriety and Beauty The Episodical Part of the Drama which is made up of the extravagant Sallies of the Prince of  Wales  and the inimitable Humour of  Falstaff  is entirely of his own Invention The Character of Prince  Henry  tho' drawn after the Historians is considerably improved by  Shakespear  and through the Veil of his Vices and Irregularities we see a Dawn of Greatness and Virtue that promises the future Splendor of his Life and Reign  The Poet has indeed deviated from History in making this young Prince kill the gallant  Piercy  at the Battle of  Shrewsbury  According to them it is uncertain by whom he fell however this Circumstance is beautifully imagined by  Shakespear  in order to exalt the Character of Prince  Henry  which had before been obscured by the Glory of that Heroe  The King in recounting the great Exploits of  Hotspur  thus opposes his Character to that of his Son  K HENRY  Yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin  In envy that my Lord  Northumberland  Should be the Father of so blest a Son  A Son who is the Theme of Honour's Tongue  Amongst a Grove the very straightest Plant  Who is sweet Fortune's Minion and her Pride  Whilst I by looking on the Praise of him  See riot and dishonour stain the Brow  Of my young  Harry  O could it be proved  That some Night tripping Fairy had exchang'd  In CradleCloaths our Children where they lay  And call'd mine  Piercy  his  Plantagenet  Then would I have his  Harry  and he mine  But the Poet even by making this Contrast has still the Glory of his Favourite in View the Conqueror of  Piercy  must needs be greater than  Piercy  himself Prince  Henry  therefore must be acknowledged to be the Heroe of this Play for the Lawrels of his Rival are all transfered to him with the additional Wreath of having conquered that Rival  THE LIFE OF King  Henry  the Fifth  THE Transactions comprised in this Historical Play commence about the latter End of the first and terminate in the eighth Year of this King's Reign when he married the Princess  Catharine  of  France  and put an End to the Differences betwixt  England  and that Crown  The Siege and taking of  Harfleur  the Battle of  Agincourt  the Peace concluded between King  Henry  and the  French  King with the Marriage of the former to the Princess of  France  are the principal Actions of this Play and are taken from  Holingshed  's Chronicle after whom the Characters are likewise drawn with very little Variation  The Archbishop's Speech to King  Henry  in the first Act in which he explains his Title to the Crown of  France  is closely copied from this Historian  Page    "Herein did he much enveie against the surmised and false fained Law  Salike  which the  Frenchmen  allege ever against the Kings of  England  in barre of their just Title to the Crown of  France  The verie Words of that supposed Law are these  In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant  That is to say Into the Salike Land let not Women succeed Which the  French  Glossers expound to be the Realme of  France  and that this Law was made by King  Pharamond  whereas yet their own Authors affirme that the Land  Salike  is in  Germany  between the Rivers  Elbe  and  Sala  and that when  Charles  the Great had overcome the  Saxons  he placed there certain  Frenchmen  which having in disdain the dishonest Manners of the  German  Women made a Law that the Females should not succeed to any Inheritance within that Land which at this Day is called  Meisen  So that if this be true this Law was not made for the Realme of  France  nor the  Frenchmen  possessed the Land  Salike  till four hundred and one and twenty Years after the Death of  Pharamond  the supposed Author of this  Salike  Law for this  Pharamond  deceased in the Year and  Charles  the Great subdued the  Saxons  and placed the  Frenchmen  in those Parts beyond the River of  Sala  in the Year  Moreover it appeareth by their own Writers that King  Pepen  which deposed  Childerike  claimed the Crown of  France  as Heir general for that he was descended of  Blithila  Daughter of King  Clothair  the first  Hugh Capet  also who usurped the Crown upon  Charles  Duke of  Loraine  the sole Heirmale of the Line and Stocke of  Charles  the Great to make his Title seem true and appear good though indeed it was starke naught conceived himself as Heir to the Ladie  Lingard  Daughter to King  Charlemain  Sonne to  Lewis  the Emperor that was Sonne to  Charles  the Great King  Lewis  also the tenth otherwise also called Saint  Lewis  being verie Heir to the Usurper  Hugh Capet  could never be satisfied in his Conscience how he might justly keep and possesse the Crowne of  France  till he was persuaded and fully instructed that Queene  Isabell  his Grandmother was lineally descended of the Ladie  Ormengard  Daughter and Heir to the above named  Charles  Duke of  Loraine  by the which Marriage the Blood and Line of  Charles  the Great was again united and restored to the Crowne and Scepter of  France  So that more clear than the Sun it openly appeareth that the Title of King  Pepen  the Claim of  Hugh Capet  the Possession of  Lewis  yea and the  French  Kings to this Day are derived and conveyed from the Heirsfemale though they would under the Colour of such a feigned Law barre the Kings and Princes of this Realme of  England  of their right and lawful Inheritance  The Archbishop further alleged out of the Book of  Numbers  this Saying  When a Man dieth without a Son let the Inheritance descend to his Daughter  At length having said sufficiently for the Proof of the King's just and lawful Title to the Crown of  France  he exhorted him to advance forth his Banner to fight for his Right to conquer his Inheritance to spare neither Blood Sword nor Fire sith his War was just his Cause good and his Claim true and to the Intent his loving Chaplains and obedient Subjects of the Spiritualtie might shew themselves willing and desirous to aid his Majesty for the Recovery of his ancient Right and true Inheritance the Archbishop declared that in their Spiritual Convocation they had granted to his Highness such a Summe of Money as never by no spiritual Persons was to any Prince before those Days given or advanced"  Holingshed  CANTERBURY  Then hear me gracious Sovereign and you Peers  That owe your Lives your Faith and Services  To this imperial Throne There is no Bar  To make against your Highness' Claim to  France  But this which they produce from  Pharamond    In Terra Salicam Mulieres ne succedant    No Woman shall succeed in  Salike  Land  Which  Salike  Land the  French  unjustly gloze  To be the Realm of  France  and  Pharamond  The Founder of this Law and female Bar  Yet their own Authors faithfully affirm  That the Land  Salike  lies in  Germany  Between the Floods of  Sala  and of  Elve  Where  Charles  the Great having subdued the  Saxons  There left behind and settled certain  French  Who holding in Disdain the  German  Women  For some dishonest Manners of their Life  Establish'd then this Law to wit no Female  Should be Inheretrix in  Salick  Land  Which  Salick  as I said 'twixt  Elve  and  Sala  Is at this Day in  Germany  called  Meisens  Thus doth it well appear the  Salick  Law  Was not devised for the Realm of  France    Nor did the  French  possess the  Salick  Land  Untill four hundred one and twenty Years  After Defunction of King  Pharamond  Idly suppos'd the Founder of this Law  Who died within the Year of our Redemption  Four hundred twentysix and  Charles  the Great  Subdu'd the  Saxons  and did seat the  French  Beyond the River  Sala  in the Year  Eight hundred five Besides their Writers say  King  Pepen  which deposed  Childerick  Did as Heirgeneral being descended  Of  Blithild  which was Daughter to King  Clothair    Make Claim and Title to the Crown of  France  Hugh Capet  also who usurp'd the Crown  Of  Charles  the Duke of  Lorain  sole Heirmale  Of the true Line and Stock of  Charles  the Great  To fine his Title with some Shews of Truth  Though in pure Truth it was corrupt and naught  Convey'd himself as Heir to th'Lady  Lingar  Daughter to  Charlemain  who was the Son  To  Lewis  the Emperor which was the Son  Of  Charles  the Great Also King  Lewis  the Ninth  Who was sole Heir to the Usurper  Capet  Could not keep Quiet in his Conscience  Wearing the Crown of  France  till satisfy'd  That fair Queen  Isabel  his Grandmother  Was lineal of the Lady  Ermengere  Daughter to  Charles  the foresaid Duke of  Lorrain    By the which Match the Line of  Charles  the Great  Was reunited to the Crown of  France  So that as clear as is the Summer's Sun  King  Pepin  's Title and  Hugh Capet  's Claim  King  Lewis  his Satisfaction all appear  To hold in Right and Title of the Female  So do the Kings of  France  until this Day  Howbeit they would hold up this  Salick  Law  To bar your Highness claiming from the Female  And rather choose to hide them in a Net  Than amply to unbare their crooked Titles  Usurp'd from you and your Progenitors  In  Shakespear  when the Conspiracy of  Scroop Cambridge  and  Grey  is discovered to the King after expostulating with them on their Treachery he gives them up to punishment and dismisses them from his Presence in the very Words of  Holingshed  Touching our Person seek we no Revenge  But we our Kingdom's safety must so tender  Whose ruin you three sought that to her Laws  We do deliver you Go therefore hence  Poor miserable Wretches to your Death  The Taste whereof God of his Mercy give  You Patience to endure and true Repentance  Of all your dear Offences bear them hence  "Revenge herein touching my Person tho' I seek not yet for the Safeguard of my dear Friends and for due Preservation of all Sorts I am by Office to cause Example to be shewed Get ye hence therefore you poor miserable Wretches to the receiving of your just Reward wherein God's Majesty give you Grace of his Mercy and Repentance of your heinous Offences"  Holingshed  In the Play King  Henry  after the taking of  Harfleur  marches his Army which was greatly reduced by Sickness and Fatigue towards  Calais  and is met by a Messenger from the  French  King who in his Master's Name defies him to a Battle  Shakespear  in the latter Part of the Kings Answer again copies the Words of  Holingshed  Go bid thy Master well advise himself  If we may pass we will if we be hinder'd  We shall your tawny Ground with your red Blood  Discolour and so  Mountjoy  fare you well  The Sum of all our Answer is but this  We wou'd not seek a Battle as we are  Yet as we are we say we will not shun it  "I will not seek your Master at this Time but if he or his seek me I will meet with them God willing If any of your Nation attempt once to stop me in my Journey towards  Calais  at their Jeopardy be it and yet wish I not any of you so unadvised as to be the Occasion that I dye your tawny Ground with your red Blood"  Holingshed  Shakespear  throughout this Play has copied many of the Sentiments and even Words of  Holingshed  sometimes almost literally as in the above quoted Passages at others he has just taken Hints which the Force of his own Imagination improves into the most striking Beauties the following Passage of  Holingshed  furnished him with some of the noblest Thoughts that ever animated the Mind of a Heroe  The Historian says Page that a little Time before the Battle of  Agincourt  was fought King  Henry  overheard a Soldier say to his Fellow  I would to God there were with us now so many good Soldiers as are at this Hour within  England  To which the King replied  I would not wish a Man more here than I have we are indeed in Comparison to the Enemies but a few but if God of his Clemency do favour us and our just Cause as I trust he will we shall Speed well enough But let no Man ascribe Victory to our own Strength and Might but only to God's Assistance to whom I have  no doubt we shall worthily have Cause to give thanks therefore and if so be that for our Offences Sakes we shall be delivered into the Hands of our Enemies the less Number we be the less Damage shall the Realm of  England  sustain  Holingshed  This Passage is thus improved by  Shakespear  The Earl of  Westmourland  having been to take a View of the Enemies Forces as they were drawn up in Order of Battle alarmed at the Superiority of their Numbers cries out as the King meets him  Oh that we now had here  But one ten thousand of those Men in  England  That do no Work to Day  K HENRY  What's he that wishes so  My Cousin  Westmourland  No my fair Cousin  If we are marked to dye we are enow  To do our Country loss and if to live  The fewer Men the greater share of Honour  God's Will I pray thee wish not one Man more  By Jove I am not covetous of Gold  Nor care I who doth feed upon my Cost  It yerns me not if Men my Garments wear  Such outward Things dwell not in my Desire  But if it be a Sin to covet Honour  I am the most offending Soul alive  No faith my Lord wish not a Man from  England  God's Peace I would not lose so great an Honour  As one Man more methinks would share from me  For the best Hopes I have Don't wish one more  Rather proclaim it  Westmourland  through my Host  That he which hath no Stomach to this Fight  Let him depart his Passport shall be made  And crowns for convoy put into his Purse  We would not die in that Man's Company  That fears his Fellowship to die with us  In the first Act of this Play the Dauphin of  France  sends an insulting Message to King  Henry  accompanied with a Present of Tennis Balls as a Reproach for the wild Sallies of his Youth  There is no Foundation either in  Hall  or  Holingshed  for this Circumstance  Shakespear  indeed took the outlines of the Dauphin's Character from these Historians who represent him to be a light arrogant and vainglorious Prince but he has painted at full Length what they only drew in Miniture and by adding with great Propriety some of the Characteristic Follies of his Nation given us a lively and humerous Picture of a Coxcomb Prince  The absurdity of making the Princess  Catharine  the only Person in the  French  Court who does not understand  English  has been already taken Notice of And it must be confessed  that the great  Henry  makes but a miserable Figure as a Lover no Language can be coarser than that in which he addresses the Princess the first Time he sees her  Do you like me  Kate  c  Yet the Dialogue is not without wit livliness and humour but so utterly void of Propriety that we lose all Idea of the Dignity of the Persons who manage it and are readier to imagine we hear a common Soldier making love to an aukward Country Girl than a King of  England  courting a Princess of  France  Shakespear  it is probable took the Hint of the  Dauphin  's Present of Tennis Balls from the following old Ballad  A Council grave our King did hold  With many a Lord and Knight  That they might truly understand  That  France  did hold his Right  Unto the King of  France  therefore  Ambassadors were sent  That he might fully understand  His Mind and his Intent  Desiring him in friendly wise  His lawful Right to yield  Or else he vow'd by Dint of Sword  To win the same in Field  The King of  France  with all his Lords  Which heard his Message plain  Unto our brave Ambassadors  Did answer in Disdain  And feigned our King was yet too young  And of too tender Age  Therefore we weigh not of his War  Nor fear we his Courage  His Knowledge is in Feats of Arms  As yet but very small  His tender Joints much fitter were  To toss a Tennis Ball  A Tun of Tennis Balls therefore  In Pride and great Disdain  He sent unto our Noble King  To recompence his Pain  Which Answer when our King did hear  He waxed wroth in Heart  And said he would such  Balls  provide  Should make all  France  to smart  An Army then our King did raise  Which was both good and strong  And from  Southampton  is our King  With all his Navy gone  In  France  he landed safe and sound  With all his warlike Train  And to the Town of  Harfleur  strait  He marched up amain  But when he had besieged the same  Against their fenced Walls  To batter down their stately Towers  He sent his  English  Balls  This done our noble  English  King  March'd up and down the Land  And not a  Frenchman  for his Life  Durst once his Force withstand  Until he came to  Agincourt    Where as it was his Chance  To find the King in Readiness  With all his Power of  France  A mighty Host he had prepar'd  Of armed Soldiers then  Which were no less by just Account  Than Forty Thousand Men  Which Sight did much amaze our King  For he and all his Host  Not passing Fifteen Thousand had  Accounted at the most  The King of  France  which well did know  The Number of our Men  In vaunting Pride unto our Prince  Did send a Herald then  To understand what he would give  For Ransom of his Life  When he in Field should taken be  Amidst their bloody Strife  And then our King with chearful Heart  This Answer soon bid make  And said Before this comes to pass  Some of their Hearts shall quake  And to their proud presumptuous Prince  Declare this Thing quoth he  Mine own Heart's Blood shall pay the Price  None else he gets of me  With that bespoke the Duke of  York    O Noble King quoth he  The Leading of this Battle brave  Vouchsafe to give to me  God a Mercy Cousin  York  quoth he  I grant thee thy Request  Then march thou on courageously  And I will lead the rest  Then came the bragging  Frenchmen  down  With greater Force and Might  With whom our Noble King began  A hard and cruel Fight  The Archers they discharged their Shafts  As thick as Hail from Sky  That many a  Frenchman  in the Field  That happy Day did die  Ten Thousand Men that Day were slain  Of Enemies in the Field  And as many Prisoners  That Day were forced to yield  Thus had our King a happy Day  And Victory over  France    And brought them quickly under Foot  That late in Pride did prance  The Lord preserve our Noble King  And grant to him likewise  The upper Hand and Victory  Of all his Enemies  THE FIRST PART OF King  Henry  the Sixth  THE historical Transactions contained in this Play take in the Compass of about thirty Years they are all extracted from  Holingshed  's Chronicle But  Shakespear  in this as well as in the two following Parts of this King's Reign has not been very exact to the Date and Disposition of the Facts shuffling them backwards and forwards out of the Order of Time in which they happened as it best suited his Purpose The Characters are almost all faithfully copied from the Historian but the Poet has exaggerated the Affection of Queen  Margaret  for the Duke of  Suffolk  representing that Princess as engaged in a criminal Amour with the Duke for which there is no Foundation in History  The Loves of the Queen and Duke of  Suffolk  which make the Subject of several Scenes in the Play not being mentioned either by  Hall  or  Holingshed  'tis probable that  Shakespear  saw some little Novel of the Lives of these two great Persons from whence he copied such Incidents as he thought proper for the Embellishment of his Play but by introducing the Queen in the second Part weeping and lamenting over the Head of her murdered Lover which lyes on her Bosom in the Presence of the King her Husband and several Noblemen he has either very injudiciously copied or very coarsly invented For the absurdity of such a Behaviour must give disgust to the meanest and least intelligent Reader or Spectator  But if  Shakespear  has been misled by Romance or oral Tradition to give such improper Manners to a Queen and in a Historical Play contradict the known Facts on which it is founded he has on the other Hand worked up the simple Relation of the Deaths of a Father and Son in the History into one of the most beautiful and affecting Episodes imaginable  Holingshed  after a circumstantial Detail of all the great Actions of the warlike  Talbot  Earl of  Shrewsbury  proceeds to give an Account of his Death and that of his Son's as they were endeavouring to raise the Siege of  Chastillon  in  France  "The  Frenchmen  says he Page that lay at the Siege perceiving by those good Runners away that the Earle approached left the Siege and retired in good Order into the Place which they had trenched ditched and fortified with Ordnance The Earle advertised how the Siege was removed hasted forward towards his Enemies doubting most lest they would have been quite fled and gone before his comming but they fearing the Displeasure of the  French  King who was not far off if they should have fled abode the Earles comming and so received him who though he first with manfull Courage and sore seighting wan the entrie of their Camp yet at length they compassed him about and shooting him through the Thigh with an HandGun slue his Horse and finallie killed him lying on the Ground whom they never durst look in the Face while he stood on his Feet"  "It was said that after he perceived that there was no Remedy but present loss of the Battel he councelled his Son Lord  Lisle  to save himself by Flight sith the same could not redound to any great Reproach in him this being the first Journey in which he had been present many Words he used to persuade him to have saved his Life but Nature so wrought in the Son that neither desire of Life nor fear of Death could either Cause him to shrinke or convey himself out of the Danger and so there manfully ended his Life with his said Father"  On this Incident the following Scenes are founded in which the Poet has given us the finest Pictures imaginable of true Heroism paternal Tenderness and filial Love  SCENE  a Field of Battle near  Bourdeaux  Enter  TALBOT  and his Son  TALBOT  O young  John Talbot  I did send for thee  To tutor thee in Stratagems of War  That  Talbot  's Name might be in thee reviv'd  When sapless Age and weak unable Limbs  Should bring thy Fathe  to his drooping Chair  But O malignant and illboding Stars  Now art thou come unto a Feast of Death  A terrible and unavoided Danger  Therefore dear Boy mount on my swiftest Horse  And I'll direct thee how thou shall escape  By sudden Flight Come dally not be gone  JOHN  Is my Name  Talbot  Am I your Son  And shall I fly O if you

revenge my Death if I be slain  JOHN  He that flies so will ne'er return again  TALBOT  If we both stay we both are sure to die  JOHN  Then let me stay and Father do you fly  Your Loss is great so your Regard should be  My worth unknown no Loss is known in me  Upon my Death the  French  can little boast  In yours they will in you all Hopes are lost  Flight cannot stain the Honour you have won  But mine it will that no exploit have done  You fled for Vantage every one will swear  But if I bow they'll say it was for fear  There is no Hope that ever I will stay  If the first Hour I shrink and run away  Here on my Knees I beg mortality  Rather than Life preserved with infamy  TALBOT  Shall all thy Mother's Hope lye in one Tomb  JOHN  Ay rather than I'll shame my Mother's Womb  TALBOT  Upon my Blessing I command thee go  JOHN  To fight I will but not to flie the Foe  TALBOT  Part of thy Father may be saved in thee  JOHN  No Part of him but will be shame in me  TALBOT  Thou never hadst Renown nor can'st not lose it  JOHN  Yes your renowned Name shall Flight abuse it  TALBOT  Thy Father's Charge shall clear thee from that Stain  JOHN  You cannot witness for me being slain  If Death be so apparent then both fly  TALBOT  And leave my Followers here to fight and die  My Age was never tainted with such Shame  JOHN  And shall my Youth be guilty of such Blame  No more can I be sever'd from your Side  Than can yourself yourself in twain divide  Stay go do what you will the like do I  For live I will not if my Father die  TALBOT  Then here I take my Leave fair Son  Born to eclipse

him  TALBOT  St George  and Victory fight Soldiers fight  The Regent hath with  Talbot  broke his Word  And left us to the Rage of  France  's Sword  Where is  John Talbot  Pause and take thy Breath  I gave thee Life and rescued thee from Death  JOHN  O twice my Father twice am I thy Son  The Life thou gave'st me first wast lost and done  Till with thy warlike Sword despight of Fate  To my determin'd Time thou gav'st new Date  TALBOT  When from the Dauphin's Crest thy Sword struck Fire  It warm'd thy Father's Heart with proud Desire  Of bold fac'd Victory Then leaden Age  Quicken'd with youthful Spleen and warlike Rage  Beat down  Alanson Orleans Burgundy  And from the Pride of  Gallia  rescu'd thee  The ireful Bastard  Orleans  that drew Blood  From thee my Boy and had the Maidenhood  Of thy first Fight I soon encountred  And interchanging blows I quickly shed  Some of his Bastard Blood and in his Disgrace  Bespoke him thus Contaminated base  And misbegotten Blood I spill of thine  Mean and right poor for that pure Blood of mine  Which thou didst force from  Talbot  my brave Boy  Here purposing the Bastard to destroy  Came in strong Rescue Speak thy Father's Care  Art thou not weary  John  how dost thou fare  Wilt thou yet leave the Battle Boy and fly  Now thou art seal'd the Son of Chivalry  Fly to revenge my Death when I am dead  The Help of one stands me in little Stead  Oh too much folly is it well I wot  To hazard all our Lives in one small Boat  If I die not today with  Frenchmen  's Rage  Tomorrow I shall die with mickle Age  By me they nothing gain and if I stay  'Tis but the shortening of my Life one Day  In thee thy Mother dies our Houshold's Name  My Death's Revenge thy Youth and  England  's Fame  All these and more we hazard by thy Stay  All these are saved if thou wilt fly away  JOHN  The Sword of  Orleans  hath not made me smart  These Words of yours draw Lifeblood from my Heart  Out on that Vantage bought with such a shame  To save a paltry Life and slay bright Fame  Before young  Talbot  from old  Talbot  fly  The coward Horse that bears me fall and die  And like me to the Peasant Boys of  France  To be Shame Scorn and Subject of Mischance  Surely by all the Glory you have won  An if I fly I am not  Talbot  's Son  Then talk no more of Flight it is no Boot  If Son to  Talbot  die at  Talbot  's Foot  Alarm Excursions Enter old  Talbot  led  TALBOT  Where is my other Life mine own is gone  O where is young  Talbot  where is valiant  John  Triumphant Death smear'd with captivity  Young  Talbot  's Valour makes me smile at thee  When he perceived me shrink and on my Knee  His bloody Sword he brandish'd over me  And like a hungry Lion did commence  Rough Deeds of rage and stern Impatience  But when my angry Guardant stood alone  Tendring my ruin and assailed of none  Dizzyey'd Fury and great rage of Heart  Suddenly made him from my side to start  Into the clustering Battle of the  French    And in that Sea of Blood my Boy did drench  His over mounting Spirit and there dy'd  My  Icarus  my Blossom in his Pride  Enter  John Talbot  borne  SERVANT  O my dear Lord lo where your Son is borne  TALBOT  Thou antic Death which laugh'st us here to scorn  Anon from thy insulting Tyranny  Coupled in Bonds of Perpetuity  Two  Talbots  winged through the lither Sky  In thy despight shall 'scape Mortality  O thou whose Wounds become hard favour'd Death  Speak to thy Father ere thou yield thy Breath  Brave Death by speaking whether he will or no  Imagine him a  Frenchman  and thy Foe  Poor Boy he smiles methinks as who should say  "Had Death been  French  then Death had "died today"  Come come and lay him in his Father's Arms  My Spirit can no longer bear these harms  Soldiers adieu I have what I would have  Now my old Arms are young  John Talbot  's Grave  Dies  THE SECOND PART OF King  Henry  the Sixth  THE Contention between the two Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  furnishes the Incidents which compose this Play The Action begins with King  Henry  's Marriage which was in the twenty third Year of his Reign and closes with the first Battle fought at  St Albans  and won by the  York  Faction in the thirty third Year of his Reign so that it takes in the History and Transactions of ten Years  Shakespear  has copied  Holingshed  pretty closely throughout this whole Play except in his Relation of the Duke of  Suffolk  's Death  The Chronicle tells us that King  Henry  to satisfy the Nobility and People who hated this Favourite condemned him to Banishment during the Space of five Years In his Passage to  France  he was taken by a Ship of War belonging to the Duke of  Exeter  Constable of the  Tower  the Captain of which Ship carried him into  Dover  Road and there struck off his Head on the Side of a Cockboat  In  Shakespear  he is taken by  English  Pyrates on the Coast of  Kent  who notwithstanding the large Ransom he offers them resolve to murder him One of them in the Course of his Conversation with the Duke tells him that his Name is  Walter Whitmore  and observing him start asks him if he is frighted at Death to which  Suffolk  replied  Thy Name affrights me in whose Sound is Death  A cunning Man did calculate my Birth  And told me that by  Walter  I should die  This Circumstance is not to be found either in  Hall  or  Holingshed  and as it has greatly the Air of Fiction  Shakespear  probably borrowed it from the same Tale that furnished him with the Loves of  Suffolk  and the Queen on which several passionate Scenes in this Play as well as the former are Built  THE THIRD PART OF King  Henry  the Sixth  THE Scene of this Play opens just after the Battle of  St Albans  wherein the  York  Faction was Victorious and closes with the Murder of King  Henry  the sixth and the Birth of Prince  Edward  afterwards King  Edward  the fifth so that this History takes in the space of sixteen Years The Facts are all extracted from  Holingshed  and most of the Incidents very closely copied The struggle between the two Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  for the Crown being the Subject pursued in this Drama every Scene almost presents us with a new Battle a flying Army or the Carnage of a bloody Field where the inhuman  Conquerors unsated with the Slaughters of the Fight sacrifice their defenceless Enemies to the Fury of their Revenge and exult over them when dying with a Cruelty truly diabolical  Shakespear  has given the same inconsistent and improper Manners to all the chief Persons in this Play the brave old Duke of  York  the gallant  Edward  his Son afterwards King the heroic  Warwick  whom the Poet so often styles the Maker and Subduer of Kings are all Murderers at once the Heroes and the Villains of the Scene equally exciting our Praise and Detestation The Poet in order to display this predominant Passion Cruelty in Characters where it is lest expected to be found the Heroe and the Prince has not scrupled to violate sometimes the Truth of History  The Chronicles say that the Duke of  York  who pretended to the Crown was killed in the Battle of  Wakefield  and being found dead in the Field by the Lord  Clifford  he cut off his Head and presented it to the Queen of  Henry  the sixth who was in Person at this Battle  Shakespear  makes him to be taken Prisoner by the Earls of  Northumberland  and  Clifford  who bring him to the Queen and ask what she would have done to him To which she replies  QUEEN  Brave Warriors  Clifford  and  Northumberland  Come make him stand upon this Molehill here  That raught at Mountains with outstreched Arms  Yet parted but the Shadow with his Hand  What was it you that would be  England  's King  Was't you that revell'd in our Parliament  And made a Preachment of your high Descent  Where are your Mess of Sons to back you now  The wanton  Edward  and the lusty  George  And wher's that valiant crookback'd Prodigy  Dicky  your Boy that with his grumbling Voice  Was wont to cheer his Dad in Mutinies  Or with the rest where is your darling  Rutland  Look  York  I stain'd this Napkin with the Blood  That valiant  Clifford  with his Rapier's Point  Made issue from the Bosom of the Boy  And if thine Eyes can water for his Death  I give thee this to dry thy Cheeks withal  Alas poor  York  but that I hate thee deadly  I should lament thy miserable State  I prythee grieve to make me merry  York  What hath thy fiery Heart so parcht thine Entrails  That not a Tear can fall for  Rutland  's Death  Why art thou patient Man thou shouldst be mad  And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus  Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance  Thou would'st be fee'd I see to make me Sport  York  cannot speak unless he wear a Crown  A Crown for  York  And Lords bow low to him  Hold you his Hands while I do set it on  putting a Paper Crown on his Head  Ay marry Sir now looks he like a King  Ay this is he that took King  Henry  's Chair  And this is he was his adopted Heir  But how is it that great  Plantaganet  Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn Oath  As I bethink me you should not be King  Till our King  Henry  had shook Hands with Death  And will you pale your Head in  Henry  's Glory  And rob his Temples of the Diadem  Now in his Life against your holy Oath  Oh 'tis a Fault too too unpardonable  Off with the Crown and with the Crown his Head  And whilst we breathe take Time to do him dead  With this more than fiendlike Cruelty has  Shakespear  represented a Queen whose Motives for taking Arms were far from being unjust the recovery of her Husband's Liberty and Crown and the restoring her Son to the Rights and Privileges of his Birth And for the Sake of this shocking Absurdity in the Manners of a Female Character in so high a Rank he contradicts a known Fact in History and makes one of the greatest Captains of the Age die by the cowardly Stabs of a Woman and a Ruffian who according to the Chronicles fell in the Field of Battle covered with Wounds and Glory  In the next Act  Clifford  is shewn in the pangs of Death with the great  Warwick  King  Edward  and his Brothers exulting over him and embittering his last Moments with the most unmanly Railings  EDWARD  Bring forth that fatal Screechowl to our House  That nothing sung but Death to us and ours  Now Death shall stop his dismal threatening Sound  And his illboading Tongue no more shall speak  WARWICK  I think his understanding is bereft  Speak  Clifford  dost thou know who speaks to thee  Dark cloudy Death o'ershades his beams of Life  And he nor sees nor hears us what we say  RICHARD  O would he did and so perhaps he doth  'Tis but his Policy to counterfeit  Because he would avoid such bitter Taunts  As in the Time of Death he gave our Father  CLARENCE  If so thou think'st vex him with eager Words  RICHARD  Clifford  ask Mercy and obtain no Grace  EDWARD  Clifford  repent in bootless Penitence  WARWICK  Clifford  devise Excuses for thy Faults  CLARENCE  While we devise fell tortures for thy Faults  RICHARD  Thou did'st love  York  and I am Son to  York  EDWARD  Thou pitied'st  Rutland  I will pity thee  CLARENCE  Where's Captain  Margaret  to fence you now  WARWICK  They mock thee  Clifford  swear as thou wast wont  RICHARD  What not an Oath nay then the World goes hard  When  Clifford  cannot spare his Friends an Oath  I know by that he's dead and by my Soul  If this right Hand would buy but two Hour's Life  That I in all dispight might rail at him  This Hand should chop it off and with the issuing Blood  Stifle the Villain whose unstanched thirst  York  and young  Rutland  could not satisfy  For many of the Murders which the Followers of each Party commit oh those of the other in this Play  Shakespear  had no Foundation in the History but that of the young Earl of  Rutland  by  Clifford  is copied with all its Circumstances from  Holingshed  The Character of King  Henry  the Sixth whose unfortunate Reign makes the Subject of these three Plays is drawn by  Shakespear  exactly conformable to that given him by the Historians As to the Manner of his Death several different Opinions prevailed but the Poet by making the Duke of  Gloucester  murder him in the  Tower  has followed that which was most probable and most generally believed  THE LIFE and DEATH OF King  Richard  the Third  THIS Tragedy tho' it is called the Life and Death of  Richard  the third takes in at most but the last eight Years of his Time The Scene opens with the Imprisonment of  George  Duke of  Clarence  in the  Tower  which happened in the beginning of the Year and closes with the Death of  Richard  at  Bosworth  Field which Battle was fought on the d of  August  in the Year  The historical Facts are all taken from  Holingshed  and the Characters all closely copied from that Author that of  Richard  the third  has been censured as monstrous the Picture of a Fiend and not a Man and too exquisitely wicked to be represented on the Stage 'Tis certain however that  Shakespear  has not aggravated the Vices and Cruelty of this Prince he paints him such as History has transmitted him to us and if his Character shocks us more in the Scene than the Story 'tis because the Colours of the Poet are more lively his Expression stronger and the Lights he shews him in more diversified but the Subject in both is the same The qualities of his Mind and Person are thus summed up by  Holingshed  "As he was small and little of Stature so was he of Body greatly deformed the one Shoulder higher than the other his Face was small but his Countenance cruel and such that the first Aspect a Man would judge it to smell and favour of Malice Fraud and Deceit when he stood musing he would bite and chaw his nether Lip as who said that his fierce Nature always chafed stirred and was ever unquiet beside that the Dagger which he wore he would when he studied with his Hand pluck up and down in the Sheath to the midst never drawing it fullie out He was of a ready pregnant and quick Wit wielie to feire and apt to dissemble He had a proud Mind and an arrogant Stomach the which accompanied him even to his Death rather choosing to suffer the same by dint of Sword than being forsaken and left helpless of his unfaithful Companions to preserve by cowardlie Flight such a frail and uncertain Life which by Malice  Sickness or condigne Punishment was like shortly to come to confusion"  This Character is the very same with that drawn of him by  Shakespear  but the latter is made more striking by the wonderful Propriety of the Manners and Sentiments he every where throughout the Play attributes to him If  Shakespear  is in any Instance to be blamed for keeping too close to the Historian it is for dignifying the last Moments of this bloody Tyrant with such shining Proofs of Fortitude and Valour as notwithstanding the Detestation we conceived at his cruelties must force from us an involuntary Applause The History tells us he fought bravely in that Battle which decided his Fate and overpowered as he was by Numbers disdained to save his Life by Flight  Shakespear  improves this into the following noble Description which has indeed this improper Effect that our hatred of the Tyrant is wholly lost in our Admiration of the Heroe  Alarm Excursions Enter  Catesby  CATESBY  Rescue my Lord of  Norfolk  rescue rescue  The King enacts more wonders than a Man  Daring an Opposite to every Danger  His Horse is slain and all on Foot he fights  Seeking for  Richmond  in the Throat of Death  Alarm Enter King  Richard  K RICHARD  A Horse a Horse my Kingdom for a Horse  CATBSBY  Withdraw my Lord I'll help you to a Horse  K RICHARD  Slave I have set my Life upon a Cast  And I will stand the Hazard of the Dye  There are several of  Shakespears  historical Plays which take in a greater Compass of Time than this but none in which the absurdity of crowding the Events of many Years into a Representation of three Hours is made so glaring This no doubt is occasioned by the very unartful Disposition of the Incidents which though made up of distant Events follow one another without the least Preparation without the Intervention of an Act or Change of Scene to give the Spectator's Imagination room to cheat itself agreeably by supplying that Distance of Time necessary for the giving any Probability to the Story To be convinced of this one need only consider the Conduct of the first Part of the fourth Act where  Richard  for the first Time enters as King his Nephew Prince  Edward  and the Duke of  York  being still alive He declares his Apprehensions of them to the Duke of  Buckingham  by whose Assistance he had usurped the Crown  and presses him to give Consent to their Murder  The Duke demands a Minute's Leisure to consider of his Proposal and goes out  Richard  immediately asks his Page if he can recommend any Person to him that will undertake a Murder for Reward the Page names  Tyrrel  and goes to fetch him King  Richard  then addressing himself to one of his Confidents says  Come hither  Catesby  rumour it abroad  That  Anne  my Wife is sick and like to die  I will take Order for her keeping close  Inquire me out some meanborn Gentleman  Whom I will marry strait to  Clarence'  Daughter  The Boy is foolish and I fear him not  Look how thou dream'stI say again give out  That  Anne  my Wife is sick and like to die  About it for it stands me much upon  To stop all Hopes whose Growth may damage me  I must be married to my Brother's Daughter  Or else my Kingdom stands on brittle Glass  Murder her Brothers and then marry her  Uncertain Way of Gain But I am in  So far in Blood that Sin will pluck on Sin  Tearfalling Pity dwells not in this Eye  This Soliloquy is interrupted by  Tyrrel  whom  Richard  dispatches to the  Tower  with Orders to kill the young Princes imprisoned  there  Buckingham  then reenters and is beginning to acquaint  Richard  with his Resolution concerning the Princes but is stopped by the Tyrant who changes the Discourse  Buckingham  thereupon demands the Earldom of  Hereford  which the King had promised him the King makes evasive Answers till being hard pressed by the Duke he retires and  Buckingham  declaring he will fly to  Brecknock  goes off  Tyrrel  then enters and informs the Audience that the two Princes are murdered by  Dighton  and  Forrest  whom he had suborned to commit this cruel Action the King coming in he tells him his Commands had been performed  Richard  dismisses him with a Promise of Preferment and then proceeds to give the Audience an Account of what he had done during his Absence of two Minutes  King RICHARD  The Son of  Clarence  have I pent up close  His Daughter meanly have I match'd in Marriage  And  Anne  my Wife hath bid this World good Night  Two or three Speeches backwards we find him dispatching  Catesby  to spread a Report  That his Queen  Anne  was Sick and like to die  And also to enquire for some mean Born Gentleman to whom he might marry  Clarence  's Daughter and scarce two Minutes are elapsed till we are informed all this is done  Buckingham  this Moment tells us that he will fly to  Brecknock  to save his Head and scarce has he quitted the Scene when  Catesby  comes in and tells us that  Buckingham  back'd with the hardy  Welshmen  Is in the Field and still his Power increaseth  Absurdities like these are such a gross Abuse of the Understanding that all the Beauties we find scattered throughout this Play can hardly attone for them  THE LIFE OF King  Henry  the Eighth  THIS Play tho' called  The Life of King  Henry  the eighth  takes in only the Transactions of twelve Years of his Reign The Action of it begins with the arresting the Duke of  Buckingham  for high Treason which happened in the thirteenth Year of this King's Reign and closes with the Birth of the Princess  Elizabeth  afterwards Queen of  England  which was on the twentyfifth  The historical Facts upon which this Play is founded are all extracted from  Holingshed  the Characters generally drawn closely after this Historian and many of the Speeches copied almost literally from him  The Accusation Tryal and Death of the Duke of  Buckingham  makes a very affecting Incident in this Play  Shakespear  has been exactly just to historical Truth in making Cardinal  Wolsey  the sole Contriver of this Nobleman's Fall whose Character as it is thus summed up by King  Henry  is perfectly agreeable to that given him by  Holingshed  KING  The Gentleman is learn'd a most rare Speaker  So Nature none more bound his Training such  That he may furnish and instruct great Teachers  And never seek for Aid out of himself  The Accusations the Duke's Surveyor brings against him in the first Act before the King and Council are an Abridgment of all the Articles upon which his Indictment of high Treason was founded as they are set down at length by  Holingshed  King  Henry  in the Play after hearing these Articles consigns him over to the Law in much the same Words with the Historian  Call him to present Tryal if he may  Find Mercy in the Law 'tis his if none  Let him not seek't of us  The King hearing the Accusation enforced to the uttermost by the Cardinal made this  Answer "If the Duke have deserved to be punished let him have according to his Deserts" The Account  Shakespear  gives of his Behaviour at his Tryal agrees exactly with that of  Holingshed  from whom he copies it closely  FIRST GENT  The great Duke  Came to the Bar where to his Accusations  He pleaded still not guilty and alledg'd  Many sharp Reasons to defeat the Law  The King's Attorney on the contrary  Urg'd on Examinations Proofs Confessions  Of divers Witnesses which the Duke desir'd  To have brought  viva voce  to his Face  At which appear'd against him his Surveyor  Sir  Gilbert Pack  his Chancellor and  John Court  Confessor to him with that Devilmonk  Hopkins  that made this mischief  SECOND GENT  That was he  That fed him with his Prophecies  FIRST GENT  The same  All these accused him strongly which he fain  Would have flung from him but indeed he could not  And so his Peers upon this Evidence  Have found him guilty of high Treason Much  He spoke and learnedly for Life but all  Was either pitied in him or forgotten  SECOND GENT  After all this how did he clear himself  FIRST GENT  When he was brought again to the Bar to hear  His Knell rung out his Judgment he was stirr'd  With such an Agony he sweat extreamly  And something spoke in Choler ill and hasty  But he fell to himself again and sweetly  In all the rest shew'd a most noble Patience  Holingshed  Page  "When the Lords had taken their Place the Duke was brought to the Bar and upon his Arraignment pleaded not guilty and put himself upon his Peers Then was his Inditement read which the Duke denied to be true arid as he was an eloquent Man alledged Reasons to falsify the Inditement pleading the Matter for his own Justification very pithily and earnestly The King's Attorney against the Duke's Reasons alledged the Examinations Confessions and Proofs of Witnesses  The Duke desired that the Witnesses might be brought forth And then came before him  Charles Knevet Perk de la Court  and  Hopkins  the Monk of the Priory of the Charterhouse beside  Bath  which like a false Hypocrite had induced the Duke to the Treason with his false  orged Prophesies Divers Presumptions  and Accusations were laid unto him by  Charles Knevet  which he would fain have covered The Depositions were read and the Deponents delivered as Prisoners to the Officers of the  Tower  Then spake the Duke of  Norfolk  and said my Lord the King our Sovereign Lord hath commanded that you shall have his Law ministred with Favour and Right to you wherefore if you have any other Thing to say for yourself you shall be heard Then he was ordered to withdraw him and so was led into  Paradice  a House so named The Lords went to Councel a great While and after took their Places  Then said the Duke of  Norfolk  to the Duke of  Suffolk  what say you of Sir  Edward  Duke of  Buckingham  touching the high Treason The Duke of  Suffolk  answered He is guilty and so said the Marquis and all the other Earls and Lords Thus was this Prince Duke of  Buckingham  found guilty of high Treason by a Duke and a Marquis seven Earls and twelve Barrons The Duke was brought to the Barr sore chafing and sweat marvelously and after he had made his Reverence he paused a While The Duke of  Norfolk  as Judge said Sir  Edward  you have heard how you be indited of high Treason you pleaded thereto not guilty putting yourself to the Peers of the Realm who have found you guilty Then the Duke of  Norfolk  weept and said you shall be led to the King's Prison and there laid on a Hurdle and so drawn to the Place of Execution and there hanged cut down alive your Members cut off  and cast into the Fire your Bowels burnt before you your Head smitten off and your Body quartered and devided at the King's Will and God have mercy on your Soul  The Duke of  Buckingham  said my Lord of  Norfolk  you have said as a Traitor should be said unto but I was never anie But my Lords I nothing malign for that you have done to me but the eternal God forgive you my Death and I do I shall never sue to the King for Life howbeit he is a gracious Prince and more Grace may come from him than I desire I desire you my Lords and all my Fellows to pray for me Then was the Edge of the Ax turned towards him and he led into a Barge Sir  Thomas Lovel  desired him to sit upon the Cushins and Carpet ordained for him He said nay for when I went to  Westminster  I was Duke of  Buckingham  now I am but  Edward Bohune  the most caitife of the World Thus they landed at the  Temple  where Sir  Nicholas Hawse  and Sir  William Sands  received him and led him through the City who desired the People to pray for him of whom some weept and lamented and said this is the End of evil Life God forgive him he was a proud Prince it is Pity he behaved him so against the King and Liege Lord whom God preserve Thus about four of the Clock he was brought as a cast Man to the  Tower  The Friday the th  May  eleven of the Clock this Duke of  Buckingham  Earl of  Hereford Stafford  and  Northampton  with a  great Power was delivered to  John Reim  and  John Skevington  Sheriffes who led him to the Scaffold on  Towerhill  where he said he had offended the King's Grace and desired all Noblemen to beware by him and all Men to pray for him and that he trusted to die the King's true Man  The Substance of what the Duke here says at his Execution  Shakespear  has interwoven into the following Speeches which from the pathetic Eloquence they contain and peculiar Propriety with which they are adopted to the Character and Circumstances of the Speeches derive an inexpressible Grace and Beauty  Enter  Buckingham  from his Arraignment Tipstaves before him the Axe with the Edge towards him Halberts on each side accompanied by Sir  Thomas Lovell  Sir  Nicholas Vaux  Sir  William Sands  and common People  BUCKINGHAM  All good People  You that thus far have come to pity me  Hear what I say and then go home and lose me  I have this Day received a Traitor's Judgment  And by that Name must die yet Heav'n bear Witness  And if I have a Conscience let it sink me  Even as the Axe falls if I be not faithful  To the Law I bear no Malice for my Death  'T has done upon the Premises but Justice  But those that sought it I could wish more Christians  Be what they will I heartily forgive them  Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief  Nor build their evils the Graves of great Men  For then my guiltless Blood must cry against' em  For further Life in this World I ne'er hope  Nor will I sue altho' the King have Mercies  More than I dare make Faults You few that lov'd me  And dare be bold to weep for  Buckingham  His noble Friends and Fellows whom to leave  Is only bitter to him only dying  Go with me like good Angels to my End  And as the long Divorce of Steel falls on me  Make of your Prayers one sweet Sacrifice  And lift my Soul to Heaven Lead on o'God's Name  LOVELL  I do beseech your Grace for Charity  If ever any Malice in your Heart  Were hid against me now forgive me frankly  BUCKINGHAM  Sir  Thomas Lovell  I as free forgive you  As I would be forgiven I forgive all  There cannot be these numberless Offences  'Gainst me I can't take peace with No black Envy  Shall make my GraveCommend me to his Grace  And if he speak of  Buckingham  pray tell him  You met him half in Heaven My Vows and Prayr's  Yet are the King's and till my Soul forsake me  Shall cry for Blessings on him May he live  Longer than I have Time to tell his Years  Ever beloved and loving may his Rule be  And when old Time shall lead him to his End  Goodness and he fill up one Monument  LOVELL  To th' Water side I must conduct your Grace  Then give my Charge to Sir  Nicholas Vaux  Who undertakes you to your End  VAUX  Prepare there  The Duke is coming See the Barge be ready  And fit it with such Furniture as suits  The greatness of his Person  BUCKINGHAM  Nay Sir  Nicholas  Let it alone my State now will but mock me  When I came hither I was Lord high Constable  And Duke of  Backingham  now poor  Edward Bohone  Yet I am richer than my base Accusers  That never knew what Truth meant I now seal it  And with that Blood will make them one Day groan for't  My noble Father  Henry  of  Buckingham  Who first rais'd head against usurping  Richard  Flying for Succour to his Servant  Banister  Being distress'd was by that Wretch betray'd  And without Tryal fell God's Peace be with him  Henry  the Sev'nth succeeding truly pitying  My Father's Loss like a most royal Prince  Restor'd to me my Honours and from Ruins  Made my Name once more noble Now his Son  Henry  the Eighth Life Honour Name and all  That made me happy at one Stroke has taken  For ever from the World I had my Tryal  And must needs say a noble one which makes me  A little happier than my wretched Father  Yet thus far we are one in Fortune both  Fell by our Servants by those Men we lov'd  A most unnatural and faithless Service  Heav'n has an End in all Yet you that hear me  This from a dying Man receive as certain  Where you are lib'ral of your Loves and Counsels  Be sure you be not loose those you make Friends  And give your Hearts to when they once perceive  The least Rub in your Fortunes fall away  Like Water from ye never found again  But where they mean to sink ye All good People  Pray for me I must leave ye the last Hour  Of my long weary Life is come upon me  Farewell and when you would say something sad  Speak how I fellI've done and God forgive me  The Divorce of Queen  Catharine  from King  Henry  the Eighth makes one of the principal Incidents of this Play  Shakespear  has here so closely copied  Holingshed  as well in the Facts as the Speeches of the chief Persons concerned in this Affair that it will be necessary to transcribe the Passages both from the Historian and Poet if we would judge of their Similarity  Holingshed  Page  "Ye have heard how the People talked a little before the Cardinal's going over into  France  the last Year that the King was told by Dr  Longland  Bishop of  Lincoln  and others that his Marriage with Queen  Kathrine  could not be good nor lawful The Truth is that whether this Doubt was first moved by the Cardinal or by the said  Longland  being the King's Confessor the King was not only brought in Doubts whether it was a lawful Marriage or no but also determined to have the Case examined cleered and adjudged by Learning Law and sufficient Authority The Cardinal verily was put in most Blame for this Scruple now cast into the King's Conscience for the Hate he bore to the Emperor because he would not grant to him the Archbishoprick of  Toledo  for the which he was a Suiter and therefore he did not only procure the King of  England  to join in Friendship with the  French  King but also sought a Divorce betwixt the King and Queen that the  King might have in Marriage the Dutchess of  Alanson  Sister to the  French  King and as some have thought he travelled in that Matter with the  French  King at  Amiens  But the Dutchess would not give Ear thereunto  But howsoever it came about that the King was thus troubled in Conscience concerning his Marriage this followed that like a wise and sage Prince to have the Doubt clearly removed he called together the best learned of the Realm which were of several Opinions Wherefore he thought to know the Truth by indifferent Judges lest peradventure the  Spaniards  and other also in favour of the Queen would say that his own Subjects were not indifferent Judges in this Behalf and therefore he wrote his Cause to  Rome  and likewise sent to all the Universities in  Italy  and  France  and to the great Clerks of all Christendome to know their Opinions and desired the Court of  Rome  to send into his Realm a Legate which should be indifferent and of great and profound Judgment to hear the Cause debated At whose Request the whole Consistory of the College of  Rome  sent thither  Laurence Campeius  a Priest Cardinal a Man of great Wit and Experience which was sent hither before in the tenth Year of this King and with him was joined in Commission the Cardinal of  York  and Legate of  England  This Cardinal came to  London  in  October  and did intimate both to the King and Queen the Cause of his coming which being known  great Talk was had thereof The Archbishop of  Canterbury  sent for the famous Doctors of both the Universities to  Lambeth  and there were every Day Disputations and Communings of this Matter And because the King meant nothing but uprightly therein and knew that the Queen was something wedded to her own Opinion and wished that she should do nothing without Counsel he bad her choose the best Clerks of his Realme to be of her Councel and licenced them to do the best on her Part that they could according to the Truth Then she elected  William Warham  Archbishop of  Canterbury  and  Nicholas West  Bishop of  Elie  Doctors of the Laws and  John Fisher  Bishop of  Rochester  and  Henry Standish  Bishop of St  Asaph  Doctors of Divinity and many other Doctors and welllearned Men which for Surety like Men of great Learning defended her Cause as far as Learning might maintain and hold it up  About this time was received into Favour  Stephen Gardiner  whose Service he used in Matters of great Secrecy and Weight admitting him in the room of Dr  Pace  the which being continually abroad in Ambassages and the same oftentimes not much necessary by the Cardinal's Appointment at length he took such Grief therewith that he fell out of his right Wits  The Place where the Cardinals should sit to hear the Cause of Matrimony betwixt the King and Queen was at the  Black Friars  in  London    where in the great Hall was Preparation made of Seats Tables and other Furniture according to such a solemn Session and royal Appearance The Court was platted in Tables and Benches in manner of a Consistory one Seat raised higher for the Judges to sit in then as it were in the midst of the said Judges aloft above them three Degrees high was a Cloth of State hanged with a Chair royal under the same wherein sat the King and beside him some Distance from him sat the Queen and under the Judges Feet sat the Scribes and other Officers the chief Scribe was Dr  Stevens  and the Caller of the Court was one  Cooke  of  Winchester  Then before the King and Judges within the Court sat the Archbishop of  Canterbury Warham  and all the other Bishops Then stood at both Ends within the Councellors learned in the spiritual Laws as well the King's as the Queen's The Doctors of Law for the King had their convenient Rooms Thus was the Court furnished The Judges commanded Silence whilst their Commission was read both to the Court and to the People assembled that done the Scribes commanded the Crier to call the King by the Name of  King  Henry  of  England  come into the Court  c with that the King answered and said  Here  Then called he the Queen by the Name of Kathrine  Queen of  England  come into the Court  c who made no Answer but rose out of her Chair  And because she could not come directly to the King for the Distance severed between them she went about by the Court and came to the King kneeling down at his Feet to whom she said in effect as followeth Sir I desire you to do me Justice and Right and take some Pity on me for I am a poor Woman and Stranger born out of your Dominions having here no indifferent Counccl and less Assurance of Friendship Alas Sir what have I offended you or what Occasion of Displeasure have I shewed you intending thus to put me from you after this Sort I take God to my Judge I have been to you a true and humble Wife ever conformable to your Will and Pleasure that never contraried or gainsaid any thing thereof and being always contented with all things wherein you had any Delight whether little or much without Grudge or Displeasure I loved for your sake all them whom you loved whether they were my Friends or Enemies I have been your Wife these twenty Years and more and you have had by me diverse Children if there be any just Cause that you can allege against me either of Dishonesty or Matter lawful to put me from you I am content to depart to my Shame and Rebuke and if there be none then I pray you to let me have Justice at your Hand The King your Father was in his time of excellent Wit and the King of  Spain Ferdinand  my Father was reckoned one of the wisest Princes that raigned in  Spain  many Years before it is not  to be doubted but that they had gathered as wise Councellors unto them of every Realme as to their Wisdom they thought meet who deemed the Marriage between you and me good and lawful Wherefore I humbly desire you to spare me untill I may know what Councell my Friends in  Spain  will advertise me to take and if you will not then your Pleasure be fulfilled With that she rose up making a low Curtesie to the King and departed from thence  The King being advertised that she was ready to go out of the House commanded the Crier to call her again who called her by these Words Cathrine  Queen of England come into the Court  with that quoth Mr  Griffith  Madam you be called again On on quoth she it maketh no Matter I will not tarry go on your wayes and thus she departed without any farther Answer at that Time or any other and never would appear after in any Court The King perceiving she was departed said these Words in Effect For as much quoth he as the Queen is gone I will in her Absence declare to you all that she hath been to me as true as obedient and as conformable a Wife as I could Wish or Desire She hath all the virtuous Qualities that ought to be in a Woman of her Dignity or in any other of a baser Estate she is also surely a noble Woman born her Conditions will well declare the same  With that quoth  Wolsey  the Cardinal Sir I most humbly require your Highness to declare before all this Audience whether I have been the chief and first Mover of this Matter unto your Majesty or no for I am greatly suspected herein My Lord Cardinal quoth the King I can well excuse you in this Matter Marrie quoth he you have rather been against me in the tempting hereof than a Setter forward or Mover of the same The special Cause that moved me unto this Matter was a certain Scrupulosity that pricked my Conscience upon ceriain Words spoken at a Time when it was by the Bishop of  Baion  the  French  Ambassador who had been hither sent upon the debating of a Marriage between our Daughter the Lady  Mary  and the Duke of  Orleance  second Son to the King of  France  Upon the Resolution and Determination whereof he desired Respite to advertise the King his Master thereof whether our Daughter  Mary  should legitimate in Respect of this my Marriage with this Woman being sometime my Brother's Wife which Words once conceived within the secret Bottom of my Conscience ingendered such a scrupulous Doubt that my Conscience was incontinently accombred vexed disquieted whereby I thought myself to be greatly in Danger of God's Indignation which appeared to be as to me seemed the rather for that he fent us no issue Male and all such Issues Male as my said Wife had by me died incontinent after they came into the World so I doubted the great Displeasure of God in  that behalf Thus my Conscience being tossed in the Waves of a scrupulous Mind and partly Despair to have any other Issue than I had already by this Lady now my Wife it behoved me further to consider the State of this Realm and the Danger it stood in for lack of a Prince to succeed me I thought it good in Release of the weighty Burthen of my weak Conscience and also the quiet Estate of this worthy Realm to attempt the Law therein whether I may lawfully take another Wife by whom God may send me more Issue in case this my first Copulation was not good without any carnal Concupiscence and not for any Displeasure or misliking of the Queen's Person and Age with whom I would be as well contented to continue if our Marriage may stand with the Laws of God as with any alive In this Point confisteth all this Doubt that we go about now to trie by the Learning Wisdom and Judgment of you our Prelates and Pastors of all this our Realm and Dominions now here assembled for that Purpose to whose Conscience and Learning I have committed the Charge and Judgment according to the which I will God willing be right well content to submit myself and for my Part obey the same Wherein after that I perceived my Conscience so doubtfull I moved it in Confession to you my Lord of  Lincoln  then Ghostly Father and for so much as then you yourself were in some Doubt you moved me to ask the Councel of all these my Lords whereupon I moved you my Lord of  Canterbury  first to have your Licence in as much as you were Metropolitan  to put this Matter in Question and so I did of all you my Lords to which you granted under your Seals here to be shewed That is truth quoth the Archbishop of  Canterbury  After that the King rose up and the Court was adjourned untill another Day  Here is to be noted that the Queen in Presence of the whole Court most greveously accused the Cardinal of Untruth Deceit Wickedness and Malice which had sowne Discention betwixt her and the King her Husband and therefore openly protested that she did utterly abhore refuse and forsake such a Judge as was not only a most malicious Enemy to her but also a manifest Adversarie to all Right and Justice and therewith did she appeal unto the  Pope  committing her whole Cause to be judged by him But notwithstanding this Appeal the Legates sat weekly and every Day were Argument on both Parts and Proofes alleged for the understanding of the Case and still they stayed if they could by any Means to procure the Queen to call back her Appeal which she utterly refused to do The King would gladly have had an end in this Matter but when the Legates drave Time and determined upon no certain Point he conceived a suspicion that this was done of Purpose that their doings might draw to none Effect or Conclusion"  SCENE  Black Fryars  c  WOLSEY  Whilst our Commission from  Rome  is

Holiness  And to be judg'd by him  She curtisies to the King and offers to depart  CAMPEIUS  The Queen is obstinate  Stubborn to Justice apt t'accuse it and  Disdainful to be try'd by't 'tis not well  She's going away  KING  Call her again  CRIER  Cathrine  Queen of  England  come into the Court  USHER  Madam you are call'd back  QUEEN  What need you note it pray you keep your Way  When you are call'd return Now the Lord help  They vex me past my Patience Pray you pass on  I will not tarry no nor ever more  Upon this Business my Appearance make  In any of their Courts  Exeunt  Queen  and her Attendants  KING  Go thy ways  Kate    That Man i'th'World who shall report he has  A better Wife let him in nought be trusted  For speaking false in that Thou art alone  If thy rare Qualities sweet Gentleness  Thy Meekness Saintlike Wifelike Government  Obeying in commanding and thy Parts  Sovereign and pious else could speak thee out  The Queen of earthly Queens she's nobly born  And like her true Nobility she has  Carried herself towards me  WOLSEY  Most gracious Sir  In humblest Manner I require your Highness  That it shall please you to declare in hearing  Of all these Ears for where I'm robb'd and bound  There must I be unloos'd altho' not there  At once and fully satisfied if I  Did broach this Business to your Highness or  Laid any Scruple in your Way which might  Induce you to the Question on't or ever  Have to you but with Thanks to God for such  A Royal Lady speak one the least Word  That might be Prejudice of her present State  Or Touch of her good Person  KING  My Lord Cardinal  I do excuse you yea upon mine Honour  I free you from't You are not to be taught  That you have many Enemies that know not  Why they are so but like the Village Curs  Bark when their Fellows do By some of these  The Queen is put in Anger y'are excus'd  But will you be more justified You ever  Have wish'd the sleeping of this Business never  Desir'd it to be stirr'd but oft have hindred  The Passages made tow'rds itOn my Honour  I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this Point  And thus far clear him Now what mov'd me to't  I will be bold with Time and your Attention  Then mark th'Inducement Thus it came give heed to't  My Conscience first receiv'd a Tenderness  Scruple and Prick on certain Speeches utter'd  By the Bishop of  Bayon  then  French  Ambassador  Who had been hither sent on the debating  A Marriage 'twixt the Duke of  Orleans  and  Our Daughter  Mary  I' th' Progress of this Business  Ere a determinate Resolution he  I mean the Bishop did require a Respite  Wherein he might the King his Lord advertise  Whether our Daughter were legitimate  Respecting this our Marriage with the Dowager  Some time our Brother's Wife This Respite shook  The Bottom of my Conscience enter'd me  Yea with a splitting Power and made to tremble  The Region of my Breast which forc'd such way  That many maz'd Considerings did throng  And press'd in with this Caution First methought  I stood not in the Smile of Heav'n which had  Commanded Nature that my Lady's Womb  If it conceiv'd a Male Child by me should  Do no more Offices of Life to't than  The Grave does to the Dead for her Male Issue  Or died where they were made or shortly after  This World had air'd them Hence I took a Thought  This was a Judgment on me that my Kingdom  Well worthy the best Heir o'th'World should not  Be gladded in't by me Then follows that  I weigh'd the Danger which my Realms stood in  By this my Issue's Fail and that gave to me  Many a groaning Throe Thus hulling in  The wild Sea of my Conscience I did steer  Towards this Remedy whereupon we are  Now present here together that's to say  I mean to rectify my Conscience which  I then did feel full sick and yet not well  By all the rev'rend Fathers of the Land  And Doctors learn'd First I began in private  With you my Lord of  Lincoln  you remember  How under my Oppression I did reek  When I first mov'd you  LINCOLN  Very well my Liege  KING  I have spoke long be pleas'd yourself to say  How far you satisfied me  LINCOLN  Please your Highness  The Question did at first so stagger me  Bearing a Stake of mighty Moment in't  And Consequence of Dread that I committed  The daring'st Counsel which I had to doubt  And did intreat your Highness to this Course  Which you are running here  KING  I then mov'd you  My Lord of  Canterbury  and got your Leave  To make this present Summons Unsollicited  I left no rev'rend Person in this Court  But by particular Consent proceeded  Under your Hands and Seals Therefore go on  For no Dislike i' th' World against the Person  Of our good Queen but the sharp thorny Points  Of my alledged Reasons drive this forward  Prove but our Marriage lawful by my Life  And kingly Dignity we are contented  To wear our mortal State to come with her  Cath'rine  our Queen before the primest Creature  That's paragon'd i'th'World  CAMPEIUS  So please your Highness  The Queen being absent 'tis a needful Fitness  That we adjourn this Court to further Day  Mean while must be an earnest Motion  Made to the Queen to call back her Appeal  She intends to his Holiness  KING  I may perceive  These Cardinals trifle with me I abhor  This dilatory Sloth and Tricks of  Rome  My learn'd and wellbeloved Servant  Cranmer  Pr'ythee return with thy Approach I know  My Comfort comes along Break up the Court  I say set on  Exeunt  The Visit which the Popes Legate Cardinal  Campeius  and Cardinal  Wolsey  make to the Queen her Reception of them and the Discourse that past amongst them is not less closely copied  Page  "The next Court Day the Cardinals sat again at which Time the Councel on both sides were there ready to answer The King's Councel alledged the Matrimony not to be lawful at the Beginning because of the carnal Copulation had between Prince  Arthur  and the Queen This Matter was very vehemently touched on that Side and to prove it they alledged many Reasons and Similitudes of Truth and being answered negatively again on the other Side it seemed that all their former Allegations were doubtful to be tried and that no Man knew the Truth and thus this Court passed from Sessions to Sessions and Day to Day till at certain of their Sessions the King sent the two Cardinals to the Queen who was then in  Bridwell  to persuade with her by their Wisdoms and to advise her to surrender the whole Matter into the King's Hands by her own Consent and Will which should be much better to her Honour than to stand to the Tryal of Law and thereby to be condemned which should seem much to her Dishonour  The Cardinal being in the Queen's Chamber of Presence the Gentleman Usher advertised the Queen that the Cardinals were come to speak with her with that she rose up and with a Skeine of white Thread about her Neck came into her Chamber of Presence where the Cardinals were attending At whose coming quoth she what is your Pleasure with me If it please your Grace quoth Cardinal  Wolsey  to go into your Privy Chamber we will shew the Cause of our coming My Lord quoth she if ye have any Thing to say speak it openly before all these Folk for I fear nothing you can say against me but that I would have all the World should hear and see it and therefore speak your Mind Then began the Cardinal to speak to her in  Latine  Nay good my Lord quoth she speak to me in  English  Forsooth quoth the Cardinal good Madam if it please you we come both to know your Mind how you are disposed to do in this Matter between the King and you and also to declare secretely our Opinions and Councels unto you which we do only for very Zeal and Obedience we bear unto your Grace My Lord quoth she I thank you for your good Will but to make you Answer in your Request I cannot so suddenly for I was set among my Maids at Work thinking full little of any such Matter wherein there needeth a longer Deliberation and a better Head than mine to make Answer for I need Councell in this Call which touches me so near and for any Councell  or Friendship that I can find in  England  they are not for my Profit what think you my Lords will any  Englishman  Councell me or be Friend to me against the King's Pleasure that is his Subject Nay forsooth and as for Councell in whom I will put my trust they be not here they be in  Spain  in my own Country And my Lords I am a poor Woman lacking Wit to answer to any such Noble Persons of Wisdom as you be in so weighty a Matter therefore I pray you be good to me poor Woman destitute of Friends here in a foreign Region and your Councell also I will be glad to hear And therewith she took the Cardinal by the Hand and led him into her privy Chamber with the other Cardinal where they tarried a Season talking with the Queen which Communication ended they departed to the King making to him Relation of her Talk Thus this Case went forward from Court to Court till it came to Judgment so that every one expected that Judgment would be given the next Day At which Day the King came thither and set him down in a Chair within a Door in the End of the Gallery which opened directly against the Judgment Seat to hear the Judgment given at which Time all their Proceedings were read in  Latine  That done the King's Councell at the Bar called for Judgment with that quoth Cardinal  Campeius  I will not give Judgment till I have made Relation to the Pope of all our Proceedings whose Councell and Commandment in  this Case I will observe The Case is very doubtful and also the Party Defendant will make no Answer here but doth rather Appeal from us supposing that we be not indifferent wherefore I will adjourn this Court for this Time according to the Order of the Court of  Rome  And with that the Court was dissolved and no more done This potracting of the Conclusion of the Matter King  Henry  took very displeasantly Then Cardinal  Campeius  took his Leave of the King and Nobility and returned to  Rome"  ACT III  SCENE  the

Mistress' sake  Believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal  The willing'st Sin I ever yet committed  May be absolv'd in  English  WOLSEY  Noble Lady  I'm sorry my Integrity should breed  And

You have too much good Lady But to know  How you stand minded in the weighty Difference  Between the King and you and to deliver  Like free and honest Men our just Opinions  And comforts to your Cause  CAMPEIUS  Most honour'd Madam  My Lord of  York  out of his noble Nature  Zeal and Obedience he still bore your Grace  Forgetting like a good Man your late Censure  Both of his Truth and him which

to make you suddenly an Answer  In such a Point of Weight so near mine Honour  More near my Life I fear with my weak Wit  And to such Men of Gravity and Learning  In Truth I know not I was set at work  Among my Maids full little God knows looking  Either for such Men or such Business  For her Sake that I have been for I feel  The last Fit of my Greatness good your Graces  Let me have Time and Council for my Cause  Alas I am a Woman friendless hopeless  WOLSEY  Madam you wrong the King's Love with those Fears  Your Hopes and Friends are infinite  QUEEN  In  England  But little for my Profit

Friends  They that must weigh out my Afflictions  They that my Trust must grow to live not here  They are as all my Comforts are far hence  In my own Country Lords  CAMPEIUS  I would your Grace  Would leave your Griefs and take my Counsel  QUEEN  How Sir  CAMPEIUS  Put your main Cause into the King's Protection  He's loving and most gracious 'Twill be much  Both for your Honour better and your Cause  For if the Tryal of the Law o'ertake you  You'll part away disgrac'd  WOLSEY  He tells you rightly  QUEEN  Ye tell me what ye wish for both my Ruin  Is this your Christian Counsel Out upon ye  Heav'n is above all yet there sits a Judge  That no King can corrupt  CAMPEIUS  Your Rage mistakes us  QUEEN  The more shame for ye holy Men I thought ye  Upon my Soul two rev'rend Cardinal Vertues

Fondness superstitious to him  Almost forgot my Prayers to content him  And am I thus rewarded 'tis not well Lords  Bring me a constant Woman to her Husband  One that ne'er dream'd a Joy beyond his Pleasure  And to that Woman when she has done most  Yet will I add an Honour a great Patience  WOLSEY  Madam you wander from the good we aim at  QUEEN  My Lord I dare not make myself so guilty  To give up willingly that noble Title  Your Master wed me to nothing but Death  Shall e'er divorse my Dignities  WOLSEY  Pray hear me  QUEEN  Would I had never trod this  English  Earth  Or felt the Flatteries that grow upon it  Ye've Angels' Faces but Heav'n knows your Hearts  What shall become of me now wretched Lady  I am the most unhappy Woman living  Alas poor Wenches where are now your Fortunes  To her Women  Shipwreck'd upon a Kingdom where no Pity  No Friends no Hope no Kindred weep for me  Almost no Grave allow'd me Like the Lilly  That once was Mistress of the Field and flourish'd  I'll hang my Head and perish  WOLSEY  If your Grace  Could not be brought to know our Ends are honest  You'd feel more comfort why should we good Lady  Upon what Cause wrong you▪ alas our Places  The Way of our Profession is against it  We are to ear such Sorrows not to sow 'em  For Goodness' sake consider what you do  How you may hurt yourself nay utterly  Grow from the King's

as even as a Calm pray think us  Those we profess Peace make us Friends and Servants  CAMPEIUS  Madam you'll find it so you wrong your Virtues  With these weak Women's Fears A noble Spirit  As yours was put into you ever casts  Such Doubts as false Coin from it the King loves you  Beware you lose it not for us if you please  To trust us in your Business we are ready  To use our utmost Studies in your Service  QUEEN  Do what you will my Lords and pray forgive me  If I have us'd myself unmannerly  You know I am a Woman lacking Wit  To make a seemly Answer to such Persons  Pray do my Service to

She should have bought her Dignities so dear  Shakespear  makes the King first see  Anna Bullen  at a Banquet given by Cardinal  Wolsey  There seems to be some little Absurdity in this Incident for  Anna Bullen  being as the Lord Chamberlain afterwards tells the King one of the Queen's Attendants it can hardly be supposed that he never saw her before This Banquet is at large described by  Holingshed Shakespear  follows him closely in several of the Circumstances as well as the Discourse that passed between the King and some of the Persons present  "On a time says  Holingshed  Page the King came suddenly thither in a Mask with a Dozen Maskers all in Garments like Shepherds made of fine Cloth of Gold and Crimson Sattin paned and Caps of the same with Vizards of good Physnomie their Hair and Beards either of fine Goldwire Silk or Black Silk having sixteen Torchbearers besides their Drums and other Persons with their Vizards all cloathed in Sattin of the same Colour and before his entering into the Hall he came by Water to the Watergate without Noise where were laid diverse Chambers and Guns charged with Shot and at his Landing they were shot off which made such a Rumble in the Air that it was like Thunder it made all the Noblemen Ladies and Gentlemen to muse what it should mean coming so suddenly they sitting quiet at a solemn Banquet after  this Sort First you shall understand that the Tables were set in the Chamber of Presence just covered and the Lord Cardinal sitting under a Cloth of State there having all his Service alone and was there set a Lady with a Nobleman or a Gentleman and a Gentlewoman throughout all the Tables in the Chamber on the one Side which were made and joined as it were but one Table all which order and devise was done by the Lord  Sanders  then Lord Chamberlain to the King and by Sir  Henry Guildford  Comptroller of the King's House Then immediately after the Great Chamberlain and the said Comptroller sent to look what it should mean as though they knew nothing of the Matter who looking out of the Windows into the  Thames  returned again and shewed him that it seemed they were Noblemen and Strangers that arrived at his Bridge coming as Ambassadors from some foreign Prince With that quoth the Cardinal I desire you because you can speak  French  to take the Pains to go into the Hall there to receive them according to their Estates and to conduct them into this Chamber where they shall see us and all these noble Personages being merry at our Banquet desiring them to sit down with us and to take part of our Fare Then went down incontinently into the Hall where they were received with twenty new Torches and conveyed them up into the Chamber with such a noise of Drums and Flutes as seldom had been heard the like At their entring into the Chamber two and two together they went directly towards the Cardinal  where he sat and saluted him reverently To whom the Lord Chamberlain for them said Sir for as much as they be Strangers and can not speak  English  they have desired me to declare unto you that having understanding of this triumphant Banquet where was assembled such a Number of excellent Dames they could do no less under support of your Grace but to repair hither to view as well their incomparable Beauty as for to accompany them at Mumchance and then to Dance with them and Sir they require of your Grace Licence to accomplish the said Cause of their coming To whom the Cardinal said he was very well content they should do so Then went the Maskers and first saluted all the Dames and returned to the most worthy and there opened their great Cup of Gold filled with Crowns and other Pieces of Gold to whom they set certain Pieces of Gold to cast at Thus perusing all the Ladies and Gentlewomen to some they lost and of some they won and marking after this Manner all the Ladies they returned to the Cardinal with great Reverence powring down all the Gold so left in their Cup which was about two Hundred Crowns At all quoth the Cardinal and so cast the Dice and wone them whereat was made a great Noise and Joy Then quoth the Cardinal to the Lord Chamberlain I pray you that you would shew them that me seemeth there should be a Nobleman amongst them who is more meet to occupy this Seat and Place than I am to  whom I would most gladly surrender the same according to my Duty if I knew him  Then spake the Lord Chamberlain to them in  French  and they rounding him in the Ear the Chamberlain said unto my Lord Cardinal Sir quoth he they confess that among them there is such a noble Personage whom if your Grace can point him out from the rest he is content to disclose himself and accept your Place With that the Cardinal taking good Advisement among them at the last quoth he me seemeth the Gentleman with the black Beard should be he and with that rose out of his Chair and offered the same to the Gentleman in the black Beard with his Cap in his Hand The Person to whom he offered the Chair was Sir  Edward Nevill  a comely Knight that much more resembled the King's Person in that Mask than any other The King perceiving the Cardinal so deceived could not forbear laughing but pulling down his Visar and Mr  Nevill  's also and dashed out such a pleasant Countenance and Cheere that all the noble Estates there assembled perceiving the King to be there among them rejoiced very much"  SCENE York House  Hautboys A small Table under a State for the Cardinal a long Table for the Guests Then enter  Anne Bullen  and divers other Ladies and Gentlewomen as Guests at one Door

Sir  Thomas Lovell  is the Banquet ready  I'th' Privy Chamber  LOVELL  Yes my Lord  WOLSEY  Your Grace  I fear with Dancing is a little heated  KING  I fear too much  WOLSEY  There's fresher Air my Lord  In the next Chamber  KING  Lead in your Ladies every one Sweet Partner  I must not yet forsake you let's be merry  Good my Lord Cardinal I have half a dozen Healths  To drink to these fair Ladies and a Measure  To lead them once again and then let's dream  Who's best in Favour let the Music knock it  This Play as the learned Mr  Upton  observes in his critical Observations on  Shakespear  might be properly called the Fall of Cardinal  Wolsey  if the Action had closed with the Marriage of the King to  Anna Bullen  This haughty Churchman is indeed shewn in the Heighth of his Power and Favour with the King from whence he falls by a Concurrence of unhappy Circumstances which bring on his total Disgrace and at last his Death But even in this Case the Action could not be considered as one and entire while Queen  Catharine  's Sufferings make so large a Part of it and which from the Dignity of her Character and the great and sudden Reverse of her Fortune cannot with any Propriety form only a subordinate Incident in a Play whose Subject is the Fall of a much less considerable Person than herself  Queen  Catharine  has a higher Claim to give a Title to the Tragedy than  Wolsey  since her Quality and Misfortunes are both superior to his She like him is shewn in the Sunshine  of her Fortune a Queen and happy in the Affections of her Sovereign and Husbund as may be concluded from King  Henry  's Speech to her at her Entrance into the CouncilChamber  KING  Arise and take your Place by us half your Suit  Never name to us you have half our Power  The other Moity ere you ask is given  Repeat your Will and take it  After this we see her despised neglected banished from his Bed the Name and Character of Wife taken from her divorced unqueen'd and shutting up all her Sorrows in Death The Fate of this Queen or that of Cardinal  Wolsey  each singly afforded a Subject for Tragedy  Shakespear  by blending them in the same Piece has destroyed the Unity of his Fable divided our Attention between them and by adding many other inconnected Incidents all foreign to his Design has given us an irregular historical Drama instead of a finished Tragedy  In all that related to Cardinal  Wolsey  he has exactly followed historical Truth and his Character as drawn by the Queen and  Griffith  with all its Lights and Shades is as the Reader may perceive closely copied from that Historian  Queen  Catharine  in the Play being told by  Griffith  her Gentleman Usher that the Cardinal is dead replies  So may he rest his Faults lie gently on him  Yet thus far  Griffith  give me leave to speak him  And yet with Charity he was a Man  Of an unbounded Stomach ever ranking  Himself with Princes One that by Suggestion  Ty'd all the Kingdom Simony was fair Play  His own Opinion was his Law I'th'Presence  He would say Untruths and be ever double  Both in his Words and Meaning He was never  But where he meant to ruin pitiful  His Promises were as he then was mighty  But his Performance as he now is nothing  Of his own Body he was ill and gave  The Clergy ill Example  "This Cardinal was of a great Stomach for he counted himself equal with Princes and by crafty Suggestion got into his Hands innumerable Treasure he forced little on Simony and was not pitiful  and stood affectionate in his own Opinion In open Presence he would lie and say Untruths and was double both in Speech and Meaning he would promise much and perform little he was vicious of his Body and gave the Clergy evil Example"  GRIFFITH  Noble Madam  Men's evil Manners live in Brass their Virtues  We write in Water May it please your Highness  To hear me speak his Good now  CATHARINE  Yes good  Griffith  I were malicious else  GRIFFITH  This Cardinal  Though from an humble Stock undoubtedly  Was fashion'd to much Honour from his Cradle  He was a Scholar and a ripe and good One  Exceeding wife fair spoken and persuading  Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not  But to those Men that sought him sweet as Summer  And though he were unsatisfy'd in getting  Which was a sin yet in bestowing Madam  He was most princely Ever witness for him  Those Twins of Learning that he rais'd in you  Ipswich  and  Oxford  one of which fell with him  Unwilling to outlive the Good he did it  The other though unfinish'd yet so famous  So excellent in Art and still so rising  That Christendom shall ever speak his Virtue  His Overthrow heap'd Happiness upon him  For then and not till then he felt himself  And found the Blessedness of being little  And to add greater Honours to

Pomp of his Life"  Tho' the Character of King  Henry  is drawn after this Historian yet  Shakespear  has placed it in the most advantagious Light In this Play he represents him as greatly displeased with the Grievances of his Subjects and ordering them to be relieved tender and obliging to his Queen grateful to the Cardinal and in the Case of  Cranmer  capable of distinguishing and rewarding true Merit If in the latter Part of the Play he endeavours to cast the disagreeable Parts of this Prince's Character as much into Shade as possible it is not to be  wondered at  Shakespear  wrote in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  a Princess who inherited more of the Ambition of her Father  Henry  than of the Tenderness and Delicacy of her Mother  Anne Bullen  And however sensible she might be of the Injuries her Mother endur'd would not have suffered her Father's Character to have been drawn in the worst Colours either by an Historian or a Poet  Shakespear  has exerted an equal degree of Complaisance towards Queen  Elizabeth  by the amiable Lights he shews her Mother in in this Play  Anne Bullen  is represented as affected with the most tender Concern for the Sufferings of her Mistress Queen  Catharine  receiving the Honour the King confers on her by making her Marchioness of  Pembroke  with a graceful Humility and more anxious to conceal her Advancement from the Queen lest it should aggravate her Sorrows than solicitous to penetrate into the Meaning of so extraordinary a Favour or of indulging herself in the flattering Prospect of future Royalty  THE TALE of  Geneura From the  Italian  of  Lodovico Ariosto  in the Fifth Book of his  Orlando Furioso  THE noble  Rilando  sailing to  England  whither he was sent on an Embassy by the Emperor  Charlemaine  a violent Storm arose which continuing two Days and Nights drove him at last on the Coast of  Scotland  His Fleet arriving safe he ordered his Retinue to meet him at  Berwick  himself without any Attendants struck into the famous Forest of  Caledonia  not without a Hope of meeting with some Adventure worthy his Courage and Virtue  While he was pleasing himself with this Expectation sometimes riding and sometimes walking a slow Pace leading his Horse Night drew on and he now began to think it necessary to go in quest of a Lodging Perceiving an Abbey at some Distance he remounted his  Horse and rode up to it The Abbot and his Monks seeing a Stranger of a noble Appearance at their Gate came out and with great Civility invited him to pass the Night there  Rinaldo  gratefully accepted their Offer and being conducted to a Chamber and an elegant Repast served to the Table as soon as he had satisfied the Cravings of an Appetite made eager by Travel and long Fasting he enquired of the good Fathers what noble Exploits in Arms had been lately performed in their Neighbourhood and whether a Warrior might hope to find any Occasions there of signalizing his Valour  'Tis certain replied the Abbot that many great and wonderful Adventures have been atchieved in this Forest but as the Place so are the Actions obscure and buried in Oblivion Hovever if Honour be your Pursuit the present time affords you a fit Opportunity to acquire it the Danger indeed is great but if you succeed eternal Fame will be your Reward The young and beautiful  Geneura  the Daughter of our King is accused by a Knight named  Lurcanio  of having violated her Chastity and it being provided by our  Scottish  Laws that all Damsels of what Rank soever who are publickly charged with Incontinence shall suffer the Punishment of Fire unless a Champion be found who will undertake their Defence and fight with the Accuser  Geneura  in Consequence of this Law has been adjudged to die and only a Month's Space allowed her to procure a Defender of her Life and Honour The King anxious for his Daughter's Safety but more for her Reputation has caused it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions that by whatever Person provided his Birth he not absolutely base his Daughter shall be delivered from the Danger that threatens her to him shall the Princess be given in Marriage with a Portion suitable to her high Rank and Quality  This Enterprize noble Stranger is worthy your Youth your Courage and Generosity The Law of Arms requires all true Knights to undertake the Defence of injured and oppressed Ladies and surely a fairer than  Geneura  is not to be found from one Extremity of the Globe to the other nor if common Opinion may be relied on a chaster  And is it possible said  Rinaldo  after a little Pause that this fair Princess is condemned to die for having generously rewarded the Passion of a faithful Lover Cursed be the Makers of so hard a Law more cursed they that are influenced by it For me it matters not whether  Geneura  be justly or unjustly accused what has been imputed to her as a Crime were I her Judge she should be applauded for had she taken care to have avoided Discovery and as it is I am resolved to defy her Accuser to Combat and I trust shall be able to deliver  her from the unjust and cruel Punishment she has been doomed to  The Abbot and Monks overjoyed that they had procured a Champion for their Princess lavished a thousand Praises on  Rinaldo  for his generous Design and he full of Impatience to begin the glorious Enterprize being furnished by his Hosts with a Guide set out early the next Morning for the  Scottish  Court leaving the good Fathers charmed with his Courage and Gallantry and offering up repeated Prayers to Heaven for his Success  As they were pursuing their Journey through Byeroads for the greater Expedition a Cry as of some Person in Distress rouzed all their Attention Instantly  Rinaldo  clapped Spurs to his Horse and bending his Course towards the Place from whence the Noise proceeded he came to a deep Valley surrounded with Trees through the Branches of which he perceived a young Maid struggling to free herself from the Hands of two Ruffians who were attempting to murder her Transported with Rage at this Sight the generous  Rinaldo  flew to the Relief of the distressed Damsel his Appearance so terrified the intended Murderers that they left their Prey and fled with the utmost Precipitation  Mean time the Maid recovered from her Fright thanked her Deliverer with a Transport of Joy and Gratitude and was beginning to acquaint him with the Story of her Misfortunes  when he who had not alighted being eager to pursue his Journey commanded his Guide to take her up behind him and as they travelled having at leisure observed her Countenance and Behaviour he was so much struck with the Beauty of the one and the soft and gentle Modesty of the other that his Curiosity was awakened and he became solicitous to know by what means she had been brought into so cruel a Situation  His Request being inforced with kind Assurances of future Protection the Damsel with a low Voice and Eyes cast down in a graceful Confusion began in this manner  Since you my generous Deliverer have commanded me to relate my Misfortunes prepare to hear a Tale more full of Horror an Act of greater Villainy and Baseness than  Athens Thebes  or  Argos  ever knew Ah 'tis no Wonder that our barren Clime is curst with a long Winter's ceaseless Rage  Phoebus  disdains to shine upon a Land where such inhuman Crimes are perpetrated Deeds black as Darkness and fit to be covered with everlasting Night unhappy as I am I bore but too great a Share in those I am going to relate  From my earliest Youth I was brought up in the Palace with the Daughter of our King honoured with a near Attendance on her Person and happy in the Possession of her Affection and Esteem Long might I have enjoyed this delightful Situation but Love ah  that ever so sweet a Passion should prove the Source of so much Misery Love interrupted my Tranquillity subjected my whole Soul and gave me up to Guilt to Shame and unavailing Penitence  The Duke of  Alban  was the Subject of my Virgin Wishes my Youth and Person pleased him skilled as he was in every deluding Art by which the false and the designing Part of his Sex betray the unexperienced of ours is it any Wonder that I was deceived Fond of believing what I wished and judging of his Passion by my own I yielded to his Desires and vainly hoped this Sacrifice of my Honour would secure to me for ever the Possession of his Heart  Our guilty Commerce lasted some Months during which time I always received his Visits in a Summer Apartment belonging to the Princess my Mistress into which as it was now the most rigid Season of the Year she never entered and being also in a Part of the Palace little frequented and the Windows opposite to some ruined Houses my Lover could come thither unobserved and by the Help of a silken Cord which I let down to him easily ascend the Chamber  All Sense of Virtue being now subdued and my whole Soul sunk in a dear lethargick Dream of Pleasure I never once suspected that as my Passion increased that of my Lover was decreasing Ah my too violent Love favoured  his Deceit or soon I might have perceived that he feigned much and loved but little  At length notwithstanding my Prepossession his Coldness became visible I sigh'd I wept I reproach'd alas how unavailing are all Endeavours to revive a decaying Passion satiated by Possession and constant only to Inconstancy  Polynesso  so was my faithless Lover named languished in secret for the bright  Geneura  my royal Mistress I know not if this Passion commenced before my Ruin was compleated or whether her more powerful Charms was the Cause of his Infidelity but certain it is that relying on the fervent Love I bore him he made no Scruple to confess his Flame even to me urging me by all the Arguments his wicked Mind could suggest to move the Heart of  Geneura  in his Favour  Ah my Lord judge if this cruel Man was dear to me ever solicitous to procure his Happiness and soothed by his Assurances that Ambition was the prevailing Motive of his Address to the Princess in which if he succeeded he vowed to keep me still his and that I should Share with her his Person and his Heart I consented to all he proposed and following his Instructions took all Opportunities of praising him to my Mistress  The Duke of  Alban  was the constant Subject of my Discourse I extolled his Valour his Generosity his illustrious Birth the manly  Graces of his Person the mingled Sweetness and Dignity of his Manners the charming Theme transported me out of myself with eager Pleasure I ran over all his Virtues dwelt with Delight on every imputed Charm scarce could my Tongue keep Pace with the overflowings of my lovesick Fancy fond of the dear Indulgence of talking in a personated Character of him I loved  But when in Compliance with his Injunctions I ventured to insinuate his Passion for her then only did I speak with Coldness and Restraint slowly the unwilling Words found way checked by my rising Sighs and prefaced by my Blushes My Emotions could not have been hid from an interested Observation but the Princess was not only wholly indifferent to  Polynesso  but indulged a secret Passion for the allaccomplished  Ariodant  This young Knight an  Italian  by Birth came with his Brother to the Court of  Scotland  either in pursuit of Glory or to transact some secret Business with the King To the Graces of his Form than which Nature never made one more lovely is added a Mind fraught with whatever is most great and excellent in Mankind his Valour never yet found an equal in our Land his is the Prize at every Tournement his the foremost Honours of the Field in Peace the Ornament of our Court in War the Defender of our Country  The King to whom he had indeared himself by a thousand Services loaded him with  Riches and Honours and gave him the first Employments in the Kingdom the Hill of  Sicily  burns not with fiercer Fires nor glows  Vesuvius  with more ardent Flames than those which the bright Eyes of our Princess kindled in the Heart of  Ariodant  I soon discovered that  Geneura  approved encouraged and returned his Passion and being as you may easily imagine not greatly concerned at this Obstacle to the Desires of my faithless Duke I acquainted him with all I knew and from the apparent Impossibility of his ever succeeding in his Attempt drew Arguments to induce him to give it over  Polynesso  naturally haughty and vindictive could not bear with Patience the Thoughts of being rejected for a Stranger Every way as he conceived his Inferior Disdain Shame Rage by turns engrossed his Soul and banished thence every softer Passion his Love for  Geneura  was now converted to the most obstinate Hatred and he resolved to accomplish her ruin by the blackest Treason that ever was conceived in the Heart of Man  His Scheme of Revenge concerted in which I alas tho' ignorantly was to act the chiefest Part he one Day accosted me with an Air more tender and affectionate than usual  My dear  Dalinda  said he generous and kind as you have been to me well may you think yourself injured by my Inconstancy  but as Trees you know when cropt by the Pruner's Hand shoot out into fresh luxuriant Branches so on the Root of my Passion for  Geneura  young Buds of Fondness rise and all the ripening Fruit is yours  Nor do I languish so much for the Possession of  Geneura  's Beauties as I Disdain to be thus rejected and contemned and lest this Grief should prey too forcibly on my Heart do thou my Fair indulge my sick Fancy with a kind Deceit and in the Dress of that too haughty Charmer receive me to thy Arms  When the Princess is retired to Bed put on her Robes adorn thee with her richest Jewels with her Girdle bind thy swelling Bosom let her Coronet glitter on thy beauteous Brow and beneath it let thy Hair descend in graceful Curls like hers then in her borrowed Form attend my coming at the wellknown Window thus shall my Pride be gratified and my capricious Fancy pleased  Without reflecting on the insidious Purport of this Request I promised to comply with it and for many successive Nights received him in the Habit he prescribed Having thus wrought me to his Wish his wicked Arts were next played off on  Ariodant  Before the Duke had any Knowledge of his Passion for the Princess he had lived in strict Friendship with this young Knight and thence  took Occasion to reproach him with the Breach of it by presuming to address the Princess  In you said he I little expected a Rival as well on Account of your Attachment to me as the Improbability of your succeeding in your Attempt for you are not now to be told of the mutual Passion that has long joined  Geneura  's Heart and mine nor that I intend soon to ask the King's Consent to espouse her why then do you fondly thrust yourself between me and my almost certain Happiness how differently should I act were I in your Place  Why this to me my Lord replied  Ariodant  hastily 'tis you who have betrayed our Friendship you have commenced my Rival not I yours I claim a prior Right in fair  Geneura  as haveing loved her first and have been happy enough to inspire her with an equal Flame this you might have perceived had you not been blinded by Obstinacy since then the Laws of Friendship demand one of us to yield be yours the Task as having less Right to persist and less Hope of succeeding than myself In Riches indeed you are my Superior but the King's Favour is equally shared betwixt us and in the Heart of  Geneura  the Advantage is wholly mine  What Errors does not Love Occasion replied the Duke each thinks himself the happy Object of her Wishes and yet 'tis certain that only one is loved Thus then let us decide the Contest he who can give the most certain  Proofs of her Affection shall be left by the other in the free and undisturbed Possession of it but first let us bind ourselves by the most solemn Oaths not to disclose each others Secret  To this  Ariodant  with trembling Impatience agreed and the artful Duke went on in this Manner  'Tis now almost five Months since the beautious  Geneura  rewarded my ardent Love with the Possession of her Person oft has the conscious Queen of Night lent me her shades to guide me to my Charmer and seen me happy in her Arms  'Tis false by Heaven interrupted  Ariodant  transported with Rage not that cold Queen whose Name thou hast profaned is chaster than my  Geneura  Traitor with my good Sword I'll prove thou lyest take Notice I defy thee to mortal Combat and will with thy dearest Blood wash away the Slanders thou hast thrown upon my Princess  Moderate your Rage said the calm Villain I mean to give you Proofs convincing Proofs of what I have said your own Eyes shall be Witnesses of the Favours I enjoy  The unhappy  Ariodant  pale trembling and lost in speechless Grief and Horror at those fatal Words stood for some Moments fixed in racking Thought like the sad Statue of Despair then raising his Eyes overflowing  with Tears to Heaven and passionately striking his groaning Breast and can it be he cried that my  Geneura  that Princess whom I loved whom I adored with such pure Reverence as mortals pay to Deities should become the Prey of loose Desires and give her faithful  Ariodant  to Death Oh 'tis impossible though a God spoke it I should say t'were false  Incredulous Man said  Polynesso  have I not offered to give thee Proofs that cannot be denied thy Eyes shall see the Favours she bestows on me  I take you at your Word resumed  Ariodant  impatiently give me to behold her Guilt and I am satisfyed  To morrow Night said the Duke I have an Appointment with her I will conduct you to a Place from whence unperceived you yourself shall behold me ascend her Chamber Window and judge by the Reception she gives me if I am happy in her Favour  To this the almost distracted  Ariodant  consented and at the appointed Time followed the Duke to those ruined Houses I mentioned before and there stood concealed from View Being doubtful of  Polynesso  's Intentions he had ordered his Brother  Lurcanio  to arm and go with him directing him to stay at a convenient Distance so as to be within call if any Treachery was offered him but not in Sight of  Geneura  's  Window for he would have no Witness of her Guilt but himself  The Duke having placed  Ariodant  most conveniently for his Purpose advanced and gave the usual Sign unhappy as I am I heard and eagerly obeyed the welcome Summons adorned in  Geneura  's richest Robes and covered with the Veil that Princesses only wear I appeared at the Window and threw the Silken Ladder over to my Lover  Lurcanio  either fearing for his Brother's Safety or desirous of prying into his Secrets quitted his appointed Station and unperceived by him walked softly forward till he came within ten Paces of  Ariodant  and now my faithless Duke was seen by both the Brothers though known only to  Ariodant  to ascend the Ladder and gain the Chamber Window at which I met him with a tender Embrace wandering over his Lips and Eyes with eager Kisses  This Sight so enflamed the Soul of  Ariodant  with Rage and Grief that drawing out his Sword and fixing the Pummel of it in the Ground he was going to rush with all his Force upon the Point had he not been prevented by  Lurcanio  who perceiving his rash Design sprang to him in an Instant and having thrown aside the fatal Instrument of Death received his sinking Brother in his Arms  Ah miserable Brother said  Lurcanio  by what wild Fury art thou possest to fall thus meanly for a Woman Now cursed forever cursed be all the Kind may they all perish in one wide Ruin blown as they are like Clouds with every blast of Wind and this fair Mischief that has betrayed thee let us devise some glorious Vengeance for her Let not thy noble Life be sacrificed to her Falshood her's is the Crime be her's the Punishment proclaim her Guilt aloud accuse her to the King my Eyes as well as thine have seen her Infamy and with my Sword I'll make good thy Assertion  Ariodant  whose Soul was torn with various and conflicting Passions smiled gloomily at the Mention of Revenge a while he seemed to bury every Thought of Grief and of Despair in that one Hope of sacrificing the guilty Lover to his Wrongs But alas the cureless Wound remained behind  Geneura  base as she appeared he loved with such unceasing Fondness that wholly unable to endure her Loss and dreading no Hell like that within his Bosom once more he resolved to die  To  Lurcanio  however he dissembled his Design and went Home with him at his Request but early the next Morning he departed leaving no Traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what Place he was gone  Lurcanio  dreading the fatal Effects of his Despair was pierced to his inmost Soul at the  News of his Flight the King and the whole Court took Part in his Affliction no Methods were left untried to discover where he was Messengers were sent in search of him to the utmost Extremities of the Kingdom But all returned without any Success  At length a Peasant came to Court and at his Request was introduced to the Princess who informed her that as he was travelling to the City he met  Ariodant  that this unhappy Knight obliged him to follow him and be Witness of an Act he was going to perform that obeying his Orders they journeyed on together till they came to a steep Rock that hung pendant over the Sea fronting the  Irish  Island  Ariodant  said the Peasant ascending this Rock commanded me to observe well what he did to give you an Account of it and tell you his last Words which were that he had seen too much Then springing furiously from the top of the Rock he precipitated himself into the Sea Terrified at the dreadful Sight I hastily turned back and travelled hither to bring you the fatal News  Geneura  overwhelmed with Grief and Amazement for the Death of her Lover and the strange Message he had sent her abandoned herself to the most violent Excesses of Despair she beat her beautious Bosom tore her Hair and in the wildness of her Woe a thousand Times invoked the dear loved Name of  Ariodant  repeated the mysterious Words he uttered and as often called on Death to end her  The News of his Death with the sad Manner of it spread Grief and Consternation through the whole City even the remotest Parts of  Scotland  felt and lamented the loss of their valiant Defender the King and the whole Court bewailed his loss with the sincerest Sorrow but  Lurcanio  superior in Grief as more nearly interested in the dear deceased mourned his unhappy Brother with all the tenderness of fraternal Love and all the warmth of Friendship  Revolving in his Mind the fatal Adventure of the Window which had been the Cause of his Brother's Distraction the Desire and Hope of Revenge afforded some Relief to the poignancy of his Woe and obstinately bent to sacrifice the Princess to the  Manes  of his  Ariodant  he presented himself before the King and Council and accused her of Incontinence relating all that  Ariodant  and he had seen and the fatal Effects it had upon him he then reminded the King of the  Scottish  Laws against unchastity and loudly demanded Justice on the Princess  Horror and Amazement seized the Soul of the unhappy Father  Geneura  tho' dearer to him than Life tho' innocent in his Opinion he has not Power to screen from the Danger that threatens her the Laws indeed permit  the accused to have a Champion to fight in her Defence by whom if the Prosecuter who is obliged to maintain by Force of Arms the Truth of his Assertion is worsted she is declared guiltless of the Crimes laid to her Charge  To this only Remedy the King has Recourse and causes it to be proclaimed throughout his Dominions that if any Knight of noble Birth will undertake the Defence of his Daughter and by Force of Arms shall vanquish her Accuser on him he will bestow the Princess with a Dower suitable to her Quality  Notwithstanding this Proclamation no Knight has yet offered himself for the Enterprize deterred therefrom by the known Valour of  Lurcanio  the King no less anxious for  Geneura  's Reputation than her Life caused all her Maids to be brought to a Tryal who with one Voice declared they never were privy to any Intrigue of their royal Mistress  Alarmed at these Proceedings and dreading the Consequence of a further Scrutiny I urged the Duke to take some Measures for our common Security he with dissembled Kindness praised my Secrecy and Affection and sent two Men to conduct me to a Castle of his at a great Distance from the Court  Wholly relying on his Faith I put myself under the Protection of those two Villains whom the Duke desirous of removing for ever the only Person who could discover his Guilt  ordered when they came to a convenient Place to murder me happily for me Chance conducted you that Way you delivered me from my impending Fate and while it shall please Heaven to preserve my unhappy Life it shall be spent in grateful Acknowledgments to my Protector  This Account of  Geneura  's Innocence was extreamly welcome to  Rinaldo  for tho' confiding in his own Courage he was not without Hopes of delivering her guilty as she appeared yet the certainty that he was going to fight in a just Cause animated him with double Fires and gave him almost a Confirmation of Victory  Now clapping Spurs to his Horse he rode on with such eager Haste that the noble Town of  St Andrews  soon appeared in View There the Combat was to be performed the Guards had already surrounded the Lists the Challengers Trumpet had sounded and the unhappy King pale trembling and full of eager Anxiety listened with a beating Heart and fearchecked Wishes for an accepting Answer  Mean time  Rinaldo  having left the frighted  Dalinda  at an Inn with repeated Assurances of gaining her Pardon in case he vanquished the Princess's Accuser advanced towards the Citygate Here he was met by a young Page who informed him that an unknown Knight clad all in sable Armour was arrived that he had demanded the Combat with  Lurcanio  and declared he would die or  free the Princess from her ignominious Sentence  Rinaldo  impatient to unfold the Mystery thundered at the Citygates which being opened he rode eagerly to the Lists there beholding the Combatants engaged he forced his Way through the Press and crying aloud that they should cease the Fight demanded an instant Audience of the King  The Marshals of the Field thereupon parted the two Champions and  Rinaldo  was immediately conducted to the King to whom he related the whole Story of  Polynesso  's Treachery as he had received it from  Dalinda  adding that he would prove the Truth of it by Force of Arms and begged he might be allowed to defy the Traitor Duke to single Combat  The noble Form of  Rinaldo  but chiefly the pleasing Purport of his Speech gained him absolute Credit with the King Scarce could the raptur'd Parent restrain the wild Exultings of his Joy at this Confirmation of his  Geneura  's Innocence dearer than Life or Empire was she loved by him and freely would he have sacrificed both to save her Honour He hesitated therefore not a Moment in permitting the requested Combat but ordered Duke  Polynesso  to be called  He by his Office of High Constable haveing the ordering of the Combat was riding proudly about the Field exulting in his successful  Treason and anticipating in his own Mind the Ruin of the fair and injured  Geneura  ignorant though he was of the Design of this Summons yet coward Guilt suggesting the worst he had to fear with a disordered Air and Eyes expressive of the various Apprehensions that struck his conscious Soul he met the reproachful Look of his King and the fierce Glances of  Rinaldo  That noble Warrior repeating in a few Words the Treasons he had been guilty of challenged him to the Field  Polynesso  denied the Accusation but accepting the proferred Combat because he could not avoid it retired to arm himself while  Rinaldo  fraught with the pious Prayers and Blessings of the King entered the Lists and ordered his Trumpet to sound  At the third Blast the Duke appeared pale Terror and Dismay were pictured in his Face his fainting Heart throbbed with the conscious Pangs of Guilt and Horrors of impending Fate confused distracted not knowing what he did he darted forwards at the Signal given to begin the Fight but his weak Lance illguided by his trembling hand fell harmless to the Ground  Not so the great  Rinaldo  he with calm Courage and Brave yet unassuming Confidence meditated the Wound and rising all collected to the Blow threw his famed Lance with such unerring Skill and Force that it  pierced quite through the Armour of  Polynesso  and hid its fatal Point within his Side  The Traitor fell  Rinaldo  eagerly dismounted and approaching him unlaced his Helmet With faint low Voice he called for Mercy and thinking to deserve it confessed unasked the Wrong he had been guilty of to  Geneura  then as if Life had been only lent him till he had cleared her Innocence scarce had he uttered another Prayer for Mercy but Death supprest the coward Supplication and he lay a breathless Coarse at the Feet of  Rinaldo  The People transported with Joy that their Princess was not only delivered from Death but restored to her former sanctity of Character made the Air resound with their Acclamations  Rinaldo  being conducted to the King untied the Beaver of his Helmet and was immediately known to be that famous Knight of  Italy  whose noble Exploits were noised over all the habitable World  The King embraced him in a rapture of Joy and Gratitude the Nobles crouded round the Deliverer of their Princess loaded him with Blessings and strove to exceed each other in Praises of his invincible Valour  These Congratulations over all Eyes were turned upon the unknown Knight in black Armour who had so generously undertaken  the Defence of  Geneura  against her Accuser  Lurcanio  pensive he stood during the Fight between  Polynesso  and  Rinaldo  his Eyes fixed upon the Combatants with eager Attention he had listened to the dying Words of the treacherous Duke and while the Multitude in loud shouts expressed their Joy and the King and Court were paying Honours to the glorious Victor he stood apart from the Throng absorbed in Thought and wholly insensible of the Tumult around him  The King caused him to be conducted to his Presence and acknowledging himself greatly obliged to his generous Intention pressed him to let him know in what manner he could repay the Obligation  The Knight made no Answer but bowing low and throwing off his Helmet the King and Court with the utmost Astonishment beheld the lovely Face of  Ariodant  Wonder and Joy kept them all silent for a while at length the King recovering from his Surprize clasp'd the young Warrior to his Breast with a tender Embrace  Is it possible said he in a Tone of Voice expressive of the strongest Transport that I behold again my  Ariodant  the gallant Defender of my Dominions and the brave Champion for my Daughter's Honour him whom I lamented as dead whom my whole Kingdom mourned for tell me by what strange yet happy Chance I now behold thee living whose  Death was so confidently affirmed and so universally believed  Ariodant  knowing the King was acquainted with the whole Story of his Love replied without Reserve  The Peasant my Lord whom I detained to be a Witness of the sad Effects of my Despair and to bring the News of it to the Princess informed her truly that I cast myself from the Rock into the Sea but that natural Repugnance we have all to Death when near however we may despise its Terrors at a Distance impelled me involuntarily to use Measures to preserve a Life which a Moment before I had been so desirous of losing  As soon as I rose again upon the Surface of the Waves I applied myself to swimming at which I was very expert and soon reached the neighbouring Shore faint weary and almost breathless I threw myself down amidst the Rushes and was found in this Condition by an ancient Hermit whose Cell was at a small Distance  Thither he conducted me and in a few Days his charitable Cares restored me to my Strength but alas my Mind was tortur'd still with various Passions Love Hate Despair and eager Thirst of Vengeance by Turns possessed me in vain I sought to banish the Idea of  Geneura  from my Soul it still returned with double Force nor could her Infidelity of  which mistaken Wretch that I was I thought I had such convincing Proofs weaken the Power of her resistless Charms  Thus languishing with a cureless Wound I heard the News of her Accusation by my Brother and the Danger to which her Life and Honour were exposed At that Moment forgetting the Injuries I had suffered insensible to all the Tyes of Consanguinity and Friendship and only solicitous for her Safety I determined to fight with my Brother in her Defence pleasing myself with the Thought that if I did not free her I should at lest have the Satisfaction of dying in her Cause and thereby proving how much Superior to  Polynesso  was my Love who though favoured as he was by her he wanted Courage to defend her  Having provided myself with Armour that might effectually conceal me I came hither full of Fury against my Brother whom I could not but consider as my worst Enemy since he was the Accuser of the still adored  Geneura  The Arrival of the brave  Rinaldo  happily prevented the Continuance of a Combat which must have ended in the Death of one Brother and eternal Remorse to the other  With Joy I behold the Princess delivered from the ignominious Death with which she was threatened but oh with far more Rapture do I congratulate your Majesty on this Discovery of her Innocence Happy  Rinaldo  to  be at once the Defender of her Life and Restorer of her Honour As for me I sought only to preserve her from Death and if that was denied me to have the Satisfaction at least of dying in her Defence by the Hand of a Friend and Brother  The King who loved him before for his Virtues was so charmed with this generous Proof of his Passion for his Daughter that he easily yielded to the Solicitations of  Rinaldo  and the Noblemen of his Court to bestow the Princess on so faithful a Lover and endowing her with the Dutchy of  Albania  which on  Polynesso  's Decease reverted to the Crown he gave her Hand to  Ariodant  in the Presence of the whole Court and the Nuptials were soon after celebrated with the utmost Magnificence  Rinaldo  having obtained  Dalinda  's Pardon who retired into a Monastery took leave of the King and happy Lovers and pursued his Voyage to  England  PLAN OF  Much ado about nothing  DON  Pedro  Prince of  Arragon  returning from a successful Battle and attended by his Bastard Brother Don  John  and two young Noblemen stop at  Messina  in  Sicily  the Governor of which Place is his Friend Here they are invited to stay a Month  Claudio  one of the young Noblemen falls in Love with  Hero  Daughter to the Governor and acquainting the

departs to learn as he says the Day of Marriage  In the mean Time the Governor Don  Pedro Claudio  and  Hero  form an innocent Stratagem to make  Benedict  and  Beatrice Leonato  's Niece in Love with each other which succeeds Don  John  tells his Brother and  Claudio  that  Hero  is a Strumpet which they not immediately crediting he offers to conduct them to a Place where they shall be Witnesses of an Assignation between her and his Servant  Borachio Claudio  hereupon declares that if he  finds her dishonoured he will disgrace her the next Day in Church by refusing to marry her and publicly assigning the Cause of his Refusal  The next Mo  ning they meet at Church the Priest is going to begin the Ceremony when  Claudio  who had been effectually imposed upon by  Margnret  's personating her Mistress taxes  Hero  with incontinence and refuses to give his Hand to as he calls her "an approved Wanton" The Prince adds that himself his Brother and Count  Claudio  had heard her the last Night hold shameful Converse with a loose Ruffian from her Chamber Window  The unhappy Father overwhelmed with Grief and Shame reproaches his Daughter with her Guilt she faints the Prince  Claudio  and the Bastard Don  John  go out the Friar having observed  Hero  's Looks and Behaviour with great Attention declares it to be his Opinion that she is Innocent advises  Leonato  to give it out that she is dead and patiently expect the Issue  Don  Pedro  and  Claudio  afterwards passing through the Street meet  Borachio  and  Conrade  in the Custody of some Constables Don  Pedro  asks for what Cause his Brother's Servants were thus guarded  Borachio  confesses the Treasons he had practiced against  Hero  for the Sake of a Bribe given him by Don  John  which having told in Confidence to his Friend had  been overheard by the Watch and occasioned their being taken into Custody  Claudio  now passionately laments the Death of the injured  Hero Leonato  to whom the whole Plot had been related by the Sexton enters and reproaches  Claudio  with his easy Credulity  Claudio  professes his Sorrow for what is past and offers to satisfy him for the Part he had in the Death of his Daughter by suffering any Penance he shall impose upon him  Leonato  then desires him to visit his Daughter's Tomb hang an Epitaph of his own composing upon it sing it to her Bones that Night and the next Morning marry his Brother  Antonio  's Daughter who  Herö  being dead was Heiress to the Possessions of them both  Claudio  readily agrees to all and after performing the Ceremony of singing his own Verses at the Tomb of  Hero  repairs to  Leonato  's House there  Hero  is presented to him in a Masque as the Daughter of  Antonio  and being asked if he persisted in his Resolution of marrying to which he answers in the Affirmative she unmasques and discovers herself to be  Hero  Benedick  then humourously claiming  Beatrice  both Marriages are agreed upon and Don  John  who had fled upon News that his Treachery had been discovered is taken and brought back to  Messina  to receive his Punishment  This Fable absurd and ridiculous as it is was drawn from the foregoing Story of  Geneura  in  Ariosto  's  Orlando Furioso  a Fiction which as it is managed by the Epic Poet is neither improbable nor unnatural but by  Shakespear  mangled and defaced full of Inconsistencies Contradictions and Blunders The defaming a Lady by means of her Servant personating her at her Chamberwindow is the Subject pursued by both  Shakespear  by changing the Persons altering some of the Circumstances and inventing others has made the whole an improbable Contrivance borrowed just enough to shew his Poverty of Invention and added enough to prove his want of Judgment  The Scheme for ruining the Lady in the Original is formed and executed by a rejected Lover who sees a Rival his inferior in Rank and Fortune preferred before him and loses at once the Object of his Wishes and the Prospect of increased Honours by that Preference Ambition and the Desire of Revenge are Passions strong enough in a Mind not very virtuous to produce Acts of Baseness and Villainy  Polynesso  urged by those powerful Incentives contrives to blacken  Geneura  's Fame which produces a Separation between her and her Lover and prevents a Stranger from marrying this Princess and consequently enjoying those Honours he so ardently desired himself  Don  John  in the Play is a Villain merely through the Love of Villainy and having entertained a capricious Dislike to  Claudio  closes eagerly with his Confident's horrid Scheme for breaking off his Marriage with  Hero  To prevent the multiplying such outrageously wicked and therefore unnatural Characters Don  John  himself might have been the Proposer of that black Contrivance against the innocent  Hero  and  Borachio  for the sake of the thousand Ducats that was afterwards given him by Don  John  be induced to execute it But here we have two Villains equally bad both governed by the same detestable Principles acting upon the same Motives and such a perfect Parity in their Manners that they are only distinguished from each other by their Names  When  Borachio  tells Don  John  to go to his Brother and maintain confidently that  Hero  is a loose Wanton Don  John  asks what Proof he shall make of that "Proof enough says the other to misuse the Prince vex  Claudio  undo  Hero  and kill  Leonato  look you for any other Issue"  Claudio  only is the Object of Don  John  's Hatred yet the chief Force of rhe intended Injury is to fall on  Hero  and  Leonato  her Father towards whom he has no Malice and he is made to engage in this wicked Enterprize to procure the Ruin and Death of two Persons he  hates not to give a little Vexation to one he does These Absurdities have their Rise from the injudicious Change of the Characters The Contrivance to slander  Hero  is not less ridiculous and this also is occasioned by the Poet's having deviated from the Original to introduce his own wild Conceits  Borachio  tells Don  John  that he is highly favoured by  Margaret Hero  's waiting Woman that he will persuade her to dress in her Lady's Cloaths assume her Name and talk to him out of her Chamberwindow all which Don  Pedro  and  Claudio  being Witnesses of would effectually convince them that  Hero  was dishonoured  But  Borachio  does not acquaint Don  John  and through him the Audience what Colour he will give to this strange Request in order to induce  Margaret  to grant it  Margaret  is all along represented as faithful to her Mistress it was not likely she would engage in a Plot that seemed to have a Tendency to ruin  Hero  's Reputation unless she had been imposed on by some very plausible Pretences what those Pretences were we are left to guess which is indeed so difficult to do that we must reasonably suppose the Poet himself was as much at a Loss here as his Readers and equally incapable of solving the difficulty he had raised  That  Borachio  should be the suspected Gallant of  Hero  is a Circumstance also highly improbable  Borachio  a mean Dependant on  a Man whose Vices had made him the Object of universal Hatred and Contempt a Stranger almost in  Messina  and as well on Account of the Meanness of his Situation as the Profligacy of his Manners excluded from any Acquaintanee with a Lady of  Hero  's Quality  Yet how easily does Don  Pedro  the Friend and  Claudio  the Lover of the Lady swallow this gross Scandal that must even derive Improbability from the Person who utters it for he is neither an honest Man nor a Friend of  Claudio  who is thus solicitous to prevent his dishonouring himself by marrying a bad Woman but a Wretch noted for his Propensity to all Kinds of Mischief and Villainy an inveterate Hater of  Claudio  and but a little while before at open Enmity with Don  Pedro  his Brother  Surely these Circumstances were sufficient to make the Prince and  Claudio  doubt the Truth of this Story which the Character of the Teller considered as well as the Improbability of the Facts seemed much more likely to be contrived to produce Mischief than prevent it  The Proof Don  John  offers them in support of his Assertion could have no Weight with Minds less stupidly credulous than theirs they are to be shewn  Hero  talking to her Gallant  Borachio  out of her Chamber window very unlikely that  Hero  should be so imprudent as the Night before her intended Marriage to have an Assignation with a Gallant in so  publick a Place but their own Eyes and Ears are to be Witnesses of this Conference strong Evidence indeed if it be realy  Hero  that they see and hear but if it be only  Margaret  drest in her Ladies Cloaths with such powerful Reasons as they had before to believe the whole a Fiction how could this gross Fallacy impose upon them  We are not told that  Margaret  was so very like her Lady that in the same Cloaths they could not be distinguished from each other their Eyes are to be deceived by her Dress but how if her Face happens as certainly was the Case not to be exactly like  Hero  's it cannot be pretended that it was so dark that they could not distinguish her Features The same Degree of Light that shewed her Cloaths to be  Hero  's would discover the Face to be  Margaret  's  Let it be granted however that their Sight was deceived though all Things considered it is not possible to conceive how yet as they heard plainly all the Discourse that passed between the Counterfeit  Hero  and her Lover why did not the Voice of  Margaret  discover the Cheat Strange Absurdity Let us see how the Original has provided against all these Objections  The Duke of  Alban  who is secretly in love with the Princess  Geneura  having seduced a young Maid that attended on her Person prevailed upon her by extravagant Promises that were contrived to please at once her Ambition  and weaken the Force of her Jealousy to assist him in his Design of gaining her royal Mistress for his Wife discovering by her Means that the Princess had not only a Dislike to him but had bestowed her Heart upon  Ariodant  Rage and Despair suggest to him a Scheme for interrupting the Happiness of the two Lovers and gratifying his Revenge which was now his predominant Passion he tells  Dalinda  that if she wishes to see him cured of his hopeless Love for the Princess she must assume as much of her Appearance as the wearing her Apparel and rich Ornaments could give her and thus disguised receive him to her Arms  Dalinda  willing to revive her Lover's decaying Passion by an Artifice that flattered her own Vanity fondly agrees to his Proposal and for many successive Nights meets him at the usual Place of Assignation which was in the Princesses Summer Apartment drest in her Cloaths  Polynesso  having succeeded thus far reproaches  Ariodant  with his breach of Friendship in addressing  Geneura  of whose Affections he was in absolute Possession  Ariodant  insists that himself is the favoured Lover the Duke to convince him of the contrary conducts him to a Place from whence he could see him ascend the Princesses Chamber  Dalinda  in Shape and Statue not much differing from her Mistress her Face shaded by the royal Veil that  Geneura  and only  Geneura  was accustomed to wear standing as usual at  the Chamber Window lets down the silken Cord to her Lover and receives him with a tender Embrace  Ariodant  maddening at this Sight believes his Mistress false and  Polynesso  's Treachery produces all the Effects he could have wished  Here the Contrivance is plausible enough the Characters are properly distinguished each acts upon Motives probable and natural and the Incidents that follow are the necessary Result of those Actions Why  Shakespear  rejected these Circumstances for others wholly inconsistent and ridiculous is not easy to guess we shall find him altering the succeeding Part of the Plot with the same utter disregard to probability and contempt of Decorum  Margaret  having done her Part towards defaming her Mistress without knowing any Thing of the Matter though her Discourse with  Borachio  was calculated to raise the most injurious Suspicions assists her next Morning to dress for her Wedding attends her to the Church hears the designed Bridegroom refuse her Hand proclaim her a Wanton and urge her last Night's loose Discourse with  Borachio  from her Chamber Window as a Proof Yet all the while she appears wholly insensible of what had happened neither concerned for her Mistress whom she had ruined without Design nor anxious for her own Safety that seemed to depend upon a candid Confession for it was not likely her Treachery could be long concealed Thus supernaturally if what is out  of Nature may be called above it is the Plot brought to perfection nor is the unravelling of it less happily imagined  Borachio  having received his promised Ducats from Don  John  the Moment after his Conference with  Margaret  was ended meets an Acquaintance of his named  Conrade  in the Street to whom he is impatient to communicate his good Luck  'Tis true the Secret is of Importance and if known endangers his Life the Place also is very improper for such a Conversation being the Street and near  Leonato  's House where the Scene of his Treachery had been acted add to this that the Rain obliges them to stand close up to the Door which exposes them to the Inconvenience of having even their Whispers overheard if any one was near it Yet such is  Borachio  's extream eagerness to tell his wicked Exploit that he never thinks of carrying his Friend to his own Lodgings where he may boast in Safety but in a rainy Night stands in the Street close to the Door of the Man whose Daughter he had injured and there at his leisure relates the whole treacherous Contrivance  However all this happens exactly right because the Watch who is posted about  Leonato  's House hear every Syllable that is spoken and understanding that one of these Villains had defamed the Lady  Hero  and made her intended Bridegroom resolve to disgrace her the nex  Morning in Church by publicly refusing to  marry her on account of her being dishonoured they sieze the two Wretches with an Intent to bring them before  Leonato  not that same Night to prevent the Lady's Disgrace but the next Morning when all was over to discover her Innocence  Two or three absolute Ideots are here very artfully introduced for Constable and Watchmen for had they the lest Ray of Reason to direct them they must have conceived that it was absolutely necessary to acquaint  Leonato  immediately with the Treason that had been practised against his Daughter in order to prevent the ignominious Treatment she was to suffer in Consequence of it the next Morning  This Method of protracting the Discovery is not indeed very ingenious but the Poet's Occasions are answered by it and that is sufficient  Claudio  's designed Vengeance suffered no Interruption the Lady is shamefully refused hence arise two or three new Contrivances she is believed to be dead  Claudio  engages to marry another in a Masque and when he has given his Hand to this unknown Lady is surprized with the Sight of his living  Hero  whose Death after he had been convinced of her Innocence he had passionately lamented These Incidents were they ever so natural cannot affect the Readers either with Pity or Surprize since they are let into the Secret beforehand and can anticipate the Catastrophe  Shakespear  has deviated from the Original as much in the drawing his Characters as the Disposition of his Plan Nothing can be more different than the Sentiments and Behaviour of  Ariodant  and  Claudio  in Circumstances nearly alike Both are representedas passionate Lovers happy in the Possession of their Mistresses Affections yet prevailed upon to think them false through the Treachery of a Villain but  Ariodant  yields only to the strongest Conviction  Claudio  to the grossest Artifice  Ariodant  's Grief Rage and Jealousy terminate in a fixed Despair which prompts him to lay violent Hands on his own Life  Claudio  is actuated by a Desire of Revenge and that of the meanest Sort for he suffers the supposed Gallant to escape and only meditates the Ruin of the Lady  Ariodant  fights with his own Brother to preserve the Life of her who had injured him  Claudio  without any necessity exposes his Mistress publickly in Church brings Ruin and Contempt on her and everlasting Shame and Affliction on her poor Father to whom he had been obliged for an hospitable Reception and an intended Benefit  Claudio  is mean selfish ungenerous and cruel Qualities that are seldom found in the Heroe and Lover and he is represented as both  Ariodant  is always consistent with his Character too brave to be actuated by a mean Desire of Revenge too much in love to be guided by Reason hence arises the several Extravagancies he is guilty of but in all the Manners of the Soldier and Lover are inviolably preserved  There is a great Deal of true Wit and Humour in the Comic Scenes of this Play the Characters of  Benedict  and  Beatrice  are properly marked and beautifully distinguished  THE HISTORY OF  LEIR  King of the BRITAINS From  Holingshed  's Chronicle  "LEIR  the Son of  Baldub  was admitted Ruler over the  Britains  in the Year of the World At what Time  Joas  reigned as yet in  Juda  This  Leir  was a Prince of noble Demeanor governing his Land and Subjects in great Wealth He made the Town of  Cairleir  now called  Leicester  which standeth upon the River of  Dore  It is  writ that he had by his Wife three Daughters without other Issue whose Names were  Gonorilla Regan  and  Cordilla  which Daughters he greatly loved but especially the youngest  Cordilla  far above the two Elder  When this  Leir  was come to great Years and began to wear unweildy through Age he thought to understand the Affections of his Daughters towards him and prefer her whom he best loved to the Succession of the Kingdom Therefore he first asked  Gonorilla  the eldest how well she loved him the which calling her Gods to record protested that she loved him more than her own Life which by Right and Reason should be most dear unto her with which Answer the Father being well pleased turned to the second and demanded of her how well she loved him which answered confirming her Sayings with great Oaths that she loved him more than Tongue can express and far above all other Creatures in the World  Then called he his youngest Daughter  Cordilla  before him and asked of her what accompt she made of him Unto whom she made this Answer as followeth Knowing the great Love and fatherly Zeal you have always borne towards me for the which that I may not answer you otherwise than I think and as my Conscience leadeth me I protest to you that I have always loved you and shall continually while I live love you as my natural Father and if you would more understand of the Love  that I bear you assertayn yourself that so much as you have so much you are worth and so much I love you and no more  The Father being nothing content with this Answer married the two eldest Daughters the one unto the Duke of  Cornwall  named  Henninus  and the other unto the Duke of  Albania  called  Maglanus  and betwixt them after his Death he willed and ordained his Land should be divided and the one half thereof should be immediately assigned unto them in Hand but for the third Daughter  Cordilla  he reserved nothing  Yet it fortuned that one of the Princes of  Gallia  which now is called  France  whose Name was  Aganippus  hearing of the Beauty Womanhood and good Conditions of the sayd  Cordilla  desired to have her in Marriage and sent over to her Father requiring that he might have her to Wife to whom Answer was made that he might have his Daughter but for any Dowry he could have none for all was promised and assured to her other Sisters already  Aganippus  notwithstanding this Answer of Denyall to receive any Thing by way of Dower with  Cordilla  took her to Wife only moved thereto I say for respect of her Person and amiable Virtues This  Aganippus  was one of the twelve Kings that ruled  Gallia  in those Days as in the  British  History it is recorded But to proceed after that  Leir  was fallen into Age the two Dukes that had married his two  eldest Daughters thinking it long ere the Government of the Land did come to their Hands arose against him in Armour and rest from him the Governance of the Land upon Conditions to be continued for tearme of Life By the which he was put to his Portion that is to live after a Rate assigned to him for the Maintenance of his Estate which in process of Time was diminished as well by  Maglianus  as by  Henninius  But the greatest Grief that  Leir  took was to see the Unkindness of his Daughters who seemed to think that all was too much which their Father had The same being never so little in so much that going from the one to the other he was brought to that Misery that they would allow him only one Servant to wait upon him In the End such was the unkindness or as I may say the unnaturalness which he found in his two Daughters notwithstanding their fair and pleasant Words uttered in Time past that being constrained of Necessity he fled the Land and sailed into  Gallia  there to seek some Comfort of his youngest Daughter  Cordeilla  whom before he hated  The Lady  Cordeilla  hearing he was arrived in poor Estate she first sent to him privately a Sum of Money to apparel himself withall and to retain a certain Number of Servants that might attend upon him in honorable Wise as apperteyned to the Estate which he had borne And then so accompanyed she appointed him to come to the Court which he did and was  so joyfully honorably and lovingly received both by his Son in Law  Aganippus  and also by his Daughter  Cordeilla  that his Heart was greatly comforted For he was no less honoured than if he had been King of the whole Country himself Also after that he had informed his Son in Law and his Daughter in what sort he had been used by his other Daughters  Aganippus  caused a mighty Army to be put in readiness and likewise a great Navy of Ships to be rigged to pass over into  Britain  with  Leir  his Father in Law to see him again restored to his Kingdom  It was accorded that  Cordeilla  should also go' with him to take Possession of the Land the which he promised to leave unto her as his rightful Inheritour after his Decease notwithstanding any former Grants made unto her Sisters or unto their Husbands in any Manner of wise hereupon when this Army and Navy of Ships were ready  Leir  and his Daughter  Cordeilla  with her Husband took the Sea and arriving in  Britain  fought with their Enemies and discomfitted them in Battle in the which  Maglanus  and  Henninus  were slain and then was  Leir  restored to his Kingdom which he ruled after this by the Space of two Years and then died forty Years after he first began to reign His Body was buried at  Leicester  in a Vault under the Channel of the River  Dore  beneath the Town"  FABLE Of the TRAGEDY of King  LEAR  LEAR  King of  Britain  being old and weary of the Toils of Government determines to resign his Crown and divide his Dominions amongst his three Daughters two of whom were married to the Dukes of  Cornwall  and  Albany  and the third addressed to by the King of  France  and Duke of  Burgundy  The Princessess being commanded by their Father to declare with what Degree of Affection each loves him that he may know which of them is intitled to the greatest Share of his Bounty  Gonerill  the eldest begins with assuring him that she loves him beyond every Thing that is most dear and precious in the World  Regan  the second Daughter professes herself an Enemy to all other Joys but that of loving and being beloved by him To each of these  Ladies the old King assigns one third of his Kingdom  Then addressing himself in a particularly tender Manner to  Cordelia  his youngest Daughter he asks her what she has to say to draw a Dowry more opulent than her Sisters  Cordelia  tells him Nothing the King surprised bids her speak again she with a modest plainness replies That she loves him as a dutiful Child ought to love an indulgent Father neither more nor less  The King enraged at this Speech bids her avoid his Presence declares that he will banish her for ever from his Heart and divides that Portion of his Kingdom which he had design'd for her between her two Sisters Then giving his Crown to  Cornwall  and  Albany  he requires of them in return only Maintenance for himself and an hundred Knights  The Earl of  Kent  for opposing this frantick Resignation and offering to Plead in favour of  Cordelia  is banished for ever by the old King The King of  France  marries  Cordelia  without a Portion and takes her away with him  Goneril  and  Regan  soon grow weary of their old Father and agree to treat him with Contempt He is first affronted by  Goneril  's Attendants and she treating his Complaints of their rude Behaviour with Lightness and objecting to the number of his Followers which she wants to have reduced to Fifty the King  leaves her in a Rage and repairs to the Court of his Daughter  Regan  who having received an Account of what had pass'd from her Sister comes to the Earl of  Gloster  's Castle in order to avoid him  Lear  in his way stopping at  Gloster  's Castle meets his two Daughters there they both join to treat him with the utmost Cruelty and absolutely refuse to give him Entertainment in either of their Palaces unless he disbands all his Knights and submits to be attended by their Servants  The old King in an agony of Grief and Rage at this barbarous and unnatural Treatment from his two Daughters to whom he had given all rushes out of the Castle declaring he will not stay under the same Roof with them They who desire nothing so much as his Absence command the Earl of  Gloster  to shut his Gates and suffer him to go whither he pleases The Earl represents to them that the King must inevitably Perish in the Storm which then raged with the utmost Violence there being no House nor Shed within several Miles to Shelter him and humbly intreats that he may be allowed to follow his old Master and invite him in The wicked Princesses peremptorily forbid him to afford their Father any Relief and threaten'd him with Death if he Disobeys  Notwithstanding this the Earl secretly seeks for the King whose Griefs had now turned  his Brain and conveys him to a Farmhouse Afterwards being informed that there was a Plot laid to take away his Life he enjoins his Attendants to carry him to  Dover  and furnishes them with Necessaries for that Purpose  Edmund  the Bastard Son of  Gloster  having by his wicked Arts prevailed upon his Father to Disinherit his lawful Son  Edgar  and to resolve his Death now betrays his Father himself and Discovers to the two enraged Princesses what he had done for the old King  Gloster  is seiz'd bound and his Eyes trod out by the Duke of  Cornwal  and in this miserable Condition thrust out of his own Castle and contemptuously bid to smell his way to  Dover  The injured  Edgar  who had assum'd the Appearance of a mad Man to elude an undeserved Punishment from his Father meets him in this miserable Condition and still keeping himself unknown offers to be his Guide and lead him to whatever Place he has a mind to go  Gloster  overwhelmed with Despair desires to be conducted to a Hill near  Dover  from whence he means to cast himself into the Sea  Edgar  still counterfeiting the mad Man leads his Father to  Dover  and thinking to cure his Despair by seeming to give way to it yet preventing its Effects tells him that they have gain'd the Summit of the Hill  Gloster  bids him lead him to the Verge of it then taking leave of the supposed mad Man springs Forwards with an Intention to precipitate himself to the Bottom but falls flat on the level Plain  Edgar  approaches him and changing his Voice expresses the extreamest Amazement at his having fallen from such an enormous Height without being bruis'd to Peices  Gloster  supposing himself miraculously preserved declares that he will no more attempt to put an End to his miserable Life but wait patiently for his Dissolution  Edgar  confirms him in those Thoughts and offers to conduct hlm to some Retreat As they are going the Princess  Regan  's Steward who had been sent with Letters from her and her Sister to the Bastard  Edmund  meets them and seeing  Gloster  on whose Head a Price had been set offers to murder him  Edgar  defends his Father and kills the Steward and searching his Pockets finds a Letter from the Princess  Goneril  to his Brother in which she desires him to Assassinate her Husband the Duke of  Albany  and promises to Reward him for that Action with her Hand  Edgar  reserves this Letter for a Proof of his Brother's wickedness and having placed his Father in Safety joins the  French  Army that with their Queen  Cordelia  at their Head had  come into  England  to revenge the Injuries offered to  Lear  and to restore him to his Crown  The Duke of  Albany  though he detested the cruel Usage that  Lear  had received raises an Army to oppose  Cordelia  The Princess  Regan  whose Husband had been killed by one of his Servants as he was stamping on  Gloster  's Eyes gives the Command of her Forces to the Bastard  Edmund  with whom she as well as her Sister is in love and joins her Brotherinlaw  Before the Armies engage  Edgar  disguised gives the Duke of  Albany  his Wife's Letter which he had taken from the Steward bids him read it and if Victory declares on his Side a Champion will appear at the first Sound of the Trumpet to prove the Truth of what is contained therein  After this the Battle is fought the  English  are victorious  Lear  and  Cordelia  are taken Prisoners and  Edmund  gives secret Orders to the Officer who guards them to put them to death  The Duke of  Albany  having read the Letter by which he discovered his Wife's Adultery and  Edmund  's Crimes arrests him for high Treason and declares if at the Sound of the Trumpet no Champion appears to prove it by Force of Arms himself will undertake the Combat and maintain the Charge  The Trumpet sounds  Edgar  appears in Arms and after summing up his Brother's Crimes challenges him to the Combat they fight  Edmund  is mortally wounded  Edgar  then discovers himself relates the Hardships he had suffered the Condition in which he found his miserable Father what he had done for him and how upon his discovering himself to him the strong Surprise Grief and mingled Rapture siezed with such Force upon his Heart already almost broken with his Miseries that he expired in the Arms of the banished Earl of  Kent  who in the Disguise of a menial Servant had contrnually followed the distressed King  Edmund  struck with Remorse at this melancholy Tale confesses all his Crimes asks Pardon of his Brother and willing to do some Good before he dies owns the secret Orders he had given to put  Lear  and  Cordelia  to death and urges them to send and prevent the Execution of them  The Messenger arrives too late  Cordelia  had been just strangled by a Soldier whom the old King had afterwards killed  Lear  brings  Cordelia  in dead in his Arms and while he is lamenting over her dies  The good Earl of  Kent  expires immediately after with Grief  Goneril  and  Regan  poisoned by each other through Jealousy die in Torments and  Edmund  also dies by the Wound  he had received from his Brother who is by the Duke of  Albany  restored to his Estates and Honours  This Fable although drawn from the foregoing History of King  Lear  is so altered by  Shakespear  in several Circumstances as to render it much more improbable than the Original There we are sufficiently disgusted with the Folly of a Man who gives away one Half of his Kingdom to two of his Daughters because they flatter him with Professions of the most extravagant Love and deprives his youngest Child of her Portion for no other Crime but confining her Expressions of Tenderness within the Bounds of plain and simple Truth  But  Shakespear  has carried this Extravagance much farther he shews us a King resigning his Kingdom his Crown and Dignity to his two Daughters reserving nothing to himself not even a decent Maintenance but submitting to a mean Dependance on the Bounty of his Children whom by promising Rewards proportionable to the Degree of Flattery they lavish on him he has stimulated to outvie each other in artful Flourishes on their Duty and Affection toward him  Tell me Daughters  Since now we will divest us both of Rule  Int'rest of Territory Cares of State  Which of you shall we say doth love us most  That we our largest Bounty may extend  Where Nature doth with Merit challenge  Goneril  Our eldest born speak first  What Wonder when thus bribed  Goneril  should answer  I love you Sir  Dearer than Eyesight Space and Liberty  Lear  does not run mad till the third Act yet his Behaviour towards  Cordelia  in this first Scene has all the Appearance of a Judgment totally depraved he asks  Cordelia  what she has to say to draw a Dowry more opulent than her Sisters  Thus he suggested to her a Motive for exceeding them in Expressions of Love the noble Disinterestedness of her Answer afforded the strongest Conviction of her Sincerity and that she possessed the highest Degree of filial Affection for him who hazarded the Loss of all her Fortune to confine herself to simple Truth in her Professions of it yet for this  Lear  banishes her his Sight consigns her over to Want and loads her with the deepest Imprecations What less than Phrenzy can inspire a Rage so groundless and a Conduct so absurd  Lear  while in his Senses acts like a mad Man and from his first Appearance to his last seems to be wholly deprived of his Reason  In the History  Lear  Disinherits  Cordelia  but we read of no other kind of Severity exerted towards her The King of  France  as well in  the History as the Play charm'd with the Virtue and Beauty of the injured  Cordelia  marries her without a Portion  Shakespear  does not introduce this Prince till after the absurd Trial  Lear  made of his Daughters Affection is over The Lover who is made to Marry the disinherited  Cordelia  on account of her Virtue is very injudiciously contrived to be Absent when she gave so glorious a Testimony of it and is touch'd by a cold Justification of her Fame and that from herself when he might have been charm'd with a shining Instance of her Greatness of Soul and inviolable Regard to Truth  So unartfully has the Poet managed this Incident that  Cordelia  's noble Disinterestedness is apparent to all but him who was to be the most influenced by it In the Eyes of her Lover she is debased not exalted reduced to the abject Necessity of defending her own Character and seeking rather to free herself from the Suspicion of Guilt than modestly enjoying the conscious Sense of superior Virtue  Lear  's Invective against her to the King of  France  is conceived in the most shocking Terms  I would not from your Love make such a stray  To Match you where I Hate therefore beseech you  T'avert your Liking a more worthy Way  Than on a Wretch whom Nature is asham'd  Almost t'acknowledge her's  Well might the King of  France  be startled at such Expressions as these from a Parent of his Child had he been present to have heard the Offence she gave him to occasion them how must her exalted Merit have been endeared to him by the extream Injustice she suffered but as it is a bare Acquittal of any monsterous Crime is all the Satisfaction she can procure for herself and all the Foundation her Lover has for the Eulogium he afterwards makes on her  CORDELIA  I yet beseech your Majesty  If for I want that glib and oily Art  To speak and purpose not since what I well intend  I'll do't before I Speak that you make known  It is no vicious Blot Murther or Foulness  No unchast Action or dishonour'd Step  That hath depriv'd me of your Grace and Favour  But ev'n for want of that for which I'm richer  A still soliciting Eye and such a Tongue  That I am glad I've not though not to have it  Hath lost me in your Liking  LEAR  Better thou  Hadst not been Born than not to have pleased me better  From this Speech of  Cordelia  's and  Lear  's Answer  France  collects Matter for extenuating  a supposed Error in his Mistress not for Admiration of her Worth  FRANCE  Is it but this a Tardiness in Nature  Which often leaves the History unspoke  That it intends to do  Yet a Moment after without knowing any more of the Matter he lavishes the warmest Praises on her Virtues and offers to make her loaded as she is with her Father's Curses and deprived of the Dower he expected with her Queen of  France  This Conduct would be just and natural had he been a Witness of her noble Behaviour but doubtful as it must have appeared to him in such perplexing Circumstances 'tis extravagant and absurd  Shakespear  has deviated widely from History in the Catastrophe of his Play the Chronicle tells us that King  Lear  having been dispossessed by his rebellious Sons in Law of that Half of the Kingdom which he had reserved for himself and forced by repeated Indignities from his Daughters to take Refuge in  France  was received with great Tenderness by  Cordelia  who prevailed upon her Husband to attempt his Restoration accordingly an Army of  Frenchmen  pass'd over into  Britain  by which the Dukes of  Cornwal  and  Albany  being defeated King  Lear  was restored to his Crown died in Peace two Years after and left his Kingdom to  Cordelia  In  Shakespear  the Forces of the two wicked Sisters are victorious  Lear  and the pious  Cordelia  are taken Prisoners she is hanged in Prison and the old King dies with Grief Had  Shakespear  followed the Historian  he would not have violated the Rules of poetical Justice he represents Vice punished and Virtue rewarded in the Play one Fate overwhelms alike the Innocent and the Guilty and the Facts in the History are wholly changed to produce Events neither probable necessary nor just  Several Incidents in this Play are borrowed from the History of the old Prince of  Paphlagonia  in  Sidney  's  Arcadia  which I shall here Transcribe  "IT was in the Kingdom of  Galacia  the Season being as in the Depth of Winter very cold and as then sodainly Grown to so extream and foul a Storm that never any Winter I think brought forth a fowler Child so that the Princes were even compelled by the Hail that the Pride of the Wind blew in their Faces to seek some shrowding Place which a certain hollow Rock offering unto them they made it their Shield against the Tempest's Fury And so staying there till the Violence thereof was passed they heard the Speech of a Couple who not perceiving them being hid within the rude Canupie held a strange and pitiful Disputation which made them Step out yet in such Sort as they might see unseen  There they perceived an aged Man and a young scarcely come to the Age of a Man both poorly arrayed extreamly Weatherbeaten the old Man blind the young Man leading him and yet through all these Miseries in both there seemed to appear a Kind of Nobleness not suitable to that Affliction But the  first Words they heard were these of the old Man  Well  Leonatus  said he since I cannot persuade thee to lead me to that which should end my Grief and thy Trouble let me now intreat thee to leave me Fear not my Misery cannot be greater than it is and nothing doth become me but Misery Fear not the Danger of my blind Steps I cannot Fall worse than I am and do not I pray thee do not obstinately continue to infect thee with my Wretchedness but fly fly from this Region only worthy of me  Dear Father answered he do not take away from me the only Remnant of my Happiness while I have Power to do you Service I am not wholly miserable  Ah my Son said he and with that he groaned as if Sorrow strove to break his Heart how evil fits it me to have such a Son and how much doth thy Kindness upbraid my Wickedness  These doleful Speaches and some others to like Purpose well shewing they had not been born to the Fortune they were in moved the Princes to go out unto them and ask the younger who they were  Sirs answered he with a good Grace and made the more agreeable by a certain noble Kind of Piteousness I see well you are Strangers that know not our Misery so well here known that no Man dare know but that we must be miserable indeed our State is such as though nothing is so needful unto us as Pity yet nothing is more dangerous unto us than to make ourselves so known as may stir Pity  but your Presence promiseth that Cruelty shall not overrun Hate and if it did in Truth our State is sunk below the Degree of Fear This old Man whom I lead was lately rightful Prince of this Country of  Paphlagonia  by the hardhearted Ungratefulness of a Son of his deprived not only of his Kingdom whereof no foreign Forces were even able to spoile him but of his Sight the Riches which Nature grants to the poorest Creatures whereby and by other his unnatural Dealings he hath been driven to such Grief as even now he would have had me to have led him to the Top of this Rock thence to cast himself headlong to Death and so would have made me who received my Life of him to be the Worker of his Destruction But noble Gentlemen said he if either of you have a Father and feel what dutiful Affection is ingrafted in a Son's Heart let me entreat you to convey this afflicted Prince to some Place of Rest and Security amongst your worthy Acts it shall be none of the least that a King of of such Might and Fame and so unjustly oppressed is in any Sort by you relieved  But before they could make him Answer his Father began to Speak Ah my Son said he how evil an Historian are you that leave out the chief Knot of all the Discourse My Wickedness my Wickedness and if thou doest it to spare my Eares the only Sense now left me proper for Knowledge assure yourself thou doest mistake me And I take Witness of that Sun which you see with that he cast up his blind Eyes as if he would Hunt for Light  and wish myself in worse Case than I do wish myself which is as Evill as may be if I Speak untruly that nothing is so welcome to my Thoughts as the publishing of my Shame Therefore know you Gentlemen to whom from my Heart I wish that it may not prove some ominous Foretoken of Misfortune to have met with such a Miser as I am that whatsoever my Son o God that Truth binds me to Reproach him with the Name of my Son hath said is true But besides those Truthes this also is true that having had in lawful Marriage of a Mother fit to bear Royal Children this Son such a one as partly you see and better shall know by my short Declaration and so enjoyed the Expectations in the World of him till he was grown to justilfy their Expectations so as I needed envy no Father for the chief Comfort of Mortality to leave another onesself after me I was carried by a Bastard Son of mine if at least I be bound to believe the Words of that base Woman my Concubine his Mother first to mislike then to hate lastly to destroy or to do my best to destroy this Son I think you think undeserving Destruction what Ways he used to bring me to it if I should tell you I should tediously trouble you with as much poisonous Hypocrisy desperate Fraud smooth Malice hidden Ambition and smiling Envy as in any living Person could be harbour'd But I list it not no Remembrance of Naughtiness delights me but mine own and methinks the accusing his Traps might in some Manner excuse my Fault which certainly I loth to do But the Conclusion is that I  gave Orders to some Servants of mine whom I thought as apt for such Charities as myself to lead him out into a Forrest and there to kill him But those Thieves better natured to my Son than myself spared his Life letting him go to learn to live poorly which he did giving himself to be a private Soldier in a Country here by but as he was ready to be greatly advanced for some noble Pieces of Service which he did he heard News of me who Drunk in my Affection to that unlawful and unnatural Son of mine suffered myself to be governed by him that all Favours and Punishments passed by him all Offices and Places of Importance distributed to his Favourites so that ere I was aware I had left myself nothing but the Name of King which he shortly weary of too with many Indignities if any Thing may be called an Indignity which was laid upon me threw me out of my Seat and put out my Eyes and then proud in his Tyranny let me go neither imprisoning nor killing me but rather delighting to make me feel my Misery Misery indeed if ever there were any full of Wretchedness full of Disgrace and fullest of Guiltiness And as he came to the Crown by so unjust Means as unjustly he kept it by Force of Stranger Soldiers in Cittadels the Nests of Tyranny and Murderers of Liberty disarming all his own Countrymen that no Man durst shew himself a well willer of mine to say the Truth I think few of them being so considering my cruel Folly to my good Son and foolish Kindness to my unkind Bastard but if there were any  who felt a Pity for so great a Fall and had yet any Sparks of unstaine Duty left in them towards me yet durst they not shew it scarcely with giving me Alms at their Doors which yet was the only Sustenance of my distressed Life nobody daring to shew so much Charity as to lend me a Hand to guide my dark Steps till this Son of mine God knows worthy of a more virtuous and more fortunate Father forgetting my abominable Wrongs not recking Danger and neglecting the present good Way he was in of doing himself good came hither to do this kind Office you see him perform towards me to my unspeakable Grief not only because his Kindness is a Glass even to my blind Eyes of my Naughtiness but that above all Griefs it grieves me he should desperately adventure the loss of his well deserving Life for mine that yet owe more to Fortune for my Deserts as if he would carry Mudde in a Chest of Chrystal for well I know he that now reigneth how much soever and with good Reason he despiseth me of all Men despised yet he will not let slip any Advantage to make away him whose just Title enobled by Courage and Goodness may one Day shake the Seat of a never secure Tyranny and for this Cause I craved of him to lead me to the Top of this Rock indeed I must confess with meaning to free him from so Serpentine a Companion as I am but he finding what I purposed only therein since he was born shewed himself disobedient to me And now Gentlemen you have the true Story which I pray you publish to the World that my mischievious Proceedings may be the Glory of his filial Piety the only Reward  now left for so great a Merit and if it may be let me obtain that of you which my Son denies me for never was there more Pity in saving any than in ending me both because therein my Agony shall end and so you shall preserve this excellent young Man who else wilfully follows his own Ruin  The Matter in itself lamentable lamentably expressed by the old Prince which needed not take to himself the Gestures of Pity since his Face could not put off the Marks thereof greatly moved the two Princes to Compassion which could not stay in such Hearts as theirs without seeking Remedy But by and by the Occasion was presented for  Plexirtus  so was the Bastard called came thither with forty Horse only of purpose to murder this Brother of whose coming he had soon Advertisement and thought no Eyes of sufficient Credit in such a Matter but his own and therefore come himself to be Actor and Spectator and as soon as he came not regarding the weak as he thought Guard of but two Men commanded some of his Followers to set their Hands to his in the killing of  Leonatus  but the young Prince though not otherwise armed but with a Sword how falsely soever he was dealt with by others would not betray himself but bravely drawing it our made the Death of the first that assailed him warn his Followers to come more warily after him But then  Pyrocles  and  Musidorus  were quickly become Parties so just a Defence deserving as much as old Friendship and so did behave them among that Company more injurious than  valiant that many of them lost their Lives for their wicked Master  Yet perhaps had the Number of them at last prevailed if the King of  Pontus  lately by them made so had not come unlooked for to their Succour who having had a Dream which had fixed his Imagination vehemently upon some great Danger presently to follow those two Princes whom he most dearly loved was come in all Haste following as well as he could their Track with an Hundred Horses in that Country which he thought considering who then reigned a fit Place enough to make the Stage of any Tragedy  But then the Match had been so ill made for  Plexertus  that his illled Life and worsegotten Honour should have tumbled together to Destruction had there not come in  Tydeus  and  Telenor  with forty or fifty in their Suit to the Defence of  Plexirtus  These two were Brothers of the noblest House of that Country brought up from their Infancy with  Plexirtus  Men of such Prowess as not to know Fear in themselves and yet to teach it in others that should deal with them for they had often made their Lives triumph over most terrible Dangers never dismayed and ever fortunate and truly no more settled in Valour than disposed to Goodness and Justice if either they had lighted on a better Friend or could have learned to make Friendship a Child and not a Father of Virtue But bringing up rather the Choice having first knit their Minds unto him indeed crafty enough either to hide his Faults or never to shew them but when they  might pay home they willingly held out the Course rather to satisfy him than all the World and rather to be good Friends than good Men so as though they did not like the Evil he did yet they liked him that did the Evil and though not Counsellors of the Offence yet Protectors of the Offender  Now they having heard of this sudden going out with so small a Company in a Country full of evilwishing Minds toward him though they knew not the Cause followed him till they found him in such Case as they were to venture their Lives or else he to lose his which they did with such Force of Mind and Body that truly I may justly say  Pyrocles  and  Musidorus  had never till then found any that could make them so well repeat their hardest Lesson in the Feats of Arms And briefly so they did that if they overcame not were they not overcome but carried away that ungrateful Master of theirs to a Place of Security howsoever the Princes laboured to the contrary  But this Matter being thus far begun it became not the Constancy of the Princes so to leave it but in all Haste making Forces both in  Pontus  and  Phrygia  they had in few Days left him but only that one strong Place where he was for Fear having been the only Knot that had fastened his People unto him that once untied by a greater Force they all scattered from him like so many Birds whose Cage had been broken  In which Season the blind King having in the chief City of his Realm set the Crown upon his Son  Leonatus  's Head with many  Tears both of Joy and Sorrow setting forth to the whole People his own Fault and his Son's Virtue after he had kissed him and forced his Son to accept Honour of him as of his new become Subject even in a Moment died as it should seem his Heart broken with Unkindness and Affliction stretched so far beyond his Limits with this Excess of Comfort as it was no longer able to keep safe his vital Spirits  But the new King having no less lovingly performed all Duties to him dead than alive pursued on the Siege of his unnatural Brother as much for the Revenge of his Father as for the establishing his own Quiet"  The under plot of  Gloster  and his two Sons in the Tragedy of King  Lear  is borrowed from this foregoing short History of  Leonatus  several of the Circumstances closely copied and the Characters of the Brothers nearly the same  The Adventure of the Rock is heightened by  Shakespear  perhaps with too little Attention to Probability  Gloster  though deprived of Sight might easily be sensible of the Difference between walking on a level Plain and ascending a sleep and craggy Rock nor could he possibly suppose when he fell gently on that Plain that he had precipitated himself from an immense Height to the Margin of the Sea  Shakespear  in the pathetic Description he makes  Edgar  give of his Father's Death had certainly the following Passage of the  Arcadia  in his Eye "The blind King having in the chief City of his Realm set the Crown upon his Son  Leonatus  's Head with many Tears  both of Joy and Sorrow setting forth to the People his own Fault and his Son's Virtue after he had kissed him and forced his Son to accept Honour of him as of his new become Subject even in a Moment died as it should seem his Heart broken with Unkindness and Affliction stretched so far beyond his Limits with this Excess of Comfort as it was able no longer to keep safe his vital Spirits"  Sidney  EDGAR  I met my Father with his bleeding Rings  Their precious Gems new lost became his Guide  Led him begg'd for him sav'd him from Despair  Never O Fault reveal'd myself unto him  Until some half Hour past when I was arm'd  Not sure though hoping of this good Success  I asked his Blessing and from first to last  Told him my Pilgrimage but his flaw'd Heart  Alack too weak the Conflict to support  'Twixt two Extremes of Passion Joy and Grief  Burst smilingly  The Chronicle of  Holingshed  and  Sidney  's  Arcadia  are not the only Resources  Shakespear  had for his Tragedy of  Lear  if we may believe the Editor of a Collection of old Ballads published in the Year in his Introduction to an old Ballad called  A Lamentable Song of the Death of King  Lear  and his three Daughters  he has these Words  "I cannot be certain directly as to the Time when this Ballad was written but that it was some Years before the Play of  Shakespear  appears from several Circumstances which to mention would swell my Introduction too far beyond its usual Length"  It is to be wished that this Writer since he was resolved not to exceed a certain Length in his Introduction had omitted some Part of it in order to introduce those Circumstances that were of infinitely more Consequence than any thing else he has said on the Subject of that old Ballad if it was really written before  Shakespear  's Play that great Poet did not disdain to consult it but has copied it more closely than either the Chronicle or  Sidney  From thence for 'tis mentioned no where else he took the Hint of  Lear  's Madness and the extravagant and wanton Cruelty his Daughters exercised on him the Death of King  Lear  is also exactly copied  Spencer  seems to have furnished  Shakespear  with the Hint of  Cordelia  's Manner of Death In the tenth Canto of the second Book of his  Fairy Queen  he relates the Story of King  Lear  and his three Daughters  Cordelia  he tells us after having restored her Father to his Crown and succeeded to it after his Death was by her Sister's Children dethroned and confined a long Time in Prison so that overcome by Despair she hanged herself In  Shakespear Cordelia  does not hang herself but is hanged by a Soldier a very improper Catastrophe for a Person of such exemplary Virtue  The following is the old Ballad I have mentioned which bears so exact an Analogy to the  Argument of  Shakespear  's King  Lear  that his having copied it cannot be doubted if indeed it be true that it was written before that Tragedy  KIng  Leir  once ruled in this Land  With Princely Power and Peace  And had all Things with Heart's Content  That might his Joys increase  Amongst those Things that Nature gave  Three Daughters fair had he  So Princely seeming beautiful  As fairer could not be  So on a Time it pleas'd the King  A Question thus to move  Which of his Daughters to his Grace  Could shew the dearest Love  For to my Age you bring Content  Quoth he then let me hear  Which of you Three in plighted Troth  The kindest will appear  To whom the Eldest thus began  Dear Father mind quoth she  Before your Face to do you good  My Blood shall render'd be  And for your Sake my bleeding Heart  Shall here be cut in twain  E're that I see your rev'rend Age  The smallest Grief sustain  And so will I the Second said  Dear Father for your Sake  The worst of all Extremities  I'll gently undertake  And serve your Highness Night and Day  With Diligence and Love  That sweet Content and Quietness  Discomforts may remove  In doing so you glad my Soul  The aged King reply'd  But what say'st thou my youngest Girl  How is thy Love ally'd  My Love quoth young  Cordelia  then  Which to your Grace I owe  Shall be the Duty of a Child  And that is all I'll show  And wilt thou shew no more quoth he  Than doth thy Duty bind  I well perceive thy Love is small  When as no more I find  Henceforth I banish thee my Court  Thou art no Child of mine  Nor any Part of this my Realm  By favour shall be thine  Thy eldest Sisters Loves are more  Than well I can demand  To whom I equally bestow  My Kingdom and my Land  My pompous State and all my Goods  That lovingly I may  With those thy Sisters be maintain'd  Until my dying Day  Thus flatt'ring Speeches won Renown  By these two Sisters here  The third had causeless Banishment  Yet was his Love more dear  For poor  Cordelia  patiently  Went wand'ring up and down  Unhelp'd unpity'd gentle Maid  Through many an  English  Town  Until at last in famous  France  She gentler Fortunes found  Though poor and bare yet she was deem'd  The fairest on the Ground  Where when the King her Virtues heard  And this fair Lady seen  With full Consent of all his Court  He made his Wife and Queen  Her Father old King  Lear  this while  With his two Daughters staid  Forgetful of their promis'd Loves  Full soon the same deny'd  And living in Queen  Regan  's Court  The eldest of the twain  She took from him his chiefest Means  And most of all his Train  For whereas twenty Men were wont  To wait with bended Knee  She gave Allowance but to Ten  And after scarce to Three  Nay one she thought too much for him  So took she all away  In hope that in her Court good King  He would no longer stay  Am I rewarded thus quoth he  In giving all I have  Unto my Children and to beg  For what I lately gave  I'll go unto my  Gonoril    My Second Child I know  Will be more kind and pitiful  And will relieve my Woe  Full fast he hies then to her Court  Where when she hears his Moan  Return'd him Answer That she griev'd  That all his Means were gone  But no way could relieve his Wants  Yet if that he would stay  Within her Kitchen he should have  What Scullions gave away  When he had heard with bitter Tears  He made his Answer then  In what I did let me be made  Example to all Men  I will return again quoth he  Unto my  Regan  's Court  She will not use me thus I hope  But in a kinder Sort  Where when he came she gave Command  To drive him thence away  When he was well within her Court  She said he would not stay  Then back again to  Gonorill  The woful King did hie  That in her Kitchen he might have  What Scullion Boys set by  But there of that he was deny'd  Which she had promis'd late  For once refusing he should not  Come after to her Gate  Thus 'twixt his Daughters for Relief  He wander'd up and down  Being glad to feed on Beggars Food  That lately wore a Crown  And calling to remembrance then  His youngest Daughter's Words  That said the Duty of a Child  Was all that Love affords  But doubting to repair to her  Whom he had banish'd so  Grew frantick mad for in his Mind  He bore the Wounds of Woe  Which made him rend his milkwhite Locks  And Tresses from his Head  And all with Blood bestain his Cheeks  With Age and Honour spread  To Hills and Woods and watry Founts  He made his hourly Moan  Till Hills and Woods and sensless Things  Did seem so sigh and groan  Ev'n thus possess'd with Discontents  He passed o're to  France  In hope from fair  Cordelia  there  To find some gentler Chance  Most virtuous Dame which when she heard  Of this her Father's Grief  As Duty bound she quickly sent  Him Comfort and Relief  And by a Train of Noble Peers  In brave and gallant Sort  She gave in Charge he should be brought  To  Aganippus  ' Court  Whose Royal King whose Noble Mind  So freely gave Consent  To muster up his Knights at Arms  To Fame and Courage bent  And so to  England  came with Speed  To repossess King  Lear  And drive his Daughters from their Thrones  By his  Cordelia  dear  Where she truehearted Noble Queen  Was in the Battel slain  Yet he good King in his old Days  Possess'd his Crown again  But when he heard  Cordelia  's Death  Who dy'd indeed for Love  Of her dear Father in whose Cause  She did this Battel move  He swooning fell upon her Breast  From whence he never parted  But on her Bosom left his Life  That was so truly hearted  The Lords and Nobles when they saw  The Ends of these Events  The other Sisters unto Death  They doomed by Consents  And being dead their Crowns they left  Unto the next of Kin  Thus have you seen the Fall of Pride  And disobedient Sin  FINIS
