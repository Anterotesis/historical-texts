bonmots and anecdotes  Of Prince and Peasant Crowns and Cotes  And how surprised the rustics ran  To see the King was but a man  Wond'ring that bluecoat and bobwig  Were worn by one they thought so big  Great Gog or Magog's coat of mail  To cover him would surely fail  How stars and garters clowns did scare  And make them at a distance stare  With Mayors most loyally addressing  To beg of

Well thou saw'st not the King  Hobbs  No is he in the Country  How  He's hunting here at DraytonBasset  Mr Urban I should be obliged to any of your topographical friends to inform me why so many towns in North Wiltshire have the addition of  Basset  to their names as  Wotton Basset Compton Basset Berwick Basset  c c Every singularity of the kind should be traced to its source as it frequently produces exemplifications of an∣cient customs or leads imperceptibly to discussions of antiquity that seldom fail of rewarding us with some knowledge that was before lost to all but the incurious tenant of the soil H  Gentleman's Magazine  Part Page  The several towns in North Wiltshire which have the addition of  Basset  to their names derive it from their owner  Philip Basset  who had considerable property in the county and was a younger branch of the Bassets of Edendon there See Dugdale's Bar l PP  Idem  P  Hobbs  The devil he is God bless his mastership I saw a woman here that

widow because she is fair  King  Dost thou like him the worse for that  Hobbs  No by my feckens but the better for though I be but a plain Tanner I love a fair lass myself  King  Prithee tell me how love they King Edward  Hobbs  Faith as poor folks love holidaysGlad to have them now and then but to have them come too often would undo them so to see the King now and then is a comfort but to behold him every day would beggar us and I may say to thee under the rose we fear we shall be troubled to lend him money for we doubt he's but needy  King  Would'st thou not lend him money if he should need it  Hobbs  Yes by my holydame he shall have half my purse and I'll sell soleleather to help him to more  King  In faith now which lov'st thou best Harry or Edward  Hobbs  Nay that's a secret and two may keep it if one be away  King  Shall I say my conscience I think Harry is the true King  Hobbs  Art advised of that Harry's of the old house of Lancaster and that progenity do I love  King  Then dost thou hate the House of York  Hobbs  Why no for I am just akin to Sutton windmill I can grind which way soe'er the wind blow If it be Harry I can say well fare Lancaster if it be Edward I can sing York York for my money  King  Thou art of my mind for I say Harry is the lawful King Edward is but a usurper fool and a coward  Hobbs  Nay there thou lyest he has wit enough and courage enough dost thou not speak treason  King  Ay but I know to whom I speak it  Hobbs  Dost thou an I were constable I should be for∣sworn if I set thee not in the stocks for it  King  Well let it go no further for I did serve King Harry and I love him best though now I serve King Edward  Hobbs  Thou art the arranter knave to speak ill of thy master But sirrah what's thy name what office hast thou and what will the King do for thee  King  My name is Ned I am the King's butler and he will do more for me than for any nobleman in the court  Hobbs  The devil he will the more fool he and so I'll tell him if e'er I see him and I would I might see him in my poor house at Tamworth  King  Go with me to the court and I'll bring thee to the King and what suit soever thou have to him I'll warrant thee to speed  Hobbs  I ha' nothing to do at court I'll home with my cowhides but if the King will come to me he shall be welcome  King  Hast thou no suit touching thy trade to transport hides or have the sole selling of leather within a certain circuit or about bark or such like to have letters patent  Hobbs  By the mass I like not those patents for I think it's pity that only one subject should have what might do good to many throughout the land  King  Say'st thou me so Tanner well let's cast lots whether thou shalt go with me to Drayton or I go home with thee to Tamworth  Hobbs  Lot me no lotting I'll not go with thee if thou wilt go with me 'cause thou'rt my Liege's man and yet I think he has many honester thou shalt be welcome to John Hobbs thou shalt be welcome to beef and bacon and

are call'd  Concerns the King's most excellent majesty  Whose right you know by his progenitors  Unto the crown and sovereignty of France  Is wrongfully detained by the French  Which to revenge and royally regain  His highness means to put himself in arms  And in his princely person to conduct  His warlike troops against the enemy  But for his coffers are unfurnished  Through civil discord and intestine war  For York and Lancaster's disputed claim  Whose bleeding scars our eyes may yet behold  He prays his faithful loving subjects' help  To further this his just great enterprise  Hobbs  So the drift and meaning whereby as it were of all your long purgation Sir Humphrey Bowes is no more in some respect but that the King wants money and would ha' some of his commonality  Sir H  Tanner you rightly understand the matter  J Aston  Note this withall where his dread majesty  Our lawful sovereign and most royal King  Might have exacted or imposed a tax  Or borrow'd greater sums than we can

estimation  silk thread as ever thou saw'st  King  And I perhaps may wear it for her sake  In better presence than thou art aware of  Hobbs  How Ned a better present that can'st thou not have for silk cloth and workmanship why Nell made it manBut Ned is not the King in this company what's he in the white beard and red petticoat By the mass I misdoubt Ned that is the King I know it by my Lord Whatyecallum's players  King  How by them Tanner  Hobbs  Why ever when they play an Enterlout or a Com∣modity at Tamworth the King is always in a whitebeard and a redgown like him therefore I 'spect him to be the King  King  No trust me Tanner that is not the King but thou shalt see the King before thou goest and have a pardon for thy son with thee  Hobbs  Then what is he i'th'redgown and he

I care not for no meat my stomach is like to a sick swine's that will neither eat nor drink 'till she know what will become of her pigNed and Tom ye promised me a good turn when I came to Court either

Sovereign and my son O that ever I was born  King  Look to the Tanner chafe his temples Sirs  This unlook'd meeting and discovery  Have overpower'd his faculties  Hobbs  Let me aloneI'm a dead man  Ah my liege that ye should deal so with a poor simple  Tanner but its no matter I can but die  King  But when Tanner can'st thou tell  Hobbs  Nay e'en when ye please for I have so defended ye by calling ye plain Ned mad rogue and rascal that I know ye'll have me hang'd Therefore no more ado but let my son and I e'en be truss'd up togetherAnd here's another as honest as yourself no doubt ye made me call him plain Tom and I warrant his name is Thomas and some man of worship too therefore let's to our doom e'en when and where ye will  King  Tanner attend not only do we pardon thee  Thy plain and blunt tho' honest wellmeant speech  But in all princely kindness welcome thee  And thy son's trespass do we pardon too  Young Hobbs  kneels  With this observance that he sin no more  In suchlike sort

offend again my gracious liege  Let me not mercy nor e'en pity find  King  'Tis well Receive with kindness thy repentant son  And in return for what thou freely gav'st  To aid our enterprise 'gainst haughty France  We give to thee and thine in yearly fee  An hundred marks now Tanner what dost say  Hobbs  Why an'like your kingship I can scarce say at all but I thank yeI thank ye for my son's life
