 ANSWER OF PHILIP FRANCIS ESQ  ANSWER OF PHILIP FRANCIS ESQ TO THE CHARGE BROUGHT AGAINST SIR JOHN CLAVERING COLONEL GEORGE MONSON AND MR FRANCIS AT THE BAR OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE FOURTH OF FEBRUARY BY SIR ELIJAH IMPEY KNIGHT  LONDON PRINTED BY J JARVIS WILDCOURT LINCOLN'SINNFIELDS MDCCLXXXVIII  HOUSE OF COMMONS  Wednesday February    "The House according to Order resolved itself into a Committee of the whole House to consider further of the several Articles of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors against Sir  Elijah Impey  Knight late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal  Right Honourable William Windham Esq in the Chair  MR FRANCIS I flattered myself Sir that when the House thought proper to exclude me from the Committee of Managers appointed to conduct the impeachment of Mr Hastings whether that resolution was meant to be a discharge from a service or a relief  from a duty it would have this effect at all eventsthat from thenceforward I should be suffered to remain in a state of neutrality and that as I was deprived of the honour I should be exempted from the cares and censures to which the Managers of an Impeachment must unavoidably submit But much more had I reason to expect that after the public declaration which I made in Parliament two years ago  On the seventh of March    that I would never fit in judgement on Sir Elijah Impey and that I would never give a judicial vote in any cause in which he might be a party unless I could safely give it for him  having publicly avowed that declaration in print having since repeatedly declared to my friends particularly to the honourable Baronet  Sir Gilbert Elliot  near me that I would take no part in the prosecution of Sir Elijah Impey and having strictly adhered to the spirit of these declarations I should not be implicated in any shape in the impeachment of that gentleman Least of all did I expect that I should be accused by him of having borne testimony to his good conduct and compelled by him to answer as a criminal  for declarations which he tells you I have heretofore made in his favour I do not mean to deny his right of mixing accusation with defence if to criminate others be in any degree material or even useful to his own exculpation In some cases undoubtedly the weapons of attack are the best perhaps the only instruments of defence Whether the use he has made of these weapons and the manner in which he has availed himself of his undisputed right on this occasion be perfectly prudent or not can only be determined by the event All I contend for is that  I  in my turn may be allowed the same latitude which  he  has taken and which  I  allow him It is not my direct object this day to criminate him or any man but it  may  be necessary to my defence It may be unavoidable Defence and accusation in this particular case may be inseparable If that should happen I desire it may be remembered that besides the general right of attack which for myself I admit to belong to him and to every defendant I appeal to the specific use which he has made of it and follow the precedent which he has himself specifically set me  On some late occasions my situation in this House has been equally painful and invidious  I have been repeatedly marked as the personal object of debatethe middle passive subject between the action and reaction of the powers of the House between the hammer and the anvil If any man thinks there is any thing delightful or agreeable in such a distinction I am sure his opinion is not founded on experience I stand here now defendant against Sir Elijah Impey In that character at least I hope to be heard with patience and a liberal construction I desire no more  The charge produced by this gentleman against Sir John Clavering Colonel Monson and myself as I understood it and as precisely as I have been able to collect it from my notes and memory was in real amount and substance to this effect It is his own fault if I do not state it correctly  "That whereas we had by sundry declarations and minutes both before and after the event expressed or strongly intimated our opinion that the prosecution trial and execution of Nundcomar were founded on political motives and pursued for the sole purpose of saving Mr Hastings from the effect of that man's evidence no credit  ought to be given to the same because we had in a few days after the execution ordered a paper purporting to be a petition from Nundcomar against the Judges to be burnt the entries of it to be expunged and the translations to be destroyed and because I had on that occasion declared that I considered the insinuations contained in it as wholly unsupported and of a libellous nature and that to send a copy of it to the Judges would be giving it much more weight than it deserved"  If this be the charge I admit the premises and I deny the conclusion If it be  not  the charge I shall pause for a moment and wait to be informed  What is it  No man I think will say that I have weakened or understated it For myself I declare that I am not able to conceive how it can be expressed in stronger terms against the parties accused If nevertheless it should be contended that the terms I have made use of are loose or defective or that I have not done perfect justice to Sir Elijah Impey's meaning and intention let it be remembered Sir that he has not delivered his accusation in writing as I had a strict unquestionable right to expect Nothing  that may be urged to justify his withholding the remainder of his defence can be applied to that part of it in which others are accused It might be very prudent in him it might be essential to his safety not to put his accusers in possession of his defence Be it so In that respect he is at liberty to act as he thinks proper though I believe his refusal to produce his defence in the only form in which it could be fairly canvassed or even compared with the written accusation will not be received as a strong presumptive proof even of his own confidence in the merits of his cause My demand is a demand of right It is not to oblige him to produce his defence but to produce his accusation Before I proceed Sir to the refutation of the charge as I have stated it the exactness of which I perceive is not disputed I must call the attention of the Committee to two preliminary considerations and request that gentlemen will carry them in their minds during the subsequent discussion They will throw a light on the general question and I believe be found very material to a thorough understanding of the whole transaction I mean simply to state them now and to reserve the application of them for  another part of my defenceThe first relates to the manner in which the paper in question came into Sir Elijah Impey's hands the difficulties which were to be surmounted before he could be in possession of it and the probable truth or falsehood of his assertion that he never knew what the charges were which Nundcomar had produced against Mr Hastings I shall recapitulate the facts to you briefly as they appear on the records or as they have been stated by Sir Elijah Impey  The Rajah Nundcomar was executed on the th of August On the th General Clavering brought the petition which was afterwards burnt before the Governor General and Council in their secret department It was produced and read but I conclude that the translation which the General brought with him was not relied on because I find the next secret consultation of the th begins with the following words  Vide Bengal Appendix page    "The Persian translator sends in a  corrected  translation of the petition of the late Maha Raja Nundcomar delivered in by General Clavering"  Mr Hastings immediately moved that  "as this  petition contained expressions reflecting upon the characters of the chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court a copy of it might be sent them"  I objected to that proposal and moved that orders should be given to the Sheriff to cause the original to be burned publicly by the hands of the common hangmana singular step Sir and on the face of our proceedings utterly unaccountable Mr Hastings repeatedly said that he did not object to that motion but he observed that it would not be effectual  "as the petition stood on our own records through which it would find its way to the Court of Directors to his Majesty's Ministers and in all probability become public to the whole people of Britain"  Admitting the force of the observation I proposed that  the entry of the address from Rajah Nundcomar should be expunged  On this motion the  unanimous  resolution of the board stands in the following wordsAGREED  that it be expunged accordingly and that the translations be destroyed  To this resolution Mr Hastings was a party not only as a Member of the Council legally bound and concluded by the sense of the majority but by his own express consent and agreement  On the th of August the Judges wrote to us in the following words  Page    "A paper containing a false scandalous and malicious charge against the Judges of the Supreme Court produced at your Board having been by you declared a libel and ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman we return you our thanks for having shewn so due a sense of this outrage to public justice but as we must be interested as well in the Minutes introducing and condemning the paper as in the paper itself we find ourselves obliged to desire that you will furnish us with a copy of the libel and of such Minutes which relate to it as stand on your consultations and must therefore be conveyed to England that we may judge whether they contain any matters NECESSARY FOR US TO TAKE NOTICE OF"  In our reply dated th September we said  Page    "We shall be much obliged to you if you will be pleased to acquaint us from whom you received the imperfect information  which appears to have been conveyed to you on this and other occasions of the proceedings of this Board in our secret department such communications cannot regularly be made to you but by the authority of the Board nor can they be obtained without a breach of trust in some of our officers which we are persuaded you would not encourage  "We do not think ourselves at liberty to communicate to you the Minutes which may have passed on the present subject as such Minutes are drawn up solely for the information of our superiors With respect to the libel it is not possible for us to furnish you with a copy of that paper having ordered the original and translations to be destroyed  and no copy to be kept of either  "  This letter you will observe was signed by Mr Hastings who knew that he alone had given the informationwho had agreed to the resolution of the Board that the original paper and translations should be destroyed and that no copy should be kept of eitherwho nevertheless kept a copy of the translation which he must have obtained from the Persian translator by a breach of duty in that officer who  knew that he had given or intended to give a copy of that translation to Sir Elijah Impey and who not only did so but as it now appears altered the translation made by the proper officer of government in many places with his own hand and it is by this last extraordinary circumstance that Sir Elijah Impey proves the authenticity of the paper which he produces in his defence namely that it is altered corrected and interlined in Mr Hastings's handwriting Mr Hastings I know did not agree to the letter though he signed it his dissent is recorded in the following words  "I disapprove of the draught because I do not think the information imperfect which was received by the Judges because it appears to me an inconsistency to speak of a paper which was expunged from the records and ordered to be publicly burnt by the common hangman as a secret of state which it was a breach of trust to divulge and because the letter is written  in a strain of insinuation  equally unbecoming the dignity of the Board and deficient in the respect which is due to the Judges of the Court to whom it is addressed"  This dissent you see is supported by every argument he could think of except the true one He does not tell us that he himself had given the information that he himself had kept a copy of the translation that he himself had corrected and given it to Sir Elijah Impey Had he assigned the true reason for his dissent we must have given a very different answer to the Judges It would have been impossible even for  us  to sign such a letter as that which we all signed much less could we have desired or expected Mr Hastings to put his name to it It may be said perhaps that he was bound by a provision in the Act of Parliament and by the forms of the Council to sign a letter resolved on by the majority even against his opinion That he was legally so bound and concluded I admit but that in fact he submitted to the law I deny On other occasions it appears that he did not hold himself bound by any obligation whatever legal or formal to sign a letter of which he disapproved  On the th of the preceding June the majority resolved on a letter to the Judges to which Mr Hastings did not agree Did he sign it with a dissent Nothe records says page  "The Governor General and Mr Barwell disapproving of this reply decline affixing their names to it for which they will assign their reasons in a Minute"  On the th of June they refused to sign another letter to the Judges which was accordingly sent without their signature and Mr Hastings said he thought himself justified in that refusal  both by the letter of the law and the spirit of the Company's orders  page    The studied terms of evasion in which Sir Elijah Impey declined answering our requisition deserve your attention but they require no comment He says  Page    "Our letter mentions no information we had received from your Board we cannot see what reason you have to suppose we have received any We shall at all times be ready to give you any information and assistance in our power in forwarding the public business but must decline making a precedent of submitting to answer questions which we think not intended for the benefit of the service and which you have neither grounds nor right to put to us"  Signed "E IMPEY JOHN HYDE"  Sir Elijah Impey tells you on another occasion and to serve another material purpose that he knew nothing of the contents of the charges of Nundcomar against Mr Hastings His words as I wrote them down upon the instant were  "I aver that I did not know what they were How should I They were produced before a secret Council and examined by a secret Committee of which all the members their clerks and secretaries were  sworn to secrecy  "  Now Sir admitting it to be possible that Sir Elijah Impey might not know from public report the specific sums stated or the particular facts and circumstances charged by Nundcomar against Mr Hastings that admission will not avail him You are called upon to believe that Sir Elijah Impey living in the closest connection and intimacy with Mr Hastings did not know what was known to every man in Calcutta what was the universal subject of conversation there for many months together namely that Nundcomar had accused Mr Hastings of venality and corruption in his office He did not know that this charge was laid before the Council on the th of March that Nundcomar had been examined before the Council  that on the th of April Nundcomar was summoned to appear before all the Judges to answer to a charge of a conspiracy against Mr Hastings and that having been acquitted and dismissed on that examination he was on the th of May arrested and committed to the common jail by a warrant signed by two of the Judges upon a charge of forgery The facts at least were too public and too notorious not to be known to him But we are to believe that knowing such facts it never once occurred to him that there could be any relation between the first and all that followed it Being ignorant as he assures you of the particulars of the charge against Mr Hastings he never once suspected that that act of Nundcomar could have been the motive of those subsequent measures which were taken to destroy him Any other man I think would have combined the circumstances In any other human mind they must have excited some degree of suspicion My Honourable Friend I doubt not will be able to satisfy this House in proper time that the general fact namely that Nundcomar had brought a criminal charge against Mr Hasting and even the special nature of that charge were  judicially known to Sir Elijah Impey long before the execution What I contend for and insist upon now is that it is a thing utterly incredible that it is a belief to which no human credulity can extend that Mr Hastings who in the face of the most sacred obligation and engagement thought himself at liberty to communicate to Sir Elijah Impey the petition of Nundcomar to give him a corrected translation of it and to furnish him as I shall prove he did with copies of our Minutes directly arraigning the conduct of Sir Elijah Impey in the trial and execution of Nundcomar should not have imparted to him the charges preferred against himself by Nundcomar which though entered in the secret department were neither of a secret nature in themselves nor in fact a secret to any man in Calcutta  The second preliminary observation which I wish to impress on the minds of the Committee regards the distinction which Sir Elijah Impey carefully makes and strenuously insists on between the paper itself and our  Minutes  upon the subjectthe first he saw the second he never saw till very lately when he obtained a copy of them from the India House  It is indeed not only material but essential to his defence that he should persuade you of the truth of this last assertion He well knew though you are not aware of it that if he admitted that he had seen our Minutes of the th of August at any time before January he must have convicted himself of the grossest falsehood and contradiction I shall speak to that point presently But it seems that he not only did not see them in the year but that he never saw them a tall  till very lately  Now Sir I beg leave in the first place to observe that the Minutes in question on the present production of which he professes to place so much reliance have not been concealed from the world have not been buried in obscurity The books now before me called the Bengal Narrative and Appendix must have been printed by the Court of Directors in the year or I presume so because I had a copy of them long before I left Bengal in the course of the year if not sooner There were other copies in Calcutta They were read with avidity by every man in the settlement who could procure a sight of them They contain not only our Minutes but great  part of our proceedings and all our correspondence with Sir Elijah Impey on the subject of Nundcomar To all other men the contents must have been an object of curiosity at least I know they were so To  him  in particular they were in the highest degree interesting and important Yet the learned gentleman never saw them in Bengal these books it seems  never  fell into his hands nay you are to be believe that among the number of persons by whom they were unquestionably perused he had no acquaintance who might have told him that such a compilation published by authority and in which his name and conduct were so often mentioned existed in Calcutta He had no friend or wellwisher among that number who might have waited on him as soon as he had read our Minutes to congratulate him on the testimony given as you are told by his enemies or opponents in favour of his integrity and to recommend those passages at least to his immediate perusal Believe it if you will believe it if you can Perhaps you may think that having gone so far you have done enough and that Sir Elijah Impey has no farther demand on your credulity That learned gentleman  is not so easily satisfied It seems Sir he knew the facts he knew that we had ordered a libel on the Supreme Court of Judicature to be burned and that it was burned he had seen the paper itself and was in possession of a copy of it given him by Mr Hastings but he had never  never  seen the Minutes that related to it Now Sir it is of itself an extraordinary circumstance that Mr Hastings who thought himself at liberty to give him the paper in violation as I think of the laws of the Council and of his own personal agreement should not have communicated to him those Minutes which make an essential part of the transaction and which if they were then supposed to mean what he tells you they so clearly express were not only innocent of all offence to the Judges but conveyed a positive approbation of their conduct Why should Mr Hastings make so partial a communication of our proceedings to Sir Elijah ImpeyWhy should the Governor General withhold from the Chief Justice the fair and reasonable satisfaction of knowing that we his enemies had borne testimony to the rectitude of his conduct and vindicated his character from every aspersion which might have  been or could be thrown upon it I defy any man to state a principle of action that will justify Mr Hastings in doing the first and not doing the second or a rational motive of any kind to make it probable in fact that he did the one and not the other The assertion is that Mr Hastings did not communicate our Minutes on this occasion to Sir Elijah Impey Why notperhaps he thought it unfairperhaps he thought it would have been a breach of trust and honour to his colleaguesPerhaps he made a distinction between the paper itself which as he says  having been ordered to be publickly burnt could be no secret of state  Page  and the Minutes of the Council given in secret debate and recorded for the sole information of the Court of Directors In general there might have been something though in this case there would have been nothing in the distinctionbut in fact did he make the distinction I appeal to Sir Elijah Impey and shall leave it to him to answer the question In his letter of the th of January in four or five months after the transaction of which we are speaking he tells the Secretary of State  "The Governor General has within  these few days communicated to me several Minutes signed by General Clavering Colonel Monson and Mr Francis they are severally fraught with direct charges or plain insinuations against the characters of the Judges and the conduct of the Court of Judicature Some seem more particularly levelled at  me  "  You have it then from unquestionable authority that Mr Hastings did communicate our Minutes to Sir Elijah Impey Minutes fraught with direct charges against himMinutes which as he  Impey  says  were intended to be kept secret but the Governor General had at last thought that they ought in justice to be communicated to him  Did he so Then where was the justice of Mr Hastings when he communicated to his learned friend those secret Minutes of ours which were fraught with charges against him and did not communicate to him those other Minutes in which as this learned gentleman tells you we had expressed a direct unequivocal approbation of his conduct was it a fair and honourable proceeding to his colleagues would it have been common justice even to his enemies to impart the one and not the other to the person who was the subject of both to impart to Sir Elijah  Impey every thing that was likely to inflame him against us and to withhold from his knowledge what might have operated in his mind as an antidote against that poison namely the strong declarations which we are stated to have made in his favour was it just to Sir E I to discover to him the charges which we had written home against him and not to furnish him with that clear complete and irresistible answer which had escaped or been extorted from us by which the charges might not only have been refuted but must have been annihilated I mean the direct testimony and confession of his accusers For my part Sir I acquit Mr Hastings of acting so unjustly to all parties to his friend as well as to his foes I acquit him of it because I am not able to conceive a reason good or bad why he should act in a manner at once so unfair to his colleagues and so injurious to his friend I have no doubt that he communicated  all  our Minutes to Sir Elijah Impey In proper time I shall shew you for what reason the contrary is maintained by this learned gentleman On this part of the subject I shall trouble you with only one observation more The Judges in their letter of the th of August  transmitted to us certain petitions  Sir Elijah Impey has lived to alter his opinion of Petitions In his letter to Lord Weymouth of the nd of March he says  "the only manner in which the obtaining Petitions here differs from the modes practised by factions in England isthere they are solicited and got by influencehere they are commanded"  which had been addressed to them in order that they might stand recorded  Page  on our consultations  "which" they say "we think peculiarly proper at this time as by promulgating the universal sense of this settlement in relation to our conduct they are a direct and public refutation of the libel and corroborate  such  of your Minutes as tend to vindicate our reputations"  Now Sir if he had not seen our secret consultations of the th of August how came he to know that those or any other Minutes existed How could he make the distinction between such as did and such as did not tend to vindicate his reputation Mine was the only Minute of the three to which by any possible construction that tendency could be imputed Is it not evident from this passage alone that he had a copy of the consultation before him or what  is in effect the same that the substance of our different Minutes had been distinctly stated to himFrom all the premises taken together I draw this immediate inference of fact which as I conceive it is impossible for the human mind to resist and which for other reasons I know to be true namely that while he pretended  to be scrupulously neuter in the disputes which agitated the Council  he was secretly leagued in early connexion in close communication in deep alliance and confederacy with Mr Hastings In what sense that fact is material to my defence and in what manner I mean to apply it will soon appear  I must now request the Committee to observe that there are two parties concerned in the accusation brought against us by Sir Elijah Impeyone the then majority of the Council collectively viz General Clavering Colonel Monson and myselfthe other Sir John Clavering alone Our causes are distinct and must be separately considered and defended With respect to the former of these parties I have already stated to you the recorded facts of the transaction in the order in which they happened I am now to state the reasons of  our conduct I mean not only our avowed but our reserved reasons for acting as we did  In reply to the Governor's motion I said  Page  that  "I thought our sending a copy of the Raja Nundcomar's address to our Board to the Chief Justice and the Judges would be giving it much more weight than it deserved and that I considered the insinuations contained in it against them as wholly unsupported and of a libellous nature"  In the whole of that opinion Colonel Monson agreed but he added  "that if the Board should communicate the paper to the Judges he thought  they  the Members of the Board might be liable to a prosecution for a libel"  General Claveringdisapproved of the proposition  "because he thought it might make the Members of the Board who sent it liable to a prosecution"  The Governor General and Council having unanimously agreed that the Persian paper should be publicly destroyed I concluded the debate with another motion in the following words  Page    "By the same channel through which the Court of Directors and his Majesty's Ministers and the nation might be informed of the contents of the paper  in question they must also be informed of the reception it had met with and the sentence passed upon it at this Board I therefore hope that its being destroyed in the manner proposed will be sufficient to clear the character of the Judges  so far as they appear to be attacked in that paper  and to prevent any possibility of the imputations indirectly thrown on the Judges from extending beyond this Board I move that the entry of the address from Rajah Nundcomar entered on our proceedings of Monday last be expunged"  Before I offer any observation on the true intent and meaning of these Minutes allow me to read to you a few short passages out of other Minutes of ours written both before and after the execution of Nundcomar in which our opinion of the real principle and purpose of that proceeding is very strongly and very explicitly declared  "Minute of Mr  FRANCIS  April    Page    "I beg leave to observe that a prosecution for a conspiracy is now instituted or is intended  to be instituted against Maha Rajah Nundcomar and others the tendency of which seems to me to be to prevent or deter him from proceeding in making good those discoveries which he has laid before the Board I cannot but think that the East India Company and consequently this Board have a very great concern in every step taken in that prosecution whether it be actually begun or intended"  Minute of  GENERAL CLAVERING  th May    Page    "In reply to what the Governor General has just said I conceive that the protection of the inhabitants of Bengal is immediately trusted to our care and that it properly belongs to us to represent to the Judges such matters as may appear to us wherein they have acted improperly either wilfully or ignorantly In the present instance they probably are ignorant how much a close confinement may endanger the life of this man which is of so much importance to the public for proving an accusation which he has made of  venality  in the Governor General"  Extract of a Minute of  CLAVERING MONSON  and  FRANCIS  Sept    "After the death of Nundcomar the Governor we believe is well assured that no man who regards his safety will venture to stand forth as his accuser  "On a subject of this delicate nature it becomes us to leave every honest man to his own reflexions It ought to be made known however to the English nation that the forgery of which the Raja was accused must have been committed several years ago that in the interim he had been protected and employed by Mr Hastings that his son was appointed to one of the first offices in the Nabob's household with a salary of one lack of rupees that the accusation which ended in his destruction was not produced till he came forward and brought a specific charge against the Governor General of corruption in his office"  Ditto of ditto  "We agree with Mr Hastings that not only he himself but many other persons in  this settlement have reason to thank God as he expresses it for the institution of this Court"  Ditto  dated Nov    "It seems probable such embezzlements may have been universally practised In the present circumstances it will be difficult if not impracticable to obtain direct proof of the facts The terror impressed on the minds of the natives by the execution of Maha Rajah Nundcomar is not to be effaced for though he suffered for the crime of forgery yet the natives conceive he was executed for having dared to prefer complaints against the Governor General  "This idea however destitute of foundation is prevalent among the natives and will naturally deter them from making discoveries which may be attended with the same fatal consequences to themselves  "Punishment is usually intended as an example to prevent the commission of crimes in this instance we fear it has served to prevent the discovery of them"  Ditto  March    "Some of the facts with which he Mr Hastings has been personally charged have been proved The presumptive evidence in support of the rest will we apprehend lose none of its force by the precipitate removal of Maha Rajah Nundcomar"  Now Sir if it be true that there is a manifest inconsistency a palpable contradiction between these declarations and our intermediate proceedings on the th August I have brought that inconsistency and contradiction plainly and distinctly into your view I am sure I can satisfy the Committee that it does not exist In the first place you will allow me to say that setting aside all consideration of moral character and claiming nothing in favour of General Clavering Colonel Monson and myself but that we shall not be taken for idiots it is not very likely that having repeatedly charged the prosecution and execution of Nundcomar against Sir Elijah Impey as a political measure of the most atrocious kind having so often recorded that opinion on the proceedings of the Council we should almost at the same moment voluntarily and  without any apparent reason deliberately contradict ourselves and record our own condemnation on the face of our proceedings Is it a thing to be believed that having advanced  such  a charge we should so lightly abandon it and that having abandoned we should resume and reassert it without once attempting to reconcile or explain the inconsistency of our conduct if the idea of that contradiction which is now urged and insisted on had ever occurred to us Is it likely that while we were contending with Mr Hastings for the good opinion of the Court of Directors we should have placed ourselves before them in a point of view which must have utterly annihilated their confidence in usSir I affirm that in fact we did no such thing The terms of  my  opinion of the contents of the paper which I proposed should be destroyed are I see particularly relied on I desire they may be strictly examined I said that to send to the Judges a copy of Nundcomar's petition would be giving it much more weight than it deserved that I considered the insinuations contained in it against them as wholly unsupported and of a libellous nature I thought and said so then I think and say so still in  the extent and manner in which they were stated in that paper The person in whose name it appeared was dead He had whether justly or unjustly legally or illegally been convicted of a crime and had suffered an ignominious death Even if he had been respited after conviction his evidence would have been useless for his credit was gone A petition from such a person accusing his Judges could have no sort of weight It came before us without a responsible accuser without a proof or evidence of any kind I therefore said it was  wholly unsupported  No man I presume will deny that it was in strictness of  a libellous nature  I asserted then as I assert now that it was a libel on the whole Court of Justice in the strict and proper sense of the word The dreadful charge contained in it included  all  the Judges concerning two of whom Sir Robert Chambers and Mr Hyde we never had a suspicion of the motives which we attributed to Sir Elijah Impey though I am far from acquitting them of all blame Concerning another of the Judges the late Mr Lemaistre though we saw him united in the closest intimacy with the Chief Justice and ready to support his opinions on all occasions  with a degree of zeal and passion which however sincere was not to be excused yet in that which constitutes the deadly guilt of the transaction we never suspected him to be concernedin a confederacy I mean with Sir Elijah Impey to take off Nundcomar in order to save Mr Hastings from the effect of that man's evidence We were bound therefore to treat the petition as an indiscriminate libel against a whole Court of Justice Is there any thing in that resolution or in the terms of my opinion on which it was founded that under any I will not say fair and liberal but under the most rigorous construction can be understood to express or signify that we thought the paper  false  as well as libellous of all the Judges This is no new distinction set up by me to serve the present purpose It is no after thought no  ex post facto  vindication of my conduct I can prove to the Committee that I always made the same distinction between an accusation and a libel When Mr Hastings accused me personally about three months before of presenting a libel against him to the Board my answer to him stands recorded in the following words  Extract of a Minute of Mr  FRANCIS  March    "The Governor General who had long expected the appearance of such a letter and was apprised of the contents of it made no objection however to its being received and read at the Board When the man who advances a specific charge declares himself ready to come forward and support it and to hazard the consequences of failing in his proofs it may still indeed be presumed that the charge is false but it does not partake of the nature of a libel A libeller advances charges which he does not intend or is unable to make good When called upon to appear and produce his evidence he shelters himself sometimes in the obscurity sometimes in the superiority of his situation and leaves the accusation without an accuser to operate as far as it can in the opinions of men against the honour and reputation of the party accused Rajah Nundcomar is not an obscure person in this country nor does he in this instance act the part of a libeller He is himself of very high rank he publickly accuses the Governor  General of misconduct in his office and desires to be heard in person in support of his charge"  This is my defence against the charge as it affects us collectively on the face of our proceedings and I willingly submit to your judgment whether the avowed ostensible reasons publicly assigned by me be not sufficient to account for my public official conduct on the occasion and to acquit me of the present charge of contradiction But had I no other motives for what I did beyond those which I have assigned Undoubtedly I had and I am ready to declare them Addressing you as I do under an honourable and moral obligation as powerful and coercive as any that law or religion can impose upon the human mind I should hold myself a perjured man if called upon as in effect I am for the whole truth I reserved any part of it from your knowledge My secret predominant motive for proposing to destroy the original paper produced by General Clavering was to save  him  and  him  alone from the danger to which he had exposed himself by that rash inconsiderate action Yet the step I took was not immediately taken on  my own suggestion As soon as Mr Hastings proposed that a copy of the paper should be sent to the Judgesa step suspicious on the face of it and by which it was impossible any good purpose could be answeredColonel Monson started at it and desired me to go with him into another room Possibly Mr Barwell may recollect the circumstance He then said  "I suppose you see what the Governor means If the Judges get possession of the paper Clavering may be ruined by it"  My answer was  "Why what can they do to him"  To that he replied  "I know not what they can do but since they have dipped their hands in blood what is there they will not do"  He then desired me to move that the original paper should be destroyed by the hands of the common hangman This short conversation passed very nearly I firmly believe if not precisely in the terms in which I have related it It is not possible I should ever forget or mistake the substance of it If I am charged with having acted a feeble pusillanimous part let it be remembered that my fears whether well or ill founded were not for myself that the danger whether real or imaginary could  no way extend to  me  To fear nothing when we ourselves are in no danger is not an unquestionable proof of resolutionmuch less is it a proof of timidity to fear every thing for the safety of a friend It was my opinion however and is so at this hour that the danger to General Clavering was real and serious The author of the libel was dead General Clavering had made himself the publisher and put himself into the power of his enemies I cannot bring before you in evidence the state of the settlement at that time the great power that was confederated against us and the universal combination of all ranks of Europeans to support that power in all its operations We were sent out by Parliament to enquire into and to reform abuses The first discoveries that came before us gave a general alarm The cause of Mr Hastings was made and declared to be the common cause and interest of all the Company's servants We on the contrary were considered as their common enemy and were at once the object of their jealousy their fear and detestation With a very few exceptions we three in effect stood alone against the combined power of two Members of the Council one of whom was the Governor General  against the Supreme Court of Judicature against the Board of Trade and against the united animosity and clamour of the whole settlement If in that state and temper of the times General Clavering had been indicted for a libel on the Supreme Court whose powers were in effect to us undefined unlimited and subject to nocontroul  Sir Elijah Impey in his letter of the th of May Page says  "The bounds between the authority of the Supreme Court and the Council are of too delicate a nature to be discussed without there should be which I trust there never will be an absolute necessity to determine them"  I cannot positively affirm what would have been the consequence but I am positively sure that no efforts would have been spared no methods unattempted to harass and distress him and if possible accomplish his ruin This I declare upon my honour and am ready to declare upon my oath was  my  motive as I am convinced it was that of Colonel Monson for insisting that the original paper should be destroyed I do not expect that the force of this motive should be felt in this place and at the present hour as it was by  us  upon the spot and in the moment of action  The period is too remote The scene is too distant The instant impression upon  our  minds cannot easily be communicated to yours We knew we were surrounded by the snares of the law We had no legal learning We had no legal advice You may speculate coolly and wisely upon our conduct but you will not determine equitably if you do not endeavour to place yourselves exactly in our situation At all events whether we did right or wrong we certainly did not do that of which we are accused We never said that the contents of Nundcomar's petition were not true As Mr Hastings entirely agreed with us in every thing we did I never had a doubt that the translation was destroyed until Sir Elijah Impey produced a copy of it at the bar of this House Of the authenticity of this translation you have no other evidence but that which confesses it was obtained by means the most unjustifiable by means which prove what we always suspected that we were betrayed by one of our own Board to Sir Elijah Impey and by means which prove to demonstration the collusion and confederacy that subsisted from the first between Sir Elijah Impey and Mr Hastings The existence of  that wellgrounded suspicion is material to our defence  I am now to reply to that part of Sir Elijah Impey's accusation which exclusively affects General Clavering On my own account personally I have no manner of concern in it I am here the uninstructed advocate the feeble defendant of an honourable friend who is now no more In  his  name and for his cause I claim and expect that indulgence that favour and protection which he I am sure would never have solicited for himself but which is admitted to be due and which this House in fact has liberally distributed to other defendants The learned gentleman himself when he appeared at your bar was received there as he ought to be with favour and indulgence He was received there with what I believe is not quite so common though perhaps equally proper with distinguished marks of protection But if indulgence if favour and protection are due to a person who is present to defend himself who is himself a man of great learning and experience and who can at any time collect and command the united learning of his profession and summon it to his assistance how much more are they due to a man  of great character who is not here to plead his own cause who is not only absent but dead and who died in the service of his country Not indeed in the field of battle where his gallant mind would have led him but in a vile vexatious contest with menI will not attempt to qualify themGeneral Clavering thought himself degraded by a contest with such men  In this transaction I cannot undertake to answer for all the motions of his conduct I think I can for some of them But assuredly Sir I shall not attempt to explain what I never understood that is with what intention and for what possible purpose he brought the paper before the Board Neither is that question material at present The questionable words in his Minute of the th of August when he produced the Petition of Nundcomar are these  "As I imagined that the Paper might contain some request that I should take some steps to intercede for him and being resolved not to make any applications whatever in his favour I left the Paper on my table till the th which was the day after his execution when I ordered it to be translated by my interpreter"  On this proceeding the question is  too obvious not to occur instantly to every man who hears me  why had he resolved not to make any application whatever in favour of Nundcomar  In attempting to account for an act done by another so many years ago and to verify the motives of the person who did it you will not expect that the evidence should amount to demonstration The best that I can offer you and the utmost the case will admit of is strong probability and fair conjecture The peculiar character and known principles of General Clavering must be taken into the account Remember that you are trying a cause of honour in a Court of Honour in the  forum conscientiae  which exists in the heart of every honourable man not in a Court of Law You cannot fairly pronounce upon the man without knowing and considering the general principles of his life Now Sir I affirm of General Clavering what I believe will not be disputed by any person who knew him that his moral mind and character were strictly and severely upright that he determined every question that came before him with rigid justice that his delicacy in every thing that appeared to him to touch his honour was more than scrupulous and bordered if possible  upon excess I have sometimes told him so when I have seen him refuse little complimentary presents of fruit or flowers sent to his family and order them to be returnedHe was a man very tender of public reputation very fearful of reproach and particularly fearful of the imputation of supporting and encouraging the accuser of Mr Hastings With these principles he might possibly think that it did not become him to intercede for a man found guilty of a capital offence But it is much more probable and more material to his present vindication that he was well convinced his intercession would do mischief instead of good and would rather hasten than retard the execution of Nundcomar Mr Farrer tells you in his evidence  Page  that when he proposed to the General to receive and transmit to the Judges a Petition of Nundcomar addressed to the Governor General and Council his answer ended with these words  "nor indeed did he think it would do any good"  That he had solid and sufficient reason for entertaining that opinion I believe I can demonstrate Many gentlemen I dare say who heard Sir Elijah Impey's fugitive defence  at the Bar went away with an impression that General Clavering Colonel Monson and I never took any formal steps in favour of Nundcomar and that if we had interceded for him it might probably have saved his life Whether the Judges would or would not have yielded to our intercession is a question which no human tribunal can decide You may form a judgment of it however by observing how the Court acted when we really did intercede with them in favour of Nundcomar in instances of no importance to the real purposes of justice though very important to the unfortunate man himself I shall state the facts I allude to in the terms in which they are recorded  On the th of May  Page  a Petition was received from Rajah Nundcomar to the Governor General and Council which after stating many other particulars very deserving of the attention of the House of Commons concludes with the following words  "The Honourable President I am well assured is fully sensible of the facts I allude toIt may be requisite to explain to the rest of the Honourable Members of the  Board that the institutions of our religion strictly enjoin a number of ablutions prayers and other ceremonies to be performed by the sect of Bramins before they can take any kind of food Nothing of this can be performed in the place where I now am and could even these obstacles be surmounted the place itself as being inhabited by men of a different religion would prevent my receiving any sustenance without breaking those rules which I have hitherto religiously observed I therefore humbly request that I may be permitted to reside under as strict a guard as may be judged requisite in some place where these objections may be obviated"  After a long and careful examination made by the Board into the truth of this representation I moved  Page    "That the Sheriff and his Deputy should be directed to wait on the Chief Justice on the part of the Board to represent to him the situation of the Rajah Nundcomar whose religion as he had informed the Board had obliged him to deny himself sustenance in the particular circumstances of his present confinement  and to desire the Chief Justice would consider of granting the Prisoner such relief as might be consistent with the strict security of his person to answer to the charges brought against him and that a copy of the latter part of the Rajah's Petion to the Board should be delivered to the Sheriff"  Colonel Monson and General Clavering agreed  The Governor General said  "I object to the Motion because the same representation may be made by the Prisoner himself to the Chief Justice and I think therefore it would be improper that it should be conveyed to him through the authority of Government"  In reply to this message Sir Elijah Impey in his letter of the th of May thought proper to say  Page    "I must make it my request that the Maha Rajah may be acquainted by the Board that if he has any further application to make for relief he must address himself immediately to the Judges who will give all due attention to his representations for should he continue to address himself to the Board that which  will and can only be obtained from principles of justice may have the appearance of being obtained by the means of influence and authority the peculiar turn of mind of the natives being to expect every thing from power and little from justice"  In another letter dated May he says  Page    "I did not nor do not question the authority of the Board in receiving Petitions I carefully restricted what I said  to this individual Prisoner  I did not desire his Petitions should not be received but when received if they were to require any thing from the Judges or the Court that the answers given to those Petitions should be that he must apply himself directly to the Judges and this I did to avoid the imputation I then alluded to and which would be equally derogatory to the character of the Council as that of the Judges  "The particular reason which called upon me in this case to make that requisition was the reports publicly circulated in this town that if the Judges could not be prevailed  upon to release the Maha Rajah he he would be delivered by force"  This supposed report of an intention in the Commander in Chief and two of the Council to release the Prisoner  manu forti  was not inconsiderately advanced or abandoned by the learned Gentleman After we had forced him to declare as he did in his letter to the Board of the th of May  Page    "That he knew it to be totally groundless that he again and again disclaimed ever having given any credit and detested the thought of adding weight to so scandalous a report"  he revived it in his letter to the Secretary of State of the th of January in the following words  "It should be known that the conduct of the Council  meaning the majority  to the Judges and to the Prisoner during his confinement had raised an almost universal belief in the Natives and even among the Europeans that the Prisoner would be  protected from justice  in defiance of the Court"  And now he resumes and insists upon it once more at the Bar of this House I leave it to him to reconcile an imputation of such a nature if he can to that high approbation with which he says  we afterwards received the execution of Nundcomar But in what light did General Clavering consider it Sir the imputation of a design to resist the Civil Power to oppose the Execution of Justice appeared to him not only so scandalous but so dangerous so particularly levelled at  him  as a Military Man as Commander in Chief of the Army that he thought it necessary for his safety to exculpate himself from it by oath  Page  I say  for his safety  because I am firmly of opinion that he would have been in as great danger as Nundcomar if the Judges could have found any thing criminal to have laid to his charge Colonel Monson and I though not the immediate objects of that infamous calumny thought it right to take the same oath From this extraordinary fact I leave it to you to conclude what must have been our opinion of the personal security of our situation  On the th of May the Chief Justice thought fit to write us a very long letter on the subject of our interposition in behalf of Nundcomar in which he said  Page    "As to communicating Petitions to the the Judges I apprehend that no Board even of the highest authority in England can refer any matter either to a Court of Justice or any Judge thereof otherwise than by suit legally instituted"  On the d of June  Page  the Chief Justice declared from the Bench that the Governor General and Council whom he considered as nothing more than as Agents of the East India Company could only apply to the Court by humble Petition and that the Court could not receive in future any letters or messages but in that form  Extract of a Declaration from the Bench made by Sir  ELIJAH IMPEY  on  the    d of June    "The Company as well as all other Appellants must not claim it but prefer an humble Petition This being thus explained to prevent any further altercations of this nature the Court must inform the Board that they cannot respect being had  to the dignity of his Majesty's Courts and to the welfare of the country receive in future any letter or messages but in that form"  On the th of June  Page  we transmitted to the Judges a translation of a letter addressed to the Governor General and Council in favour of Nundcomar by the Nabob Mobaric ul Dowlah Subadar of the Provinces of Bengal Bahar and Orixa titular indeed for to that state was he reduced but the only rightful representative of the Sovereignty and still acknowledged to be the Nazim or Chief Criminal Magistrate of the country Whether the Judges gave any answer to that specific application from the Nabob through the Governor General and Council I cannot discover I rather suspect that as Sir Elijah Impey knew the reference had passed  unanimously  at the Board he thought it best to take no notice of what he could not conveniently condemn without a censure of his friends But observe how he acted when he found us alone On the th of June the  Governor General and Council had resolved to address the Judges in behalf of the Nabob's Vakeel for whom we claimed as well on the part of the Prince whom he represented as on the part of our Government by whom he was received the rights and privileges of a public Minister  Page  Mr Hastings and Mr Barwell dissented and refused to sign the letter I beg leave to read to you an extract from the answer which the Judges sent us the next day by a Master in Chancery  Page    "That the Court is of opinion that all claims of individuals ought to be made directly to the Court by the individuals and not by the authority of the Governor General and Council  "That it is contrary to the principles of the English Constitution for any person or persons to address a Court of Justice by letter missive concerning any matter pending before such Court and that the higher the station of the person or persons so addressing the act is the more unconstitutional"  Finally Sir I beg leave to read to you an extract of what is called  Page  the unanimous opinion of the Court delivered on the    st of July by the Chief Justice in consequence of a letter signed J ClaveringGeorge MonsonP Francis  "It is with the deepest concern we find the Council still persist to address the Court by letter on subjects pending in Court or on which the Court have given their opinion and that notwithstanding the frequent declarations and unanimous opinion of the Court upon the impropriety of that mode of address"  After all this had passed it is not much to be wondered at that General Clavering should resolve not to make any more applications in favour of Nundcomar  You have seen that we interceded for him with the Judges You have seen in what manner our intercession was received It is proper you should know what the subject and occasion were which drew down so many censures and menaces upon us As soon as we received Nundcomar's petition of the th of May the conclusion and prayer of which  we immediately resolved to communicate to Sir Elijah Impey we examined the Sheriff and Under Sheriff concerning the circumstances of Nundcomar's confinement and of his situation in the goal From their evidence it appeared that he was committed on the th and from that time I think about forty hours had refused to take any sustenance The next day the Chief Justice's answer to our message was received in Council  He desired the Sheriff and Under Sheriff to inform us  "that Rajah Nundcomar was not committed by him and that he had no authority to interfere in the affair there being felony expressly charged in the warrant"  General Clavering then said  Page    "I acquaint the Board that I have received a letter from Mr Joseph Fowke who is just come from visiting Maha Raja Nundcomar acquainting me that it is the opinion of the people who were about him that they do not think he can live another day without drink He says his tongue is much parched but that his spirit is firm In the  conversation that he had with the Raja the Raja told him  do not trouble yourself about me The will of heaven must be complied with I am innocent  "  I immediately moved that the goaler might be sent for to inform us whether Rajah Nundcomar had really taken no sustenance since his confinement and in what situation the Raja then was When he came I questioned him myself and it appeared by his examination that the Rajah had then taken no sustenance for sixtythree hoursthat the jail was crowded that it had not been so full before and that there were at that time twentythree felons in it besides other prisoners I then moved  "that the information laid before the Board by General Clavering and the further account given by the jailer should be communicated to the Chief Justice by the Secretary on the part of the Board and that the Secretary should wait upon him accordingly as soon as the Board broke up"  This was agreed to and ordered  On the same day we received a letter from Sir Elijah Impey to inform us that he had sent for the pundits and examined them concerning the pretended scruples of Nundcomar The result was  that there were no grounds for  altering the mode of confinement of the Maha Raja  He assured us  Page    "that the Judges would as far as by law they might remit the rigour of the English law in all cases where its effects might be prejudicial to the natives on account of their religion and perhaps in some cases would yield even to prejudices if national and deep rooted But they must not suffer the pretence of religion to be set up for the purposes of eluding the ordinary course of the law"  Accordingly the unfortunate man was abandoned to his fate or if you will to the unavoidable consequence of his own obstinacy Whether his scruples were well or ill founded is more than I am able to explain We know with certainty that the Gentoo religion is in a great degree ceremonial and in a very low degree if at all dogmatical It prescribes many things to be performed many others to be abstained from but not much to be believed It forms the occupation rather than the creed of a mild inoffensive innocent people To preserve what they think a religious purity to save themselves from what they deem to be  indelible pollution I do not say that they will act with vigour that perhaps is not in their nature but I know they will suffer and endure with a patience more than human Can you doubt that Nundcomar was in earnest in the scruples he profest when I tell you that while the Judges were debating with us whether he ought to be relieved or not and while Sir Elijah Impey debated the point with us whether Nundcomar ought to be relieved or not and while he was amusing himself with writing us long letters on the subject the old man above seventy years of age resolutely persisted in refusing all manner of food for more than eighty hours In so much that the Judges themselves alarmed at the idea and possible consequences of an  illegal murder  gave an indirect permission to the jailor as it were without their knowledge to pitch a tent for Nundcomar out of the limits of the prison in which at proper hours he might perform his ablutions and prepare his food Sir Elijah Impey takes care to tell you what special pains he took to inform himself whether there was any real foundation for the religious difficulties pretended by Nundcomar  Page    He sent the pundits whom he calls  the keepers of the consciences and the oracles of the Gentoos  to examine the place of his confinement and they it seems told him that  Page    "a Bramin could not properly perform his ablutions or eat and drink in the place where Raja Nundocmar was confined But if he did he would not lose his cast but he must perform a pennance"  Now Sir it is proper you should know that these pundits in point of circumstances and situation were very low and indigent persons that they received small salaries for their attendance on the Supreme Court and were removeable at the pleasure of the Judges Admitting nevertheless that in this state of dependance they might have had courage enough to deliver an opinion adverse to the apparent inclination of the Chief Justice on whom they depended and that the opinion which they did deliver was sincere it ought not to have prevailed with Sir Elijah Impey against what he saw was the internal conviction of Nundcomar demonstrated by a determination to die rather than save his life by submitting to pollution He ought to have  known that the Hindoos are not only divided into casts but that in the same cast there are different orders and degrees not only distinct in point of rank but separated by religious rules and institutions attached and appropriated to every division of every cast and which can neither be renounced or invaded without a crime The Bramin of a lower class is no judge even of the ceremonies much less of the religious scruples of a superior Bramin When Nundcomar was informed of the report made by the pundits the old man smiled and said  "these men are not of  my  level They are no judges of  my  conscience"  Want of food was not the only distress to which this unfortunate man was obliged to submit He was confined in a miserable jail crowded with debtors and felons of all nations ranks and religions and though he might have had every accommodation which such a place could afford still I affirm that it must have been to  him  not only a loathsome but a dangerous cruel and tyrannical confinement Mr Naylor the Company's Attorney committed by Sir Elijah Impey for a contempt of the Court in not answering interrogatories died in consequence of being shut  up there a few weeks Others to  my  knowledge have suffered by it severely  In such a prison we knew that Nundcomar was perishing for want of foodThat we felt the most serious anxiety for his situation Sir Elijah Impey may affect to doubt if he thinks proper That General Clavering sent constantly to enquire about his health is charged and admitted But in this offence he had accomplices it seems whom Sir Elijah Impey has thought it perfectly proper and becoming in him to include in the charge For the sake of calumniating the memory of Sir John Clavering he brings  the ladies of his family  into public notice into the judicial view of the House of Commons Sir John Clavering's daughters are accused of sending every day to the prison with compliments to the Rajah and inquiries about his health One would think that even if there had been any thing improper in what they did the consideration due to their sex and youth to their beauty and accomplishments might have protected them from so ungenerous an allusion to their names and conduct But it is in the exercise of their charity in the display of that benevolent virtue which gives new lustre to  youth and beautyit is in the performance of the most amiable of all human duties that the daughters of General Clavering are introduced to be evidence against their father and even Lady Clavering against her husband The charge means nothing if it be not intended to convey that General Clavering had some improper connection and correspondence with the accuser of Mr Hastings Without that application the mention of the ladies of his family would be mere malice and nothing else But why not accuse  me  too of the same offence I was at least as guilty of it as they I sent messages every day to Nundcomar If knowing his situation so exactly as I did from the Sheriff I had neglected him at such a time I must have lost all sense of humanity For the same sort of purpose we are accused of having paid a visit of ceremony to Rajah Nundcomar I answer it by asking  why should we not  He was a person of the first rank in his own countryHe belonged to the highest order of the BraminsI believe he was their ChiefHe had been Prime Minister of the Government under Meer Jaffier and his son Was such a man not intitled to a visit from General Clavering Colonel Monson and  me  In point of rank he was far superior to any of us But what was the factOn the day  th April  after he was examined before the Judges at Sir Elijah Impey's house on a charge of a pretended conspiracy against Mr Hastings when the charge was dismissed and when his accusers were not even bound over to prosecute we paid him a short visit at his house I am sure it did not exceed ten minutes We saw plainly enough for what reason he was persecuted and we thought it became us to pay him that compliment as a public mark of countenance and good opinion We did not promise him protection for unfortunately we had no power to protect him  I have given you now an exact and faithful account of a transaction which I think Sir Elijah Impey would never have appealed to if he had not been blinded by a guilty mind He flattered himself that he had contrived to make it impossible to detect the falsehood of his story I believe you are satisfied that he was from the first united in close collusion with Mr Hastings that we were not mistaken in suspecting that our secret debates in Council were betrayed to  himthat our ordering Nundcomar's petition to be burned was founded on an apprehension materially connected with that suspicion that by that resolution we never meant to pronounce upon the substance or merits of the petition and that the learned gentleman himself never once thought of giving the construction to what we said or of drawing the conclusion from what we did which he now advances for the first time almost thirteen years after the event If on this last material point there be yet a doubt in the mind of any man I can remove it by the best of all evidence by that at least which usually makes the deepest impressionby the evidence of the party against himself Sir Elijah Impey's letter to the Secretary of State dated the th of January is now before me It consists of seventeen folio pages in print It appears to have been written on purpose to vindicate his character from the aspersions  uniformly  thrown upon it by Clavering Monson and Francis for his conduct in the business of Nundcomar to charge them with having  constantly  imputed to the Court the most atrocious motives for their conduct by strong insinuation malignant sarcasm and severe censure and to accuse them of attempting on sundry occasions to overawe  or reduce the authority of the Supreme Court  I beg leave to read to you a few short passages out of this studied performance  Vide Appendix to the first Report of the Select Committee in No      "The Governor General has within these few days communicated to me several Minutes signed by General Clavering Colonel Monson and Mr Francis They are severally fraught with direct charges or plain insinuations against the characters of the Judges and the conduct of the Court of Judicature Some seem more particularly levelled at  me    "The crimes either directly charged upon the Judges or indirectly insinuated which I think we have more reason to complain of as being less liberal are of so horrid and detestable a nature that if they are well grounded ought to subject each of them to the highest punishment a Parliament Impeachment can inflict and brand their names with infamy to the latest posterity    "I do sincerely attribute the offensive parts of the paragraphs to imaginations heated by party disputes and entertain so high  a sense of the honour of the Gentlemen that at a period some distance from the events which shall have given time for their judgements to cool they  will  themselves be shocked at what they have wrote and be willing to retract the charges"  I agree with this learned gentleman intirely in the definition he has given of his crimes as well as in his opinion of the punishment they deserve But I call upon him to explain to you if he can why in January he looked forward to a  future  period for a  future  retractation of the charges we had stated of the falsehoods we had written against him if it be true as he now tells you that we had already abandoned those charges if we had already acknowledged the falsehood of our assertions and borne a clear unquestionable testimony to the rectitude of his conduct The distinction he endeavours to see up between our  Minutes  which he affirms he never saw and our public act in burning the paper will be no relief to him He says he never saw our Minutes on the subject Be it so the assertion is incrediblebut I abandon that question At the present moment I do not desire you to believe what he denies but only  to remember what he has admitted He was in possession of the paper and knew that we had ordered it to be destroyed If he had really conceived that by that resolution we meant to express or imply an opinion of the  falsehood  of the contents he ought to have concluded from it then as he pretends to do now that we ourselves had acquitted him by a public voluntary act of our own of all the atrocious charges we had brought against him In that sense if the act in question was any proof at all it was full as good a proof of our favourable opinion of him as any thing we could have said in our Minutes upon the subjectIn this long letter he never mentions or alludes to either one or the other Yet that was the time if ever for him to have availed himself of the evidence of the persons he calls his enemies against themselves and to invalidate any declarations they might have made against him on other occasions instead of appealing then to the recorded factto what he now calls irresistible evidence of our opinion in his favour he expressly looks forward to a distant day when he expects that we shall be ready to condemn ourselves when we shall  he shocked at what we have written and be willing to retract our charges    "A public notification is professedly made to the English nation by which it is attempted to persuade them that the Court of Judicature established by his Majesty for protecting the natives of this country and the East India Company from the violence and oppression of the Company's servants has been by the Judges converted into an execrable instrument in the hands of Mr Hastings of destroying the innocent native for the sake of protecting the guilty servants of the Company    "It should be known that the conduct of the Council to the Judges and to the Prisoner during his confinement had raised an almost universal belief in the natives and even among the Europeans that the prisoner would be  protected  from Justice in defiance of the Court    "Raja Gourdass son of Nundcomar has caused it to be intimated to me that he was very desirous to pay his respects to me but is positively enjoined he must mean  forbidden  entering my house by members of the Council"  I have no recollection of this fact nor do I believe one word of it It is  possible  I confess that Raja Gourdass might have been  very desirous to pay his respects to Sir Elijah Impey  and for reasons perfectly coercive on the timid mind of a Hindoo But he had no occasion for our consent If he had asked me for my approbation of such a visit I should certainly have told him what I thought of it The story in effect which you are called upon to believe is that Raja Gourdass was  bonâfide very desirous to pay his respects to Sir Elijah Impey  that is to thank him for the murder of his father  I shall read but one short paragraph more out of this letter To understand it you should know that in one of our Minutes we had said  we were ignorant of any attempts to overawe or reduce the authority of the Supreme Court  "In answer to this Sir Elijah Impey says I must refer to the letters sent me by the Council in May last concerning Nundcomar the letter addressed to Mr Justice Hyde and Justice Lemaistre the  universal  tenor of the Minutes of the Council  whenever  the conduct of the Judges made part of their consultations  In this passage the terms he has selected are inclusive without exception The  universal  tenor of our Minutes was to attack to condemn and to reprobate the conduct of the Supreme Court It was so I allow it But when you have received that charge from Sir Elijah Impey when you have seen it deliberately stated and insisted on by himin writingin a formal letter to the Secretary of State for his Majesty's information will you permit him to tell you now that it was not truewill you suffer him to aver against his own record will you endure to hear him say that we did  not universally  condemn the Judges  whenever their conduct made part of our consultations  for that on the very proceeding which was essentially in question which he says we had charged as a crime  that would brand the names of the Judges with infamy to the latest posterity  on this very proceeding we had already said or done what must have amounted in our minds to a complete vindication of their conductEven now Sir I am content to let him choose what single assertion he will abide byBut no man is at libery to assert and deny the truth of the same proposition You see for what reason Sir Elijah Impey was so particular  in stating to the Committee that he had never till very lately seen our Minutes of the th of August  Had he admitted that he had seen the Minutes in Calcutta his letter to the Secretary of State would upon his present shewing have been a direct falsehood as a charge and palpably defective as a defence With those Minutes before him and understanding them in the sense of approbation or even of acquittal he could not have said that we had  universally  condemned the conduct of the Supreme Court Much less while he was defending himself against the most atrocious imputations particularly levelled at  him  could he have omitted all mention of a fact so material to his defence so irresistible in its nature as that we who accused had compleatly acquitted him  I do not mean to give the Committee any farther trouble Either the charge which this learned Gentleman has brought against Sir John Clavering Colonel Monson and myself is answered or it is not in my power to answer it Had he acted with the same candour to  me  which my honourable friend has observed to  him  had he thought proper to  deliver it in writing I would have answered it in writing Let him deliver it even now upon paper and I pledge myself to answer it in the same manner Whether he does or no it is my intention though I do not absolutely bind myself to do so to write down what I have said and to offer it to the Committee Some way or other I mean to put him in possession of my defence If his cause be good let him have all advantages in defending it Let  him  go free while he accuses and let  me  be bound down by my defence  A word more and I have done Some singular circumstances have contributed to mark me to the public eye as an object of attention In our day it has happened that two persons removed from stations of the highest trust have been accused of crimes the most atrocious that ever yet were the subject of accusation before any human tribunalone of them on evidence which in this House at least I may presume to say may be taken for conclusive The other is only accusedThe very first thing these persons think it necessary to do the very first step they make towards their defence is to declare that  I  am their enemy Their conduct tells you that I am  the first difficulty which they must endeavour to overcome that  I  am the single person whom it is essential to their safety to attack to calumniate to disqualify to discredit and to remove I am honoured by their objection I am proud of the distinction In the base vindictive meaning of enmity I am not the personal enemy of either of them But I desire it to be understood I wish to have it  roclaimed wherever my name can be known and to whatever period it shall exist that it is the possession which I value most that it is the inheritance which above all others I am anxious to transmit to my son that I am in moral principle opposed to the principles of these men that I declare and avow immortal enmity to their minds and to their conduct and that I trust that my character and principles will be known and distinguished by an eternal opposition and everlasting hostility to the manners the character the conduct and the hearts of Warren Hastings and

having been honoured with the confidence of the Nabob Jaffier Ally Khan so peculiarly the friend of the English after having discharged the first office in the Subah after being now ten years retired from all public employments and having seen my son appointed to a distinguished post with this testimony as I have been credibly informed of the Governor's approbation of his father that he instated my son in the post with a view to his profiting by my experience and wisdom I might perhaps startle the Honourable Board with an address from the  common goal had I not in a degree prepared them for some fatal change in my situation by a representation I made in the month of March of the severe menaces which had been uttered against me by the Governor General Where the first magistrate declares his determined intention of hurting an individual to the utmost of his power the enemies of the man so marked for destruction will  gerly grasp at an opportunity of gratifying  eir malice the dissolute and abandoned will find a sufficient inducement to persecute him from the hopes of gratifying the resentment of the man in power and if the unhappy man so devoted have by an upright conduct made the wicked his enemies malice and wickedness may unite their endeavours to complete his ruin To advance a step further should the first man in the State countenance one  Mohunpersaud  publicly known to be destitute of all moral principle and as publicly known to be the enemy of the person against whom he has denounced his resentment should he treat a man of such principles with a degree of distinction far above his rank in life  should he admit him to private conferences with him what is the wretched object of his resentment to expect where shall he find an asylum when the whole body of the wicked and abandoned is let loose upon him I mean not now however to deprecate the Governor General's resentment The reasons of the encouragement afforded to my enemies and the motives of the Governor General's resentment against me will be sufficiently explained to the world by the representation I have already made in a former address to the Honourable Board Should my life be taken away by the flagitious charge now laid against me the facts before alluded to will remain upon record the witnesses will be ready and the proofs produceable whenever the Governor General has courage sufficient to hear them A charge which has been now these three years depending in a Civil Court without the witnesses upon whose evidence I am committed having been once produced or mentioned has been laid against me by men who are marked by the public as the most turbulent and abandoned My only intention in setting forth the services I have done and the character I have to an advanced age supported  is to introduce my request that I might not suffer upon such a charge from the base accusation a punishment equal to that of deaththe violation of the most sacred duties of my religion The Honourable President I am well assured is fully sensible of the facts I allude to It may be requisite to explain to the rest of the Honourable Members of the Board that the institutions of our religion strictly enjoin a number of ablutions prayers and other ceremonies to be performed by the Sect of Brahmins before they can take any kind of food Nothing of this can be performed in the place where I now am and could even these obstacles be surmounted the place itself as being inhabited by men of a different religion would prevent my receiving any sustenance without breaking those rules which I have hitherto religiously observed I therefore humbly request that I may be permitted to reside under as strict a guard as may be judged requisite in some place where these objections may be obviated  Signed NUNDCOMAR  No II  Fort William    th May    Page    COUNCIL  The Jailer being arrived is called before the Board and asked his name he answers  "Matthew Yandel"  Questions by Mr

person of considerable industry and abilities was employed by the Governor General and Council to defend that Board and some persons of distinction among the natives against the late suits in the Supreme Court The Supreme Court attached Mr Naylor for a contempt on account of some steps he had taken under the direction and in favour of his clients and on his refusal to answer a series of interrogatories in which refusal he was supported by his Clients he was detained in the common goal at Calcutta a miserable and pestilential place upwards of a month For these interrogatories which your Committee conceive to be in many parts wholly unjustifiable they refer to their report of last session and to the Cossijurah Appendix to that report  No Mr Naylor who was in no good state of health at the time of this rigorous imprisonment and having had during its continuance some family misfortunes died soon after his release upon bail his death being in all probability hastened if not

in the said Court the custom of this country does not make it deserving of capital punishment nor as I am informed was life formerly forfeited for it in your country that has only been common for a few years past The Maha Rajah has transacted affairs of the greatest importance When Meer Cossim Ally Khan had taken the resolution to ruin and expel the English the Maha Rajah in particular exerted himself to the utmost with my father in supplying them with grain and money for the use  of their troops The services of the Maha Rajah on this occasion are well known to the King of Hindostan certainly he never could have committed so contemptible a crime People employed in important affairs will undoubtedly have many enemies and those who have been active in the affair of Nundcomar have long been his declared foes Taking therefore into consideration the welfare of the people I beg in particular with respect to this affair that the Rajah's execution may be suspended till the pleasure

pleased to receive my affidavit that either in my corporate capacity as a Member of the  Board or as an individual I never conceived any intention nor ever heard of such an intention suggested to me by any body that the Maha Rajah Nundcomar was to be delivered by force from the confinement he is in I think it necessary to make this affidavit because I find in a letter addressed to the Governor General and Council by Sir Elijah Impey the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature a paragraph in which he mentions that he the Chief Justice was induced contrary to his belief to make the application to the Board upon the th instant that the Governor General and Council should acquaint Maha Rajah Nundcomar to apply directly to the Judges instead of his applying to them as there were reports publicly circulated in the town that if the Judges could not be prevailed upon to release Maha Rajah Nundcomar he would be delivered by force and further I desire to declare that I never heard of such a report till I read it in Sir Elijah Impey's letter"  Governor General  "I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of the General whether on a reviewal of the words made use  of by the Chief Justice in his letter there is a necessity for his giving a mere rumour so much consequence as to take and enter upon the public records a solemn oath for the refutation of it I am morally certain that neither the Chief Justice nor any other reasonable person could entertain the most distant suspicion of an intention in the General or any other Member of this Board to commit so flagrant an outrage on the laws of their country as to attempt to rescue by force a man committed to gaol under a legal authorityI do not understand the words of the Chief Justice's letter as expressing more than a mere popular opinion which is often known to prevail without foundation and however improbable to operate to the production of the worst consequences I have heard of many reports said to be circulated by Nundcomar or his dependants but I have paid so little attention to them that I really cannot recollect any of the purport here alluded to but do not think it necessary myself to follow the General in the affidavit proposed to be taken by him if he shall still adhere to his first declaration for the refutation of a charge which I think can  neither light upon myself nor any other Member of the Council"  General Clavering  "I conceive that a declaration similar to that which I have made is absolutely necessary for the justification of each Member of this Government because the report of an attempt to deliver by force the Maha Rajah is made the ground which Sir Elijah Impey acquaints the Board he had for his application to us to direct Maha Rajah Nundcomar to apply for relief henceforward to the Judges and not to the Council By making this proposition I do not conceive myself more implicated in the charge brought as it seems to me against the Government that any other Member of it but in times when people make a trade of informations I think  no man can be safe from the danger  attending upon them especially when reports which are credited by a Chief Justice notwithstanding his declaration to the contrary might in such suspicious times be easily converted into a criminal accusation It is for these reasons that I desired that my own affidavit might be taken and I could wish that the  same solemnity might be observed by every Member of the Board"  Colonel Monson  "From the letter of Sir Elijah Impey now before the Board in which there are insinuations which may possibly be interpreted to my prejudice and disadvantage I request that my affidavit may be taken that I never had an intention either in my public or private character to use any force to release Maha Rajah Nundcomar from his confinement by the Justices of the Peace nor did I ever hear that such a rumour prevailed in the town of Calcutta until I was informed of it by the Chief Justice's letter"  Mr Francis  "I beg leave to declare upon oath that until I saw the letter from Sir Elijah Impey I never heard of the report mentioned therein and that I do not believe that an

my good wishes to the King the Gentlemen who had the direction of affairs at this place and at this time the Governor Mr Hastings who is at the head of affairs did hold and do hold me in respect never did any loss to the State or oppression of the Ryots proceed from me at this time for the fault of representing a just fact which for the interest of the King and the relief of the people I in a small degree made known many English gentlemen have become my enemies and having no other means to conceal their own actions deeming my destruction of the utmost expediency for themselves revived an old affair of Mohun Persaud which had formerly been repeatedly found to be false and the Governor knowing Mohun Persaud to be a notorious liar turned him out of his house and themselves becoming his aiders and abettors and Lord Impey and the other Judges have tried me by the English laws which are contrary to the customs of this Country in which there  was never any such administration of justice before and taking the evidence of my enemies in proof of my crime have condemned me to deathBut by my death the King's justice will let the actions of no person remain concealed And now that the hour of death approaches I shall not for the sake of this world be regardless of the next but represent the truth to the Gentlemen of the Council The forgery of the bond of which I am accused never proceeded from me Many principal people of this country who were acquainted with my honesty frequently requested of the Judges to suspend my execution till the King's pleasure should be known but this they refused and unjustly take away my life For God's sake Gentlemen of the Council you who are just and whose words are truth let not me undergo this injury but wait for the King's pleasure If I am unjustly put to death I will with my family demand justice in the next life They put me to death out of enmity and partiality to the Gentlemen who have betrayed their trust and in this case the thread of life being cut I in my last moment again request that you Gentlemen will write my case particularly to  the just King of EnglandI suffer but my innocence will certainly be made known to him  No VIII  The following is the relation of Mr  Mackraby  the Sheriff  Hearing that some persons had supposed Maha Raja Nundcomar would make an address to the people at his execution I have committed to writing the following Minutes of what passed both on that occasion and also upon my paying him a visit in prison the preceding evening while both are fresh in my remembrance  Friday evening the th of August upon my entering his apartment in the goal he arose and saluted me in his usual manner After we were both seated he spoke with great ease and such uncommon unconcern that I really doubted whether he was sensible of his approaching fate I therefore bid the interpreter inform him that I was come to shew  him this last mark of respect and to assure him that every attention should be given the next morning which could afford him comfort on so melancholy an occasion that I was deeply concerned that the duties of my office made me of necessity a party in it but that I would attend to the last to see that every desire he had should be gratified that his own pallankeen and his own servants should attend him and that such of his friends who I understood were to be present should be protected He replied that he was obliged to me for this visit that he thanked me for all my favours and intreated me to continue it to his family that fate was not to be resisted and put his finger to his forehead  "God's will must be done"  He desired I would present his respects and compliments to the  The General Sir John Clavering  General Colonel Monson and Mr Francis and pray for their protection of  Rajah Gourdass his son  Rajah Gourdass that they would please to look upon him now as the head of the Bramins His composure was wonderful not a sigh escaped him nor the smallest alteration of  voice or countenance though I understood he had not many hours before taken a solemn and affectonate leave of his soninlaw Roy Radichurn I found myself so much second to him in firmness that I could stay no longer Going down stairs the jailor informed me that since the departure of his friends he had been writing notes and looking at accounts in his usual way I began now to apprehend that he had taken his resolution and fully expected that he would be found dead in the morning but on Saturday the th at seven I was informed that every thing was in readiness at the goal for the execution I came there about half an hour past seven the howlings and lamentations of the poor wretched people who were taking their last leave of him is not to be described I have hardly recovered the first shock while I write this above three hours afterwards As soon as he heard I was arrived he came down into the yard and joined me in the jailor's apartment There was no lingering about him no affected delay he came chearfully into the room made the usual salam but would not sit till I took a chair near him Seeing somebody I forget who look at a watch he  got up and said he was ready and immediately turning to three Bramins who were to attend and take care of his body he embraced them all closely but without the least mark of melancholy or depression on his part while they were in agonies of grief and despair I then looked at my own watch told him the hour I had mentioned was not arrived that it wanted above a quarter of eight but that I should wait his own time and that I would not rise from my seat without a motion from him Upon its being recommended to him that at the place of execution he would give some signal when he had done with this world he said he would speak We sat about a quarter of an hour longer during which he addressed himself more than once to me mentioned Rajah Gourdass the General Colonel Monson and Mr Francis but without any seeming anxiety the rest of the time I believe he passed in prayer his lips and tongue moving and his beads hanging upon his hand He then looked to me and arose spoke to some of the servants of the goal telling them that any thing he might have omitted Rajah Gourdass would take care of then walked chearfully to the gate and seated himself in his  pallankeen looking round him with perfect unconcern As the Deputy Sheriff and I followed we could make no observation upon his deportment till we all arrived at the place of execution The croud there was very great but not the least appearance of a riot The Rajah sat in his pallankeen upon the bearers' shoulders and looked around at first with some attention I did not observe the smallest discomposure in his countenance or manner at sight of the gallows or any of the ceremonies passing about it He asked for the Bramins who were not come up and shewed some earnestness as if he apprehended the execution might take place before their arrival I took that opportunity of assuring him I would wait his own time  "it was early in the day and there was no hurry"  The Bramins soon after appearing I offered to remove the officers thinking that he might have something to say in private but he made a motion not to do it and said he had only a few words to remind them of what he had said concerning Rajah Gourdass and the care of his  Zenana Properly the apartments of the women meaning here in the sense of a Bramin who does not admit of polygamy his wife and children  Zenana He spoke to me and desired  that the men might be taken care of as they were to take charge of his body which he desired repeatedly might not be touched by any of the byestanders but he seemed not the least alarmed or discomposed at the croud around him There was some delay in the necessary preparations and from the awkwardness of the people but he was no way desirous of protracting the business but repeatedly told me he was ready Upon my asking him if he had any more friends he wished to see he answered he had many but this was not a place nor an occasion to look for them  "Did he apprehend there might be any present who could not get up for the crowd"  He mentioned one whose name was called but he immediately said it was of no consequence  "probably he had not come"  He then desired me to remember him to General Clavering Colonel Monson and Mr Francis and looked with the greatest composure When he was not engaged in conversation he lay back in his pallankeen moving his lips and tongue as before I then caused him to be asked about the signal he was to make which could not be done by speaking on account of the noise of the croud He said he would make a motion with his hand and  when it was represented to him that it would be necessary for his hands to be tied in order to prevent any involuntary motion and I recommended his making a motion with his feet he said he would Nothing now remained except the last painful ceremony I ordered his pallankeen to be brought close under the gallows but he chose to walk which he did more erect than I have generally seen him At the foot of the steps which lead to the stage he put his hands behind him to be tied with a handkerchief looking round at the same time with the utmost unconcern Some difficulties arising about the cloth which should be tied over his face he told the people that it must not be done by one of us I presented to him a subaltern seapoy officer who is a Bramin and came forward with his handkerchief in his hand but the Rajah pointed to a servant of his own who was laying prostrate at his feet and beckoned him to do it He had some weakness in his feet which added to the confinement of his hands made him mount the steps with difficulty but he shewed not the least reluctance scrambling rather forward to get up He then stood erect on the stage whilst I examined his countenance as  stedfastly as I could till the cloth covered it to see if I could observe the smallest symptom of fear or alarm but there was not a trace of it My own spirits sunk and I stepped into my pallankeen but before I was well seated he had given the signal and the stage was removed I could observe when I was a little recovered that his arms lay back in the same position in which I saw them first tied nor could I perceive any contortion on that side of his mouth and face which were visible In a word his steadiness composure and resolution throughout the whole of this melancholy transaction were equal to any examples of fortitude I have ever read or heard of The body was taken down after hanging the usual time and delivered to the Bramins for burning  FINIS
