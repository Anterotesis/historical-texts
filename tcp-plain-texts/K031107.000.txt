THEATREROYAL in DRURYLANE With VARIETY of SCENES and MACHINERY  The MUSIC by PURCEL and Dr ARNE  LONDON PRINTED AND SOLD BY J JARVIS N  o  STRAND  MDCCLXXXIV  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Names of  Dryden  and  Purcel  have made the following Performance hitherto regarded as one the best calculated to show the Effects of Poetry Action and Music Yet the want of a Plot sufficiently interesting and varied has prevented it keeping its Rank on the Stage as a first Piece This it is hoped will excuse the present alteration by which the whole of the Story with the most approved Parts of the Music and Machinery are compressed into two Acts leaving the beautiful Scenes of Emmeline almost wholly untouched  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Arthur King of Britain  Mr KEMBLE  Oswald King of Kent a Saxon  Mr BRERETON

put it in the bold invader's gripe  Oswald is valiant  Con  It was the character he then maintain'd  When in my Court he sought my daughter's love  My fair blind Emmeline  Aur  For that defeat in love he rais'd this war  For royal Arthur reigned within her heart  'Ere Oswald mov'd the suit  Con  Arthur is all that's excellent in Oswald  And void of all his faults in battle brave  But still serene in all the stormy war  Like heaven above the clouds and after fight  As merciful and kind to vanquish'd foes  As a forgiving God But see he's here  And praise is dumb before him  Enter King  ARTHUR  reading a letter with Attendants  Arth  reading  " Go o  auspicious Prince the stars are kind  " Unfold thy banners to the willing wind  " While I with airy legions help thy arms  " Confronting art with art and charms with charms"  So Merlin writes nor can we doubt th' event  To Con  With heav'n and you our friends Oh noble Conon  You taught my tender hands the trade of war  And now again you helm your hoary head  And under double weight of age and arms  Assert your country's freedom and my crown  Con  No more my son  Arth  Most happy in that name  Your Emmeline to Oswald's vows refus'd  You made my plighted bride  Your charming daughter who like love born blind  Unaiming hits with surest archery  And innocently kills  Con  Remember son  You are a General orther wars require you  For see the Saxon gross begins to move  Arth  By heav'n 'tis beauteous horror  The noble Oswald has provok'd my envy  Enter  EMMELINE  led by  MATILDA  Ha now my beauteous Emmeline appears  A new but Oh a softer flame inspires me  E'en Rage and Vengeance slumber at her sight  Con  Haste your farewell I'll chear my troops and wait ye  Exit Conon  Em  O father father I am sure you're here  Because I see your voice  Arth  No thou mistak'st thy hearing for thy sight  He's gone my Emmeline  And I but stay to gaze on those fair eyes  Which cannot view the conquest they have made  Oh starlight night dark only to thy self  But full of glory as those lamps of heaven  That see not when they shine  Em  What is this heav'n and stars and night and day  To which you thus compare my eyes and me  I understand you when you say you love  For when my father clasps my hand in his  That's cold and I can feel it hard and wrinkled  But when you grasp it then I sigh and pant  And something presses to my heart  Arth  Oh artless love where the soul move the tongue  And only Nature speaks what Nature thinks  Had she but eyes  Em  Just now you said I had  Arth  But neither see  Em  I'm sure they hear you then  What can your eyes do more  Arth  They view your beauties  Em  Do not I see you have a face like mine  Arth  It is not sight but touching with your hands  Em  Then 'tis my hand that sees and that's all one  For is not seeing touching with your eyes  Arth  No for I see at a distance where I touch not  Em  If you can see so fat and yet not touch  I fear you see my naked legs and feet  Quite through my clothes pray do not see so well  Arth  Fear not sweet innocence  I view the lovely features of your face  Your lips carnation your darkshaded eye brows  Black eyes and snowwhite forehead all the colours  That make your beauty and produce my love  Em  Nay then you do not love on equal terms  I love you dearly without all these helps  I cannot see your lip's carnation  Nor your shaded eyebrows nor your milkwhite eyes  Arth  Alas 'tis vain t' instruct your innocence  You have no notion of light or colours  Trumpet sounds within  Em  Why is not that a trumpet  Arth  Yes  Em  I knew it  And I can tell you how the sound on't looks  It looks as if it had an angry fighting face  Arth  'Tis now indeed a sharp unpleasant sound  Because it calls me hence from her I love  To meet ten thousand foes  Em  How does so many men e'er come to meet  This devil trumpet vexes 'em and then  They feel about for one another's faces  And so they meet and kill  Arth  I'll tell ye all when we have gain'd the field  One kiss of your fair hand the pledge of conquest  And so short a farewel  Kisses her hand and exit with  Aurel  and attendants  Em  My heart and vows go with him to the fight  May every foe be that which they call blind  And none of all their swords have eyes to find him  But lead me nearer to the trumpet's face  For that brave sound upholds my fainting heart  And while I hear methinks I fight my part  Exit led by Matilda  SCENE III A Camp Drums Trumpets and military Shouts  MARTIAL SONG sung by Mr WILLIAMS  Come if you dare our trumpets sound  Come if you dare the foes rebound  We come we come we come we come  Says the double double double beat of the thund'ring drum  Now they charge on amain  Now they rally again  The gods from above the mad labour behold  And

Oswald's arms  Or Osmond's powerful spells the field is ours  Phil  Oh master Grimbald is at hand  I snuff his earthy scent  The conquering Britons he misleads to rivers  Or dreadful downfalls of unheeded rocks  Mer  Be that thy care  Warn off the bold pursuers from the chace  But lest fierce Grimbald's pond'rous bulk oppress  Thy tender flitting air I'll leave my band  Of spirits with united strength to aid thee  Exeunt Merlin and Philidel into the cave  SCENE A Wood  Enter  GRIMBALD  and his followers disguised like shepherds leading King  ARTHUR    CONON    AURELIUS  and attendants

there's a greater doubt  Since I ne'er saw him here  How shall I meet him in another world  Mat  Indeed I know not  Em  I should find him  Among a thousand Angels in the sky  Mat  But what a kind of man do you suppose him  Em  He must be made of the most precious things  And I believe his mouth and eyes and cheeks  And nose and all his face are made of gold  Mat  Heav'n bless us Madam what a face you make him  Em  Yet I must know him better of all colours  Tell me which is the purest and the softest  Mat  They say 'tis black  Em  Why then since gold is hard and yet is precious  His face must all be made of soft black gold  Mat  But Madam  Em  No more I have learn'd enough for once  Enter on the other side of the Stage  OSWALD  and  GUILLAMAR  Osw  The night has wilder'd us and we are fall'n  Among their formost tents  Guil  Ha what are these  They seem of more than vulgar quality  Em  What sounds are those they cannot far be distant  Where are we now Matilda  Mat  Just before your

He puts the gain of Britain in one scale  Which weighing with the loss of Emmeline  He thinks he's scarce a saver  He comes with Merlin whose strong aid we hope  Enter  MERLIN  and  ARTHUR  Mer  Wait Heav'n's time th' attempt's too dangerous  There's not a tree in that enchanted grove  But's number'd out and giv'n by tale to fiends  Arth  Hadst thou been here for what can thwart thy skill  Nor Emmeline had been the boast of Oswald  Nor I forewarn'd been wanting to her guard  Con  Her darken'd eyes had seen the light of Heav'n  That was thy promise too and this the time  Mer  Nor has my aid been absent tho' unseen  I have employ'd a subtle airy sprite  T' explore the passage and prepare thy way  Myself mean time will view the magic wood  To learn whereon depends its force  Con  But Emmeline  Mer  Fear not her sight ere long shall be restor'd  Arth  Oh might I hope and what's impossible  To Merlin's art to be myself the bearer  That with the light of Heav'n she may discern  Her lover first  Mer  'Tis wond'rous hazardous  Yet I foresee th' event 'tis fortunate  I'll bear ye safe and bring you back unharm'd  Then lose not precious time but follow me  Exeunt omnes Merlin

their holy cells  And virgins in their dreams  Grim  Canst thou a devil hope to cheat a devil  A spy why that's a name abhorr'd in hell  Haste forward forward or I'll goad thee on  With iron spurs  Phil  But use me kindly then  Pull not so hard to hurt my airy limbs  I'll follow thee unforc'd Look there's thy way  Grim  Ay there's thy way indeed but for more surety  I'll keep an eye behind Not

charming objects dost thou yield  'Tis sweet when tedious night expires  To see the rosy morning gild  The mountain tops and paint the field  But when sweet Emm'line comes in sight  She makes the summer's day more bright  And when she goes away 'tis night  'Tis sweet the blushing morn to view  And plains adorn'd with pearly dew  But such cheap delights to see  Heaven and nature  Give each creature  They have eyes as well as we  This is the joy all joys above  To see to see  That only she  Whose eyes can light with love  Phil  Now see where Emmeline approaches  I leave her to thy art

the day  Now cast your eyes abroad and see  All but me  Exit  Em  Ha What was that Who spoke  Mat  I heard the voice 'tis one of Osmond's fiends  Em  Some blessed angel sure I feel my eyes  Unseal'd they walk abroad and a new world  Comes rushing on and stands all gay before me  Mat  Oh heav'ns oh joy of joy she has her sight  Em  I am newborn I shall run man for pleasure  Staring on Mat  Are women such as thou Such glorious creatures  Enter  ARTHUR  and  PHILIDEL  Arth  aside  Oh how I envy her to be first seen  Phil  Approach not yet  Em  Stand farther let me take my fill of sight  Looking up  What's that above that weakens my new eyes  Makes me not see by seeing  Mat  'Tis the sun  Em  The sun 'tis sure a God if that be Heav'n  Oh if thou art a creature best and fairest  How hast thou lighten'd even my very soul  And let in knowledge by another sense  Art thou not pleas'd Matilda Why like me  Dost thou not look and wonder  Mat  For these sights  Are to my eyes familiar  Em  That's my joy  Not to have seen before for nature now  Comes all at once confounding my delight  But ah what thing am I Fain would I know  Or am I blind or do I see but half  With all my care and looking round about  I cannot view my face  Mat  None see themselves  But by reflection in this glass you may  Gives her a glass  Em  looking in the glass  What's this  It holds a face within it O sweet face  It draws the mouth and smiles and looks upon me  And talks but yet I cannot hear it speak  The pretty thing is dumb  Mat  The pretty thing  You see within the glass is You  Em  What am I two Is this another me  Indeed it wears my cloaths had hands like mine  And mocks whate'er I do but that I'm sure  It cannot be I'd swear it were my child  Matilda looks  Look my Matilda we both are in the glass  Oh now I know it plain they are our names  That peep upon us there  Mat  Our shadows Madam  Em  Mine is the prettier shadow far than thine  I love it let me kiss my t'other self  Kissing the glass  Alas I've kiss'd it dead the fine thing's gone  Indeed it kiss'd so cold as if'twere dying  Arthur comes forward softly showing himself behind her  'Tis here again  Oh no this face is neither mine nor thine  I think the glass hath borne another child  She turns and sees Arthur  Ha What art thou with a new kind of face  And other cloaths a noble creature too  But taller bigger fiercer in thy look  Of a controuling eye majestic make  Mat  Do you not know him Madam  Em  Is't a man  Arth  Yes and the most unhappy of my kind  If you have chang'd your love  Em  My dearest Lord  Was my soul blind and could not that look out  To know you ere you spoke Oh counterpart  Of our soft sex Well are you made our Lords  So bold so great so godlike are you form'd  How can you love such silly things as women  Arth  Beauty like your's commands and man was made  But a more boisterous and a stronger slave  To you the best delights of human kind  Em  But are ye mine Is there an end of war  Are all those trumpets dead themselves at last  That us'd to kill men with their thund'ring sounds  Arth  The sum of war is undecided yet  And many a breathing body must be cold  Ere you are free  Em  How came you hither then  Arth  By Merlin's art to snatch a shortliv'd bliss  To feed my famish'd love upon your eyes  One moment and depart  Em  Oh moment worth  Whole ages past and all that are to come  Let lovesick Oswald now unpity'd mourn  Let Osmond mutter charms to sprites in vain  To make me love him all shall not change my soul  Arth  Ha Does th' enchanter practise hell upon you  Is he my rival too  Em  Yes but I hate him  For when he spoke thro' my shut eyes I saw him  His voice look'd ugly and breath'd brimstone on me  And then I first was glad that I was blind  Not to behold perdition  Enter  MERLIN  Merl  My Sovereign we have hazarded too far  But love excuses you and prescience me  Make haste for Osmond is even now alarm'd  And greedy of revenge is hasting home  Arth  Oh take my love with us or leave me here  Merl  I cannot for she's held by charms too strong  Which with th' enchanted grove must be destroy'd  Till when my art is vain but fear not Emmeline  Th' enchanter has no power on innocence  Em  to Arth  Farwell since we must part When you are gone  I'll look into my glass just where you look'd  To find your face again  If'tis not there I'll think on you so long  My heart shall make your picture for my eyes  Arth  Where e'er I go my soul shall stay with thee  'Tis but my shadow that I take away  True love is never happy but by halves  An April sunshine that by fits appears  It smiles by moments but it mourns by years  Em  May all good Angels spread their wings  And shield my love from harm  Ex Arth and Mer  Now my Arthur's gone the loveliest object  To my newborn sight I'll look round and round  Upon the lesser beauties of creation  Enter  OSMOND  at the other Door who gazes on Emmeline and she on him  Em  Ha I'm deceiv'd save me from this ugly thing  This foe to sight speak dost thou know him  Mat  Too well 'tis Oswald's friend the great magician  Em  It cannot be a man he's so unlike the man I love  Osm  Aside  Death to my eyes she sees  Em  I wish I could not but I'll close my sight  And shut out all I canIt wo'not be  Winking I see thee still thy odious image  Stares full into my soul and there infects the room  My Arthur shou'd possess  Osm  Aside  I find too late  That Merlin and her lover have been here  Em  I pr'ythee dreadful thing tell me thy business here  And if thou canst reform that odious face  Look not so grim upon me  Osm  My name is Osmond and my business love  Em  Thou hast a grizly look forbidding what thou ask'st  If I durst tell thee so  Osm  My penthouse eyebrows and my shaggy beard  Offend your sight but these are manly signs  Faint white and red abuse your expectations  Be woman know your sex and love full pleasures  Em  Love from a monster fiend  Osm  Come you must love or you must suffer love  No coyness none for I am master here  Em  And when did Oswald give away his power  Osm  O'erlabour'd with the fight opprest with thirst  That Oswald whom you mention'd call'd for drink  I mix'd a sleepy potion in his bowl  Which he quaffd greedily  The happy dose wrought the desir'd effect  Then to a dungeon's depth I sent him bound  Now know you are my slave No coying therefore  But make me happy  Em  From my sight  Thou all thy devils in one thou dar'st not force me  Osm  You teach me well  I'll give you that excuse your sex desire  He seizes her and she struggles  Grim  within  O master master  Osm  Who's that my Grimbald  Enter  GRIMBALD  hastily  Grim  O master danger threatens thee  There's a black cloud descending from above  Full of Heav'n's venom bursting o'er thy head  Osm  Malicious fiend thou ly'st for I am fenc'd  By millions of thy fellows in my grove  I bade thee when I freed thee from the charm  Run scouting thro' the wood from tree to tree  And look if all my devils were on duty  Grim  When did a devil fail in diligence  Poor mortal thou thyself art overseen  I have been there and thence I bring this news  Thy fatal foe great Arthur is at hand  Merlin has ta'en his time while thou wert absent  To counterwork thy spells  Osm  Perdition seize on Merlin  I'll cast 'em all anew and instantly  All of another mould be thou at hand  Their composition was before of horror  Now they shall be of blandishment and love  On my return proud fair  Resolve to meet my love  But if you will not fairly be enjoy'd  A little honest force is well employ'd  Exeunt Osm and Grimb  Em  Heav'n ever present to the suppliant's aid  Protect and pity innocence betray'd  Exeunt  SCENE II A Wood with a large Oak in the front  Enter  ARTHUR  and  MERLIN  on the other side  Merl  Thus far it is permitted me to go  But all beyond this spot is fenc'd with charms  I may no more but only with advice  Arth  My sword shall do the rest  Merl  Remember well that all is but illusion  Arth  Doubt me not  Merl  Yet in prevention  Of what may come I'll leave my Philidel  To watch thy steps and with him leave my wand  Farewell and prosper  Exit Merlin  Arth  walking  No danger yet I see no walls of fire  No city of the fiends with forms obscene  To grin from far on flaming battlements  This is indeed the grove I should destroy  But where's the horror sure the prophet err'd  Hark music and the warbling notes of birds  Singing of birds within  More wonders yet yet all delightful too  The Scene opens and discovers a pleasant River shaded with Trees a golden Bridge over it  A silver current here forbids my passage  And yet t'invite me stands a golden bridge  Perhaps a trap for my unwary feet  To sink and whelm me underneath the waves  With fire or water let him wage his war  Or all the elements at once I'll on  As he is going forward Nymphs and Sylvans come out from behind the Trees  SONG Miss STAGELDOIR  How happy the lover  How easy his chain  How pleasing his pain  How sweet to discover  He sighs not in vain  For love every creature  Is form'd by his nature  No joys are above  The pleasures of love  Arth  And what are these fantastic fairy joys  To love like mine False joys false welcomes all  Be gone ye sylvan trippers of the green  Fly after night and overtake the moon  Singers vanish  This goodly tree seems queen of all the grove  The ringlets round her trunk declare her guilty  Of many midnight sabbaths revell'd here  Her will I first attempt  Arthur strikes at the Tree and cuts it blood spouts out of it a groan follows then a shrick  Good heav'n what monstrous prodigies are these  Blood follows from my blow the wounded rind  Spouts on my sword and sanguine dyes the plain  He strikes again a voice of Emmeline from behind  Em  from behind  Forbear if thou hast pity ah forbear  These groans proceed not from a senseless plant  No spouts of blood run welling from a tree  Arth  Speak what thou art I charge thee speak thy being  Emmeline breaks out of the tree showing her arm bloody  Em  Whom thou hast hurt unkind and cruel see  Arth  'Tis she amazement roots me to the ground  Em  By cruel charms dragg'd from my peaceful bower  Fierce Osmond clos'd me in this bleeding bark  So that whatever sword or sounding axe  Shall violate this plant must pierce my flesh  And when that falls I die  Arth  If this be true  O never never to be ended charm  At least by me Yet all may be illusion  Break up ye thick'ning fogs and filmy mists  All that bely my sight and cheat my sense  For reason still pronounces 'tis not she  And thus resolv'd  Lifts up his sword as going to strike  Em  Do strike barbarian strike  And strew my mangled limbs with every stroke  Wound me and doubly kill me with unkindness  That by thy hand I fell  Arth  O love O Merlin whom should I believe  Em  Believe thyself thy youth thy love and me  Disarm thy hand that mine may meet it bare  Arth  If falling for the first created fair  Was Adam's fault great grandsire I forgive thee  Eden was lost as all thy sons would lose it  Going toward Emmeline and pulling off his gaunt  Enter  PHILIDEL  running  Phil  Hold poor deluded mortal hold thy hand  Which if thou giv'st is plighted to a fiend  For proof behold the virtue of this wand  Strikes Emmeline with a wand who straight descends Grimbald appears in her place  Now see to whose embraces thou wert falling  Behold the maiden modesty of Grimbald  Arth  Horror seizes me  To think what headlong ruin I have tempted  Phil  Haste to thy work a noble stroke or two  Ends all the charms and disenchants the grove  I'll hold thy mistress bound  Chains Grimbald  Arth  Then here's for earnest  Strikes twice or thrice the tree sinks amidst thunder and lightning and the bridge breaks down  'Tis finish'd and the dusk that yet remains  Is but the native horror of the wood  On yon proud towers before this day be done  My glittering banners shall be wav'd against the setting sun  Exit Arthur  Phil  Come on my surly slave come stalk along  And drag thy chain  Grim  I'll champ and foam upon't till the blue venom  Work upwards to thy hands and loose their hold  Phil  Know'st thou this pow'rful wand 'tis lifted up  A second stroke wou'd send thee to the centre  Benumb'd and dead as far as souls can die  Grim  I wou'd thou wou'd'st to rid me of my sense  SONG PHILIDEL  Iopeans fill the skies  The monster is in chains  Beneath my feet he lies  Virtue triumphant reigns  CHORUS  Victory Victory Vice is in chains  Victory Victory Virtue reigns  Exeunt  SCENE III A Camp  Enter  OSMOND  as affrighted  Osm  Grimbald made prisoner and my grove destroy'd  Now what can save meHark the drums and trumpets  Drums and trumpets within  Arthur is marching onward to the fort  I have but one recourse and that's to Oswald  But will he fight for me whom I have injur'd  No not for me but for himself he must  I'll urge him with the last necessity  Better give up my mistress than my life  And freed I'll help him with my utmost art  And try t'unravel fate  Exit Osmond  Enter  ARTHUR    CONON    AURELIUS  and  SOLDIERS  Con  Now there remains but this one labour more  And if we have the hearts of trueborn Britons  The forcing of that castle crowns the day  Aur  The works are weak the garrison but thin  Arth  Then where you see them clust'ring most  motion  And staggering in their ranks there press 'em home  For that's a coward's heapHow's this a sally  Enter  OSWALD    GUILLAMAR  and  SOLDIERS  on the other side  Beyond my hopes to meet 'em on the square  Osw  Brave Britons hold and thou their famous chief  Advancing  Attend what Saxon Oswald will propose  He owns your victory but whether owing  To valour or to fortune that he doubts  If Arthur dares ascribe it to the first  And singled from a croud will tempt a conquest  This Oswald offers let our troops retire  And hand to hand let us decide our strife  This if refus'd bear witness earth and heav'n  Thou steal'st a crown and mistress undeserv'd  Arth  I'll not usurp thy title of a robber  Nor will upbraid thee that before I proffer'd  This single combat which thou did'st avoid  So glad I am on any terms to meet thee  And not discourage thy repenting shame  As once Aeneas my fam'd Ancestor  Betwixt the Trojan and Rutilian bands  Fought for a crown and bright Lavinia's bed  So will I meet thee hand to hand oppos'd  My auguting mind assures the same success  To his men  Hence out of view if I am slain or yield  Renounce me Britons for a recreant knight  And let the Saxon peacefully enjoy  His former footing in our famous isle  To ratify these terms I swear  Osw  You need not  Your honour is of force without your oath  I only add that if I fall or yield  Your's be the crown and Emmeline  Arth  That's two crowns  No more we keep the looking heav'n and sun  Too long in expectation of our arms  both armies go off the stage  Arthur and Oswald fight Oswald retreats Enter Osmond from among the trees and with his wand strikes Arthur's sword out of his hand and exit Oswald pursues Arthur Merlin enters and gives Arthur his sword and exit They close and Arthur in the fall disarms Oswald  Arth  Confess thyself o'ercome and ask thy life  Osw  'Tis not worth asking when 'tis in thy power  Arth  Then take it as my gift  Osw  A wretched gift  With loss of empire liberty and love  A concert of trumpets within proclaiming Arthur's victory while they sound Arthur and Oswald seem to confer  'Tis too much bounty to a vanquish'd foe  Yet not enough to make me fortunate  Arth  Thy life thy liberty thy honour safe  Lead back thy Saxons to their ancient Elb  I wou'd restore thee fruitful Kent the gift  Of Vortigern for Hengist's illbought aid  But that my Britons brook no foreign power  To lord it in a land sacred to freedom  And of its rights tenacious to the last  Osw  Nor more than thou hast offer'd wou'd I take  I would refuse all Britain held in homage  And own no other masters but the gods  Enter on one side Merlin Emmeline and Matilda Conon Aurelius with British soldiers bearing King Arthur's standard displayed On the other side Guillam  and Osmond with Saxon soldiers dragging their colours on the ground  Arth going to Emme and embracing her  Arth  At length at length I have thee in my arms  Em  We are so fitted for each other's hearts  That heav'n had erred in making of a third  To get betwixt and intercept our loves  Osw  Were there but this this only sight to see  The price of Britain should not buy my stay  Mer  Take hence that monster of ingratitude  And in that loathsome dungeon plunge him deep  Where he plung'd noble Oswald  Osm  That indeed is fittest for me  For there I shall be near my kindred fiends  And spare my Grimbald's pains to bear me to 'em  Is carried off  Mer  to Arth  Arthur thou hast acquir'd immortal fame  And of three Christian worthies art the first  And now at once to treat thy sight and soul  Behold what rolling ages shall produce  The wealth the loves the glories of our isle  Nor thou brave Saxon Prince  to Oswald  disdain our triumph  Britons and Saxons shall be once one people  One common tongue one common faith shall bind  Our jarring bands in a perpetual peace  Merlin waves his wand the scene changes and discovers the British ocean in a storm Aeolus in a cloud above  Enter  NEPTUNE  Ye blust'ring brethren of the skies  Whose breath has ruffl'd all the wat'ry plain  Retire and let Britannia rise  In triumph o'er the main  Serene and calm and void of fear  The queen of islands must appear  Aeolus ascends and the four winds fly off Britannia rises from the sea  Enter  VENUS  and  CUPID  SONGMiss PHILLIPS  Fairest isle all isles excelling  Seat of pleasures and of loves  Venus here will chuse her dwelling  And for sake her Cyprian groves  Cupid from his fav'rite nation  Care and Envy will remove  Jealousy that poisons passion  And Despair that dies for love  Gentle murmurs sweet complaining  Sighs that blow the fire of love  Soft repulses kind disdaining  Shall be all the pains you prove  Every swain shall pay his duty  Grateful every nymph shall prove  And as these excel in beauty  Those shall be renown'd for love  Mer  Those who next enter are our valiant Britons  Who shall by sea and land repel our foes  A march while the British sailors and grenadiers come to the front of the stage  Now look above and in Heav'n's high abyss  Behold what fame attends those future heroes  The Order of the Garter descends  SONGBy Mr WILLIAMES  I  St George the patron of our isle  A soldier and a saint  On that auspicious Order smile  Which love and arms will plant  II  Our natives not alone appear  To court this martial prize  But foreign Kings adopted here  Their crowns at home despise  III  Our Sovereign high in awful state  His honours shall bestow  And see his scepter'd subjects wait  On his commands below  FINIS
