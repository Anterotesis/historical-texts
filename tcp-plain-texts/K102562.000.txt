 THE SCOTTISH VILLAGE OR PITCAIRNE GREEN  PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  THE SCOTTISH VILLAGE OR PITCAIRNE GREEN A POEM BY MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON IN PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXXVII  A PREFACE  READING the paper lately at breakfast I saw an account of the splendid ceremonies used at Pitcairne Green in Scotland on marking the boundaries of an extensive village to be erected on that spot for the purpose of introducing the Lancashire manufactures These ceremonies were assisted by all the persons of consequence of each sex in that part of the kingdomamongst the Ladies were Mrs Graham Lady C Graham c c As my eye ran it over it dropt a tear on the passage It must have appeared ridiculous enough for there was certainly nothing very moving in ithowever I have ventured to give both the tear and the feelings which made it start to the Genius of the place I wrote merely to appease my sensations and having written according to the old story my friends  advised me to publish and they are obeyed If the public should not find the trifle interesting they will at least do it the justice to let it slide into oblivion and forgive I trust the few hours the composition cost me  The little work has not been without its difficulties My canvas was to hint a Landscapea Landscape in a country which I had never seen The accounts presented by travellers might be false or they might be invidious yet  they  were to govern me Notwithstanding I yielded to this images very dissimilar crouded to my pen the prospects of Devondear native scenes were for ever before me and all my recollection was necessary to prevent the tears of Dryades from falling for the loss of their shades and the Nightingale from pouring its regrets that its ancient habitations were invaded  Had the scite of the intended village been in that province description would have had room to rangefancy might have rioted and the most luxuriant imagination sated itself There a poet might have led his readers through verdant lanes for so in other counties Devon's  turnpikes  would be named where the high hedges composed of hawthorn sweetbrier myrtle  and a thousand flowers effectually screens the traveller from the most sultry sunthere through the breaks a country presents itself all enchantment and where if the Cottager did not boast views as delightful as the Nabob and the Patrician the whole province might be mistaken for one vast artificial pleasureground Whilst the ear is filled with all the music poured from the throats of the goldfinch the blackbird and the thrush the eye incessantly wanders over painted meads and roves from hill to dalerests on the soft foliage of sloping woods and pursues the serpentine of pellucid riversbeholds fields of burnished corn waving like a golden sea to the tremulous breeze and orchards loaden with such fruit as makes the story of the Hesperides scarcely seem a fable  This little sketch literal not poetical is for the information of those of my friends in Scotland who have not yet crossed the Tweed and to suggest to them when they do not to return persuaded of having seen the landscapes of England unless they have travelled through Dorsetshire Somerset and DEVON  It has been told to me that this village and Doctor Goldsmith's will be contrastedI earnestly deprecate so fatal a comparison Goldsmith's is the poem of a Politician and soars with a strong wingmine is a butterfly fluttering over the field and here and there reposing on a cowslip or a daisey  That  was defended from criticism by its magnitude may  this  find safety in its littleness  H COWLEY  To those who may think the measure in which the poem is written needs an excuse the following is offered  The  alternate verse  of ten syllables has been pronounced by Dryden whose knowledge of English metre was not inconsiderable to be the most perfect of all the measures which our language affords  DOCTOR JOHNSON  THE SCOTTISH VILLAGE OR PITCAIRNE GREEN  WHY weeps the Genius of the arid waste  Bending thus pensive from her fulgent sky  Can beings pure like thee of sorrow taste  Those next to Angel ever breathe a sigh  Sage yet unlearn'd 'tis now thy hour to know  That the dear privilege to feelto sigh  To bid the tear from sacred pity flow  Is not alone for man or earthform'd eye  Where the preeminence that Angels boast  If coldly conscious in eternal rest  They form a bright insensate vap'ry host  By Heav'n's most precious gift to FEEL unblest  The keenest feelings of the human mind  Exist more keenly in the angelic frame  More elevated poignant and refin'd  As earth's more sordid than ethereal flame  Wonder not therefore that an Angel's brows  Thus drooping should no cheering lustre shed  But give attentionso thy fate allows  Whilst I record the woes for which it fled  Behold this plain stretch'd by Creation's hand  When each chaotic element arous'd  Sprung forth elastic at the dread command  Fled to its home and there obedient hous'd  Since that first instant of the youngborn time  Guiltless the moments of this plain have run  Each closing year and summer's happy prime  In sweet simplicity its hours have spun  The yellow broom that gilds its farthest bounds  And verdant carpet softly spread between  Mark where light fairies nightly trip their rounds  Happy to gambol secret and unseen  Here calmest zephires waft their airy wings  And birds of solitude flit musing by  And sometimes too the bird that sweetly sings  Chants forth its pleasures to the lucid sky  Whilst in the blushing chambers of the west  A thousand tender dies their tints prepare  Which rapidly th' horizon round invest  Streaming prismatic glories thro' the air  That russet mountain on whose farthest side  The modest beams of morn first ever play  Till from its top the ardent sun looks down  And gilds the valley with a bolder ray  Owns in its riven base a cavern dank  Where oozing filter'd drops of doubtful green  Harden'd suspended hang like willows lank  A sparkling jewell'd vegetative scene  In that resplendent grove a hermit read  Mysterious nature's laws that never swerve  His life the virtues and religion led  To sanctify the space you now observe  Here rapt in SECOND SIGHT he frequent saw  The future scene appear and fade away  His country groan beneath the feudal law  Or glut with power the tyrant of the day  Its neighbour England with irruptive bands  Watching each turn and shadings of its fate  To bind with manacles its warlike hands  And make it feodal to her haughtier state  At length with pride he saw his Scotland give  Monarchs to wear its rival's splendid crown  Blest in THE UNION saw each kingdom live  Bound in one Empiretasting one Renown  Sacred to visions grand like these was kept  The varied circle this horizon bounds  And when with Seers long past the Hermit slept  Still shadowy visitants breath'd heav'nly sounds  'Twas thus when feuds unfilial tore the land  And horrid war her crimson flag unfurl'd  And dread rebellion with its sanguine hand  Midst peaceful swains its sharpest mis'ries hurl'd  'Twas thus this hallow'd spot misfortune spar'd  Nor war nor mis'ry in its precincts dwelt  No cry of woe its peaceful bound'ries scar'd  No mother by her bleeding offspring knelt  Did turbid clans e'er press this mossy heath  Have rival Thanes here proudly clash'd the shield  'Twas not with hostile thoughts nor vows of death  They came not here to conquer but to yield  Here hath the oath of mutual peace been bound  Here melting Chiefs their melting foes embrace  And all the sounds that martial joy breathes round  Erst have reach'd Heaven from this selected place  But rolling years have drawn their veil between  Nay ages born of ages past away  Since the soft calm which blest this modest green  Knew the loud clamours of a martial day  Repose and peace have hover'd near  Whilst vice and shame their haunts at distance keep  Unknown alike to violence and fear  Here terrors shrink not and no sorrows weep  But now approacheth fast the hour of change  E'en whilst I speak the scene I vaunt is past  Here shall no more the feath'ry fairies range  The late nocturnal revel was their last  See quick advance the num'rous motley croud  Mechanics Pedants Traders pour along  Their joy breaks forth in carols rude and loud  And beauty's presence animates the song  The verdant face of this once happy plain  The sharptooth'd mattock shall deform and tear  That evil first and then an endless train  Follow the footsteps of yon graceful Fair  They bid  The future Town submissive to their will  Rises from Earth and spreads its skirts around  Oh that the marble in its quarry still  Unhewn unform'd had kept its rest profound  With it the social evils all rush in  Th' opposing passions that distract mankind  The blazon'd crime the sly wellcover'd sin  Nor will one petty vice remain behind  Slander and avarice and pen'ry scant  The proud man's scorn the rich man's sturdy mien  Widesquand'ring luxury and pallid want  All haste to form the varied wretched scene  And shall the mighty woes of hapless love  Be here unfelt the heart not here be torn  Oh no in all their violence they'll rove  Swains shall betray and maidens  feel  their scorn  Already sure the dismal sounds I hear  The broken vow accus'd the rending sigh  Ah see the lovelorn stretch'd upon her bier  Rent from all joy she only knew to die  False friendship too spreads out its closewove net  And stabs the trusting with a barbed spear  Its arrows black ingratitude has set  Yonder a robber skulks a murd'rer here  Ah canst thou wonder Sage I mourn the hour  Thou'st heard the cause that swell'd my starting tear  Haste and reflect within thy secret bower  Ponder the change and be thy grief sincere  Here paus'd the Genius Age bent low its head  Its hoary tresses floating on the wind  Oh bright Intelligence then firmly said  Permit a mortal to unveil his mind  Sad is your prophecy and oh too sure  Fate will its utmost latitude fill up  Each promis'd ill 'tis fix'd we must endure  And drink from sorrow's still replenish'd cup  But not unmix'd the bitter draught shall flow  Not unallay'd the hov'ring mis'ries sting  Felicities shall blunt the sense of woe  And o'er it joys their downy mantle fling  If social evils overspread thy plain  The social blessings too will haste along  And on the spot where vice shall lead its train  Illustrious virtues eagerly shall throng  Yonder rude circuit where th' obtrusive fern  In "sullen vegetation" chills the glance  A few revolving halcyon months shall turn  To an allcheering lucid gay expanse  SCOTLAND's GRAND STAPLE there shall glad the sight  Courting the blanching beams of day's bright orb  Who'll give enduring lustre to its white  And ev'ry slight impurity absorb  There from the loom the costly web be brought  By Pallas taught in soft festoons to rise  Which late from Belgia distant kingdoms sought  But now 'tis Caledonia grants the prize  There the rich damask spread its fruit and flowers  For royal tables and for halls of state  There the transparent lawn display its powers  To soften beauty and new charms create  Proud Manchester will here her fame divide  Her varied works her fashion and her taste  This bind in snowy vest Horatio's side  That flow in graceful folds from Chloe's waist  The stripe so well dispos'd the glowing bloom  Which overspreads the whole shall here be seen  Go MANCHESTER and weep thy slighted loom  Its arts are cherish'd now on PI'TCAIRNE GREEN  For these whilst Labour chants her jocund song  Shall foreign prows be pointed to our shores  Each rival port our ample harbours throng  Pouring its tribute for our native stores  Thus blest this village shall some unborn age  Behold a city grac'd with many a dome  Of note in commerce and of arts the stage  Where taste industrious ne'er shall want a home  If here the craving miser heaps his gold  And frowns upon the shiv'ring needy wretch  Here shall benevolence her charger hold  And pity wide her fost'ring arms outstretch  Soft elegance shall bid around us rise  The spell all feel but never can describe  Scarce tangible by thought the pen it flies  Pride cannot catch it nor importance bribe  Not sense not loveliness nor wealth nor wit  But form'd of all the charming phantom rose  Adorns each time and place with graces fit  But in domestic hours supremely glows  And who like Scotland's daughters so prepar'd  To spread the fascinating sweet around  When thro' the Sex great Nature beauty shar'd  Who knows not here the richest gift was found  Thus tho' disast'rous love should find a grave  Or mourn the violated vow of bliss  Yet here shall faithful Love the maiden save  And parents cheer her with the nuptial kiss  The song of rapture shall the bridegroom pour  As oft he wanders thro' the sunny glades  And brides shall bless the sacred binding hour  Whisp'ring their transports in the secret shades  For shades SHALL be where now the thistle red  Spreads o'er the heath its slender prickly stalks  And where the tangley furze conceals its bed  There shall the grove divide its tepid  If this word is objected to it may be recollected that though a grove in Africa would be cool in Scotland it must be warm  walks  For Nature's self to Commerce ever yields  Commerce whose power each hemisphere adorns  Which bids the dunny heath bloom forth in fields  And in the Desert pours the Naiades' urns  Yes that blest power will here exert her force  And wooing sterile nature to its arms  Bid stranger riv'lets wind their silv'ry course  And native moors conceal with foreign charms  But happier still LEARNING shall raise the pile  Design'd the fret of ages to withstand  Within the classic scholar form his stile  And pour instruction thro' the list'ning land  Ah from its walls some future sage may burst  To charm or awe the centuries to come  A THOMSON in its cells be haply nurs'd  A BLAIR shed splendor o'er the chosen dome  The Lawgiver from thence shall draw the seeds  Of growing honour dignity and fame  Here shall ensure the future splendid meeds  That crown his labours and extend his name  A MANSFIELD ERSKINE LOUGHBOROUGH shall rise  The boast of genius in untasted times  Spreading our glory round the distant skies  And mark us ENVIED by more happy climes  Philosophy's profound disciples too  Shall in its ayles a new Lyceum find  Platonic ethics system plain and true  Shall there be honour'd in the tutor'd mind  A HUMEa second HUME from thence may shine  In lustre like the first but oh his heart  Shall humbly melt before Religion's shrine  And prompt his talents to a better part  A ROBERTSON shall bid the copious stream  Of longcollected knowledge fill his page  Dark ages make with light reverted gleam  And brightstept freedom trace from stage to stage  So a vast reservoir's compacted flood  To bless a famish'd people spends its wealth  Pours out itself to renovate their blood  By Heaven supplied with future stores of health  A polish'd STUART too will then be known  To scatter roses o'er the slander'd Fair  To bind the cypress round the riven crown  And steal our tears for miseries so rare  His name shall ever tender Beauty prize  First in the climax of the literate few  Who from the mold of time still bright arise  And ev'ry rapid cent'ry keep in view  And ah whilst future  Bayes  luxuriant spread  Shall not the  Myrtle  in our gardens glow  Yes whilst the laurel crowns the manly head  The blossoms for the fair shall gladlier blow  A Scottish SEWARD shall demand the prize  She from whose pensive and mellifluous throat  Where e'er misfortune scowls her cheerless eyes  Is pour'd the pitying melancholy note  Thus the sad Nightingale throughout the night  Her fond complaint rings thro' the leafy grove  And so endears the scene we dread the light  Detest the sprightlier note and sorrow love  For glowing BARBAULD shall another Isle  Be found amidst some distant frozen waves  Which deck'd in all the fervors of her stile  Shall bloom like that  Corsica  she from oblivion saves  Perchance that Isle convulsive nature tore  Wrathful from sad Messina's oncefam'd port  When the proud marbles which adorn'd its shore  Were dash'd on rocks and made the billows' sport  When the mad mother and the swallow'd child  The tott'ring palace and the tower prone  Gave at one view ruin so vast and wild  As chills the quicken'd flesh almost to stone  Then in that lab'ring moment of the earth  Midst the Norwegian seas an island sprung  Let Barbauld celebrate the wond'rous birth  And all its grandeur by her muse be sung  She'll lift the veil of time and shew us how  The climate works upon the cind'ry  The island on its emerging about three years since was said to make this appearance and afterwards to disgorge flames  mass  What the vast prospects of the unborn NOW  And all its figures in her magic glass  She'll shew that land which when beneath the skies  Of soft Italia bloom'd in scented flowers  Painted its surface with the richest dyes  And burst in hills and gave its shade in bowers  She'll shew it then divest of ev'ry sweet  That once endear'd it to the eye of taste  No flowers no rills the wand'ring eye shall meet  No soft embroid'ry o'er the snowy waste  But tho' not sweet the scen'ry will be grand  Not rills but torrents will her muse display  That  roar  when rigid winds become more bland  Grow  dumb  and stiffen in the wint'ry ray  No gentle hill but mountains vast she'll shew  Whose cracking pines confess strong Boreas' arm  Where wild volcanoes from their summits glow  And give the plains beneath an awful charm  Arcades and temples perhaps her muse will sing  But not of marble form'd nor part for part  O no  Nature will here the noble sculpture bring  Wildly magnificent not cramp'd by art  Th' arrested cataract a dome will form  And rapid torrents bound in pillars rise  Their capitals be sculptur'd from a storm  Snatch'd as 'tis rushing from the Zemblian skies  On these the polar sun will pour its beams  Tinting the glacid scene with shifting hues  Now strong now fading into fainter gleams  And then at once a ruddy blaze infuse  These are but outlinesan unskilful sketch  A powerful Barbauld must the shadings give  No colder genius on its utmost stretch  Can bid the frigid cheerless landschape live  Attention tired with fancied scenes like these  Recoils and wishes for familiar hours  Pants for the pillow'd chair the robe of ease  And gladly yields to common life its powers  What pen but BURNEY's then can sooth the breast  Who draw from nature with a skill so true  In ev'ry varying mode it stands confest  When brought by her before th' enquirer's view  A power  peculiar  all her portraits fill  When lines are bold and strong a vulgar pen  May take the sketch it asks no mighty skill  Misers to paint or mad or wayward men  But human nature in its  faintest  dye  Burney detects drags it to open day  Makes evident what slip'd the unmarking eye  And bids it glare with truth's pervading ray  The huddled beings of the common mass  Who to themselves appear of equal sort  Must not in unawaken'd error pass  And sure 'tis this is keeney'd Burney's fort  Touch'd by her spear they sudden spring to sight  But not new form'dshe shews them as they are  She  molds  no character but gives the light  Which makes them clear as Herschel sees a star  Yes such as these thy plain may one day boast  Prizesweet INTELLIGENCE oh prize the change  Laurels will then surround our letter'd coast  And here the muses from Parnassus range  This vacant wild till now expanse unblest  Unknown and useless in the general scale  Slumb'ring its ages in ignoble rest  Scorn'd or unheeded in th' historic tale  Shall hence assume a rank confess a name  Nor hid a barren disregarded spot  But living in the breath of future fame  Shall bless its happy tho' its latedrawn lot  Thus stopt the Sagethe Genius paus'd awhile  As tho' his honied words revolving o'er  First rais'd her eye with a celestial smile  Which seem'd to promise she would mourn no more  Then in sweet toneOh man of snowy years  'Tis truth inspires thee and her force I own  'Tis she hath chid away the falling tears  And bad my fading joys again be blown  Yes the CREAT GUARDIAN of the gen'ral weal  Ne'er gives a mis'ry but he sends a cure  As herbs their antidotes will e'er reveal  In the same fields which pois'nous herbs endure  To thee I leave the bliss which just men know  Felicities which pious acts attend  O'er thy white tresses they shall ever flow  And cheer the anxious moments of thy end  Then darting upwards as the Sage ador'd  Her golden pinions clave the liquid way  A blushing radiance mark'd the path she soar'd  Till lost amidst the blaze of azure day  THE END  The DRAMATIC WORKS of Mrs COWLEY consisting of the following Pieces viz  I The RUNAWAY A Comedy
