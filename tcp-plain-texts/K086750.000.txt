 A SERMON Preach'd before the RIGHT HONOURABLE the LORD MAYOR THE ALDERMEN AND  CITIZENS  of LONDON AT THE Cathedral CHURCH of St  PAUL  of FRIDAY the Twenty Ninth Day of  May    BEING THE Anniversary Day of THANKSGIVING for the RESTORA∣TION of King  Charles  the Second the Royal Family and Government  By  JAMES TOWNLEY  M A Lecturer of St  Dunstan's in the East  and Chaplain to the Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR  LONDON  Printed for FRANCIS GOSLING at the  Mitre and Crown  in  Fleetstreet  MDCCXLI  LAMBERT  Mayor  Tuesday  the Ninth Day of  June  and in the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of King  GEORGE  the Second  of  GreatBritain  c  IT is ordered that the Thanks of this Court be given to the Reverend Mr  Townley  for his Sermon preached before this Court and the Liveries of the seve∣ral Companies of this City at the Cathe∣dral Church of St  Paul  on  Friday  the Twenty Ninth Day of  May  last being the Anniversary Day of Thanksgiving for the Restoration of the Royal Family and Government and that he be desired to print the same  MAN  To the Right Honourable  Daniel Lambert  Esq  LORD MAYOR OF THE CITY of  LONDON  My LORD  I WOULD fain have suppressed this Sermon being sensible that it is very inaccurate and imperfect but as it is Your particular Order that it should appear in the World it must entirely de∣pend on Your LORDSHIP'S Patronage for a favourable Reception  To insist on those Virtues that are so eminent in You wou'd be disagreeable to a Person of Your LORDSHIP'S Temper and only a Repetition of the Sentiments of all Your FellowCitizens But since You have been pleas'd to admit me to a great Degree of Intimacy with Yourself and by that means have made me a Wit∣ness  of Your Sincerity and Integrity Your Goodnature and Generosity Your strict and impartial Execution of Justice and above all Your Concern and Regard for Religion I cannot help taking this Occasion of publickly acknowledging the Honour and Happiness I therein receive  MAY that God whose Worship and Service You endeavour to promote by the best and most effectual Method a good Example show'r down his Blessings upon You and prosper all Your Labours for the Welfare of the Nation in general and of this City in particular  THIS is the hearty and sincere Prayer of  My LORD  Your Lordship's Most Obedient and most obliged Servant JAMES TOWNLEY  PSALM L  Offer unto God Thanksgiving  T  HE Prophet  Samuel  in his Re∣proof to  Saul  styles his Successor  Sam xiii  The Man after God's own Heart  Which Character was exemplified in no one Instance more than in that tho∣rough Knowledge Holy  David  had of the Will of God with regard to the Service he expects from his Creatures  OF this Knowledge likewise the  Asaph  Author of this Psalm had a large Share  Vid Patric Comment  whose Words King  Hezekiah  Chron xxix  commanded the Levites to make use of with those of  David  in the House of the Lord He was fully sensible  that the Obedience God requires from Men is that of the Heart The Sacrifice of their Wills far more pleasing to him than Incense or  Sam xv  the Fat of the Rams  AND the Reason of this is evident For if a Man reflects He will find that his Will is that alone which he can properly call his own and therefore the only Sacrifice he can offer unto the Almighty To offer unto him Burntofferings  Psal  the Bullock out of thine House or HeGoat out of thy Flock  is to offer unto him what is his own since  all the Beasts of the Forest are his and so are the Cattle upon a Thousand Hills I know  says God  all the Fowls upon the Mountains and the wild Beasts of the Field are in my Sight If I be hungry I will not tell thee for the whole World is mine and all that is therein Thinkest thou that I will eat Bull's Flesh and drink the Blood of Goats  Then it follows as a full Declaration of what Sacrifice God is delighted with and a Command moreover to perform the same  Offer unto God Thanks∣giving  NOTHING but supine Indolence and the utmost Indifference to Things of a spiritual Nature can make this Duty so neglected  among Men and suffer the Goodness of God to pass away with so little Regard The Mercies which he is pleased each Day to confer upon us seem to have no other Effect with the Generality I mean that to make us confident of a Succession of them the follow∣ing Day No other Effect than to assist us in flattering ourselves that we are the peculiar People of God and to teach us to presume that he who hath ever been mindful of us will ever continue to be so Yet this is not the Whole of the Case For it is observable that those Persons who are so unmindful of the Blessings of God who permit such re∣peated Instances of his Mercy to slip out of their Minds without any Mention or Ac∣knowledgment of them are the first to com∣plain and murmur if an Accident disap∣points their Schemes and Designs or any thing falls out contrary to their Wishes and Inclinations Surely this is a most notori∣ous Indication what Strangers we are to God and the Ways of his Providence and how wholly our Minds are busied and delighted with the Affairs of this World  A SIGNAL Act indeed of Mercy a Mark of God's special Providence will raise in many Men a sudden Spirit of Gratitude a certain  Warmth and Eagerness to give Praise unto God But soon does that Spirit subside Variety of Diversions and Hurry of Business quickly damp that Fire and introduce Lukewarmness and Indifference But if the Bles∣sing receiv'd be remembered for a Time it is often remembered in wanton Gratitude ex∣press'd by unseemly Mirth and Jollity and most frequently ending in Excess and Intem∣perance So evident is that Truth That if the common and daily Mercies of God cannot awaken in us a Spirit of Gratitude neither shall we be persuaded to a constant Practice of this Duty tho' the most extraordinary Act of Mercy were wrought in that Behalf  THANKSGIVING is distinguish'd from Praise as it is a more confin'd Duty or rather a Part of that general one It has respect to those Blessings and Mercies which concern ourselves whereas Praise terminates in God with re∣gard to his own great and infinite Per∣fections  THANKSGIVING consists in a grateful Sense of any Mercy we have receiv'd from God express'd by such outward Signs as are most agreeable to our Joy It implies not only a present Acknowledgment of his Favours but such a constant Remembrance of them  that no worldly Honours or Success can de∣face or blot out of our Minds Moreover it includes a due Reflection on those Favours and requires that we set a just Value on them omitting no Circumstance that may heighten their Excellence But this Duty is best express'd when the Mercies of God excite in us a Love and Reverence of his Name and an hearty Desire and sincere Endeavour to present ourselves  Rom xii  a living Sacrifice holy ac∣ceptable unto him  HEREIN consists the Duty of Thanksgiving How reasonable an one it is every Man must at once confess when he considers to whom it is to be paid To him who first gave and still continues our Being To him who hath created all Things in Heaven and Earth for our Comfort and Convenience  Jam i  Who giveth liberally and upbraideth not  re∣quiring as a Return for his Kindness the Ac∣knowledgment of it and the Performance of some Duties that are by no means difficult to practise Whose Providence watches over us at all Times in every Place and under all Circumstances when we are rash and incon∣siderate when we are careless and negligent and when we are buried in Sleep and cannot  so much as think how to secure ourselves or any thing belonging to us Who is so gra∣cious as to call us his Friends and under that endearing Relation to admit us to a free In∣tercourse with himself permitting us to call him Father and to make known our Requests unto him by Prayer and Supplication Who with an Eye of Pity beholds our Sorrows re∣lieves our Wants assists our Infirmities and sends us Strength and Patience to support our∣selves under Tryals and Afflictions But a∣bove all who hath sent his only begotten Son from his own right Hand into the World to take upon him our Nature and its Infir∣mities to die in our stead and by his Death to make us Inheritors of Life and Glory and who when through our manifold Transgres∣sions we provoke him to Wrath at the In∣tercession of his Son does still forgive us and suffers not his Displeasure to arise  THERE is one Circumstance which must greatly recommend this Duty to us and that is its Excellence We cannot pay a more acceptable Service to our Lord than Thanks∣giving A service which of all others he is most delighted with Nay which he is plea∣sed to distinguish in a very peculiar manner  Ps l  Whoso offereth me Thanks and Praise he ho∣noureth me  Honoureth God How em∣phatically does this Expression set forth the Excellence of Thanksgiving and graciously encourage us in the Performance of the Duty Let it not then be termed a mercenary one let it not be construed to proceed from Selfish∣ness since there cannot be that Principle in any Man's Heart who makes the utmost Re∣turn he is able for a Benefit receiv'd No Selfishness is the Parent of Ingratitude a Sin most unpardonable in us and most de∣testable in the Sight of God But Thankful∣ness proceeds from another Principle a Prin∣ciple of Love deriv'd to us from the Fountain of Love God himself It is not an Address of Interest a Petition to him for more Bles∣sings 'tis an humble Acknowledgment of his excellent Mercy and Goodness in what he has already bestowed  THE Reasons and Occasions of the Duty must of necessity make it a pleasant one Because the Recollection of every Mercy is a kind of second Enjoyment We are assur'd by one who was very conversant in it that  Ib cxlvii  it is a joyful and pleasant Thing to be thankful  It must besides administer great Delight to  the Mind as it enlarges its Powers and rai∣ses it from low and trifling Objects which darken and debase it to that great and noble one the Divine Being  SUCH is the Nature Reasonableness and Excellence of Thanksgiving a Duty requir∣ed from and incumbent upon all since all have tasted of the Mercies of God  THE same Obligations which affect every Individual for the particular Instances of Kindness shewn to him will respectively af∣fect all Communities and Bodies of Men and consequently all States and Kingdoms  IT must be confess'd by ourselves and all others who are acquainted with our History that this Nation has experienced the most sen∣sible Marks of the Divine Favour has been most signally and wonderfully preserv'd in Times both of the greatest Danger and most extreme NecessityThe God of Hosts has often gone out with us to Battle  YEA  We had at this Time receiv'd the welcome News of the taking the Forts and Castles of  Carthagena  and were in expe∣ctation of soon hearing that the Town itself was taken  at this Instant I speak with all due Deference we have some Reason to believe that  Ps cxxiv  The Lord is on our Side  that he has  most graciously answer'd our Petitions and is  See the Additional Prayer for the War  gone forth with our Fleets and Armies  THIS is a Mercy not which our Fathers have told us but which we do now see and hear and which loudly calls for our most de∣vout Thanks to the Author And with them our further Prayers that he would be pleas'd to continue to us his Favours and to preserve that Great Man Who truly sollicitous for the public Good left his Ease and Retirement to enter upon a painful and hazardous Expe∣dition Who departed not in the Spirit of Re∣venge but with an Heart full of Courage and Resolution equalled only by his Prudence and Moderation In Whose generous and ho∣nest Breast the Love of his Country appears to be the governing Principle and Who seems to rejoice that it hath pleased God to make him the Instrument of recovering its just Rights of chastising a faithless and insolent Enemy  After two rigorous Winter Seasons the first of which was very remarkable and a long excessive Drought when our old Stores were greatly exhausted and a most melancholly Prospect before us it pleased God to send a great Rain which was uni∣versal and has produced one of the most plentiful Harvests ever known in this Kingdom  ANOTHER Mercy for which we at this Time stand obliged to our Gracious Preser∣ver is that glorious Prospect of the Fruits of  the Earth springing up to supply our present great Necessity the Effect only of his Good∣ness  Ps lxviii  who sent a gracious Rain on his Inheri∣tance and refreshed it when it was weary  These are Blessings which we are now sensi∣ble of and which require our sincerest Thanks to the boutiful Giver Whom with all Hu∣mility we are to wait on for a Continuance of these Mercies trusting that he will finish what he hath begun that he will preserve us in our Dangers abroad and our Necessities at home that he will both  Ib exlvii  make Peace in our Borders and also fill us with the Flour of Wheat  THE best Method by which we can most reasonably hope to see our Desires answer'd to behold the Completion of these Blessings is gratefully to acknowledge those Instances of the Divine Goodness which were shewn to us heretofore Of these none more deserves our best and heartiest Thanks than the great Deliverance of this Day Which it is to be hop'd will be had in Remembrance as long as that Constitution shall last which was re∣establish'd by it  To remember this Mercy is not the Work of the Lips but of the Heart It is to re∣flect  with Seriousness upon it to learn how to value it and to look into every Circum∣stance that may help to shew us the true Va∣lue of itIt is to draw such Inferences from it that may direct our Practice and assist us in the several Duties of LifeTo entertain from thence just Notions of the Relations we bear to each other and of the Obligations arising from such Relations Particularly To learn from thence Obedience to the King and all that are put in Authority under him To en∣deavour to preserve the Peace and good Order of the Community in which we live To shew good Offices to our Friends and Neighbours and to bear a good Will towards all Men To restrain every inordinate and turbulent Passion in our Minds that may incline us to change or lead us beyond the Bounds of Equity Truth and Reason Above all To love and fear and honour him who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and to frequent the Ser∣vice of that Church which his Providence hath established in these Kingdoms  THE Blessing which we this Day stand so greatly indebted to Almighty God for is  The having put an end to the great Rebel∣lion by the Restitution of the King and Royal Family and the Restauration of the Go∣vernment after many Year's Interruption  To be sensible of the great Value of this Blessing we need only look into the History of that time and reflect on the Anarchy and Con∣fusion that then overspread the whole Nation  WHEN that Form of Government which was so agreeable to the Temper and Consti∣tution of the People and which was prov'd by the Experience of many Ages to be the best Method of preserving to them their Rights and Privileges nay which the Usur∣per himself confess'd to be the best Method of governing by instituting something of the like Kind I say when that excellent Form of Government was destroyed no Wonder that Disorder was the Consequence when  Judges xvii  there was no King in this our  Israel it is no mat∣ter of Amazement that  every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes  After that Effusion of noble Blood and the black un∣parallel'd Murder of the best of Kings how soon did Oppression spread its dark Wings over this unhappy Nation How soon were those deluded Men that were blindly led on by false and mischievous Guides made sensible of their Error And how quickly did they per∣ceive that That Liberty which they thirsted after even unto Blood was only made a po∣pular Pretence to reduce them to the most  abject SlaveryThus being grosly deceiv'd and by the most scandalous and false Repre∣sentations urged on through the most un∣warrantable means to seek Freedom did they plunge themselves into the very Gulph of Ty∣ranny and madly striving to depose one that was imaginary suffer'd themselves to be evil entreated by many real TyrantsWhat En∣vy Injustice and Bitterness of Heart was there in every Society What Malice Jealousy and Suspicion What Schemes and Designs What Plotting and Contrivance Each Faction by all the Methods and Arts that the most fiery Zeal could suggest striving for the Superio∣rity Professing Sincerity Meekness and Hu∣mility Full of Pride Rage and Perfidious∣nessFor how was the sacred Name of Re∣ligion then prostituted and the Honour and Service of God made a Cloak to palliate the most enormous Crimes made the Means not only of practising but justifying the most no∣torious Instances of Oppression and Cruelty Surely more flagrant Hypocrisy carried to greater Heights and attended with stronger Aggravations never yet appear'd in the World An Hypocrisy equal in every Circumstance and Character to that of the Pharisees and well deserving those severe  Matt xx ii  Denuntiations pronounced against it by the Mouth of Truth  THE faithful Loyalist in the mean while depriv'd of all Power all probable Means of assisting or bringing back the King could only shew his Affection towards him in good Wishes and Inclinations which the excessive Violence and Fury of the prevailing Party would not suffer to extend even to Words The Treachery of some compell'd him to con∣fine his Thoughts to his own Bosom as the Avarice and Rapine of others oblig'd him to conceal his Substance where it was most like∣ly to be secur'd How grievous an Heartbreaking must it have been to him to Every Man of old  English  Principles first to behold a Prince of so much Goodness rudely seiz'd on and inhumanly murder'd by his own Sub∣jects Then to see his Son and the rest of the royal Issue in their tender Years drove from the Kingdom The purest Christian Church overthrown and trampled on and private Property no better secured than by Faction and Opinion  IN this miserable Situation of Affairs some Attempts were made towards a Reestablish∣ment but without Success Alas All hu∣man Means were too weak to recover the Peace of the Kingdom to place so distracted a Government on its antient Basis Nothing  Matt xxiii  but the Hand of Providence could effect so mighty a Work and reconcile so many con∣tending Parties and jarring Opinions 'Twas not in the Arm of Flesh 'twas the Peculiar only of God to cause those  Ezek xxxvii  dry'd Bones to live  And it was he that did in his appoint∣ed Time renew a right Spirit within the Peo∣ple of this Nation That did  Ibid xi  take away the stony Heart out of their Flesh and give them an Heart of Flesh  'Twas thro' him alone that  Ibid xxxvi    This Land that was desolate did become like the Garden of  Eden  and the wast and ru∣in'd Cities become fenced and were inhabited  FOR this Cause therefore let us  Dan iv  praise and extol and honour the King of Heaven all whose Works are Truth and his Ways Judgment  Who did  Ps lxvi  suffer men to ride over our Heads  but at last  brought us out into a wealthy Place  Who in our Troubles and Adversities did turn and refresh us who remember'd us in our low Estate and turned away the Captivity of his PeopleIs there any one then among this People that will refuse to pay to Al∣mighty God his annual Tribute of Praise and Thanksgiving for so wonderful a Blessing The Man in whom the Return of this Day does not create Joy and raise a Spirit of Gra∣titude  would have look'd upon the Confusion that preceded the Restoration with Pleasure and Complacency And what a Friend to his Country such an one is like to prove the meanest Capacity may judge Every Satis∣faction we enjoy every new Acquisition we make every thing that is dear to us more especially our Religion and Liberties are de∣rived to us from thenceTo be insensible therefore of this Blessing were to act most ab∣surdly indeed were to indicate that we are even Enemies to our own selves  HE whose licentious Tongue instructed and directed by a wicked Heart can rail at object against and vilify the truly happy Day we are now remembring should consider if nothing else can stop his Virulence and De∣traction that he is obliged to that Day's Suc∣cess for the very Freedom of Speech he is pleas'd so intemperately to make use of  I KNOW not how far Men may be carried by their Humours and Passions How far an Affectation of Singularity may incline some how far a Spirit of Party may compel others and how far Indifference and the Distance of Time may be a Cause in more of omitting this their Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving but this may be said with some Degree of Assurance That no one who has  a due Regard for the Honour and Dignity of the Crown a tender Concern and temperate Zeal for the Established Church and an Heart glowing with the Love of Liberty that no one can consistently with these Principles neg∣lect his Duty on this Day and be blameless If a Man will be searching for Excuses the only possible Method by which he can requit himself in this Case is to doubt the Truth of the Fact A Scheme which may not seem so full of Absurdity if Scepticism in History be as flagrant as it is in Religion  Neither do I see with what Reason any one can insinuate himself into another's Fa∣vour by Misrepresentations of the important Transaction of that Day and by depreciating the Character of the King then restor'd With Men of honest and generous Principles it has ever been held a Mark of a mean spi∣rit to commend one Man by aspersing ano∣ther How much more then is it a sign of base Servitude to extol one Prince whose Virtues are too well known to need such low Helps at the Expence of debasing another who wore the same Crown before him It amounts to more than a Supposition that he who can be guilty of such Behaviour would at a fit Opportunity and under favourable Circum∣stances turn a vile Traitor and even whet  his Sword against the Gracious Sovereign now set over us As it is our Duty to pay the greatest Reverence to his sacred Person so let the Memory of the other be ever dear unto us Of Him who as on this Day return'd to his Kingdom with the universal Acclama∣tions of his People rejoicing with one Heart and united Hands to see their antient their best Constitution restor'd to behold once again the glorious Face of Monarchy Epis∣copacy and Liberty  IT has pleased God out of his abundant Mercy to prolong the Lives of some Persons who were Eyewitnesses of that happy Day even to these Times But had we no living Evidence of it were the Distance of Time much greater than it is yet a Mercy so signal and so excellent can never be forgotten by us We cannot without Forfeiture of our Rea∣son omit religiously observing a Day the joyful Effects of which we are every Mo∣ment sensible of More especially in this great and renown'd City which the rest of the Kingdom seem so industrious to copy af∣ter let this Day be ever held sacred It were to degenerate from the Spirit of our Ancestors not to acknowledge that Work with Joy which they were so sollicitous about and which under the Direction of Provi∣dence  they were so remarkably instrumental in bringing to pass  I WOULD use one Word more of Ex∣hortation which is That we take care to instil into those that come after the same Sense of this Mercy the same Spirit of Gratitude which we ourselves feel  Ps lxxviii  That Posterity may know it and the Children which are yet unborn to the intent that when they come up they may shew their Children the same  Josh iv  That when your Children ask their Fathers in Time to come  saying What meaneth this appointed Day and this solemn Thanksgiving That you shall let your Chil∣dren know saying This Land was defiled with Blood the antient and free Govern∣ment of this Kingdom was overthrown and destroy'd by wicked and bloodthirsty Men and the Lord delivered us from their Hands by a stretched out Arm  Ibid iv  That all the People of the Earth might know the Hand of the Lord it is mighty and that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever  THE Royal Psalmist who had so often ex∣perienced the merciful Goodness of the Lord some Passages of whose Life the History of this Day is exactly parallel to who was dri∣ven out of his Kingdom by ungrateful and  evilminded Men and return'd to it again with Joy and great Triumph will put a Song of Praise into the Mouth of every Man who has a just Sense of this Day's Mercy and reach him thus to express his Thanks for it to Almighty God  Ps cxlv  I WILL magnify thee  God my King and praise thy Name for ever  ever Every Day will I give thanks unto  and praise thy Name for ever and ever Great is the Lord and marvellous worthy to be prais'd there is no End of his Greatness  Ibid cxlvii  O sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving Sing Praises upon the Harp unto our God  Ps lxv  Who stille  the Raging of the Sea and the Noise of hi  Waves and the Madness of the People  Ibid cxlvii  Praise the Lord O Jerusalem praise thy God O Sion for he hath made fast the Bars of thy Gates and hath blessed thy Children within thee  Ps cxlv  My Mouth shall speak the Praise of the Lord and let all Flesh give Thanks unto his Holy Name for ever and ever  FINIS
