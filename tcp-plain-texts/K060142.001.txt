I  LONDON  Printed for J OSBORN S BIRT D BROWNE J HODGES A MILLAR J WHISTON and J ROBINSON MDCCXLII  PREFACE  _THE kind Reception which the last Edition of this Work has met with determined the Proprietors to spare no Expence to make the present as complete as the Nature of the Work would admit and the Editor in pursuance of their Intention has besides his own Observations and Experience been favour'd with such ample Materials by several curious Gentlemen as have made it impossible to comprize the Whole in Three Volumes as before altho' he omitted all that could be spared and abstracted whatever would bear it He was therefore obliged to add a Fourth Volume  And this he found himself under the greater Necessity of doing because wh  n he came to compare the former Edition with  his own Notes and the Maps he discovered many very material Omissions particularly that the whole County of  Hertford  was omitted excepting  St Albans  and one or two Villages as also the Isles of  Wight Portland Guernsey Jersey Alderney  and  Sarke  together with that of  Man  and the  Scots Isles  That the Description of the Northern Counties of  England  which abound with great Numbers of Remarkables was also very defective and That the first Author had directed his  Tour  in several Places in such a manner as to pass wholly by several of the best Towns and most remarkable Places and quite out of any Geographical Course or Order  Then the Materials which the Editor was supplied with for  Scotland  he found would swell that Part of the United Kingdom to one intire Volume which before made not half a one and he was glad of the Opportunity of doing some further Justice to that Country which has generally been slightly considered by those who know little of it  It must also be observed that the first Author had in many Places disclaimed Antiquities as a Subject out of his Province Whereas we have thought  ourselves obliged so far as our Limits would permit to take Notice of such as still remaining may be considered as a Part of the Present State of the Counties and Places where at this Day they continue visible and which may moreover merit the Attention of a curious Traveller and particularly of such Antiquities as have been brought to Light since the last Edition of  Camden  's  Britannia    For the above Reason we have been pretty ample in our Accounts of the famous  Stonehenge  and the Barrows in  Wilts  and confess our Obligations on this Head to the Learned Dr  Stukeley  in his late Work on that Subject to whom we are also beholden in several other Places  We have likewise thought ourselves obliged to take Notice of the Benefits which several Port and Trading Towns in this Kingdom as well in its Northern as Southern Parts have of late Years received from Acts of Parliament for inlarging and restoring of Piers and Harbours Repairs of Roads and for making Rivers navigable where the Face of Affairs in their particular Neighbourhoods have been any way altered or effected by those laudable Works  We have moreover subjoined to this Edition Lists of the Cities and Boroughs which return Members to the Parliament of  Great Britain  the Lists of such Gentlemens Seats in each County as we had not room to describe likewise a brief Account of the  English  Bishopricks and Lists of the Peers of  England  and  Scotland  in such a manner as will not be subject to any other Variations than that of the total Extinction of Families for our Intention was to carry this Piece as much as the Nature of the Work would admit beyond the Reach of temporary Fluctuations and Changes  By what we have said it will appear that this will have the Face of a new Work and indeed more than the  Face  as will be seen by any who will take the Pains to compare the different Editions and that therefore it was impossible to print by themselves for the Use of the Purchasers of the last Edition those new Observations Descriptions and Corrections which are incorporated in the present as the Proprietors were very desirous to have done had it been practicable But this we may venture to promise that tho' the Nature of this Work is such that there must be always Room for Additions  c  as new Discoveries may be made or Alterations happen by Time yet that all such necessary Alterations and Additions shall for the future be printed by themselves after the manner of the  Appendix  to VOL III of this Edition that the Reader may not be under the Necessity of repurchasing the whole Work  But lest it should be imagined from any thing we have said above that we have been so ungenerous as to endeavour to raise a Merit to the present Edition at the Expence of the former we shall observe That the good Reception which the Labours of the Original Author met with in his first Edition and which also attended the second which was printed with very great Additions and Improvements is no bad Argument of the Value of his Performance And indeed  He  well deserved that Success who could with Justice give such an Account of his Abilities for the Undertaking as is contained in the following Paragraphs  'The Preparations for this Work says he have been suitable to the Author's earnest Concern for its Usefulness Seventeen very large Circuits or Journeys have been taken thro' divers Parts separately and Three general Tours over  almost the whole  English  Part of the Island in all which the Author has not been wanting to treasure up just Remarks upon particular Places and Things so that he is very little in Debt to other Mens Labours and gives but very few Accounts of Things but what he has been an Eyewitness of himself  'Besides these several Journeys in  England  he has also lived some time in  Scotland  and has travelled critically over great Part of it He has viewed the North Part of  England  and the South Part of  Scotland  Five several times over All which is hinted here to let the Readers know what Reason they have to be satisfy'd with the Authority of the Relation and that the Accounts here given are not the Produce of a cursory View or raised upon the borrow'd Lights of other Observers'  We shall only add That if the First Edition had all these Advantages we may very safely submit the Merit of the present to the Judgment of the candid Reader  A TOUR Through the ISLAND of GREAT BRITAIN  LETTER I A  DESCRIPTION  of Part of the County of  ESSEX  and of the County of  SUFFOLK  c  SIR  _I SET out from  London  on my first Journey Eastward and took a  Circuit  down by the Coast of the  Thames  thro' the Marshes or Hundreds on the South side of the County of  Essex  to  Malden Colchester  and  Harwich  thence continuing on the Coast of  Suffolk  to  Yarmouth  thence round by the Edge of the Sea on the North and Westside of  Norfolk  to  Lynn Wisbich  and the  Wash  thence back again on the  Northside of  Suffolk  thence into the County of  Cambridge  and so to the Westpart of  Essex  ending it in  Middlesex  near the Place where I began reserving the Middle or Centre of the several Counties to some little Excursions which I made by themselves  Passing  BowBridge  where the County of  Essex  begins I came first to the Village of  Stratford  which is greatly increased of late Years in Houses and Inhabitants every Vacancy being filled up in a manner with the Addition of two little newbuilt Hamlets  as they may be called  on the Forestside of the Town namely  MarylandPoint  and the  GravelPits  one facing the Road to  Woodford  and  Epping  and the other that to  Ilford  As for the Hitherpart it is almost joined to  Bow  in spite of Rivers Canals Marshygrounds  c  The same Increase of Buildings may be seen proportionally in the other Villages adjacent especially on the Forestside as at  LowLayton Laytonstone Walthamstow Woodford Wansted  and the Towns of  WestHam Plaistow Upton  c and this generally speaking of handsome large Houses from  l  to  l  a Year being chiefly the Habitations of the richest Citizens such as are able to keep a Country as well as a Town House or such as have left off Trade altogether This is so apparent that they tell me there are no less than Two hundred Coaches kept by the Inhabitants within the Circumference of the few Villages named above besides such as are kept by accidental Lodgers the Cause of which I shall inlarge upon when I come to speak of the like in the Counties of  Middlesex Surrey  c where there will be still more Occasion to take notice of it  There have been discerned within these few Years in the Bottom of  HackneyMarsh  between  Oldford  and the  Wyck  the Remains of a great Stone Causeway  which is supposed to have been the Highway or great Road from  London  to  Essex  instead of that which now leads over the Bridge between  Bow  and  Stratford    That the great Road lay this Way and that the great Causeway continu'd just over the River where now the  TempleMills  stand and passed by Sir  Henry Hickes  's House at  Ruckholls  is not at all doubted and that it was one of those famous Highways made by the  Romans  there is undeniable Proof by the several Marks of  Roman  Work and by  Roman  Coins and other Antiquities found there some of which were collected by the late Reverend Mr  Strype  Vicar of  LowLayton    From hence the great Road passed up to  Laytonstone  a Place by some known now as much by the Sign of the  GreenMan  formerly a Lodge upon the Edge of the Forest and crossing by  Wanstedhouse  the noble Seat of Earl  Tilney  of which hereafter went over the same River which we now cross at  Ilford  and passing that Part of the great Forest called  HenaultForest  came into the present great Road a little on this side the  Whalebone  a Place so called because a Ribbone of a large Whale taken in the River of  Thames  the Year that  Oliver Cromwell  died was fixed there  According to my first Intention of effectually viewing the Seacoasts of  Essex Suffolk  and  Norfolk  I went from  Stratford  to  Barking  a large Markettown but chiefly inhabited by Fishermen whose Smacks ride in the  Thames  at the Mouth of  Barking  Creek from whence their Fish are sent up to  London  to the Market at  Billingsgate  in small Boats  These FishingSmacks are very useful Vessels to the Publick upon many Occasions as particularly in time of War they are used as Presssmacks running to all the Northern and Western Coasts to pick  up Seamen to man the Navy when any Expedition is at hand that requires a sudden Equipment At other times being excellent Sailors they are Tenders to particular Men of War and on an Expedition they have been made use of as Machines for the blowing up fortified Ports as formerly at  St Malo  and other Places  The Parish of  Barking  is very large and by the Improvement of Lands recovered out of the  Thames  and out of the River which runs by the Town the great and small Tithes as the Townsmen assured me are worth above  l per Annum  This Parish has two Chapels of Ease  viz  one at  Ilford  and one on the side of the Forest called  Newchapel    A little beyond the Town on the Road to  Dagenham  stood a great old House where Tradition says the  GunpowderTreason  was contrived and where all the first Consultations about it were held  This Side of the County is rather rich from the Nature of its Land than from the Number of its Inhabitants which is occasioned by the Unhealthiness of the Air for these low Marsh Grounds which with all the Southside of the County have been gained as it were out of the River  Thames  and the Sea where the River is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather at  WestHam  by  Stratford  and extend themselves from hence Eastward growing wider till we come beyond  Tilbury  when the flat Country lies six seven or eight Miles in Breadth and is both unhealthy and unpleasant  However it is very good Farming in the Marshes because the Landlords let good Penyworths tho' the Land is rich for it being a Place where every body cannot live those that venture it will have Encouragement and it is but reasonable they should  In passing from  Barking  to  Dagenham  we saw the Place where was the famous Breach that laid near Acres of Land under Water but which after near ten Years Inundation and the Works being several times blown up was at last effectually stopped by Captain  Perry  who for several Years had been employed in the Czar of  Muscovy  's Works at  Veronitza  on the River  Don    Great Part of the Lands in these Levels especially those on this side  EastTilbury  are held by the Farmers Cowkeepers and Grasingbutchers who live in and near  London  who generally stock them with  Lincolnshire  and  Leicestershire  Wethers which they buy in  Smithfield  in  September  and  October  when the Grasiers sell off their Stocks and feed here till  Christmas  or  Candlemas  and tho' they are not made much the fatter here than when bought in yet very good Advantage accrues by the Difference of the Price of Mutton between  Michaelmas  when cheapest and  Candlemas  when dearest and this is what the Butchers call by way of Excellence  right Marsh Mutton    At the End of these Marshes close to the Edge of the River stands  Tilburyfort  which may justly be looked upon as the Key of the City of  London  It is a regular Fortification the Design of it was a a Pentagon but the Waterbastion as it would have been called was never built the Plan was laid out by Sir  Martin Beckman  chief Engineer to King  Charles  II who also designed the Works at  Sheerness  The Esplanade of the Fort is very large and the Bastions the largest of any in  England  The Foundation is laid upon Piles driven down two an end of one another so far till they were assured they were below the Chanel of the River and that the Piles which were pointed with Iron entered into the solid Chalkrock adjoining to the Chalkhills on the other side  The Works to the Landside are complete the Bastions are faced with Brick There is a double Ditch or Moat the innermost of which is Feet broad a good Counterscarp and a Covered Way marked out with Ravelins and Tenailles but they have not been completed  On the Landside there are also two small Redoubts of Brick but the chief Strength of this Fort on the Landside consists in being able to lay the whole Level under Water and so to make it impossible for an Enemy to carry on Approaches that way  On the Side next the River is a very strong Curtain with a noble Gate called the  Watergate  in the Middle and the Ditch is palisado'd At the Place where the Waterbastion was designed to be built and which by the Plan should run wholly out into the River so to flank the two Curtains on each side stands a high Tower which they tell us was built in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time and was called the  Blockhouse  the Side next the Water is vacant  Before this Curtain above and below the said Vacancy is a Platform in the place of a Counterscarp on which are planted Cannon generally carrying from to Pound Ball a Battery so terrible as well imports the Consequence of that Place besides which there are smaller Pieces planted between and the Bastions and Curtain also are planted with Guns so that they must be bold Fellows who will venture in the biggest Ships to pass such a Battery if the Men appointed to serve the Guns do their Duty as becomes them  From hence there is nothing for many Miles together remarkable but a continued Level of unhealthy Marshes called  The three Hundreds  till we come before  Leigh  and to the Mouth of the Rivers  Chelmer  and  Blackwater  saving that the Towns of  Horndon Rayley  and  Rochford  lie near  the Seacoast extending in the order I have named but are of no Note The above Rivers united make a large Firth or Inlet of the Sea which our Fishermen and Seamen who use it as a Port call  Maldenwater    In this Inlet is  Osey  or  Osyth  Island so well known by our  London  Men of Pleasure for producing such vast Numbers of WildDucks Mallards Teals and Wigeons that the Island seems covered with them at certain Times of the Year and they go from  London  for the Pleasure of Shooting and often come home very well loaden with Game and sometimes too with an  Essex  Ague on their Backs which they find a heavier Load than the Fowls they have shot  On the Shore beginning a little below  Candy Island  or  Leigh Road  lies a great Shoal or Sand called the  Black Tayl  which runs out near three Leagues into the Sea due East at the End of it stands a Pole or Mast set up by the  Trinityhouse  of  London  as a Seamark this is called  Shoebeacon  from the Point of Land where this Sand begins which is called  Shoeberryness  from a Town of that Name which stands by it From this Sand and on the Edge of  Shoeberry  before it or Southwest of it all along to the Mouth of  Colchesterwater  the Shore is full of Shoals and Sands with some deep Chanels between all which are so full of Fish that the  Barking  Smacks are well employed here and the Shore swarms besides with small Fisherboats belonging to the Villages and Towns on the Coast which come in every Tide with what they take and selling the smaller Fish in the Country send the best and largest upon Horses which travel Night and Day to  London  Market  On this Shore also are taken the best and most relishing tho' not the largest Oysters in  England  The Spot from whence they have their Appellation is a little Bank called  Woelfleet  in the Mouth of the  River  Crouch  called  Crookseawater  but the chief Place where these Oysters are now had is from  Wyvenhoe  and the Shores adjacent whither they are brought by the Fishermen who take them at the Mouth of  Colchesterwater  and about the Sand they call the  Spits  and carry them up to  Wyvenhoe  where they are laid in Beds or Pits on the Shore to feed as they call it and then being barrelled up and carried to  Colchester  which is but three Miles off they are sent to  London  by Land and are from thence called  Colchester  Oysters  They take also here fine Soals which generally yield a good Price at  London  Market also sometimes middling Turbut with Whitings Codling and large Flounders  In the several Creeks and Openings on this Shore are also other Islands but of no great Note except  Mersey  which lies between the two Openings of  Maldenwater  and  Colchesterwater  and is a Place of such difficult Access that 'tis thought a thousand Men might keep Possession of it against a great Force whether by Land or Sea On this account and because if possessed by an Enemy it would shut up all the Navigation and Fishery on that Side a Fort was built on the Southeast Point of it and generally in a  Dutch  War a strong Garison is kept there to defend it  At this Place may be said to end what we call the  Three Hundreds  of  Essex  which include the marshy Country  viz Barstable  Hundred  Rochester  Hundred and  Dengy  Hundred  One thing deserves mention here which is That all along this County it is very frequent to meet with Men that have had from Five or Six to Fourteen or Fifteen Wives and I was informed that in the Marshes overagainst  Candy Island  was a Farmer who was then living with the fiveandtwentieth and that his Son who was but Thirtyfive  Years old had already had about Fourteen Indeed this Part of the Story I only had by Report tho' from good Hands but the other is well known and will be attested about  Fobbing Curringham Thundersly Benfleet Prittlewell Wakering Great Stambridge Cricksea Burnham Dengy  and other Towns of the like Situation the Reason as a merry Fellow told me who said he had had about a Dozen was this That they being bred in the Marshes themselves and seasoned to the Place did pretty well but that they generally chose to leave their own Lasses to their Neighbours out of the Marshes and went into the Uplands for a Wife That when they took the young Women out of the wholsome fresh Air they were clear and healthy but when they came into the Marshes among the Fogs and Damps they presently changed Complexion got an Ague or two and seldom held it above half a Year or a Year at most And then said he we go to the Uplands again and fetch another So that marrying of Wives was reckoned a kind of good Farm to them Nor do the Men in these Parts hold it out as in other Countries for we seldom meet with very ancient People among the Poor insomuch that hardly one half of the Inhabitants are Natives of the Place but such as come from other Parts for the Advantage of good Farms  From the Marshes and low Grounds being not able to travel without many Windings and Indentures by reason of the Creeks and Waters I came up to the antient Town of  Malden  situate at the Conflux of two principal Rivers the  Chelmer  and the  Blackwater  where they enter into the Sea It is built in the Form of a Cross is a Liberty in itself and has a convenient Haven for Ships it consists of one Street near a Mile long besides Lanes  c  It is governed by Two Bailiffs Aldermen Steward Recorder  c  Here is a good publick Library for  the Use of the Minister and the Clergy of the Hundreds adjoining to the Sea and any Gentleman may borrow a Book upon depositing the Value of it  The Chanel called  Maldenwater  is navigable to the Town where by that means is a great Trade for carrying Corn by Water to  London  the County of  Essex  being especially on that Side a great Corn Country King  Edward the Elder  resided here whilst he built the Town and Castle of  Witham  in this County and also  Hertford  Castle  Malden  was a  Roman  Colony which  Camden  diffidently conjectures to be the antient  Camalodunum  But Mr  Salmon  will have it to be the  Villa Faustini  which has been so long attributed to  St Edmund'sbury  but however that be it was here the  Britons  under the valiant Queen  Boadicea  cut in Pieces the tenth Legion killed above  Romans  and destroyed the Colony but she was afterwards overthrown herself in a great Battle  Britons  slain and herself and Daughters most inhumanly treated and disgraced by those great Reformers of the World who in her Case forgot not only the Honour due to the Sex but that which the truly Brave shew to the Brave in Misfortune  Being obliged to come thus far into the Uplands I made it my Road to pass thro'  Witham  built as I mentioned by  Edward the Elder  'Tis a pleasant wellsituated Markettown in which and in its Neighbourhood are many Gentlemen of good Fortunes and Families  Nearer  Chelmsford  hard by  Boreham  is the famous Seat of  Beaulieu  in which King  Henry  VIII very much delighted It is the largest Edifice in the County next  Audleyend  where lived the late Lord Viscount  Barrington  who had the Advantage to be twice made Heir to the Estates of Gentlemen not at all related to him at least one of them as is mentioned in his Patent of Creation He changed  the Name of  Shute  for that of  Barrington  by an Act of Parliament and had the Dignities of a Baron and Viscount of  Ireland  conferred on him by K  Geo  I  The Product of all this Part of the Country is Corn as that of the marshy feeding Grounds is Grass where their chief Business is breeding of Calves which I need not say are the best and fattest and the largest Veal in  England  if not in the World  Kelvedon  or as it is commonly called  Keldon  lies within three Miles of  Witham  which as it is said derives its Name from  KillDane  the Massacre of the  Danes  being begun here by the Women but as neither Mr  Camden  nor any Author of Credit mentions it I think the Story is not to be heeded  Colchester  the  Iciani  of the  Romans  according to Mr  Salmon  is pleasantly situated upon an Eminence above the River  Coln  It is a large and populous Town adorned with handsome Streets and tho' it cannot be said to be finely built yet there are abundance of good Houses in it In the Conclusion of the late Civil War it suffered a severe Siege which as it made a resolute Defence was turned into a Blockade wherein the Garison and Inhabitants also suffered the utmost Extremity of Hunger and were at last obliged to surrender at Discretion when their two chief Officers Sir  Charles Lucas  and Sir  George Lisle  were shot to Death under the Castlewall  The battered Walls the Breaches in the Turrets and the ruined Churches still shew Marks of this Siege except that the Church of  St Mary  where they had the Royal Fort is rebuilt but the Steeple which was Twothirds battered down the Besieged having a large Culverin upon it which did much Execution remains still in that Condition  The Lines of Contravallation which surrounded the whole Town and the Forts of the Besiegers remain very visible in many Places  The River  Coln  which passes through the Town encompasses it on the North and East and served in Times of War for a complete Defence on those Sides There are three Bridges over it and it is navigable within three Miles of the Town for Ships of large Burden a little lower it may receive even a Royal Navy and up to that Part called the  Hithe  close to the Houses it is navigable for Hoys and small Barks for which it is indebted to three Acts of Parliament passed for that purpose one in the Reign of King  William  III one in that of King  George  I and the other in that of King  George  II  This  Hithe  is a long Street passing from West to East on the Southside of the Town and is so populous towards the River that it may be called  The Wapping of Colchester  There is one Church in that Part of the Town a large Quay by the River and a good Customhouse  The Town chiefly subsists by the Trade of making Bays tho' indeed all the Towns around carry on the same Trade as  Kelvedon Witham Coggshall Braintree Bocking  c and the whole County large as it is may be said to be employed and in Part maintained by the Spinning of Wool for the BayTrade of  Colchester  and its adjacent Towns  The Town of  Colchester  has been supposed to contain about People including the Outvillages within its Liberty of which there are a great many the Liberty of the Town being of a large Extent The Government is by a Mayor HighSteward a Recorder or his Deputy Eleven Aldermen a Chamberlain a Townclerk Assistants and Eighteen Commoncouncilmen  There are in  Colchester  Eight Churches besides those which are damaged and Five Meetinghouses whereof two for Quakers besides one  Dutch  and one  French  Church Its other publick Edifices are    Bayhall  where the Goodness of the Manufacture of Bays made in this Town is ascertained by a Corporation established for this Purpose consisting of a Set of Men called Governors of the  Dutch Bayhall    The  Guildhall  of the Town called by them the  Moothall  contiguous to which is the Towngaol  The  Workhouse  for the Poor which has been inlarged of late Years  A Grammar Freeschool which has good Allowance to the Master who is chosen by the Town    The Castle of Colchester  is a Monument of the Antiquity of the Place it being built as the Walls of the Town also are with  Roman  Bricks and the  Roman  Coins dug up here and ploughed up in the Fields adjoining confirm it The Inhabitants boast much that  Helena  the Mother of  Constantine the Great  first Christian Emperor of the  Romans  was born there but it would be hard to make it out and indeed were it our Business we could produce strong Proofs to the contrary Mr  Camden  says That this Castle was in his Time ready to fall with Age and yet it has stood above Years since and perhaps is not much worse than it was then altho' it received several Cannon Shot in the last Siege of the Town which made no Impression upon it as the Besiegers found and therefore left off firing against it and the rather as the Garison made no great Use of it against them The Queen's Head in the Marketplace and the Stable are also  Roman  Buildings There was likewise a  Roman  Military Way from  Colchester  by  Braintree Dunmow  and farther that Way  There are two CHARITYSCHOOLS set up here and carried on by a generous Subscription with very good Success  From  Colchester  I took a Turn down to the Coast The Land running out a great way into the Sea South and Southeast makes that Promontory  of Land called the  Nase  wellknown to Seamen who use the Northern Trade Here one sees a Sea open as an Ocean without any opposite Shore tho' it be no more than the Mouth of the  Thames  This Point called the  Nase  and the Northeast Point of  Kent  near  Margate  called the  NorthForeland  make the Mouth of the River and the Port of  London  tho' it be here above Miles over  But as it is pretended by some that according to the present Usage of the  Customhouse  the Port of  London  is not allowed to extend so far 'tis thought proper to insert the Clause taken from the Act of Parliament establishing the Extent of that Port  "To prevent all future Differences and Disputes touching the Extent and Limits of the Port of  London  the said Port is declared to extend and be accounted from the Promontory or Point called the  NorthForeland  in the Isle of  Thanet  and from thence Northward in a right Line to the Point called the NASE beyond the  Gunfleet  upon the Coast of  Essex  and so continued Westward throughout the River  Thames  and the several Chanels Streams and Rivers falling into it to  Londonbridge  saving the usual and known Rights Liberties and Privileges of the Ports of  Sandwich  and  Ipswich  and either of them and the known Members thereof and of the Customers Comptrollers Searchers and their Deputies of and within the said Ports of  Sandwich  and  Ipswich  and the several Creeks Harbours and Havens to them or either of them respectively belonging within the Counties of  Kent  and  Essex  "  Notwithstanding which the Port of  London  as in Use since the said Order is understood to reach no farther than  Gravesend  in  Kent  and  Tilburypoint  in  Essex  and the Ports of  Rochester Milton  and  Feversham  belong to the Port of  Sandwich    In like manner the Ports of  Harwich Colchester Wyvenhoe Malden Leigh  c are said to be Members of the Port of  Ipswich    This Observation may suffice for what is needful to be said upon the same Subject when I come to speak of the Port of  Sandwich  and its Members and their Privileges with respect to  Rochester Milton Feversham  c in my Circuit thro' the County of  Kent    At  Walton  under the  Nase  they find on the Shore Copperasstones in great Quantities and there are several large Works called Copperashouses where 'tis made with great Expence  On the  NorthForeland  is a new Mark erected by the  Trinityhouse  Men at the publick Expence being a round Brick Tower near Feet high The Sea gains so much upon the Land here by the continual Winds at Southwest that within the Memory of some of the Inhabitants above Acres of Land have been lost in one Place  From hence we go back into the County about four Miles because of the Creeks which lie between and turning East again come to  Harwich  on the utmost Eastern Point of this large County  Harwich  is a Town strong by Situation and may be made more so by Art The Harbour or Road is one of the securest in  England  and covered at the Entrance by  Landguardfort  and a Battery of Guns to the Seaward just as at  Tilbury  and which sufficiently defend the Mouth of the River Tho' the Entrance or Opening of the River into the Sea is very wide especially at Highwater at least two Miles if not three over yet the Chanel in which the Ships must keep and come to the Harbour is deep narrow and lies only on the Side of the Fort so that all the Ships  which come in or go out must come within Gunshot of the Fort  The Fort is on the  Suffolk  Side of the Bay but stands so far into the Sea upon the Point of a Sand or Shoal running out towards the  Essex  Side that in a manner it covers the Mouth of the Haven and our Surveyors of the Country affirm it to be in the County of  Essex  The making this Place which was formerly no other than a Sand in the Sea solid enough for the Foundation of so good a Fortification cost many Years Labour frequent Repairs and a prodigious Expence but 'tis now so firm that neither Storms nor Tides affect it  The Harbour is of a vast Extent for the River  Stour  from  Maningtree  and River  Orwel  from  Ipswich  empty themselves here and the Chanels of both are large and deep and safe for all Weathers and where they join they make a large Bay or Road able to receive the biggest Ships of War and the greatest Number that ever the World saw together In the  Dutch  War great Use was made of this Harbour and there have been Sail of Men of War with their Attendants and between and Sail of Colliers all riding in it at a time with great Safety and Convenience  Harwich  is the Port where the Packetboats between  England  and  Holland  go out and come in the Inhabitants are far from being famed for good Usage to Strangers but on the contrary are esteemed a little extravagant in their Reckonings in the Publickhouses this has encouraged the setting up of Sloops which they now call Passageboats to go directly from the River of  Thames  to  Holland  tho' the Passage may be something longer yet the Masters of the Sloops are said to be more obliging to Passengers and more reasonable in the Expence and the Vessels good Seaboats  Harwich  has been a Sufferer on this Account  The People of  Harwich  boast that their Town is walled and their Streets paved with Clay and yet that one is as strong and the other as clean as those that are built or paved with Stone The Fact is indeed true for there is a sort of Clay in the Cliff between the Town and the Beaconhill adjoining which when it falls down into the Sea where it is beaten with the Waves and the Weather turns gradually into Stone But the chief Reason assigned is from the Water of a certain Spring or Well which rising in the Cliff runs down into the Sea among those Pieces of Clay and petrifies them as it runs and the Force of the Sea often stirring and perhaps turning the Lumps of Clay when Storms of Wind may give Force enough to the Water causes them to harden everywhere alike otherwise those which were not quite sunk in the Water of the Spring would be petrify'd but in part These Stones are gathered up to pave the Streets and build the Houses and are indeed very hard 'Tis also remarkable that some of them taken up before they are thoroughly petrify'd will upon breaking them appear to be hard as a Stone without and soft as Clay in the Middle whereas others that have lain a due time shall be thorough Stone to the Centre and full as hard within as without The same Spring is said to turn Wood into Iron but this I take to be no more or less than the Quality which as I mentioned of the Shore at the  Ness  is found to be in much of the Stone along this Shore of the Copperas Kind and 'tis certain that the  Copperasstone  so called is found in all that Cliff and even where the Water of this Spring has run and I presume that those who call the hardened Pieces of Wood which they take out of this Well by the Name of Iron never tried the Quality of it with the Fire or Hammer if they had it is not unlikely that they would have given some other Account of it  On the Promontory of Land which they call  Beaconhill  which lies beyond or behind the Town toward the Sea is a Lighthouse to give the Ships Direction in their sailing by as well as their coming into the Harbour at Night  This Town was formerly fortify'd but in the Reign of King  Charles  I the Fortifications were demolished It has since been ordered to be fortify'd again and Ground has been bought accordingly to the King's Use by Act of Parliament but there is nothing more done in it yet and indeed it is many Years since the Government having a better Security in the  British  Shipping have had Occasion to fortify Towns to the Landward  It was incorporated in the th of  Edward  II The  Harwich  Men pretended a Grant from  Edw  III to take Customduties for Goods coming into the Haven till on a Complaint made by the Town of  Ipswich  that it was an Infringement upon their Liberties an Inquisition was appointed by that Prince at  Ipswich  in the th of his Reign by which it was determined against  Harwich  in favour of  Ipswich    Harwich  after all may be said to be a neat clean wellbuilt Town enjoys a good Maritime Trade is governed by a Mayor  c  has a Market every  Tuesday  and  Friday  and two annual Fairs one on  Mayday  the other on  October  the th  Landguardfort  was built in the Reign of King  James  I and was a much more considerable Fortification than at present having had four Bastions named the  King's  the  Queen's Holland's  and  Warwick's  mounted with very large Guns particularly those on the Royal  Bastion  where the King's Standard was display'd which would throw a Pound Ball over  Harwich  and it had a constant Garison with a Chapel and many Houses for the Governor Gunners and other Officers But it has been demolished and a small Platform made instead  of it by the Waterside but yet as the particular Current of the Chanel which Ships must keep in as I have said obliges them to pass just by the Fort the Harbour is sufficiently defended on the Seaside from sudden Invasion  And now being at the Extremity of the County of  Essex  of which I have given you some View as to that Side next the Sea only I shall conclude this Part of my Circuit by telling you that I will take the Towns which lie more towards the Centre of the County in my Return by the North and West Part that I may give you a few Hints of some Towns which were near me in my Rout this way  On the Road from  London  to  Colchester  before I came into it at  Witham  lie four good Markettowns at near equal Distance from one another  viz Rumford Brentwood Ingatstone  and  Chelmsford Rumford  stands first and is noted for two Markets one for Calves and Hogs the other for Corn and other Provisions mostly bought up for  London  Market  At the farther End of this Town in the Middle of a stately Park stood  Guldyhall  vulgarly  Giddyhall  an antient Seat of one Sir  Thomas Coke  LordMayor of  London Anno  in the Reign of  Edward  IV whose great Riches being his principal Crime exposed him in bad Times to so great Sufferings that tho' he was acquitted by the Integrity of his Judge of the Crimes laid to his Charge yet he was fined to the Value very nearly of his whole Estate It is since pulled down to the Ground and there now stands a stately Mansionhouse built upon the Spot by Sir  John Eyles  lately LordMayor of  London    Brentwood  and  Ingatstone  are two others and are large thoroughfare Towns full of good Inns chiefly maintained by the Multitude of Carriers and  Passengers constantly passing this Way to  London  with Droves of Cattle Provisions and Manufactures  Chelmsford  is the th chiefly supported by the fame Business It is the Countytown where the Assizes are often held and stands on the Conflux of two Rivers the  Chelmer  whence the Town derives its Name and the  Cann  and has a good Freeschool belonging to it  Southeast of  Brentwood  lies  Billiricay  a pretty considerable Markettown  Near  Chelmsford  stands a Seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of  Fitzwalter  which is seen on the Lefthand of the Road just before you enter the Town The House is large and hath been lately new fronted so that it makes a handsome Appearance There are also several new Plantations about it and in time if his Lordship continues his Design of improving it it will become a fine Seat  I shall take notice in my Return through these Parts of the noble Seat of the Lord  Petre  and his Lordship's great Improvements in this County  At  Lees  or  Lee'sPriory  as some call it is to be seen an antient House in the Middle of a beautiful Park formerly the Seat of the Duke of  Manchester  but after the Death of the Duke it was sold to the Duchess Dowager of  Buckinghamshire  and since purchased by Mr  Hoare    Five Markettowns fill up the rest of this Part of the Country  Dunmow Braintree Thaxted Halsted  and  Coggshall  all noted for the Manufacture of Bays But  Dunmow  I must particularly mention on account of its famous old Story of its Flitch of Bacon which is this  One  Robert Fitzwalter  a powerful Baron in this County in the Time of  Henry  III instituted a Custom in the Priory here That  whatever married Man did not repent of his being married or differ and  dispute with his Wife within a Year and a Day after his Marriage and would swear to the Truth of it kneeling upon two hard pointed Stones in the  Priory Churchyard  set up for that Purpose in Presence of the Prior and Convent such Person should have a Flitch of Bacon    This has been actually claimed and received as appears by Record there but the Priory being dissolved there is an End of the Flitch and it were well if no worse Consequence had attended the Dissolution of Religious Houses For as there was no Danger of many Claimants there were the fewer to regret the Loss  Of  Braintree  and  Bocking  I shall take notice in my Return to  London    Formerly 'tis thought the Forests of  Epping  and  Henault  took up all the South Part of the County but particularly we are assured that it reached to the River  Chelmer  and into  Dengy  Hundred and from thence again West to  Epping  and  Waltham  where it continues to be a Forest still  Probably that of  Epping  has been a Weald or Forest ever since this Island has been inhabited and may shew us in some Parts of it  where Inclosures and Tillage have not broke in upon it  what the general Face of this Island was before the  Romans  landed in  Britain    The Constitution of this Forest is best seen as to its Antiquity by the pleasant Grant of it from  Edward the Confessor  before the  Norman  Conquest to  Randolph Peperking  one of his Favourites who was after called  Peverell  and whose Name remains still in several Villages in this County as particularly that of  Hatfield Peverell  in the Road from  Chelmsford  to  Witham  which is supposed to be originally a Park called a Field in those Days and  Hartfield  may be as much as to say a Park for Deer for the Stags were in those Days called  Harts    so that this was neither more nor less than  Randolph Peperking  's  Hartfield  or  Deerpark    This  Randolph  or  Ralph Peverell  had it seems a beautiful Lady to his Wife who was Daughter of  Ingelrick  one of  Edward the Confessor  's Noblemen He had two Sons by her  William Peverell  a famed Soldier and Lord or Governor of  Dovercastle  which he surrendered to  William the Conqueror  after the Battle in  Sussex  and  Pain Peverell  his youngest who was Lord of  Cambridge  When the eldest Son delivered up the Castle the Lady abovenamed was there and the Conqueror fell in Love with her and had a Son by her who was called  William  after the Conqueror's Christian Name but retained the Name of  Peverell  and was afterwards as History acquaints us created by the Conqueror Lord of  Nottingham    This Lady as is supposed by way of Penance for her Frailty founded a Nunnery at the Village of  HatfieldPeverell  mentioned above where she lies buried in the Parishchurch and her Memory is preserved by a Tombstone under one of the Windows The Grant I have mentioned being to be found in  Camden  I shall not transcribe it here  I shall now in pursuance of my first Design proceed to the County of  Suffolk    From  Harwich  therefore having a mind to view the Harbour I sent my Horses round by  Maningtree  a good but dirty Markettown where there is a Timberbridge over the  Stour  or as it is more usually called  Maningtreewater  and took a Boat for  Ipswich  up the River  Orwel  known best by the Name of  Ipswichwater  by which Passage from  Harwich  to  Ipswich  it is about twelve Miles  In a Creek in this River called  Lavingtoncreek  we saw at low Water such Shoals of Muscles tha  great Boats might have loaded with them and th  Quantity scarce diminished to the Eye Near this Creek Sir  Samuel Barnardiston  had a fine Seat as also a Decoy for wild Ducks and a very noble Estate but it is divided into many Branches since his Death  Ipswich  is seated at the Distance of Miles from  Harwich  upon the Edge of the River which takeing a short Turn to the West the Town forms there a kind of Semicircle or Halfmoon upon the Bank of the River It is very remarkable that tho' Ships of Tuns may upon a Springtide come up very near this Town and many Ships of that Burden have been built there yet the River is scarce navigable above the Town not even for the smallest Boats nor does the Tide which rises sometimes or Feet and gives them Feet Water very near the Town flow much farther up the River than the Town  No Place in  Britain  is qualified like  Ipswich  for carrying on the  Greenland  Fishery whether we respect the Cheapness of building and fitting out their Ships and Shalloops furnishing victualling and providing them with all kind of Stores Convenience for laying up the Ships after the Voyage Room for erecting their Magazines Warehouses Roapwalks Cooperages  e  on the easiest Terms and especially for the noisome Cookery which attends the boiling their Blubber which may be on this River remote from any Places of Resort then the Nearness to the Market for the Oil when it is made and which above all ought to be regarded the Conveniency that arises from this Consideration that the same Wind which carries them from the Mouth of the Haven is fair to the very Seas of  Greenland    Ipswich  was formerly much more considerable for Trade than at present but yet it may be accounted a very neat and wellbuilt Town and much larger than many Cities carries on still a considerable Maritime  Trade and tho' it is but thinly inhabited to what it has been yet whoever looks into the Churches and Meetinghouses of a  Sunday  will not even in this Particular think so meanly of it as some have done  It has a very spacious Marketplace in the midst of that is a fair Cross in which is the Cornmarket Adjoining is the Shambles or Butchery very commodious and vulgarly but erroneously supposed to have been built by Cardinal  Wolsey  for it owes its Original to a much later Date  viz  to the th Year of Queen  Elizabeth  Behind this is the Herbmarket and in a spacious Street a little distant is a Market for Butter Poultry and other Country Provisions and another for Fish with which the Town is served in great Plenty It has five Marketdays weekly  Tuesday  and  Thursday  for small Meat  Wednesday  and  Friday  for Fish and  Saturday  for all sorts of Provisions It has also five annual Fairs one on  April  one on  May  and one on  July  one on the th and th of  August  for Cattle also and the fifth on  September  which is a very considerable one for Butter and Cheese to which the whole Country round resort to furnish themselves with Winter Stores as do also many of the  London  Dealers in those Commodities who however are not suffered to buy till after the first three Days of the Fair  There are even now in this Town Parishchurches out of which there once were and two Chapels in the Corporationliberty out of several which have been demolished besides Meetinghouses  c  and it once abounded with Religious Houses which have yielded to the Fate of the Times  Here is also a fair Townhall with a spacious Councilchamber and other commodious Apartments a Shirehall where the County Sessions are  held for the Division of  Ipswich  a large publick Library adjoining to a noble Hospital founded by the Town called  Christ's Hospital  for the Maintenance of Poor Children old Persons Maniacks and in it Rogues Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars are kept to hard Labour Also adjoining to this is a good Freeschool and there is likewise the noble Foundation of Mr  Henry Tooly Anno  for poor old Men and Women  It is a Town Corporate governed by two Bailiffs a Recorder Portmen four of which besides the Bailiffs are Justices of the Peace two Coroners Commoncouncilmen who are also Highconstables and of them Headboroughs and Petty Constables  Its Privileges are extraordinary for the Bailiffs pass Fines and Recoveries hear and determine Causes as well Criminal as Civil arising in the Town and even Crown Causes preferably to any of his Majesty's Courts at  Westminster  They appoint the Assize of Bread Wine Beer  c  No Freeman can be obliged to serve on Juries out of the Town or bear any Offices for the King without his own Consent Sheriffs for the County excepted Nor are they obliged to pay any Tolls or Duties in any other Parts of the Kingdom having cast the City of  London  in a Trial at Law for Duties demanded by the City of Freemens Ships in the River  Thames  They are intitled to all Waifs Estrays  c  to all Goods cast on Shore within their AdmiraltyJurisdiction which extends on the Coast of  Essex  beyond  Harwich  and on both Sides the  Suffolk  Coast and their Bailiffs even hold their Admiraltycourt beyond  Landguard  Fort  c  And by a solemn Decision in their Favour by an Inquisition taken at  Ipswich  in the th of  Edward  III they carried the Point which  Harwich  contested with them of taking Customduties for Goods coming into  Harwich  Haven which was determined to belong solely to the Bailiffs and Burgesses of  Ipswich  as I before hinted In King  John  's Reign there was a Mint in this Town  I shall just mention in this Place tho' it be generally known that the famous Cardinal  Wolsey  Archbishop of  York  was born in this Town his Father being a Butcher in it tho' according to Dr  Fiddes  who published his Will he seems to have been a Man of Substance for those Times This Prelate rose to the highest Pitch of Honour and Grandeur that it was possible for a Subject to attain to and was suddenly stripped of all having been cast in a Praemunire whereby he incurr'd a Forfeiture of all his Effects and Preferments and being afterwards pardoned and restored to some Part thereof particularly to the Archbishoprick of  York  he was arrested for HighTreason at his Archiepiscopal Palace at  Cawood  in  Yorkshire  and died at  Leicester  Abbey as he was carrying to  London  where he was buried  The  French  Refugees when they first came over to  England  began a little to take to this Place and some Merchants attempted to set up a Linen Manufacture in their Favour but it did not meet with the expected Success and at present I find very little of it The poor People are however employ'd as they are all over those Counties in spinning Wooll for other Towns where Manufactures are settled  The Country round  Ipswich  as are all the Counties so near the Coast is applied chiefly to Corn of which a very great Quantity is continually shipped off for  London  and sometimes they load Corn here for  Holland  especially if the Market abroad is encouraging  There is a great deal of very good Company in this Town and tho' here are not so many of the Gentry as at  Bury  yet it has more than any other Town in the County  I take this Town to be one of the most agreeable Places in  England  for Families who have lived well but may be reduced to live within a narrow Compass for  Here are good Houses at very easy Rents  An airy clean and wellgovern'd Town  Very agreeable and improving Company almost of every Kind  Plenty of all Manner of Provisions whether Fish or Flesh very good of the Kind and very cheap  Easy Passage to  London  either by Land or Water the Coach going thro' to  London  in a Day  The Lord Viscount  Hereford  had a very fine Seat and Park in this Town the House indeed was built in the antient Taste but very commodious 'tis called  Christchurch  and had been a Priory or Religious House in former Times The Green and Park is a great Addition to the Pleasantness of this Town the Inhabitants being allowed to divert themselves there with Walking Bowling  c  This Seat has been lately purchased by and is now in the Possession of  Claude Fonnereau    Esq  The Country round  Ipswich  is an inexhaustible Storehouse of Timber of which now their Trade of building Ships is abated they send very great Quantities to the King's Buildingyards at  Chatham  which by Water is so little a Way that they often run to it from the Mouth of the River at  Harwich  in one Tide  I cannot omit in this Place the following Account of an excellent Charity for the Relief and Support of the Widows and Orphans of poor Clergymen of the County of  Suffolk  which was begun in the Year by a voluntary Subscription of a small Number of Gentlemen and Clergy in and about  Ipswich  and  Woodbridge  and has since that Time been carried on with such great Success that the  yearly Collection which in was but  l  by gradual Advances every Year amounted in the Year to  l    s    d  and in the Whole Years to the Sum of  l    s    d  Besides the yearly Subscriptions there have been divers Gifts and Legacies given to the said Society to the Uses abovementioned to the Amount of  l    s  So much of which is laid out in  SouthSea  Annuities and kept for raising a capital Stock for the general Benefit of the Charity and the Interest arising from it hath been and still is every Year applied to the Relief and Support of the said Widows and Orphans that they may not mourn without a Comforter and that the Sons and Daughters of the poor Clergy intitled to this Relief may not be suffered to wander as Vagabonds up and down the Earth exposed to those Miseries and Temptations which attend upon extreme Poverty  From  Ipswich  I took a Turn to  Hadley  famous for the Martyrdom of Dr  Rowland Taylor  who was burnt at  Aldham Common Anno  On the Place where he was martyr'd I observed a Stone with this Inscription  Anno    Dr  Taylor  for defending what was good    In this Place shed his Blood  It has been a Town Corporate governed by a Mayor  c  But a  Quo Warranto  being brought against their Charter in the Reign of King  James  II it has not been renewed since Here are two weekly Markets and two annual Fairs It deals much in Corn and abounds with all manner of Provisions The Town is large and tolerably well built but being in a Bottom is generally dirty Its Church is a very handsome Building graced with a Spire Steeple and being near the Middle of the Town is  an Ornament to it 'Tis of some Note still for the Manufacture of Woollen Cloths but not so much as formerly  A little to the Southwest lies  Neyland  a large Markettown in a Bottom upon the  Stour  over which is a very good Bridge The Baystrade is carried on here too  Higher up to the Northwest upon the same River stands  Sudbury  situate on the  Stour  which is now made navigable for Barges from  Maningtree  hither and gives a great Addition to their Trade It is a very antient Town governed by a Mayor and at present consists of three distinct Parishes which have each a handsome and large Church the Names of which are  St Gregory  's  St Peter  's and  AllSaints  tho'  St Peter  's is rather a Chapel of Ease to  St Gregory  's This Town is pretty well built but the Streets being unpaved are dirty It has an handsome Bridge over the  Stour  leading into  Essex  This Town was one of the first Places where King  Edward  III placed the  Flemings  whom he allured hither to teach the  English  the Art of manufacturing their own Wool of which before they knew nothing and here the Woollen Trade hath continued ever since in a flourishing Way The Inhabitants at present employ themselves in making Says Perpetuanas  c  Simon Theobald  surnamed  Sudbury  Archbishop of  Canterbury  translated thither from  London Anno  was a Native of this Town He was murdered at the Instigation of one  John Ball  a seditious and fanatical Preacher in  Wat Tyler  's Rebellion He was a Prelate of very good Character for Learning and Charity He built the Upperend of  St Gregory  's Church in  Sudbury  where his Head is still shewn it was not long since intire covered with the Flesh and Skin dried by Art the Mouth wide open occasioned by Convulsions thro' the hard  Death he died having suffered eight Blows before his Head was cut off He founded in the Place where his Father's House stood a neat College which he furnished with Secular Priests and other Ministers and likewise endowed it bountifully  Near  Sudbury  is  Melford  a pleasant Village and perhaps the largest in  England  being about a Mile in Length The Church is a very fine Edifice and stands at the Northend of it There were two Chantries in it  Weaver  says That on some Part of the Outside of the Church are these Words  Pray for the Souls of  John Clopton  and  Richard Boteler  of whose Goodys this Chapel was built  and that several of the antient Family of  Clopton  are there buried This Town has given two Lord Mayors to  London  Sir  John Milburn  Draper in and Sir  Roger Martin  Mercer in It has an annual Fair divers good Inns many handsome Houses and creditable Inhabitants Here lived the unhappy Mr  Drew  who in the Year was barbarously murdered and his Son Mr  Charles Drew  executed for it who effected it either with his own Hands or by those of another Person whom he procured to do it for the sake of enjoying his Estate The Parricide was attended with Circumstances of great Horror but the Particulars being well known and the Fact so recent I shall not say any more of it here  In my Way from hence to  St Edmond'sbury  I passed due North thro'  Lavenham  or  Lanham  a pretty good Town standing upon a Branch of the River  Breton  It has a spacious Marketplace which was formerly of much better Account than at present It had many Years ago great Advantage from its Trade in Blue Cloths but tho' this is lost yet it has a good Trade for Serges Shalloons Says  c  made here spins a great deal of fine Yarn for  London  and has of late flourished much by setting up  a Hall for selling Wool the Town being conveniently situated for that Purpose  The Church and Steeple here are justly accounted the finest in the County It is situate on a Hill on the Westside of the Town the Steeple being Feet high It has Six tuneable Bells in it and the Inhabitants boast much of their Tenor which they say outdoes all the Bells in  England  for its deep Note and tho' it weighs but Hundred Weight they say it sounds like a Bell of Hundred This Town is also remarkable for the many charitable Bequests made to its Poor and gave  London  a Lord Mayor in in the Person of Sir  Thomas Cooke  Draper the Son of  Robert Cooke  of this Town  East of  Lavenham  and pretty near it is  Bildeston  a Markettown noted for the Cloathingtrade its good Church its mean Buildings and Dirtiness  Bury St Edmunds  is situate on the Westside of the River  Lach  which within these few Years has been made navigable from  Lynn  to  Fornham  a Mile North of the Town It is so regularly built that almost all the Streets cut one another at Right Angles It stands on an easy Ascent and overlooks a most fruitful inclosed Country on the South and Southwest on the North and Northwest the most delightful champain Fields which extend themselves to  Lynn  and that Part of the  Norfolk  Coast and on the East the Country is partly inclosed and partly open No wonder then that it is called the  Montpellier  of  Suffolk  and even of  England  and indeed a certain antient Author says no more than it deserves  "That the Sun shines not upon a Town more agreeable in its Situation"  It is governed by an Alderman which is their chief Magistrate a Recorder capital Burgesses and common Burgesses  It has two plentiful weekly Markets on  Wednesdays  and  Saturdays  and three annual Fairs one three  Days before and three Days after the Feast of St  Matthew  and it is generally protracted to an uncertain Length for the Diversion of the Nobility and Gentry that resort to it in great Numbers  The Abbey once so famous was first built of Wood by  Sigebert  King of the  EastAngles  soon after Christianity was planted here and when finished about the Year that King retired into it and shut himself up from the World  King  Edmund  from whom the Town takes its Name began to reign over the  EastAngles Anno  in the th Year of his Age and reigned Years being killed  Anno  as supposed at  Hoxne  at Years old and his Corps was Years after removed to  Bury  The Abbey being much enriched thereby the Monks who were of the  Benedictine  Order found means about the Year to get it intirely to themselves excluding the Seculars and King  Canute  in the th Year of his Reign founded a more magnificent Church in Honour of St  Edmund  which was finished in Years and dedicated to  Christ  St  Mary  and St  Edmund    Uvius  Prior of  Hulm  who was consecrated the first Abbot  Anno  got the Abbey exempted from Episcopal Jurisdiction and encompassed that and the Town with a Wall and Ditch the Ruins of which in several Places are still to be seen and the Abbots afterwards were made Parliamentary Barons But in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII it run the common Fate of all Religious Houses and that Prince put an End to all its Glory  When the Abbey was in its Prosperity there was a Chapel at every one of the five Gates and the Town abounded with Chapels and Oratories 'Tis possible these might be Hospitals for there was an Hospital of  St Peter  's without  Rishy gate  an Hospital of  St Saviour  's without  Northgate  an  Hospital of  St Nicolas  at or near  Eastgate  and  God'shouse  or  St John  's at the  Southgate  a College of Priests with a Gild to the  Holy  or  Sweet Name of Jesus  the Situation of which I could not find and an House of  Grey Friers  at  Babwell  or the  Tollgate  But at this time there are only two Churches which indeed are very beautiful and stately and stand in the same Churchyard the one dedicated to St  Mary  the other built in the Reign of  Edward  VI to St  James  The latter has a convenient Library and at the West End of the South Isle are interred  James Reynolds    Esq  late Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and his Lady to whose Memories two large Monuments are erected The Church of  St Mary  has on the Northside of the Altar to which we approach by a fine Ascent of Six Steps the Tomb of  Mary  Queen of  France  Sister to  Henry  VIII and Wife to  Charles Brandon  Duke of  Suffolk  Her Coffin is of Lead and has this Inscription on it  Mary Queen    of France Edmund H  There are other handsome Monuments in this Church  The other most remarkable publick Buildings are the Abbeygate which is still a fine Monument of what the Abbey once was the Guild hall the Woolhall the Shirehouse the Marketcross and the GrammarSchool endowed by King  Edward  VI  Such as is the Town for Situation is the Neighbourhood and Gentry about it for Politeness and no Place glories in brighter Ladies or better Families  In the Pathway between the two Churches it was that  Arundel Coke    Esq  a Barrister at Law in the Year attempted with the Assistance of one  Woodbourne  a barbarous Assassin an unheardof Outrage on his Brotherinlaw  Edward Cris    Esq  for the sake of possessing what he had He had invited  him his Wife and Family to Supper with him and in the Night on Pretence of going to see a Friend to them both he led him into the Churchyard when on a Signal he gave the Assassin made at Mr  Crisp  with a Hedgebill and in a most terrible manner mangled his Head and Face and supposing him dead there left him and  Coke  returned as if he knew nothing of the Matter to the Company But it happening that Mr  Crisp  was not killed and coming back to  Coke  's House to the Company all bloody and cruelly mangled the shocking Sight amazed and confounded them all  Coke  that he was not dead the rest that he had met with so strange a Disaster Mr  Crisp  has survived this Outrage many Years and  Coke  and  Woodburne  the hired Assassin were justly executed for a Villainy so detestable that it hardly had its Parallel The Gentleman being not killed the Assassins were tried and condemned on the Statute for defacing and dismembring called  The Coventry Act  And  Coke  was so  good  a Lawyer and so  hardened  a Wretch that he thought to have saved himself by pleading that he intended not to  deface  but to  kill  Some nice People say the Law was a little strained in their Punishment as the Gentleman recovered but surely if in any Case the  Letter  might be dispensed with and the  Spirit  be brought in Aid of it it was right in this and it would have been next to a national Disgrace not to have a Law that would reach so flagrant and complicated a Wickedness  There is very little or no Manufacturing in this Town except Spinning the chief Business of the Place depending upon the neighbouring Gentry who cannot fail to cause Trade enough by the Expence of their Families and Equipages among the People of a Country Town Our Monarchs  Edward  I and II had a Mint at  Bury  and some of their Pennies coined there are yet remaining  Stow  in his Survey of  London p  says That here was also a Mint in King  John  's Time  This Town is famous for two great Events One That a Parliament was held here in the Year in the th Year of  Henry  VI The other That at the Meeting of this Parliament the good  Humphry  Duke of  Gloucester  Regent of the Kingdom during the Absence of King  Henry  V and in the Minority of his Son  Henry  VI and to his last Hour the Safeguard of the whole Nation and Darling of the People was basely murdered here by whose Death the Gate was opened to that dreadful War between the Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  which ended in the Confusion of the very Race who are supposed to have contrived that Murder  As I made some Stay at  Ipswich  and  Bury  being obliged to wait the Leisure of a Gentleman who accompanied me Part of this Journey I made several Excursions more Inland than I had at first intended when I set out and visited the following Towns  As first  Boxford  which is about Seven Miles from  Sudbury  and is a neat and wellbuilt Village and carries on a considerable Traffick  At  Bures  on the  Stour  King  Edward  was crown'd and not at  Bury  It has a good Bridge on that River  Anno  the Spire of the Steeple of the handsome Church here was burnt by Lightning the Bellframes destroyed and the Bells melted  Clare  is situate on the  Stour  about Miles from  Bury  and is but a poor Town and dirty the Streets being unpaved But yet the Civil and Spiritual Courts are held at it and it has a good Church and shews still the Ruins of a strong Castle and an old Monastery It gives Title of Earl to his Grace the Duke of  Newcastle  of the  Pelham  Family as it did to that of  Holles  before  Not far from  Clare  is  Honedon  where in the Year the Sexton digging a Grave found a large Quantity of  Saxon  Coins  Cavendish  upon the  Stour  deserves Mention for giving Name to the Noble Family of the Dukes of  Devonshire    Haverhill  stands partly in  Essex  and partly in  Suffolk  By the Ruins of a Church and Castle still to be seen here it appears to have been of greater Consequence formerly than at present Now I am at this Place I shall just mention  Ledgate  on account of its giving Birth and Name to the famous Poet Orator Mathematician and Philosopher  John Ledgate  who died in Here are to be seen the Ruins of a strong Castle  Stoke juxta Neyland  gave a Lord Mayor to  London  in  viz  Sir  William Capel  of the Drapers Company from whom is descended the present Earl of  Essex  It has a fair Church and Steeple  Giffard  's  hall  in this Parish is a noble old Seat belonging to Sir  Francis Mannock  Bart And  Penderinghall  is the newbuilt fair Seat of Sir  John Williams  Alderman of  London    Stratford  is a thoroughfare Village of great Traffick and is employed in the Woollen Manufactures  Easterbergholt  near four Miles from  Stratford  and half a Mile North of the  Stour  is a large and handsome Village employ'd in the Woollen Way but not to so great a Degree as formerly It has a good Church but the Steeple is in Ruins and the Bells are rung by Hand in a kind of Cage set up in the Churchyard A little South of the Church is an elegant House of Sir  Joseph Hankey  Alderman of  London    Hemingston  may bear the Mention for the merry Tenure by which that Manor was held according to  Camden  by Serjeanty the Possessor being obliged every  Christmasday  to perform before the King one  Saltus  one  Sufflatus  and one  Bombulus  or as is  read elsewhere it was held by a  Saltus  a  Sufflatus  and a  Pet  that is as  Camden  interprets the Words he was to dance make a Noise with his Cheeks puffed out and let a Ft  Needham  is a thoroughfare Town about nine Miles Northwest from  Ipswich  It is tolerably well built has several considerable Dealers in it and formerly carried on a large Trade in the Woollen Manufactures which it has lost for some Years  Bildeston  is a meanly built dirty Town but has a good Church  Stowmarket  about three Miles from  Needham  is a tolerable Town with a spacious Church and SpireSteeple  And five Miles further being eight from  Bury  is  Wulpit  famous for the white Bricks made there It has a handsome Church and SpireSteeple  At  Norton  near  Wulpit  King  Henry  VIII was induced to dig for Gold He was disappointed but the Diggings are visible at this Day  Ixworth  about seven Miles from  Bury  is a dirty illbuilt Town with a mean Market but is a thoroughfare Town and has two annual Fairs  Botesdale  is a long meanbuilt dirty thoroughfare Town yet it is remarkable for a Grammar Freeschool founded by Sir  Nicolas Bacon  and established by Queen  Elizabeth  The Master and Usher are to be elected out of  Bennet  College  Cambridge  where Sir  Nicolas  was educated The Master enjoys a Salary of Pounds  per Annum  besides the Benefit of the Schoolhouse and the Usher eight Pounds with a House and Yard The Schoolhouse is now in the Gift of  Edmund Britiffe    Esq  Sir  Nicolas  also bequeathed  l  a Year to the said College for six Scholars out of this School to whom likewise Archbishop  Tenison  was said to have given six Pounds annually There is a mean Market here every  Thursday  and an annual Fair on  Holy Thursday    Mildenhall  about Miles from  Bury  is situate on the River  Larke  it is a Town of very extensive Limits pleasant and wellbuilt and has a noble Church and lofty Steeple It has a plentiful  Friday  Market and a very considerable annual Fair which lasts four Days A little North of the Church is the Mansionhouse of Sir  Thomas Hanmer  Bart who in the Reign of Queen  Anne  was Speaker of the House of Commons In the Year a great Part of this Town was consumed by Fire It furnished the City of  London  with two Lord Mayors Sir  Henry Barton  Skinner  Anno  and Sir  William Gregory  of the same Company  Anno    Ickworth  was once a Parish but now is a noble Park in which is the Seat of the Earl of  Bristol  It is a Place of great Antiquity and what confirms it is what that learned Antiquarian Dr  Battley  Archdeacon of  Canterbury  writes That in his Memory a large Pot of  Roman  Money was found here  Debenham  is a tolerably clean tho' meanbuilt Town and among very dirty and heavy Roads being seated on a Hill The Church is a good Building the Marketplace tolerable and there is a Freeschool founded by Appointment of Sir  Robert Hitcham    Crowshall  about a Mile Southeast of this Town was formerly the Seat of the  Gawdies  till Sir  Charles Gawdy  Bart convey'd it to  John Pit    Esq  in a Descendant of whose Family it still remains  Mendlesham  is a dirty and poor Town but has a handsome Church and a small  Tuesday's  Market  Eye  is a Town Corporate governed by two Bailiffs ten principal Burgesses and Commoncouncilmen and gives Title of Baron to the Lord  Cornwallis  It is situate in a Bottom between two Rivers is meanly built and the Streets dirty Near the Westend of the Church are still to be seen some of the ruinous Walls of the Castle  My Friend having finished his Business in those Parts of  Suffolk  which lie round the Towns of  Bury  and  Ipswich  gave me an Opportunity of resuming my Journey according to the Plan I laid down at the Beginning of the Letter and so from the former of these Towns I returned by  Stowmarket  and  Needham  to  Ipswich  that I might keep as near the Coast as was proper to my designed Circuit having determined to take the Opportunity which he told me his Affairs would give me of making two or three Excursions from  Woodbridge Aldborough  and  Southwould  to make my Observations on that Part of  Suffolk  which I have not yet touched upon From  Ipswich  therefore I went to visit the Sea again and so to  Woodbridge  and from thence to  Orford  on the Sea Coast  Woodbridge  is a Markettown situate on the River  Deben  about Miles from the Sea This River being navigable to the Town for Ships of considerable Burden it drives a pretty good Trade with  Holland Newcastle  and  London  and has Passage Hoys that go to and return from  London  weekly It has a fine Church and Steeple and traded formerly in Sackcloth and now in refining Salt The Shirehall is a handsome Pile of Building where the QuarterSessions for this Part of the County are held and under it is the Corncross One Street in it called  Stonestreet  is wellbuilt and paved but the rest are dirty The Marketplace and Thoroughfare are also well enough built but the rest of the Town is mean The Quays and Warehouses are very commodious and here is a Grammarschool and an Almshouse erected in by  Thomas Seckford  Master of the Requests for Thirteen Men and Three Women which is well endowed It has a pretty good Market on  Wednesdays  and two annual Fairs  Walton  has been an antient Markettown and tho' the Market is now disused the Cross is still remaining  In the neighbouring Parish of  Felixstow  on the Cliff by the Sea and about a Mile from the  Colne  Side of  Woodbridgehaven  are discerned the Ruins of a quadrangular Castle advantageously situated of which nothing now remains but the Foundation of one Side of the Wall The rest has been devoured by the Sea and in all Probability these Remains must in a few Years undergo the same Fate It was built principally of Rockstones but the many  Roman  Bricks still to be seen and  Roman  Coins which have been discovered among the Ruins of the Side Walls as they have been washed away by the Sea in the present Age are an undeniable Evidence that it was a Place of considerable Antiquity probably a  Roman  Colony which might give Name to the Hundred of  Colnies  in which it stood  Now begins that Part which is ordinarily called  HighSuffolk  which being a rich Soil is for a long Way wholly employed in Dairies and famous for the best Butter and perhaps the worst Cheese in  England  the Butter is barrelled and sometimes pickled up in small Casks in which it keeps so well that I have know a Firkin of  Suffolk  Butter sent to the  WestIndies  and brought back to  England  again perfectly good and sweet as at first  From hence turning down to the Shore we see  Orfordness  a noted Point of Land for the Guide of the Colliers and Coasters and a good Shelter for them to ride under when a strong Northeast Wind blows and makes a foul Shore on the Coast  Orford  is situate on the Northwest Side of the River  Ore  whence it had its Name It was formerly a Town of good Account having a strong Castle of reddish Stone for its Defence of which and of a  Benedictine  Nunnery near the Quay there are still to be seen considerable Ruins The Sea has so much withdrawn itself from this Town that it is robbed of its chief Advantage and deserves not the Name  of a Harbour The Town is mean and no one contends for an Interest in it but such as want to make themselves a Merit in the Choice of the two Members which it returns to Parliament It is a Town Corporate and is governed by a Mayor eight Portmen and twelve Burgesses it has also a mean  Monday  Market and an annual Fair It had the Honour to give Title of Earl to the brave Admiral  Russel  but that is now extinct  About three Miles from  Orford  is  Aldburgh  a Town pleasantly situated in a Valley It has two Streets each near a Mile long but its Breadth which was more considerable formerly is not proportionable and the Sea has of late Years swallowed up one whole Street The Town tho' meanly built is clean and well peopled in the Seafaring way The Sea washes the Eastside of it and the River  Ald  runs not far from the Southend of it affording a good Quay In the adjacent Seas Sprats Soles and Lobsters are caught in abundance The Town trades to  Newcastle  for Coals and from hence Corn is transported The Manor of  Aldburgh  as also the Manors of  Scots  and  Taskards  in the Neighbourhood formerly belonged to the Monastery of  Snape  and were first granted with that Monastery to Cardinal  Wolsey  and soon after to  Thomas  Duke of  Norfolk Aldburgh  is pretty well situated for Strength and has several Pieces of Cannon for its Defence The Church which is a good Edifice stands on a Hill a little West of the Town It is a Town Corporate governed by Two Bailiffs Ten capital Burgesses and Twentyfour inferior Officers  From  Aldburgh  I passed thro'  Saxminden  a little dirty Markettown to  Dunwich  a very antient Town which by  Roman  Coins dug up there is supposed to have been a  Roman  Station In the Reign of  the Conqueror  it was so considerable a Place  that it had Burgesses and was valued to that King at  l  and Herrings We read that in the Reign of  Henry  II it was a very famous Village well stored with Riches and fortified with a Rampart some Remains of which still appear  Before these Times in the Reign of King  Sigebert Anno    Dunwich  was a Bishop's See and so continued till the  Conqueror  made his Chaplain Bishop of it and translated the See to  Thetford  which was afterwards translated from thence to  Norwich    There were several Religious Houses in  Dunwich  and some pretend no less than fifty Churches but there is a certain Account of six Parishchurches and three Chapels besides the several Religious Houses Four of these Parishchurches and the three Chapels have been long devoured by the Sea and one of the others met with the same Fate in this Age so that there is only one now standing and what remains of this once famous Place is but a pitiful Parcel of sorry Cottages  Hereabouts they begin to talk of Herrings and the Fishery And here also and at  Swole  or  Southwould  the next Seaport they cure Sprats in the same manner as they do Herrings at  Yarmouth    From  Dunwich  we went to  Southwould  pleasantly situated on a Hill and almost surrounded with the Sea and the River  Biyth  over which it has a Bridge It drives a considerable Trade in Salt and old Beer and in Herrings Sprats  c  The Church is large and very strong The Bay called corruptly  Sowl  or  Solebay  is a commodious Place for Anchorage and occasions a great Resort of Mariners to it which adds greatly to its Trade and Commerce  The Traffick of my Friend at  Woodbridge Aldburgh  and this Place gave me the Opportunity I hinted at of making Excursions into the maininland Parts of  Suffolk  adjacent to those Towns  which I shall transcribe from my Memorandumbook in the Order I set them down  Ufford  is at present of no great Remark but has the Ruins of a Chapel called  Sogenhoc  Chapel  Richard Lufkin  was Rector of this Parish Years and was buried  September  in the th Year of his Age He performed all the Offices of his Function to the last and preached the  Sunday  before his Death He was plundered in the grand Rebellion and lost all that he had except a Silver Spoon which he preserved by hiding it in his Sleeve  In the Hundred of  Hartsmere  stands  Broome  a noble old Mansion which for many Ages has been the Seat of the noble Family of  Cornwallis  In this Parish of  Broome  is an Almshouse for poor Widows fronting the Hall but not endowed  Wickham  Market is situated about four Miles from  Woodbridge  The Church is built on a Hill and tho' but Yards high affords the best Prospect of any in  Suffolk  for in a clear Day near Parishchurches may be seen from it It is now only a Village but has some Trade and the Civil and Spiritual Courts are held in it  Snape  was once noted for a famous Monastery few Remains of which are to be seen It has a considerable annual Fair for Horses which lasts four Days beginning  August  to which the  London  Jockeys resort  At  Sudbourne  is a fine Seat of the Lord Viscount  Hereford    At  Easton  is the Seat of the Earl of  Rochford  formerly belonging to the  Wingfield  Family  Letheringham  was of Note for a little Priory which was obtained at the Dissolution by Sir  Antony Wingfield  and Sir  Henry Spelman  tells us that as a Judgment for the Sacrilege he died without Issue Male It was converted into a Mansionhouse and is now the Seat of the antient Family of the  Nauntons  Sir  Roger Naunton  was in the Reign of King  James  I Secretary of State and Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries He died  Anno  In the Abbey is a long Gallery adorned with several valuable Pictures And in  Letheringham  Church are some elegant and magnificent Monuments of the  Wingfields  and  Nauntons    Rendelsham  was antiently famous for being the Royal Residence of  Redwald  King of the  EastAngles Hugh FitzOtho  procured a Market and Fair for this Town from King  Edward  I Digging here about Years ago an antient Silver Crown was found weighing about Ounces supposed to have belonged to  Redwald  or some other King of the  EastAngles  which was sold and melted down for the sake of the Metal  At  Butley  was a Priory of Canons Regular founded by  Ranulph de Glanville  chief Justice of  England  to the Honour of the Blessed Virgin The Ruins of the Abbey which are still to be seen shew it to have been very large and the Gatehouse is a magnificent Building it remains intire and is embellished in the Front with many Coats of Arms finely cut in Stone  Framlingham  is situate North of  Aldburgh  a large Town wellbuilt and pleasantly seated near the Head of the River  Ore  it has a spacious Marketplace the Church is built of black Flint and is a very stately and noble Edifice wherein several of the  Mowbrays  Dukes of  Norfolk  lie buried The Castle is a fair Piece of Antiquity being a large beautiful and strong Building and contains within the Walls now standing an Acre Rood Perches and was formerly much larger Its Walls are Feet high and thick and are standing pretty intire and it has Towers Feet higher than the Walls two of which are Watchtowers It was both by Art and Nature formerly very strong  There are two good Almshouses and a Freeschool founded by Sir  Robert Hitcham  who is interred in the Church for poor Boys who are taught to read write and cast Accounts and  l  is given to settle each of them Apprentice This Gentleman bought of the Duke of  Norfolk  the Castle Manor  c  and gave them to  Pembrokehall  in  Cambridge  To this Castle Queen  Mary  I retired when the Lady  Jane  was proclaimed Queen by the  Northumberland  Faction  Blithburg  was formerly a Place of good Note but now has nothing to recommend it but its Church which is a fine old Building and kept in good Repair  At  Chediston  is the fine Seat of  Walter Plumer    Esq  who bought it lately and rebuilt the Hall in a beautiful manner  Halesworth  is Northeast of  Framlingham  a large and good Markettown situated upon the River  Blyth  which runs thro' it The Streets are clean and partly paved It has a very neat Church beautifully decorated within and is noted for Linenyarn which is spun in the Neighbourhood and sold here  Hoxne  is the Place where  Edmund  King of the  EastAngles  was murdered by the Pagan  Danes  because he would not renounce his Faith  Anno  and his Body was removed to  Bury  as abovementioned  Bungay  is a wellfrequented Markettown pleasantly situate upon and almost surrounded with the  Waveney  which is navigable thither for Barges It lies Northeast of  Halesworth  Its Streets are mostly unpaved but the Town is handsome and wellbuilt since the great Fire which broke out about Sunrising on  March  in a small uninhabited House and in four Hours time consumed the whole Town except one small Street The whole Loss was computed at  l  and upwards It has two Parishchurches one of which is a very noble  one and has a beautiful Steeple The Ruins of a  Benedictine  Nunnery and a very strong Castle are still to be seen here The latter was so strong that  Hugh Bigod  its Owner in the Wars between the Empress  Maud  and King  Stephen  with the latter of whom he sided made this Boast upon it  Were I in my Castle of  Bungay  Upon the River  Waveney  I would not care for the King of  Cockney  But yet he was forced afterwards to compound with King  Henry  II for its Preservation It has a Grammarschool with Scholarships for  Emanuel  College  Cambridge    In this Excursion I stretched to  Beccles  still further Northeast a large illbuilt Markettown situate on the  Waveney  which is navigable hence from  Yarmouth  to  Bungay  as I have said It has a noble Church and Steeple and a Grammar and  English  School well endowed It has a plentiful Market and a Common of above Acres The Streets are well paved and clean but the Houses are but ordinary The Ruins of another Church called  Ingate  Church are to be seen here which was formerly the Parish Church to the Town  Burghcastle  scituate at the Mouth of the  Waveney  was a Place of considerable Note in the Time of the  Romans  The Walls on the East North and South Sides are still standing pretty intire and the River being a Defence on the West no Wall was wanting there  I returned from these Excursions to  Southwould  in order to proceed on my Journey according to my first Plan But it may not be amiss to mention before I proceed That this Town is made famous by an Engagement at Sea in the Year between the  English  and  Dutch  Fleets in the Bay opposite to  the Town in which the brave  Montague  Earl of  Sandwich  Admiral under the Duke of  York  lost his Life his Ship  Royal Prince  carrying Guns which was under him commanded by Sir  Edward Spragg  was burnt and several other Ships lost and about Seamen  At this Town in particular and so at all the Towns on this Coast from  Orfordness  to  Yarmouth  is the ordinary Place where our Summer Friends the Swallows first land when they come to visit us and here they may be said to begin their Voyage when they go back into warmer Climates I was some Years before at this Place about the Beginning of  October  and lodging in a House that looked into the Churchyard I observed in the Evening an unusual Multitude of Swallows sitting on the Leads of the Church and covering the Tops of several Houses round about This led me to inquire what was the Meaning of such a prodigious Multitude of Swallows sitting there I was answered That this was the Season when the Swallows their Food failing here began to leave us and return to the Country whereever it be from whence they came and that this being the nearest Land to the opposite Coast and the Wind contrary they were waiting for a Gale and might be said to be  Windbound    This was more evident to me when in the Morning I found the Wind had come about to the Northwest in the Night and there was not one Swallow to be seen  Certain it is that the Swallows neither come hither merely for warm Weather nor retire merely from Cold they like the Shoals of Fish in the Sea pursue their Prey being a voracious Creature and feeding as they fly for their Food is the Insects of which in our Summer Evenings in damp and moist Places the Air is full and when cold Weather comes in and kills the Insects then Necessity  compels the Swallows to quit us and follow their Food to some other Climate  This passing and repassing of the Swallows is observed nowhere so much as on this Eastern Coast namely from above  Harwich  to the East Point of  Norfolk  called  Wintertonness  North which is opposite to  Holland  We know nothing of them any farther North the Passage of the Sea being as I suppose too broad from  Flambro'  Head and the Shore of  Holderness  in  Yorkshire  c  This Part of  England  is remarkable for being the first where the Feeding and Fattening of Sheep and other Cattle with Turneps was first practised in  England  which is made a very great Part of the Improvement of their Lands to this Day and from whence the Practice is spread over most of the East and South Part of  England  to the great enriching of the Farmers and Increase of fat Cattle and tho' some have objected against the Goodness of the Flesh thus fed with Turneps and have fansied it would taste of the Root yet upon Experience 'tis found that there is no Reason for this Fancy  The County of  Suffolk  is particularly famous for furnishing the City of  London  and all the Counties round with Turkeys insomuch that more Turkeys are bred in this County and the Part of  Norfolk  that joins to it for Sale than in all the rest of  England    Nor will this be found an inconsiderable Article if it be true that Droves of Turkeys have passed in one Season over  Stratfordbridge  on the River  Stour  on the Road from  Ipswich  to  London  each Drove generally containing from to Turkeys which at one with another will be in all and yet the Numbers which are driven by  New Marketheath  and the open Country and the Forest and also those by  Sudbury  and  Clare  are much greater  For the further Supplies of the Markets of  London  with Poultry in which these Countries particularly abound they have within these few Years found it practicable to make the Geese travel on foot too and prodigious Numbers are brought up to  London  in like Droves from the farthest Parts of  Norfolk  even from the FenCountry about  Lynn Downham Wisbich  and the  Washes  as also from all the Eastside of  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  and 'tis very frequent now to meet or in a Drove They begin to drive them generally in  August  when the Harvest is almost over that the Geese may feed on the Stubble as they go Thus they hold on to the End of  October  when the Roads begin to be too stiff and deep for their broad Feet and short Legs to march in  Besides such Methods of driving these Creatures on Foot they have of late invented a new kind of Carriage being Carts formed on purpose with four Stories or Stages to put the Poultry in one above another whereby one Cart will carry a very great Number and for the smoother going they drive with two Horses abreast like a Coach thus quartering the Road for the Ease of the Poultry and changing Horses they travel Night and Day so that they bring the Fowls or Miles in two Days and one Night The Horses are fasten'd together by a Piece of Wood lying crosswise upon their Necks by which they are kept even and together and the Driver sits on the Top of the Cart as in the publick Carriages for the Army  c  In this manner vast Numbers of Turkeypoults and Chickens are carried to  London  every Year which yield a good Price at Market and more out of this County than any other Part of  England  which is the Reason of my speaking of it here  In this Part which we call  High Suffolk  there are not so many Families of Gentry or Nobility as in the other Side of the Country But 'tis observed  that tho' their Seats are not here their Estates are and the Pleasure of  West Suffolk  is much of it supported by the Wealth of  High Suffolk  For the Richness of the Lands and Application of the People to all Kinds of Improvement are scarce credible The Farmers also are so very considerable and their Farms and Dairies so large that 'tis very frequent for a Farmer to have  l  Stock upon his Farm in Cows only  From  Southwould  Coastwise I proceeded to  Leostoff  a considerable Markettown standing near the Sea It is indifferently well built The Church which is situate near a Mile on the Westside of the Town is a good Building but for the Ease of its Inhabitants there is a Chapel in the Town wherein divine Service is sometimes celebrated The  Ness  below the Northend of the Town is since the washing away of  Eastonness  the most Eastern Point of Land in  Great Britain  Its principal Trade is Fishing for Herrings and Maycril It has a noted Market weekly on  Wednesdays  and two small Fairs yearly the one on the st Day of  May  and the other on the th of  September  Besides the present Chapel here was formerly at the Southend of the Town a Chapel called  Goodcrosschapel  which hath long since been destroyed by the Sea This Town having been Part of the antient Demesnes of the Crown hath a Charter and a Townseal But the greatest Privilege they now enjoy from their Charter is that of not serving on Juries either at the Sessions or Assizes  From  High Suffolk  I passed the  Waveney  near  ScholeInn  and so came into  NORFOLK    But I believe Sir you will allow that I have written enough in all Conscience for one Letter I will therefore only further add that I am  Your humble Servant  LETTER II CONTAINING A Description of the Counties of  NORFOLK  and  CAMBRIDGE  and that Part of  ESSEX  not touched on in the former  SIR  _IN my Journey from  High Suffolk  to  Norfolk  I saw at  Redgrave  the Seat of the Family a beautiful Monument of that excellent Judge Sir  John Holt  with the following Inscription upon it  M S  D  Johannis Holt  Equitis Aur  Totius  Angliae  in Banco Regis  per    Annos continuos  Capitalis Justitiarii  Gulielmo  Regi Annae{que} Reginae  Consiliarii perpetui  Libertatis ac Legum  Anglicarum  Assertoris Vindicis Custodis  Vigilis Acris Intrepidi  Rolandus  Frater Unicus Haeres  Optime de se Merito  Posuit  Die Martii Vto    sublatus est  ex Oculis nostris  Natus    Decembris Anno    In  English  thus  Sacred to the Memory of Sir  John Holt  Knight Lord Chief Justice of the  King'sbench  for the Space of Years successively and of the Privy Council to King  William  and Queen  Anne  A vigilant penetrating and intrepid Assertor Vindicator and Guardian of the Liberty and Laws of  England    Rowland  his only Brother and Heir erected this Monument to him who deserved all things at his Hands He departed this Life the fifth Day of  March Anno  And was born the th of  December Anno    When we come into  Norfolk  we see a Face of Diligence spread over the whole Country the vast Manufactures carried on chiefly by the  Norwich  Weavers employ all the Country round in spinning Yarn for them and also use many thousand Packs of Yarn which they receive from other Countries even from as far as  Yorkshire  and  Westmorland  of which I shall speak in its Place  This Side of  Norfolk  is very populous and filled with a great Number of considerable Markettowns insomuch that between the Borders of  Suffolk  and the City of  Norwich  on this Side which is not above Miles in Breadth are the following Markettowns  viz  Thetford  Dis  Harling  Bucknam  Hingham  West Deerham  Attleboro'  Windham  Harleston  East  Deerham    Watton  Loddon  c  Most of these Towns are very populous and large but that which is most remarkable is that the whole Country round them is interspersed with Villages so large and so full of People that they are equal to Markettowns in other Counties  An eminent Weaver of  Norwich  gave me a Scheme of their Trade on this Occasion by which calculating from the Number of Looms at that time employ'd in the City of  Norwich  only he made it appear very plain that there were People busy'd in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures of that City only not that the People all lived in the City tho'  Norwich  is very large and populous but they were employ'd for spinning the Yarn used for such Goods as were all made in that City  This shews the wonderful Extent of the  Norwich  Manufacture or Stuffweaving Trade by which so many thousand Families are maintained  This Throng of Villages continues thro' all the East Part of the Country which is of the greatest  Extent and where the Manufacture is chiefly carried on If any Part of it be thin of Inhabitants it is the West Part drawing a Line from about  Brandon  South to  Walsingham  North This Part of the Country indeed is full of open Plains and somewhat sandy and barren but yet feeds great Flocks of good Sheep  NORWICH  is the Capital of the County and the Centre of all the Trade and Manufactures which I have just mentioned an antient large rich and populous City If a Stranger was only to ride thro' or view the City of  Norwich  on ordinary Days he would be induced to think it a Town without Inhabitants but on the contrary if he was to view the City either on a  Sabbathday  or on any publick Occasion he would wonder where all the People could dwell the Multitude is so great But the Case is this the Inhabitants being all busy at their Manufactures dwell in their Garrets at their Looms and in their Combingshops as they call them Twistingmills and other Workhouses almost all the Works they are employ'd in being done within Doors There are in this City Parishes besides the Cathedral and a great many Meetinghouses of Dissenters of all Denominations The Castle is antient and decayed and now for many Years past made use of for a Gaol  This City as 'tis said was built by the  Saxons  out of the Ruins of  Venta Icenorum  now called  Caster  where some Years since were found several  Roman  Urns In the Time of the  Saxons  it was the principal Seat of the  East Angles  and was reduced to Ashes by  Sueno  the  Dane  It was reedified and Famine only compelled it to yield to  William the Conqueror    The famous Rebellion of  Kett  the Tanner of  Windham  in the Reign of  Edward  VI reduced it again to a ruinous State but it was happily restored  by Queen  Elizabeth  who sent hither Part of the  Flemings  that came over from the cruel Persecution of the Duke of  Alva  to whose Industry and Example is owing the rich Manufacture of Stuffs for which this City is so famous  The Walls of this City are reckoned three Miles in Circumference taking in more Ground than the City of  London  within the Walls but much of that Ground lies open in Pasturefields and Gardens nor does it seem to be like some antient Places a decayed declining Town the Walls only marking out its antient Dimensions for we do not see room to suppose that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now But the Walls seem to be placed as if it was expected that the City would in time increase sufficiently to fill them up with Buildings There are large Gates which give Entrance to the City  The Cathedral is a fine Fabrick and the SpireSteeple beautiful and next  Salisbury  the highest in  England  It is not antient the Bishop's See having been first at  Thetford  from whence it was not translated hither till the th Century yet the Church has so many Antiquities in it that our late great Scholar and Physician Sir  Thomas Brown  thought it worth his while to write a whole Book to collect the Monuments and Inscriptions in this Church to which I refer the Reader It has an Hospital in it for poor Men and Women and a fine Marketcross That called  Bridewell  is a large and most beautiful Building of square Flint  The River  Yare  runs through it and is navigable thus far without the Help of Locks or Stops and being increased by other Waters passes afterwards through a long Track of the richest Meadows and the largest take them all together that are anywhere in  England  lying for Miles in Length from this City to  Yarmouth  including the Return  of the said Meadows on the Bank of the  Waveney  South and on the River  Thyrn  North  There are Six large Bridges over the River running thro' the City called  Hellesden Coslany Blackfryers Tyebridge Whitefriers  and  Bishopsgate  Bridges and to repair these Bridges as also the Walls and Gates and the City Wastes Stathes and Wharfs which were become so ruinous that the ordinary Revenue of the City was insufficient for that Purpose an Act of Parliament passed in the Year which laid divers Tolls and Imposts on particular Goods and Merchandizes brought into the City the Produce of which were also to repair the great Roads leading from  Norwich  towards  London  by which means these Roads Bridges Walls  c  were put into good Condition and kept so  One thing is proper to be mentioned here which History accounts not for It is this The River  Waveney  is a considerable River and of a deep and full Chanel navigable for large Barges as high as  Beccles  and  Bungay  it runs for a Course of about Miles between the two Counties of  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  as a Boundary to both and pushing forward tho' with a gentle Stream no one would doubt when they see the River growing broader and deeper and going directly towards the Sea even to the Edge of the Beach and within a Mile of the main Ocean but that it would make its Entrance into the Sea at that Place and afford a noble Harbour for Ships at the Mouth of it when on a sudden the Land rising high by the Seaside crosses the Head of the River like a Dam checks the whole Course of it and it returns bending its Course West for two Miles or thereabouts and then turning North thro' another long Course of Meadows joining to those just now mentioned seeks out the River  Yare  joins its Water with hers and both find their Way to the Sea together  Some of our Historians tell a long fabulous Story of this River's being once open and a famous Harbour for Ships belonging to the Town of  Leostof  adjoining but that  Yarmouth  envying the Prosperity of  Leostof  made War upon them and that after many bloody Battles as well by Sea as by Land they came at last to a decisive Action at Sea with their respective Fleets but the  Leostof  Fleet being overthrown and utterly destroyed the  Yarmouth  Men either actually stopped up the Mouth of the said River or obliged the vanquished  Leostof  Men to do it themselves and bound them never to attempt to open it again  I see no Authority for this Relation neither do the Relators agree either in the Time or in the Particulars of the Fact  In this vast Tract of Meadows are fed a prodigious Number of Black Cattle which are said to produce the fattest Beef tho' not the largest in  England  and the Quantity is so great as that they not only supply the City of  Norwich  the Town of  Yarmouth  and the County adjacent but send great Quantities of them weekly in all the Winter Season to  London    And this in particular is worthy Remark That the gross of all the  Scots  Cattle which come yearly into  England  are brought to a small Village lying North of the City of  Norwich  called St  Faith  's where the  Norfolk  Grasiers go and buy them  These  Scots  Runts as they call them coming out of the cold and barren Mountains of the Highlands in  Scotland  feed so eagerly on the rich Pasture in these Marshes that they thrive in an unusual manner and grow very fat and the Beef is so delicious for Taste that the Inhabitants prefer them to the  English  Cattle which are much larger and fairer to look at Some have told me and I believe with Truth that there are above of these  Scots  Cattle fed in this County every Year and most of  them in the Marshes between  Norwich Beccles  and  Yarmouth    Yarmouth  is an antient Town much older than  Norwich  and tho' not extending over so much Ground yet better built and more complete and not much inferior in Number of Inhabitants and for Wealth Traffick and Advantage of its Situation infinitely superior to  Norwich    It is situated on a Peninsula between the River  Yare  and the Sea the two last lying parallel to one another and the Town in the Middle The River lies on the Westside of the Town and being grown very large and deep by the Receiving of all the Rivers on this side the County forms the Haven and the Town facing to the West also and open to the River makes the finest Quay in  England  if not in  Europe  at least equalling that of  Marseilles  itself  The Ships ride here so close as it were keeping up one another with their Headfasts on Shore that for half a Mile together they go cross the Stream with their Boltsprits over the Land their Bows or Heads touching the very Wharf so that one may walk from Ship to Ship as on a floating Bridge all along by the Shoreside The Quay reaching from the Drawbridge almost to the Southgate is so spacious and wide that in some Places 'tis near Yards from the Houses to the Wharf In this pleasant and agreeable Range of Houses are some very magnificent Buildings and among the rest the Customhouse and Townhall and some Merchants Houses which look like little Palaces rather than the Dwellinghouses of private Men  The greatest Defect of this beautiful Town seems to be that tho' it is very rich and increasing in Wealth and Trade and consequently in People there is not Room to inlarge it by new Buildings being precluded on the West and Southsides by the River and on the Eastside by the Sea so that there  is no Room but on the Northend without the Gate and there the Land is not very agreeable but had they had a larger Space within the Gates there would before now have been many spacious Streets of Buildings erected as we see is done in some other thriving Towns in  England    During the Fishingfair as they call it one sees the Land covered with People and the River with Barks and Boats busy Day and Night landing and carrying off the Herrings which they catch here in almost incredible Quantities I happened to be there during their Fishingfair when I told in one Tide One hundred and ten Barks and fishing Vessels coming up the River all loaden with Herrings taken the Night before and this over and above what was brought on Shore on the Dean that is the Seaside of the Town by open Boats which they call  The  Cobles  are open Boats which come from the North from  Scarbro' Whitby  c and come to  Yarmouth  to let themselves out to fish for the Merchants during the Fairtime  Cobles  and which often bring in two or three  A Last is ten Barrels each Barrel containing a thousand Herrings  Lasts of Fish at a Time The  The Barks come from the Coast of  Kent  and  Sussex  as from  Folkston Dover  and  Rye  in  Kent  and from  Brighthelmston  in  Sussex  and let themselves out to fish for the Merchants during the said Fair as the  Cobles  do from the North  Barks often bring ten Lasts apiece  This Fishingfair began on  Michaelmasday  and lasts all the Month of  October  by which time the Herrings draw off to Sea shoot their Spawn and are no more fit for the Merchants Business at least not those that are taken hereabouts  We have very different Accounts of the Quantity of Herrings caught here in this Season some have said that the Towns of  Yarmouth  and  Leostoff  only have taken Lasts in a Season I will not venture to confirm that Report but I have heard  the Merchants themselves say that they have cured Barrels of merchantable red Herrings in one Season which tho' far short of the other is a very considerable Article and it is to be added that these are over and above all the Herrings consumed in the Country Towns of both those populous Counties for Miles from the Sea whither very great Quantities are carried every Tide during the whole Season  But this is only one Branch of the great Trade carried on in this Town another Part of its Commerce is in the exporting these Herrings after they are cured and for this its Merchants have a great Trade to  Genoa Leghorn Naples Messina  and  Venice  as also to  Spain  and  Portugal  exporting likewise with their Herrings great Quantities of Worsted Stuffs and Stuffs made of Silk and Worsted Camblets  c  the Manufactures of the neighbouring City of  Norwich  and of the Places adjacent  Besides this they carry on a very considerable Trade with  Holland  exporting a vast Quantity of Woollen Manufactures every Year Also they have a Fishingtrade to the North Seas for white Fish which from the Place are called the North Sea Cod  They have likewise a considerable Trade to  Norway  and to the  Baltick  from whence they bring back Deals and Fir Timber Oaken Plank Baulks Spars Oars Pitch Tar Hemp Flax Canvas and Sailcloth with all manner of Naval Stores for which they generally have a Consumption in their own Port where they build a very great Number of Ships every Year besides refitting and repairing the old  Add to this the Coaltrade between  Newcastle  and the River of  Thames  in which they are so improved of late Years that they have now a greater Share of it than any other Town in  England  and have quite worked the  Ipswich  Men out of it who had  formerly the chief Share of the Colliery in their Hands  For the carrying on all these Trades they have a very great Number of Ships either of their own or employed by them and it may in some measure be judged of by this That in the Year I had an Account from the Town Register that there were then Sail of Ships using the Sea belonging to the Town besides such Ships as the Merchants of  Yarmouth  might be concerned in and be Partowners of belonging to any other Ports  To all this I must add without Compliment to the Town that the Merchants and even the generality of Traders of  Yarmouth  have a very good Reputation in Trade as well Abroad as at Home for fair and honourable Dealing and their Seamen as well Masters as Mariners are justly esteemed among the ablest and most expert Navigators in  England    This Town however populous and large had till lately but one Parishchurch dedicated to St  Nicolas  tho' it is very large It has a high Spire which is an useful Seamark It was built by that famous Bishop of  Norwich William Herbert  who flourished in the Reign of  William  II and  Henry  I  William  of  Malmsbury  calls him  Vir pecuniosus  from the Works of Charity and Munificence which he has left as Witnesses of his immense Riches for he built the Cathedral Church the Priory for Monks the Bishop's Palace and the Parishchurch of St  Leonard  all in  Norwich  this great Church at  Yarmouth  the Church of St  Margaret  at  Lynn  and of St  Mary  at  Elmham  He removed the Episcopal See from  Thetford  to  Norwich  and instituted the  Cluniack  Monks at  Thetford  and gave them or built them a House  But in the Reigns of Queen  Anne  and the late King  George  I two Acts passed for Building a new  Church or Chapel of Ease in  Yarmouth  and for enlightening the Streets of the Town and other Purposes all which is performed in so complete a manner as is worthy of the Place  Also in the Year an Act passed for Clearing Depthening Repairing Extending Maintaining and Improving the Haven and Piers of  Yarmouth  and for depthening and making more navigable the several Rivers emptying themselves at that Town and also for preserving of Ships wintering in the Haven from Accidents by Fire This Provision was a very necessary one for the Haven is so very commodious for the secure and safe lying of Ships in the Winter Season that several hundred Sail are yearly laid up and winter in it which lie so contiguous to one another and so near the Houses that in case of Fire not only the Ships but the Town would be in Danger of being totally destroyed  Here is one of the finest Marketplaces and the best served with Provisions in  England London  excepted The Streets are all exactly strait from North to South from Lanes or Alleys which they call  Rows  crossing them in strait Lines also from East to West so that it is the most regularbuilt Town in  England  and seems as if it had been erected all at once upon one uniform Plan  They have particular Privileges in this Town and a Jurisdiction by which they can try condemn and execute in especial Cases without waiting for a Warrant from Above and this they exerted once very smartly in executing a Captain of one of the King's Ships of War in the Reign of King  Charles  II for a Murder committed in the Street the Circumstance of which did indeed call for Justice but some thought they would not have ventured to exert their Power as they did however I never heard that the Government resented it or blamed them for it  It is a very well governed Town and I have nowhere in  England  observed the  Sabbathday  so exactly kept or the Breach of it so constantly punished as in this Place which I mention to their Honour  From  Yarmouth  I resolved to pursue my first Design  viz  To view the Seaside on this Coast which is particularly noted for being one of the most dangerous and most fatal to the Sailors in all  Britain  and the more so because of the great Number of Ships which are continually going and coming this Way in their Passage between  London  and all the Northern Coasts of  Great Britain    The Reason of which is that the Shore from the Mouth of the River of  Thames  to  Yarmouth  Road lies in a strait Line from Southsoutheast to Northnorthwest the Land being on the West or Larboard Side From  Wintertonness  which is the utmost easterly Point of Land in the County of  Norfolk  and about four Miles beyond  Yarmouth  the Shore falls off for near Miles to the West as far as  Lynn  and  Boston  till the Shore of  Lincolnshire  tends North again for about Miles more as far as the  Humber  whence the Coast of  Yorkshire  or  Holderness  which is the EastRiding shoots out again into the Sea to the  Spurn  and to  Flambro' Head  as far East almost as the Shore of  Norfolk  had given back at  Winterton  making a very deep Gulph or Bay between those two Points of  Winterton  and the  Spurn Head  so that the Ships going North are obliged to stretch away to Sea from  Wintertonness  and leaving the Sight of Land in the deep Bay I have mentioned that reaches to  Lynn  and the Shore of  Lincolnshire  they go as I observed North or still Northnorthwest to meet the Shore of  Holderness  which as I said runs out into the Sea again at the  Spurn  this they leave also and the first Land they make is called as above  Flambro' Head  so that  Wintertonness  and  Flambro' Head  are the two Extremes of this Course  There is indeed the  Spurn Head  between but as it lies too far in towards the  Humber  they keep out to the North to avoid coming near it  In like manner the Ships which come from the North leave the Shore at  Flambro' Head  and stretch away Southsoutheast for  Yarmouth  Roads and the first Land they make is  Wintertonness  as above Now the Danger of the Place is this If the Ships coming from the North are taken with a hard Gale of Wind from the Southeast or from any Point between Northeast and Southeast so that they cannot weather  Wintertonness  they are thereby kept within that deep Bay and if the Wind blows hard are often in Danger of running on Shore upon the Rocks about  Cromere  on the Northcoast of  Norfolk  or stranding upon the flat Shore between  Cromere  and  Wells  All the Relief they have is good Groundtackle to ride it out which is very hard to do there the Sea coming very high upon them or if they cannot ride it out then to run into the Bottom of the great Bay to  Lynn  or  Boston  which is a very difficult and desperate Push so that sometimes in this Distress whole Fleets have been lost here all together  In the same Danger are Ships going Northward for if after passing by  Winterton  they are taken short with a Northeast Wind and cannot put back into the Roads which very often happens they are driven upon the same Coast and embay'd just as the latter The Danger on the Northpart of this Bay is not the same because if Ships going or coming should be taken short on this side  Flambro'  there is the River  Humber  open to them and several good Roads to have recourse to as  Burlington  Bay  Grimsby  Road the  Spurn  Head and others where they ride under Shelter  The Dangers of this Place being thus considered 'tis no wonder that upon the Shore beyond  Yarmouth    there are no less than Four Lighthouses kept flaming every Night besides the Lights at  Castor  North of the Town and at  Goulston  South All which are to direct the Sailors to keep a good Offing in case of bad Weather and to prevent their running into  Cromerebay  which the Seamen call the  Devil's Throat    As I went by Land from  Yarmouth  Northwest along the Shore towards  Cromere  aforesaid and was not then fully Master of the Reason of these things I was surprised to see in all the Way from  Winterton  that the Farmers and Country People had scarce a Barn Shed Stable or Pales to their Yards and Gardens or a Hogstye or Necessaryhouse but what was built of old Planks Beams Wales and Timber  c  the deplorable Wrecks of Ships and Ruins of Mariners and Merchants Fortunes and in some Places were whole Yards filled and piled up very high with the same Stuff laid up for the like building Purposes  About the Year there was a melancholy Example of what I have said of this Place A Fleet of Sail of light Colliers went out of  Yarmouth  Roads with a fair Wind to pursue their Voyage and were taken short with a Storm of Wind at Northeast After they were past  Wintertonness  a few Leagues some of them whose Masters made a better Judgment of Things or who were not so far out as the rest tacked and put back in time and got safe into the Roads but the rest pushing on in hopes to keep out to Sea and weather it were by the Violence of the Storm driven back when they were too far embay'd to weather  Wintertonness  a above and so were forced to run West every one shifting for themselves as well as they could some run away for  Lynn Deeps  but few of them the Night being so dark could find their Way thither some but very few rid it out at a Distance the  rest being above Sail were all driven on Shore and dashed to Pieces and very few of the People on Board were saved At the very same unhappy Juncture a Fleet of loaden Ships were coming from the North and being just crossing the same Bay were forcibly driven into it not able to weather the  Ness  and so were involved in the same Ruin as the light Fleet was also some coasting Vessels loaden with Corn from  Lynn  and  Wells  and bound for  Holland  were with the same unhappy Luck just come out to begin their Voyage and some of them lay at Anchor these also met with the same Misfortune so that in the whole above Sail of Ships and above People were lost in the Disaster of that one miserable Night very few escaping  Cromere  is a Markettown close to the Shore of this dangerous Coast I know nothing it is famous for besides its being thus the Terror of the Sailors except good Lobsters which are taken on that Coast in great Numbers and carried to  Norwich  and in such Quantities sometimes too as to be conveyed by Sea to  London    Farther within the Land and between this Place and  Norwich  are several good Markettowns and a great many Villages all diligently applying to the Woollen Manufacture and the Country is exceeding fertile as well in Corn as Pasture particularly which was very pleasant to see the Pheasants were in such great Plenty as to be seen in the Stubble like Cocks and Hens a Testimony tho' by the way that the County had more Tradesmen than Gentlemen in it Indeed this Part is so intirely given up to Industry that what with the Seafaringmen on the one Side and the Manufactures on the other we saw no idle Hands here but every Man busy Some of the principal of these Towns are    Hickling  and  NorthWaltham  noted only for a Market each    Alsham  a poor Town noted for Knitters    Worsted  for the Invention and twisting of Yarn so called also famed for Stockens and Stuffs    Catton  noted for a brazen Hand being carried before the Steward of the Demesne instead of a Mace and for a Bridge over the  Duze      Reepham  for a good Maltmarket having no Church at all out of three for there are only the Ruins of one of them standing    Holt  for giving two Lord Mayors of the Name of  Gresham  who were Brothers to  London  in and    Fakenham  noted for nothing at all but formerly for having Saltpits and    St Faiths  whither the Drovers bring their Black Cattle to sell to the  Norfolk  Graziers as I observed above  Not far from  Cromere  is  Gresham  the Birthplace of the generous Founder of the  Royal Exchange  and  Gresham Col  ge London    From  Cromere  we rode on the Strand or open Shore to  Weyburn Hope  the Shore so flat that in some Places the Tide ebbs out near two Miles From  Weyburn  West lies  Clye  where there are large Saltworks and very good Salt made which is sold all over the County and sometimes sent to  Holland  and  ick  From  Clye  we go to  Marham  and to  Wells  all Towns on the Coast in each whereof there is a very considerable Trade carried on with  Holland  for Corn which that Part of the County is very full of besides the great Trade driver here from  Holland  back again which I take to be a Trade carried on with much less Honesty than Advantage especially while the Art of Smuggling was so much in Practice which the Laws have of late  rendered more difficult than it was tho' far from suppressing it  The Seven Burnhams  which are so many small Towns called by the same Name and each employed in the same  Holland  Trade as  Marham  and  Wells  lie on and near the Seacoast to the Northwest of  Walsingham    From the Seacoast we turned to the Southwest thro'  Snetham  a small Markettown to  CastleRising  an old decayed Borough Town with hardly Ten Families in it which yet sends Two Members to Parliament but shews a great many Marks of  Roman Saxon  and  Danish  Antiquities in and about it  On our Left we saw  Walsingham  an antient Town famous for the old Ruins of a Monastery there and the Shrine of our Lady as noted as that of St  ThomasaBecket  at  Canterbury  hence called  Our Lady of Walsingham  Two Wells here are still called by the Name of the  Blessed Virgin    Near this Place at  Raynham  is the Seat of the Lord Viscount  Townshend  and not far distant at  Houghton  that noble newbuilt one of Sir  Robert Walpole  the Gardens and Plantations of which are very large and beautiful  The general Plan and Front of the House and Offices extend to Feet the great Hall is a Circle of Feet the Salon by Feet and all the other Rooms in the four great Apartments are Feet high the Attick Story is Feet high and the Rustick Story the same all above Ground under which is an intire Story of Cellars all arched The Front to the great Entrance extends to Feet lying open to the Park The Building is finished with two Towers dressed with two Rustick  Venetian  Windows The Section of the great Hall all in Stone the most beautiful in  England  The whole Building is of Stone and without pretending  to excuse any seeming or real Defect it may be truly said to be a House of State and Conveniency worthy of a Prince's Residence  This stately Structure begun in the Year was completely finished Inside and Outside in the Year the noble Founder having had the singular Felicity all the time to continue at the Helm of Affairs as he does still  Anno    On the Foundationstone placed in the Southeast Angle is this Inscription  Hic me posuit  ROBERTUS  ille  WALPOLE  Quem tu non nescies Posteritas  Fandamen ut essem Demus  In Agro Natali extruendae    o  die Maii A D  MDCCXXII  Faxit Deus  Postquam nea urus aevi Dominus  Diu laetatu fuerit ab  lutâ  Incolumens tueantur incolumes  Ad summam Diem  Et Nati Natorum qui nascentur  ab illis  Which may be  Englished  thus    Here that Sir  ROBERT WALPOLE  with whom O Posterity thou shalt not be unacquainted has fixed me to stand as the Foundation of a Seat designed to be built in his native County the th Day of  May  in the Year God grant that after its Master to a mature Old Age shall have long enjoy'd it in Perfection his latest Descendants may safely and securely possess it to the End of Time  The noble Founder had doubtless in his Thoughts in this Inscription the uncertain State of Prime Ministers and of the superb Structures built by them in the Height of their Power in all Ages and Countries and we hope the Merits of him and his Descendants to their native Country may induce the Almighty to give a  Fiat  to his Prayer  We proceeded hence to  Lynn  another rich and populous Porttown well built and well situated at the Mouth of the River  Ouse  which has the greatest Extent of inland Navigation of any Port in  England London  excepted The Reason whereof is that more navigable Rivers empty themselves here into the Sea including the Washes  which are Branches of the same Port than at any one Mouth of Waters in  England  except the  Thames  and the  Humber  By these navigable Rivers the Merchants of  Lynn  supply about six Counties wholly and three Counties in Part with their Goods especially Wine and Coals  viz  By the little  Ouse  they send their Goods to  Brandon  and  Thetford  by the Lake to  Mildenhall BartonMills  and  St Edmundsbury  by the River  Grant  to  Cambridge  by the great  Ouse  itself to  Ely  to  St Ives  to St  Neots  to  Barfordbridge  and to  Bedford  by the River  Nyne  to  Peterboro  ' by the Drains and Washes to  Wisbich  to  Spalding Marketdeeping  and  Stamford  besides the several Counties into which these Goods are carried by Land Carriage from the Places where the Navigation of those Rivers ends which has given Rise to this Observation on the Town of  Lynn  That they bring in more Coals than any Seaport between  London  and  Newcastle  and import more Wines than any Port in  England  except  London  and  Bristol  their Trade to  Norway  and to the  Baltick Sea  is also great in Proportion and of late Years they have extended it farther to the Southward  There are many Gentry and consequently more Gayety in this Town than in  Yarmouth  or even  Norwich  the Place abounding in very good Company and indeed it is so considerable that it merits as particular a Description as the Nature of this Work will admit and which therefore I will give as succinctly as I can  To begin then This Town was first called  LynnEpiscopi  as the Property of the Bishop of  Norwich  till the Dissolution of Monasteries by King  Henry  VIII when that Prince becoming its Possessor conferred on it the Name of  Lynn Regis    It is situated towards the Mouth of the  Great Ouse  encompassed with a deep Trench walled almost all round containing about Houses and divided by four Rivulets arched over with about Bridges It extends along the Eastside of the River which in high Springtides flows above Feet perpendicular and is about the Breadth of the  Thames  above Bridge for the Length of a Mile and is divided into nine Wards On the Northend towards the Sea stands  St Anne's Fort  with a Platform of large Guns commanding all Ships which pass by the Harbour and towards the Land besides the Wall there are nine regular Bastions and a Ditch nearly in the Form of a Semicircle which make it above half a Mile in Breadth The Town is so antient as to be supposed the same with  MaidenBower  according to several old Historians  It has many remarkable Places which deserve a more particular Description than I have Room for however I shall touch upon them briefly as  St Margaret  's Church the  Townhall Bridewell  the  Customhouse  and  Exchange  the  Marketcross St Nicolas  's Chapel  AllSaints  Church the  FreeSchool  the  Hospitals  the Statue of King  James  II King  John  's Sword and Cup the common  Stathyard  the  Lady's Mount  the publick Libraries the King's  Stathyard  and other Remarkables of which in their Order and first of  St Margarets  Church  This Church which was formerly an Abbey and is one of the largest Parochial Churches in  England  is adorned with a very fair and high Lanthorn covered with Lead containing the Clockbell lately cast which may be heard all over the Town Its Height is Feet At the Westend stands a Stone Tower Feet high and facing the Street a Moondial designed to tell the Increase and Decrease of that Planet with the exact Hour of the Day▪ It moves by Clockwork Over the Tower is a  Spire Feet high in form of a Pyramid near to which is the Belltower built of Freestone Feet high containing a Ring of eight Bells In this Church is kept the Bishop's Court when he comes hither on his Visitation  The Townhouse called  Trinityhall  is an antient and noble Building which makes a fine Appearance  Adjoining to it is the House of Correction called  Bridewell  with Apartments proper for the Reception of such as are put there who beat and dress Hemp during their Confinement  The  Exchange  is a fair Structure of Freestone with two Orders of Columns situated in the Middle of the Town and built at the Expence of Sir  John Turner  Knight and within it is the  Customhouse  containing several commodious Apartments  The  Markethouse  is a new Edifice of Freestone in the modern Taste Feet high erected on four Steps neatly adorned with Statues and other Embellishments with an Inscription giving an Account of its former Condition and present Rebuilding  St Nicolas  's Chapel is very antient and stands at the Northend of the Town It is an Appendage to  St Margaret  's and is esteemed one of the fairest and largest religious Fabricks in  England  it has a Belltower of Freestone and a pyramidical octangular Spire over it both which together are Feet from the Ground  AllSaints  Church in  SouthLynn  belonged formerly to the  Carmelite  and  White  Friers on the Ruins of whose Monastery it is built Tho' not large it is neat solid and regular in form of a Cross within a Churchyard well walled in  On the Northside of  St Margaret  's Churchyard is the  Freeschool  a strong and beautiful Building  The only Fabrick formerly belonging to any religious Order now standing is the  GreyFryers  Steeple a noted Seamark which was repaired and  amended out of the Ruins of a demolished Chapel in the Year It may not be amiss to mention here a remarkable and laudable Order that was made in the Year That on every first  Monday  in the Month there should be a Meeting of the Mayor Aldermen some of the CommonCouncil and the Preachers in order to settle Peace and Quietness between Man and Man and to decide all manner of Controversies this was called  The Feast of Reconciliation    In the Parish of  AllSaints  is a small  Hospital  for four poor Men to live rentfree  St Mary Magdalen  's  Hospital  founded in the Reign of King  Stephen  for a Prior and Brethren and Sisters continued in a flourishing Condition about Years and devolved to the Crown at the making the Statute for Dissolution of religious Houses in the Reign of  Edward  VI in whose Time it was robbed and almost levelled with the Ground by  Kett  's Mutineers at their Return from their frustrated Attempt to surprise  Lynn  so that it remained destitute of Brethren and Sisters except some poor People whom the Mayor and Burgesses maintained with Design to support the antient Hospital till King  James  I upon Petition restored them their Lands granted them many Privileges and incorporated them but in the Year it was a second time destroy'd by Fire by the Earl of  Manchester  's Forces when they besieged  Lynn  then standing out for the King In the Year the Corportation rebuilt it very commodiously as at present with two Courts a Chapel and convenient Apartments for the Master Brethren and Sisters and several Inscriptions commemorating the late Disaster It is now committed to the Care of Two of the Elder Aldermen chosen for that Purpose by the other Governors  There is in the great Marketplace a Statue erected in the Year to the Honour of King  James  II  with an Inscription that may serve for a Satire on the undue Compliments which are frequently paid to Princes during the Time of their Prosperity It stands on a Pedestal which has several Embellishments and is inclosed within a Palisade of Iron The Inscription is as follows  Non immemor  Quantum Divinis invictiss Principis  JACOBI II  Virtutibus debeat  Hanc Regiae Majestatis Effigiem  Aeternum Fidei et Obsequii  Monumentum erexit  S P Q L  Anno Salutis    In  English  thus  The Aldermen and Common Council of  Lynn  not forgetting how much they owe to the divine Virtues of the invincible King  James  II as a lasting Monument of their Faith and Loyalty have erected this Statue of his Royal Majesty  Anno    In an old ruinous Building which was once a Chapel was by the Corporation and other Inhabitants made a publick Receptacle for poor Children to learn to spin Wooll here they are also taught to read It is now by Act of Parliament settled and vested in the Guardians of the Poor  There was a Church formerly in the Town dedicated to St  John  and belonging to the Hospital of that Name both which are alike extinct  The Corporation boasts of having been presented by King  John  with a very rich doublegilt Cup and Cover weighing Ounces which is preserved to this Day and used on publick Occasions and at the same time a large Sword with a Silver Mounting from his own Side as is engraven on the Inscription on the Hilt  The Entrance into the common  Stathyard  from the  Tuesday  Market is by two large Gateways with habitable Rooms over them It is a beautiful large square Area with a commodious Quay or Wharf surrounded with Warehouses and Granaries for all sorts of Merchandize with spacious Vaults  At a small Distance from the Town stands a ruinous Pile called  The Lady's Mount  or  Red Mount  wherein formerly was a Chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin which served as a Receptacle for Pilgrims travelling this Way towards the celebrated Convent of  Our Lady  at  Walsingham    The Library at  St Nicolas  was erected by a voluntary Subscription of several Hundred Pounds to which the late Lord  Townshend  who took his Title of Baron from this Town Sir  Robert Walpole  Sir  Charles Turner  and  Robert Britiffe    Esq  deceased were considerable Benefactors There is also another Library at  St Margaret  's to which the late  Thomas Thurlin  D D President of  St John  's in  Cambridge  bequeathed all his Books and also left an Exhibition of Six Pounds a Year to a poor Scholar who should go from the Grammarschool to  St John  's College in  Cambridge  and forty Shillings yearly towards the Cloathing three of the poorest Inhabitants of  Gaywood  c  The Inhabitants of  Lynn  suffer great Inconvenience from the want of freshwater Springs within the Town with which Element however they are supplied from a River running by  Gaywood  and by leaden Pipes from  Middleton  and  Mintling    The Church of  St Edmund  in  NorthLynn  was long ago intirely swallowed up by the Sea  The King's  Stathyard  is a very handsome Square with Brick Buildings fronting each Way in the Centre of which stands the Statue of  James  I in a Nich fronting the West Here the greatest Part of imported Wines are landed as it has a convenient Quay and large Winevaults  At the Southend of the Town stood an Oilmill framed in  Holland  and brought over hither near Years ago It gave a pleasant Prospect to every Part of the Town but in the Year was consumed by Fire  From what has been said it will be observed that the Situation of this Town renders it capable of being made very strong and in the late Wars it was so a Line of Fortification being drawn round it at a Distance from the Walls the Ruins or rather Remains of which Works appear to this Day nor would it be a hard Matter to restore the Bastions with the Ravelins and Counterscarp upon any sudden Emergency to a good State of Defence especially because they are able to fill all their Ditches with Water from the Sea in such a manner as that it cannot be drawn off  They pass over here in Boats into the Fen Country and over the famous Washes into  Lincolnshire  but the Passage is very dangerous and uneasy for here Passengers often miscarry and are lost but then it is usually on their venturing at improper times and without the Guides which if they would be persuaded not to do they would very rarely fail of going or coming safe  From  Lynn  I bent my Course Southward to  Downham  where is an ugly wooden Bridge over the  Ouse  at which as  Hollingshead  informs us in  October  were taken monstrous Fishes from to Feet long  When we were at  Downham  we took a Turn to the antient Town of  Thetford  situated partly in  Norfolk  and partly in  Suffolk  It was raised on the Ruins of the antient  Sitomagus  which was destroy'd by the  Danes  It is at present but meanly built but by the Ruins of Churches and Monasteries still remaining appears to have been formerly of great Account and even so far back as the Time of King  Edward the Confessor  it had Burgesses and in that of  William the Conqueror  Mansions On the  Suffolk  Side there now remain the Ruins of six Churches and Monasteries and there were several others in the Town but now there are but three  Parish Churches standing intire one on the  Suffolk  and two on the  Norfolk  Side It is however a Town Corporate governed by a Mayor Aldermen and Commoncouncil has three annual Fairs a plentiful weekly Market and is a kind of See suffragan to that of  Norwich  In the th Year of King  James  I an Act passed for the Founding of an Hospital a Grammarschool and Maintenance of a Preacher in this Town for ever according to the last Will of Sir  Richard Fulmarston  And Sir  Joseph Williamson  Secretary of State to King  Charles  II built here a new Councilhouse and was otherwise a good Benefactor to the Place The  Lent  Assizes are usually held here  From  Thetford  we crossed the  Ouse  to  Brandon  which gives the Title of an  English  Duke to Duke  Hamilton  of  Scotland  This is no illbuilt Town and has a good Church belonging to it It gave a Lord Mayor to  London Anno    viz  Sir  Simon Eyre  Draper who built  Leadenhall  for the Use of the City and left Marks a very great Sum in those Days to charitable Uses  Brandon  has lost its Market but stands conveniently upon the  Ouse  over which it has a Bridge and a Ferry to convey Goods to and from the Isle of  Ely  to which we directly bent our Course  We made an Excursion from  Ely  Northwards up to the  Fens  but we saw nothing that Way worth our Curiosity or remarking but deep Roads vast Drains and Dykes of Water which are all navigable but with all this a very rich Soil bearing a great Quantity of Hemp but a bad unwholsome Air  Wisbich  however which lies on the Northern Extremity of the County has not only been of Note in the Conqueror's Time who built a Castle here but is now a wellbuilt Markettown has a good Townhall and is esteemed the best Tradingtown in the Isle as having the Convenience of good  Watercarriage to  London  whither they send great Quantities of Oil and Butter and bring back all sorts of Commodities with which the whole Isle is furnished for it has a plentiful Market  A good way lower down to the South are the two Markettowns of  Mersh  and  Thorney  the first is very inconsiderable the other is delightfully situated and the Land about it very fruitful in Grass and Trees  The  Isle of Ely  is encompassed with the  Ouse  and other Waters The City is situated on a Hill in the Middle of a great Plain It is full of Springs insomuch that in the principal Street in the East Part of the Town there are Wells bricked up Kneehigh almost at every hundred Yards which the whole Year generally overflow from one to another all the way down the Declivity of the Hill on which the Town stands The Soil is exceeding rich and the City is encompassed with Gardens the Produce of which is so excellent that it furnishes all the County for Miles round even as far as  Cambridge  and  St Ives  the former of which has almost all its Gardenstuff from hence Great Quantities of Strawberries are cultivated here particularly of the white Wood sort  The most remarkable thing that I observed of the Minster was that it is seen for many Miles round but is so old that it seems to totter with every high Gust of Wind  On the Eastside of the  Cam  a little below  Ely  stands  Soham  a little Markettown towards the Borders of  Suffolk  near the Marshes which were formerly dangerous to pass but now there is a Causey made which leads very securely over them Here are the Remains of an antient Church which was ruined by the  Danes    We proceeded from hence to  Newmarket  Near  Snaybell  as we went we saw a noble Seat of Admiral  Russel  created Earl of  Orford  for the glorious Victory obtained under his Command over the  French  Fleet and the burning their Ships at  La Hogue    The Situation of this House is low and on the Edge of the Fen Country but the Building is fine the Apartments noble and the Gardens wellfinished On the Earl's Death it devolved to  Samuel Sandys    Esq  in Right of his Wife one of the Earl's Heirs who now possesses it  Arriving at  Newmarket  in the Month of  October  I had the Opportunity to see the Horseraces and a great Concourse of the Nobility and Gentry as well from  London  as from all Parts of  England  but they were all so intent so eager so busy upon what is called the sharping Part of the Sport of Wagers and Bets that to me they seemed rather like so many Horsecoursers in  Smithfield  than Persons of Dignity and Quality who descend so low as even to circumvent one another and if I may speak it pick one another's Pockets To see a Person of Distinction who perhaps being ennobled his Word of Honour by the Laws of the Land is to be esteemed and received with equal Sanction as an Oath in our Courts of Justice level himself with a Groom or a Ridingboy and put his Credit and Honour in his Hands with a Bribe to betray his Master and his Trust is a thing scarce credible among those who are really Men of Honour and yet it is too often the Case to the indelible Shame of Men of Rank and Quality be it spoken in particular and to the Reproach of the Nation in general How different is this Conduct from that of those in the  Circus  at  Rome  How much more different from those who gained so much Honour in the  Grecian  Races What  Pindar  could be found in these Days to celebrate them What must his Subject be Tricks and Circumventions Alas How degenerate And yet these Races were instituted with  a very good Intent to raise an Emulation in our Nobility and Gentry to keep up and preserve a Race of good Horses in Honour of the Nation in general but as the Institution is debased it is not the best Horse that wins the Race but that which is destined for it by a Combination  Before I was let into the Secret as 'tis called which is indeed nothing but the knavish Part of the Sport I was much diverted with these Races but when I was I rejoiced not a little at the Regulation that it has met with from the Power that only had Authority to make it For this Diversion becoming a publick Nuisance by spreading itself in little Matches all over the Kingdom the Legislature took Cognizance of it and in the th of King  George  II a Law passed which injoins as follows  viz  That none but the Owners of Horses shall enter them and but one Horse at a Time  That no Plate under  l  Value shall be run for on Penalty of  l  and  l  to such as shall advertise print or publish any Advertisement of a Plate to be run for of less Value than  l  Five Years old Horses to carry Stone Six Seven on the Forfeiture of the Horse and  l  The Race to be begun and ended in one Day  Matches to be at  Newmarket  and  BlackHambleton Yorkshire  only on Penalty of  l  But Gifts left for annual Races not to be alter'd  Somersetshire  Penalties to go to  Bath Hospital    Entrance Money to be paid to the secondbest Horse  I went in the Intervals of the Sport to see the fine Seats of the Gentlemen in the neighbouring County for this Part of  Suffolk  being an open champain Country and in a healthy Air is formed for Pleasure and all kinds of rural Diversion Nature  as it were inviting the Gentlemen to visit her where she is plentifully furnished to receive them and the Country is accordingly in a manner covered with fine Palaces of the Nobility and pleasant Seats of the Gentry  Eustonhall  the Seat of the Duke of  Grafton  lies in the open Country towards the Side of  Norfolk  not far from  Thetford  a Place capable of all that is pleasant and delightful in Nature and greatly improved by Art  From thence I went to  Rushbrook  formerly the Seat of the noble Family of  Jermyns  lately Lord  Dover  and now of the House of  Davers  Then we saw  Brently  the Seat of the Earl of  Dysert  and the antient Palace of my Lord  Cornwallis  with several others most agreeably situated and adorned with the Beautiesboth of Art and Nature  Newmarket  is a handsome wellbuilt Town and being a Thoroughfare reaps no small Advantage by that means as well as from the Races It consists chiefly of one long Street the Northside of which is in  Suffolk  and the South in  Cambridgeshire  The King has a House of his own where he resides when he thinks fit to come to the Races The Town has two Churches belonging to it and a Freeschool endowed by King  Charles  II  We entered  Cambridgeshire  out of  Suffolk  with all the Advantage that can be imagined just upon those pleasant and agreeable Plains called  NewmarketHeath  Across which extends a Fortification or Ditch with a Rampart commonly called  The Devil's Dyke  as Works of an extraordinary Nature are generally by the Vulgar attributed to that Prince of Darkness thro' the Nation but among the Gentry it is best known by the Name of  Rech Dyke  from  Rech  a small Markettown lying near the Heath It is supposed to have been the Boundary of the Kingdom of the  EastAngles    Passing this Ditch we see from the Hills called  Gogmagog  or rather  Hogmagog  a rich and pleasant Vale Westward covered with Cornfields Gentlemens Seats Villages and at a Distance to crown all the rest that antient and truly famous Town and University of  Cambridge  Capital of the County  Cambridgeshire  except the Fen Country is almost wholly a Corn Country and of that Corn five Parts in six of all they sow is Barley which is generally sold to  Ware  and  Royston  and other great Maltingtowns in  Hertfordshire  and is the Fund from whence that vast Quantity of Malt called  Hertfordshire  Malt is made which is esteemed the best in  England  As  Essex Suffolk  and  Norfolk  are taken up in Manufactures and famed for Industry this County has no Manufacture at all nor are the Poor except the Husbandmen noted for any thing so much as Idleness and Sloth to their Scandal be it spoken What the Reason of it is I know not  On the Top of  Hogmagog Hills  appears an antient Camp or Fortification with a treble Rampart and Ditch which most of our Writers say was neither  Roman  nor  Saxon  but  British  King  James  II caused a spacious Stable to be built in the Area of this Camp for his Runninghorses and made old Mr  Frampton  Master or Inspector of them The Stables remain still there tho' they are not often made use of The Earl  Godolphin  has here a fine House on the very Summit of the Hill to which his Lordship frequently resorts especially in the Racingseason  As we descended Westward we saw the Fen Country on our Right almost all covered with Water like a Sea The  Michaelmas  Rains having been very great that Year sent down vast Floods of Water from the Upland Countries and those Fens being the Sink of no less than Counties they are often thus overflowed The Rivers which thus empty themselves into these Fens and carry off the  Water are the  Cam  or  Grant  the  Great Ouse  and  Little Ouse  the  Nene  the  Welland  and the River which runs from  Bury  to  Mildenhall  The Counties which these Rivers drain as above are those of  Lincoln  *  Cambridge  *  Huntingdon  *  Bedford  Warwick  Oxford  Leicester  *  Northampton  Rutland  Norfolk  Suffolk  and  Essex  Those mark'd with * empty  all  their Waters this Way the rest but  in Part  In a Word all the Water of the Middle Part of  England  which does not run into the  Thames  or the  Trent  comes down into these Fens  In these Fens are abundance of those admirable Pieces of Art call'd  Duckoys  and it is incredible what Quantities of Wildfowl of all sorts Duck Mallard Teal Wigeon  c  they take in them every Week during the Season It may indeed be guessed at in some measure by this that there is a Duckoy not far from  Ely  which yields the Landlord  l  a Year clear of the Charge of maintaining a great Number of Servants for the Management from whence alone they assured me at  St Ives  a Town on the  Ouse  whither the Fowls are always brought to be conveyed to  London  that they generally sent up Couples a Week  There are more of these about  Peterborough  from whence Waggon Loads are sent up twice a Week to  London  I have seen these Waggons before the Act of Parliament to regulate Carriers drawn by ten or twelve Horses apiece they were loaden so heavy  As these Fens appear overwhelm'd with Water I observed that they generally at this latter Part of the Year appear also covered with Fogs so that when the Downs and higher Grounds of the adjacent Country glistered with the Beams of the Sun  the  Isle of Ely  seemed wrapped up in Mist and Darkness so that nothing could be discerned but now and then the Cupola of  Ely  Minster  One could hardly see this from the Hills without Concern for the many thousand Families confined to those Fogs who had no other Breath to draw than what must be mixed with the choaking Vapours which spread over all the Country but notwithstanding this the People especially those that are used to it live as healthy as those in a clearer Air except nowandthen an Ague which they make light of and there are great Numbers of very antient People among them An Act passed a few Years ago for the effectual Draining and Preservation of  Haddenham Level  in the  Isle of Ely  which contains Acres which were overflowed chiefly thro' the Neglect of preserving and clearing the Outfalls into the Sea and as these Grounds are naturally very rich and fertile it may be imagined what a Benefit must accrue to the Publick by this means when the Draining and Recovery of them can be completed  Having been at  Sturbridgefair  when it was in its Height in the Month of  September  the Year before I was at  Newmarket  I must say that it is not only the greatest in the whole Nation but I think in  Europe  nor is the Fair at  Leipsick  in  Saxony  the Mart at  Frankfort  on the  Main  or the Fairs at  Nuremberg  or  Ausburg  reputed any way comparable to this at  Sturbridge  This Fair is pretty much dwindled since this Account of it tho' it is still very considerable    It is kept in a large Cornfield near  Casterton  extending from the Side of the River  Cam  towards the Road for about half a Mile square  If the Field be not cleared of the Corn before a certain Day in  August  the Fairkeepers may trample it underfoot to build their Booths or Tents On  the other hand to balance that Severity if the Fairkeepers have not cleared the Field by another certain Day in  September  the Plowmen may reenter with Plow and Cart and overthrow all into the Dirt and as for the Filth Dung Straw  c  left behind by the Fairkeepers which is very considerable these become the Farmers Fees and make them full Amends for the trampling riding carting upon and hardening the Ground  It is impossible to describe all the Parts and Circumstances of this Fair exactly the Shops are placed in Rows like Streets whereof one is called  Cheapside  and here as in several other Streets are all Sorts of Traders who sell by Retale and come chiefly from  London  Here may be seen Goldsmiths Toymen Brasiers Turners Milaners Haberdashers Hatters Mercers Drapers Pewterers Chinawarehouses and in a Word all Trades that can be found in  London  with Coffeehouses Taverns and Eatinghouses in great Numbers and all kept in Tents and Booths  This great Street reaches from the Road which as I said goes from  Cambridge  to  Newmarket  turning short out of it to the Right towards the River and holds in a Line near half a Mile quite down to the Riverside In another Street parallel with the Road are the like Rows of Booths but somewhat larger and more intermingled with Wholesale Dealers and one Side passing out of this last Street to the Lefthand is a great Square formed of the largest Booths called the  Duddery  but whence so called I could not learn The Area of this Square is from to Yards where the Dealers have room before every Booth to take down and open their Packs and to bring in Waggons to load and unload  This Place being peculiar to the Wholesale Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture the Booths  or Tents are of a vast Extent have different Apartments and the Quantities of Goods they bring are so great that the Insides of them look like so many  Blackwellhalls  and are vast Warehouses piled up with Goods to the Top In this  Duddery  as I have been informed have been sold Poundsworth of Woollen Manufactures in less than a Week's time besides the prodigious Trade carried on here by Wholesalemen from  London  and all Parts of  England  who transact their Business wholly in their Pocketbooks and meeting their Chapmen from all Parts make up their Accounts receive Money chiefly in Bills and take Orders These they say exceed by far the Sales of Goods actually brought to the Fair and delivered in Kind it being frequent for the  London  Wholesalemen to carry back Orders from their Dealers for Poundsworth of Goods a Man and some much more This especially respects those People who deal in heavy Goods as Wholesale Grocers Salters Brasiers Ironmerchants Winemerchants and the like but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen Manufactures and especially in Mercery Goods of all sorts who generally manage their Business in this manner  Here are Clothiers from  Halifax Leeds Wakefield  and  Huthersfield  in  Yorkshire  and from  Rochdale Bury  c in  Lancashire  with vast Quantities of  Yorkshire  Cloths Kerseys Pennistons Cottons  c  with all sorts of  Manchester  Ware Fustians and Things made of Cotton Wooll of which the Quantity is so great that they told me there were near Horsepacks of such Goods from that Side of the Country and these took up a Side and Half of the  Duddery  at least also a Part of a Street of Booths were taken up with Upholsters Ware such as Tickens Sackens  Kidderminster  Stuffs Blankets Rugs Quilts  c  In the  Duddery  I saw one Warehouse or Booth consisting of six Apartments all belonging to a Dealer in  Norwich  Stuffs only who they said had there above  l  Value in those Goods  Western Goods had their Share here also and several Booths were filled with Serges Duroys Druggets Shalloons Cantaloons  Devonshire  Kersies  c  from  Exeter Taunton Bristol  and other Parts West and some from  London  also  But all this is still outdone at least in Appearance by two Articles which are the Peculiars of this Fair and are not exhibited till the other Part of the Fair  for the Woollen Manufacture  begins to close up These are the WOOLL and the HOPS There is scarce any Price fixed for Hops in  England  till they know how they sell at  Sturbridgefair  the Quantity that appears in the Fair is indeed prodigious and they take up a large Part of the Field on which the Fair is kept to themselves they are brought directly from  Chelmsford  in  Essex  from  Canterbury  and  Maidstone  in  Kent  and from  Farnham  in  Surrey  besides what are brought from  London  of the Growth of those and other Places  Inquiring why this Fair should be thus of all other Places in  England  the Centre of that Trade and so great a Quantity of so bulky a Commodity be carried thither so far I was informed by one thoroughly acquainted with that Matter That Hops for this Part of  England  grow principally in the two Counties of  Surrey  and  Kent  with an Exception only to the Town of  Chelmsford  in  Essex  and there are very few planted anywhere else  There are indeed in the West of  England  some Hops growing as at  Wilton  near  Salisbury  at  Hereford  and  Broomsgrove  near  Wales  and the like but the Quantity is inconsiderable and the Places so remote that none of them come to  London    Formerly in the North of  England  few Hops were used their Drink being chiefly pale smooth Ale which required but little Hops and consequently they planted none North of  Trent  But as for some Years past they not only brew great Quantities of Beer in the North but also use Hops in the Brewing their Ale much more than they did before so they all come South of  Trent  to buy their Hops and here being vast Quantities brought 'tis great Part of their back Carriage into  Yorkshire  and  Northamptonshire Derbyshire Lancashire  and all those Counties nay of late since the Union even so far as  Scotland  for I must not omit here also to mention that the River  Grant  or  Cam  which runs close by the Northwest Side of the Fair in its Course from  Cambridge  to  Ely  is navigable and that by this means all heavy Goods are brought to the Fairfield by Watercarriage from  London  and other Parts first to the Port of  Lynn  and then in Barges up the  Ouse  from the  Ouse  into the  Cam  and so to the very Edge of the Fair  In like manner great Quantities of heavy Goods and Hops among the rest are sent from the Fair to  Lynn  by Water and shipped there for the  Humber  to  Hull York  c and for  Newcastle upon Tyne  and by  Newcastle  to  Scotland  Now as they do not yet plant Hops in the North tho' the Consumption there is great and increasing daily this is one Reason why at  Sturbridgefair  there is so great a Demand for them besides there were very few Hops if any worth naming growing in all the Counties even on this side  Trent  above Miles from  London  those Counties depending on  Sturbridgefair  for their Supply so the Counties of  Suffolk Norfolk Cambridge Huntingdon Northampton Lincoln Leicester Rutland  and even to  Stafford Warwick  and  Worcestershire  bought most of if not all their Hops at  Sturbridgefair    This is a Testimony of the prodigious Resort of the trading People of all Parts of  England  to this Fair where surprising Quantities of Hops formerly have been sold  The Article of Wooll is of several Sorts but principally Fleece Wooll out of  Lincolnshire  where the longest Staple is found the Sheep of those Parts being of the largest Breed  The Buyers are chiefly the Manufacturers of  Norfolk Suffolk  and  Essex  and it is a prodigious Quantity they buy  Here I saw what I have not observed in any other County of  England  a  Pocket  of Wooll which seems to have been at first called so in Mockery this  Pocket  being so big that it loads a whole Waggon and reaches beyond the most extreme Parts of it hanging over both before and behind and these ordinarily weigh a Ton or  lb  Weight of Wooll all in one Bag  The Quantity of Wooll only which has been sold at this Place at one Fair has been said to amount to or  l  in Value some say a great deal more  By these Articles a Stranger may make some Guess at the immense Trade which is carried on at this Place what prodigious Quantities of Goods are bought and sold and what a vast Concourse of People are seen here from all Parts of  England    I might proceed to speak of several other Sorts of  English  Manufactures which are brought hither to be sold as all Sorts of wrought Iron and Brass Ware from  Birmingham  edged Tools Knives  c  from  Sheffield  Glass Wares and Stockens from  Nottingham  and  Leicester  and unaccountable Quantities of other Things of smaller Value every Morning  To attend this Fair and the prodigious Crouds of People which resort to it there are sometimes no  less than Hackney Coaches which come from  London  and ply Night and Morning to carry the People to and from  Cambridge  for there the Gross of them lodge nay which is still more strange there are Wherries brought from  London  on Waggons to ply upon the little River  Cam  and to row People up and down from the Town and from the Fair as Occasion presents  It is not to be wondered at if the Town of  Cambridge  cannot receive or entertain the Numbers of People that come to this Fair for not  Cambridge  only but all the Towns round are full nay the very Barns and Stables are turned into Inns to lodge the meaner Sort of People As for the Fair People they all eat drink and sleep in their Booths which are so intermingled with Taverns Coffeehouses Drinkinghouses Eatinghouses Cooks Shops  c  and so many Butchers and Higglers from all the neighbouring Counties come in every Morning with Beef Mutton Fowls Butter Bread Cheese Eggs and such Things and go with them from Tent to Tent from Door to Door that there's no Want of Provisions of any Kind either dressed or undressed  In a Word the Fair is like a wellgoverned City and there is the least Disorder and Confusion I believe that can be seen anywhere with so great a Concourse of People  Towards the latter End of the Fair and when the great Hurry of Wholesale Business begins to be over the Gentry come in from all Parts of the County round and tho' they come for their Diversion yet 'tis not a little Money they lay out which generally falls to the Share of the Retalers such as the Toyshops Goldsmiths Brasiers Ironmongers Turners Milaners Mercers  c  and some loose Corns they reserve for the Puppetshews Drolls Ropedancers and suchlike of which there is no  Want The last Day of the Fair is the  Horsefair  where the Whole is closed both with Horse and Footraces to divert the meaner Sort of People only for nothing considerable is offered of that Kind and the late Act I presume must have put an End to the former Thus ends the whole Fair and in less than a Week more scarce any Sign is left that such a thing has been there except by the Heaps of Dung and Straw and other Rubbish which is left behind trod into the Earth and is as good as a Summer's Fallow for the Land and as I have said above pays the Husbandman well for the Use of it  I should have mentioned that here is a Court of Justice always open and held every Day in a Shed built on purpose in the Fair this is for keeping the Peace and deciding Controversies in Matters arising from the Business of the Fair The Magistrates of the Town of  Cambridge  are Judges in this Court as being in their Jurisdiction or they holding it by special Privilege Here they determine Matters in a summary way as is practised in those we call  PyePowder Courts  in other Places or as a  Court of Conscience  and they have a final Authority without Appeal  Having just mentioned the Puppetshews Drolls  c  with which the People are entertained during the Time of this Fair I cannot but relate a deplorable Accident that happened on this Occasion at  Barnwelt  in this Neighbourhood as follows  On the th of  September  about Eight at Night a Puppetshew being to be acted in a Barn built of  Barnwell  Stone and thatched with Straw a Fellow attempted to thrust himself in without paying but being refused and the Door locked and as some report nailed to keep out Intruders the Villain threatened he would set the Barn on Fire over their Heads in Revenge There was a Place adjoining to the Barn where were Hay and Straw and  a Boy setting down a wooden Lantern with a short Candle in it at a little Distance whilst he was looking thro' a Hole at the Sight the villainous Fellow aforesaid beat the Lantern about till the Fire took the Straw which he left burning and run away There was a Floor above them and the Flame getting into the false Roof spread like Wildfire The People in the utmost Consternation all making to the Door which opened inwards fell upon one another and became as it were so many Barricadoes to hinder its being opened and just at this fatal Crisis the Fire having seized some and dreadful Shrieks and Cries resounding from all the Floor fell in and smothered almost all for not above five or six escaped of the Whole and about Men Women and Children miserably perished The next Day it was one of the most shocking Sights that ever was beheld to see the Relations of the unhappy Persons flocking thither to find and own the Bodies some of their Brothers some of their Children some of their Wives and Husbands which they found Difficulty enough to discover for some of them had their Heads burnt off some their Legs some their Hands and Arms and others in a manner consumed to Ashes And at last most of the mangled Bodies were carried in Carts and put promiscuously into a large Hole dug in the Churchyard for that Purpose Among the unfortunate Sufferers were several young Gentlewomen of considerable Fortunes About four Years after this another terrible Fire happened which almost consumed the whole Town of  Barnwell    Within these few Years a fine Road of about four Miles in Length is completed from the Town of  Cambridge  to  Hogmagoghills  which by reason of the Badness of the Way in that Place is an exceeding useful Benefaction to the Town which generous Work was done in pursuance of the Will  of  William Wortes    Esq  of  Cambridge  as I think they told me the Gentleman's Name was  The Two Universities of  Cambridge  and  Oxford  are so much the Glory of this Nation that it would be an almost unpardonable Defect in me not to take particular Notice of them I shall refer that of  Oxford  to its proper Place and here give as brief an Account as I can of this of  Cambridge  and of the Originals and Founders of the several Colleges together with the Favours and Advantages that have been within these few Years conferred upon it by his late Majesty and other Benefactors  The Town is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen but with regard to the Government of the University that has a  Chancellor  eligible every three Years  aut manere in eodem Officio durante tacito consensu Senatus Cantabr  He hath under him a  Commissary  who holds a Court of Record of Civil Causes for all privileged Persons and Scholars under the Degree of Master of Arts  They have also a  High Steward  chosen by the Senate and holding by Patent from the University  The  ViceChancellor  is annually chosen on the th of  November  by the Body of the University out of Two Persons nominated by the Heads of Colleges  Two  Proctors  are also annually chosen as at  Oxford  as also are Two  Taxers  who with the Proctors have Cognizance of Weights and Measures as Clerks of the Market  The University has also a  Custos Archivorum  or  Register  Three  Esquire Beadles  One  Yeoman Beadle  and a  Librarykeeper    The Vicechancellor sometimes visits the Taverns and other Publickhouses in his own Person but the Proctors do it very frequently and have Power to punish offending Scholars and to fine the Publickhouses who entertain them after Eight at Night in the Winter or Nine in Summer  As to the  Antiquity  of the University of  Cambridge  the Story goes That  Cantaber  a  Spaniard  Years before Christ first founded it and that  Sebert  King of the  EastAngles  restored it  Anno Christi  Afterwards as the learned  Camden  observes it lay a long time neglected and was overthrown by the  Danish  Storms till all Things revived under the  Norman  Government Soon after Inns Hostels and Halls were built for Students tho' without Endowments There are now Colleges and Halls which differ only in Name being equally endowed and privileged Masters Fellowships about Scholarships Exhibitions and the whole Number of Masters Fellows Scholars Exhibitioners and other Students are about  I shall now give a brief Account of the Colleges and begin with  PETERHOUSE  Which was founded by  Hugh Balsham  Bishop of  Ely Anno  when only Prior of  Ely  But at first the Scholars had no other Conveniences than Chambers which exempted them from the high Rates imposed on them by the Townsmen for Lodgings The Endowment was settled by the same  Hugh  when Bishop  Anno  for a Master Fellows  c  Which Number might be increased or diminished according to the Improvement or Diminution of their Revenues It seems to have taken its Name from the Church of St  Peter  in its Neighbourhood  CLAREHALL  Was founded in the Year by  Richard Badew  Chancellor of the University with the Assistance of the Lady  Elizabeth Clare  Countess of  Ulster  He had before built a House called  Universityhall  wherein the Scholars lived upon their own Expence for Years till it was accidentally destroyed  by Fire The Founder finding the Charge of Rebuilding would exceed his Abilities had the kind Assistance of the said Lady thro' whose Liberality it was not only rebuilt but endowed It has been lately newbuilt all of Freestone and is one of the neatest and most uniform Houses in the University and delightfully situated on the Banks of the River which forms for it a Kind of natural Canal  PEMBROKEHALL  Was founded in the Year by the Lady  Mary St Paul  Countess of  Pembroke  third Wife to  Audomare de Valentia  Earl of  Pembroke  who having been unhappily slain at a Tilting on his Weddingday she intirely sequestered herself from all worldly Delights and amongst other pious Acts built this College which has been much augmented since by the Benefactions of others  ST BENNET's or CORPUSCHRISTI COLLEGE  Was founded by the Society of Friers in  CorpusChristi  in the Year This arose out of Two Guilds or Fraternities one of  Corpus Christi  and the other of the  Blessed Virgin  which after a long Emulation being united into one Body by a joint Interest built this College which took its Name from the adjoining Church of  St Benedict  Their greatest modern Benefactor was Dr  Matthew Parker  once Master of the College and afterwards Archbishop of  Canterbury  who by his prudent Management recovered several Rights of the College and besides Two Fellowships and Five Scholarships gave a great Number of excellent MSS to their Library which were mostly collected out of the Remains of the old AbbeyLibraries Colleges and Cathedrals and chiefly relate to the History of  England    TRINITYHALL  Was founded about the Year by  William Bateman  Bishop of  Norwich  It was built upon a Place which once belonged to the Monks of  Ely  and was a House for Students before the Time of Bishop  Bateman  who by Exchange for the Advowsons of certain Rectories got it into his own Possession He was a great Master of Civil and Canon Law whereupon the Master two Fellows and three Scholars the Number appointed by him at the first Foundation were obliged to follow those two Studies It has been since much augmented by Benefactors and the Number of its Members is proportionably increased  GONEVIL AND CAIUS COLLEGE  Anno    Edmund Gonevil  founded a Hall called after his Name upon the Place where now are the Orchard and Tenniscourt of  Bennetcollege  But within Five Years after it was removed into the Place where it now stands by Bishop  Bateman  Founder of  Trinityhall Anno    John Caius  Doctor of Physic improved this Hall into a new College since chiefly called by his Name and it has of late Years received considerable Embellishments  c  KING'S COLLEGE  Was founded in the Year by King  Henry  VI It was at first but small being built by that Prince for a Rector and Scholars only Near it was a little Hostel for Grammarians built by  William Bingham  which was granted by the Founder to King  Henry  for the Inlargement of his College Whereupon he united these two and having inlarged them by adding the Church of  St John Zachary  founded a College for a Provost Fellows and Scholars three Chaplains  c  The Chapel belonging to this College is deservedly reckoned one of the finest Buildings of its Kind in the World It is Feet  long broad and high to the Battlements and has not one Pillar in it It has large Windows on each Side finely painted and the Carving and other Workmanship of the numerous Stalls surpasses any thing of the Kind It constitutes one Side of a large Square for the Royal Founder designed that the College should be a Quadrangle all of equal Beauty but the Civil Wars in which he was involved with the House of  York  prevented his accomplishing it and the Prosecution of his good Design was reserved to our own Time for what has been added within these few Years past is not only an Ornament to the College but to the whole University and it is to be hoped that the College will be enabled in Time to finish the noble Work This new Part runs from the Westend of the Chapel a little detached from it to the Southward and makes another Side of the Square and contains spacious Chambers and Apartments being Feet in Length and in Breadth built with great Regularity and modern Beauty  Febr  the Workmen digging for the Foundation of the new Buildings of this College found a great Number of Broad Pieces of Gold of the Coin of King  Henry  V exceeding fair As soon as it was known the Governors of the College got out of the Workmens Hands a considerable Number which they made Presents of to their particular Benefactors and divided among themselves and the Fellows of the College but it is supposed that the Workmen secreted many for this Coin was very scarce before but after this was much easier to be met with  QUEEN'S COLLEGE  Was founded by Queen  Margaret  of  Anjou  Wife of King  Henry  VI in the Year but the troublesome Times that followed would not give her leave to complete the Fabrick The first Master  of it  Andrew Ducket  procured great Sums of Money from welldisposed Persons towards finishing of this Work and so far prevailed with Queen  Elizabeth  Wife of King  Edward  IV that she perfected what her professed Enemy had begun The Reverend Mr  Ferdinando Smithes  Senior Fellow of  Queen's College  who died in  November  gave  l  to the same to be appropriated to the Use of three Batchelors of Art till the Time of their taking their Masters Degree  CATHARINEHALL  Was founded in the Year by  Robert Woodlark  third Provost of  King's College  and the Hall was built overagainst the  Carmelites  House for one Master and three Fellows and the Numbers have been since greatly increased as well as the Revenues A great Part of it is lately newbuilt and may be said to be a beautiful and regular Fabrick  JESUS COLLEGE  Was founded  Anno  by  John Alcocke  Bishop of  Ely  out of an old Nunnery dedicated to St  Radegund  given him by King  Henry  VII and Pope  Julius  II on account of the scandalous Incontinence of the Nuns in order to be by him converted to this Use And this Prelate established in it a Master Six Fellows and Six Scholars But their Numbers have been much increased by great Benefactions  CHRIST'S COLLEGE  Was founded by the Lady  Margaret  Countess of  Richmond  Mother to King  Henry  VII  Anno  upon the Place where  God's House  formerly stood She settled there a Master and Fellows  c  which Number in King  Edward  VI's Time being complained of as favouring of Superstition by alluding to our Saviour and his Disciples that Prince added a th Fellowship with some new Scholarships This College has been within these few Years past adorned with a very fine new Building  ST JOHN'S COLLEGE  Was founded about the Year by the same Lady upon the Place where  Anno    Nigel  or  Neal  second Bishop of  Ely  founded an Hospital for Canons Regular which by  Hugh de Balsham  was converted into a Priory dedicated to St  John  and by the Executors of the said Countess of  Richmond  into a College under the Name of the same Saint For she died before it was finished which retarded the Work for some Time but it was afterwards carried on by her said Executors And in the Beginning of the Reign of King  James  I was greatly inlarged with fair new Buildings This College pleasantly situated by the River is no less remarkable for its Number of Students and its beautiful Groves and Gardens than for its strict and regular Discipline It has a noble Library which has been of late Years greatly augmented by the Accession of the Library of Dr  Gunning  late Bishop of  Ely  who bequeathed the same to it  MAGDALEN COLLEGE  Was founded  Anno  by  Thomas Audley  Lord Chancellor of  England  and was afterwards inlarged and endowed by Sir  Christopher Wrey  Lord Chief Justice of  England  This College stands by itself on the Northwest Side of the River and hath been of late Years improved and adorned by a handsome Piece of Building A Fellowship of a considerable Value has been lately founded at this College which is appropriated to Gentlemen of the County of  Norfolk  and called  The Travelling  Norfolk  Fellowship    To the Library of this College was left a valuable Collection of Pamphlets by  Pepys    Esq  as also great Numbers of Papers relating to the Navy and Admiralty The Benefactor bequeathed the Presses as well as the Books and Papers and they are kept in the manner he left them  TRINITY COLLEGE  Was founded  Anno  by King  Henry  VIII out of three others  St Michael  's College built by  Hervie  of  Stanton  in the Time of  Edward  II  King'shall  founded by  Edward  III and  Fishwick's Hostel  Its worthy Master  T Nevil  Dean of  Canterbury  repaired or rather newbuilt this College with that Splendor and Magnificence that for Spaciousness and the Beauty and Uniformity of its Buildings it is hardly to be outdone All which has been since still further improved by a most noble and stately Library begun by the late famous Dr  Isaac Barrow  A Building for the Bigness and Design of it says a Right Reverend Prelate perhaps not to be matched in these Kingdoms Nor is the Learning of the present Master easily to be parallel'd any more than the Troubles given to the College by the Contention between him on the one Side and the College and Bishops of  Ely  its Visitors on the other which take them all together in their Causes Progress and invalid Decision against him as it hitherto proves is one of the most extraordinary Affairs that ever happened in the University  EMANUEL COLLEGE  Was founded  Anno  by Sir  Walter Mildmay  Chancellor of the Exchequer to Queen  Elizabeth  in a Place where was formerly a Convent of  Dominicans  founded in the Year by the Lady  Alice  Countess of  Oxford  After the Suppression of Monasteries it came into the Possession of Mr  Sherwood  of whom Sir  Walter  seems to have bought it It has a very near Chapel built not many Years ago by the Bounty of Dr  William Sancroft  Archbishop of  Canterbury  and others And the Library belonging to it has received of late Years a fine Addition by the valuable Collection of Books of the same Archbishop given to it on the Decease of that Prelate  SIDNEYSUSSEX COLLEGE  Was founded by virtue of the Will of the Lady  Frances Sidney  Countess of  Sussex  who died  Anno  and by her Will left  l  for the founding of a College to be called  SidneySussex  It was erected on the Place where formerly the Monastery of  Grey Friers  built by King  Edward  I had flourished But tho' this College owes its Rise to the Bequest of this Lady and the Care of her Executors it is exceedingly improved by the Benefactions of Sir  Francis Clerk  who besides erecting a Set of new Buildings augmented the Scholarships and founded four Fellowships with eight Scholarships more and moreover Sir  John Brereton  left to it above  l  These are the Sixteen Colleges or  Halls  in this University  The  New Senatehouse  is a fine Edifice and with the Schools the UniversityLibrary and some other Buildings intended to be erected opposite to it will form a stately Quadrangle It is in Length Feet and in Breadth and is adorned with fluted Pillars a triangular Pediment and other beautiful Decorations  The Schools of this University were at first in private Houses hired from Ten Years to Ten Years for that Purpose by the University in which Time they might not be put to any other Use Afterwards Publick Schools were built at the Charge of the University in or near the Place where they now stand but the present Fabrick as it is now built of Brick and rough Stone was erected partly at the Expence of the University and partly by the Contributions of several Benefactors  The  University Library  was first built by  Rotheram  Archbishop of  York  who with  Tonstal  Bishop of  Durham  furnished it with choice Books few whereof are to be found at present But it contained  nevertheless about Books when his late Majesty King  George  I was graciously pleased in the Beginning of his Reign to purchase the large and curious Library of Dr  John Moor  Bishop of  Ely  who died  July  and as a Mark of his Royal Favour to bestow it upon this University  There have been very lately great Additions and Alterations made in the Library for the better Disposition of this valuable Royal Present which consisted of upwards of Volumes and cost the King Guineas And we cannot but observe in this Place That the late Lord Viscount  Townsbend  having understood that the University to shew their Gratitude and do Honour to the Memory of his late Majesty King  George  I intended to erect a Statue of that Prince in the said Library was pleased to offer to cause the same to be carved and set up at his own Expence which generous Tender was received by the University in the Manner it deserved and with Circumstances equally to their own and his Lordship's Honour And in the Month of  October  in pursuance thereof a fine Marble Statue of this great Prince was accordingly erected in the Senatehall of  King's College  on which are the following Inscriptions  viz  On the Front  GEORGIO  Optimo Principi  Magnae Britanniae Regi  Ob insignia ejus in banc Academiam  Merita  Senatus Cantabrigiensis  In perpetuum  Grati Animo Testimonium  Statuam  Mortuo ponendam  Decrovit  That is    The Senate of  Cambridge  has decreed That this Statue should be erected to his late most excellent Majesty  George  I King of  Great Britain  as a perpetual Monument of their Gratitude for his signal Benefits to this University  On the Left  CAROLUS  Vicecomes Townshend  Summum tum Academiae tum  Reipublicae Decus  Pro Eximia qua Regem Coluerat  Pietate Preque singulari  Qua Academiam feverat  Caritate Statuam  A Senatu Academito Decretam  Sumptibus suis e Marmore  Faciendam Locavit  That is    Charles  Lord Viscount  Townshend  a principal Ornament both of the University and the State agreeably to his singular Loyalty towards his Prince and the particular Affection wherewith he had cherished the University engaged to have the Statue which was decreed by the Senate of  Cambridge  made of Marble at his own Expence  CAROLUS  Filius  Vicecomes Townshend  Virtutum aeque ac Honorum  Paternorum Haeres  Statuam  Quam Pater Morte subita abreptus  Imperfectam reliquerat  Perficiendam  Atque in hoc ornatissimo  Academiae Loco collocandam  Curavit  That is    Charles  the Son Lord Viscount  Townshend  Heir alike to the Virtues and Dignities of his Father has caused the Statue which his Father seized by sudden Death had left imperfect to be finished and erected in this most honourable Place of the University  This great King was not contented with having given this noble Instance of his Royal Bounty to the University of  Cambridge  but in the Year was graciously pleased to confer another Mark of his Favour upon them and which extended not only to that but to the University of  Oxford  in creating a new Establishment in a most useful Branch of Learning which was much wanted and for which till then there had been no Provision which was to appoint two Persons not under the Degree of Master of Arts or Batchelor of Laws skilled in Modern History and in the Knowledge of Modern Languages to be nominated King's Professors of Modern History one for the University of  Cambridge  and the other for that of  Oxford  who are obliged to read Lectures in the Publick Schools at particular Times each of which Professors to have a  Stipend of  l per Annum  out of which each Professor is obliged to maintain with sufficient Salaries Two Persons at least well qualified to teach and instruct in writing and speaking the said Languages  gratis  Twenty Scholars of each University to be nominated by the King each of which is obliged to learn Two at least of the said Languages  The same excellent Prince also was pleased to appoint Twelve Persons chosen out of each of the Universities to be Preachers in the Royal Chapel of  Whitehall  at stated Times with handsome Salaries and declared that he would cause a particular Regard to be had to the Members of the Two Universities in the Dispositions of those Benefices which fell in the Royal Gift  Some other Benefactions to this University within these few Years past are as follow  Dr  John Woodward  who died  April  left to the University of  Cambridge  a Sum of Money for erecting a Professorship for  Natural Philosophy  with a Provision of  l per Annum  for the Support and Maintenance of the same for ever He likewise bequeathed to the said University his Collection of Fossils and other natural Curiosities and such a Part of his Library moreover as was necessary to illustrate his said Collection  On the Death of Mrs  Addenbroke Mar  Widow of an eminent Physician of that Name the Sum of about  l  devolved to this University which by the Doctor's Will is to be applied to the Building and Furnishing a Physical Hospital in  Cambridge  in which poor diseased People are to be admitted for Cure  gratis  The Master and Fellows of  Catharinehall  are appointed Trustees of this Charity  I shall not here enter into the puerile Dispute which has so much engaged several learned Pens that might have been better employed whether this  University or that of  Oxford  is the most ancient Their Emulation ought to be more worthily founded and indeed they have so much to boast as to the great and shining Ornaments they have respectively produced to Church and State and the Figure they make in the Commonwealth of Learning that it is strange so trifling a Contention should have been so warmly maintained  Cambridgecastle  was built by  William the Conqueror  as one of those many which he erected in divers Parts to curb his newly conquered People It was strong and stately and had in it among other spacious Apartments a most magnificent Hall This being neglected the Stones and Timber of it were afterwards begged of  Henry  IV by the Master and Fellows of  King'shall  towards the Building of their Chapel Nothing is now standing but the Gatehouse which is the Prison and an artificial high Hill of a steep Ascent and level at Top  The Town of  Cambridge  is very large most of its Streets are narrow the Houses very illbuilt and the greatest Part of them much out of Repair so that were it not for the Colleges and other publick Edifices it would make a very mean Appearance  From  Cambridge  the Road lies Northwest on the Edge of the Fens to  Huntingdon  on which stands the little Markettown of  Caxton  remarkable for the Birthplace of  Caxton  the first Printer in  England  The  Roman  Way passes from  Arington  S E thro'  Holm  into this Town and so on to  Papworth  higher up on the same Road which three lastmentioned Places are Villages only On this Side 'tis all an agreeable Corn Country adorned with several Seats of Gentleman but the chief is  WimpleHall  formerly built at a vast Expence by the late Earl of  Radnor  It was afterwards bought by his Grace  John Holles Cavendish  late Duke of  Newcastle  in a Partition of whose vast  Estate it fell to  Edward  late Earl of  Oxford  and  Mortimer  in Right of his Lady the only Daughter of the said Duke who brought the Earl this Estate and many others sufficient to denominate her one of the richest Heiresses in  Great Britain  but his Lordship parted with it a little before his Death to the Right Hon the Lord Chancellor  Hardwick  who now possesses it It is situated in a very dirty Country and notwithstanding the Cost bestowed upon it from its first Owner to this Time the Gardens and Buildings are both in a very bad Taste  From  Cambridge  my Design obliging me and the direct Road in part concurring I came back thro' the West Side of the County of  Essex  to  SaffronWalden  passing by  Linton  a small Markettown of no Note saying that a  Roman  Military Way falls into the  Ikening  here  SaffronWalden  is a fair Town with a good Church where stands a Monument of the Lord  Audley  Chancellor to King  Henry  VIII who made him a Grant of certain Lands belonging to a dissolved Monastery near this Town which takes its Name from the great Quantities of Saffron which formerly grew in the Grounds and were cultivated hereabouts and answered exceeding well in the Manufacturing but how it came into Decay nobody could account to me though there may be still seen a great many Acres of Saffronground about this Town This Commodity was never known to grow in  England  till the Reign of  Edward  III This Town gives Title of Baron to the Earl of  Suffolk  whose eldest Son is by Courtesy called Lord  Walden    Near this Town on the Side of  Cambridge  Road stands the noble and stately Palace of  AudleyInn  on  Audleyend  formerly the largest Palace of any in  England  and tho' a great Part of it has been pulled down is still one of the most magnificent Structures  in the whole Kingdom It was built out of the Ruins of the abovementioned Monastery by  Thomas  second Son of  Thomas  Duke of  Norfolk  who married the only Daughter and Heir of the aforenamed Lord  Audley  This  Thomas  was summoned into Parliament in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time as Lord  Audley  of  Walden  and was afterwards created Earl of  Suffolk  by King  James  I to whom he was first Chamberlain and afterwards Lord HighTreasurer It was designed for a Royal Palace for that King and when it was finished with all the Elegance and Politeness of Taste of the Times the King was invited to see it and as he passed to  Newmarket  he took up a Night's Lodging there And after having viewed it with great Surprise and Astonishment the Earl asked him How he approved of it Who answer'd Very well But troth Man said he 'tis  too much  for a  King  but it may  do  for a  Lord HighTreasurer  and so left it upon the Earl's Hands who is reported to have had then an Estate of  l  a Year which has been gradually decaying ever since and is now reduced to about  l  a Year with Incumbrances upon it King  Charles  II purchased this House and so it became what it was originally designed for a Royal Palace The King mortgaged the Hearthtax to the Earl to answer the Purchasemoney and appointed  James  then Earl of  Suffolk  Housekeeper thereof with a Salary of  l  a Year which Office continued in the Family till the Revolution when the Hearthtax was abolished And the Exigence of the State being such as it could not afford to pay the Purchasemoney King  William  III regranted the said House to the Family upon which  Henry  Earl of  Suffolk  who in his Father's Lifetime was created Earl of  Bindon  to qualify him to hold the Marshal's Staff pull'd down a great Part of this noble Edifice and reduced it considerably And yet it is still very large and  makes a grand Appearance You enter in at a large wide Pair of Iron Gates into a most spacious Courtyard on each Side of which was formerly a Row of Cloysters in which stood the Outoffices belonging to the House which have been all pulled down and supplied with a Stone Wall You pass in at the Forefront thro' Part of the House into a large open Quadrangle inclosed by four different Parts of the House and almost surrounded with Cloysters The Apartments above and below are very lofty and spacious and there is a very long wide Gallery which extends the whole Length of the Backfront of the House The Gardens are very indifferent but very capable of Improvement Behind the House is a fine Park extending to  SaffronWalden  well stored with Deer but not overburdened with Timber in which there is a rising Spot of Ground whereon if the House had been erected it would have had a much better Effect as to Prospect for its present Situation is low neither are the Grounds about it very fertile or I think healthy  But however great and magnificent this noble House appears it bears an indelible Stain if what is said be true That it was built with  Spanish  Gold upon the Ruin of the Great and Learned  Ralegh  who fell by the Revenge of  Spain  the Arts of  Gundamor  the Avarice of  Suffolk  and the unpardonable Weakness of his own King But the present Earl's Mind is more nobly endowed than that of his great Ancestor as being a generous and truly charitable Nobleman which he has testified by many beneficent Acts among his poor Neighbours especially during the great Frost in the Winter of  At a little Town called  Littlebury  not far from  AudleyInn  is a House which was erected by the famous Mr  Winstanley  who built  Eddystone  Lighthouse and perished in it as I shall mention in its Place Here he had made many odd Contrivances  of Chairs running on Springs  c  which usually much surprised Strangers who came to see the House The Person appointed to shew it generally placed the greatest Stranger into a particular Chair which on touching the Spring ran backward thro' the House into the Garden The same Gentleman was famous also for his Waterworks full of whimsical but ingenious Contrivances  But I ought not to omit that near  Icleton  and  Strethal  upon the River  Cam  lies  Chesterford  where in the Year were discovered the  Vestigia  of a  Roman  City The Foundation of the Walls is very apparent quite round tho' level with the Ground including about Acres Great Part of it serves for a Causeway to the publick  Cambridge  Road from  London  The  Crown Inn  is built upon it In the Northwest End of the Town is the Foundation of a  Roman  Temple Many  Roman  Coins have been found in the  Boroughfield  as they term the antient City whose Name was  Camboritum  according to Dr  Stukely  In this Parish they say has been a Royal Manor Not far off by  AudleyInn  is a great  Roman  Camp upon an Eminence where now stands an Huntingtower of Brick  A little North of this Part of the Country rises the River  Stour  which for a Course of fifty Miles or more parts the two Counties of  Suffolk  and  Essex  passing thro' or near  Haveril Clare Cavendish Halsted Sudbury Buers Nayland Stretford Dedham Manningtree  and into the Sea at  Harwich    As we came on this Side we saw at a Distance  Braintree  and  Bocking  two large and populous Towns which join together being parted by a little Stream of Water These were formerly very rich and flourishing occasioned by the great Trade for Bays which were manufactured in such Quantities in these two Towns as to send weekly to  London  Four Five or Six Waggons laden with them but this Trade having greatly decreased in a few Years the Inhabitants are in a very miserable Condition at present for by an Increase of their Poor their Parish Rates are risen so high as in the Year the Poors Rate in  Bocking  Parish was Nine Shillings in the Pound which together with their other Rates and Taxes rendered it very burdensome to all the Inhabitants and at the same time the Small Pox having infested both the Towns their Markets were almost deserted by the Country People The Parish of  Bocking  is a Deanery and the living is valued at upwards of  l per Annum    Near  Braintree  is the Parish of  Black Notely  in which are a few scattered Houses scarcely worth noticing except for the Memory of the late learned Mr  Ray  who resided many Years in this Place and was buried in the Churchyard over whose Grave a Monument was erected with an Inscription in  Latin  which being long we shall refer the Learned to the Original and content ourselves with giving the  English  for the sake of our common Readers and in regard to so great a Man who was an Honour to his Country It may be thus rendered  "The mortal Part of the most learned  John Ray  A M is deposited in this narrow Tomb but his Writings are not confined to one Nation and his Fame everywhere most illustrious renders them immortal Formerly he was Fellow of  TrinityCollege  in  Cambridge  and of the Royal Society in  London  a singular Ornament of both In every kind of Science as well divine as human most expert And like a second  Solomon  to whom alone perhaps he was inferior from the Cedar to the Hyssop from the largest of Animals to the smallest Insects he arrived at a consummate Knowledge And not only did he most accurately discourse of Plants spread over the  Face of the whole Earth but making a most strict Search even into its inmost Bowels whatever deserved Discussion throughout all Nature he describ'd While on his Travels abroad he diligently discovered what had escaped the Observation of others and first brought to Light many things most worthy of Remark Further than this he was endowed with so unaffected a manner of Behaviour that he was learned without Pedantry of a sublime Genius and at the same time which is rarely known of an humble and modest Disposition Not distinguished by an illustrious Extraction but what is greater by his own Virtue Little solicitous about obtaining Wealth and Titles he chose rather to deserve than to possess them Content with his own Lot he grew old in a private Station worthy a more ample Fortune In every other respect he readily observed Moderation in Study none  "To conclude To all these Perfections he added a Piety free from Artifice bearing an intire and hearty Veneration for the Church of  England  which he confirmed with his last Breath Thus happily in a virtuous Retirement lived he whom the present Age reveres and Posterity will admire"  NB  This Monument beginning to want Repair by standing exposed in the Churchyard hath been lately removed and set up in the Chancel of  Black Notely  Church To the former Epitaph is added on the Table on the Eastside a  Latin  Inscription which may be thus rendered  "This Cenotaph formerly exposed to the open Air in the Churchyard defaced by the Injuries of the Weather and just falling into Ruins was by  J Legge  M D repaired and removed under Shelter  March  "  The Country hereabout is very pleasant having many Risings and Falls with great Plenty of Water The Fields are well cultivated so as to render the whole Face of the Country like a Garden But what is often very surprising to Strangers is the Nakedness of most of the large Trees growing in their Hedge Rows and on the Sides of the Road even in the Month of  May  at which time few of them have put out any Leaves but upon Inquiry I found they were a peculiar Sort of Elm which rarely puts out Leaves before the Middle of  May  and this is one of the most common Trees of this Country  Near  Braintree  is  Felsted  a small Place but noted for a flourishing FreeSchool of an antient Foundation  Near to this is the Priory of  Lees  which I mentioned before  P  and hence keeping the  London  Road I came to  Chelmsford  mentioned also before and  Ingatestone  five Miles West which I mention again as I promised  Pag  to have an Opportunity to speak of the noble Family of Lord  Petre  and of the Improvements making at his Seat near this Place by the present Lord who is a Nobleman of fine Taste and great Qualities  Ingatestonehall  one of his Lordship's Seats lies at a small Distance from the publick Road on the Righthand about a Quarter of a Mile short of  Ingatestone  Town  The House is situated very low so as not to be seen at a small Distance It is a very large irregular Building and the Gardens are old tho' there were many Alterations made in them for the better by the present Lord before he came of Age but as this was not the Seat where he intended to reside so his Lordship did not employ his fine Genius in modelling of these Gardens but his whole Thoughts were bent to embellish his noble Seat at  Thorndon  which  is situated on a rising Ground about three Miles on the Righthand of  Brentwood  in  Essex  where his Lordship has been some Years laying of a Plan for a House and Gardens which when executed will be an Honour to the Nation  The House when finished will be Feet in Front exclusive of the Offices The principal Front is to the Southeast Aspect where is designed a spacious Court Before this is designed a Terracewalk near Feet broad and of a great Length on the other Side of this will be a Lawn of Grass containing near Acres of Land which is bounded by Plantations of Trees and handsome Farms  On the Backfront of the House is a noble Range of Stoves for tender Exotick Plants which when finished will far exceed whatever has been done of this Nature even by the greatest Princes in  Europe    The Park which lies on the Northeast and Northwest Side of the House is very large and well stocked with Timber which fully grown adds greatly to the Beauty of the Place In many Parts of this Park are large Inclosures which have been made by the present Lord and are converted to Nurseries which are completely stored with all Trees and Shrubs that will live in the open Air in this Climate so that when these Trees are planted out according to his Lordship's Design it will be the most beautiful and complete Plantation perhaps in  Europe    Thro' the Park there is already an Avenue cut leading from  Brentwood  to the House three Miles in Length on each Side of it are designed Plantations of Trees in regular Clumps which when finished will have a noble Effect as People pass thro' up to the House  The Kitchengarden is already finished and laid out with equal Elegance and Usefulness This is situated behind the Offices so that it does not appear in Sight from the House and is detached from the other Gardens and thereby is not exposed to Strangers who may have Admittance to walk thro' the Pleasuregarden and Plantations  In short the whole Plan is the most extensive and grand of any yet executed in this Kingdom  In the Parishchurch of  Ingatestone  are to be seen the Monuments of his Lordship's Ancestors who by a constant Series of beneficent Actions to the Poor and Bounty upon all charitable Occasions gained to themselves an affectionate Esteem thro' all that Part of the Country such as no Prejudice arising from a Difference in Religion could or ought to impair for great and good Actions command our Respect whatever the Opinions of the Donors may be  From hence we crossed the Country to the great Forest called  Epping Forest  reaching almost to  London  The Country on that Side of  Essex  is called the  Roodings  I suppose because there are no less than ten Towns almost together called by the Name of  Roding  and is famous for good Land good Malt and dirty Roads the latter being in the Winter hardly passable for Horse or Man In the Midst of this we see  Chipping Onger Hatfield BroadOak Epping  and many Foresttowns famed also for Husbandry and good Malt On the Southside of the County is  Walthamabbey  which was formerly a Monastery built by  Harold  Son to Earl  Godwin  in Honour of the Cross The Town is said to be built and peopled by one  Tovius  towards the Latterend of the  Saxons  Reign This Town is seated on the River  Lee  where the Streams being divided inclose several small Islands which in times of great Floods are commonly overflowed but these Meadows  produce great Plenty of Grass in Summer so that here are many Dairy Farms which turn to good Account  The Abbey is turned into a Seat which is now in the Possession of  Jones    Esq  The Gardens belonging to this House were some Years since in great Repute but since the Taste for inclosed Gardens has been condemned they have been little frequented unless by some curious Persons to see the  Tuliptree  which grows on a Grassplat near the House and is one of the finest and most flourishing of the Kind in  England  producing annually a great Quantity of Flowers in the Month of  July    At this Abbey was bury'd the Body of King  Harold  slain in the great Battle in  Sussex  against  William the Conqueror  whose Mother begged that Favour of  the Conqueror  but no Monument was built for him only a flat Gravestone on which was significantly engraven  Harold Infelix  From hence I came again over the Lower or Western Part of the Forest where it is bespangled with Villages filled with fine Seats most of them built by Citizens of  London  but the Lustre of them seems to be intirely eclipsed by the magnificent Palace of Earl  Tilney  which I barely mentioned  Pag  and intimated that I would touch upon it again as I shall now briefly do This noble Seat was prepared by his Lordship's Father Sir  Josiah Child  in his Lifetime who added to the Advantage of its Situation a vast Number of Rows of Trees planted in curious Order for Avenues and Vista's all leading up to the Spot of Ground where the old House stood  In the Place adjoining the present Lord before he was ennobled and some Years before he began the Foundation of his new House laid out the most spacious Pieces of fine Ground in Gardens that are to be seen in this Part of  England  The Greenhouse  is an excellent Building fit to entertain a Prince 'tis furnished with Stoves and artificial Places for Heat from an Apartment which has a Bagnio and other Conveniencies which render it both useful and pleasant and these Gardens have been so much the Admiration of the Publick that it has been the general Diversion of the Citizens to go out to see them till the Crouds grew so great that his Lordship was obliged to restrain the shewing them to particular and stated Times  The House was built since these Gardens were finished It is all of  Portland  Stone in the Front which gives it a most magnificent Effect at a Distance as the Nature of that Stone except in  London  where it is tinged with Smoke is to grow whiter and whiter the longer it stands in the open Air  As the Forefront of the House looks through a long Row of Trees reaching to the great Road at  Leightonstone  so the Backfront respects the Gardens from which you fall down an easy Descent which lands you upon the Terrace and gives a most beautiful Prospect to the River which is all formed into Canals and Openings to answer the Views from above and beyond the River the Walks and Wildernesses go on to such a Distance and in such a Manner up the Hill as they before went down that the Sight is lost in the Woods adjoining and it looks all like one continued planted Garden as far as the Eye can see  I have not Room in this Letter to say half what might be said of this truly noble Palace nor for a particular Description of the beautiful House and Gardens erected at  LowLayton  by the late Sir  Fisher Tench  which the Duke  d'Aumont  Embassador from  France  about the Year said was one of the neatest Boxes he had seen in  England  and so shall hasten to conclude this Letter  From Earl  Tilney  's House and the rest of the fine Dwellings on that Side of the Forest for there are several very good Houses at  Wanstead  only that they seem as I have said all lost in the Lustre of his Lordship's Palace I went South towards the great Road over that Part of the Forest called the  Flats  And by this Turn came necessarily on to  Stratford  where I set out And here I shall conclude my second Letter with assuring you that I am  Your most Humble Servant  LETTER III CONTAINING A  DESCRIPTION  of the County of  KENT  c  SIR  _I SHALL begin my Account of the famous County of  Kent  at  Deptford  It was antiently called  WestGreenwich  and is a very large Town and of late so very much improved that a handsome new Church has been built there dedicated to St  Paul    Here was built by King  Henry  VIII a Storehouse who also incorporated certain Officers by the Name of Master and Wardens of the  Holy Trinity  These were to take care of the Building Keeping and Conducting of the Royal Navy Their Hall or House was adjoining to the Church and the Treasurer of the Navy had also a convenient House at the Dock for his Residence  Here is a Foundation belonging to the said Corporation of  Trinityhouse  by whom it was built at different Times and in two Places not quite contiguous The old Part contains Houses the new for decayed Pilots or Masters of Ships  or the Widows of such the Men are allowed  s  the Women  s per  Month  But what  Deptford  is most noted for is its noble Dock where the Royal Navy was used to be built and repaired till it was found more convenient to build the larger Ships at  Woolwich  as I shall mention in its Place notwithstanding which the whole Area of the Yard is now inlarged to more than double what it formerly was it has a wet Dock of Two Acres for Ships and another of an Acre and half for Masts besides an Inlargement of its Storehouses Dwellinghouses Launches  c  suitable to it  Near the Dock is a Seat belonging to Sir  John Evelyn  which is called  Say'scourt  This was originally in the Family of the  Magmenots  who were  Normans  one of whom was Lord Warden of the Ports and Governor of  Dovercastle    The  Red House  at  Deptford  was a noted Collection of Warehouses and Storehouses for many Sorts of Merchandizes and particularly Hemp Flax Pitch Tar  c  But on  Thursday  the th of  July  a dreadful Fire broke out there which consumed the same The Loss was incredible for the Materials were so combustible that nothing could be saved nor could the Flames be extinguished till they had nothing to prey upon  From  Deptford  I proceeded to  Greenwich  one of the most delightful Spots of  Great Britain  The Park in which is the fine Observatory called  Flamsteadhouse  from the late famous Mathematician of that Name the Royal House but more especially the noble Hospital deserve particular Notice  The Ground on which Part of this Hospital now stands is the same on which was formerly situated the Royal Palace of our Kings Here  Henry  VIII held his Feasts with Jousts and Tournaments and the Ground which was called the  Tiltyard  is  the Spot on which the East Wing of the Hospital is built  The Park was inlarged walled about and planted by King  Charles  II soon after the Restoration and the Design or Plan of a Royal Palace was then laid out one Wing of which was finished in a magnificent Manner and makes now the First Wing of the Hospital towards  London    The Royal Palace now remaining was originally built by  Humphrey  Duke of  Gloucester  surnamed  the Good  Brother of  Henry  VI and called by him  Placentia  King  Henry  VII much inlarged it added to it a small House of  FriersMendicant  and finished a Tower begun by Duke  Humphrey  on the Top of the Hill where now stands the Royal Observatory from which is a most pleasant Prospect down to the winding River and the green Meadows It was completed by King  Henry  VIII and afterwards much inlarged and beautified by  Henry Howard  Earl of  Northampton  who dwelt in it Here Queen  Mary  and Queen  Elizabeth  were born and here died King  Edward  VI  The Hospital was founded by King  William  and Queen  Mary  in the Year for the Relief of Seamen their Widows and Children and Encouragement of Navigation Three Tables are hung up at the Entrance into the Hall which record the Names of several generous Benefactors to this noble Charity amounting in the Whole to the Sum of  l  And in the Year the forfeited Estate of the late Earl of  Derwentwater  being by means of the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount  Gage  a Peer of  Ireland  recovered out of the Hands of certain private Persons who had purchased the same at a Rate vastly disproportioned to the Value amounting to near  l per Annum  was given by Parliament to carry on and complete this Work which will enable them to prosecute it with Vigour and Success  and accordingly they have made a great Progress since that time in the second Wing and other Parts of this sumptuous Edifice  The Hall is very noble and finely painted by the late Sir  James Thornhill  At the Upperend of it in an Alcove are represented the present Royal Family the late Princess  Sophia  King  George  I King  George  II and Queen  Caroline  the Queen Dowager of  Prussia  the Prince of  Wales  the Duke and the five Princesses On the Ceiling over the Alcove are her late Majesty Queen  Anne  and Prince  George  of  Denmark  And on the Ceiling of the Hall are King  William  and Queen  Mary  with several fine emblematical Figures  On a Pedestal in the Middle of the Area of the Hospital fronting the  Thames  is a Statue of his Majesty King  George  II  Anno  disabled Seamen were the first that were received into this Hospital but the present Number was made up in  December  a complete To each Pensioners Six Nurses are allowed who are to be Seamens Widows at  l per Annum  and  s per  Week more to those who attend in the Infirmary Their common Cloathing is Blue with Brass Buttons  The Church of  Greenwich  is a very handsome newbuilt Edifice dedicated to St  Alphage  Archbishop of  Canterbury  who is said to have been killed by the  Danes  on the Spot where the Church stands  Anno    There are two FreeSchools in this Parish one founded by Sir  William Boreman  Kt The other was set up by Mr  John Roan  who left his Estate for Teaching Boys in Reading Writing and Arithmetick allowing  l per Annum  for each Boy's Cloaths their Number is Twenty  There is also a handsome College in this Town which fronts the River for the Maintenance of  Twenty poor Men and a Master founded and well endowed by  Henry  Earl of  Northampton  and committed by him to the Care of the Mercers Company of  London  A Chapel belongs to this College where the Earl's Body is laid which as well as his Monument was removed hither a few Years ago from the Chapel of  Dover  Castle whereof he was Constable  This Town may be said to be one of the genteelest as well as pleasantest in  England  the Inhabitants are many of them Persons of Note and Fashion who have served abroad in the Fleets or Armies and here pass the Remainder of their Days in Ease and Delight having the Pleasure to reflect upon the Dangers they have gone thro' and the faithful and honourable Parts they have acted on the publick Stage of Life in their Country's Cause  A Market was erected in the Year at this Town the Direction of which is in the Governors of the Hospital and the Profits which shall arise from it are to be carried to the Use of that fine Foundation  The River of  Thames  is here very broad and the Chanel deep and the Water at some very high Springtides is salt but in ordinary Tides sweet and fresh  The Country behind  Greenwich  adds to the Pleasure of the Place  Blackheath  both for Beauty of Situation and an excellent Air is not outdone by any Spot of Ground in  England    Near this is a vast Hill used as a Butt for Archers and in great Request among the neighbouring People till King  Henry  VIII's Time whence it took the Name of  Shootershill    On the Eastside of  Blackheath  stands the Hospital built by Sir  John Morden  Bart a  Turkey  Merchant Several Years before his Death which happened in he erected this spacious Structure in form of a  College solely at his own Charge in a Field called  Great Stone Field  not far from his own Habitation for the Reception of poor decayed honest Merchants whereof in his Lifetime he placed Twelve there But by reason of great Losses they were reduced to Four in the Lady  Morden  's Time who was forced to retrench the Expences of the House because the Share allotted her by the last Will of Sir  John  and some Parts of his Estate did not answer so well as was expected  When she died Sir  John  's whole Estate coming to the College the Number was again increased and there are at this Time poor Gentlemen in the House and the Number not being limited they are to be increased as the Estate will afford for the Building was designed for and will conveniently hold  Seven  Turkey  Merchants have the Direction and Visitation of this Hospital and the Nomination of the Persons to be admitted into it and as often as any of these Seven die the Survivors are to chuse others to fill up that Number  Every Treasurer of this Hospital has  l per Annum  There is also a Chaplain who is to read Prayers twice a Day in the Chapel and to preach twice every  Sunday  His Salary at first was  l  a Year but the Lady  Morden  doubled it at her Death She was in other respects a Benefactress to the College and as she put up her Husband's Statue in a Niche over the Gate of the College the Trustees have also put up hers in another Niche adjoining to that of her Husband  The Pension is  l per Annum  each At first they wore Gowns with the Founder's Badge which they have not done for some Years  The Chapel within the College is neatly wainscotted and hath a costly Altarpiece and it has a Buryingplace adjoining for the Members of the  College The Founder according to his own Desire was buried in a Vault under the Communiontable of this Chapel  The Chaplain the Treasurer the Merchants are all indispensably obliged to be resident there and unless in case of Sickness no other Persons are to reside live or lodge there and no Person is to be admitted as a Pensioner who cannot bring a Certificate to prove himself upwards of Years of Age  In a Word as the Situation of the Place is pleasant the Air very good and the Endowment very sufficient this may be said to be one of the most comfortable and elegant Pieces of Charity in  England    Near this College is the noble House or rather Palace of Sir  Gregory Page  Bart whose Father was a Brewer at  Greenwich  a few Years ago It is one of the finest Seats in  England  belonging to a private Gentleman and the Park Gardens and Country round it contribute to make it a most delightful and truly noble Habitation  It was begun and intirely raised and covered in the Space of Eleven Months which shews how soon a large Building may be finished where Money the Sinews of Building  c  is not wanting  Over this Heath the famous  Roman Watlingstreet  ran towards  Shootershill  and so on to  Rochester Canterbury  and  Dover  Here are great Numbers of small  Tumuli  with some large and eminent ones out of which Bones have been dug by the late learned Dr  Gale  who resided many Years on this Heath which shew that many Persons of Eminence have been formerly buried here  On this Heath the  Danish  Army lay a great while encamped  A D  and many Trenches and other Remains of the Lines of Camps are still visible  On the other Side of the Heath North is  Charlton  a wellbuilt pleasant Village The Church was  beautified and repaired by Order of Sir  Edward Newton  Bart who was Tutor to King  James  the First's Son Prince  Henry  and it is one of the finest Churches in this County  At the Entrance of this Village fronting  Blackheath  stands the antient House built by Sir  Edward Newton  who had this Manor granted to him by King  James  I It is a long Pile of Building in a  Gothick  Taste having Four Turrets on the Top the Court before the House is spacious at the Entrance of which are too large  Gothick  Piers to the Gates and in a Line on the Outside of the Wall is a long Row of  Cypress Trees  which are some of the oldest in  England  On the Back of the House are large Gardens remaining in the same Taste in which they were formerly laid out and behind these is a small Park which joins to  Woolwich Common  This House is now in the Possession of the Earl of  Egmont    Near the Church are two fine Houses one of which was built by the late Lord  Romney  who married a Daughter of Sir  Cloudesly Shovel  the other was in the Possession of the late Governor  Hunter  before he went to  Jamaica    These Houses stand on the Edge of the Hill having their Gardens sloping down towards the River which tho' it renders the Prospect to the River very delightful in the Heat of Summer yet as it exposes their Gardens to the North Winds their Fruittrees are generally blighted and in the Spring when the Wind usually blows from the North and East these Gardens are so much exposed to them that it is very few Days during that Season that Persons can walk with any Pleasure in them  It is true that in these Gardens you have a large Reach of the River in View so that every Tide of Flood a great Number of Ships are generally sailing by to  London  as in the Tide of Ebb many are  passing toward  Gravesend  which affords a very delightful Sight as it shews the great Trade carried on by the Metropolis yet as the Country on the other Side of the Water is a dead Flat for a great Number of Miles and this often covered with Water in Winter so the Winds not only come very cold over this Flat but also bring Fogs Damps and a very unwholsome Air with them which greatly diminishes the Pleasure of these Seats  Charlton  is noted for the Fair held in its Neighbourhood on St  Luke  's  day Octob  called  Hornfair  the Rudeness of which in a civilized wellgoverned Nation may well be said to be unsufferable The Mob at that Time take all Kinds of Liberties and the Women are especially impudent that Day as if it was a Day that justified the giving themselves a Loose to all manner of Indecency without any Reproach or without incurring the Censure which such Behaviour would deserve at another time  And this in a Circumstance which far from being to be gloried in ought to be discountenanced by the Sex as fixing the Brand of Incontinence on too many of them which they have little Reason to be proud of  A vulgar Tradition gives the following Origin to this disorderly Fair It pretends to say that one of the Kings of  England  some say King  John  who had a Palace in this Neighbourhood at  Eltham  being a hunting near  Charlton  then a pitiful Hamlet only and separated from his Attendants entered into a Cottage and found the Mistress of it alone and she being handsome the King took a Liking to her and having prevailed over her Modesty just in the critical Moment her Husband came in and vowing to kill them both the King was forced to discover himself and to compound with Gold for his Safety giving him moreover all the Land from  thence as far as the Place now called  Cuckold's Point  and making him Master of the whole Hamlet established a Fair in favour of his new Demesne and in Memory thereof Horns and Wares and Toys of all Sorts made of Horn are sold at this Fair  Thro' this Town lies the Road to  Woolwich  a Town situated on the Bank of the River and wholly taken up by and in a manner raised from the Yards and Works erected there for the Naval Service For here when the Business of the Royal Navy increased and Queen  Elizabeth  built larger and greater Ships of War than were usually employed before new Docks and Launches were erected and Places prepared for the Building and Repairing Ships of the largest Size because here was a greater Depth of Water and a freer Chanel than at  Deptford    The Docks Yards and all the Buildings belonging to it are encompassed with a high Wall and are exceeding spacious and convenient and so prodigiously full of all Sorts of Stores of Timber Plank Masts Pitch Tar and other Naval Provisions as can hardly be calculated  Besides the Buildingyards here is a large Ropewalk where the biggest Cables are made for the Men of War and on the East or Lowerpart of the Town is the Gunyard commonly called the  Park  or the  Gunpark  where is a prodigious Quantity of Cannon of all Sorts for the Ships of War every Ship's Guns apart heavy Cannon for Batteries and Mortars of all Sorts and Sizes insomuch that as I was inform'd here have been sometimes laid up at one Time between seven and eight Thousand Pieces of Ordnance besides Mortars and Shells almost beyond Number  Here also is the House where the Firemen and Engineers prepare their Fireworks charge Bombs Carcasses and Granadoes for the publick Service  Here is usually a Guardship riding especially in time of War The Town of late Years is much inlarged and beautified several fine Docks Ropeyards and capacious Magazines added and the Royal Foundery for Cannon repaired and improved The  Thames  is here at high Water near a Mile over and the Water salt upon the Flood and as the Chanel lies strait East and West for about three Miles the Tide runs very strong and the River is intirely free from Shoals and Sands and has seven or eight Fathom Water so that the biggest Ships may ride here with Safety even at low Water  The Parishchurch of  Woolwich  has been lately rebuilt as one of the Fifty new Churches in a very handsome manner  From this Town till we come to  Gravesend  the whole Shore is low and spread with Marshes and unhealthy Grounds except some few Intervals where the Land bends inward as at  Erith Greenhythe Northfleet  c in which Places the Chalk Hills almost join the River and from thence the City of  London  the adjacent Countries and even  Holland  and  Flanders  are supplied with Lime or with Chalk to make it  From these Cliffs on the Riverside the Rubbish of the Chalk which they must be otherwise at the Charge of removing is bought and fetched away by Lighters and Hoys and carried to all the Forts and Creeks in the opposite County of  Essex  and even to  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  and sold there to the Farmers to lay upon their Land which they do in prodigious Quantities and are glad to give from  s    d  to  s  a Load for it according to the Distance  This is the Practice in all the Creeks and Rivers in  Essex  even to  Malden Colchester  the  Nase  and into  Harwich  Harbour up to  Maningtree  and  Ipswich  as also in  Suffolk  to  Aldborough Orford Dunwich Swold  and as high as  Yarmouth  in  Norfolk    Thus the barren Soil of  Kent  for such the chalky Grounds are esteemed make the strong clayey Lands of  Essex  rich and fruitful and the Mixture of Earth forms a Composition which out of two barren Extremes makes one prolifick Medium  Behind these marshy Grounds in  Kent  at a small Distance lies the Road from  London  to  Dover  on which or near it are several good Towns for Example  Eltham  formerly a Royal Palace when the Court was kept at  Greenwich  and Queen  Elizabeth  who as before said was born at  Greenwich  was often carried to  Eltham  by her Nurses to draw in the wholsome Air of that agreeable Place but at present there are few or no Signs of the old Palace to be seen  It is now however a pleasant Town very handsomely built full of good Houses and many Families of rich Citizens inhabit there who bring a great deal of good Company with them  Near  Eltham  lies  Chesilhurst  where is the Buryingplace of the Family of the  Walsinghams  who resided in this Parish for several Generations  In this Parish is an antient Seat called  Frogpool  or  Fragnall  which in the Reign of King  Henry  III was in the Possession of  Thomas le Barbur  who in the th Year of the late King's Reign had a Charter of  FreeWarren  for his Lands here This Seat is now in the Possession of Mr  Tryon  a Merchant of  London    This Village is famous for the Retirement of the famous Mr  Camden  who resided here for several Years and here composed the greatest Part of his  Annals of Queen  Elizabeth  Near this are several other Towns and Villages as  Bexley Crayford Wilmington Footscray Northcray  c which being Places of little Note I shall pass over with only observing that about these Villages are many Woods chiefly of  Birch  from whence  the Broommakers in  Kentstreet Southwark  are supplied with their Birch which bring in a considerable Profit to the Landowners  From this Side of the Country all pleasant and gay we go over  Shooter'shill  where the Face of Things seems quite altered for here we have but a chalky Soil and far from rich much overgrown with Coppicewood which is cut for Faggots and Bavins and sent up by Water to  London  Here they make those Faggots which the Woodmongers call Ostreywood and in particular those small light Bavins which are used in Taverns in  London  to light their Faggots and are called in the Taverns a  Brush  and by the Woodmen  Pimps  'Tis incredible what vast Quantities of these used to be laid up at  Woolwich Erith  and  Dartford  but since the Taverns in  London  are come to make Coalfires in their upper Rooms that Trade declines and tho' that Article would seem to be trifling in itself 'tis not immaterial to observe what an Alteration it makes in the Value of those Woods in  Kent  and how many more of them than usual are yearly grubbed up and the Land made fit for the Plough  In  July  a very good Design was begun to be put in Execution on  Shootershill  a Number of Hands being employ'd in cutting a new Road wide enough for three Carriages to pass abreast on the Eastern Descent of the Hill which was formerly so narrow that it was impossible for a Passenger if waylaid to escape falling into a Ruffian's Hands and which gave Occasion to many Robberies being committed here  Dartford  is a handsome large Town having many good Houses in it and is finely watered by two or three very good Springs the River goes thro' the Town and discharges itself into the  Thames  On this River the first  Papermill  in  England  was built by Sir  John Spillman  in the Reign of King  Charles  I  who granted him a Patent with a Salary of  l per Annum  for his Encouragement  The first Mill also for Slitting of Bars of Iron for making of Wire was on this River  There are two Churchyards here one about the Church and the other on the Top of the Hill towards  Northfleet  in the latter of which you may look over the Tower of the Church the Ground rising suddenly so very high  Here is a very good Market for Corn on  Saturdays  and an annual Fair on the d of  July    January  the Powdermill at  Dartford  blew up with this remarkable Circumstance That tho' all the Servants were about their respective Employments not one of them received any Hurt And it is further remarkable that within eight Years this is the fourth Time that this Mill has been blown up and no Damage done by the Disaster to the Persons of the People belonging to it  Gravesend  lies on the Northside of  Kent  on the River  Thames  about six Miles Northeast from  Dartford  and about the same Distance from  Rochester  The Town of  Gravesend  and  Milton  were incorporated in the th Year of Queen  Elizabeth  by the Name of the  PortReeve  Jurats and Inhabitants of the Towns of  Gravesend  and  Milton  As this Place is the most frequented Passage of taking Boat for  London  by Persons who come from  Dover Rochester c  or thro' any Part of  Kent  from foreign Parts so Queen  Elizabeth  ordered the Mayor Aldermen and Companies of the City of  London  to receive all eminent Strangers and Embassadors here in their Formalities and so to attend them to  London  in their Barges if they came up by Water and if they came by Land they were ordered to meet them on  Blackheath  on Horseback in their Gowns So much did that wise Queen consult the Honour and Grandeur of the City  King  Henry  VIII raised here a Platform of Guns and another at  Milton  as well as two others overagainst them on the  Essex  Side for the Security of the River But since the Erection of  Tilburyfort  these have been demolished  In the Year this Town was burnt by the  French  and  Spanish  Galleys and the Enemies carried away most of the Inhabitants Prisoners  Here is a very handsome Charity given by one Mr  Henry Pinnock  in the Year of Dwellings and a House for a Master Weaver to employ the Poor And a good Estate is also settled for the Repairs  In this Town on the Eastside is still standing the Body of an antient Chapel which seems to have belonged to some Religious House for Places in the Walls of the Vault remain still for Holy Water A Market is kept here on  Wednesdays  and  Saturdays  and an annual Fair on the th of  October  which lasts a Week  There have been very great Improvements made of the Lands near this Town within a few Years past by turning them into Kitchengardens the Land being fresh for this Purpose as also pretty moist and the Town having good Quantity of Dung made in it with which they manure the Land it produces very good Gardenstuff in great Plenty wherewith they not only supply the Towns for several Miles round but also send great Quantities to the  London  Markets particularly  Asparagus  which is so much esteemed that the Name of  Gravesend  will bring a better Price than what is brought from any other Place this having obtained a much greater Reputation than  Battersea  which was some Years since famous for  Asparagus    As  Gravesend  is the great Ferry as they call it between  London  and  EastKent  It is hardly credible what Numbers of People pass here every Tide as  well by Night as by Day between this Town and  London  Almost all the People of  EastKent  when they go for  London  go no farther by Land than this Town and then for  d  in the Tiltboat or  s  in a small Boat or Wherry are carried to  London  by Water  Another Thing for which this Town is worth notice is that all the Ships which go to Sea from  London  take as we say their Departure from hence for here all outwardbound Ships must stop come to an Anchor and suffer what they call a second Clearing  viz  here a Searcher of the Customs comes on board looks over all the Coquets or Entries of the Cargo and may if he pleases romage the whole Lading to see if there are any more Goods than are entered which however they seldom do tho' they forget not to take a Compliment for their Civility and besides being well treated on board have generally Three or Five Guns fired in Honour to them when they go off  The Method of causing all Ships to stop here is worth observing and is as follows  When a Merchantship comes down from  London  if they have the Tide of Ebb under Foot or a fresh Gale of Wind from the West so that they have what they call Freshway and the Ships come down apace they generally hand some of their Sails haul up a Foresail or Mainsail or lower the Foretopsail so to slacken her Way as soon as they come to the  Old Man's Head  when they open the Reach which they call  Gravesend  Reach which begins about a Mile and half above the Town they do the like to signify that they intend to bring to as the Sailors call it and come to an Anchor  As soon as they come among the Ships that are in the Road as there are always a great many the Centinel at the Blockhouse on  Gravesend  Side fires his Musket which is to tell the Pilot he must  bring  to  if he comes on as soon as the Ship passes Broadside with the Blockhouse the Centinel fires again which is as much as to say  Why don't you bring to  If he drives a little farther he fires a third time and the Language of that is  Bring to immediately and let go your Anchor or we will make you    If the Ship continues to drive down and does not let go her Anchor the Gunner of the Fort is call'd and he fires a Piece of Cannon tho' without Ball and that is still a Threat tho' with some Patience and is to say  Will you come to an Anchor or will you not  If he still ventures to go on by which he gives them to understand he intends to run for it then the Gunner fires again and with a Shot and that Shot is a Signal to the Fortress over the River  viz Tilbury Fort  which I describ'd in my Account of  Essex p  and they immediately let fly at the Ship from the Guns on the East Bastion and after from all the Guns they can bring to bear upon her It is very seldom that a Ship will venture their Shot because they can reach her all the Way to the  Hope  and round the  HopePoint  almost to  HoleHaven  tho' 'tis said this has been done once or twice but the Occasion must be very extraordinary to make a Ship run the Risque As for Ships coming in they all go by here without any Notice taken of them unless it be to put Waiters on board if they are not supply'd before  On the th of  August  a dreadful Fire happen'd here which burnt down and destroyed the Church and the greatest Part of the Town and in an Act of Parliament passed for rebuilding the Church as one of the Fifty new ones and the Town too being mostly rebuilt makes a better Appearance for the Calamity it underwent  The Passage to and from  Gravesend  to  London  is now made more commodious and safe for Passengers than before by Act of Parliament passed in  for regulating the Company of Watermen  c  between  Gravesend  and  Windsor  which limits the Number of Passengers to Forty at the most on board the Tiltboats and Ten at most by the Wherries directs the Burden of the said Boats prohibits close Decks and Bails nailed down in the Wherries prescribes the Times of Departure of the Tiltboats and Wherries and the Age of the Watermen navigating the said Boats and directs a Punishment against such Watermen as wilfully lose their Tide or set the Passengers on Shore two Miles short of the Place to which they are bound And the Rulers of the Watermens Company are thereby obliged to provide Officers at  Billinsgate  and at  Gravesend  who as near as is possible Night and Day at every Time of HighWater and first of Flood are at the respective Places to ring publickly a Bell set up for that Purpose for Fifteen Minutes to give Notice to the Tiltboats and Wherries to put off and make the best of their Way without lying by or putting on Shore being within two Miles of their respective Ports Which excellent Provisions must be a great Ease and Safety to all Persons who are obliged to use this Passage  A remarkable Occurrence happening the last Time I was at  Gravesend  deserves to be mentioned here in Honour to a brave and excellent  English  Mariner The Case was thus  On  Saturday December  the Ship  Anne  and  Thomas  Captain  Ogilvie  Commander outwardbound for  Africa  lying at  Gravesend  was by the boiling over of a Kettle of Pitch set on Fire to extinguish which the Crew at first made an Attempt but finding the Flames increase upon them they were all upon the Point of leaving her for Fear of Barrels of Gunpowder which were on board when happily the Mate returning from a Visit he had been making to a Brother Officer of a neighbouring Ship  stopp'd their Design and with a noble Resolution cutting the Boats clear of the Ship told them they had no Means left to escape perishing either by Fire or Water but by heartily joining their Endeavours to extinguish the Flames When they found themselves in so bad a Dilemma they unanimously attempted it and after some time providentially got it under to the no small Joy of the Town of  Gravesend  as well as of all the Ships near them who were in the utmost Consternation for Fear of the Gunpowder and every Moment in Expectation of the terrible Blow  We see nothing remarkable on the Road hereabouts but  Gad  's  Hill  a noted Place for robbing of Seamen after they have received their Pay at  Chatham  Here it was that a famous Robbery was committed in or about the Year which deserves to be mentioned It was about Four o'Clock in the Morning when a Gentleman was robb'd by one  Nicks  on a Bay Mare just on the Declivity of the Hill on the West Side  Nicks  came away to  Gravesend  and as he said was stopp'd by the Difficulty of getting the Boat near an Hour which was a great Discouragement to him but he made the best Use of it as a kind of Bait to his Horse from thence he rode cross the County of  Essex  to  Chelmsford  here he stopp'd about half an Hour to refresh his Horse and gave him some Balls from thence to  Braintree Bocking Wethersfield  then over the Downs to  Cambridge  and from thence keeping still the cross Roads he went by  Fenny Stratford  to  Godmanchester  and  Huntingdon  where he baited himself and his Mare about an Hour and as he said himself slept about half an Hour then holding on the North Road and keeping a full Gallop most of the Way he came to  York  the same Afternoon put off his Boots and riding Cloaths and went dress'd as if he had been an Inhabitant of the Place to the Bowlinggreen where among other Gentlemen was the LordMayor of the City He singling out  his Lordship studied to do something particular that the Mayor might remember him by and then takes Occasion to ask his Lordship what o'Clock it was who pulling out his Watch told him the Hour which was a Quarter before or a Quarter after Eight at Night  Upon a Prosecution for this Robbery the whole Merit of the Case turn'd upon this single Point the Person robb'd swore to the Man to the Place and to the Time in which the Fact was committed but  Nicks  proving by the LordMayor that he was as far off as  Yorkshire  at that Time the Jury acquitted him on a bare Supposition that it was impossible the Man could be at two Places so remote on one and the same Day  On the Road from  Gad  's  Hill  to  Rochester  are very large CherryOrchards especially on the Righthand of the Road these Cherries are sent up to  London  in Hoys and were formerly a great Branch of Trade to the Landowners of this Country but of late Years there has been such Plenty of this Fruit that they have scarce paid for gathering and sending to  London  which has occasioned many of the Owners of these Orchards to destroy them  From  Gad  's  Hill  we come to  RochesterBridge  the longest highest and the strongest built of all the Bridges in  England  except that of  London  Some indeed say the Bridge of  Newcastle upon Tyne  exceeds all the Bridges in  England  for Strength but then it is neither so high nor so long as this at  Rochester  It is supported by eleven Arches and was built by Sir  Robert Knowles  in the Reign of  Henry  IV and railed in with Iron at the Charge of Archbishop  Warham    The River  Medway  at this Place is very broad and rapid foaming most violently  Rochester  was the  Roman  City  Durobrivis  and was very strong being wall'd about and ditch'd Many Antiquities have  been found hereabouts This City stands in an Angle of the River and seems to have been of a square Form the  Watlingstreet  running directly thro' it Most of the Walls still remain and a large Piece of the  Roman  Wall made of Rubblestone laid sloping sideways is to be seen near that Angle below the Bridge encompassed by the River with  Roman  Bricks in several Places  Rochester Stroud  and  Chatham  are three distinct Places but in a manner contiguous  Rochester  has suffer'd very much by Fire and War It consists chiefly of a large illbuilt broad Street  Stroud  is separated from it only by a Bridge and may alone pass for a small City and is wellbuilt but has nothing very remarkable in it  The Castle of  Rochester  was erected by King  William  I out of one Angle of the River The Walls of the great Tower now left are four Yards thick The Body of the Cathedral is of the original Structure before the Conquest and repair'd by Bishop  Gundulph  an Architect who likewise built the Castle The great Tower is call'd  Gundulph  's  Tower  The chalky Cliff under the Castle Wall next the River is a romantick Sight The Rapidity of the Stream wastes it away and then huge Tracts of the Wall fall down On the North Side of the Northwest Tower of the Church is  Gundulph  's Effigies The Front of the Church is of the old Work but a new Window put in the Middle The Eastern Gate of the City was pull'd down not very long ago the Stones of which were of a  Roman  Cut The Townhouse and Charityschool are two of the best publick Buildings in  Rochester  and  Stroud  except the Churches  But  Chatham  being the chief Arsenal of the Royal Navy of  Great Britain  is the most considerable of the Kind in the World The private Buildings as the Houses of the SeaOfficers Directors Inspectors  and Workmen belonging to the Royal Navy are wellbuilt and many of them stately But the publick Edifices there are indeed like the Ships themselves surprisingly large and in their several Kinds beautiful The Warehouses or rather Streets of Warehouses and Storehouses for laying up the Naval Treasure are the largest in Dimension and the most in Number that are anywhere to be seen in the World The Ropewalks for making Cables and the Forges for Anchors and other Ironwork bear a Proportion to the rest as also the Wetdock Canals and Ditches for keeping Masts and Yards of the greatest Size where they lie sunk in the Water to preserve them The Boatyard Ropeyards the Anchoryard Forges Founderies all not easy to be described  We come next to the Stores themselves for which all this Provision is made and first to begin with the Ships that are laid up there The Sails the Rigging the Ammunition Guns great and small Shot small Arms Swords Cutlasses Halfpikes with all the other Furniture belonging to the Ships that ride at their Moorings in the River  Medway  Powder excepted which is generally carried to particular Magazines to avoid Disaster all these Stores are reposited in separate Buildings and Storehouses appropriated for the Furniture of every Ship and may be taken out on the most emergent Occasion without Confusion  Besides these are Warehouses for laying up the Furniture and Stores for Ships in general and for the furnishing other Ships to be built or for repairing and supplying the Ships already there as Occasion may require  For this Purpose there are separate and respective Magazines of Pitch Tar Hemp Flax Tow Resin Oil Tallow also of Sailcloth Canvas Cables standing and running Rigging ready fitted and Cordage  not fitted with all Kinds of Shipchandlery Necessaries such as Blocks Tackles Runners  c  with the Cooks Boatswains and Gunners Stores and also Anchors of all Sizes Grapnells Chains Bolts and Spikes wrought and unwrought Iron CastIron Work such as Pots Caldrons Furnaces  c  also Boats spare Masts and Yards with a great Quantity of Lead and Nails and other Necessaries too many to be enumerated  To observe these Things deliberately one would almost wonder what Ships they were and where they should be found which could either for Building or Repairing Fitting or Refitting call for such a Quantity of all these Things but when on the other hand one sees the Ships and considers their Dimensions and consequently the Dimensions of all Things which belong to them how large how strong every thing must be how much of the Materials must go to the making every thing proportionable to the Occasion the Wonder would change its Prospect and one would be as much amazed to think how and where they should be supply'd  The particular Government of these Yards is very remarkable the Commissioners Clerks Accomptants  c  within Doors the Storekeepers Yardkeepers Dockkeepers Watchmen and all other Officers without Doors with the Subordination of all Officers one to another respectively as their Degrees and Offices require The Watchmen are set duly every Night at stated and certain Places within the several Yards with every one a Bell over his Head which they ring or toll every Hour giving so many Strokes as the Hour reckons and then one taking it from another through every Part of the Yard and of all the Yards makes the Watch be perform'd in a very exact and regular manner In the River is a Guardboat which like the Mainguard in a Garison rows the Grand Rounds at certain  Times by every Ship in the River to see that the People on board are at their Post If the Man placed to look out in each Ship does not call  Who comes there  the Guardboat boards it immediately to examine into the Defect of Duty  The Expedition that has been sometimes used here in fitting out Men of War is scarce credible for the Workmen told us That the  Royal Sovereign  a First Rate of Guns was riding at her Moorings intirely unrigg'd and nothing but her three Masts standing as is usual when a Ship is laid up and that she was completely rigg'd all her Masts up her Yards put to her Sails bent Anchors and Cables on board and the Ship sailed down to  BlackStakes  in Three Days Sir  Cloudesly Shovell  being then her Captain  I do not vouch the Thing but when I consider first that every thing lay ready in her Storehouses and wanted nothing but to be brought out and carried on Board a Thousand or Fifteen hundred Men to be employ'd in it and more if they were wanted and every Man knowing his Business perfectly well Boats Carriages Pullies Tackles Cranes and Hulk all ready I do not know but it might be done in one Day if it was tried Certain it is the Dexterity of the  English  Sailors in those things is not to be matched by any in the World  The Buildingyards Docks Timberyard Dealyard Mastyard Gunyard Ropewalks and all the other Yards and Places set apart for the Works belonging to the Navy are like a wellorder'd City and tho' you see the whole Place as it were in the utmost Hurry yet you see no Confusion every Man knows his own Business the Masterbuilders appoint the Working or Converting as they call it of every Piece of Timber and give to the other Headworkmen or Foremen their Moulds for the squaring and cutting out of every Piece and placing it in its proper Byrth so they call it in the Ship that is in  Building and every Hand is busy in pursuing those Directions and so in all the other Works  Rochester  has a Market on  Fridays  and it hath by Grant from King  Henry  I two annual Fairs  viz May  the th and  Nov  the th The Ground on that Side of the Town next the River is very low and marshy being overflowed by every high Tide which renders the Situation unpleasant and the Air unwholsome from the Vapours which arise from these salt Marshes  It may not be amiss in this Place to take Notice that there is in the River  Medway  at  Rochester  and in several of its Creeks and Branches within the Jurisdiction of the City an OysterFishery which is free to every one who has served Seven Years Apprenticeship to any Fisherman or Dredger who is free of the said Fishery and the Mayor and Citizens of  Rochester  hold a Court commonly call'd  An AdmiraltyCourt  once a Year or oftener when Occasions have required it for the regulating of the said Fishery and to prevent Abuses committed in it In these Courts they appoint from Time to Time when Oysters shall and shall not be dredged and taken which they call  Opening and Shutting the Grounds  after the Quantity each Dredgerman shall take in a Day which is usually called  Setting the Stint  They have a Power to go on board and enforce these Orders and when they have found them not duly observed or that the  Brood  or  Spat  has been taken which should have been preserved they seize and throw into the River and Creeks the  Brood  or such Oysters as have exceeded the prescribed Quantity  Persons who dredge or fish for Oysters not being Free of the Fishery are called  Cablehangers  and are presented and punished by the Court Every licensed Dredger pays six Shillings and Eightpence yearly to the Support of the Courts But several licentious Persons having in Process of Time contested  the Authority of this Court and great Inconveniences arising from it to the endangering the Fishery and to the Destruction of all good Order and Rule the Corporation and Free Dredgermen apply'd to Parliament and an Act passed  Anno  establishing the Jurisdiction of the City of  Rochester  and enforcing the Authority of the said Courts and since that another Act explaining and supplying Defects so that at present this Fishery is in a flourishing Condition and all the fair Dealers in this Commodity find their Account in it  It is about sixteen or eighteen Miles from  Rochester  Bridge to  Sheerness  Fort by Water on the River  Medway  of this it is about fourteen Miles to  Blackstakes  the Chanel is so deep all the Way the Banks so soft and the Reaches of the River so short that in a Word 'tis the safest and best Harbour in the World and we saw two Ships of eighty Guns each riding afloat at Lowwater within Musquetshot of  Rochester  Bridge The Ships ride as in a Millpond or a Wetdock except that being moored at the Chains they swing up and down with the Tide but as there is Room enough they are moored in such manner that they cannot swing foul of one another nor did I ever hear of any Accident that befel any of the King's Ships here by Storms and Weather except in that dreadful Tempest in when the  Royal Catharine  was driven on Shore and receiving some Damage sunk and the Ship also being old could not be weigh'd again  There are Two Castles on the Shore of this River the one at  Upnor  where is a good Platform of Guns and which guards Two Reaches of the River and is supposed to defend all the Ships which ride above between that and the Bridge also on the other Shore is  Gillingham  Castle form'd for the same Purpose and well furnish'd with Guns which command the River besides which there is a Fort or Platform of Guns at a Place call'd  The Swamp  and  another at  Cockham  Wood But these are principally added since the Time that the  Dutch  made that memorable Attempt upon the Royal Navy in this River on the d of  June  in the Year for at that Time all was left unguarded and there were but Four Guns that could be used at  Upnor  and scarce so many at  Gillingham  the Carriages being rotten and broken and in a Word every thing concurring to invite the Enemy There were about Twelve Guns at the Isle of  Shepey  where now  Sheerness  Fort is built but the  Dutch  soon dismounted most of them after which they went boldly up to  Blackstakes  with their whole Squadron and after that Seven of their biggest Men of War went up as high as  Upnor  where they did what Mischief they could and went away again carrying off the  Royal Charles  a Firstrate Ship of Guns and burning the  London  and several others besides damaging most of the Ships that were within their Reach and all things consider'd it was a Wonder that they went away without ruining all the rest of the Navy that was in that River  This Alarm gave  England  such a Sense of the Consequence of the River  Medway  and of the Docks and Yards at  Chatham  and of the Danger the Royal Navy lay exposed to there that all these Doors which were open then are lock'd up and sufficiently barr'd since and 'tis not now in the Power of any Nation unless they were Masters at Land as well as Sea to give us such another Affront for besides all these Castles Lines of Guns and Platforms on each Side the River  Medway  as we go up there is now a Royal Fort built at the Point of the Isle of  Shepey  call'd  Sheerness  which guards that Entrance into the River This is a regular Fortification and has such a Line of heavy Cannon commanding the Mouth of the River that no Fleet of Men of War could attempt to pass by as the  Dutch  did without hazarding being torn to pieces I took a View while I was in  these Parts of  Cobhamhall  six Miles from  Chatham  the Seat of the Earl of  Darnley  a handsome Brickhouse remarkable for the excellent Marble Chimneypieces in most of the Rooms  At  Raynham  Church near  Rochester  we saw several Monuments of the Family of the Earl of  Thanet  and the Steeple is reckoned a Seamark  SHEERNESS  is not only a Fortress but a good Town with several Streets in it and Inhabitants of several Sorts but chiefly such whose Business obliges them to reside here The Officers of the Ordnance have here an Office they being often obliged to be at this Place many Days together especially in Time of War when the Rendezvous of the Fleet is at the  Nore  to see to the furnishing every Ship with military Stores as Need requires and to cheque the Officers of the Ships in their Demands of those Stores and the like  Here is also a Yard for building Ships with a Dock intended chiefly for repairing Ships that may meet with any sudden Accident But then it is to observed that those are generally but for Fifth and Sixthrate Ships small Frigates Yachts and such Vessels tho' once when I was there I saw one upon the Stocks of Sixtyfour Guns This Yard is a late Thing also and built many Years since the Fort  ShepeyIsle  is supposed to be so called from its being one of the first Places in  England  where Sheep were kept or from its affording a great Plenty of those useful Animals This Island is encompassed with the mix'd Waters of the  Thames  and the  Medway  on the West with the  Swalle  on the South and with the main Ocean on the North and East It hath great Plenty of good Corn but wants Wood It is about twentyone Miles in Compass  Here are several  Tumuli  in the marshy Parts all over the Island some of which the Inhabitants call  Coterels  these are supposed to have been cast up in  Memory of some of the  Danish  Leaders who were buried here for the  Danes  have often made this Island the Scene of their Ravages and Plunder  There was antiently a Bridge and Causeway between this  Isle  and  Harty  this was called  Thrembethebridge  as afterwards the Ferry was called  TremodFerry  The common Way into this Island from the main Land of  Kent  is by  King'sFerry  where a long Cable of about a hundred and forty Fathom being fastened at each End across the Water serves to get over the Boat by hand  On the main Side of the Ferry is a small Stonebuilding which will hold Nine or Ten Persons this is said to have been erected by one  George Fox  who staying once there a long while in the Cold waiting for the Ferryboat and being much affected with it he built this Place to shelter others from the like Inconvenience For the Maintenance of this Ferry and keeping up the Highway leading to it thro' the Marshes for above a Mile in length the Land Occupiers tax themselves one Penny  per  Acre for fresh Marshland and one Penny for every Ten Acres of salt Marshland  per Ann  This Tax together with some Lands belonging to the Ferry has from time to time kept the said Ferry and Causeway with a Wall against the Sea in good Repair as also the  Boats Cables  and a House for the Ferrykeeper who is obliged to tow all Travellers over free except on four Days yearly  viz Palmmonday Whitmonday St James'sday  and  Michaelmas  when a Horseman pays Twopence and a Footman one Penny But on  Sundays  or after Eight o'Clock at Night there is no Passage  gratis  so that at such Times the Ferrykeeper will demand Sixpence of every Horseman and Twopence of every Footman and in these Cases the Land Occupiers pay as well as Strangers The Keeper of this Ferry is allowed  l per Ann  by the Land Occupiers beside what he  makes in carrying over Passengers in the Nighttime and on  Sundays  And to this he has another Perquisite added which is to dredge for Oysters within the Compass of his  Ferryloop  which extends one Tow's Length as they term it  i e  sixty Fathoms on each Side of the Castle  In the upper Grounds of this Island is great Plenty of good Corn but equal Scarcity of fresh Water most of their Springs being brackish tho' within a few Years past a Well was sunk so deep as to lie below the Bed of the Sea which has furnish'd the Garison at  Sheerness  with fresh Water but before this the People of the Garison had a Yacht which was employ'd in bringing fresh Water from  Deptford    A great Number of Marine Plants grow in the salt Marshes which occasions the Curious in Botany to visit this Island frequently in the midst of Summer when the Plants are in their Perfection  At the Southwest Point of the Isle of  Shepey  where the East  Swale  parts from the West and passes on as above stands  Queenborough  so called by King  Edward  III in Honour of his Queen  Philippa  Daughter to  William  Earl of  Hainault  and  Holland  Here was a Castle erected by King  Edward  as a Defence of the Mouth of the River  Medway  In the Building of this Castle that Prince was assisted by  William of Wickham  who was then Surveyor of the King's Works and afterwards made Bishop of  Winchester  This Castle was afterwards repaired in the Year by King  Henry  VIII who at the same time built others at  Deal Walmer  c for the Defence of the Seacoasts The Governors of  Queenborough  Castle were formerly honoured with the Title of Constable and by the List of them it appears that many of them were Men of great Consideration  This Castle was standing in the Year for Mr  Johnston  in his little Book intituled  Iter Plantarum Investigationis ergo susceptum  tells us That he saw there a noble large Diningroom or Hall round the Top of which were placed the Arms of the Nobility and Gentry of  Kent  and in the Middle those of Queen  Elizabeth  with the following  Latin  Verses under in great Letters  Lilia virgineum pectus regale leonis  Significant vivas virgo regas{que} leo  Umbra placet vultus vultus quia mentis imago  Mentis imago placet mens quia plena Deo  Virgo Deum vita regina imitata regendo  Viva mihi vivi fiat imago Dei  Qui Leo de Juda est et Flos de Jesse leones  Protegat et flores  Elizabetha  tuos  A D  In  English  thus  Lilies the Lion's Virgin Breast explain  Then live a Virgin and a Lion reign  Pictures are pleasing for the Mind they shew  And in the Mind the Deity we view  May she who God in Life and Empire shows  To me th' eternal Deity disclose  May  Jesse  's Flow'r and  Judah  's Lion deign  Thy Flow'rs and Lions to protect O Queen  A D    At present there are not any Remains of this Castle to be seen the Ground where it stood is moated round and there is a Well about Fathom deep still remaining By the several Ordinances which were made by King  Edward  III relating to Naval Affairs it appears this Place was then very famous but at present it is a miserable dirty Fishingtown yet has a Mayor Aldermen  c  and sends Two Burgesses  to Parliament altho' the chief Traders of this Town seem to be Alehousekeepers and Oystercatchers and their Votes at an Election for Parliamentmen are the principal Branch of their scandalous Traffick A pernicious Practice too much followed in better Towns and which may one Day be of fatal Consequence to the Liberties of  Britain    Here we took Boat and went up the  East Swale  to  Milton  or  Middleton  as formerly called which lies as it were hid among the Creeks for 'tis almost out of Sight as well by Water as by Land and yet it is a large Town has a considerable  Saturday  Market for Corn Fruit and other Provisions and the Oysters taken in the Grounds about this Town are the most famous of any in  Kent  This Town is governed by an Officer who is called by the old  Saxon  Name  Portreve  he is chosen annually on St  James  's  day  and he supervises the Weights and Measures all over the Hundred of  Milton  It had antiently a Royal Palace for the  Kentish  Kings  From hence keeping the Coast and the great Road together for they are still within View of one another we come to  Sittingburn  formerly a Markettown but still a considerable Thoroughfare and full of good Inns  Just by the Town are the Ruins of a Fortification raised by King  Alfred  when in Pursuit of the  Danes  called  Bavordcastle  They boast here much of one  Norwood  having entertained King  Henry  V on his triumphant Return from  France  and tho' the Entertainment was according to the Times very elegant yet the whole Expence of it amounted to no more than  s  and  d  From  Sittingburn  we came to  Feversham  which is a large fair Town having one long and broad Street it has a very good Markethouse where the Market is kept on  Wednesdays  and  Saturdays  and  there are Two annual Fairs in this Town of Ten Days each  viz  on  February  the th and on  August  the st This Town is well peopled and in a very flourishing State being in the Neighbourhood of one of the best Parts of  Kent  and having a very commodious Creek to bring in or carry out their Goods but many of the Inhabitants have carried on the Smuggling Trade for Years for which this Creek lies very convenient  Brandy  and often  French Wines  are sold here at very low Rates especially at such times as the Smugglers have been apprehensive of Discovery to prevent which they have been known to sell their Wines to any Persons who would venture to purchase them for  d per  Quart  The Fishermen here have a very good Custom They will admit no one to take out his Freedom unless he be a married Man The Trade for Oysters here with the  Dutch  is so large as to bring in between and  l per Annum  ready Money from  Holland  for this Commodity only  At  Feversham  are the Remains of a Monastery founded by King  Stephen  where he was buried with his Family At present nothing is left but two Gatehouses of mean Structure At the Dissolution they say the Coffin of Lead which held the Royal Body was taken up and sold but the Corps was thrown into the  Thames  and taken up by some Fishermen Here in the Year King  Ethelstan  enacted Laws  It was at the Mouth of this  Swale  namely at  Shellness  so called from the Abundance of Oystershells always lying there that the Smack in which the late King  James  II embarked for his Escape into  France  ran on Shore and being boarded by the Fishermen the King was taken Prisoner and I must mention it to the Reproach of the People of  Feversham  whatever the Conduct of that unfortunate  Prince had been that the Fishermen and Rabble treated him even after they were told who he was with the utmost Indecency using his Majesty with such personal Indignity and giving him such opprobrious and abusive Language and searching him in so rude a manner that the King himself said  he was never more apprehensive of losing his Life than at that Time  He was afterwards carried by them up to the Town where he was not much better treated for some time till some neighbouring Gentlemen of the County came in who understood their Duty better by whom he was preserved from farther Violence till Coaches and a Guard came from  London  by the Prince of  Orange  's Order to conduct him with Safety and Freedom to  London  where he was much better received  While I was near this Town some Years before a terrible Accident happened namely the blowing up of a Powdermill which stood upon the River close to the Town the Blast shatter'd the whole Town broke the Windows blew down Chimneys and Gableends and several People were killed at the Powderhouse itself tho' not any as I remember in the Town But what was most remarkable in it all was that the eldest Son of the Master of the Powdermill a Youth of about Fifteen Years of Age who was not in the Mill or near it when it blew up but in a Boat upon the River rowing cross for his Diversion was killed by a Piece of the Materials of the Mill which were blown up into the Air and fell down upon him in the Boat  After I have mentioned the Tombs of King  Stephen  and his Queen in  Feversham  I know nothing else this Town is remarkable for except the most notorious Smuggling Trade which I have mentioned and which is carried on partly by the Assistance of the  Dutch  in their Oysterboats nay even the Owling Trade or clandestine Exporting of Wool  seems removed from  Romney Marsh  to this Coast and a great deal of it has been carried on between the Mouth of the  EastSwale  and the  North Foreland    From this  EastSwale  and particularly from these last Three Towns  Queenborough Milton  and  Feversham  the Fishmarket at  Billinsgate  is supplied with several Sorts of Fish but particularly with the best and largest Oysters such as some call Stewing others  Milton  Oysters as they are from the  Essex  Side with a smaller and greater Sort called  Wallfleet    I shall now cross the Hills from  Milton  to  Maidstone  on the River  Medway  near Miles distant from  Rochester  to the Southeast  Maidstone  is a very antient Town the River  Medway  over which it has a Bridge is navigable up to it by large Hoys of or Tons Burden the Tide flowing quite up to the Town In an Act passed for making it further navigable of which I shall take proper Notice when I come to speak of the Timber in  Sussex    Here is carried on a Manufacture of Linenthread and likewise in the Neighbourhood are great Plantations of Hops which were supposed to be first planted here at the Beginning of the Reformation which gave Occasion to that old Distich  Hops Reformation Bays  and  Beer  Came into  England  all in a Year  Maidstone  is eminent for Plenty of Provisions for Richness of Lands and for the best Market in the County not excepting either  Rochester  or  Canterbury  It has also a handsome Bridge which in the Opinion of some is inferior only in Length to that of  Rochester    From this Town and the neighbouring Parts  London  is supplied with more Particulars than from any single Markettown in  England  which I mention in pursuance of my first Resolution of observing  how every Part of  England  furnishes something to the City of  London    From the  Weald of Kent  which begins but about Six Miles off and particularly from that Part which lies this Way they being the large  Kentish  Bullocks  From hence are brought great Quantities of the largest Timber for Supply of the King's Yards at  Chatham  and often to  London  most of which is at present brought by Landcarriage to  Maidstone    From the Country adjoining great Quantities of Corn are brought up to  London  also Hops Apples and Cherries  A Kind of Paving Stone about Eight or Ten Inches square exceeding durable used to pave Courtyards  c  Fine white Sand for the Glasshouses esteemed the best in  England  for melting into Flintglass and Lookingglass Plates and for the Stationers Use also vulgarly called Writingsand  All that Side of the County which I have mentioned as it is marshy and unhealthy by its Situation among the Waters is chiefly inhabited by Shipbuilders Fishermen Seafaringmen and Husbandmen and such as depend upon them and very few Families of Note are found among them But as soon as we come down  Boxleyhill  from  Rochester  or  Hollingbournhill  from  Milton  to the wellwatered Plain on the Banks of the  Medway  we find the Country everywhere bespangled with populous Villages and delicious Seats of the Nobility and Gentry and especially on the Northside of the River beginning at  Aylesford  on the  Medway  the Seat of the Earl of that Name and looking East towards the Sea to  Eastwell  near  Ashford  the Seat of the Earl of  Winchelsea    Among these are the antient Families of  Fane Colepeper Deerham Honywood Wotton Roberts Hales  c  This genteel Neighbourhood makes  Maidstone  a very agreeable Place to live in for here is what is not often found namely a Town of very great Business and Trade and yet full of Gentry and good Company  There is not much Manufacturing in this County what is left is chiefly at  Canterbury  and in this Town of  Maidstone  and its Neighbourhood The Manufacture of this Town is principally Linenthread as I have said which they make to pretty good Perfection tho' not extraordinary fine At  Cranbrook Tenterden Goudhurst  and other Villages in the Neighbourhood of this Place was once a considerable Cloathingtrade carried on and the  Yeomen of Kent  of whom so much has been famed and who inhabited these Parts were generally much enriched by it but that Trade is now quite decay'd and scarce Ten Clothiers left in all the County  The Farmers and Descendents of these Clothiers upon the Elections of Members for the County shew themselves still there for there are ordinarily or Freeholders brought from this Side of the County who for the Plainness of their Appearance are called the  Grey Coats of Kent  but are so considerable that whoever they vote for is sure to carry it and therefore the Gentlemen are very careful to preserve their Interest among them  This Town of  Maidstone  is a Peculiar of the Archbishop of  Canterbury  who is the proper Incumbent and puts in a Curate to officiate for him The Archbishop has a Palace here which is esteemed very antient to which there is a Chapel belonging The Architecture is  Gothick  but good of the Kind and some Parts of it have been repaired after the modern Manner  Maidstone  is a  Roman  Station named  Vagniacis  or  Madviacis  from the  British  Word  Maedwaeg  the Meadows on the River  Vaga  which  are here beautiful The Archiepiscopal Palace was founded by  John Ufford  and finished by  Simon Islep  The College or Hospital was erected by Archbishop  Boniface  and a Chantry by  Thomas Anindel  now the Freeschool About the Year several Canoes were dug up made of hollowed Trees in the Marshes of the River  Medway  above  Maidstone  one of which is used for a Boat to this Day In the Hands of Dr  Dodd  at  Addington  near  Malling  in the Year a  British  Coin of Amber was found in the Foundation of a Stone Wall The convex Side was plain on the Concave was a  British  Horse rude enough The Assizes are generally held here and always the County Elections and it is governed by a Mayor and Twelve Jurats  Charing  not far off was the antient  Durolenum  situated upon a Spring of the River  Len  Here the Archbishops of  Canterbury  had a castellated Palace given them by some of the first  Saxon  Kings of which there are large Ruins  In my Way to  Maidstone  on a former Journey I saw  Mareworth  Castle a pretty Fabrick belonging to the Earl of  Westmorland  and on a rising Ground within a Mile of  Aylesford  viewed an Antiquity vulgarly called  Kettscottyhouse  which are three great Stones piled on each other and deemed the Tombs of  Kentigern  and  Horbus  two  Danish  Princes slain in Battle and there bury'd  In prosecuting my Journey from  Maidstone  to  Canterbury  I cannot help mentioning  Lenham  a Town about Miles distant from that City in relation to which the Rt Rev Continuator of  Camden  records the following extraordinary Circumstance  "At  Lenham  says he is a thing exceeding remarkable mentioned on the Tomb of  Robert Thompson    Esq  in the Church there who was Grandchild to that truly religious Matron  Mary Honeywood  Wife of  Robert Honeywood  of  Charing    Esq  She had at her Decease lawfully descended from her Children of her own Body Grandchildren in the third Generation and in the fourth Her Renown liveth with her Posterity her Body lieth in this Church and her Monument may be seen in  Markshall  in  Essex  where she died"  From hence I pursued my Journey to  Canterbury  which all Writers agree was called by the  Britons Kent  and is the  Duroverno  of the  Romans  of which Town and its Antiquities so much has been said and so accurately that I need do no more than mention it briefly However I observe here  That  Augustine  the Monk the first Christian Preacher that came from  Rome  into this Island settled in this Place but that he was the first that preached Christianity in the Island as some have suggested is a Mistake as the famous Conference between him and the Monks of  Banchor  in  Wales  sufficiently testify  That Seven Bishops of  Canterbury  including that  Augustine  lie buried here in one Vault  That  Thomas à Becket  Archbishop of this See insulted the King his Sovereign in an unsufferable Manner insomuch that in the Reign of  Henry  II he was here murdered by the Connivance as some say of the King and they shew what they call his Blood upon the Pavement at this Day  That they shew the Stonesteps ascending to his Shrine he being afterwards canonized worn away to a Slope by the Knees of the Pilgrims who visited it  That the Bodies of King  Henry  IV and of  Edward the Black Prince  are buried here and the magnificent Effigies of the latter very curiously carved lies on his Tomb or Monument Here is a pretty Chapel originally design'd for the Celebration of Masses for the Soul of King  Henry  IV  That the immense Wealth offered by Votaries and Pilgrims for several Ages to the Shrine of  Becket  was such that the famous  Erasmus  who saw it says of it thus  "All shone sparkled glittered with rare and very large Jewels and even in the whole Church appeared a Profuseness above that of Kings"  In short Gold was one of the meanest Treasures of his Shrine and at the Dissolution as  Dugdale  observes the Plate and Jewels filled Two great Chests each whereof required Eight Men to carry out of the Church And  Camden  says the Name of  Christ  to whom it was dedicated was almost laid aside for that of St  Thomas    That all this immense Treasure with the Lands and Revenues of the whole Monastery were seized upon by King  Henry  VIII at the general Suppression of Religious Houses except such as are annexed to the Deanery and Chapter and to the Revenue of the Archbishoprick which are not very considerable There is an old Picture of  Becket  's Martyrdom and an antient Painting upon the Wall of the Siege of  Jerusalem  in the Habits of our Ancestors  Here are also to be seen the Monuments of Cardinal  Courticello  Cardinal  Pole  Archbishop  Chichley  Bp  Peckham  's carved in Wood upwards of Years ago Bishop  Wharton  the Duke of  Clarence  Archbishop  Langton  with many others of less Account  The Cathedral is a large and noble Pile of Building very curious Remnants of painted Glass are still to be seen in the Windows It is intirely vaulted with Stone and of a very pretty Model but much too high for its Breadth as all  Gothick  Buildings were The Metropolitan Chair is of grey Marble standing behind the High Altar The Cloisters are pretty good and near them a very large Chapel called the  Sermonhouse  wainscotted  with  Irish  Oak Under it is a large Protestant  French  Church given first by Queen  Elizabeth  to the  Walloons  who fled hither from the Persecution of the Duke  d'Alva  The Number of these Refugees has been since very much increased by  French  Protestants obliged to leave their native Country thro' the Cruelty of  Louis  XIV  The Close where the Houses of the Prebendaries stand is very spacious and fair and a great many very good Houses are built in it and some with good Gardens  Here are many Remains of  Roman  and  Saxon  Buildings The City is strongly walled about and many Towers at due Intervals a deep Ditch close underneath and a great Rampart of Earth within The Materials of the Walls are chiefly Flint  The Castle was built in the Reign of King  William  I of the same Form and the Walls of the same Thickness with that of  Rochester Dungeonhill  a very high Mount seems to have been Part of the old Castle Opposite to it without the Walls is an Hill seeming to have been raised by the  Danes  when they besieged the City The Top of  Dungeonhill  is equal to the Top of the Castle and exhibits a fine Prospect over the City and Country  Of  Augustine  's Monastery two Gates remain next the City and both very stately Perhaps one belonged to King  Ethelbert  's Palace the other to the Monastery which doubtless was very splendid for it covers a great Compass of Ground and is surrounded with a very high Wall There were continual Quarrels between the Monks of  Augustine  and of  Thomas à Becket  both very rich and very contentious  Near this Monastery is a vast angular Piece of a Tower besides half of another about Feet high which has been undermined by digging away a Course at Bottom in order to be thrown down  but it happened only to disjoint itself from the Foundation and lodged itself in the Ground in the present inclining State Thus being equally poised it presents a View of Terror and forbids a too near Access  The adjacent Close is full of religious Ruins and in a Corner of it are the Walls of a Chapel said to have been a Christian Temple before  Augustine  's Time and reconsecrated by him to St  Pancras  Near it is a little Room said to have been King  Ethelbert  's Pagan Chapel The Vulgar say here are the Marks of the Devil's Claws  Eastward of this and farther out of the City is  St Martin  's Church said to be  Augustine  's first See and the Place whither King  Ethelbert  's Queen used to repair to divine Service It is built mostly of  Roman  Brick In the Middle is a very large old fashioned Font supposed to be that where the King was baptized  North of the City is a very small Remainder of  St Gregory  's Chapel founded probably by  Augustine  to the Honour of that Pope his Patron  The City has been much advantaged by the Settlement in it of Two or Three thousand  French  Protestants Men Women and Children owing to the abovementioned Expulsion of the Protestants under  Louis  XIV  The Employment of those Refugees was chiefly  Broad Silk Weaving  which has suffered several Changes and Alterations but is still carried on here to some Account  But what has added most to the Advantage of  Canterbury  is the Hopgrounds all round the Place to the Amount of several Thousand Acres insomuch that  Canterbury  was for some time the greatest Plantation of Hops in the whole Island but now they have a Rival if not an Overmatch about  Farnham  as I shall observe in its Place  In  January  were found in a Shave belonging to the Estate of Sir  John Hales  who lives in this Neighbourhood and within his Manor of  Tunstall  near  Sittingbourn  several Hundreds of broad Pieces of Gold which were thought to be concealed in the Time of the late Civil Wars by an Ancestor of Sir  John  They were found by a poor Boy who was rambling in the Coppice and not knowing what to make of them was playing with some of them at a Farmer's in the Neighbourhood of  Canterbury  and the Farmer got Possession of them but not being able to keep the Secret he refunded of the Broadpieces for the Use of the Crown Tho' Sir  John  laid Claim to the Whole  The Shore from  Whitstable  and the  EastSwale  affords nothing remarkable but Seamarks and small Towns on the Coast till we came to  Margate  noted for King  William  's frequently Landing here in his Returns from  Holland  and for shipping a vast Quantity of Corn for  London  Market most if not all of it the Product of the Isle of  Thanet  in which it stands There is lately erected here a Saltwater Bath which has performed great Cures in nervous and paralytick Cases and in Numbness of the Limbs and seems every Day to become more and more in Request  But it may not be unacceptable to transcribe a few Lines from  Camden  in Honour to the Industry of the Inhabitants in this Part of the Isle of  Thanet  which I recommend to the  Admiration  for I doubt it would be too much to say  Imitation  of the rest of  Britain  both North and South It is as follows  "Nor must I here omit the mention of a Thing very much to the Honour of the Inhabitants of  Thanet  those especially who live near the Roads or Harbours of  Margate Ramsgate  and  Brodstear  namely that they are exceeding industrious  and are as it were  amphibious Creatures  and get their Living both by Sea and Land they deal in both Elements are both Fishers and Ploughmen both Husbandmen and Mariners and the selfsame Hand that holds the Plough steers the Ship According to the several Seasons they make Nets fish for Cod Herring Mackarel  c  go to Sea themselves and export their own Commodities And those very Men also dung their Ground plough sow harrow reap inn being quick and active in both Employments and so the Course of their Labours runs round And when there happen any Shipwrecks as there do here now and then for those Shallows and Shelves so much dreaded by Seamen lie overagainst it namely the  Godwin  the  Brakes  the  Fourfoot  the  Whitdick  c they are extremely industrious to save the Lading"  I shall only add That it is highly to the Reputation of those People if they continue to deserve this excellent Character but I have heard of some late Instances that are not at all to their Honour in this latter Particular  At  Stanar  in the Isle of  Thanet  the  Rutupiae  of the  Romans  is to be seen the Sepulchre of  Vortimer  King of the antient  Britons  who having vanquished the  Saxons  in many Battles and at last driven them out of the Island ordered before his Death that he should be buried here on a fond Conceit that his Corpse would fright them from landing any more upon this Coast Like the great  Scipio  who having subdued the  Carthaginians  ordered his Tomb to be turned towards  Africa  to fright them from the Coast of  Italy  But the poor  Britons  soon found the Difference between a  King  in the  Field  and  one  in the  Grave    On the Northeast Point of this Land is the Promontory or Headland which I have often  mentioned called the  NorthForeland  which by a Line drawn due North to the  Nase  in  Essex  about Six Miles short of  Harwich  makes the Mouth of the River of  Thames  and the Port of  London  As soon as any Vessels pass this  Foreland  from  London  they are properly said to be in the open Sea if to the North they enter the  German  Ocean if to the South the Chanel as 'tis called that is the narrow Seas between  England  and  France  and all the Towns or Harbours before we come this Length whether on the  Kentish  or  Essex  Shore are called Members of the Port of  London    From this Point Westward the first Town of Note is  Ramsgate  a small Port the Inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it  Romansgate  pretending that the  Romans  under  Julius Caesar  made their first Attempt to land here and that being driven back by a Storm he soon returned and coming on Shore with a good Body of Troops beat back the  Britons  and fortify'd his Camp just at the Entrance of the Creek where the Town now stands while others as positively assert that that great Commander first landed at  Deal  as I shall observe anon  Richboroughcastle  is a Mile distant from  Stanar  and  Sandwich  At the Foot of it runs the River coming from  Canterbury  This River at first discharged itself into the Sea by  Ebbesflete  North of the  Roman  City  Rutupiae  now  Stanar  till the Sand pouring so directly upon it obliged the Stream to slide under the Cliff by  Richboroughcastle  and so by  Sandwich  The Castle is a most noble Remnant of  Roman  Antiquity The Walls on Three Sides are pretty intire and in some Places still about or Feet high without any Ditch The Side next the Sea being upon a kind of Cliff the Top of the Wall is but level with the Ground Here in the latter Times of the Empire the  Legio  II  Aug  was quartered And from the Condition of the  Walls it must have been destroy'd with great Violence probably by the  Saxons  In the Way to  Sandwich  upon an Eminence is the Remainder of an Amphitheatre made of Turf probably for the Exercise and Diversion of the Garison Before  Sandwich  Gates are two  Roman Tumuli  on one of which stands a Windmill And South of  Sandwich  on the Seashore are Six large and broad  Celtic Tumuli  at equal Distances This flat Coast is fenced against the Ocean by the Sanddowns From  Sandwich  as far as  Hythe  the Coast of  France  was visible all the Way as we rode The Reverend Mr  Lewis  has published within these few Years a curious History of the Isle of  Thanet  to which I shall refer for several Particulars which deserve the Attention of a Traveller  Sandwich  one of the Cinqueports lies in the Bottom of a Bay at the Mouth of the River  Stour  formerly a Town of great Repute and Trade It decay'd in the  Saxons  Time and was utterly ruined by the  Danes  Being raised again it had the Misfortune to be reduced to Ashes in King  John  's Reign after which it was rebuilt But in the Reign of Q  Mary  the Mouth of its Harbour was so choaked up by a Ship of great Burden which sunk in it and gave Opportunity to the Sands and Beach so to fill it up that it was incurable the Town of consequence fell to Decay and it is now a very poor Place  Sandwich  is noted for Carrots which are brought to  London  during the Winter Season and from hence it is that most of the Markets are supplied with these Roots which are esteemed the sweetest as they are also the largest which are produced in  England  or perhaps in  Europe    From this Place also the Seedsmen in  London  are furnished with the greatest Quantity of their Seeds the Land being light sandy and fresh is very good  for producing most Sorts of Seeds and the Ground being pretty low the Seeds do not so often receive a Blight as in many other Places  Not far from hence is  Wingham  which gives Title of Baron to Earl  Cowper  From hence I went to  Deal  called by  Caesar Dola  having landed not far from this Place It is the famous Road for Shipping so well known all over the trading World by the Name of the  Downs  and where almost all Ships which arrive from Foreign Parts for  London  or go from  London  to Foreign Parts and pass the Chanel generally stop the Homewardbound to dispatch Letters send their Merchants and Owners the good News of their Arrival and set their Passengers on Shore and the Outwardbound to take in fresh Provisions to receive their last Orders Letters and Farewels from Owners and Friends  c  Sometimes when the Wind presents fair Ships come in here and pass thro' at once without coming to an Anchor for they are not obliged to stop but for their own Convenience  The  Downs  would be a very wild and dangerous Road for Ships were it not for the  SouthForeland  a Head of Land forming the East Point of the  Kentish  Shore and is called the  South  as its Situation respects the  NorthForeland  and which breaks the Sea off which would otherwise come rolling up from the West to the Flats or Bank of Sands which for Three Leagues together and at about a League or League and half Distance run parallel with the Shore and are dry at low Water so that these two breaking all the Force of the Sea on the East South and Southwest make the  Downs  accounted a very good Road  And yet on some particular Winds and especially if they overblow the  Downs  proves such a wild Road that Ships are driven from their Anchors and often run on Shore or are forced on the said Sands  or into  Sandwichbay  or  Ramsgatepier  in great Distress this is particularly when the Wind blows hard at Southeast or at Eastbynorth or Eastnortheast and some other Points and terrible Havock has been made in the  Downs  at such times  But the most unhappy Instance that can be given of any Disaster in the  Downs  was in the time of that terrible Tempest which we call by way of Distinction  The Great Storm  being on the th of  Nov  Unhappy in particular for that there chanced at that time to be a great Part of the Royal Navy come into the  Downs  in their way to  Chatham  to be laid up  Five of the biggest Ships had the good Fortune to push thro' the  Downs  the Day before finding the Wind then blew very hard and were come to an Anchor at the  Gunfleet  and had they had but one fair Day more they had been all safe at the  Nore  or in the River  Medway  at  Blackstakes    There remained in the  Downs  about Sail when this terrible Tempest began at which time  England  may be said to have received the greatest Loss that ever happened to the Royal Navy at one time either by Weather by Enemies or by any Accident whatsoever The short Account of it is as follows  The  Northumberland  a Third Rate carrying Guns and Men the  Restoration  a Second Rate carrying Guns and Men the  Sterling Castle  a Second Rate carrying Guns and Men but had only Men on board and the  Mary  a Third Rate of Guns having Men on board these were all lost with all their Men except one Man out of the  Mary  and Men out of the  SterlingCastle  who were taken up by Boats from  Deal    All this is besides the Loss of Merchants Ships which was exceeding great not here only but in almost all the Ports in the South and West of  England  and also in  Ireland    The Town of  Deal  carries on some Foreign Trade and is very much improved of late Years to which the great Resort of Seamen to it from the Ships in the  Downs  has not a little contributed  I took a Niew of  Sandowncastle Deal  and  Walmercastles    Sandowncastle  is composed of four Lunets of very thick arched Work of Stone with many Portholes for great Guns In the Middle is a great round Tower with a Cistern attop and underneath an arched Cavern Bombproof A Foss encompasses the Whole to which is a Passage over a Drawbridge  Dealcastle  and  Walmercastle  are like the former all built as I have said by K  Henry  VIII to guard this Coast Between  Walmercastle  and  Deal  was probably the Spot where  Caesar  landed in his first Expedition because it is the first Place where the Shore can be ascended North of  Dover  and exactly answers his assigned Distance of eight Miles In his second Expedition with many more Ships and upon a perfect Knowledge of the Country he might land at  Deal    Dover  stands in a most romantick Situation it is a great Valley and the only one about this Coast where Water is admitted inwards of the Cliff which is here very high The Sea formerly came a good way higher up and made a large Port Anchors have been found above the Town The  Roman  City  Dubris  was to the South of the River The  Watling street  enters it as  Bigingate  coming very strait from  Canterbury  over  Barhamdown  where it is very perfect Some of the Walls are left The Churches are of a very antique Make that of  St Martin  is Collegiate founded by  Wightred  King of  Kent  and is a venerable Ruin It was built in Form of a Cross Of the Priory now a Farmhouse are large Remains The Hospital overagainst it is made a Storehouse Here the Knights Hospitalers or Templers lodged as they came into  or went out of the Kingdom The Piers which form the Haven or large Bason are costly and great Works Above is a Fort with four Bastions of modern Date The broad Beach which lies at the Mouth of this great Valley and was the Harbour in  Caesar  's Time is very delightful One long Street here is nam'd  Snaregate  from the most tremendous Rocks of Chalk which project directly over the Houses  Dover  Castle is very large and situated upon a Rock rugged and steep on every Side but towards the Sea it rises to an extraordinary Height Tho' of late Years neglected it was once so well fortify'd and of such Importance as to be accounted the Key of  England  And  William the Conqueror  when he had an Eye upon the Kingdom took an Oath of  Harold  that he should deliver into his Hands this Castle with the Well which is Sixty Fathoms deep and said to be the Work of  Julius Caesar  In short it was the strongest old Fortification in the World and takes up thirty Acres of Ground  In the late War with  France  Prisoners were confined in the great Castle The Brass Gun call'd  Queen  Elizabeth  's PocketPistol  is a great Curiosity twentytwo Feet long It is excellently well wrought requires Fifteen Pounds of Powder and carries a Ball Seven Miles Here are Two very old Keys and a brass Horn which seem to be the Ensigns of Authority belonging to the Constable of the Castle or Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports One Part of the Fortifications consists of a circular Work in which stands an old Church said to have been built by  Lucius  the first Christian King in  Britain  out of some of the  Roman  Ruins for there are huge Quantities of  Roman  Brick laid into the Work and the Remainder is of Stone originally cut by the  Romans  It is in Form of a Cross and has a square Tower in the Middle The Stone Windows are of  much later Date than the Building but the greatest Curiosity is the Pharos or  Roman  Watchtower standing at the Westend of the Church This Building was made use of as a Steeple and had a pleasant Ring of Bells which Sir  George Rooke  procur'd to be carried away to  Portsmouth  Since when the Lead which cover'd it has been taken away by Order of the Officers of Ordnance so that this rare Piece of Architecture is left exposed to the Sea and Weather Here was found a Coin of  Dioclesian  The  Erpinghams  Arms are patch'd up against one Side of the  Pharos  so that it seems to have been repair'd in the Days of King  Henry  V when the Lord  Erpingham  was Warden of  Dovercastle    Upon another Rock overagainst that on which the Castle is situated and almost as high are the Remains of an old Watchtower now vulgarly called  Bredenstone  otherwise  Devil'sdrop  from the Strength of the Mortar Here the new Constable of the Castle is sworn Under this Place King  Henry  VIII built the Mole or Pile called the  Pier  that Ships might ride therein with great Safety But tho' it was done with vast Labour and Expence by large Beams fastened in the Sea bound together with Iron and great Piles of Wood and Stone heap'd upon all yet the Fury of the Sea was soon too hard for the Work and the Timbers beginning to disjoint Queen  Elizabeth  expended great Sums upon it And several Acts have passed to repair and restore the same which also including the Restoration and Preservation of the Harbour of  Rye  I shall take Notice of both when I mention that of  Rye    Dover  the  Portus Dubris  of the  Romans  is one of the Cinque Ports and was formerly bound to send twentyone Ships for the Wars It affords a See to the Suffragan of the Archbishop of  Canterbury  as often as any such is appointed Most of the Business relating to these Ports in general is done  and all the Courts kept here The other Cinque Ports are  Hastings Hythe Romney  and  Sandwich Hastings  has two Appendages namely  Winchelsea  and  Rye  which as well as  Hastings  are in  Sussex  and the others in  Kent  they have all great Privileges their Burgesses are called Barons who on the Coronations of our Sovereigns support the Canopies over their Heads have a Table at the King's Right Hand the Canopy for their Fee and enjoy other Privileges The Lord Warden of these Five Ports is generally one of the first Noblemen in the Kingdom  The Packets for  France  go off here as also those for  Ostend  with the Mails for  Flanders  and all those Ships which carry Freights from  NewYork  to  Holland  and from  Virginia  to  Holland  come generally hither and unlade their Goods enter them with the Customhouse Officers pay the Duties and then enter them again by Certificate reload them and draw back the Duty by Debenture and so they go away for  Holland    As we pass from  Dover  to the smaller Cinque Ports of  Hythe Romney  and  Rye  we see  Folkstone  a little Village now which the Sea has made great Inroads upon but which formerly made a greater Figure A copious Spring went thro' the Town Two Pieces of old Wall seemingly  Roman  hang frightfully over the Cliff Here are some old Guns one of Iron of a very odd Cast doubtless as old as the Time of King  Henry  VIII Many  Roman  Coins have also been found And here a Nunnery was built by  Eanswide  Daughter of  Eadbald  King of  Kent  This Place is now principally of Note for a Multitude of Fishingboats belonging to it which are one Part of the Year employed in catching Mackarel for the City of  London  The  Folkstone  Men catch them and the  London  and  Barking  MackarelSmacks of which I have spoken  at large in  Essex  come down and buy them and whisk away to Market under such a Croud of Sails that one would wonder they could bear them About  Michaelmas  these  Folkstone  Barks among others from  Shoreham Brighthelmston  and  Rye  go away to  Yarmouth  and  Leostoff  on the Coast of  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  and catch Herrings for the Merchants there It hath been observed of some Hills in the Neighbourhood of  Folkstone  as the Right Rev Continuator of  Camden  takes Notice that they have visibly sunk and grown lower within the Memory of Man  Sandgate  Castle situated in the Bottom of Two Hills on the Seashore hath about Sixteen Guns to defend the Fishingcraft from the Insults of Privateers in Time of War it hath several good Houses about it and was built by King  Henry  VIII  After we have passed this Castle we enter upon the Beach Here are many Springs which descending from the higher Ground sink immediately into this Beach rendering it a little boggy  Hythe  one of the Cinque Ports stands on the Edge of the less Ridge but the Marsh has intercepted it from the Sea  Hythe  in  Saxon  signifies a  Port  or  Station  but at present it hardly answers the Name for the Sands have so choaked it up that the Sea is shut out from it to a great Distance This Town as also  WestHythe  from which the Sea retir'd above Years ago owe their Original to  Lemanis  or  Limne  a  Roman  Port of which more anon now a little Village adjoining which was formerly a very famous Port before it was shut up with Sands thrown in by the Sea which gave Rise to the two  Hythes  beforementioned which in their Turns have met with the same Fate A particular Providence happened at  Hythe April  About Eleven o'Clock the Steeple of their Church in which were  Six Bells fell down About Ten Persons were present when it fell waiting in the Churchporch for the Keys to go up into the Steeple for a View but some Delay being made in bringing them they happily receiv'd no other Damage than being terribly frightened In a Vault under the Church we saw a vast Heap of human Bones some of an extraordinary Size said to be gathered up after a bloody Battle fought between the  Britons  and  Danes    About a Mile distant from it is  SaltwoodCastle  a very strong Seat of the Archbishop of  Canterbury  The outer Wall has Towers and Battlements and a deep Ditch Within and on one Side stands the main Body of the Palace There are two great and high Towers at the Gate of this over which are the Arms of Archbishop  Courtney  the Founder This inner Work has a stronger and higher Wall with a broad embattled Parapet at top Within is a Court but the Lodgings are all demolish'd The Floor of the ruinous Chapel is strongly vaulted In the Middle of the Court is a large square Well seemingly  Roman  They say that Anchors have been dug up hereabouts which makes it likely that the  Romans  had here an Iron Forge and some will have it that the Sea came up formerly to it and ground this Opinion on these Anchors found here  A little Way further at the End of the  Stanestreet  the  Roman  Road from  Canterbury  is the Port of  Lemanis  or  Limne  mention'd above At  Limne  Church from the Brow of the Hill may be discern'd the ruinous  Roman  Walls situate almost at the Bottom of the Marshes A pretty Brook which rises from the Rock West of the Church runs for some Space on the East Side of the Wall then passes thro' it and so along its lowermost Edge by the Farmhouse at Bottom here Coins have been found Once the Seabank broke and admitted the Ocean into all the adjacent Marshes  The Port is now call'd  Shipway  where the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was formerly sworn the Courts kept and all the Pleas relating thereto till  Dover  superseded it The People of  Limne  had a Horn and Mace the remaining Ensigns of their Authority  Romney  is a large fine Village and likewise a Cinque Port it is the chief Town of the MarshGrounds which were antiently part of the Sea called  Romney Marsh  and has  Old Romney  and  Lech  for its Members It is seated on a high Hill of Gravel and Sand and on the West Side of it had a pretty large Harbour guarded against most of the Winds before the Sea retir'd from it In the Year when the Town was at its Height it was divided into Twelve Wards had Five Parish Churches a Priory and an Hospital for the Sick But it has been dwindling till it came to its present low Condition ever since the Reign of  Edward  I when an Inundation of the Sea destroy'd Men Cattle and Houses threw down a whole populous Village called  PromHill  and remov'd the  Rother  in  British  Yz Odz which used to empty itself into the Sea at  Romney  out of its Chanel stopping up its Mouth and opening it a nearer Passage into the Sea by  Rye  leaving here only a little Bay for Fishingboats  From  RomneyMarsh  the Shore extends itself a great way into the Sea and makes that Point of Land called  Dengyness  Just by the River  Rother  stands the little Town of  Appledore  which by Disuse has lost its Market and is of no Note now The Sea formerly came up to it  Tenterden  a Mayor Markettown lies a little to the N W of  Appledore  near the  Weald  It has a very good and high Steeple which they say was the Cause of the  GodwinSands  which was an Estate that belonged to Earl  Godwin  and was guarded  from the Sea by a Wall but they were so intent on building the Steeple that the Wall was neglected and the Land overflowed which they could never afterwards recover  Ashford  also a Mayortown stands on the great Road upon the River  Stour  It is a pretty well built Markettown The Church is large and was formerly Collegiate they hold Pleas for any thing not exceeding twenty Marks  Newenden  deserves to be mentioned for what it once was having been formerly a fine City which  Camden  calls  Anderida  It was destroy'd by the  Saxons  but rebuilt in the Reign of  Edward  I and called  Newenden  as much as to say according to  Camden  's Etymology a new City in a little Valley It had then an Harbour much frequented but it is now a most miserable Village with a few poor Houses in it the best an Alehouse and the Church is illbuilt and out of Repair It has a very indifferent Bridge over the  Rother  a rapid River which divides at this Place  Kent  from  Sussex  and about Nine Miles off empties itself into the Harbour of  Rye Roman  Coins have been dug up here  Northwest of  Newenden  is  Cranbrook  a large Markettown noted for having been one of the first Places where the Clothmanufacture was set up in  England  which is now very much in its Wane here But here I will conclude my Third Letter and am Sir  Yours  c  LETTER IV CONTAINING A  DESCRIPTION  of the County of  SUSSEX  other Parts of  KENT  and Part of  HANTS SURREY  c  SIR  _I NOW enter the County of  Sussex  and shall begin my Letter with the Account of  Rye    It is situated in the most Eastern Part of  Sussex  upon an Hill which is encompassed with Rocks that are inaccessible on the Seaside There is nothing now but some Remains of its old Walls to be seen and the Ditches are almost filled up Its Trade is in Hops Wool Timber Kettles Cannon Chimneybacks  c  which are cast at the Ironworks at  Bakely  about Four Miles from  Rye  on the Northwest and  Breed  about Five Miles distant Southwest It is a very great Misfortune that its Harbour has been so much damaged by the Sea and neglected for it is almost filled up in several Places where it was formerly the deepest and most convenient Some considerable Families who have Lands near have taken Advantage of this to extend  them further upon those Sands which the Sea in Storms has thrown up against them and by digging Ditches and making Drains there are now Fields and Meadows where antiently was nothing but Water By this means Ships only of a middle Size can come within any convenient Distance of the Town whereas formerly the largest Vessels and even whole Fleets together could anchor just by the Rocks on which the Town stands and as this Port lies overagainst  Dieppe  in  France  and that there is no other Port between  Portsmouth  and  Dover  which can receive Ships of Burden not only the Danger of the Sea but in Time of War of the Enemy were escaped by the Conveniency of this Harbour But it being by the Means I have mentioned and by the Inning of the Chanel and waste Lands which prevented the Flux and Reflux of the Tide in Danger of being utterly lost an Act of Parliament passed in which enacts That no new Walls Banks Dams or Stops shall thereafter be erected on either Side of the Water that might stop or alter the Flux or Reflux of the Sea between the Mouth of the Harbour bounded by the  Camber  and  CastlePoints  and  New Shutt  near  Craven  Sluice  In another Act passed for completing the Repairs of the Harbour of  Dover  and for restoreing the Harbour of  Rye  to its antient Goodness which still continued to be choak'd up and almost ruin'd by the Shifting of the Beach without and Settling of the Sullage within and stopping the Flux of the Tide which this Act proposed should have its free Course thro' the  Scotchflat  and  Craven  Sluices or into such other Cut or Chanel as should be found most proper and expedient  And in another Act passed for making the last Act more effectual so far as it related to the Harbour of  Rye  in which a Power was given to  change the Design of making a Passage by the abovenamed Sluices and to open a new Cut from the  Winchelsea  Chanel right out to the Sea And they actually began in pursuance of this Act to cut a broad and deep Canal which was to be carried to the Sea on the Side of  Winchelsea  for the Use of the two Boroughs But still these Provisions being found insufficient another Act pass'd in for continuing the Term and Powers granted by the former Acts for repairing the Harbour of  Dover  and for restoring that of  Rye  to its antient Goodness to which I must refer the Reader  The Houses of  Rye  are wellenough built and of Brick tho' generally oldfashion'd but there are some very neat ones of a modern Taste There is a small Settlement of  French  Refugees in this Town mostly Fishermen they have a Minister of their own who is paid by the Archbishop of  Canterbury  The Church is handsome and large but there are so many Dissenters in the Town and so few of the Establish'd Church that they have wall'd off and converted the Western Part of it into a Magazine for Planks But there are two wellbuilt Meetinghouses one for the Presbyterians and the other for the Quakers Another Church which belong'd to a Monastery now demolish'd is also turn'd into a kind of Storehouse for Planks Hops and other Merchandize At the Northeast of  Rye  are the Remains of an old Fort which commands the Town and Harbour and serves for the Towngaol  His late Majesty King  George  I on his Return from  Hanover January  was obliged to put in here after a very dangerous and tempestuous Passage the Fleet being unable to make  Dover  and it was then experienced what a Benefit it would have been to have had this only considerable Haven as it formerly was between  Portsmouth  and  Dover  restor'd to its pristine flourishing State for his Majesty  was under great Difficulties to land there and the larger Ships were unable to follow him  This Town was as I have said one of the Appendages as  Winchelsea  was the other to  Hastings  as a Cinqueport and enjoy'd the same Privileges  Old Winchelsea  stood upon the Seashore about Two or Three Miles from the Place where the  New  stands It had formerly a large and spacious Harbour was a Place of great Trade and had no less than Eighteen Churches in it But it was intirely destroyed by the Sea and that small Part which is not bury'd in the Sands is now Marsh and Meadowland To the S E of  Rye  and the N W of  New Winchelsea  is still to be seen in the Midst of a large Plain an old Tower which probably stood by the Sea  New Winchelsea  is said to have been built by King  Edward  I partly on a Hill about Two Miles from the  Old  and the like Distance from  Rye  and partly in a little Valley where it had an Harbour but  Anno  the latter Part of this met with the same Fate as the former It never was comparable to the old Town having but three Parish Churches when it flourish'd and now there only remains the Chancel of one which is more than large enough for the Inhabitants But yet the Town was everywhere accommodated with fine stone arch'd Vaults for stowing of Merchandize and was laid out with admirable Regularity the Streets being divided into Quarters Some of the Stonework of the Three Gates are still to be seen The Sea is now above a Mile distant from it the Harbour being choaked up with Sands and Grass grows not only where the Harbour was but even in the Streets and indeed there are only a few Houses remaining in the upper Part of the Town Among the Ruins of the Walls to the S E are the Remains of a Castle as some say or of a Monastery as others will have it  Hastings  is the Chief of the Five Cinqueports and with its Two Members above was obliged to furnish the King with Twenty Ships for any Naval Expedition in Recompence for the ample Immuninities it enjoy'd as one of the Five Ports It is about Eight Miles from  Winchelsea  It consists of Two great Streets with a Parish Church in each and has several good Houses but its Harbour formerly so famous is now a poor Road for small Vessels having been ruined by the Storms that from time to time have been so fatal to its neighbouring Ports of  Rye  and  Winchelsea  We saw here the Ruins of an ancient Castle and about Three Miles off  Bullhide  Haven where  William the Conqueror  is said to have landed in his Invasion of  England  tho' some say it was at  Hastings  and others at  Pevensey  an Harbour more Westward which has likewise been destroy'd by the Sea but be that as it will it was at  Hastings  that he muster'd his Army after he had burnt his Ships being determin'd to conquer or perish in the Attempt or rather as another Author has observ'd that he might not be obliged to divide his Army which must have been the Case if he had preserv'd his Ships and probably while he made an Advance into the Country at the Head of part of his Army  Harold  might have stepp'd in between and cut off those who were left to guard the Ships and then with more Ease have attack'd and perhaps beat that Part commanded by the  Norman  himself  The decisive Battle which he fought  Anno  with King  Harold  was upon a Plain call'd  Heathfield  about Seven Miles from  Hastings  for an Account of which I shall refer to the Historians In the Place where  Harold  's Body was found the  Norman  instituted an Abbey of  Benedictine  Monks dedicating it to St  Martin  and from the Fight aforesaid it is called  BattleAbbey  and soon drew to it by a  Fair held every  Sunday  and Holiday such a Resort that it became a handsome Town It still retains the Name of  Battle  and some Remains of the Abbey are yet to be seen and make Part of the House of the Lord Viscount  Montacute  a Romancatholick Peer of which more in another Place  A little beyond  Hastings  to  Bourn  we ride upon the Sands in a strait Line for Eighteen Miles all upon the Coast of  Sussex  passing by  Pemsey  or  Pevensey  Haven aforementioned and the Mouth of the River which comes from  Battle  without so much as knowing that there was a River the Tide being out and all the Water sinking away in the Sands This Town of  Battle  is remarkable for little now but making the finest Gunpowder and the best perhaps in  Europe  Near  Battle  they shew us a Hill with a Beacon upon it now called  Beaconhill  but was formerly call'd  Standardhill  where the  Norman  set up his Great Standard of Defiance the Day before the decisive Battle with  Harold  and the  English    From the Beginning of  Romneymarsh  that is to say at  Sandgate  or  Sandfoot  Castle near  Hythe  to this Place the Country is a rich fertile Soil full of feeding Grounds and an incredible Number of large Sheep are fed every Year upon them and sent up to  London  Market These  Romneymarsh  Sheep are counted rather larger than the  Leicestershire  and  Lincolnshire  Sheep of which so much is said elsewhere  Besides the vast Flocks of Sheep as above abundance of large Bullocks are fed in this Part of the Country and especially those they call Stall'd or Housefed Oxen from their being kept within the Farmers Sheds or Yards all the latter Season where they are fed for the Wintermarket and generally deemed the largest Beef in  England    In  Romneymarsh  as in other Parts of  England  are found great Timbertrees lying at Length under Ground as black as Ebony and fit for Use when dried in the Sun  From hence it was that turning North and traversing the deep dirty but rich Part of these Two Counties my Curiosity led me to see the great Founderies or Ironworks which are in this County and where they are carried on at such a prodigious Expence of Wood that even in a Country almost all overrun with Timber they begin to complain of the great Consumption of it by those Furnaces and the Apprehension of leaving the next Age to want Timber for building their Navies I must own however that I conceived that Complaint was intirely groundless the Three Counties of  Kent Sussex  and  Hampshire  all which lie contiguous one to another being an inexhaustible Storehouse of Timber for this Purpose  After I had been fatigued in passing this deep and heavy Part of the Country I thought it would not be foreign to my Design if I refreshed myself with a View of  Tunbridgewells  which were not then above Miles out of my Way  When I came to the  Wells  which were Five Miles nearer to me than the Town supposing me then at  Battle  to the Southward of them I found a great deal of good Company there and particularly made an Observation that those People who have nothing to do anywhere else seem to be the busiest People at  Tunbridge    After the Appearance is over at the Wells where the Ladies are all in  Deshabile  and at the Chapel the Company go home and as if it was another Species of People or a Collection from another Place you are surprised to see the Walks covered with Ladies completely dressed and gay to Profusion  where rich Cloaths Jewels and Beauty dazzle the Eyes from one End of the Range to the other  As for Gaming Sharping Intriguing as also Fops Beaux and the like  Tunbridge  used to be as full of these as most other publick Places but the Act lately passed against Gaming has in a great measure cured this Evil Of this Act I shall say more when I come to  Bath    The Air here is excellent and the Provisions of all Sorts very reasonable particularly they are supplied with excellent Fish of almost all Sorts from  Rye  and other Towns on the Seacoast and I saw a Turbut of near twenty Pounds Weight sold there for Three Shillings In the Season of Mackarel they have them here from  Hastings  within three Hours of their being taken out of the Sea and the Difference which that makes in their Goodness I need not mention  They have likewise here abundance of Wildfowl of the best Sorts such as Pheasants Partridges Woodcocks Snipes Quails  c  particularly they have from the  Southdowns  the Bird called a  Wheatear  or which I think I may call the  English Ortolan  the most delicious Taste for one Mouthful for 'tis hardly more that can be imagined but these are very dear at  Tunbridge  they are much cheaper at  Seaford Lewes  and that Side of the Country  Tunbridge  is situated upon the little River  Tunn  which runs into the  Medway  hard by On the Southern Bank of the River are to be seen the Ruins of an old Castle built by a natural Son of  Richard  I Duke of  Normandy  who as Mr  Camden  tells us exchanged his Lordship of  Bryany  in that Duchy for  Tunbridge  The Church is a modern Building the Houses in the Town are mostly illbuilt and the Streets sorrily paved  The Wells are about Four Miles from the Town and the Rocks about Ten Miles from them and worth a Traveller's Curiosity to see as they are several prodigious Heaps of firm Stone Rocks tho' some Miles distant from the Sea  The Buildings at the Wells have much the Advantage of those in  Tunbridge  and may be said to constitute a large and populous Town themselves There is a Church or rather Chapel of Ease which is very neat This new Town as I may call it stands in a Bottom between Two Hills one of which is called  Mount Sion  and the other  Mount Ephraim  which are generally covered with good Houses fine Gardens and Fruittrees The Wells might be more properly called  Spelhurst Wells  for the Water rises in a Parish of that Name The Well which contains them is wellpaved like a Cistern and surrounded with a low Wall with a Pair of Stairs to go down The Company walk upon the Two abovenamed Hills after they have drank the Waters and divert themselves with Bowls Dancing or other Exercises as the Weather will permit and the Physicians prescribe Near the Well is a long Gallery paved and covered over wherein to walk in bad Weather and while they are taking the Waters and where likewise the Band of Musick have place There are also Rooms to drink Chocolate or Coffee and to play at Cards  c  likewise a Hall to dance in Not far off the Well is a Market well stored with Provisions of all Sorts  A very eminent Physician is of Opinion that the Waters of  Bath Tunbridge Chiltenham  or  Scarborough  which partake of the same Qualities and  Bristol  make the general Kinds of most of the various Mineral Waters on the Globe and that he therefore who understands these cannot be much at a Loss to determine the Virtues and Efficacy  of any new Kind And as this learned Gentleman has favoured me with his Opinion of these several Waters I shall communicate the same in their respective Places  And first this is what he says of the Nature Efficacy and Qualities of these of  Tunbridge    "  Tunbridge  Waters says he are nothing but an Impregnation of Rain or compressed Cloudwaters in some of the Eminencies of the neighbouring Country And indeed all Hills and conspicuous Elevations are mere hollow Nests of some Minerals Iron and Sulphur are the most common and universal Minerals and almost all Kinds of Stone fit for making Fences or Edifices have in their Composition one or both of them All the Varieties of hard black dark or greyish Stones abound with ferrugineous Particles and Iron is so necessary especially in Countries between the Tropicks and the Poles for Husbandry that there is scarce a Mile square within this Compass where it may not be found with its impregnated Waters This is demonstrable by the Action of the Loadstone on most Minerals the Magnet itself seeming to be scarce any thing but a purer Clod of Iron and pure polished Iron we know with very simple Management becomes highly magnetick Hence we account for the Frequency of chalybeat Mineral Waters of some Degree of Strength or other so readily to be found between the Poles and Tropicks And this is a bountiful Provision of Nature to those colder Climates where animal Food and fermented Liquors are so necessary for the Support Comfort and greater Proportion of animal Force required in them for their Defence from the Swarming of ravenous Animals and for hunting animal Food where the Vegetable is neither so proper nutritive nor abounding as in these  kindlier Climates between the Tropicks towards each Side of the Equator Mineral Chalybeat Waters brace the Solids which animal Food and fermented Liquors in any Plenty are apt to relax and wind up the Springs of animal Motion to keep the Blood fluid which the just mentioned Indulgencies are disposed to thicken Soft Stone Marl alkalious Clay and all Kinds of bituminous Earths have a larger Quantity of Sulphur in them for Sulphur Oil and Bitumen always leave Earth brittle spongy and alkalious Alkalies being only an harder earthy Sponge and when the watry Impregnations meet they naturally produce by Fermentation some Degree of Heat in the Mixture There is in Nature as this learned Gentleman thinks but one kind of Salt which is Nitre and that the Variety arises from a Mixture of Sulphur Earth or Iron in different Proportions combined in their Composition Nitre however and Seasalt have their principal Efficacy from the predominant Principle in their Texture and thus  Tunbridge  Waters are only a finer Solution of blue Vitriol or natural Salt of Steel or Rainwaters inimitable by Art in such salutary Effects as Nature always produces For Example Tho' Art may imitate in precious Stones all the Varieties of Colours Reflexions Refractions and Emissions of Light yet there is always some one peculiar Property as of Hardness Weight or Water which discovers the Sophistication In like manner all the Wines on the Globe may be so imitated that neither Eye nor Palate nor the Perception of their Effects on Animal Bodies can discover the Fiction and this without one Drop of the Juice of the Grape from the saccharine Quality only of almost all Fruits Seeds  or Herbs yet by analysing them in some proper Menstruum the Cheat may be found out Thus we may imitate all the several Mineral Waters on the Earth and pretty nearly conciliate all their general or grosser salutary Virtues on diseased Animals yet there is an unaccountable Something in the Taste Lightness on the Stomach Chearfulness and Alacrity they give which all our Skill can never bestow The Principle of Individuation the Size of their last and least Particles the Proportion of the several Parts of the Composition to the watry Menstruum and the due Time of their Impregnation are and ever will be unknown to us as will consequently the Degree required to wind up strengthen and contract the relaxed Solids of diseased human Bodies to such a Height that they may be enabled to grind dissolve and thin the concreted Juices as these active strong and invigorating Waters of  Tunbridge  usually do for in all robust Constitutions but partially depraved in the cold chronical Distempers of such Habits in nervous Disorders and low Spirits in weak Digestions and gross Habits they are extremely successful especially in the hotter Seasons of the Year"  Thus far this learned Gentleman  During the time I was at  Tunbridge  formerly I made an Excursion to  Knowlhouse  about Seven Miles from  Tunbridge  and One from  Sevenoak  belonging to the Duke of  Dorset  it is situated in the Middle of a Park and at that time was an antient Stone Fabrick but had nothing more remarkable in it than some excellent Pictures  I left  Tunbridge  and came to  Lewes  through the deepest dirtiest but in many respects the richest and most profitable Country in all that Part of  England    The Timber I saw here was prodigious as well for Size as Plenty and seemed in some Places suffered to grow only because it was so far off of any Navigation that it was not worth carrying away In dry Summers indeed a great deal is carried away to  Maidstone  and other Places on the  Medway  and sometimes I have seen one Tree on a Carriage which they call there a  Tug  drawn by Oxen and even then 'tis carried so little a Way being thrown down and left for other  Tugs  to take up and carry on that sometimes 'tis Two or Three Years before it gets to  Chatham  for if once the Rains begin it stirs no more that Year and sometimes a whole Summer is not dry enough to make the Roads passable  And here I shall observe according to my Promise  p  That in the Year an Act passed intituled  An Act to revive explain and amend an Act made in the    th and    th Years of the Reign of his late Majesty K  Charles II  intituled An Act for making the River of  Medway  navigable in the Counties of  Kent  and  Sussex And which when completed must be of very great Use to the Publick as well as to the Counties of  Kent  and  Sussex  in particular  The Preamble to this Act will set this Matter in a proper Light and it is to this Effect That the abovementioned Act of Parliament of the th and th of  Charles  II was never yet carried into Execution altho' the making the said River navigable was likely to be of great Utility to the Publick by reason of great Quantities of Timber growing on the  Wealds  of  Kent  and  Sussex  which is allowed to be the best in the Kingdom for the Use of the Royal Navy and which now thro' the Badness of the Roads in those Parts cannot be convey'd to any Market but at a large Expence  That therefore the present Undertakers being desirous to begin carry on and complete the Navigation  of such Part of the antient River  Medway  and Streams falling into it as run from  Forestrow  in  Sussex  to  Maidstone  in  Kent  this Act incorporates them for that Purpose by the Name of  The Company of Proprietors of the Navigation of the River  Medway  We must refer to the Act itself for farther Particulars and shall only observe That when this Work is completed it will be of inconceivable Advantage to the Publick not only for the excellent Timber which it will be a Means of conveying to proper Markets but for the easy and speedy Carriage of Iron Ordnance Balls and other Materials of War forged in or near the said River which at some times of the Year cannot be brought thro' the  Wealds  of the Two Counties and for the Carriage of Wood Corn Grain Hay Hops Wooll Leather and all manner of Provisions as also of Coals Lime Stone Wares and all other Necessaries and Commodities to the great Improvement of Trade and Commerce  A few Miles Northwest of  Tunbridge  lies  Sevenoak  so called from Seven large Oaks that grew near the Place It is a Markettown governed by a Warden and Assistants but is noted for nothing more than being a great Thoroughfare Town It has a good Hospital for maintaining and teaching poor Children erected by Sir  William Sevenoak  Lord Mayor of  London  who was a Foundling and took his Name from the Town  Lewes  is a pleasant Town large wellbuilt agreeably situated in the Middle of an open Champain Country and on the Edge of the  Southdowns  the most delightful of their Kind in the Nation it lies on the Bank of a little wholsome fresh River within Miles of the Sea and was formerly incompassed with a Wall but there are few Remains of it now to be seen But what contributes to the Advantage of this Town is that both it and  the Country adjacent are full of Gentlemen of good Families and Fortunes of which the  Pelhams  must be named with the first whose Chief is his Grace the Duke of  Newcastle  Here are also the antient Families of  Gage Shelly  c formerly Romancatholicks but now Protestants with many others  Lewes  has Five Churches in it Near it is an old demolish'd Castle in the Neighbourhood of which was fought that bloody Battle between King  Henry  III and his Barons the Event of which constrained the King to accept of hard Conditions of Peace and to give his Son as an Hostage for Performance  I ought not to forget that  Newhaven  in this Neighbourhood was formerly noted for its safe and good Harbour for Ships of considerable Burden but for want of a Provision for maintaining the Timber Piers which it had for Time immemorial it was quite neglected and the Harbour choaked up with Sand and Beach and the Piers were rotten and decay'd To remedy these Evils an Act passed  Anno  for Repairing and Keeping in Repair the said Piers and Harbour And when brought to Effect not only  Lewes  but the adjacent Parts as well as the whole Kingdom will be the better for it  From  Lewes  following still the Range of the  SouthDowns  West we ride in View of the Sea and on a fine Carpet Ground for about Miles to  Brighthelmston  a poor Fishingtown oldbuilt and on the very Shore of the Sea Hence again as I mentioned at  Folkstone  and  Dover  the Fishermen having large Barks go away to  Yarmouth  on the Coast of  Norfolk  to the Fishing Fair there and hire themselves out for the Season to catch Herrings for the Merchants and they tell us that these make a very good Business of it  The Sea is very unkind to  Brighthelmston  having by its continual Encroachments so gained upon  the Town that in a little time more the Inhabitants may reasonably expect it will eat away the whole Place above Houses having been devoured by the Water in a few Years past  From hence still keeping the Coast on the Left we come to  Shoreham  a Seafaring Town chiefly inhabited by Shipcarpenters Shipchandlers and all the several Trades depending upon the Building and Fitting up of Ships which is their chief Business They are indeed justly noted for good Sailors and for building neat and stout Seaboats which yet in Strength and Duration do not come up to those of  Yarmouth Ipswich  and the North  The Builders of Ships seem to have settled here chiefly because of the exceeding Quantity and Cheapness of Timber in the Country behind them being the same wooded Country I mentioned above which still continues thro' this County and the next The River this Town stands upon tho' not navigable for large Vessels yet serves to bring down this large Timber in Floats from  Bramber Steyning  and the Country adjacent which is in a manner all covered over with Timber  Here in the Compass of about Six Miles are Three Borough Towns sending Members to Parliament  viz Shoreham Bramber  and  Steyning Shoreham  and  Steyning  are pretty little Markettowns but  Bramber  after I have mentioned the Ruins of an old Castle hardly deserves the Name of a Town having not above Families in it and of them but few above asking Alms as you ride by The chief House in the Town when I was there was a Publickhouse the Landlord whereof boasted that upon an Election just then over he had made  l  of one Pipe of Canary  This is not the only Town in this County where the Elections have been scandalously mercenary insomuch that it has been said there was in one King's  Reign more Money spent at Elections than all the Lands in the Parishes were worth at Years Purchase I shall name in particular but one more and that is  Winchelsea  which is rather the Skeleton of an antient City than a real Town where the old Gates stand near Three Miles from one another over the Fields and the very Ruins are so buried that they have made good Corn Fields of the Streets and the Plough goes over the Foundations nay over the first Floors of the Houses and where nothing of a Town seems to remain yet at one Election for Members the Struggle was such between Sir  John Banks  and Colonel  Draper  a neighbouring Gentleman that I was assured the latter spent  l  and lost it too What the other spent who opposed him may be guessed at seeing he who spent most was always sure to carry it  Near  Steyning  the famous Baronet of the Name of  Fagg  hath an antient Seat And thence passing by the Seat of Sir  John Shelly  prettily situated in the Middle of a Grove we come to  Arundel  a decay'd Town also It stands near the Mouth of the River  Arun  which heretofore had a good Harbour called  Arundel Port  or the Harbour of  Little Hampton  capable of receiving Ships and Vessels of a considerable Burden but a Beach being thrown up by the Sea it was quite choaked up and the Navigation of the  Arun  obstructed so that the Harbour was rendered in a manner useless But in the Year an Act passed for erecting Piers in and for Repairing and Keeping in Repair the Harbour there by cutting a Chanel thro' the Beach and old Piers and erecting Locks  c  One great Advantage to the Country from this River is the Shipping off great Quantities of large Timber here which is carried up the  Thames  to  Woolwich  and  Deptford  and up the  Medway  to  Chatham  as also Westward to  Portsmouth  and even  to  Plymouth  to the new Dock there and indeed to all the King's Yards where the Business of the Navy is carried on The Timber shipped off here is esteemed the best and largest that is brought by Sea from any Part of  England  also great Quantities of Knee Timber are had here the largest of which is valuable in its kind above the strait Timber  This River and the old decay'd once famous Castle at  Arundel  which has the Privilege to give to its Possessor the Title of an Earl and Peer of the Realm without Creation and which belongs to the noble Family of  Howard  Earls of  Arundel  and Dukes of  Norfolk  is all that is remarkable here except it be that in the Church are Four old and stately Monuments of the Earls of  Arundel  and that in this River are catch'd the best and largest Mullets in  England  a Fish very good in itself and much valued by the Gentry round and often sent up to  London    From hence to the City of  Chichester  are of the most pleasant and beautiful Miles in  England  whether we go by the Hill or Downs or by the Plain or inclosed Country  To the North of  Arundel  and at the Bottom of the Hills and consequently in the  Weald  is the Town of  Petworth  a large handsome Country Markettown and very populous and as it stands upon an Ascent and is dry and healthy it is full of Gentlemens Families and good wellbuilt Houses both in the Town and Neighbourhood but the Beauty of  Petworth  is the antient Seat of the old Family of  Piercy  Earls of  Northumberland  now extinct whose Daughter the sole Heiress of all his vast Estates married  Charles Seymour  Duke of  Somerset  and among other noble Seats brought his Grace this of  Petworth    The Duke pull'd down the antient House and on the same Spot built from the Ground one of the  bestmodell'd Houses then in  Britain  it had the Misfortune to be once almost demolished by Fire but the Damage has been fully repaired  The Apartments are very noble well contrived and richly furnished but it cannot be said that the Situation of the House is chosen so happily as to boast of equal Judgment with the rest the Avenues to the Front want Space the House stands as it were with its Elbow to the Town its Front has no  Vista  answerable and the West Front look'd not to the Parks or fine Gardens but to the old Stables  To rectify this when it was too late to order it any other way the Duke was obliged to pull down those noble Buildings I mean the Meuse or Stables the finest of their kind in all the South of  England  and equal to some Noblemens whole Houses and yet even the demolishing the Pile has done no more than opened a Prospect over the Country whereas had the House been set on the rising Ground on the Side of the Park overagainst the North Wing of the House and a little more to the Westward the Front had been South to the Town the back Front to the Parks but now all these Advantages lie on one Angle or opposite to one Wing of the House Nevertheless it is a noble Pile of Building and by far the finest in all this Part of  Britain    From  Petworth  West the Country is a little less woody than the  Weald  and a great many fine Seats begin to shew their Heads above the Trees as the Duke of  Richmond  's Seat at  Godwood  near  Chichester  the Seats of the late Earl of  Tankerville  and the Earl of  Scarborough  and a great many others  But the Seat of the Right Honourable the Lord Visc  Montacute  called  Cowdrey  near  Midhurst  the  Midae  of the  Romans  deserves a particular Mention It is situated in a Valley encompassed with Lawns  Hills and Woods thrown into a Park the River running underneath which renders the Place very agreeable in Summer but makes it dampish in Winter The House is square and at each Corner is a  Gothick  Tower which have a very good Effect when viewed from the rising Grounds The Hall is ceiled with  Irish  Oak after the antient manner The Walls are painted with Architecture by  Roberti  the Statues by  Goupé  the Staircase by  Pelegrini  The large Parlour or Room at the End of the Hall is of  Holbein  's Painting where that great Artist has described the Exploits of King  Henry  VIII before  Boloigne Calais  his Landing at  Portsmouth  his magnificent Entry into  London  c In the other Rooms are many excellent Pictures of the Ancestors of the Family and other History Paintings of  Holbein  relating to their Actions in War The whole Circuit of Rooms are stately and wellfurnished adorned with many Pictures There is a long Gallery with the Twelve Apostles as big as the Life another very neat one wainscotted with  Norway  Oak where are many antient Wholelength Pictures of the Family in their proper Habits There are four Historypieces two Copies of  Raphael  's Marriage of  Cupid  and  Psyche  several old religious and military Paintings from  Battleabbey    The Park is very noble having a great Variety of Grounds in it and is well wooded with  Pines Firs  and other Evergreentrees which are grown to a large Size and here are some of the largest Chesnuttrees perhaps in  England  The Valleys which run thro' the Park are well supplied with Water which keeps the Grass in a constant Verdure  Chichester  is a neat and pretty large City walled round The River  Lavant  runs under Part of the Walls Two principal Streets cross it at right Angles upon the cardinal Points where stands a curious  Cross and Markethouse upon Pillars erected by Bishop  Read  The Church takes up one of these Quadrants It is remarkable for Two Sideisles on both Sides and the Pictures of all the Kings and Queens of  England  since  Cissa  the South  Saxon  Monarch who made this his Royal Seat and repaired the antient  Roman  Castle or Walls leaving his Name to the Place on the Southern Wall as on the opposite Wall all the Bishops The Spire is a Piece of excellent Workmanship but it received such a Shock some Years ago that it was almost miraculous that the Steeple did not fall down which if it had would probably have demolished the whole Church  It was what the Inhabitants call a Fireball or rather Lightning which broke upon the Steeple with such irresistible Force that it drove several great Stones out of it and carried them clear off to a prodigious Distance from the Steeple One of these Stones of at least a Ton Weight was blown over the South Side or Row of Houses in the West Street and fell on the Ground in the Street at a Gentleman's Door on the other Side of the Way and another of them almost as big was blown over both Sides of the said West Street into the same Gentleman's Garden and no Hurt done by either of them This Account I relate from a Person of undoubted Credit who was an Eyewitness and saw the Stones The Breach made thereby in the Spire tho' within about Feet of the Top was incredibly large and yet the Steeple stood fast and is now very substantially repaired which shews that it was originally an admirably sound and well finished Piece of Workmanship The Monuments of Bishop  Carleton  and Bishop  King  are in this Church whose Effigies are curiously done in Marble  In the Year in digging a Foundation at  Chichester  was found pretty deep in the Ground a  large Stone Six Feet long and Three broad with a  Roman  Inscription on it In digging up the Stone a few of the Letters were eras'd but they were easily supplied  Neptuno et Minervae Templum pro salute domus divinae ex auctoritate Tiberii Claudii Cogidubni regis legati Augusti in Britannia Collegium fabrorum et qui in eo a sacris vel honorati sunt de suo dedicaverunt donante aream Pudente Pudentini filio  That is    This Temple was dedicated to  Neptune  and  Minerva  for the Safety of the Imperial Family by the Authority of  Tiberius Claudius  It was erected by the College of Artificers of King  Cogidubnus Augustus  's Lieutenant in  Britain  and by those who officiated as Priests or were honoured in it at their own Expence the Ground being given by  Pudens  the Son of  Pudentinus    This Stone was presented to his Grace the Duke of  Richmond  who has placed it in a Temple on a Mount in his Garden at  Godwood  between two Statues of  Neptune  and  Minerva    This City is not a Place of much Trade nor is it very populous but within these few Years they are fallen into a new way of managing the Corn Trade here which turns very well to Account for whereas the Farmers generally speaking used to carry all their Wheat to  Farnham  Market which is very near Forty Miles by Landcarriage and from some Parts of the Country more than that some money'd Men of  Chichester Emsworth  and other Places adjacent join'd their Stocks together and built large Granaries near the  Crook  where the Vessels come up and here they buy and lay up all  the Corn which the Country on that Side can spare and having good Mills in the Neighbourhood they grind and dress the Corn and send it to  London  in the Meal by long Sea  This is a great lessening to  Farnham  Market but if the Market at  London  is supply'd the coming by Sea from  Chichester  is every whit as much a publick Good as the encouraging of  Farnham  Market which is of itself the greatest Cornmarket in  England Hempstead  in  Hertfordshire  and  London  excepted This carrying of Meal by Sea is now practised from several other Places on this Coast even as far as  Southampton    Chichester  besides the Cathedral has Five small Churches About Three Miles from it is a House of his Grace the Duke of  Richmond  called  Godwood  It was the antient Seat of the Earls of  Northumberland  and in a very ruinous Condition but the Duke of  Richmond  has lately built some Offices which are to correspond with a Mansionhouse design'd by  Colin Campbel  and publish'd by him in his  Vitruvius Britannicus    His Grace has a noble  Menagerie  where he keeps a great Variety of foreign Animals and Birds but the Park is small and illplanted  However it has an easy Descent to the East South and Southwest with the Prospect of a rich and beautiful Landskip bounded by the Sea for Thirty Miles in Length The  Isle of Wight  terminates the Southwest Prospect and the famous  St Rookshill  covers it from the North  About Three Miles to the East of  Godwood  lies  Charlton  a small Village remarkable for being the Seat of Foxhunters here are many small Huntinghouses built by Persons of Quality who reside there during the Season for Foxhunting but the most beautiful of these Buildings is that of his Grace the Duke of  Richmond    Here is also a large Room which was design'd by the Right Hon the Earl of  Burlington  where the Gentlemen Foxhunters dine every Day together during their Stay at the Village  By the Side of this Village is a Forest which was formerly in the Possession of the  Lumlies  but has been for some Years his Grace the Duke of  Richmond  's who has greatly beautified it by cutting fine Ridings thro' the several Parts of it and making many new Plantations therein  From  Chichester  the Road lying still West we pass in Sight of the Earl of  Scarborough  's fine Seat at  Stansted  a House surrounded with thick Woods thro' which there are the most agreeable Vista's cut that are to be seen anywhere in  England  and particularly at the West Opening which is from the Front of the House they sit in the Dineingroom and see the Town and Harbour of  Portsmouth  the Ships at  Spithead  and also at  St Helen  's which when the Royal Navy happens to be there is a most glorious Sight  In our Passage to  Portsmouth  we pass'd by  Fareham  and by  Portchester  a Castle built out of a  Roman  City  In  Portsmouth  Haven a Thousand Sail of the biggest Ships may ride secure The Mouth is not so broad as the  Thames  at  Westminster  and that secur'd on  Gosport  Side by  Charles  Fort  James  Fort  Borough  Fort and  Blockhouse  Fort which has a Platform of above great Guns level with the Water On the other Side by  Portsmouth  stands  Southsea  Castle built by King  Henry  VIII The Government has within these few Years bought more Ground for additional Works and no doubt it may be made impregnable for a shallow Water may be brought quite round it The Yards the Docks the Storehouses where all the Furniture is laid up  in the exactest Order so that the Workmen can find any Implement in the Dark exceed Imagination as do the immense Quantities of all sorts of military and naval Stores The Ropehouse is Feet long one continued Room almost a Quarter of a Mile I had the Pleasure of seeing a great Cable made here it requires Men to work at it and so hard is the Labour that they can work but Four Hours in the Day The smallest Number of Men continually employed in the Yard is and that but barely sufficient  Here is also a good Counterscarp and double Mote with Ravelins in the Ditch and double Palisadoes and advanc'd Works to cover the Place from any Approach where it may be practicable The Strength of the Town is also considerably augmented on the Landside by the Fortifications raised of late Years about the Docks and Yards and those Parts made a particular Strength by themselves and tho' they are indeed in some Sense independent one of another yet they cover and strengthen one another so that they cannot be separately attack'd on that Side while they are both in the same Hands  Edw  IV began these Fortifications  Henry  VII considerably augmented them  Charles  II much improv'd them and King  James  II greatly added to them I was sorry to leave this amazing Scene of naval Grandeur for the Sight of a wretched Statue of King  William  III gilt indeed in an extraordinary manner but the very worst of all the bad Works of this kind I have yet seen I observ'd the great Quantity of Water and Ditches hereabout is apt to render the Place aguish  These Docks and Yards are now like a Town by themselves and are a kind of Marine Corporation within themselves there being particular large Rows of Dwellings built at the publick Charge within the new Works for all the principal Officers of the  Place especially the Commissioner the Agent of the Victualling and suchlike  The Town of  Portsmouth  is a well inhabited thriving Corporation and hath been greatly enriched of late by the Fleet's having so often and so long lain there as well as large Fleets of Merchantmen besides the constant fitting out of Men of War here and the often paying them at  Portsmouth  has made a great Resort of People to it Mr  Camden  so long ago as the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  takes notice that  Portsmouth was populous in time of War but not so in time of Peace  but now the Business of the Navy is so much increased and so much of it always done here that it may be said that there is more to do at  Portsmouth  now in time of Peace than was then in time of War  The Government of the Place is by a Mayor and Aldermen  c  and the Civil Government is no more interrupted by the Military than if there was no Garison there so that we have very seldom had any Complaint either of Want of Discipline among the Soldiers or Want of Prudence in the Magistrates  Since the Increase of Business at this Place the Confluence of People has been so great that the Town not admitting any Inlargement for Buildings a kind of Suburb or rather a new Town has been built on the heathy Ground adjoining which is so considerable that it threatens to outdo for Numbers of Inhabitants and Beauty of Buildings even the Town itself and the rather as it is unconfin'd by the Laws of the Garison and unincumber'd with the Corporation Burdens Freedoms Townduties Services and the like  Next we arriv'd at the  Portsdown  Hills which are of Chalk and at a reasonable Distance from the Shore extend themselves into  Sussex    Here we turn'd to admire the Face of the Ground we had pass'd The Ports Creeks Bays Ocean  Castles and Ships the  Isle of Wight Portchester  the considerable Town of  Gosport Portsmouth Southampton Chichester  and all the Coast from  Portland  Isle to  Sussex  were comprehended under one View  From  Portsmouth  West the Country lies low and flat is full of Creeks and Inlets of the Sea and Rivers all the Way to  Southampton  so that we ferry over three times in about Miles besides going over the Bridge at  Tichfield  The first of these Ferries is at  Portsmouth  itself  viz  cross the Mouth of the Harbour from the  Point  abovemention'd to  Gosport  a large Town and of great Trade especially in time of War From thence we ride to  Tichfield  as above where we pass the River  Alre  which rises in the same County at  Alresford  or near it which is not above Twentytwo Miles off and yet it is a large River here and makes a good Road below call'd  Tichfieldbay  Thence at about Four Miles we pass another River at  Busselton  narrow in Breadth but exceeding deep and eminent for its being able to carry the largest Ships here is a Buildingyard for Ships of War and in King  William  's Time Two Eightygun Ships were launch'd here It seems the Safety of the Creek and the Plenty of Timber in the Country behind it is the Reason of Building so much in this Place  From hence when we come opposite to  Southampton  we pass another Creek being the Mouth of the River  Alre  which comes down from  Winchester  and is both very broad and deep and the Ferrymen having a very sorry Boat we found it dangerous enough passing it On the opposite Bank stands the antient Town of  Southampton  on the other Side of which comes down another large River called the  Test  entring  Southampton  Water by  Redbridge  so that the Town of  Southampton  stands upon a Point running out into the Sea between Two very fine Rivers both navigable for some Way up the Country  and particularly useful for the bringing down Timber out of one of the best wooded Counties in  Britain  for the River on the Westside of the Town comes by the Edge of  Newforest  here we saw a prodigious Quantity of Timber of an uncommon Size vastly large lying on the Shore of the River for above Two Miles in Length which they told us was brought thither from the Forest and left there to be fetch'd by the Builders at  Portsmouthdock  as they had Occasion for it  In riding over the South Part of  Hampshire  I made this Observation That notwithstanding the very great Consumption of Timber since the Revolution by Building or Rebuilding almost the whole Navy and notwithstanding so many of the King's Ships were built hereabouts besides abundance of large Merchantships which were about that time built at  Southampton  at  Redbridge  and at  Busselton c  yet I saw the Gentlemens Estates within Six Eight or Ten Miles of  Southampton  so overgrown with Wood and their Woods so full of large wellgrown Timber that it seem'd as if they wanted Sale for it and that it was of little Worth to them In one Estate at  Hurseley  in particular near  Winchester  formerly belonging to Mr  Cromwell  Grandson to  Oliver Cromwell  tho' the whole Estate was not above  l per Ann  in Rent they might have cut Twenty thousand Pounds worth of Timber down and yet have left the Woods in a thriving Condition in another Estate between that and  Petersfield  of about  l per Ann  they told me they could fell a Thousand Pounds a Year in good large Timber fit for Building for Twenty Years together and do the Woods no Harm The late Colonel  Norton  also whose Seat at  Southwick  was within Six Miles of  Portsmouth  and within Three of the Watercarriage had as I was told at that time an immense Quantity of Timber upon it some growing  within Sight of the very Docks in  Portsmouth  Farther West it is all the same and as I rode thro'  Newforest  I saw the antient Oaks of many hundred Years standing grown white with Age and perishing with their wither'd Tops in the Air  I shall give other Hints of the like when I come to speak of  Hertfordshire Buckinghamshire Berkshire  and the Counties which we call Inland where the Timber is but of small Value for want of Watercarriage to bring it away likewise again of the Counties Northward bordering upon the  Humber  and upon all the Northern Rivers not to say a Word of  Ireland  which is still a Storehouse of Timber more inexhaustible if possible than  England    But having mention'd the late Col  Norton  we cannot pass over in Silence his extraordinary Will which made so much Noise in the World  This Gentleman dy'd in  Dec  and left his Real Estate of about  l per Ann  and a Personal said to be to the Value of  l  to the  "Poor Hungry and Thirsty Naked and Strangers Sick and Wounded and Prisoners to the End of the World"  And appointed the Parliament of  Great Britain  to be his Executors and in case of their Refusal the Bishops and left his Pictures and other Valuables to the King But his Will has been since set aside on the score of Insanity strong Marks of which it carry'd in the Face of it  This Gentleman was famous for acting several Parts in Plays with great Propriety particularly the Part of  Falstaff  in  Shakespear  's  Henry the Fourth  and the  Merry Wives of Windsor  at a neat Theatre erected by himself at his House at  Southwick  to which in a Vacation he often drew down and entertain'd the most celebrated  London  Actors  This Gentleman's Seat at  Southwick  was formerly an old Monastery and many of the Walls of it are yet remaining the House being a Part of it the Situation  is very low and wet having a great deal of boggy Ground about it but from the House the Park rises to the highest Point of  Portsdown  mention'd above where there are two very large Clumps of  Scots  Firtrees which were planted by the late Col  Norton  and have thriven so well tho' greatly exposed to the Sea Winds as to become a Landmark at a considerable Distance at Sea and may be seen near Twenty Miles at Land Between these two Clumps of Trees I was informed that Gentleman intended to have erected a lofty Building which must have had an exceeding good Effect for from the level Ground on this Spot you have a full View of  Portsmouth  Town Harbour and Docks under the Eye and  St Helen  's in the  Isle of Wight  is another Point of View with an unbounded Prospect of the Sea to the Southeast and on the Landside a large extensive Vale well planted and cultivated bounded with Hills spread with Woods and the  South downs  covered with Sheep just under the Eye so that this Prospect may be justly esteemed one of the finest in  England    Southampton  is a truly antient Town which having been many Years decaying in its Trade of late has very much improv'd in that of  Portugal  Wines which are imported here and sent into many Places inland where formerly the  London  Merchants used to deal and that in great measure owing to the Duties being easier at  Southampton  than at  London  They also carry on some Trade with the Isles of  Jersey  and  Guernsey  and not a little as their Enemies say of the Smuggling Trade The Town is large and populous has a fair Highstreet a spacious Key and if its Trade should thoroughly revive is able to contain great Numbers of People There is a  French  Church and no inconsiderable Congregation belonging to it Here are still some Merchants who trade to  Newfoundland  for Fish which they carry to  the  Streights  c and some Shipbuilding also is carried on here tho' not near so much as formerly  This Town had formerly the sole Privilege from the Crown of importing Wines from thence which tho' a vast Advantage to it the Corporation either wantonly or corruptly sold to  London    The Situation of  Southampton  between two Rivers was to its Advantage formerly in point of Strength and is besides strongly wall'd with very large Stones full of those little white Shells like Honeycombs which grow upon the Back of Oysters This is a sort of Stone extremely hard and seems to be gather'd near the Beach of the Sea These Walls have many Lunets and Towers in some Places double ditch'd but the Sea encompasses near half the Town It was built in the Reign of  Edward  III  I observe they have a Method of breaking the Force of the Waves here by laying a Bank of  Seaore  as they call it It is composed of long slender and strong Filaments like pill'd Hemp very tough and durable I suppose thrown up by the Sea and this performs its Work better than Walls of Stone or natural Cliff  At the Southeast Corner near the Quay is a Fort with some Guns upon it call'd the  Tower  On one was an Inscription denoting its being erected by King  Henry  VIII in the Year In the Northwest Corner was a strong Castle with a Mount wall'd about attop as a Keep upon this a round Stone Tower with a winding Ascent  The Main of this Town consists of one broad Street running thro' its Length There are many old religious Ruins and great Warehouses Cellars Storehouses  c  The old  Roman  City call'd  Trausantum  stood more Eastward upon the Banks of the River  Itching  coming from  Winchester  where now is a Hamlet nam'd  St Mary  's There is a handsome new Church built upon the Ruins of an old one  which they say was burnt in some  French  Wars It is near the present Ferry and opposite to  Bittern  where was an old  Roman  Castle surrounded with a Ditch into which the Seawater flow'd It was ruin'd in the  Danish  Wars and  Southampton  arose from its Ashes This Place is memorable for the Experiment of King  Canute  who to silence the vain Flattery of his Courtiers seated himself on the Banks of the River with all his Regal Apparatus and commanded the Tide not to approach his Footstool  About a Mile from this Town on the Banks of the River  Itching  is a vast large Pile of Earth which rises in the Form of a Cone from a large wide Foundation of great Extent and Circumference which they call  BevisMount  It is supposed to be an antient Fortification thrown up by the  Saxons  under the Command of  Bevis  to oppose the Passage of the  Danes  over the River who lay encamp'd on the other Side The River is not very large but the Tide running up into it a good Way beyond the Town forms a kind of Bay just under this great Mount which being contiguous to an Estate belonging to the late Earl of  Peterborough  his Lordship purchased it and converted it into a kind of Wilderness and as it is full of Trees and Brambles he has cut through them divers circular Walks and Labyrinths so very intricate that it is hardly possible to avoid being lost in them His Lordship used frequently to divert himself by dropping his Friends in the midst of this Wilderness and stealing away let them wander up and down till they found their Way out of it The Mount terminates above as is feign'd of  Parnassus  in a kind of Fork and between the two Spires is a Bowlinggreen or Parterre adorn'd with fine  Italian  Marble Statues brought by his Lordship from abroad It lies open on the Sidefacing the River and when the Tide is in gives a most agreeable Prospect On one Side of this Parterre declining gradually from the  Top of one of the Spires to the Green is planted a little Vineyard exposed to the South and on the other Side on the very Summit of the Spire stands a fine Summerhouse very elegantly built and contrived with a good Cellar under it where his Lordship kept his Wines having no good Cellerage at his House which is near a quarter of a Mile from the Mount from which his Lordship called it  BevisMount  He intended to rebuild the House and convert all the Grounds lying between it and the Mount into Gardens had he lived a little longer The Beauty of the Improvements which his Lordship has made in this Mount are hardly to be conceived He has adorn'd it with Statues Grottoes and Alcoves and diversify'd it up and down with something new and surprising at every turn peculiar to his own fine Taste and Genius in Gardening wherein no Nobleman excell'd and few equall'd him in  Europe  He left this little Seat and Lands about it to his Lady who now enjoys them  There are as many things fabled here of  Bevis  as there are in  Wales  and  Cornwall  of King  Arthur  both of whom have suffer'd much from Legendary Writers and Tradition for as King  Arthur  perform'd many brave and valiant Acts in War and was of great bodily Strength so  Bevis  who was a  Saxon  Lord was a Man of much military Courage and Conduct as well as personally strong He was a great Opposer of the  Normans  and followed them down to  Wales  and gave them Battle near  Caerdiff  in  Glamorganshire  but was there defeated 'Tis said his Sword may be still seen at  Arundel  Castle yet there are some who from the Fables with which their Stories are mingled doubt whether ever there were such Persons as either of them  I here took a Passage over to the  Isle of Wight  and in Two Hours arriv'd at  Cowes  by the Way passing by  Calshot  Castle where some Years ago were to be  seen the Maintopmast Head of a  Dutch  Man of War sunk in that Place a very dangerous Sand lying there in the middle of the Current  Cowes  is the chief Seaport Town in this Island and in Time of War the general Place of Rendezvous for Merchantships waiting for Convoys being secur'd in some measure by the Guns of the Castle but more by the Neighbourhood of  Portsmouth  We walked Four Miles and came to  Newport  the principal Town in the Island large and populous At a pretty strong Castle about a Mile distant resides the Governor  The Island is very pleasant and so fruitful that one Year's Crop will serve the Inhabitants for Seven Years who therefore supply  Portsmouth  and the Parts adjacent with the Surplus It abounds particularly in Corn Cattle Hares Rabbets Wildfowl Fish  c  It is Sixty Miles in Circumference its Militia is the best disciplined in  England  Its Wool in Fineness is next to that of  Cotswold Carisbrook  Castle is famous for being the Place of Imprisonment of King  Charles  I  Sanham  in this Island has also a Castle so has  SouthYarmouth  so called to distinguish it from  GreatYarmouth  in  Norfolk Spithead  between  Portsmouth  and this Island and  St Helen  's near to the  Isle of Wight  are famous for the Rendezvous of the Royal Navy of  England Appledorecome  is a very beautiful Seat in this Isle belonging to Sir  Robert Worsley  B  rt  This Island is also noted for having been once advanced to the Title of a Kingdom by King  Henry  VI in behalf of  Henry Beauchamp  Earl of  Warwick  his great Favourite who was crown'd King of  Wight  and of the Isles of  Jersey  and  Guernsey  in but dying Two Years after the Isle lost the Title of a Kingdom For King  Edward  IV who succeeded  Henry  bestow'd this Island upon his Fatherinlaw  Richard Woodville  Earl  Rivers    with the Title of  Lord of Wight  as the late Earl of  Derby  was Lord of the  Isle of Man    Returning to  Southampton  I was at the Extent of my intended Journey West intending to look no farther this Way for the present I went Northeast leaving  Winchester  a little on the Left and came into the  Portsmouth  Road at  Petersfield  a Town chiefly noted for good Inns and standing in the Middle of a Country overgrown with a prodigious Quantity of Oaktimber From hence we came to  Alton  and in the Road thither began a little to taste the Pleasure of the Western Downs which reach from  Winchester  almost to that Place  The Duke of  Bolton  has Two very noble Seats in this Country one between  Alton  and  Alresford  and one at  Basing  of which hereafter  Alton  is a small Markettown of no Note neither is there any considerable Manufacture in all this Part of  England  except a little Drugget and Shalloonmaking otherwise the whole Counties of  Kent Sussex Surrey  and  Hampshire  are not employ'd in any considerable Woollen Manufacture  From  Alton  we came to  Farnham  a large populous Markettown the farthest that Way in the County of  Surrey  from  London  and excepting  Hempstead  and  London  as we observ'd above the greatest Cornmarket in  England  particularly for Wheat of which so vast a Quantity is brought hither every Marketday that a Gentleman told me he once counted Teams of Horse all drawing Waggons or Carts loaden with Wheat every Team of which is supposed to bring a Load which is Forty Bushels in the whole Bushels but I do not take upon me to affirm this for Truth of my own Knowledge tho' I know some have thought the Quantity has been much more but this also was I suppose before the People of  Chichester  and  Emsworth  on one Side  and  Southampton Tichfield  and  Redbridge  on the other took to the Trade of sending their Wheat in Meal to  London  by Sea as I mentioned before  The Tolldish some Marketdays used to amount to above a Load of Wheat and yet about Years ago it was so short of it that one  Busk  whose Property it was sold it for Forty Shillings so greatly was this Manufacture increased within that Period But if  Farnham  has been a Loser by the Method lately fallen upon by the People of  Chichester  and  Southampton  it has made itself amends by another Product which it has taken to within these Twenty Years past and that is Hops which it has so vastly improved in that it may be said to outdo  Canterbury Maidstone  and any of the Places in  Kent  most noted for that Commodity and this not only in Quantity but Goodness In short all the Neighbourhood about  Farnham  is one general Hopground and to shew the Excellency of the Product  Farnham  Hops now lead the Price at all the Markets in  England    At this Town is a Castle built by a Bishop of  Winchester  which has been in a constant Succession possessed by the Bishops of the Diocese ever since King  Stephen  's Time to this Day and is their usual Place of Residence This Palace is a magnificent Structure deeply moated and strongly wall'd with Towers at proper Distances It stands upon the Edge of an Hill where is a fine Park One large and broad Street of the Town belowhill fronts the Castle The Main of the rest of the Town consists of a long strait Street crossing it at right Angles The River went parallel to it on the South  About Two Miles from  Farnham  is  Morepark  formerly the Seat of Sir  William Temple  who by his Will ordered his Heart to be put into a Chinabason and buried under a Sundial in his Garden which was accordingly perform'd This House is  situated in a Valley surrounded on every Side with Hills having a running Stream thro' the Gardens which with a small Expence might be made to serpent thro' all the adjoining Meadows in a most delightful manner At about a Quarter of a Mile from the House is a large Grotto in the Side of a Hill from whence you may command a Prospect of the Meadows and Woods which lie below it and these are bounded again by Hills which makes the whole one of the most romantick Places imaginable  From  Farnham  that I might take in the whole County of  Surrey  I took the Coach Road over  Bagshotheath  and that great Forest as it is call'd of  Windsor    Bagshotheath  which at present is a horrid barren Country is capable of great Improvement as may be judg'd by the several Inclosures on the Borders of it and some in the Centre also which from being in the same Condition as we at present see the whole Face of the Country thereabouts very barren producing nothing but Heath and Whorts now produces good Corn and Grass and in some Parts are good Plantations of Trees which thrive well On the Edge of this Heath are several Seats of Noblemen but those which require Notice are first the Right Hon the Earl of  Arran  's which is a large Inclosure the Woodwalks and other Plantations being upward of Two Miles in Circumference and the Park which runs on the other Side of the House is upward of Three Miles The Plantations in this Inclosure have made good Progress which is a Proof that the Soil thereabout is capable of great Improvement  The next Seat is that of the Right Hon the Earl of  Anglesea  which is an antient House situated very near the Church and almost surrounded with large Trees so that only the Front appears to View  The Duke of  Roxborough  has also a Seat in this Place where his Grace used to reside a great Part of the Summer and Autumn for the Pleasure of Shooting being very fond of that Sport  This Desert lies extended so much that some say there is not less than Acres of this barren Land that lies all together reaching out every Way in the Three Counties of  Surrey Hampshire  and  Berkshire  besides a great Quantity of Land almost as bad as that between  Godalmin  and  Petersfield  on the Road to  Portsmouth  including some Hills call'd the  Hindhead  and others  It may not be amiss to take notice of a common Mistake in relation to  Bagshot  Mutton so much valued by the Gentry which they suppose to be fed there and from the Poorness of the Soil render'd smaller than most other Mutton in  England  whereas I am credibly inform'd that none of the Sheep are fed at  Bagshot  being brought from and fed upon  Hampshire  Downs and all kill'd by the Butchers of  Bagshot  and sent to  London    Thro' this Desert for I can call it no less we come into the great Western Road leading from  London  to  Salisbury Exeter  c and pass the  Thames  at  Stanes    The Bridge of  Stanes  and  Egham  Causeway which are part of the Highway from  London  to the West of  England  having been for some time in a ruinous and dangerous Condition and the Tolls and Duties laid by an Act passed in the Reign of  Henry  VIII and another in that of Queen  Elizabeth  amounting to no more than the clear Sum of  l per Annum  the Bridgemasters were obliged to exact at the Ferry there exorbitant Rates for conveying Passengers over the  Thames  in order the better to support the said Bridge and Causeway and yet all proving insufficient as well as burdensome an Act passed in the Session of for the more  effectual Maintenance and wellkeeping of them both and will be a great Benefit to Passengers as also to the River and the Towns adjacent and the Act provides that in case of the Reparation of the Bridge or any other Accident which shall hinder Passengers or Carriages going over the Bridge the Ferry shall exact no higher Rate for conveying over such Passengers  c  than are laid for passing over the Bridge  Here recollecting that I had yet left the Inland Towns of the Two Counties of  Kent  and  Sussex  and great Part of the County of  Surrey  out of my Account and that having as it were taken a Circuit round the Coast only I had a great many Places worth viewing to give an Account of I therefore left  Windsor  on one Side of the River and  HamptonCourt  on the other to be the Subject of another Letter and resolv'd to finish my present Purpose in the Order I had begun it that is to say to take in the whole Country as I came on that I might make as few Transitions as possible from one remote Part of  England  to another  From  Stanes  therefore I turn'd S and S E to  Chertsey  another Markettown and where there is a Bridge over the  Thames  this Town is noted for the Burialplace of  Henry  VI whence his Bones were afterwards removed to  Windsor  by  Henry  VII and also by its being the Retreat of the incomparable  Cowley  where he lived distant from the Hurries of the Court and Town intirely taken up in Country Business Farming and Husbandry for his Diversion and where he also dy'd  From this Town wholly employ'd in Malting and in Barge Carriages down the River to  London  I went away South to  Working  a private Country Markettown so out of the Way that 'tis very little heard of in  England  It claims however some Honour from its being once the Residence of a  Royal Branch of the Family of  Plantagenet  the old Countess of  Richmond  Mother to King  Henry  VII who made her last Retreat here where the King her Son built or rather repair'd an old Royal House on purpose for her Residence and where she ended her Days in Honour and Peace the former Part of her Life having been much exposed to Storms and Dangers under the turbulent Reigns of the Two preceding Monarchs  From hence we came to  Guilford  a well known and considerable Markettown Here sometimes the Assizes are held but always Elections for Parliament Men for the County The River which according to Mr  Camden  is called the  Wey  and which falls into the  Thames  at  Oatlands  is made navigable to this Town which adds greatly to its Trade and by this Navigation a very great Quantity of Timber is brought down to  London  not from the Neighbourhood of this Town only but even from the woody Parts of  Sussex  and  Hampshire  above Thirty Miles from it the Country Carriages bringing it hither in the Summer by Land This Navigation is also a great Support to the Cornmarket at  Farnham  for as the Mealmen and other Dealers buy the Corn at that Market a good deal of it is brought to the Mills on this River which is not above Seven Miles distant and being first ground and dress'd is then sent down in the Meal by Barges to  London  at a small Expence  Here is a small Remainder of an old Manufacture in the Clothingtrade and it extends itself to  Godalmin Haselmere  and the Vale Country on the Side of the  Holmwood  of which I shall speak on another Occasion quite to  Darking  These Cloths of a middling Price have formerly been in great Repute but afterwards lost their Credit for some time till by the Application and Skill of the Clothiers of late they revived whilst the Clothiers of  Cranbrook  and  Tenterden  in  Kent  whose Goods are of the same Kind are almost sunk to nothing as I have already observed  This Clothingtrade however small is yet very assisting to the Poor of this Part of the Country where the Lands as I have noted are but indifferent the Inhabitants generally Cottagers living chiefly by the Commons and Heath Ground thereabouts  On  Wednesday  the d of  April  the Upper Church at  Guilford  in  Surrey  fell down It was an antient Building and not long before  l  was expended upon it in Repairs there was Preaching in it on the  Sunday  before and Workmen were employ'd in taking down the Bells who providentially had quitted the Spot about a Quarter of an Hour before the Accident happened so that not one Person received any Hurt tho' great Numbers were Spectators Three Bells had been taken down and the other Three fell with the Steeple which broke the Body of the Church to Pieces tho' the Steeple received but little Damage by the Fall  From  Guilford  the Road to  Farnham  is very remarkable for it runs along West from  Guilford  upon the Ridge of a high chalky Hill no wider than the Road itself and the Declivity begins on either hand at the very Hedge that bounds the Highway and is very steep and high From this Hill is a Prospect either way so far that 'tis surprising insomuch that one sees to the North or Northwest over  Bagshotheath  one way to the Southeast into  Sussex  the other way almost to the  Southdowns  and West to an unbounded Length where the Horizon only restrains the Eye This Hill being all Chalk a Traveller feels the Effect of it in a hot Summer's Day when the Reflection of the Sun make the Heat almost insupportable This Hill reaches from  Guilford  so far as within a Mile and a half of  Farnham    The Hill or rather the Ascent of it from  Guilford  is called  St Catharine'shill  on the Summit whereof stands the Gallows which is so placed that the Townspeople from the  Highstreet  may sit at their Shopdoors and see the Criminals executed  Near  Guilford  on the Lefthand Side of the Road leading to  Godalmin  are the Remains of an antient Chapel situated on the Summit of a Hill so as to be seen at a considerable Distance every way This is called  St Catharine's  Chapel The Materials with which this was built are a sort of Tile which when broken has the Appearance of Iron within and the Cement which joins these Titles is now so hard as scarcely to be penetrated with the strongest Instrument The only Remains of this Chapel are the outside Walls which being built with these Materials have resisted the Weather and the common Fate of Things  The great Road from  London  to  Chichester  and from  London  to  Portsmouth  lying thro'  Guilford  it is consequently a Town very well furnished with Inns for Accommodation of Travellers as is  Godalmin  also the next Town within Three Miles of it noted likewise of late Years for the Place of Residence of the Impostor  Mary Tofts  who so long amused Statesmen Physicians Anatomists and in short all Degrees of Men learned and unlearned with her infamous Rabbetproductions  c  From  Guilford  lies a Crossroad as it may be called to  London  not frequented by Coaches or Carriers or the ordinary Passengers to  London  tho' 'tis by some reckoned the nearest Way and is without Question much the pleasanter Road if not the pleasantest in this Part of  England viz  From this Town to  Leatherhead  Miles from  Leatherhead  to  London  over  Bansteaddowns  Miles or if you please by  Epsom  Miles which tho'  it is called the farthest Way makes Amends abundantly by the Advantage and Pleasantness of the Road  In the Road from  Guilford  to  Epsom  being Miles you meet with a Town almost at every Two Miles End in or near which is a handsome Seat The Road is always good being a very hard Gravel On the Righthand of the Road lie the  Downs  which have constantly a great Number of Sheep feeding on them and on the Left the Parks Gardens and cultivated Fields belonging to the several Gentlemen who inhabit those Seats all which render the Road very pleasant and agreeable  The Seat of the Lord  Onslow  which is the first on the Road from  Guilford  is but indifferently situated the Front which faces the Road is obscured by the Wood so that it can be seen only in one Point of View and the House standing very low does not command any Prospect from the neighbouring  Downs  the Avenues to it are very narrow and the Building tho' very large is executed in a very bad Taste  On the same Road lies an antient Seat now in the Possession of  James Fox    Esq  which tho' an old Building yet having an open Situation in Front toward the  Downs  is rendered very pleasant and the present Possessor being a Person of fine Taste is beautifying the House within and making pleasant Plantations about it which will be a great Embellishment to the Seat  Near this Road also lies the Seat of the Honourable Sir  Conyers Darcy  which is situated on an Eminence so as to be seen many Miles distant The House is a large new Edifice having a Park behind it and is pretty well timbered on every Side I ought not to omit mentioning the Seat of the late  Arthur Moore    Esq  at  Fetcham  near  Leatherhead  now in the Possession of  Thomas Revel    Esq  where no  Cost has been spared to make a most beautiful Situation by Nature more delightful by Art  Two Miles from  Guilford  on the Banks of the  Wey  is a fine Seat which belonged when I saw it to the late  Denzil Onslow    Esq  called  Pyrford  and is exceeding pleasant especially for the beautiful Intermixture of Wood and Water in the Park Gardens and Grounds adjoining whereby that Gentleman whose Genius lay wonderfully in improving Lands and rendering Things more profitable and pleasant brought  Pyrford  to such a Perfection as to be inferior to very few if any of the finest Houses in  Surrey  Adjoining to the Park is a very convenient and ingenious Decoy the first of the Kind in this Part of  England    At the Northeast End of this Range of fine Seats is  Leatherhead  a little Thoroughfaretown with a Stone Bridge over the  Mole  a River so called from its remarkable Sinking into the Earth at the Foot of  Boxhill  near a Village called  Mickleham  and working its Way under Ground like a Mole rising again at or near this Town of  Leatherhead  where its wandering Streams are united again and form a pretty large River as they were before running together under  Leatherhead  Bridge and from thence to  Cobham  and so it pursues its Course to the  Thames  which it joins at  Molesey  which doubtless takes its Name from the River  And here I cannot but take Notice of an unaccountable Error into which all the Writers I have met with have unwarily fallen on account of this little River hiding itself in the Earth and finding its Way under Ground from the Foot of  Beechworth  or  Betsworthcastle  near  Boxhill  and then rising again at  Leatherhead  as above as if the Water had at once ingulph'd itself in a Chasm of Earth or sunk in a Whirlpit The great  Camden  has not a little contributed to this Error in his Account thereof  but as he is in some measure set right by an Observation and Note in the last Edition of his  Britannia  by the Right Rev Continuator I shall have the less Occasion to insist upon the Matter and shall therefore refer to them and only mention what I have myself observed on this Occasion having resided some time in the Neighbourhood  The Current of the River being much obstructed by the Interposition of  Boxhill  which interrupting its free Course forces the Waters to find their Way thro' as well as they can and in order to this coming near that Part called the  Stomacher  the Waters sink insensibly away lessening the Stream for near Two Miles and these Chanels they call the  Swallows  and the whole Ground on the Bank of the River where it is flat and low is full of these subterraneous Passages so that if on any sudden Rain the River swells over the Banks it is observed not to go back into the Chanel again when the Flood abates but to sink away into the Earth in the Meadows where it spreads  These  Swallows  for there are many and not one called the  Swallow  as is said in Mr  Camden  tho' they diminish the Stream much do not so drink it up as to make it disappear but when it crosses the Roof near  Mickleham  it runs very sharp and broad nor did I ever know it without Water in the driest Summer in that Place On the contrary I have known it so deep the Waggons and Carriages have not dared to go thro'  Below this Place the Hills rise again on the other Side very high and particularly on the Ridge which the Country People call the  Ashcombhills  and they seem to force the River again West so it surrounds most of the Park formerly belonging to Sir  Richard Studdolph  and has several Bridges upon it and by this time indeed so much of it is sunk away that sometimes the Chanel tho' full of Water in Pits and Holes  cannot be perceived to run but this must be in a very dry Season and still the Chanel is visible where it runs at other times rapidly enough  This Part which has the least Water continuing about half a Mile we then perceive the Stream very visibly to be increased so that it takes Vent again now in thousands of little Springs till in another half Mile it is an ample River again and passes in full Streams under  Leatherhead  Bridge as above  A further Proof of the gradual sinking away of the Water take as follows In  October  there happened a very sudden hasty Landflood which swelled the River to a very great Height and particularly so high that at  Beechworthcastle  and at other Gentlemens Seats near the River where they had Fishponds that were fed by the River it overflowed their Ponds and carried off all their Fish Sir  Adam Brown  lived then at  Beechworthcastle  and his Son and the young Gentlemen of the neighbouring Families disturbed at the Loss of their Fish came all down to  Darking  where they raised a little Troop of the young Fellows and Boys of the Town and all went together to that Part of the River which runs by the Foot of the  Stomacher  of  Boxhill    There was a low flat Piece of Meadowground lying close to the River on one Side just opposite to which the Hill lying also close to the River made up the Bank on the other this Piece of Ground might contain about Four or Five Acres and lying hollow in the Middle like the Shape of a Drippingpan was by the Overflowing of the River so full of Water that the Bank which lay close to the River tho' higher than the rest was not to be seen  The Gentlemen set themselves to raise this Bank so as to separate the Water in the hollow Part of the Field from that in the River and then made a Return to it at the Upper or Eastend of the Field so that no more Water could run into the Field from  any Part of the River And the Event was that in about Two Nights and a Day exclusive of the Time they took in making their Dams the Water sunk all away in the Field and the Fish being surrounded were caught as it were in a Trap and the Purchace fully recompensed their Labour for the like Quantity of Fish great and small I believe was never taken at once in this Kingdom out of so small a River  This Story I mention as a Demonstration of the Manner of this River losing itself under Ground or being  swallowed up  as they call it for this Field where the Water sunk away is just at the Place which Mr  Camden  calls  Swallow  near the Village of  Mickleham  and under the Precipice of the Hill and yet the Water was Two Nights and a Day sinking leisurely off And in this manner and no other does so much of the River as passes under Ground sink away  The Town of  Darking  is eminent for several little Things worth Observation as first for the great  Roman  Highway called  Stoneystreet  which passes thro' the Churchyard of this Town Secondly for a little Common or Heath called the  Cottman Dean  or the Heath of  Poor Cottages  for so the Word signifies belonging to the Town and where their Almshouse stands which some learned Physicians believe to be the best Air in  England  Thirdly for Mr  Howard  's House and Garden called  Deepden  which stand in a small Valley environed with steep Hills on every Side the Levelground about the House was laid out into pleasant Walks and Gardens which were planted with a great Variety of Exotick Trees and Plants and the Hills were planted with Trees on every Side excepting the South Aspect which was planted with Vines and formerly there has been some tolerable good Wine made there tho' the Hill is so steep that it is very difficult to walk up  it At present the Gardens and Vineyard are neglected and many of the Exotick Trees have been destroy'd On the Summit of the Hill above the Vineyard is a Summerhouse from which in a clear Day you may discern the Sea over the  Southdowns  near  Arundel    The Market of  Darking  is the most famous in  England  for Poultry and particularly for the fattest Geese and the largest Capons They are brought hither from as far as  Horsham  in  Sussex  and 'tis the Business of all the Country on that Side for many Miles to breed and fatten them up and some are so large as to be little inferior to Turkeys I have seen them sold for  s  to  s    d  each and weighing from to or lb apiece  On  Holy Thursday  here is also a Fair chiefly for Lambs and the greatest in  England  of that Kind I have passed over the so much celebrated House of Mr  Evelyn  at  Wotton  near  Darking  not that it is not worth Notice but because so many others have said so much of it  From  Boxhill  and particularly from this Part of it is a fair View in clear Weather quite over the  Weald  of  Sussex  to the  Southdowns  and by the Help of Glasses the Town of  Horsham Ashdown  Forest the Duke of  Somerset  's House at  Petworth  and the  Southdowns  as they range between  Brighthelmston  and  Arundel  may be plainly seen besides an unbounded Prospect into  Kent    The Vale beneath this Hill is for many Miles East and West called the  Holmward  or  Holmsdale  in the woody Part of which are often found Outlying Red Deer and in the Days of King  James  II or while he was Duke of  York  they have hunted the largest Stags here that have been seen in  England  The Duke took great Care to have them preserved for his own Sport but they have since that been most of them destroy'd  This  Holmward  is now chiefly overgrown with Furz but was famous for producing such Quantities of Strawberries that they were carried to Market by Horseloads  It is suggested that this Place was in antient Times the Retreat for many Ages of the native  Britons  whom the  Romans  could never drive out and after that it was the like to the  Saxons  when the  Danes  harassed the Nation and ravaged the Country whereever they came On this Account they retain here in Memory the following Lines  This is  Holmesdale  Never conquer'd never shall  The Country tho' wild still and perhaps having the same Countenance now in many Places as it had a thousand Years ago yet in other Places is cultivated and has Roads passable enough in the Summer quite thro' it on every Side and the Woods are in a great measure cleared off  Keeping along the Bottom of these Hills and yet not entering into this Vale the Country is dry sandy or gravelly and full of Gentlemens Houses and good Towns tho' if we go but a little to the Righthand South into the wild Part 'tis a deep strong and in the wet Season an unpassable Clay  In passing thro'  Holmesdale  upon the Ridge of Mountains which extend from  Kent  to the  Land'send  you come to  Wotton  a small Village near which is the antient Seat of the  Evelyns  which is situated amongst Meadows having pleasant Streams of Water passing thro' them and the neighbouring Hills covered with Woods which renders the Situation pleasant in the Summerseason but the Roads about it being very bad in Winter it is not so convenient an Habitation at that Season  Near this Place is situated  Lithhill  which rises gradually from hence for near Three Miles to the  South from the Top of which you have a full Prospect of the whole Counties of  Surrey  and  Sussex  Part of  Hampshire Berkshire Oxfordshire Buckinghamshire Hertfordshire Middlesex Kent  and  Essex  the whole Extent of this Prospect being thought near Miles and that without the Help of Glasses  Travelling East at the Foot of the Hills we came to  Rygate  a large Markettown situated in the Valley of  Holmesdale  where are still to be seen the Ruins of a Castle with a long Vault and a Room at the End of it in which 'tis said the Barons who were in Arms against King  John  held their private Meetings  Near this also are two miserable Borough Towns which nevertheless send each of them Two Members to Parliament to wit  Gatton  under the Side of the Hill almost at  Rygate  and  Bleechingly  more Eastward  At  Nutfield  between  Rygate  and  Beechingly  is another Branch of the Family of  Evelyn  who have flourished there many Years  From hence crossing still all the Roads leading from  London  into  Sussex  we came again to a Village called  Godstone  which lies on the Road from  London  to  Lewes    And keeping on East we came to  Westerham  a neat handsome wellbuilt Markettown the first in  Kent  on that Side The late Earl of  Jersey  built or rather finished for it was begun by a private Gentleman a very noble House here called  Squirries  which is now in the Possession of  John Warde    Esq  Son to Sir  John Warde  who was Lord Mayor of  London  in the Year The House stands on a small Eminence regarding the Land in the Front but on the Back of the House the Ground rises very high and is divided into several steep Slopes which renders the Situation  damp and cold Near the House are some Woods thro' which the present Possessor has cut several Ridings and on the other Side of the Hill behind the House arise Nine considerable Springs which unite at a small Distance and these form the River  Dart  which runs thro'  Dartford  and afterwards discharges itself into the  Thames    All this Part of the Country from  Guilford  to this Place is very agreeably pleasant healthy and fruitful and is overspread with good Towns Gentlemens Houses populous Villages abundance of Fruit with Hopgrounds and Cherryorchards and the Lands well cultivated but all on the Righthand that is to say South is overgrown with Timber has abundance of waste and wild Grounds and Forests and Woods with many large Ironworks at which they cast Ironcaldrons Chimneybacks Furnaces Retorts Boilingpots Iron Cannon Bombshells Stinkpots Handgrenadoes Cannonball  c  From hence going forward East we come to  Riverhead  a Town on the Road from  London  to  Tunbridge  and then having little to speak of in  Kent  except some petty Markettowns such as  Wrotham  commonly called  Rootham TownMalling Cranbrook  and the like of which I have taken some Notice before I turned North and came to  Bromley  a Markettown made famous by an Hospital or College built there by Dr  John Warner  Lord Bishop of  Rochester  for the Relief of poor Widows of loyal and orthodox Clergymen who are allowed each  l per Annum  and a Chaplain  l  and has had many Gifts and Charities bestowed on it since  Near this Town we turned away by  Beckenham  and thro'  Norwood  to  Croyden  in the Way we saw  Dulwich  or  Sydenhamwells  where great Crouds of the lower Class of People throng every Summer from  London  to drink the Waters there and at  Stretham  and the rather because it lies so near  London  that they can walk to it in the Morning and return at Night  Croydon  has a great Cornmarket but chiefly for Oats and Oatmeal for the Service of  London  The Town is large and full of Citizens from  London  in it is the antient Palace of the Archbishops of  Canterbury  and several of them lie buried in the Church here particularly Archbishop  Whitgift  who not only repaired the Palace but built and endowed the famous Hospital which is for a Warden and Men and Women and the Freeschool  From hence we passed by  Beddington  where is the Seat or Mansionhouse of the antient Family of the  Carews  The House is noble and the Gardens fine yet Architects say that the two Wings are too deep for the Body of the House that they should either have been more asunder or not so long The Court before them is extremely fine as is the Canal in the Park before the Court having a River running thro' it the Gardens take up all the flat Part of the Park with Vista's or Prospects for Two or Three Miles The Orangetrees continue and are the only ones in  England  that grow in the natural Ground they have moving Houses to shelter them in the Winter from the Inclemencies of our Climate and are loaded with Fruit in the Summer They have stood in the Ground where they now grow above Years  From hence it is but a little Mile to  Cashalton  a Country Village situate among innumerable Springs of Water which all together form a River in the very Street of the Town and joining the other Springs which come from  Croydon  and  Beddington  make one Stream called the  Wandell  This Village tho' lying among such delightful Springs is yet upon firm Chalk and having the  Downs  adjoining makes  the most agreeable Spot on this Side of  London  as is abundantly testify'd by its being crouded as it were with fine Houses of the Citizens of  London  some of which are built with such a Profusion of Expence that they look rather like Seats of the Nobility than the Countryhouses of Citizens and Merchants Mr  Scawen  Knight of the Shire for this County design'd a noble House here but it is not proceeded with That which once belonged to Sir  John Fellows  Subgovernor of the  SouthSea  Company in the fatal Year was built by Dr  Ratcliff  but the Gardens were made by Sir  John  It was purchased by the Right Honourable  Philip  Lord  Hardwick  Lord High Chancellor of  Great Britain  by whom it was lately sold to  William Mitchel  of  Huntingdon  who now possesses it I cannot dwell on the Description of all the fine Houses in this and the neighbouring Villages I shall speak of them again in bulk with their Neighbours of  Mitcham Stretham Tooting Clapham  and others but I must take a Trip here cross the  Downs  to  Epsom    Bansteaddowns  need no Description other than this that being so near  London  and surrounded as they are with pleasant Villages the Ground smooth soft level and dry even in but a few Hours after Rain they conspire to make the most delightful Spot of Ground of that Kind in all this Part of  Britain    About four Miles over those delicious  Downs  bring us to  Epsom  a wellbuilt large and handsome Village which abounds with fine Houses the Retreats principally of the  London  Merchants It was very much frequented a few Years ago on account of its Mineral Waters which issue from a rising Ground nearer  Ashted  than  Epsom  but they are now tho' not impaired in their Virtues yet pretty much so in their Reputation possibly owing more than any thing else to the Place being too near  London  for a Journey for the Quality and Gentry according to the old Saying  Farfetch'd and dearbought is fittest for the Ladies  The Hall Galleries and other publick Apartments are run to Decay and there remains but one House on the Spot which is inhabited by a Countryman and his Wife who carry the Waters in Bottles to the adjacent Places  There are a great many fine Seats around this Place which we have not Room to describe such as the Lord  Baltimore  's Lady  Fielding  's Mr  Mitchell  's at  Cashalton  just mention'd Mr  Scawen  's and many others particularly that formerly called  Nonsuch  which was once a Royal Palace and finely situated King  Charles  II gave it to the Duchess of  Cleveland  and she sold it to my Lord  Berkeley  who built a fine Seat with the Materials of it near  Epsom  called  Durdans Nonsuch  is now but a Farmhouse and  Durdans  is in the Possession of the Lord  North  and  Guilford  but his Royal Highness  Frederick  Prince of  Wales  has lately taken it for a pleasurable Retreat when he is not disposed to go so far as  Cliefden  in  Bucks    From  Epsom  that I might thoroughly visit the County of  Surrey  I rode over stiff Clays and thro' very bad Roads to  Kingston  from whence I had a fine View of  Hamptoncourt  at a Distance but that I reserve for another Journey  Kingston  is a good Markettown remarkable for a Freeschool erected and endowed by Queen  Elizabeth  an Almshouse built in by Alderman  Cleaver  of  London  and endowed with Lands of  l  a Year a House were formerly resided the great Earl of  Warwick  surnamed  Makeking  besides  Coomb  which was likewise his but now in the Family of the  Harveys  from whence the Waters of certain Springs are said to be conveyed in leaden Pipes under the Road and the  Thames  to  Hamptoncourt  Three Miles in Length Several of  the old  Saxon  Kings were not only crowned but had their actual Residence here whence it took its Name of  Kingstown  It had once the Privilege of sending Burgesses to Parliament but now that is lost  From hence turning Southward on the Road to  Guilford  we come to  Esher  where was formerly a Seat built by Cardinal  Wolsey  to which during his Ministry he frequently retired for Amusement The Gate to this  Gothick  Building remaining was turned into a Dwellinghouse which was lately sold to the Right Honourable  Henry Pelham    Esq  who has beautified the old Part and made additional Buildings to it in the same  Gothick  Style and laid out the Grounds about it in so elegant a Taste as makes it one of the finest Seats in the Neighbourhood of  London  but the House stands so low as not to be seen until you come very near it and the River  Mole  running near the Back of the House renders it very damp which greatly diminishes the Pleasure of the Place tho' there has been no Cost spared to render it elegant  Near  Esher  on the Lefthand of the great Road lies  Claremont  which was a small House built under a Hill covered with Wood by the late Sir  John Vanbrugh  and purchased by his Grace the Duke of  Newcastle  who has been at a great Expence in beautifying the Gardens  c  and has added to the House a great Extent of Buildings in the same Style with the original House and has also built one large Room in which his Grace entertains Foreign Embassadors and where all the magnificent Dinners which the Duke makes in the Country are served up The House is situated so near the Hill that the Moisture issuing from thence occasions it to be very damp and the Winds being reverberated back from the Woods on the House cause most of the Chimneys to smoke so that this is a bad Habitation  in Winter but as it is the Place to which his Grace usually retires from publick Business whenever his Leisure will permit he has not spared Expence to render it as agreeable as possible tho' as several Persons have had the Contrivance of his Gardens and Buildings there is not any uniform Taste to be found in either which is greatly to be regretted since the noble Owner has been so much intent on having it worthy of himself  From hence turning on the Right towards the River of  Thames  we pass  Walton  and  Weybridge  where are several fine Seats but particularly those of the Earls of  Lincoln  and  Portmore    In the first of these is a noble Terracewalk elevated so high above the Level of the neighbouring Ground as to afford a Prospect of the Country as also a View of the River  The other Seat was beautified by the Countess of  Dorchester  in the Reign of King  James  II Here is a Walk planted with  Acacia  Trees which at that Time were esteemed great Curiosities  The Country hereabout is very low and flat so that in Winter the Meadows are generally flooded which renders the Air damp and cold and the Roads are sometimes almost impassable but in Summer the Meadows afford a good Quantity of Hay which sufficiently recompenses the Owner for the Disadvantage of Situation  Near  Weybridge  is a pleasant small Seat now in the Possession of  Philip Southcoat    Esq  called  Wobournfarm  The House is situated low but is not very damp and has the Advantage of being screen'd from the Violence of strong Winds by tall Trees in the Neighbourhood In the Front of the House is a small Island which in Summer is stocked with Sheep who are constantly feeding in View of the principal Rooms of the House The Water surrounding this Island is conducted in a serpentine  Form so as to have little Resemblance to Art The Fields above the House are kept very neat being rolled and fed so that there is a fine Carpet of Grass the Walks round them being made dry by Gravel and on each Side planted with sweet Shrubs and Flowers in a rural manner At the Upperpart of these Fields is a Spot of Ground laid out in Gardens which being too regular do not so well correspond with the other Parts which are laid out to answer the Name of a Farm very properly but this Part has something of too much Stiffness and Regularity to agree with the rest  From this Spot of Ground is a most delightful Prospect over a large Extent of Meadows bounded by the River  Thames  which winds in an agreeable manner and having frequently large West Country Barges floating in it with their broad Sails appear as so many moving Objects in a Picture and greatly enliven the Prospect  From hence also are seen Ten or Twelve Villages and several fine Houses and  Chertsey  Bridge appears as if it were intended for a principal Object Indeed the whole Spot may justly be deemed one of the sweetest Retirements near  London    Keeping the River now on my Left as I did before on my Righthand drawing nearer to  London  we came to  Ham  and  Petersham  little Villages the first famous for a most pleasant Palace of the late Duke of  Lauderdale  close by the River now possessed by the Earl of  Dysert  a House King  Charles  II used to be frequently at and was exceedingly pleased with The Avenues of this fine House to the Landside lead up to the End of the Village of  Petersham  where the Wall of  New Park  comes also close to the Town on the other Side in an Angle of which stood a most delicious House built by the late Earl of  Rochester  Lord High Treasurer in King  James  II's Reign as also in Part of Queen  Anne  's  Reign This fine House was burnt down in the Year by an accidental Fire so sudden and furious that the Family who were all at home had scarce time to save their Lives  Nor was the House tho' so exquisitely finished so beautiful within and without the greatest Loss sustained the rich Furniture the curious Collection of Paintings and the inestimable Library of the first Earl of  Clarendon  Lord Chancellor of  England  and Author of that most excellent  History of the Rebellion  of which the World knows so much were here wholly consumed a Loss irreparable as the latter contained among other valuable Things several Manuscripts relating to those Times and to Things transacted by himself and by the King his Master both at Home and Abroad besides other rare and curious Collections made by that noble and learned Author in foreign Countries  The Offices escaped the Fate the House met with and on the same Spot of Ground where the House stood the Right Honourable the Lord  Harrington  Secretary of State erected another after the Design of the Right Honourable the Earl of  Burlington  and when I have said this I need not say it is equally a convenient and elegant Edifice The Front indeed next the Court has not a very striking Appearance being very plain and the Entrance into the House not greatly to be praised But the South Front next the Garden tho' very plain yet is bold and regular The Apartments next the Garden which are chiefly designed for State are also very elegant and beautifully finished  The Gardens which before were crouded with Pluntations near the House are now laid open in Lawns of Grass and the Kitchengarden which was situated on the Eastside of the House is removed out of Sight and that Ground is now converted to an open Slope of Grass which leads up to  a Terrace of great Length from which is a Prospect of the River  Thames  the Town of  Twickenham  and all the beautiful Seats round about that Part of the Country almost to  Kingstonbridge  On the other Side of the Terrace on a rising Ground is a large Plantation of Wood and on the Summit of the Hill is erected a fine Pleasurehouse which commands a Prospect of the Country every Way for many Miles so that by Foreigners this View is esteemed the most beautiful of any near  London    From hence we came to  Richmond  lately the delightful Retreat of his Majesty and his Royal Consort the Queen who took great Delight therein to the Time of her Death and made not only vast Improvements and Alterations there but purchased several fine Houses on  Kewgreen  as that of Lady  Eyre  for his Royal Highness the Duke that of Sir  Thomas Abney  for the Princesses and his Royal Highness Prince  Frederick  mean while made considerable Improvements in the fine House and Gardens belonging formerly to the Lady  Capell  while her Majesty was used to divert herself at her Royal Dairyhouse and in her beautiful Hermitage  Merlin  's Cave and in other charming Improvements which she made in the Park and Gardens of this delightful Place All which are so well known that we need not insist upon them  The Court being so near must needs have filled  Richmond  which was before a most agreeable Retreat for the first and secondrate Gentry with a great deal of the best Company in  England  And indeed this Town and the Country all round it have much increased in Buildings lately  The Lord Viscount  Palmerston  the worthy Son and Successor to the Honour and Estate of the great Sir  William Temple  has a fine Seat and Gardens hard by at  Sheen  The Gardens were finished as well as contrived by the great Genius of Sir  William    and as they were his last Delight in Life so they were every way suited to be so to a Man of his Sense and Capacity who knew what kind of Life was best fitted to make a Man's last Days happy  It is not easy to describe the Beauty with which the Banks of the  Thames  shine on either Side of the River from hence to  London  much more than our Ancestors even but one Age ago knew any thing of If for pleasant Villages great Houses Palaces Gardens  c  it was true in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time according to the Poet that  The  Thames  with Royal  Tyber  may compare  What may be said of it now when for One fine House to be seen then there are for aught I know an hundred even as you sit in a Boat and pass up and down the River  First beginning from  Hamhouse  as above  Richmond  Palace salutes the Eye being formerly no more than a Lodge in the Park but now makes a Royal Figure  From  Richmond  to  London  the River Sides abound with Villages and those Villages so full of beautiful Buildings charming Gardens and rich Habitations of Gentlemen of Quality that nothing can equal it no not the Country for Miles round  Paris  tho' that indeed is a kind of Prodigy  It is impossible to view these Countries from any rising Ground and not be ravished with the delightful Prospect For Example Suppose you take your View from the little rising Hills about  Clapham  if you look to the East there you see the pleasant Villages of  Peckham  and  Camberwell  with some of the finest Dwellings about  London  then turning South we see  Loughborough  House near  Kennington  the Duchess of  Bedford  's at  Stretham  other fine Seats about  Croydon  a whole Town of fine Houses at  Cashalton  Sir  Nicolas Carew  's and others at  Beddington  Sir  Theodore Janssen  's and that lately built by the Duchess Dowager of  Marlborough  at  Wimbleton  other fine Houses at  Tooting  besides a very great Number in  Clapham  itself On the Southwest also you have Mr  Harvey  's at  Coomb  formerly the Palace of the aforementioned  Makeking  Earl of  Warwick  and from him called  Coombnevil  with all the Villages mentioned above and the Country adjoining filled with the Palaces of the  British  Nobility and Gentry already spoken of looking North behold to crown all a fair Prospect of the City of  London  the most glorious Sight without Exception that the World at present can shew or perhaps could since the Sacking of  Rome    It is impossible in one Journey to describe effectually this Part of the County of  Surrey  lying from  Kingston  to  London  and  Greenwich  where I set out that is including the Villages of  Richmond Petersham Eastsheen Mortlake Putney Wandsworth Barnelms Battersea Wimbleton Tooting Clapham Camberwell Peckham  and  Deptford  and I must therefore quit the ample Subject and come to  Southwark  a Suburb to rather than a Part of  London  but of which this may be said with Justice that it would be  A Royal City were not  London  by  To give you a brief Description of  Southwark  it might be called a long Street of about Nine Miles in Length as it is now built on Eastward reaching from  Vauxhall  to  Londonbridge  and from the Bridge to  Deptford  and up to  Deptford  Bridge which parts it from  Greenwich  all the Way winding and turning as the River does except only in that Part which reaches from  Cuckold'spoint  to  Deptford  which winds somewhat more than the River  In the Centre which is opposite to the Bridge it is thicken'd with Buildings and may be reckoned near a Mile broad  viz  from the Bridge to the End of  Kentstreet  and  Blackmanstreet  and about the  Mint    The Borough of  Southwark  is exceeding populous Take it as it was antiently bounded it contained Nine Parishes but as it is now extended and joins with  Deptford  it contains Eleven large Parishes  The first Thing we meet with considerable is at the  Springgarden  just at the Corner where the Road turns away to go from  Vauxhall  Turnpike towards  Newington  There are the Remains of the Lines cast up in the Time of the  Romans  which were repaired in the Civil Wars as a Fortification to this Part of the Town at the Corner was a very large Bastion or Fort which commanded the Pass on that Side and farther on at the Corner of  St George'sfields  by the  Ducking Pond  was another the Water of what is now called the  Ducking Pond  still appears to have been the Moat to the Fort and the Lines are still so high and undemolished that it would be no difficult Matter to repair and perfect them again  That this was formerly a  Roman  Camp or Station is plain from the many  Roman  Urns and Coins  Opera Tessellata  and other Antiquities which have been frequently dug up hereabouts And as there are pretty good Authorities of antient  London  lying on the Southside of the  Thames  it is but a reasonable Conjecture that these Lines were cast up and fortified to prevent the Incursions of the  Britons  into  Kent  for the Military Way crossed the River at the  Horseferry  at  Lambeth  from thence proceeded to  Vauxhall  then turned round to the  Ducking Pond  went on to the Windmill in  St George'sfields  where it crossed the Road to the End of  Kentstreet  where there was a very strong  Fortification of Stone the Foundations of which were dug up in the Year this ran cross a Garden about a Quarter of a Mile from the Stonesend In digging up of this Foundation there appeared two antient Pillars of a large Gate upon each of them had been placed Heads with two Faces curiously cut in Stone one of which was taken up but the other lying in a Quicksand from whence the Springs flowed out pretty freely was rendered more difficult to be taken up and the Curiosity of the People being not very great they contented themselves with getting up one of the Heads which was placed over the Gardener's Door where it remained for several Years until it was known to the Learned Dr  Woodward  who purchased it and kept it in his valuable Collection of Curiosities These Lines were drawn from hence to the  Grange  near  Bermondseystreet  where you see another Fort so plain and so undemolished the Grass now growing over the Works and tho' on the Bastion itself there is frequently Corn sowed that it is almost as visible as it was when it was first thrown down By the Direction of these Lines it is very manifest that  Southwark  was once well fortified for these Lines seem to have been thrown up from the  Thames  at  Lambeth  quite round to the  Thames  at  Deptford  which takes in the whole Extent on the Land and the  Thames  was a Barrier on the other Side  A farther Description of  Southwark  I refer till I come to speak of  London  as one general Appellation for the Two Cities of  London  and  Westminster  for all the Borough of  Southwark  and all the Buildings and Villages included within the Bills of Mortality make but one LONDON in the general Appellation I am  c  LETTER V CONTAINING A Description of Part of the County of  MIDDLESEX  Part of  HANTS  and the County of  WILTS  c  SIR  _AS I came down from  Kingston  in my last Circuit by the South Bank of the  Thames  on the  Surrey  Side of the River so I go up to  Hamptoncourt  now on the North Bank and on the  Middlesex  Side which I mention because as the Sides of the Country bordering on the River lie parallel so the Beauty of the Country the pleasant Situations the Splendor of innumerable fine Buildings Noblemens and Gentlemens Houses and Citizens Retreats are so equal a Match to what I had described on the other Side that one knows not to which to give the Preference but as I must speak of them again when I come to write of the County of  Middlesex  which I have now purposely omitted I pass them over here except the Palace of  Hampton  only which I mentioned in  Middlesex  for the Reasons above  Hamptoncourt  lies on the North Bank of the River  Thames  about Two small Miles from  Kingston  It was built by Cardinal  Wolsey  and fell to the Crown when the King seized his Effects and Estate as did also  Whitehall  another House of the Cardinal's building  Whoever knew  Hamptoncourt  before it was begun to be rebuilt or alter'd by the late King  William  must acknowledge it was a very complete Palace then and fit for a King and tho' it might not according to the modern Method of Building or of Gardening pass for a Thing exquisitely fine yet it shewed a Situation exceedingly capable of Improvement and of being made one of the most delightful Palaces in  Europe    This her Majesty Queen  Mary  was so sensible of that while the King had ordered the pulling down the old Apartments and building them up in that most beautiful Form which we see them now appear in her Majesty impatient of enjoying so agreeable a Retreat fixed upon a Building formerly made use of chiefly for landing from the River and therefore called the  Water Gallery  here she ordered all the little neat curious Things to be done which suited her own Conveniency and made it the pleasantest little Place within Doors that could possibly be made tho' its Situation would not allow it to stand after the great Building was finished  The Queen had here her Gallery of Beauties being the Pictures at full Length of the principal Ladies in her Retinue Her Majesty's Apartments for her private Retreat only were exquisitely furnished and there were among the Furniture several curious Pieces of her own Work  The Ground on the Southwest Side of the Building has received many Alterations since the pulling down of the Watergallery which stood before this handsome Front of the House and intercepted  the Prospect of it from the River This Spot was then laid out into small Inclosures surrounded with tall Hedges to break the Violence of the Winds and render them proper for the Reception of such Exotick Plants in Summer as were removed out of the Conservatories during that Season In each of these Places is contrived a Bason which is constantly supplied with Water for the Support of these Plants in dry Weather and as these are situated near the great Apartments most of the Plants may be viewed from the Windows and the lower Part of the House under the great Apartments being contrived for a Greenhouse the Plants need not be carried far when they are removed out or into the Conservatory which was very properly contrived by the Designers  At the Westend of this Spot was a large Hothouse for the maintaining such tender Exotick Plants as require a large Share of Warmth to preserve them in this Climate Of all these Parts of Gardening Queen  Mary  was so very fond that she allowed a handsome Salary to Dr  Plukenet  a very learned Botanist for overlooking and registering the curious Collection of Plants which were then in that Garden but since the Death of that Queen these Things have been so much neglected that very few of the most curious Plants are now in Being there which is much to be lamented for however the Taste for this Part of Gardening may have with Reason been neglected by private Persons yet surely at a Royal Palace all these Things should be kept up in the utmost Magnificence as an Encouragement to Ingenuity and for the Honour of the Kingdom This Taste was by  Lewis  XIV of  France  carried to a very great Height and had the Persons employed by that Prince been so well acquainted with the Construction of these Conservatories as many of the  English  are at this Day we  might have expected in his Royal Gardens to have seen most of the curious Plants in the known Parts of the World  Here stand advanced on Two Pedestals of Stone Two Marble Vases or Flowerpots of exquisite Workmanship the one done by an  Englishman  and the other by a  German  'Tis hard to say which is the best Performance tho' the doing of it was a kind of Trial of Skill between them but it gives us room without any Partiality to say they were both Masters of their Art  The Parterre on that Side descends from the Terracewalk by Steps and on the Left a Terrace goes down to the Waterside overlooking the Garden on the Eastward Front and affords a most pleasant Prospect  This Part of the Garden was at first laid out in a Parterre of Scrollwork in Box which was not only very costly at first making but was also very expensive in keeping constantly clipped which together with the ill Scent which frequently reached to the Royal Apartments occasioned its being demolished and the Ground disposed into another Form And if at the same time all the shorn evergreen Trees had been thrown out and a finer Disposition made of the Ground it would have much better corresponded with the noble Apartments which overlook it than it does at present  On the North Side of the House where the Chapel and some Part of the old Buildings required to be covered from View the Ground was laid out in a Wilderness with a Labyrinth surrounded by high Espalier Hedges and this was at that time thought one of the finest disposed Parts of the Garden But as the whole Contrivance of the Plantations is in regular strait Walks bounded on each Side by tall clipped Hedges which divide the whole Ground into angular Quarters to every Person of  Taste it must be very far from affording any Pleasure since nothing can be more disagreeable than to be immured between Hedges so as to have the Eye confined to a strait Walk and the Beauty of the Trees growing in the Quarters intirely secluded from the Eye And at the same time as you are walking in this unmeaning Plantation you are denied the Benefit of Shade by being confined to these regular Walks where it would be deemed an unpardonable Fault to suffer the neighbouring Trees to diffuse their Branches over these shorn Hedges so that in the midst of a Wood a Person may faint for Shade in a sultry Day the Air being excluded from these Walks by the taller Trees in the Quarters and pent up Air is much more troublesome in hot Weather than the Heat of the Sun in the most open exposed Plain  As this Wilderness lies opposite to  Bushypark  so there was designed a grand Entrance thro' it to the Palace fronting the Gates of the Park where Two large Pillars were erected to support a magnificent Iron Gate which was designed to have been put up there but how it came to be left unfinished and the pitiful low Gates which by no means correspond with the Pillars put in the Place I could never learn  The House itself is every way answerable on the Outside to the beautiful Prospect and the Two Fronts are the largest and beyond Comparison the finest of the kind in  England  The great Stairs go up from the second Court of the Palace on the Righthand and lead you to the South Prospect  King  William  brought into  England  and placed here in a Gallery built purposely for them the famous  Cartoons  as they are called which are Five Pieces of such Paintings as are not to be match'd in  Europe  It is reported but with what Truth I know not that the late  French  King offer'd  Louis  d'Ors  for these Pictures The King brought a great many other fine Pieces to  England  and from him the Love of fine Paintings so universally spread itself among the Nobility and Persons of Figure all over the Kingdom that it is incredible what Collections have been made by  English  Gentlemen since that Time and how all  Europe  has been romaged as we may say for Pictures to bring over hither where for Twenty Years together they brought in vast Profit to such as collected them for Sale But the Rates are abated since and we are now glutted with the Copies and Frauds of the  Dutch  and  Flemish  Painters who have imposed grosly upon us  Queen  Mary  lived not to see this Palace completely finish'd and 'tis said King  William  design'd to have made it more capacious and noble had he lived  After the Death of King  William HamptonCourt  seem'd in a manner neglected It is an Observation made by some that  Hampton Court  has ever since the Time of King  Charles  I been favoured by every alternate Prince King  Charles  I delighting in Country Retirements took great Pleasure here and had he liv'd had purposed to improve it considerably but it became at last one of his Prisons  King  Charles  II may well be said to have a Dislike to the Place for the Treatment his Royal Father met with there and particularly as  Cromwell  afterwards made it his Summer Residence He therefore chose  Windsor  and bestow'd a vast Sum in beautifying the Castle there which brought it to the Perfection we see it in at this Day some few Alterations excepted made in the Time of King  William    King  James  took but little Delight in retired Palaces his Bent and Taste inclining another way  But King  William  fix'd upon  HamptonCourt  and improv'd it as beforemention'd  Queen  Anne  being taken up for one Part of her Reign in her kind Regards to the Prince her Spouse was obliged to consult his Health and reside where that confin'd him which for the most part was at  Kensington  where he died but her Majesty always discover'd her Delight for  Windsor  where she chose the little House as 'twas call'd opposite to the Castle and frequently took the Air in her Chaise in the Parks and Forest  In the Reign of King  George  I  HamptonCourt  came into Request again  From  HamptonCourt  I directed my Course for a Journey into the Southwest Part of  England  and to take up my Beginning where I concluded my last I cross'd to  Chertsey  on the  Thames  a Town I mention'd before from whence crossing the  Black Desart  of  Bagshot  I took in my Way to  Hampshire Ockingham  in  Berkshire  lying on the Skirts of  Windsor Forest  it is a pretty large Town and has a wellfrequented Market and a good Markethouse in the Middle It is govern'd by an Alderman Recorder and Burgesses has a Freeschool and likewise an Hospital with a Chaplain belonging to it It carries on a good Trade in Silk Stockens and Cloth  From hence I fell down towards  Basingstoke  which is situate in the midst of Woods and rich fertile Pastures the Country round about is spread with the Houses of the Nobility and Gentry A little before we came to the Town we pass'd by a House built out of the Ruins and on the Scite of  Old Basinghouse  a famous Fortress in the Time of the Civil Wars belonging to the then Marquis of  Winchester  Ancestor of the Duke of  Bolton    This House garison'd by a resolute Band of old Soldiers under the Command of the Marquis was a great Curb to the Parliament Party throughout that whole War till after a vigorous Defence it was taken and the brave Marquis in it by  Cromwell  who in Revenge for the obstinate Resistance it made put almost all the Garison to the Sword and burnt down the noble Fabrick to the Ground which he said was fitter for the Residence of an Emperor than a Subject The present House is in no wise equal to the Magnificence which Fame gives to the antient House whose Strength of Building was such as to resist the Battery of Cannon in several Attacks 'Tis incredible what Booty the Garison of this Place pick'd up lying as they did just on the great Western Road where they intercepted the Carriers plunder'd the Waggons and suffer'd nothing to pass to the great Interruption of the Trade of the City of  London    Basingstoke  is a Corporation and a large populous Town it has a good Market for Corn especially Barley as there are a great many Maltsters there Some few Years ago a Manufacture of making Druggets and Shalloons was set up here and as successfully carried on which employs a great Number of poor People  Near this Town a bloody Battle was fought in between the  Saxons  and  Danes    From this Town the great Western Road goes on to  Whitchurch  a mean Town which however has a Market and is govern'd by a Mayor Northeast of which lyes  Kingsclere  a pleasant Markettown on the  Oxford  Road from  Basingstoke  It was antiently famous for having been the Seat of the  Saxon  Kings and from thence takes its Name  But I had like to have forgot the famous  Vindomia  or  Silchester  which is situated in  Hants    on the Borders of  Berkshire  and is famous for its Antiquity  Its Situation is very high hid with Wood Many were the  Roman  Roads which met here tho' now scarce any which is one Reason why 'tis so little known another is its want of Inns for the Accommodation of Travellers for  Aldermaston  a pretty neat Village beautifully situated which is Three Miles distant is the nearest Town where Lodging is to be found The Walls of this City are standing more or less perfect quite round perhaps the most intire in the  Roman  Empire especially the Northside which is a most agreeable Sight It is composed of Flint and Ragstone There was a broad Ditch quite round and now almost impassable and full of Springs Hereandthere  Roman  Bricks are left in the Walls Tho' on the Outside they are of a considerable Height yet the Ground within is so raised as nearly to be equal to the Top and that quite round cover'd with Oaks and other Timbertrees of no mean Bulk  Constantius  the Son of  Constantine the Great  is said to have built it and sow'd Corn in the Track of the Walls as an Omen of their Perpetuity Now indeed the whole City is arable and in the Fields  Roman  Bricks and other Reliques are scatter'd and Coins daily found It has only one Farmhouse and a Church The Reverend and Learned Mr  Betham  late Minister of this Place is buried under the North Wall of the Chancel withoutside within is another Monument of a Person of Quality They both were drown'd in  Fleetditch  A Spring rises from under the Wall of the Churchyard  Five hundred Feet without the City on the Northeast Side is a great Curiosity which the Vulgar think was a Castle but in reality an Amphitheatre in all respects like that of  Dorchester  This  noble Antiquity has from Time immemorial been a Yard for Cattle and a Wateringpond so that it is a Wonder their Trampling has not defaced it much more than it has My Resolution being to take in my Way what I had pass'd by before I was obliged to go off to the Lefthand to  Alresford  and  Winchester    Alresford  was a flourishing Markettown and tho' it had no great Trade and very little if any Manufactures yet what is very remarkable there was no Collection made in the Town for the Poor nor any low enough to take Alms of the Parish  But this happy Circumstance which so distinguish'd  Alresford  from all her Neighbours was brought to an End in when by a sudden and surprising Fire the whole Town with both the Church and Markethouse was reduced to a Heap of Rubbish and except a few poor Huts at the remotest Ends of the Town not a House left standing The Town is since very handsomely rebuilt and the neighbouring Gentlemen contributed largely to the Relief of the People especially by sending in Timber towards their Building  Here is a very large Pond or Lake of Water kept up to a Head by a strong  Battre d'eau  or Dam which 'tis said was made by the  Romans  and is part of the great  Roman  Highway which leads from  Winchester  to  Alton  and as supposed on to  London  tho' we nowhere see any Remains of it except between  Winchester  and  Alton  and chiefly between this Town and the last mention'd  Near this Town a little Northwest the Duke of  Bolton  has another Seat which tho' not large is a very handsome beautiful Palace and the Gardens not only very exact but very finely situate the Prospect and Vista's noble and great and the Whole very well kept His Grace has no less than Three Seats almost within Sight of one another  viz Abbotstone Basing  and  Hawkwood    From hence at the End of Seven Miles over the  Downs  we come to the very antient City of  Winchester  called in  British Caer Gwent  which signifies the white Town from the chalky Hills near it Not only the great Church which is so famous all over  Europe  and has been so much talk'd of but even the whole City has at a Distance a venerable and antient Face and yet here are many modern Buildings too and some very handsome as the College Schools with the Episcopal Palace built by Bishop  Morley  since the Civil Wars the old Palace of the Bishop having been ruin'd by that known ChurchIncendiary Sir  William Waller  and his Crew of Plunderers who if my Information is not wrong destroy'd more Monuments of the Dead and defac'd more Churches than all the  Roundheads  in  England  beside  This Church and the Schools also are accurately describ'd by several Writers especially by the  Monasticon  where their Antiquity and Original is fully set forth the Outside of the Church is as plain and coarse as if the Founders had abhorr'd Ornaments There is neither Statue nor a Niche for a Statue to be seen on all the Outside no carv'd Work no Spires Towers Pinacles Balustrades or any thing but mere Walls Buttresses Windows and Quoins necessary to the Support and Order of the Building it has no Steeple but a short Tower cover'd flat as if the Top of it had fallen down and it had been cover'd in haste to keep the Rain out till they had Time to build it up again  But the Inside of the Church has many very good things in it and worth Observation it was for some Ages the Buryingplace of many  English Saxon  and  Norman  Kings whose Remains the impious Soldiers in the Civil Wars threw against the painted Glass The Reliques of some of these at the Repair of the Church were collected by Bishop  Fox  and being put together into Six large wooden Chests lin'd with Lead were again interr'd at the Foot of the great Wall in the Choir Three on one Side and Three on the other with an Account whose Bones are in each Chest viz  Rufus Egbert Adulphus Edredus Edmundus Canutus  and those of Queen  Emma  Queen  Mary  was here marry'd to  Philip  of  Spain  The Chair used in that Ceremony is still preserv'd In the Body of the Church is a pretty Cross of  Gothick  Workmanship but ill repair'd The Steps ascending to the Choir make a fine Shew having the Statues of King  James  I and his Son  Charles  in Copper finely cast the first on the Righthand and the other on the Left as you go up to the Choir  The Choir is said to be the longest in  England  The Ornaments of the Choir are the Effects of the Bounty of several Bishops the fine Altar the noblest in  England  by much was given by Bishop  Morley  the Roof and the Coat of Arms of the  Saxon  and  Norman  Kings by Bishop  Fox  and the fine Throne for the Bishop in the Choir was given by Bishop  Mew  in his Lifetime and it was well it was for if he had order'd it by Will there is Reason to believe it had never been done that Reverend Prelate notwithstanding he enjoy'd so rich a Bishoprick scarce leaving Money enough behind him to pay for his Coffin  There are a great many Persons of Rank buried in this Church besides the  Saxon  Kings mention'd above particularly here lies as they told us under a grey Marble  Lucius  the first Christian King of this Island who dy'd Years after Christ and as is pretended founded the Church where the Cathedral now stands There are also the Monuments of Bishop  Fox  Founder of  Corpus Christi  College  Oxon  Bishop  Wainfleet  Founder of  Magdalen  College in the same University in Regard to whose  Memory the said College keep his Monument in neat Repair He is represented lying at length with a Heart in his Hand The Tomb of  William of Wickham  the magnificent Founder of this Cathedral very richly gilt Just under the Altar lies a Son of  William the Conqueror  without any Monument and behind the Altar under a very fine Monument lies the famous Lord Treasurer  Weston  Earl of  Portland  Lord High Treasurer of  England  in the Reign of King  Charles  I His Effigies is in Copper Armour at full Length with his Head rais'd on Three Cushions of the same and is a very magnificent Work There is also a very fine Monument of Cardinal  Beaufort  in his Cardinal's Robes and Hat  The Monument of Sir  John Cloberry  deserves Notice more for his Story than for any thing extraordinary in the Figure This Gentleman was the Person solely entrusted with the Secret of the Restoration of King  Charles  II as the Messenger that pass'd between General  Monk  on one hand and Mr  Montague  and others intrusted by King  Cha  II on the other by which Service Sir  John  then a private Musqueteer only raised himself to the Honour of a Knight with the Reward of a good Estate from the Bounty of the King  It may not be amiss to say a Word or two of the famous  William of Wickham  who built the Body of the Church  He was a Courtier before a Bishop and tho' he had no large Share of Learning he was a great Promoter of it his natural Genius was much beyond his acquired Parts and his Skill in Politicks beyond his Ecclesiastick Knowledge He is said to have put his Master King  Edward  III to whom he was Secretary of State upon the Two great Projects which made his Reign so glorious  viz  Upon setting up his Claim to the Crown of  France  which  brought on the War with  France  in which that Prince was three times victorious in Battle Upon instituting the Order of the Garter in which he obtain'd the Honour for the Bishops of  Winchester  to be always Prelates of the Order as an Appendix to the Bishoprick and he himself was the first the Ensigns of that Honour are join'd with his Episcopal Ornaments in the robing of his Effigies on the Monument above  To the great Honour of this Bishop there are other Foundations of his as much to his Fame as that of this Church of which I shall speak in their Places but particularly the College in this City which is a noble Foundation indeed The Building consists of Two large Courts in which are the Lodgings for the Masters and Seventy Scholars and in the Centre a very noble Chapel beyond that in the second Court are the Schools with a large Cloister beyond them and some Inclosures laid open for the Diversion of the Scholars There also is a great Hall where the Scholars dine In the Chapel Window belonging to the College is good painted Glass of Imagery In the middle of the Cloisters is the Library a strong Stone Building well contriv'd to prevent Fire  In digging the Foundation of a House near the College in a Stone Coffin was found a Stone set in a Gold Ring with this Inscription in very odd Characters supposed to be about the Sixth Century  Domino Comite fidele meo  i e  The Lord being my Guide and faithful Companion  Over the Door of the School stands a very good Statue of the Founder made by  Cibber  whose Workmanship are the two excellent Figures over  Bethlehemgate  the Father of that excellent Comedian  Colley Cibber  PoetLaureat  The Scholars have Exhibitions at a certain time of Continuance here if they please to study in  the new College at  Oxford  built by the same noble Benefactor  The Clergy here live very elegantly in the Close belonging to the Cathedral where besides the Bishop's Palace mentioned above are very good Houses and very handsomely built for the Prebendaries Canons and other Dignitaries of this Church The Deanry is a very pleasant Dwelling the Gardens are large and the River runs thro' them but the Floods in Winter sometimes much incommode them  This School has fully answer'd the End of the Founder who tho' he was no great Scholar resolv'd to erect a House for making the Ages to come more learned than those that went before and many learned and great Men have been educated here  As the City stands in a Vale on the Bank and at the Conjunction of Two small Rivers so the Country rising every way but just as the Course of the Water keeps the Valley open you must necessarily as you go out of the Gates go up Hill every way but when once ascended you come to the most charming Plains and most pleasant Country of that Kind in  England  which continues with very small Intersections of Rivers and Valleys for above Fifty Miles as I shall observe more particularly in the Sequel of this Journey  At the West Gate of this City was antiently a Castle in which 'tis said the  Saxon  Kings kept their Court which however is doubtful and must be meant of the  WestSaxons  only As to the Tale of King  Arthur  's round Table and his Two Dozen of Knights which Table being one Piece of Wood supported by Marble Pillars they still shew in the Townhall said to be Part of the said Castle as a Piece of Antiquity of Years standing and has as they pretend the Names of the said Knights in  Saxon  Characters and yet such as no Man can read all this Story I see no Ground to give the least Credit to  Where this Castle was said to stand the late King  Charles  II mark'd out a very noble Design which had he lived would certainly have made that Part of the Country the Resort of the Quality and Gentry of all Parts of the Kingdom for the Country hereabout far exceeds that of  Newmarketheath  for all kinds of Sport and Diversion  The Building was so far prosecuted that the Front next the City was carried up to the Roof and cover'd but what was further intended was not proceeded on There was a Street of Houses designed from the Gate of the Palace down to the Town but it was never begun to be built the Park mark'd out was exceeding large near Ten Miles in Circumference and ended West upon the open Downs in View of  Stockbridge    This House with a Royal Revenue was afterwards settled by Parliament as an Appenage upon Prince  George  of  Denmark  for his Life in case he had outliv'd the Queen but his Royal Highness dying before her Majesty all Hope of seeing this Design perfected or the House finish'd is now vanish'd And his late Majesty King  George  I made a Present to the Duke of  Bolton  of the fine Pillars of  Italian  Marble which were to have supported its Staircase  There are several other publick Edifices in this City and in the Neighbourhood which I have not Room to describe as the Hospitals and Building adjoining near the Eastgate Towards the North is a Piece of an old Monastery undemolish'd and which is still preserv'd to the Religion being the Residence of some private Roman Catholick Gentlemen where they have an Oratory and as they say live still according to the Rules of  St Benedict  This Building is call'd  Hidehouse  and as they live very usefully  and to the highest Degree obliging among their Neighbours they meet with no Obstruction from any body  Beyond the River Eastward is a high Hill call'd  St Giles  's from an Hospital whose Ruins only are now visible and a Churchyard seeming to have been a Camp besides the Marks of Bastions and Works of Fortifications in the modern Style Here  Waltheof  Earl of  Northumberland  and  Huntingdon  was beheaded by Order of King  William  I whose Body was carried to  Crowland  and said to work Miracles  Winchester  is a Place of no Trade other than is naturally occasion'd by the Inhabitants of the City and neighbouring Villages one with another here is no Manufacture no Navigation there was indeed an Attempt to make the River navigable from  Southampton  and it was once made practicable but it never answered the Expence so as to give Encouragement to the Undertakers to keep it up  Here is a great deal of good Company and Abundance of Gentry being in the Neighbourhood it adds to the Sociableness of the Place the Clergy also here are generally speaking rich and very numerous  The magnificent Hospital called  Holycross  on the South of this City at a Mile's Distance on the Road to  Southampton  is worth Notice it was founded by Bishop  Blois  The Church is in the Form of a Cross and has a large square Tower Every Traveller that knocks at the Door of this House in his Way and asks for it claims the Relief of a Piece of white Bread and a Cup of Beer and this Donation is still continued A Quantity of good Beer is set apart every Day to be given away and what is left is distributed to other Poor but none of it kept to next Day  How the Revenues of this Hospital which should maintain the Master and Thirty private Gentlemen whom they call  Fellows  but ought to call  Brothers  are now reduced to maintain only Fourteen while the Master lives in a Figure equal to the best Gentleman in the County would be well worth the Inquiry of a proper Visitor if such can be nam'd 'Tis a Thing worthy of Notice when publick Charities design'd for the Relief of the Poor are imbezzled by the Rich and turn'd to the Support of Luxury and Pride  An Infirmary is establish'd lately in this Town by voluntary Subscription after the laudable Examples of those of  St James  's  Westminster  and  St George  's at  HydePark Corner  and has met with great Success being principally owing to the Zeal and Pains of the Reverend Doctor  Alured Clarke  I have not room to say all that might be said on this Head and so must refer you to the Account given by the Doctor of the Rise and Progress Rules and Orders of this excellent Institution  I made an Excursion from  Winchester  to see the antient Town of  Romsey  noted for its delightful Situation having all round it Woods Cornfields Meadows and Pastures The River and Rivulets which are many have a rapid Course The Town was questionless  Roman  and its Name declares as much The Church is a noble Pile of Architecture arch'd with Stone in Form of a Cross with Semicircular Chapels in the upper Angles The Churches hereabouts called  Minsters  as  Wimburnminster  in the neighbouring County of  Dorset  were built by the  Saxon  Kings as soon as they became Christian At the Westend is the Piece of an old Wall probably belonging to the Nunnery built here by King  Edgar    Returning to  Winchester  we struck up Northwest and came to  Stokebridge  a poor sorry Borough Town noted for its Corruption in electing Members of Parliament and being a great Thoroughfare on the Southwestern Road it has however a great many good Inns and as well provided as any on that Road tho' it has no Market  The ingenious Sir  Richard Steele  once represented this Town in Parliament and tho' he was powerfully opposed yet carried his Election by a Stratagem which made all the Women of his Side Having made a great Entertainment for the Burgesses and their Wives and after having been very free and facetious among them he took up a large Apple and stuck it full of Guineas and declared it the Prize of that Man whose Wife should be first brought tobed after that Day Nine Months This occasioned a great deal of Mirth and what with the Entertainment and with the Hopes of getting the Prize the good Women prevailed on their Husbands to vote for Sir  Richard  whom they to this Day commemorate and as it is said once made a strong Push to get a standing Order of the Corporation made that no Man should be received as a Candidate for that Borough who did not offer himself upon the same Terms  Still rising Northward we arriv'd at  Andover  a Mayor Market and Borough Town and also noted for being a great Thoroughfare on the direct  Western  Road as well from  Newbury  to  Salisbury  as from  London  to  Taunton  and all the manufacturing Towns of  Somersetshire  whereby it is greatly inriched and is a thriving handsome well built and populous Town It is very healthy and pleasantly situated just on the Borders of those Downs which are commonly tho' not properly called  Salisburyplain  Near this Town is a Village called  Weyhill  where the open Down Country begins and here upon these Downs  is the famous  Weyhill  where the greatest Fair for Sheep in the Nation is kept and principally of Ewes for Storesheep for the Farmers of the Counties of  Berks Oxford Bucks Bedford Hertford Middlesex Kent Surrey  and  Sussex  who send for them to this Place  From  Andover  we bent our Way towards  Wiltshire  by  Quarleyhills  on the Westside of which are the Remains of a great Fortification consisting of two outward Trenches and other Works of great Strength and then entering that County and leaving  Luggershall  a small Hamlettown noted only for having been formerly the Castle of  Jeoffrey Fitzpiers  on the North of us we came to  Ambresbury  a very antient Town pretty large standing on the River  Avon  and having several good Inns but its Market is much decayed and almost discontinued It is said to have taken its Name from  Ambrius  who founded here a Monastery of  Benedictines  long before the coming in of the  Saxons  who destroyed it or from  Aurelius Ambrose  a  British  Prince who rebuilt it and fill'd it with Monks to pray for the Souls of those noble  Britons  who were slain by the Treachery of the perfidious  Hengist  the  Saxon  who massacred here of the antient  British  Nobility in cold Blood whom he had invited with their King  Vortigern  to meet him there without Arms to treat of a League of Amity and rejoice together  The treacherous  Saxon  sav'd only the King whom he obliged to give him near a Third of his Kingdom Eastward before he would set him at Liberty  The Monastery at  Ambresbury  was converted into a Nunnery and  Eleanor  King  Henry  III's Queen retir'd and dy'd here whose Example induced the Princess  Mary  King  Edward  's second Daughter and Thirteen Noblemens Daughters to take the Veil together in this House  The stupendous Piece of Antiquity called  Stonehenge  deserves our particular Notice and I shall therefore borrow from Dr  Stukeley  's Piece lately published intituled  Stonehenge a Temple restored to the British Druids  the following brief Account and Description of it referring to that elaborate Performance itself which well deserves the Attention of the Learned and Curious for a more satisfactory Account and for the Doctor's Reasons for his Hypothesis which we think he has made out with as much Certainty as the Nature of the Subject will admit  The  Wiltshire  Downs or  SalisburyPlain  as this Gentleman observes is one of the most delightful Spots in  Britain  and  Stonehenge  by the extravagant Grandeur of the Work has attracted the Admiration of all Ages Mr  Camden  himself says of it That he was grieved that the Founders of it could not be traced out but Dr  Stukeley  has very happily made it more than probable that it was a Temple of the  British  Druids and the Cathedral as it may be called the chief of all their Temples in this Island  The Stones of which it was composed are not factitious for that would have been a greater Wonder than to bring them together to the Place where they are but undoubtedly were brought Fifteen or Sixteen Miles off prodigious as they are from those called the Grey Weathers near  Abury  on  Marlborough  Downs all the greater Stones except the Altar being of that sort for that being designed to resist Fire is of a still harder kind 'tis a Composition of Crystals of red green and white Colours cemented by Nature with opaque Granules of flinty or stony Matter The Stone at the upper End of the Cell which is fallen down and broken in half the Doctor tells us weighs above Forty Tons and would require above Oxen to draw  it and yet is not the heaviest Stone neither Judge then what a stupendous Labour it was to bring together so many Miles such a Number as were used here and this has induced many inconsiderate People to imagine that the Founders had an Art of making Stone which has been lost for so many Ages  The present Name is  Saxon  tho' the Work is beyond all Comparison older signifying a hanging Rod or Pole  i e  a Gallows from the hanging Parts Architraves or rather Imposts and pendulous Rocks are still in  Yorkshire  called  Henges  But the antient Name was most probably the  Ambres  for which our learned Author to whom we refer gives very satisfactory Reasons and hence the adjacent Town of  Ambresbury  which I have taken Notice of has its Name  Stonehenge  stands not upon the Summit of a Hill but near it however at half a Mile Distance the Appearance is awful but as you come up the Avenue in the Northeast of it which Side is most perfect the Greatness of its Contour fills the Eye in an astonishing manner It is inclosed in a circular Ditch which having passed we ascend Thirtyfive Yards before we come at the Work The Stones are chissell'd and far from rude tho' not cut to that Preciseness as the Ruins in  Old Rome  and the Inside of them had more Pains taken with them then the Outside for so as our Author observes the polite Architects of the Eastern World were wont to do not like our  London  Builders who carve every Moulding and croud every Ornament they borrow from Books on the Outside of the publick Structures that they may the more commodiously gather the Dust and Smoke  When you enter the Building whether on Foot or Horseback and cast your Eyes around upon the yawning Ruins you are struck into an ecstatick Reverie  which no one can describe and they only can be sensible of who feel it Other Buildings fall by piecemeal but here a single Stone is a Ruin Yet is there as much undemolish'd as enables us sufficiently to recover its Form when in its most perfect State When we advance farther the dark Part of the ponderous Imposts over our Heads the Chasms of Sky between the Jambs of the Cell the odd Construction of the Whole and the Greatness of every Part surprises If you look upon the perfect Part you fansy intire Quarries mounted up into the Air if upon the rude Havock below you see as it were the Bowels of a Mountain turn'd inside out  The whole Work being of a circular Form is about Feet in Diameter from out to out The Intention of the Founders was this the whole Circle was to consist of Thirty Stones each Stone to be  This Cubit is the old  Hebrew Phoenician  or  Egyptian  Cubit and what the Founders of  Stonebenge  went by and amounts to Twenty Inches Fourfifths  English  Measure  Four Cubits broad each Interval Two Cubits Thirty times Four Cubits is twice Sixty Thirty times Two Cubits is Sixty so that thrice Sixty Cubits completes a Circle whose Diameter is Sixty A Stone being Four Cubits broad and Two thick is double the Interval which is a Square of Two Cubits Change the Places between the Stones and their Intervals and it will make a good Groundplot for a circular Portico of  Greek  or  Roman  Work Tho' these Bodies of Stone which are in the Nature of Imposts or Cornices never had or were intended to have any Mouldings upon them like  Greek  and  Roman  Works they are wrought perfectly plain and suitable to the Stones that support them and the Chisseling of the upright Stones is only above Ground for the Four or Five Feet in Length below Ground is left in the original natural Form The upright Stones are made very judiciously to diminish a little  every way so that attop they are but Three Cubits and a half broad and so much nearer as to suffer their Imposts to meet a little over the Heads of the Uprights both withinside and without by which means the Uprights are less liable to fall or swerve  It is to be fear'd some indiscreet People have been digging about the great Entrance with ridiculous Hopes of finding Treasure and so have loosen'd the chalky Foundation for the upper Edge of the Impost overhangs no less than Two Feet Seven Inches which is very considerable in a Height of Eighteen The whole Breadth at the Foundation is but Two Feet and an half and this noble Front is now chiefly kept up by the Masonry of the Mortaise and Tendon of the Imposts  The Contrivance of the Founders in making Mortaises and Tenons between the upright Stones and the Imposts is admirable but so contrary to any Practice of the  Romans  that it alone oversets their Claim to the Work These Tenons and Mortaifes of this outer Circle are round and fit one another very aptly They are Ten Inches and one half in Diameter and resemble half an Egg rather than an Hemisphere and so effectually keep both Uprights and Imposts from Luxation that they must have been thrown down with great Difficulty and Labour The whole Height of Upright and Impost is Ten Cubits and an half the Upright Nine the Impost over the grand Entrance is in its middle Length Eleven Feet Ten Inches and so is larger than the rest and it is also a little broader measuring on the Inside  Of the outer Circle of  Stonehenge  which in its Perfection consisted of Sixty Stones Thirty Uprights and Thirty Imposts there are Seventeen Uprights left standing Eleven of which remain continuous by the grand Entrance Five Imposts upon them One Upright at the Back of the Temple leans upon a Stone of the inner Circle There are  Six more lying upon the Ground whole or in Pieces so that Twentyfour out of Thirty are still visible at the Place There is but one Impost more in its proper Place and but Two lying upon the Ground so that Twentytwo are carry'd off Hence our Author infers this Temple was not defac'd when Christianity prevailed but that some rude Hands carried the Stones away for other Uses So much for the larger Circle of Stones with Imposts  As to the lesser Circle which never had any Imposts it is somewhat more than Eight Feet from the Inside of the outward one and consists of Forty lesser Stones forming with the outward Circles as it were a circular Portico a most beautiful Work and of a pretty Effect they are flat Parallelograms as those of the outer Circle and their general and design'd Proportion is Two Cubits or Two and an half as suitable Stones were found They are a Cubit thick and Four and one half high which is more than Seven Feet this was their stated Proportion being every way the half of the upper Uprights These Stones are of a harder Composition than the rest as the better to resist Violence as they are lesser and they have sufficient Fastenings in the Ground There are but Nineteen of the Forty left but Eleven of them are standing  in situ  Five in one Place contiguous Three in another Two in another  The Walk between these Two Circles which is Feet in Circumference is very noble and very delightful  The  Adytum  or Cell into which we may suppose none but the upper Order of Druids were to enter is composed of certain Compages of Stones which our Author calls  Trilithons  because made each of two upright Stones with an Impost at top and there are manifestly Five of these remaining Three of which are intire Two are ruin'd in some measure but the Stones remain  in situ  It is a magnificent  Niche Twentyseven Cubits long and as much broad measuring in the widest Place The Stones that compose it are really stupendous their Height Breadth and Thickness are enormous and to see so many of them placed together in a nice and critical Figure with Exactness to consider as it were not a Pillar of one Stone but a whole Wall a Side an End of a Temple of one Stone to view them curiously create such a Motion in the Mind as Words cannot express One very remarkable Particular in the Constitution of this  Adytum  has escap'd all Observers before our Author which is this as this Part is composed of Trilithons set two and two on each Side and one right before they rise in Height and Beauty of the Stones from the lower End of the  Adytum  to the upper End That is the two hithermost Trilithons corresponding or those next the grand Entrance on the Righthand and on the Left are exceeded in Height by the Two next in Order and those are exceeded by that behind the Altar in the upper End of this Choir and their Heights respectively are Thirteen Cubits Fourteen Cubits Fifteen Cubits  The Imposts of these are all of the same Height and Ten Cubits may be supposed their medium Measure in Length The Artifice of the Tenons and Mortaises of these Trilithons and their Imposts what Conformity they bear to that of the outer Circle is exceedingly pretty every thing being done very geometrically and as would best answer every Purpose from plain and simple Principles and 'tis wonderful that in the Management of such prodigious Stones as these are fix'd in the Ground and ramm'd in like Posts there is not more Variation in the Height Distance  c  Of these greater Stones of the  Adytum  as is observed before there are none wanting being all on the Spot Ten Uprights and Five Cornices The  Trilithon first on the Lefthand is intire  in situ  but vastly decay'd especially the Cornice in which such deep Holes are corroded that in some Places the Daws make their Nests in them The next Trilithon on the Left is intire composed of three most beautiful Stones The Cornice happening to be of a very durable  English  Marble has not been much impair'd by the Weather Our Author took a Walk on the Top of it but thought it a frightful Situation The Trilithon of the upper End was an extraordinary Beauty but probably thro' the Indiscretion of some body digging between them and the Altar the noble Impost is dislodg'd from its airy Seat and fallen upon the Altar where its huge Bulk lies unfractur'd The Two Uprights that supported it are the most delicate Stones of the whole Work They were our Author thinks above Thirty Feet long and well chissell'd finely taper'd and proportion'd in their Dimensions That Southward is broken in two lying upon the Altar The other still stands intire but leans upon one of the Stones of the inward Oval the Rootend or unhewn Part of both is raised somewhat above Ground The Trilithon towards the West is intire except that some of the End of the Impost is fallen clean off and all the upper Edge is very much diminish'd by time The last Trilithon on the Righthand of the Entrance into the  Adytum  has suffer'd much The outer Upright being the Jamb of the Entrance is still standing the other Upright and Impost are both fallen forwards into the Adytum and broke each into Three Pieces as supposed from digging near it That which is standing has a Cavity in it which Two or Three Persons may  it in warm from the Weather  Stonehenge  is composed of Two Circles and Two Ovals respectively concentrick The Stones that form these Ovals rise in Height as nearer the upper End of the  Adytum  and their mediate Measure is  Four Cubits and Four Palms They are of a much harder Kind than the larger Stones in the lesser Circle the Founders no doubt intending that their lesser Bulk should be compensated by Solidity Of these there are only Six remaining upright the Stumps of Two are left on the Southside by the Altar one lies behind the Altar dug up or thrown down by the Fall of the Upright there One or Two were probably thrown down by the Fall of the Upright of the first Trilithon on the Righthand a Stump of another remains by the Upright there still standing  The whole Number of Stones may be thus computed The great Oval consists of Ten Uprights the inner with the Altar of Twenty the great Circle of Thirty the inner of Forty which are One hundred upright Stones Five Imposts of the great Oval Thirty of the great Circle the Two Stones on the Bank of the Area the Stone lying within the Entrance of the Area and that standing without there seems to be another lying on the Ground by the  Vallum  of the Court directly opposite to the Entrance of the Avenue all added together make just One hundred and forty Stones the Number of which  Stonehenge  a whole Temple is composed Behold the Solution of the mighty Problem the magical Spell which has so long perplex'd the Vulgar is broken They think it an ominous thing to count the true Number of the Stones and whoever does so shall  certainly  die after it  As to the Altar it is laid toward the upper End of the  Adytum  at present flat on the Ground and squeez'd into it as it were by the Weight of the Ruins upon it 'Tis a kind of blue coarse Marble such as comes from  Derbyshire  and laid upon Tombs in our Churches and Churchyards Our Author believes its Breadth is Two Cubits Three Palms and that its first intended Length was Ten Cubits equal to the Breadth of the Trilithon before which it lies  But it is very difficult to come at its true Length 'Tis Twenty Inches thick a just Cubit and has been squar'd It lies between the two Centres that of the Compasses and that of the String leaving a convenient Space quite round it no doubt as much as was necessary for this Ministration  The Heads of Oxen Deer and other Beasts have been found upon digging in and about  Stonehenge  undoubted Reliques of Sacrifices together with Woodashes Mr  Camden  says Mens Bones have been found hereabouts he means in the adjacent Barrows and such our Author saw thrown out by the Rabbets which have been brought hither of late Years and by their burrowing threaten these noble Ruins as the greedy Plough more and more invades the neighbouring Plain  But eternally as he observes is to be lamented the Loss of that Tablet of Tin which was found at this Place in the Time of  Henry  VIII inscribed with many Letters but in so strange a Character that neither Sir  Thomas Elliot  a learned Antiquary nor Mr  Lilly  First High Master of St  Paul  's School could make any thing out of and which no doubt was a Memorial of the Founders written by the Druids and had it been preserv'd till now would have been an invaluable Curiosity  In the Year as they were plowing by the Barrows about  NormantonDitch  they found so large a Quantity of excellent Pewter as at a low Price they sold for Five Pounds There are several of these Ditches being very narrow which run across the Downs which perhaps are Boundaries of Hundreds Parishes  c  These Pewter Plates might very possibly have been Tablets with Inscriptions but falling into such rude Hands they could no more discern the Writing than interpret it No doubt says Dr  Stukeley  this was some of the old  British Stannum  which the  Tyrian Hercules  surnam'd  Melcarthus    first brought  ex Cassiteride Insula  or  Britain  Which  Hercules  lived in  Abraham  's Time or soon after  Mr  Webb  tells us the Duke of  Buckingham  dug about  Stonehenge  perhaps much to the Prejudice of the Work Mr  Webb  also did the like and found what he imagined was the Corner of a  Thuribulum    Mr  Hayward  late Owner of  Stonehenge  likewise dug about it and found Heads of Oxen and other Beasts Bones and nothing else  Dr  Stukeley  himself in dug on the Inside of the Altar about the middle Four Feet along the Edge of the Stone Six Feet forward toward the middle of the  Adytum  at a Foot deep he came to the solid Chalk mix'd with Flints which had never been stirr'd The Altar was exactly a Cubitthick  i e  Twenty Inches Fourfifths but broken in Two or Three Pieces by the ponderous Masses of the Imposts and one upright Stone of that Trilithon which stood at the upper End of the  Adytum  being fallen upon it Hence appears the Commodiousness of the Foundation for this huge Work They dug Holes in the solid Chalk which would of itself keep up the Stones as firm as if a Wall was built round them and no doubt but they ramm'd up the Interstices with Flints But he says he had too much Regard to the Work to dig anywhere near the Stones He took up an Ox's Tooth above Ground without the  Adytum  on the Righthand of the lowermost Trilithon Northward  The Time our Author assigns for the building of  Stonehenge  is not long after  Cambyses  's Invasion of  Egypt  when he committed such horrid Outrages there and made such dismal Havock with the Priests and Inhabitants in general that they dispersed themselves to all the Parts of the World some as far as the  EastIndies  and some it is not questioned as far Westward into  Britain  and introduced some of their Learning Arts and Religion among the  Druids    and perhaps had a Hand in this very Work the only one where the Stones are chissell'd all other Works of theirs being of rude Stones untouch'd of the Tool exactly after the  Patriarchal  and  Jewish  Mode and therefore older than this and this Conjecture is the more probable because at the time mention'd the  Phoenician  Trade was at its Height which afforded a readier Conveyance hither This was before the second Temple at  Jerusalem  was built before the  Grecians  had any History  For farther Particulars of this stupendous Work and other curious Matters relating and adjacent to it such as its Antiquity before the Time of the  Belgae  the  Romans  the  Saxons  and  Danes  of the  Wansdike  of  Vespasian  's Camp at  Ambresbury  the Introduction of the  Druids  into  Britain  which he puts about  Abraham  's Time its antient Name the  Ambres  the Water Vases of  Stonehenge  the Avenue to it the  Cursus  we must refer our Readers to the Work itself having already exceeded the narrow Bounds to which the Nature of our Design confines us But this we may add that doubtless they had some Method in former Days in foreign Countries as well as here to move heavier Weights than we now find practicable How else did  Solomon  's Workmen build the Battlement or additional Wall to support the Precipice of  MountMoriah  on which the Temple was erected which was all built of  Parian  Marble each Stone being Forty Cubits long Fourteen broad and Eight Cubits thick And so much for this celebrated Temple of  Stonehenge    We shall now proceed to give some Account of the famous Barrows on these Downs and we shall borrow from the same learned Author the following curious Particulars relating to them  The Tops of all the Hills or rather easy Elevations round  Stonehenge  are in a manner cover'd over with th  se Barrows which make an agreeable  Appearance adorning the bare Downs with their Figures This Ring of Barrows however reaches no farther than till you lose Sight of the Temple as we now make no doubt to call  Stonehenge  or thereabouts Many from the great Number of these sepulchral  Tumuli  here injudiciously conclude that there have been great Battles upon the Plain and that the Slain are buried there but they are really no other than Family Buryingplaces set near this Temple for the same Reason as we bury in Churchyards and consecrated Ground  We may readily count Fifty at a time in Sight from the Place especially in the Evening when the sloping Rays of the Sun shine on the Ground beyond them They are most of them of a very elegant Belllike Form and done with great Nicety in general they are always upon elevated Ground and in Sight of the Temple as we have said for they all regard it and are assuredly the single Sepulchres of Kings and great Personages buried during a considerable Space of Time and in Peace There are many Groups of them together as if Family Burialplaces and the Variety in them seems to indicate some Preeminence in the Persons interred Most of them have little Ditches around in many is a circular Ditch Cubits in Diameter with a very small  Tumulus  in the Centre Sixty or even Cubits is a very common Diameter in the large Barrows Often they are set in Rows and equidistant so as to produce a regular and pretty Appearance and with some particular Regard to the Parts of the Temple the Avenues or the  Cursus  Upon every Range of Hills quite round  Stonehenge  are successive Groups of Barrows for some Miles and even that nam'd  Kingbarrow  by Lord  Pembroke  's Park Wall at  Wilton  which our Author calls the  Tomb of  Carvilius  is set within View of  Stonehenge    In the late Lord  Pembroke  opened a Barrow in order to find the Position of the Body observed in those early Days He pitched upon one of the double Barrows where two are inclosed in one Ditch He made a Section from the Top to the Bottom an intire Segment from Centre to Circumference The Composition was good Earth quite thro' except a Coat of Chalk of about Two Feet thick covering it quite over under the Turf Hence it appears that the Method of making these Barrows was to dig up the Turf for a great Space round till the Barrow was brought to its intended Bulk then with the Chalk dug out of the invironing Ditch they powder'd it all over And the Notion of Sanctity annexed to them forbad People trampling on them till perfectly settled and turfed over whence the Neatness of their Form to this Day At the Top or Centre of this Barrow not above Three Feet under the Surface my Lord found the Skeleton of the Interred perfect of a reasonable Size the Head lying Northward towards  Stonehenge    The Year following by my Lord's Order Dr  Stukeley  began upon another double Barrow He began upon the lesser and made a large Cut on the Top from East to West After the Turf he came to the Layer of Chalk as before then fine Garden Mould About Three Feet below the Surface a Layer of Flints humouring the Convexity of the Barrow which are gathered from the Surface of the Downs in some Places especially where it has been ploughed This being about a Foot thick rested on a Layer of soft Mould another Foot in which was inclosed an Urn full of Bones The Urn was of unbaked Clay of a dark reddish Colour crumbled into pieces It had been rudely wrought with small  Mouldings round the Verge and other circular Chanels on the Outside with several Indentions between made with a pointed Tool The Bones had been burnt and crouded all together in a little Heap not so much as a Hatcrown would contain the Collarbone and one side of the Underjaw remaining very intire It appears to have been a Girl of about Fourteen Years old by their Bulk and the great Quantity of Female Ornaments mixed with the Bones as great Numbers of glass Beads of all Sorts and of divers Colours most yellow one black many single many in long Pieces notched between so as to resemble a String of Beads and these were generally of a blue Colour There were many of Amber of all Shapes and Sizes flat Squares long Squares round oblong little and great likewise many of Earth of different Shapes Magnitude and Colour some little and white many large and flattish like a Button others like a Pully but all had Holes to run a String thro' either thro' their Diameter or Sides Many of the Button Sort seem'd to have been covered with Metal there being a Rim worked in them wherein to turn the Edge of the Covering One of these was covered with a thin Film of pure Gold These were the young Lady's Ornaments and had all undergone Fire so that what would easily consume fell topieces as soon as handled much of the Amber burnt half thro' this Person was a Heroine for we found the Head of her Javelin in Brass At Bottom are two Holes for the Pin that fastened it to the Staff besides there was a sharp Bodkin round at one End square at the other where it went into the Handle Our Author preserved whatever is permanent of these Trinkets but recompos'd the Ashes of the illustrious Defunct and covered them with Earth leaving visible Marks at Top of the Barrow having been open'd to dissuade any other  from again disturbing them and this was his Practice in all the rest  He then opened the next Barrow to it inclosed in the same Ditch which he supposed the Husband or Father of this Lady At Inches deep the Mould  ng mixed with Chalk he came to the intire  ton of a Man the Skull and all the Bones  ingly rotten and perished thro' Length of Time tho' this was a Barrow of the latest Sort as he  ctured The Body lay North and South the Head to the North as that Lord  Pembroke  ed  Next he went Westward to a Group of Barrows  Stonehenge  bears Eastnortheast Here is a large Barrow ditch'd about but of an antient Make On that Side next  Stonehenge  are Ten lesser small  were crouded together South of the great  Barrow larger than those of the Gr  up but not equalling the first it would seem that a Man and his Wife were buried in the Two larger and that the rest were of their Children or Dependents One of the small ones Cubits in Diameter he cut thro' with a Pit Nine Feet in Diameter to the Surface of the natural Chalk in the Centre of the Barrow where was a little Hole cut A Child's Body as it seems had been burnt here and covered up in that Hole but thro' Length of Time consumed From Three Feet deep he found much Woodashes soft and black as Ink some little Bits of an Urn and black and red Earth very rotten some small Lumps of Earth red as Vermilion some Flints burnt thro' toward the Bottom a great Quantity of Ashes and burnt Bones From this Place he counted Barrows in Sight  Going from hence more Southerly is a circular dishlike Cavity Cubits in Diameter dug in the Chalk like a Barrow reversed 'Tis near a great Barrow the least of the Southwestern Group This  Cavity is Seven Feet deep in the Middle extremely well turn'd and out of it no doubt the adjacent Barrow is dug The Use of it seems to have been a Place for sacrificing and feasting in Memory of the Dead as was the antient Custom 'Tis all overgrown with that pretty Shrub  Erica Vulgaris  then in Flower and smelling like Honey He made a large cross Section in its Centre upon the Cardinal Points and found nothing but a Bit of red earthen Pot  He then dug up one of those he calls  Druids  Barrows a small  Tumulus  inclosed in a large circular Ditch  Stonehenge  bears hence Northeast He made a cross Section Ten Feet each way Three Feet broad over its Centre upon the Cardinal Points At length he found a squarish Hole cut in the solid Chalk in the Centre of the  Tumulus  it was Three Feet and an half  i e  Two Cubits long and near Two Feet broad  i e  One Cubit pointing to  Stonehenge  directly It was a Cubit and an half deep from the Surface This was the  Domus exilis Plutonia  covered with artificial Earth not above a Foot thick from the Surface In this little Grave he found all the burnt Bones of a Man but no Signs of an Urn The Bank of the circular Ditch is on the Out  ide and is Cubits broad The Ditch is Six Cubits broad the  Druid  's Staff the Area is Cubits in Diameter The Whole  He opened another of these of like Dimensions next to that Lord  Pembroke  first opened South of  Stonehenge  and found a burnt Body in a Hole in the Chalk as before  In some other Barrows he opened were found large burnt Bones of Horses and Dogs along with human also of other Animals as seem'd of Fowl Hares Boars Deer Goats or the like and in a great and very flat oldfashioned Barrow West from  Stonehenge  among such Matters he found Bits of  red and blue Marble Chippings of the Stones of the Temple so that probably the Interred was one of the Builders  Homer  tells of  Achilles  slaying Horses and Dogs at the Funeral of his Friend  Patroclus    Lord  Pembroke  told the Doctor of a Brass Sword dug up in a Barrow here which was sent to  Oxford  In that very old Barrow near  Little Ambresbury  was found a very large Brass Weapon of Pounds Weight like a Poleax said to be given to Colonel  Wyndham  In the great long Barrow farthest North from  Stonehenge  which our Author supposes to be an  Archdruid's  was found one of those Brass Instruments called  Celts  which he thinks belong'd to the  Druids  wherewith they cut off the Misleto Mr  Stallard  of  Ambresbury  gave it to Lord  Burlington  now in Sir  Hans Sloane  's Cabinet Inches long They dug a Cell in a Barrow East of  Ambresbury  and it was inhabited for some time There they saw all the Bones of a Horse We find evidently adds the Doctor these antient Nations had the Custom of burning their dead Bodies probably before the Name of  Rome  So  Lacrymatories  we read of in Scripture antienter than  Greek  or  Roman  Times  Psalm  lvi  Salisbury  Plains are certainly the most charming that can anywhere be seen The numerous Flocks of Sheep all around which way soever we turn are a fine Sight 'tis ordinary for these Flocks to contain from to each and several private Farmers hereabouts have Two or Three such Flocks  But 'tis more remarkable still how a great Part of these Downs comes by a new Method of Husbandry not only to be made arable but to bear plentiful Crops of Wheat tho' never known to our Ancestors to be capable of any such Thing nay they would probably have laughed at any one that had gone about to plough up the wild Downs and Hills which they thought only fit for Sheepwalks but Experience  has made the present Age wiser and more skilful in Husbandry for by only folding the Sheep upon those Lands after they are turn'd up with the Plough which generally goes within Three or Four Inches of the solid Rock of Chalk they become abundantly fruitful and bear very good Wheat as well as Rye and Barley I shall say more of this when I come to speak of the same Practice farther in the Country  This plain open Country continues in Length from  Winchester  to  Salisbury  Miles from thence to  Dorchester  Miles thence to  Weymouth  six Miles so that they lie near Miles in Length and Breadth they reach also in some Places fron to Miles Those who would make any practicable Guess at the Number of Sheep which usually feed on these Downs may take it from a Calculation made as I was told at  Dorchester  that there were Sheep fed within the Circumference of Six Miles around that Town  As we passed this open plain Country we saw the Ruins of a great many old  Roman  and  British  Camps and other Remains of the antient Inhabitants of this Kingdom and of their Wars Battles Entrenchments Encampments Buildings and other Fortifications which are indeed very agreeable to a Traveller that has read the History of the Country  Old Sarum  which is the next Place we come to is as remarkable as any of these where there is a double Entrenchment with a deep Graff or Ditch to either of them 'Tis said it was a  Roman  Station and the antient  Sorbiodunum  It was deserted in King  Henry  III's Time for want of Water when the Inhabitants founded  New Sarum  The old City is of an orbicular Form erected on one of the most elegant Designs imaginable It was first a Fortress of the antient  Britons  The Prospect of this Place is at present very august and would have afforded us  a most noble Sight when in Perfection In the Angle to the Northwest stood the Cathedral and Episcopal Palace The City fills up the Summit of an high and steep Hill near the Bottom of which runs the River  Avon  Here Synods and  British  Parliaments have formerly been held and hither the States of the Kingdom were summoned to swear Fealty to  William  I In this City was the Palace of the  British  and  Saxon  Kings and of the  Roman  Emperors Near it is one Farmhouse and that is all which is left of this antient City yet this is called the Borough of  Old Sarum  and sends Two Members to Parliament who are chosen by the Proprietors of certain Lands  Whom  those Members can justly say  they represent  would however be hard for them to answer  Salisbury  is a large wellbuilt and pleasant City and the Founders of it seemed to have run from one Extreme to another for as the old City wanted Water this has rather too much the Water running thro' the Middle of every Street which I think does not add to the Beauty of the Town but just the contrary for it keeps the Streets always dirty full of Wet and Filth and Weeds even in the Middle of Summer  The City lies at the Confluence of Two Rivers the  Avon  and the  Willy  each of them singly a considerable River but very large when joined together and yet much larger when they receive the  Nadder  a third River which joins them near  Clarendon  Park about Three Miles below the City when with a deep Chanel and a Current less rapid they run down to  Christchurch  where they empty themselves into the Sea From that Town upwards to within Two Miles of  Salisbury  they are made navigable but the Strength of the Stream would not permit to make them so up to the City  Salisbury  and all the County of  Wilts  are full of a great Variety of Manufactures and those too of the most considerable in  England  as the Cloathing Trade and that of Flanels Druggets and also several other Sorts of Manufactures of which in their Place  Salisbury  has in particular Two remarkable Manufactures that flourish in it which employ the Poor all around namely fine Flanels and Long Cloths for the  Turkey  Trade called  Salisbury Whites    The Close adjacent to the Cathedral in which live the Canons and Prebendaries is so large and wellbuilt that it looks like a fine City of itself  The Cathedral is famous for the Height of its Spire which is without Exception the highest and the handsomest in  England  being from the Ground Feet and yet the Walls so exceeding thin that at the Upperpart of the Spire upon a View made by the late Sir  Christopher Wren  the Wall was found to be less than five Inches thick upon which a Consultation was had whether the Spire or at least the Upperpart of it should be taken down it being supposed to have received some Damage by the great Storm in the Year but it was resolved in the Negative and Sir  Christopher  ordered it to be strengthened with Bands of Iron Plates which have effectually secured it and I have heard some of the best Architects say it is stronger now than when it was first built  They tell us here long Stories of the great Art used in laying the first Foundation of this Church the Ground being marshy and wet occasioned by the Chanels of the Rivers that it was laid upon Piles according to some and upon Woolpacks according to others But this is not to be believed by those who know that the whole Country is one Rock of Chalk even from the Tops of the highest Hills to the Bottom of the deepest Rivers And the Foundation  of Woolpacks is no doubt allegorical and has respect to the Woollen Trade  This Church was begun by Bishop  Poore  continu'd by  Robert Bingham  and  William  of  York  and finished by  Giles de Brideport  Bishop of this See all in the Space of Years The Model is after the Figure of a Cross and it cost an immense Sum of Money but it must be acknowledged that the Inside of the Work is not answerable in the Decoration of Things to the Workmanship without The Painting in the Choir is mean and more like the ordinary Method of a common Drawingroom or Tavernpainting than that of a Church The Carving is good but there is very little of it and it is rather a fine Church than finely set off  But it now makes a better Appearance than it has done having very lately been repaired by the Contributions of the Bishop and Prebendaries set on foot by Bishop  Sherlock  who it seems thought that the Dignitaries ought to support what supported them and that all they got by the Church was not designed merely to make or inrich their Families  The ordinary Boast of this Building in the following Verses must not be omitted  As many Days as in One Year there be  So many Windows in One Church we see  As many Marble Pillars there appear  As there are Hours throughout the fleeting Year  As many Gates as Moons One Year do view  Strange Tale to tell yet not more strange than true  Some of the Windows which escaped the Fury of the Zealots of are well painted  There are some very fine Monuments in this Church particularly in that they call the  Virgin Mary's Chapel  behind the Altar is a noble Monument for a late Duke and Duchess of  Somerset  with  their Pourtraits at full Length The late Duchess of  Somerset  of the  Piercy  Family also her Daughter the Marchioness of  Caermarthen  and a second Son of her Grace both by the present Duke are likewise interred here  The Figure of one  Bennet  who endeavoured to imitate our Saviour in Fasting Forty Days and Forty Nights as is there represented carried his Point so far that being reduced to a Skeleton he fell a Victim to his presumptuous and enthusiastick Folly The Bodies of the Bishops  Jewell Uvall Chest  were also interred here Here is likewise a Monument to the beneficent Dr  Seth Ward  Bishop of this See who founded amidst other Benefactions which we shall take notice of in  Hertfordshire  a handsome College for the Widows of Ten Ministers allowing to each  l per Annum  and which has been since obliged to Dr  Gilbert Burnet  Bishop of this See  They shew you also the Monument of the Lord  Stourton  in the Reign of  Philip  and  Mary  which is made remarkable by a particular Incident as follows  This Lord  Stourton  being guilty of a Murder which was aggravated with very bad Circumstances could not obtain the usual Grace of the Crown to be beheaded but Queen  Mary  positively ordered that like a common Malefactor he should die at the Gallows After he was executed his Friends desiring to have him bury'd at  Salisbury  the Bishop would not consent that he should be buried in the Cathedral unless as a farther Mark of Infamy they would submit to this Condition  viz  That the silken Halter in which he was hanged should be placed over his Grave in the Church as a Monument of his Crime which was accordingly done and there it is to be seen at this Day  The putting this Halter up here was not so wonderful to me as it was that the Posterity of that  Lord who remained in good Rank some Time after should never prevail to have that Mark of Infamy taken from the Tomb of their Ancestor  The Cloister is Feet square the inner Cioister Feet wide with Arches on each Side the Top vaulted and covered with Lead Over the East Walk of the Cloister is a spacious Library but not overwell stocked with Books The Chapterhouse is Octagon and is Feet in Circumference the Roof bearing all upon one small Marble Pillar in the Centre which seems so feeble that it is hardly to be imagined it can be any great Support to it which makes it the more curious and indeed I believe it is hardly to be matched in  Europe    The Corporation of  Sarum  have lately purchased a very fine Original Piece of Painting of her late Majesty Queen  Anne  drawn by the celebrated  Dahl  and have put it up in the Councilchamber of the City This Picture formerly belonged to the Society of Gentlemen all Members of Parliament known by the Name of the  October Club  and was set up in the great Room belonging to the  Bell  now  Crown  Tavern in  Westminster  where they used to meet till the Death of Queen  Anne    In an Act passed for the better Repairing and Paving the Highways Streets and Watercourses within this City and for Enlightening the Streets Lanes and Passages and better regulating the Nightly Watch  From hence directing my Course to the Seaside in pursuit of my first Design of viewing the whole Coast of  England  I left the great Road and went down the Eastside of the River towards  NewForest  and  Lymington  and here I saw the antient House and Seat of  Clarendon  which gives Title to the Earl of that Name This Place should be called  Clorendon  from the memorable  Roman  Camp half a Mile off the Park near the  Roman  Road made or repaired by  Constantius Chlorus  Father of  Constantine  It is a beautiful Fortification of a round Form upon a dry chalky Hill Within is a circular Ditch supposed to be a less Sort of Camp for the Summer The Park is a sweet and beautiful Spot Here King  John  built a Palace where several Parliaments have been held Part of the Fabrick is still left tho' they have for many Years been pulling it down The Meterials are chiefly Flint and it was built upon the Side of an Hill but no way fortified tho' it took up much Ground This Palace is called the  Manor  and from it lies a subterraneous Passage to the  Queen's Manor  Between the Camp and the Park was a  Roman  Road from  Sorbiodunum  or  Old Sarum  to  Winchester    But this being a large County and full of memorable Branches of Antiquity and modern Curiosity I made several little Excursions from this beautiful Spot to view the Northern Parts of the County  I have mentioned that this County is generally a vast continued Body of high chalky Hills whose Tops spread themselves into fruitful and pleasant Downs and Plains upon which great Flocks of Sheep are fed  c  But the Reader is desired to observe these Hills and Plains are most beautifully intersected and cut thro' by the Course of divers pleasant and profitable Rivers along and near the Banks of which there always is a Chain of fruitful Meadows and rich Pastures and those interspersed with a great many pleasant Towns Villages and Houses and among them many of considerable Magnitude so that while you view the  Downs  and think the Country wild and uninhabited yet when you come to descend into these Vales you are surprised with the most pleasant and fertile Country in  England    No less than Four of these Rivers meet all together at or near the City of  Salisbury  the Waters  of Three of which run thro' the Streets of the City  viz  the  Nadder  the  Willy  and the  Avon  The  Nadder  rises near the End of the  Blow Mill Course  and passes by  Chilmark  a pleasant Village noted for its Quarries of very good white Stone which rises in many Dimensions insomuch that there is now a single Stone lying over the Mouth of the Quarry like an Architrave full Feet long in Thickness and perfectly without Flaw The  Willy  rises about  Warminster  runs by  Yarnbury  a vast  Roman  Camp where some distinguish  Vespasian  's Name a great semicircular Work at the Entrance overagainst which on the other Side the  Willy  is another Camp then running by  Orchestra  remarkable for a Kind of Grass Feet in Length with which they fatten Hogs it gives Name to  Wilton  and forms the Canal before the Front of  Wilton  House and then joining the  Nadder  runs thro' the Gardens at the End of the Avenue The  Avon  rises from under a great Ridge of Hills which divide  Wiltshire  into North and South adorn'd with the  Wansdike  It passes Southward thro' a great Number of Villages to  Ambresbury    What is most worth a Man of Curiosity's seeing in this County is  Wilton  House It is situated in a pleasant Vale having  Wilton  Town on one Side and a spacious Park on the other  The Building was begun in the Reign of  Hen  VIII The great Quadrangle was finished in the Time of  Edward  VI and the Porch was designed by  Hans Holbein  The Hallside being burnt down some Years ago was rebuilt by the late  Thomas  Earl of  Pembroke  then Lord HighAdmiral of  England  in a very noble and sumptuous manner The other Parts rebuilt by the first  Philip  Earl of  Pembroke  were all designed by the famous  Inigo Jones  and finished by him in the Year  The Canal before the House lies parallel with the Road and receives into it the whole River  Willy  or at least is able to do so it may indeed be said that the River is made into a Canal When we come into the Courtyards before the House there are several Pieces of Antiquity to entertain the Curious as particularly a noble Column of Porphyry with a Marble Statue of  Venus  on the Top of it which as they told me is Feet high and of excellent Workmanship and that it came last from  Candia  but formerly from  Alexandria    As the late Earl of  Pembroke  was a Nobleman of great Learning beyond most Men of his high Rank and a Master of Antiquity he took Delight in collecting such valuable Pieces of Painting and Sculpture as made  Wilton  House a perfect  Museum  or Receptacle of Rarities and we meet with several Things there which are to be found nowhere else in the World I shall particularize but a few for a Volume might be employ'd in a full Description of them  The Piece of our Saviour's washing his Disciples Feet which they shew you in one of the first Rooms you go into is admirable At the Foot of the great Staircase is a  Bacchus  as large as the Life done in fine  Peloponnesian  Marble carrying a young  Bacchus  on his Arm the young one eating Grapes and shewing by his Countenance he is pleased with the Taste of them One ought to stop every Two Steps of this Staircase as we go up to contemplate the vast Variety of Pictures that cover the Walls and of some of the best Masters in  Europe  and yet this is but an Introduction to what is beyond them  The great Geometrical Staircase itself is deservedly admired and was the first of this Kind in  England  and the rich and magnificent Doorcase can hardly be parallell'd  'Tis universally acknowledged that the grand Apartment is one of the noblest Pieces of Architecture that has been hitherto produced particularly the  Salon  which is Feet long high and broad and when you are enter'd these grand Apartments such Variety strikes upon you every Way that you scarce know to which Hand to turn yourself first On one Side you see several Rooms filled with Paintings all so curious and various that it is with Reluctance you leave them and looking another way you are called off by a vast Collection of Busts and Pieces of the greatest Antiquity of the Kind both  Greek  and  Roman    In one End of the grand Room is the celebrated Familypicture by  Vandyke  Feet long and Feet high containing Figures as big as the Life which rather appear as so many real Persons than the Production of Art and all the other Pictures there are of the same incomparable Hand It would be endless to describe the whole Set of the Familypictures which take up this Room unless we would enter into the Rooftree of the Family and set down a Genealogical Line of the whole House  After this fine Range of Beauties are seen we are far from being at an End of our Surprize there are three or four Rooms still upon the same Floor filled with Wonders nothing can be finer than the Pictures themselves nothing more surprising than the Number of them At length you descend the Backstairs which are large tho' not like the other where not a Hand's Breadth is left vacant between the Pictures and even the upper Rooms have some very good Pieces in them  In most of the Apartments are Marble Chimneypieces of the most exquisite Workmanship all carved in  Italy  with many curious Statues Basso Relievo's and Pictures of the most famous Masters  The  Loggio  in the Bowlinggreen which has Pillars beautifully rusticated and is inriched with Niches and Statues the  Grotto  the Front of which is curiously carved without as it is all Marble within and has black Pillars of the  Ionic  Order with Capitals of white Marble and Four fine Basso Relievo's from  Florence  the Stables and other Offices are all Beauties in their Kind which would tire Description  The Collection of Headpieces Coats of Mail and other Armour for both Horse and Man are also a Curiosity They shew those of King  Henry  VIII  Edward  VI and of an Earl of  Pembroke  nicknamed  Black Jack  which he wore when he besieged and took  Bulloign  in  France  being the General who commanded in chief under the King they are very curious and imboss'd Twelve other complete Suits of Armour of extraordinary Workmanship are also there the rest being about are only for common Horsemen  The Garden Front is justly esteemed one of the best Pieces of the renowned  Inigo Jones  and is Feet long  The Gardens are on the South of the House and extend themselves beyond the River a Branch of which runs thro' one Part of them and still South of the Gardens is the great Park which reaches beyond the Vale the View opens to the great Down which is properly called by way of Distinction  Salisburyplain  and leads from the City of  Salisbury  to  Shaftsbury  Here also his Lordship has a  Harewarren  as 'tis called tho' improperly It has indeed been a Sanctuary for the Hares for many Years but the Gentlemen complain that it mars their Game for that as soon as they put up a Hare  for their Sport  if it be anywhere within two or three Miles away she runs for the Warren and there is an End of their Pursuit On the other hand  it makes all the Countrymen turn Poachers and destroy the Hares by what Means they can The present Earl of  Pembroke  who as his Father had has also a fine Taste in Architecture has made a further Improvement with regard to Prospect at this noble House throwing down the Walls of the Garden and making instead of them the newly introduced Hawhaw Walls which afford a boundless View all around the Country from every Quarter His Lordship has also built a most magnificent Bridge over the River in his Garden which is esteemed the principal Ornament without Doors of this noble Seat  From this pleasant and agreeable Place I returned to  Clarendon  The Road from  Wilton  to  Shaftsbury  called  The Ten Mile Course  is a fine Ridge of Downs continued upon the Southern Bank of the River  Nadder  with a sweet Prospect to the Right and Left all the way over the Towns and the Country on both Sides The late Earl of  Pembroke  has placed a number'd Stone at every Mile for the Benefit of Travellers Between the th and th Mile is a pretty large Camp called  Chiselbury  probably  Roman  in the Decline of the Empire At the End of this Course are three or four  Celtic  Barrows In this Hill is a Quarry of Stone very full of Sea Shells Not far off in the Parish of  Tisbury  near  Wardercastle  is a great Entrenchment in a Wood which was probably a  British  Town near the  Nadder    Returning we see upon the highest Eminence which overlooks  Wilton  and the fertile Valley at the Union of the  Nadder  and  Willy  the noted Place called  Kingbarrow  mentioned  p  This is certainly  Celtick  says Dr  Stukeley  and with great Probability the very Tomb of that  Carvilius  who attacked  Caesar  's Seacamp in order to divert his renown'd Enemy from his close Pursuit of  Cassibelan    This Prince is supposed to have kept his Royal Residence at  Carvilium  now  Wilton  near which Place King  Edgar's  Queen spent the latter Part of her Life in a religious Retirement and for that Purpose built a House there  The Downs and Plains in this Part of  England  being so open and the Surface so little subject to Alteration there are more Remains of Antiquity to be seen upon them than in other Places and as they tell us no less than Threeandfifty antient Incampments or Fortifications in this one County some of which are very visible and are of different Forms and erected by different Nations as  British Danish Saxon  and  Roman  particularly at  Ebbdown Burywood Oldburghhill Cummerford Roundwaydown St Anne'shill Brattoncastle Clayhill Stourntonpark Whitecolehall Battlebury Scrathbury Yanesbury Frippsbury Suthburyhill Ambresbury  mentioned before  Great Bodwyn Easterley Merdon Aubery Martenscilhill Barburycastle  c At  Aubery  or  Aukbury  in particular on the East Side of the  Avon  by  Great Dornford  is a very large Camp covering the whole Top of a Hill On the other Side of the River a little higher up is  Vespasian  's Camp called  The Walls  Near these are two other Camps which seem Remains of  Vespasian  's Victories and intimate that he subdued the Country by Inches  North of these is  Martin'shallhill  a vast Stationary  Roman  Camp On two Sides the Precipice is dreadfully steep The Earl of  Winchelsea  has a Brass  Alexander Severus  found here on the Reverse  Jupiter fulminans  On the West Side at Top of the Hill without the Camp is a round Pit full of good Springwater always to the Brim but never overflowing in the dryest Summers which at those Seasons is of the greatest Service to the Country round and Thousands of Cattle are every Day  driven thither from a considerable Distance to drink I am informed there is such another upon the Top of  Chutehill  Southeast from hence very high and no other Water within some Miles of it The Prospect from  Martin'shall  is exceeding fine  At  Farlo  not far from  ClarendonPark  was the Birthplace of Sir  Stephen Fox  and where the Town sharing in his good Fortune shews several Marks of his Bounty as particularly the building a New Church from the Foundation and getting an Act of Parliament passed for making it Parochial it being but a Chapel of Ease before to an adjoining Parish also Sir  Stephen  built and endowed an Almshouse here for Six poor Women with a Master and a Freeschool The Master is to be a Clergyman and to officiate in the Church which including the School is a very good Maintenance  I am now to pursue my first Design and shall take the West Part of  Wiltshire  in my Return where are several Things to be still taken notice of In the mean time I went on to  Langbro'  a fine Seat of my Lord  Colerain  which is very well kept  From hence in my Way to the Seaside I came to  NewForest  of which I have said something already with relation to the great Extent of Ground which lies waste and has a vast Quantity of large Timber  This Part of the Country is a lasting Monument of the  Conqueror  's Tyranny and Oppression who laid it open and waste for a Forest and for Game for which Purpose he unpeopled the Country pulled down the Houses and the Churches of several Parishes and Towns and of abundance of Villages turning the poor People out of their Habitations and Possessions for the sake of his Deer The same Histories likewise record that Two of his own Sons and particularly his immediate Successor  William Rufus  lost their Lives in this Forest  William Rufus  being shot with an Arrow directed at a Deer which glancing on a Tree changed its Course and striking the King full on the Breast killed him And another Son whilst in hot Pursuit of the Game was caught up by the Boughs of a Tree and hanged like  Absalom  These they relate as just Judgments of God on the cruel Devastation made here by the Conqueror and they still shew the Tree on which the Arrow glanced In King  Charles  II's Time the Tree was ordered to be surrounded with a Pale great Part of which is now fallen down and whether the Tree be really so old or not is to me a great Question the Action being about Years ago  I cannot omit mentioning here a Proposal made some Years ago to the Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  for repeopling this Forest which I can be more particular in than any other Man because I had the Honour to draw up the Scheme and argue it before that noble Lord and some others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over or rather providing for when they were come over the poor Inhabitants of the  Palatinate  a Thing in itself commendable but as it was managed made of no Benefit to  England  and miserable to those poor People  Some Persons being ordered by the noble Lord abovementioned to consider of Measures how those poor People should be provided for without Injury to the Publick NEW FOREST in  Hampshire  was singled out to be the Place for them  Here it was proposed to draw a great square Line containing Acres of Land marking out Two large Highways or Roads thro' the Centre crossing both Ways so that there should be Acres in each Division exclusive of the Land contained in the said Crossroads  Then to single out Men and their Families who should be recommended as honest industrious People expert in or at least capable of being instructed in Husbandry To each of these should be parcelled but in equal Distributions Acres of this Land so that the whole Acres should be distributed to the said Families for which they should have no Rent to pay and be liable to no Taxes but such as would provide for their own Sick or Poor repairing their own Roads  c  This Exemption to continue for Years and then to pay each  l  a Year to the Crown  To each of these Families it was proposed to advance  l  in ready Money as a Stock to set them to work and to hire and pay Labourers to inclose clear and cure the Land which it was supposed the first Year could not be so much to their Advantage as following Years allowing them Timber out of the Forest to build themselves Houses and Barns Sheds and Offices as they should have Occasion also for Carts Waggons Ploughs Harrows and the like necessary Things  These Families would by the Consequence of their own Settlements employ and maintain such a Proportion of others of their own People that the whole Number of  Palatines  would have been provided for had they been many more than they were and that without being any Burden upon or Injury to the People of  England  on the contrary they would have been an Advantage and an Addition of Wealth and Strength to the Nation and to the Country in particular where they should be thus seated  Two Things would have been answered by the Execution of this Scheme  viz  That the annual Rent to be received for all those Lands after Years would abundantly pay the Publick for the first Disburses which  would amount to  l  that Rent being then to amount to  l per Annum    More Money than would have done this was thrown away upon them here to keep them in Suspense and afterwards starve them sending them a begging all over the Nation and shipping them off to perish in other Countries  The Spot where the Design was laid out was near  Lindhurst  in the Road from  Rumsey  to  Lymington  whither I now directed my Course  Lymington  is a little but populous Seaport standing opposite to the Isle of  Wight  in the narrow Part of the Streight which Ships sometimes pass thro' in fair Weather called the  Needles  and right against the antient Town of  SouthYarmouth  in that Isle which I have mentioned before This Town of  Lymington  is chiefly noted for making excellent Salt from whence all these South Parts of  England  are supplied as well by Water as Landcarriage  From hence are but few Towns on the Seacoast West tho' several considerable Rivers empty themselves into the Sea nor are there any Harbours or Seaports of Note except  Pool  As for  Christchurch  tho' it stands at the Mouth of the  Avon  which as I have said comes down from  Salisbury  and brings with it all the Waters of South and East Parts of  Wiltshire  and receives also the  Stour  and  Piddle  Two  Dorsetshire  Rivers which bring with them all the Waters of the North Part of  Dorsetshire  yet it is a very inconsiderable poor Place scarce worth seeing and less worth mentioning in this Account But here I will close this my fifth Letter with assuring you that I am  Yours  c  LETTER VI CONTAINING A  DESCRIPTION  of the County of  DORSET  Part of  SOMERSETSHIRE DEVONSHIRE CORNWALL  c  SIR  NOW enter into the County of  Dorset  and first I rode Northwest into it to see the antient Town of  Wimburn  or  Wimburnminster  It stands  large extended fertile Vale like a M  ow with much Wood about it  with Fish Here was a Nunnery  Year by  Cuthberga  Sister to King  The Church is a very great one antient and wellbuilt with a very firm strong square Tower  high but was without doubt much  it stood a most ex  may be cre    its Situation  question    In this Church are the Monuments of several noble Families and of King  Etheldred  who was slain in Battle by the  Danes  He was a Prince fam'd for Piety and Religion and according to the Zeal of those Times was esteem'd a Martyr because he died fighting for his Religion and his Country against the Pagan  Danes  The Inscription upon his Grave is preserv'd and has been carefully repair'd so as easily to be read and is as follows  In hoc loco quiescit Corpus  S Etheldredi  Regis  West Saxonum  Martyris qui Anno Dom DCCCLXXII xxiii  Aprilis  per Manus  Danorum  Paganorum Occubuit  That is    Here rests the Body of St  Etheldred  King of the  West Saxons  and Martyr who fell by the Hands of the Pagan  Danes  in the Year of our Lord the d of  April    Here also are the Monuments of the great Marchioness of  Exeter  Mother of  Edward Courtney  Earl of  Devonshire  and last of the Family of  Courtneys  who enjoy'd that Honour as also of  John de Beaufort  Duke of  Somerset  and his Wife Grandmother of King  Henry  VII by her Daughter  Margaret  Countess of  Richmond    This last Lady I mention because she was Foundress of a very fine FreeSchool which has since been inlarg'd and had a new Benefactress in Queen  Elizabeth  who augmented the Stipend and annex'd it to the Foundation The famous Cardinal  Pool  was Dean of this Church before his Exaltation  The Inhabitants of  Wimburnminster  are numerous but poor and chiefly maintain'd by the Manufacture of knitting Stockens which employs great Part of  the County of  Dorset  of which this is the first Town Eastward  Wimbourn St Giles  's in this Neighbourhood is a very handsome Seat belonging to the Earl of  Shaftesbury    From hence I went to  Ringwood  upon the River  Avon  over a deep sandy Moor 'Tis a large thriving Place full of good new Brick Houses seated by the Side of a great watry Valley the River dividing itself into several Streams and frequently overflowing large Quantities of the Meadow Here they deal pretty much in Leather Stockens Druggets and narrow Cloth  South of  Wimburn  over a sandy wild and barren Country we came to  Pool  a considerable Seaport and indeed the most considerable in all this Part of  England  for here I found some Ships some Merchants and some Trade especially here was a good Number of Ships fitted out every Year to the  Newfoundland  Fishing in which the  Pool Men  have been particularly successful for many Years past  The Town sits in the Bottom of a great Bay or Inlet of the Sea which entering at one narrow Mouth opens to a great Breadth within the Entrance and comes up to the very Shore of this Town it runs also West up almost to  Warcham  a little below which it receives the  Froom  and  Piddle  the Two principal Rivers of the County  This Place is famous for the best and biggest Oysters in all this Part of  England  which the People of  Pool  pretend to be famous for pickling and they are barrell'd up here and sent not only to  London  but to the  WestIndies  and to  Spain Italy  and other Parts 'Tis observ'd more Pearl are found in the  Pool  Oysters and larger than in any others in  England    As the Entrance into this large Bay is narrow so it is made narrower by an Island called  Branksey    which lying in the very Mouth of the Passage divides it into two and where there is an old Castle call'd  Branksey  Castle built to defend the Entrance and was of no small Advantage to the Trade of this Port in the time of the late War with  France    Wareham  has been a  Roman  Town There has been a Castle by the Waterside West of the Bridge built by King  William  I perhaps upon the  Roman  'Tis an old Corporation now decay'd the Sands obstructing the Passage of the Vessels And  Pool  being better seated from a FisherTown has risen to be a rich Seaport They say here have been a Mint and many ParishChurches of which Three remain I saw a ruinous Religious House as I pass'd by the River  Frome  This Haven is of vast Extent like a Sea having a narrow Entry Two Rocks about  CorfCastle  have an odd Appearance hence  South of  Wareham  and between the Bay I have mention'd and the Sea lies a large Track of Land which being surrounded by the Sea except on one Side is call'd an Island tho' it is really more properly a Peninsula This Track of Land is better inhabited than the Sea Coast of this West End of  Dorsetshire  generally is and the Manufacture of Stockens is carry'd on there also It is call'd  The Isle of Purbeck  and has in the middle of it a large Markettown call'd  Corf  and from the famous Castle there the whole Town is now call'd  CorfCastle    This Part of the Country is eminent for vast Quarries of Stone which is cut out flat and used in  London  in great Quantities for paving Courtyards Alleys Avenues to Houses Kitchens Footways on the Sides of the Highstreets and the like and is very profitable to the Place as also in the Number of Shipping employed in bringing it to  London  There are also several Rocks of very good Marble  only that the Veins in the Stone are not black and white as the  Italian  but grey red and other Colours It is also noted for excellent Tobaccopipe Clay sold at  London  for Thirty Shillings  per  Ton  From hence to  Weymouth  we rode in View of the Sea The Country is open and in some respects pleasant but not like the Northern Parts of the Country which are all fine Carpet Ground and the Herbage so sweet that their Sheep are esteem'd the best in  England  and their Wool extremely fine  From hence we turned up to  Dorchester  the County Town It is regular and clean The  Isenings  reet  enters it by the North of  Winterburn  at  Westgate  This is by the ignorant Countrypeople referr'd to the Work of the Devil who they say cast it up in a Night's time The Foundations of the antient  Roman  Wall appear qui  e round the Town but Eastward a Street is built upon it and the Ditch fill'd up 'tis still call'd  The Walls  for that way the Town is swell'd out into a considerable Village with a Church and handsome Tower nam'd  Fordington  or  Farington  There are Three other Churches in the Town and the Streets are wide and handsome On the South and West Side without the Walls a handsome Walk of Trees is planted looking pleasantly into the Country tho' being common S  camores they are inconvenient by harbouring Flies The Banks of the River here are steep for the Town stands on high Ground Beyond the River are Meadows and warm sandy Lands on this Side the fine chalky Downs pleasant for riding and profitable in excellent Grain The Air must needs be wholsome the Climate warm and a sufficient Distance from the Sea The People of  Fordington  rose in Arms and prevented the Farmers from levelling a great Barrow The late Rev Mr  Place  known for his Philosophical Works liv'd here and possess'd a great Quantity of  Roman  Coins call'd here  Dornmoney    or  King Dor's Money  Near this Place is a noble  Roman  Amphitheatre The Vulgar call it  Maumbury  but have no Notion of its Purpose tho' 'tis a common Excursion for the Inhabitants and the Terrace on the Top is a noted Place of Rendezvous affording an agreeable circular Walk a Prospect of the Town and wide Plains of Corn Fields all around  Dorchester  is a regular Town with handsome wide Streets but the Houses tho' built of Stone are old and low It is kept very clean by reason of its high Situation and the River on which it is situated  The Inhabitants Care in setting the able Poor to work and relieving the Aged and Impotent is highly praiseworthy And Sir  Josiah Child  in his Treatise on Trade recommends their Example as worthy to be followed by other Places It is famous also for excellent Beer  On the pleasant Downs round this Town they told me there were Sheep fed within Six Miles of the Town every way which is Miles in Diameter and Miles in Circumference and when I viewed the Country round I confess I could not but incline to believe it  It is observable of these Sheep that they are exceedingly fruitful and the Ewes generally bringing Two Lambs they are for that Reason bought by all the Farmers thro' the East Part of  England  who come to  Burford  Fair in this County for that Purpose and carry them into  Kent  and  Surrey  Eastward and into  Buckinghamshire Bedfordshire  and  Oxfordshire  North Even our  BansteadDowns  in  Surrey  so fam'd for good Mut  on is supplied from this Place The Herbage of these Downs is full of the most aromatick Plants such as nourish the Sheep to a great Degree and the Sheeps Dung again nourishes that so that the Valleys are render'd extremely  fruitful by the washing of the Water in hasty Showers from off these Hills  From  Dorchester  it is Six Miles to the Seaside South and the Ocean in View almost all the Way The first Towns we come to are  Weymouth  and  Melcomb  two Towns lying at the Mouth of a little Rivulet call'd  The Wey  for it scarce deserves the Name of a River however the Entrance makes a very good tho' small Harbour and they are join'd by a wooden Bridge so that nothing but the Harbour parts them yet they are separate Corporations and choose each of them Two Members of Parliament  Weymouth  is a sweet clean agreeable Town considering its low Situation and close to the Sea 'tis wellbuilt and has a great many substantial Merchants in it who drive a considerable Trade and have a great Number of Ships belonging to the Town they carry on in time of Peace a Trade with  France  but besides this they trade also to  Portugal Spain Newfoundland  and  Virginia  and have a large Correspondence up in the Country for the Consumption of their Returns The Wine and  Newfoundland  Trade are both considerable here and they have a Customhouse and good Key  Without the Harbour is an old Castle call'd  Sandfoot Castle  and overagainst them is  Portland Castle  situated in the Isle of that Name and the Road called  Portland Road  which affords a safe Harbour for Ships in bad Weather  From this Isle of  Portland  comes our best and whitest Freestone with which the Cathedral of St  Paul  's the Monument and all the publick Edifices in the City of  London  are chiefly built and the Quarries whence these Stones are dug are well worth the Observation of a Traveller  The Island is indeed little more than one continued Rock of Freestone about Seven Miles in Compass  and the Height of the Land is such that from this Island they see in clear Weather above half over the Chanel to  France  tho' here 'tis very broad The Sea off this Island and especially to the West of it is counted the most dangerous Part of the  British  Chanel Due South there is almost a continued Disturbance in the Waters by reason of what they call Two Tides meeting which I take to be no more than the Sets of the Currents from the  French  Coast and from the  English  Shore this they call  Portland Race  and several Ships not aware of these Currents have been embay'd to the West of  Portland  and driven on Shore on the Beach of which I shall speak presently where they have been lost  To prevent this Danger and guide the Mariner in these Distresses they have set up Two Lighthouses on the Two Points of that Island which are very useful and serviceable to Ships  This Island tho' seemingly miserable and thinly inhabited yet the Inhabitants being almost all Stonecutters we found there were no very poor People among them and when they collected Money for the rebuilding St  Paul  's they got more in this Island than in the great Town of  Dorchester    Tho'  Portland  stands a League from the main Land of  Britain  yet it is almost join'd by a prodigious Riff of Beach that is to say of small Stones cast up by the Sea which runs from the Island so near the Shore of  England  that they ferry over with a Boat and a Rope the Water not being above half a Stone'sthrow over and the said Riff of Beach ending as it were at that Inlet of Water turns away West and runs parallel with the Shore quite to  Abbotsbury  a Town about Seven Miles beyond  Weymouth    I name this to explain what I said before of Ships being embay'd and lost here this is when coming  from the Westward they omit to keep a good  Offing  or are taken short by contrary Winds and cannot weather the high Land of  Portland  but are driven between  Portland  and the main Land and run on Shore on that vast Beach  On the Inside of this Beach and between it and the Land is the said Inlet of Water which they ferry over as above to pass and repass to and from  Portland  This Inlet opens at about Two Miles West grows very broad and makes a kind of Lake within the Land of a Mile and a half broad and near Three Miles in Length the Breadth unequal At the farthest End West of this Water is a large Decoy and the Verge of the Water well grown with Wood and proper Groves of Trees for Cover for the Fowl In the open Lake or broad Part is a continual Assembly of Swans here they live feed and breed and the Number of them is such that I believe I did not see so few as or We saw several of them upon the Wing very high in the Air whence we supposed they flew over the Riff of Beach which parts the Lake from the Sea to feed on the Shores  From this Decoy West the Lake narrows and at last almost closes till the Beach joins the Shore and so  Portland  may be said not to be an Island but Part of the Continent And now we came to  Abbotsbury  a Town antiently famous for a great Monastery and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins  From hence we went on to  Bridport  a pretty large but not wellbuilt Corporation Town on the Sea Shore here we saw Boats all the way on the Shore fishing for Mackerel which they take in the easiest manner imaginable and in such prodigious Plenty that there has been a Watch set to prevent Farmers dunging their Land with them which it was thought might be apt to infect the Air  In the Year an Act passed for restoring and rebuilding the Haven and Piers of  Bridport  in order to bring it to its antient flourishing State for heretofore it was a Place of great Trade and Commerce but by reason of a great Sickness which formerly swept away the greatest Part of its most wealthy Inhabitants and by other Accidents the Haven became neglected and choaked with Sands the Piers fell to Ruin and the Town of consequence to Decay so that there was no Security for Ships that happened to be driven by Stress of Weather into the deep and dangerous Bay wherein the Haven formerly was which occasioned frequent Shipwrecks The Act therefore authorizes the Bailiffs and Burgesses of  Bridport  to levy certain Tolls and Duties on divers Merchandizes  c  in order to restore the said Piers and Harbour  Bridport  was formerly the only Place for twisting of Ropes for the Royal Navy and it is still used for that Purpose the neighbouring Lands yielding plenty of Hemp  From  Bridport  we came to  Lyme  a Town particularly made famous by the Landing of the Duke of  Monmouth June  in the Time of King  James  II with only Twelve Men Many of his Party were afterwards put to Death on the Spot and their Limbs hung up in the Town Before that Time the Duke of  Tuscany  set Footing here in his Tour to  England    This is called  LymeRegis  it is a Town of good Figure and has in it several eminent Merchants who carry on a considerable Trade to  France Spain Newfoundland  and the  Streights  and tho' they have neither Creek or Bay Road or River they have a good Harbour and such as is not in all  Britain  besides if in the World  It is a massy Pile of Building consisting of high and thick Walls of Stone raised at first with all  the Methods that Art could devise and maintain'd now with very little Difficulty the Walls are raised in the main Sea at a good Distance from the Shore It consists of one main and solid Wall of Stone large enough for Carts and Carriages to pass on the Top and to admit Houses and Warehouses to be built on it so that it is broad as a Street Opposite to this but farther into the Sea is another Wall of the same Workmanship which crosses the End of the first and comes about with a Tail parallel to that  Between the Point of the first or main Wall is the Entrance into the Port and the second or opposite Wall breaking the Violence of the Sea from the Entrance the Ships go into the Basin and ride there as secure as in a Millpond or Wetdock  This Work is call'd the  Cobb  the Customhouse Officers have a Lodge and Warehouse upon it It might be strengthen'd with a Fort and the Walls themselves are firm enough to carry what Guns they please to plant upon it but they did not seem to think it needful and as the Shore is convenient for Batteries they have some Guns planted in proper Places for the Defence of the  Cobb  and the Town  This Town is under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen and may pass for a Place of Wealth considering the Bigness of it Here we found the Merchants began to trade in the Pilchard Fishing tho' not to so considerable a Degree as they do farther West the Pilchards seldom coming up so high Eastward as  Portland  and not very often so high as  Lyme    I visited from hence some of the Towns in the Northwest Part of this Country as  Blandford  on the River  Stour  in the Road between  Salisbury  and  Dorchester  a handsome wellbuilt Town pleasantly seated in a Flexure of the River before charming  Meadows and rich Lands Wood thrives exceedingly here Indeed this County is a fine Variety of Downs Woods Lawns Arable and Pasture Land rich Valleys and an excellent Air The dry Easterly Winds the cold Northern and the Western Moisture are temper'd by the warm Southern saline Breezes wasted hither from the Ocean But  Blandford  is chiefly famous for making the finest Bonelace in  England  where they shewed me in my first Visit to it some so exquisitely fine as I think I never saw better in  Flanders France  or  Italy  and which they said they rated at above  l  Sterling a Yard  This was the State and the Trade of the Town when I was there in my first Journey but  June  the whole Town except Twentysix Houses was consumed by Fire together with the Church The Consternation of the People was so great and the Fire so furious that few saved any Goods  An Act passed in for the better and more easy Rebuilding of this Town and for determining Differences touching Houses and Buildings burnt down or demolished therein and as several wise Regulations were made by it  Blandford  now makes a much better Appearance than ever  From  Blandford  I went West to  Stourbridge  which and the Country round is employ'd in the Manufacture of Stockens it was once famous for making the finest best and highestpric'd knit Stockens in  England  but that Trade is much decay'd by the Increase of the Knittingstocken Engine or Frame which has destroyed the Hand Knittingtrade for fine Stockens thro' the whole Kingdom of which I shall speak in another Place  From hence I came to  Shireburn  a large and populous Town with One Collegiate or Conventual Church and may justly claim to have more Inhabitants in it than any Town in  Dorsetshire  tho' it is  neither the County Town nor sends Members to Parliament It was once a Bishop's See which was removed to  Salisbury  The Church is still a Reverend Pile and shews the Face of great Antiquity Here begins the  Wiltshire  Medley Cloathing tho' this Town be in  Dorsetshire  of which I shall speak at large in its Place  Shaftesbury  is also on the Edge of this County adjoining to  Wiltshire  and  Dorsetshire  being Fourteen Miles from  Salisbury  over that fine Down or Carpet Ground call'd  Salisburyplain  It is not an extraordinary Town but situated upon the Top of a high Hill and which closes the Plain or Downs and whence a new Scene is presented  viz  a Prospect of  Somerset  and  Wiltshire  where 'tis all inclosed and grown with Woods Forests and planted HedgeRows the Country rich fertile and populous the Towns and Houses standing thick and being large and full of Inhabitants and those Inhabitants fully employ'd in the richest and most valuable Manufacture in the World  viz  the  English  Cloathing as well the Medley or mix'd Cloathing as Whites both for the Home and foreign Trade on which I shall be more particular in my Return thro' the West and North Part of  Wiltshire    Shaftesbury  has however lately received some Improvements from the Generosity of a neighbouring Gentleman and particularly in a fine Plantation on the Top of  ParkHill  which he was so kind as to indulge the Inhabitants with for a Place of Walking and Diversion but attempting on the Strength of his good Offices to the Town to prescribe to them in the Choice of a Member of Parliament he has not met with the grateful Return he might have expected Violence having been done to the very Plantation he had so generously devoted to the publick Service and Pleasure of the Inhabitants  In my Return to my Western Progress I pass'd some little Part of  Somersetshire  as thro'  Evil  or  Yeovil  upon the River  Ivil  in going to which we descend a long steep Hill called  Babylonhill  but from what Original I could find none of the Country People able to inform me  Northward upon an high sandy Hill by the Bank of the River  Ivel  is a  Roman  Camp called  Chesterton  under which lies the Town of  Sandy  the  Salinae  of the  Romans  where abundance of  Roman  and  British  Antiquities have been found and immense Quantities of Coins  Yeovil  is a Markettown of good Resort and some little Cloathing is carried on in and near it Its main Manufacture at this Time is Gloves It deals also in Corn Cheese Hemp and all Sorts of Provisions  It cannot pass my Observation here that when we are come this Length from  London  the Dialect of the  English  Tongue or the Country way of expressing themselves is not easily understood It is true that it is so in many Parts of  England  besides but in none in so gross a Degree as in this Part As this Way of boorish Speech is in  Ireland  called the Brogue upon the Tongue so here 'tis named  Jouring  It is not possible to explain this fully by Writing because the Difference is not so much in the Orthography as in the Tone and Accent their abridging the Speech  Cham  for  I am Chill  for  I will Don  for  do on  or  put on  and  Doff  for  do off  or  put off  and the like  From  Evil  or  Yeovil  we came to  Crookorn  thence to  Chard  which immediately brought me into  Devonshire    It may not be unacceptable here to insert a general Description of this large County which may convey to the Reader some Idea of the Nature of the  Soil its Productions and the Method of Improvement as well as the Manufactures and Merchandizes on which the Trading Part of the Inhabitants subsist  To begin then The Western Part of the County bordering on  Cornwall viz  about  Tavystock Briddestow Oakhampton Holsworthy Bideford Great Torrington Chulmleigh Chagford Moreton Hampsted  and all round the Skirts of  Dartmore  as well as that large Forest itself consists of a very coarse moory or fenny Soil very barren in its Nature in some Places productive of nothing but a dwarf Kind of Furze of little or no Value At other Places grow nothing but Rushes or a coarse four Kind of Pasturage which the Cattle will not feed upon and therefore it dries up and withers into a Sedge The Soil here is generally a stiff Clay thro' which the Water cannot soak away this renders it very unhealthy especially to Sheep which in those Parts are of a small Kind and very subject to the Rot which in wet Seasons especially destroys them in great Numbers and what adds to the Malady is that neither the Industry of the Husbandman for which this County is deservely famous nor any Compost that has yet been found out will to any purpose cure this Sterility  The principal and indeed the only profitable Return that the Inhabitants can make out of those Lands is by breeding Black Cattle for which they are very well adapted for here are bred those fine Oxen in great Numbers which by the Drovers of  Somersetshire  and thereabouts are brought up and in their flat Feeding Lands betwixt  Bridgewater  and  Wells  which I have seen almost covered with them fattened fit for  Smithfield  Market where they drive and sell them to the  Londoners  who have not so good Beef from any other Part of the Kingdom  The Northern Parts of the County are of a quite different Nature from the former for this generally consists of a dry healthy Soil especially about  Ilfordcombe South Moulton Dulverton  and all along the Brim of the Forest of  Exmore  Those Downs are far from being a luxuriant Feeding but are very good Grazing for Sheep and being well dressed with Lime which is brought over hither by Water from  Wales  Dung Sand and other Compost manured by the indefatigable Labour of the Inhabitants produce tolerable Crops of Corn I say  tolerable  ones for tho' they far exceed the Productions in  Dorset Wilts Hants  c where Sluggishness so far prevails as to leave Dame Nature destitute of the least human Assistance the Fertility is by no means comparable to that of the  Eastern  and  Middle  Parts of the County in the  former  of which a rich Marl in some Parts and a fertile sandy Soil in others and in the  latter  a fat strong Soil of a deepred Colour intermixed with Veins of different Kinds of Loam produce very great Crops of Corn and Pease of the best Kind not to be excelled in the whole Island Neither doth it fall behind in Meadow Ground and Pasturage Clover Eaver and Trefoil Grass and Turneps as is evident to a Person who goes thro' any of the Markets and beholds the fine wellfed Beef and Mutton with which they are plentifully stored  About  Teingmouth Dartmouth Totnes Modbury Plymouth Ashburton  and all the South Parts of the County called the  SouthHams  the Lands are generally of a different Kind from any of the former in most Places very good for Arable and Pasture but especially for Cyder Fruits A great Part of this large Track lies on a  Stratum  of Marble which the Inhabitants break up and burn into Lime and therewith dress their Lands to their very great Improvement Neither is this all the Advantage they  make of those Quarries for in many of them is found Stone which for its Hardness Soundness and beautiful Veinings rivals the best  Italian  Marbles and falls very little if any thing short of them in Lustre Great Quantities of this Stone are sent to  London  and other Places where they are wrought up for the noblest Purposes At other Places on this Southcoast are Quarries of Slate for covering Houses and this likewise of the best Kind which are not only fetched away by Landcarriage to the Distance of Ten Twelve and Sixteen Miles but great Quantities of them are sent Coastwise to all the Towns on the  British  Shore and exported to  Holland Flanders  and other Places beyond Sea  The Reader will not by this Description conclude that the Lands in any Part of the County are all one and the same Kind Downs Fens Rocks and Woodgrounds are interspersed among the best Lands as there are also some good Arable and Pasture amongst the most desolate and barren and whoever looks round him in his own Situation will know in what Sense to take this general Description To proceed  At divers Places are found large Quantities of very good Oak Timber as well as Ash Elm Beech  c  and such of it as grows in Places whence it can be convey'd either by Land or Watercarriage to  Plymouth  Dock are there served in for the Use of his Majesty's Navy  Coppicewood  is so very plenty that altho' the Woollen Manufacturers take off great Quantities in Charcoal and yet greater Quantities are expended in common Firing there being no Coal raised in this County yet the Price is so low that the Lands where it thrives well will not generally produce more than  s per  Acre  communibus annis  The Lands in  Devonshire  save only the Forest of  Dartmore Halldenhill  and some Heaths Moors  and coarse Downs of no very large Extent which for the most part are not capable of Improvement not even by  Devonshire  Husbandry are divided into small Inclosures and in Places where any Shrubs will grow by quickset Hedges banked up Four or Five Feet high with Earth And as the Inclosures are small so are the Farms or Tenements in these Parts even to a very manifest Inconvenience for the general Method here is for Gentlemen to lease out the Tenements of their Manors for Years determinable on Three Lives taking Fines for such Leases and reserving no more than about One Shilling in the Pound of the yearly Value  By this means Men of small Fortunes find an Opportunity to lay out the little Money they have in what they call  Purchasing an Estate  which likewise serves for a Settlement upon a Wife for the Money she brings Hence a Family comes on and craves a Maintenance out of a Farm of perhaps  l  a Year which surely can produce but a very poor one whereas or  l  sunk in this Purchase would have enabled him to manage a Farm of  l  a Year out of which by Industry and good Management the Family might not only live in a more plentiful manner the Children be better educated and instructed to understand the Business of the Farm but Money likewise laid up every Year towards setting them out in the same Method of living This I take to be the principal Cause of the Poverty and Hardship that appears in Country Places and of the Difficulty of getting a good Tenant at Rackrent for any Farm whose Value exceeds  l  a Year  I should have mentioned that in my Way to  Chard  I passed thro'  Axminster  a pretty considerable Markettown and the first in the County of  Devon  The great Western Road to  London  goes thro' this Town Here my Curiosity led me to go into the  Church and view the Monuments of the  Saxon  Princes or rather the Bishop of  Sherburne  and Two Dukes who were slain at the Battle of  Brunaburgh  in that Neighbourhood fought by King  Athelstane  with Seven  Danish  Princes over whom he obtained the Victory in a Field thence called  King'sfield  to this Day The Monuments of those  Saxon  Worthies were under Arches in the Walls of the Church Two of which have been lately filled up  Here in Memory of the Victory King  Athelstane  founded a Minster for Seven Priests which in Afterages were reduced to Two for whom a Portion of Land was allotted called  Priestaller  which with the Parsonage now belongs to Two Prebendaries of the Church of  York  The Manor continued in the Crown till the Reign of King  John  who gave it to the Lord  Brewer  a Daughter and Coheir of which Family  Alicia  brought it in Marriage to Lord  Mobun  of  Dunstar  whose Posterity with Consent of King  Henry  III  Anno Gratiae    Id Jan regnant H Fil Johann Reginaldus Mohun filius Reginaldi Aliciae Brewer fundavit Abbatiam de Newnham in Maner de Axminster in Com Devon  Abbot  Gill  the th of  March    Hen  VIII surrendered it to the King The yearly Value at that time was  l    s    d  Ford Abbey  is in this Neighbourhood heretofore a stately Fabrick lofty and very magnificent adorned with curious Carvings and Embellishments of the  Gothick  kind some of whose Beauties still remain as may be seen in a modern Print thereof published by Mr  Buck  It was first founded by  Adeliza  Daughter of  Baldwin de Brioniis  Baron of  Oakhampton Anno  and dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  for  Cistercian  Monks At the Surrender it was valued at  l    s    d  Halfpenny yearly  Near  Axminster  lies  Kilmington  quasi  Killmentown  from the great Slaughter there made at the  Battle beforementioned and  Membury  i e  Maimburgh  whither the Maimed in that Battle were sent to be relieved now famous for the best  Devonshire  Cheese  At  Northleigh  or rather at  Uplime  which Manor was formerly the Inheritance of the Abbey of  Glastonbury  was born Mr  Nathanael Carpenter  the Author of the Treatise of Geography and divers others Tracts that bear his Name  Cullyford  in this Neighbourhood was the Habitation of Sir  Thomas Gates  who in bound to  Virginia  of which Colony he was then made Governor was in a violent Tempest shipwreck'd and with Sir  George Somers  cast on Shore by which Accident they were made the first Possessors of the Island of  Bermudas  or  Summer Island    This Track abounds with Lands which were formerly appropriated to Churches and Religious Houses  viz  at  Smallridge Axmouth Farwood Salcombe Dunkerwell  a Monastery of  Cistercian  Monks  Sidbury Sidmouth Branscombe Monketon Luppit Awlscombe  and at divers other Places which from the Richness of the Soil makes good the Observation That the Religious of those Days made it their chief Endeavour to possess themselves of the best Things of this World  At  Tidwell  alias  Tideswell  is a Pond or Pool which boils up like that of the same Name at  Weeden  in  Derbyshire  The same Road I was before in brought me from  Axminster  to  Honiton    This is a large and beautiful Markettown very populous and wellbuilt and is so very remarkably paved with small Pebbles that on both Sides the Way a little Chanel is left shouldered up so that it holds a small Stream of fine clear running Water with a little square Dippingplace left at every Door so that every Family in the Town has a clear clean running Rivulet as it may be called just at their  own Door and this is much finer pleasanter and more agreeable to look on than that at  Salisbury  which they so much boast of  Here we see the first of the Sergemanufacture of  Devonshire  a Trade too great to be described in Miniature It takes up this whole County which is the largest and most populous in  England Yorkshire  excepted but  Devonshire  is so full of great Towns and those Towns so full of People and those People so universally employ'd in Trade and Manufactures that it cannot be equall'd in  England  nor perhaps in  Europe    Honiton  stands in the best and pleasantest Part of the whole County and I cannot but recommend it to Gentlemen who travel this Road that if they observe the Prospect at  Honiton  for half a Mile till they come down the Hill and to the very Entrance into  Honiton  the View of the Country is the most beautiful Landskip in the World and I do not remember the like in any one Place in  England  'Tis observable that the Market of this Town was kept originally on the  Sunday  till it was changed by the Direction of King  John  This Town is now much employ'd in the Trade of Lacemaking  On the Road from  Honiton  they have a beautiful Prospect almost all the Way to  Exeter  which is Miles  On the Lefthand of this Road lies the Town of  St Mary Ottery  so called as some say from the River  Otter  and that from the Otters found formerly in it This Town was given by King  Edward the Confessor  to the Church of  St Mary  at  Roan  in  Normandy  but was afterwards bought by  Grandison  Bishop of  Exeter  who made of it a Quarter College in  Edward  III and therein placed secular Priests with other Ministers to whom he gave the whole Manor Parish Tythes Fines Spiritual Profits  c  which amounted to  l    s    s  yearly  Bicton  formerly  Bicheton  was given by  William the Conqueror  to one of his Servants called  William Porto  It afterwards reverted to the Crown and by  Henry  I was given to one  John Janitor  so called from his Office for by his Tenure he was to keep the Prison for this County by which Service it is held to this Day by the worthy Owner thereof  Henry Rolle    Esq  who is at this time Knight of this Shire His Ancestor Sir  Henry Rolle    Esq  had it by Marriage with  Anne  the Daughter of Sir  Thomas Dennis  to whose Family it came from the beforementioned  Janitor  thro'  Ballister Sackville  and  Coplestone    From hence we came to  Exeter  the Capital of the County of  Devon  a City which hath often changed its Name for it was the  PenCaer  and  CaerEske  of the  Britons  the  Augusta  of the  Romans  the  Isca  of  Ptolemy  the  IscaDamnoniorum  of  Antonine  the  Exancester  of the  Saxons  which was afterwards abreviated to  Excester  and  Exeter  from the great Number of Monks there It had for some time the Name of  Monketon  but at length from that large River which washes its Walls and bears the Name of  Exe  whether from the Forest of that Name where it rises or the Forest from it I cannot determine it retains that of  Exeter  which it seems now to be varying for  Exon  It was first fortified with a Stone Wall which still remains intire by King  Athelstane  and was for some time the Seat of the  WestSaxon  Kings  That the  Romans  were here is highly probable among other Proofs from their Coins that have been dug up at divers Places in particular a Gold one of  Nero  at  Exeter  one of  Theodosius  near  Barnstaple  several Silver ones of  Severus  and other Emperors but especially from a great Quantity of them dug up about Twenty Years since at  Exeter  within the Close together with the Urn in which  they were buried I saw a great Number of those some of which were of Silver but the greatest Part of them were a Mixture of Tin and Copper they had the Impression of  Gordianus Philippus  and other Emperors  King  Athelstane  founded here a Monastery to St  Mary  and St  Peter  for Monks of the Order of St  Benedict  The Chapel of  St Mary  now fitted up for a Library and furnished with a pretty great Number of Books which are but of little Use because placed in a very confused Order is the very Eastermost Part of the Cathedral and was doubtless the first Beginning of that now handsome Fabrick King  Etheldred  founded also within the Close a House for Monks and another for Nuns Divers other Religious Houses as the Priories of  St James St Nicolas St John Baptist  the  Grey Fryers  c were the Work of Afterages  The Walls are in pretty good Repair and make a Walk round the City with the Pleasure of seeing a fine Country on opposite Hills full of Wood rich Ground Orchards Villages and Gentlemens Houses The Beauty of the Place consists of one long Street called  Highstreet  broad and strait The Houses are of a very old but good Model spacious commodious and not inelegant This Street is full of Shops well furnished and all sorts of Trades look brisk The People are industrious and courteous the Fair Sex are truly such as well as numerous their Complexion and generally their Hair of a fair Cast they are genteel disengaged of easy Carriage and good Mien There has been of late a vast Increase of Buildings within and without the City The Situation renders it of Necessity clean dry and airy The Soil thither from  Honyton  is rather sandy than stony whence it must needs be very healthful There are many Booksellers In Dr  Musgrave  's Garden an Head of the Empress  Julia Domna  of a Colossean Size was dug up The Headdress is suitable to those Times and neither the Manner nor Carving are despicable tho' the Graver has not done it Justice 'Tis the noblest Relique of  British  Antiquity which we know of this Sort 'tis Inches from the Top of the Attire to the Chin and belonged to a Statue of Feet Proportion originally set upon some Temple or Palace There is also an Inscription of  Camillus    This Country remarkably abounds with Persons afflicted with the Gout which is attributed to the Custom of marling the Lands with Lime and the great Use of poor sweet Cyder especially among the meaner People  In the Northern Angle of the City and highest Ground stands  Rugemontcastle  once the Residence of the  WestSaxon  Monarchs afterwards of the Earls of  Cornwall  'Tis of a squarish Figure not very large inviron'd with a high Wall and deep Ditch It has a Rampire of Earth parallel to the Top of the Wall forming a Terrace which overlooks the City and Country Here are the Assizehouse and a Chapel  The Bridge over the  Exe  is of great Length and has Houses on both Sides and at both Ends with a considerable Vacancy in the Middle In the  Guildhall  are the Pictures of General  Monk  and the Princess  HenriettaMaria    The Bishop's See of this Western Diocese hath had several Removes for it was first at  Bodmyn  for the County of  Cornwall  and since that at  Tawton  for this County Afterwards both were joined and placed at  Crediton  And lastly about the Year King  Edward the Confessor  and his Queen  Edyth  inthroned  Leofricus  who had been Three Years Bishop of  Crediton  into the See of  Exeter  in the following very solemn manner  On the Southside of the high Altar in the Cathedral were erected and are there still to be seen perfect as when first made Three Seats or Alcoves adorned with  Gothick  Carvings to the Height of about Feet which are supported with Brass Pillars in the Middle of these was the Bishop installed by the King and Queen The Form of Words thus  I Kynge Edward taking Leofricke bye the Ryghte  aunde and Edythe my Queene bye the Leste doe installe hym the fyrste and most famous Byschoppe of  ron wythe a grate Desyre of Aboundance of Blessynges to all such as shall furder and encrease the same but wythe a fearful and execrable Curse on all such as shall diminish or take anye thynge from it  The Church was about Years in building and very remarkable it is to behold the Uniformity with which it was carried on for nobody can discover the least Incongruity in the Parts so much is it like the Workmanship of one and the same Architect  There are some antient funeral Monuments in the Cathedral but first as Matter of the greatest Antiquity let me take notice of the Bishop's Throne in the Choir which at the Dissolution of Episcopacy in King  Charles  I's Time was as a useless Thing taken down but whether the Workman imploy'd to do it were well affected to that Order or else had some private Instructions from somebody in Power who foresaw that it would some time or other be of Use again certain it is that a great deal of Care was taken of the Materials for it is now replaced and every Part of it as sound and good as when first made The  Gothick  Carvings about the Canopy are at least Feet high and a vast deal of good Workmanship of that Kind  there is about it it is I believe coeval with the See  The antique Monuments as I before mentioned to be seen here are particularly those of  Humphry Bohun  Earl of  Hereford Hugh Courtenay  Earl of  Devon  and his Lady the Lord  Chichester  Sir  Peter Carew  Sir  Thomas Speke  Sir  Richard Stapleton Dowrich  of  Dowrich  the Bishops  Leofricus Stafford Branscombe Oldham Bradbridge Lacy Cary  and others especially that of Bishop  Stapleton  the pious Founder of  Exetercollege  in  Oxford  which Society in grateful Remembrance of their Benefactor have lately repaired and beautified his Monument which in regard to some of the Carvings about it excess any thing I ever saw of so old a Date in the  Gothick  way  The Altarpiece done Years ago is a Representation of the Inside of the Church in Perspective an exquisitely fine Piece of Painting and excepting only a little Injury it received from the Swords of the Saints Militant in the great Rebellion exceedingly well preserved The fine painted Glass of which there is a great deal underwent the Fury of the same pious Reformers who after they had made a forcible Entry and  "taken to themselves  this  House of God in Possession"  under the Umbrage of an Ordinance of Parliament of the th of  August  broke out the best of those Paintings and irretrievably ruined all the Scripture History therein represented neither was their Rage confined to those brittle Materials for the carved Figures of the Patriarchs Prophets Kings  c  of which there were a great many became Objects of their furious Zeal and Ignorance for there the maimed Bodies are now to be seen some without the Head others have lost one or both Legs or Arms  c  all of them some way or other mangled And having by this means taken away what they feared would draw them into  they  divided this Cathedral by a Partitionwall betwixt the Choir and the main Body of it one of which Divisions was made use of by an Independent and the other by a Presbyterian Congregation  And now that I am taking notice of the Decorations of this magnificent Piece of Antiquity let me just mention that in one of its Towers is a very large Bell of about Sixty hundred Weight and in the other a fine Ring of Ten large ones An Organ of very good Workmanship and supported by a Tetrastyle of very beautiful  Gothick  Columns stands where the beforementioned Partitionwall did The largest Pipes in this Instrument are of a great Length and Inches in Diameter which is said to be Two Inches more than those at  Ulm  which is so famed for its Largeness  The wellfinished Alcove of modern Work for the Bishop and the Pulpit and Pews of the like in the Nave or Body of the Church together with the neat Marble Font and the Two Suits of Hangings for the Choir one of Tapestry and the other of Velvet and the fine Suit of gilt Plate for the Communion Service is all that I shall further add about the grave and welladapted Ornaments and Furniture of this Temple or House of God  To complete this Description with a Circumstance which I think ought by no means to be passed over The Solemnity Decency and affecting Harmony with which the Service and Musick vocal and instrumental is generally performed by the Choralvicars Organist and Choristers and which is well worthy of Imitation  'Tis no uncommon Thing to see People here in a Morning which is at least five times as many as usually attend at  St Paul  's or any other Six o'clock Chapel I was ever at And 'tis commendable that the  Reader  doth not here curtail the Morning Service by leaving out any Part thereof as in other Places they do Here are Two Morning Lectures preached weekly  viz Tuesday  and  Friday  Mornings  the numerous Congregation which  Winter and Summer attend the daily Prayers at Six in the Morning and their grave and pious Behaviour there I say all this together render this Cathedral a Glory to the Diocese the Envy of other Choirs and the Admiration of Strangers  Other antique Buildings of a publick Nature are the Chapterhouse and Cloisters the Bishop's Palace the Houses belonging to the Dean the Chancellor Treasurer and other Dignitaries of the Church the  Guildhall  the Walls and Gates of the City with those of the Castle and the Close the Hospital of  St John the Baptist  Parish Churches within the City and Liberties thereof the Bridge over the River  Exe  a large and very handsome Conduit for Water in the Centre of the Four principal Streets to which may be added some Chapels and Almshouses yet standing and the Ruins of divers others which are Monuments of the Piety of their Founders and the Impiety of those who neglect them  Modern Buildings of a publick Nature this City hath not many to boast of  St Paul  's one of the Twenty Churches beforementioned the Chancellor's House a very handsome and well contrived Workhouse for the Poor Three or Four Meetinghouses a Quay for landing Goods and a Customhouse include all that have been erected within Years past  The Civil Government of this City is by a Mayor Aldermen and Commoncouncil a Recorder Sheriff Four Stewards a Chamberlain and Townclerk who are attended by a Swordbearer who wears the Cap and carries the Sword given by King  Henry  VII before them to Church and on all publick Processions Four Serjeants at Mace and as many Staffbearers the former in Gowns and the latter in Liveries with Badges and which adds not a little to their Splendor they keep a Band of Four Musicians in constant Pay  There are moreover Twelve Companies of incorporated Trades who on publick Occasions and on Gaudydays walk in the Mayor's Train dressed in Gowns each Company having a Beadle in a laced Cloak bearing the Ensigns of their several Professions to usher them  For supplying the Inhabitants with Water there is broughtin a pretty large Quantity by subterraneous Pipes from some Springs in the Parish of  St Sidwell  without  Eastgate  Part of which is reposited for common Use in the Conduit beforementioned and another Part is conveyed to the Houses of the Bishop Dean Canons  c  within the Close and to a common Pump just at the West Entrance of the Cathedral But all this would be far short of a sufficient Supply and therefore an exceeding good Engine is fixed in the River the great Wheel of which working by the same Water forces the River Water thro' Elmtrees bored for that Purpose into a large Reservoir fixed about Feet above Ground in the highest Part of the City adjoining to the  Guildhall  from whence thro' other Pipes it is dispersed to all Parts of the City in great Plenty The Expence of which to each Housekeeper that will have it is from to  s  a Year according to the Quantity their Occasions require  The River  Exe  was heretofore in its main Stream navigable to the Walls of the City but on a Difference between the Mayor and the then Earl of  Devon  on a very trifling Occasion  viz  Which of their Purveyors should be first served with a Pot of Fish in the Market that Earl revenged himself by choaking the Mouth of the River and by making Weirs with Timber Sand  c  thereby intirely ruining the Navigation thereof farther up than  Topsham  And so great was the Power and Obstinacy of the Earl at that time that tho' the Citizens obtained  a Decree in Equity for their Relief it was never executed  To remove this Inconvenience the Inhabitants about Years since by Aid of an Act of Parliament at a great Expence perfected a Work which had been begun above Years before they cut a new Chanel for the Water cross which they placed Sluices or Floodgates thro' the lowermost of those Gates they let in the flowing Tide the Ebb of which immediately shuts the Gate and that keeps up a Body of Water for about Two Miles sufficient to carry up the Vessels so far in their Way at which Place another of those Gates shuts after the Vessel is past it by Capsterns there fixed for that Purpose It must be considered that the Floor of the Dyke is thus far on a Level and consequently the Water of an equal Depth without the Inconvenience of any Current the lower Sluice being shut as before  The whole Declivity from the Quay at  Exeter  to the lowermost Floodgate at  Topsham  which gives the River its Current is about Eight or Ten Feet all which is sunk at once here above this second Sluice and therefore in order to bring up Ships over this Fall it was necessary that a third Floodgate should be added which is accordingly done at about Feet from the former And now the Ship being between these two Floodgates the lower being kept shut the uppermost of the two is opened and by this means the Water between them raised to a Level with that of the Remainder of the Dyke above and the Ship by this Contrivance floats freely over the rising Ground and thence on the fresh Water for the Tide is of no farther Use for about Two Miles more which brings her to the Head of the Works where there is another Floodgate and this ponds the whole River so as to throw the waste Water over a strong Stone Weir into its natural Chanel The Water so kept back  by this Uppersluice and the Weir makes a stagnant Pool above and here the Vessels lie at their Moorings and unload at a Quay adjoining to the City Walls  Semper fidelis  is the Motto to the City Arms and how just a Title they have thereto will appear from their Behaviour when they have been attacked by the Enemies of their lawful Sovereign of which take the following short Sketch  When the Town was quitted by the  Romans  the Citizens defended it against the  Saxons  for their then lawful Masters the  Britons  and held it out for Years after the Eastern Parts of the Island had submitted  When they had been compelled to admit the  Saxons  into a sort of Coordinate Power with them they courageously withstood the  Danes  and tho' at last overcome by them they took the first Opportunity and joined with King  Alfred  who with their Assistance routed the  Danes    After this as long as they were able they upheld a Share of Government with the  Saxons  until King  Athelstane  wholly subdued them and as beforementioned fortified the Town with a Wall and Gates This generous Prince was so well pleased with their Bravery that he granted them many Privileges and Immunities  In the Year the Citizens again defended themselves stoutly against the  Danes  who came upon them by Sea but landed and formed a Camp on the Northside thereof in a Place called  Danescastle  to this Day where their Trenches are yet to be seen  The Town held out for a Month against  Swain  King of  Denmark  and was at last taken by Treachery  When  William the Conqueror  came against it the Citizens defended themselves until a Part of the City Wall fell down  The loyal Townsmen took Part with  Maud  their undoubted Sovereign against King  Stephen  and were at last reduced by Famine  In the Earl of  Devon  came before it in behalf of the then rightful Claimant King  Edw  IV and the Citizens delivered it up sending away the Lords and others of the  Lancastrian  Party to  Calais    They shew'd their Loyalty to King  Henry  VII by defending the Town against  Perkin Warbeck  the Pretender of that Time In Testimony whereof that King gave them the Sword and Cap which  Regalia  are no small Part of their Pomp to this Day  The rebellious Commons of  Devon  and  Cornwall  met with a very stout Resistance here and tho' grievously pinched with Famine the Town held it out until the th of  August  when they were relieved by the Lord  Russel  In Memory of which that is still a Gaudyday and a Sermon is preached yearly on the Occasion by the Mayor's Chaplain  In the grand Rebellion it was twice besieged and held out for the Royal Cause until the King's Affairs grew everywhere desperate And as soon as General  Monk  appeared in Opposition to the illegal Powers the Citizens assembled themselves and declared for a free Parliament  When the Prince of  Orange  landed at  Torbay  and sent a Detachment to take Possession of this City the Inhabitants received them but coldly and tho' they knew themselves incapable of making any Resistance and were as sensible as other Parts of the Kingdom of the Danger they were in from arbitrary Power yet were they very tender of  joining in any Affair that might be construed a Rebellion to their lawful Prince  To the Account of Religious Houses and Lands formerly appropriated thereto let me add here the Priory of  Polesloe  and that of  Cowick  each of them but one Mile from  Exeter  at a greater Distance but must be mentioned here or not at all  Canonsleigh CanonsTeing Indio  and larger than either of these the Abbey of  Buckfastleigh  Part of whose Ruins are yet to be seen and not one Instance is there amongst them all that contradicts my former Observations in relation to the Goodness of the Soil  Near the Mouth of the River  Exe  on the West Banks thereof is  Powderhamcastle  now and for many Ages past the Seat of a Family of  Courtenays  Descendants from the Earl of  Devon  of that Name This Seat built in the manner of a Castle is a very grand Piece of Antiquity and was the Work of  Isabel  the Daughter of  Baldwin de Rivers  and Widow of  William de Fortibus  in the Reign of King  Henry  III  Halldown  is a pretty large dry heathy Common of about Seven Miles in Length and about Three in Breadth which tho' separated by some inclosed Grounds of a pretty good Nature seems to be the same Vein of Land of which the Forest of  Dartmore  and the downy Part of  Ashburton Ilsington Bridford c  consist  On the North and quite home to the Brink of this Down is that rich Track of Land which I have already described as Part of the most fertile Soil in this County  Tho' this Down is in itself a very flinty barren Soil yet is its Situation so delightful the open Prospect both by Sea and Land so engaging and the whole Circuit thereof so adapted to rural Recreations that the like Number of Gentlemens Seats as lie round the Skirts thereof within so little  Compass of Ground are not to be met with at any Place that I know of save only about  London  which is not only a Confirmation of what I have observed but a very great Addition to the Delight arising from the large Extent of the View  And here it cannot be foreign to my Subject to insert the Names of those genteel Habitations and that of their several worthy Owners and Possessors    Ugbrook  the Lord  Clifford  Baron of  Chudleigh  a Family of great Honour and Worth tho' of the  Romish  Persuasion    Dawlish  the Country Seat of the Right Reverend Dr  Weston  present Lord Bishop of  Exon      Powderhamcastle  the Honourable Sir  William

Bowhay  formerly the Seat of  Petre  Ancestor of the present Lord  Petre    Exeter  is particularly famous for two Things which we seldom find united in the same Town  viz  That it is full of Gentry and yet full of Trade and Manufactures  The Sergemarket held here every Week is very well worth a Stranger's seeing and next to the  Brigg Market  at  Leeds  in  Yorkshire  is the greatest in  England  The People assured me that at this Market is generally sold from to to and sometimes a Hundred thousand Pounds Value in Serges in a Week  The  Exe  or  Esk  is a very considerable River and the principal in the whole County and by the Contrivance we have mentioned Ships of Tons now come up to the City  Exeter  drives a very great Correspondence with  Holland  as also directly to  Portugal Spain  and  Italy  shipping off vast Quantities of their Woollen Manufactures especially to  Holland  the  Dutch  giving very large Commissions here for the buying of Serges Perpetuanas and such Goods which are made not only in and about  Exeter  but at  Crediton Honiton Culliton St Mary Ottery Newtonbushell Ashburton  and especially at  Tiverton Cullumpton Bampton  and all the Northeast Part of the County which Part is as it may be said fully imploy'd the People made rich and the Poor well maintained by it Some are of Opinion however that  Exeter  has of late Years visibly diminished in its Trade some Part of which has it is said removed itself to other Quarters  On the Northside of the Castle and which was formerly its Counterscarp is a very beautiful Terracewalk bounded by a double Row of fine Elms and extended round one Quarter of the City  viz  from the Eastgate to the Northgate This for the  Fineness of the Air Length of the Walk and the Landschape in View is not perhaps inferior to any thing of the kind in  England    This County and this Part of it in particular has been famous for the Birth of several Persons eminent as well for Learning and Arts as for War Particularly Sir  William Petre  who was Secretary of State and PrivyCounsellor to King  Henry  VIII  Edward  VI Queen  Mary  and Queen  Elizabeth  and Seven times sent Embassador into foreign Countries  Sir  Thomas Bodley  famous and of grateful Memory to all learned Men and Lovers of Letters for his collecting and establishing the best Library in  Britain  which is now at  Oxford  and is called after his Name the  Bodleian Library    Sir  Francis Drake  born at  Plymouth    Sir  Walter Raleigh    The learned Mr  Richard Hooker  Author of the  Ecclesiastical Polity  c  Dr  Arthur Duck  a Civilian well known by his Works among the learned Advocates of  Doctors Commons    Dr  John Moreman  of  Southold  famous for being the first Clergyman in  England  who ventured to teach his Parishioners the  Lord's Prayer Creed  and  Ten Commandments  in the  English  Tongue and reading them publickly in the Parish Church of  Mayenhennet  in this County of which he was Vicar  Dr  John de Brampton  a Man of great Learning who flourished in the Reign of  Henry  VI was famous for being the first that read  Aristotle  publickly in the University of  Cambridge  and for writing several learned Books which are now lost    Peter Blundel  a Clothier who built the FreeSchool at  Tiverton  and endowed it very handsomely  Sir  John Glanvill  a noted Lawyer and one of the Judges of the CommonPleas  Serjeant  Glanvill  his Son as great a Lawyer as his Father  Sir  John Maynard  an eminent Lawyer of later Years one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal under King  William  III All these Three were born at  Tavistock    Sir  Peter King  Recorder of  London  Lord Chief Justice of the CommonPleas several Years Lord HighChancellor of  England  and created a Peer of this Realm  General  Monk  the great Instrument in the Restoration of our Civil and Ecclesiastical Government Laws and Liberty  The great Duke of  Marlborough  CaptainGeneral of the  English  Forces in Q  Anne  's Wars  I shall take the North Part of this County in my Return from  Cornwall  so I must now lean to the Southcoast for in going on indeed we go Southwest  About Miles from  Exeter  and thro'  Newtonbushel  a large but meanly built Markettown we go into the antient Town of  Totness  on the River  Dart  It was formerly of great Note and still is a pretty good Town and has some Trade but has more Gentlemen in it than Tradesmen of Note they have a very fine Stone Bridge here over the River which being within or Miles of the Sea is very large and the Tide flows or Feet at the Bridge Here we had the Diversion of seeing them catch Fish with the Assistance of a Dog in this manner On the South Side of the River and on a Slip or narrow Cut or Chanel made on purpose stands a Cornmill the Milltail or Floor for the Water below the Wheels is wharfed up on either Side with Stone above Highwater Mark and for above or Feet in Length below it on that Part of the River toward the Sea  At the End of this Wharfing is a Grating of Wood the Cross Bars of which stand bearing inward sharp at the End and pointing towards one another as the Wires of a Mousetrap  When the Tide flows up the Fish can with Ease go in between the Points of these Crossbars but the Mill being shut down they can go no farther upwards and when the Water ebbs again are left behind not being able to pass the Points of the Grating which like a Mousetrap keeps them in so that they are left at the Bottom with about a Foot or a Foot and half Water We were carry'd hither at Lowwater where we saw about or small Salmon from to Inches long which the Countrypeople call  Salmon Peal  and to catch these they throw in a Net on a Hoop at the End of a Pole the Pole going cross the Hoop which in some Places they call a Shove Net The Net being fix'd at one End of the Place they put in a Dog who is taught his Trade beforehand at the other End and he drives all the Fish into the Net so that only holding the Net still in its Place the Man took up Two or Threeandthirty Salmon Peal at the first time  Of these we had Six for our Dinner for which they ask'd a Shilling only and for such siz'd Fish and not so fresh I have seen  s    d  each given at a  London  Fishmarket whither they are sometimes brought from  Chichester  by LandCarriage They have also delicate Trouts here  This excessive Plenty of so good Fish other Provisions being cheap in Proportion makes the Town of  Totness  a very good Place to live in especially for such as have large Families and but small Estates and many such are said to come into those Parts on purpose for saving Money  This Town made itself remarkable for the Address of the Inhabitants to King  George  I on the Union of the Emperor and King of  Spain  by the  Treaty of  Vienna  they profess'd their Zeal and Loyalty to his Person and when the good Town of  Totness  had but a very insignificant Share of Property assur'd the King of their Readiness to grant not only  s  a Pound Landtax but to give into the Bargain the other  s  if his Majesty's Service requir'd it together with several other extravagant Declarations of Zeal and Ostentation which made them the Subject of Ridicule all over the Kingdom for being so lavish in their Professions when as a Corporation they had little or nothing to give  About Ten Miles North of  Totness  lies  Ashburton  a good Markettown and Thoroughfare from  Exeter  to  Plymouth  This is one of the Four Stannary Towns for the County of  Devon  and lies but a little Way in from the Forest of  Dartmore  The principal Trade of this Town and indeed all the Towns and Villages in the whole County is in the Woollen Manufacture  The Three other Stannary Towns are  Tavistock Plympton  and  Chagford  the last of which is a very poor inconsiderable Place and neither that nor  Plympton  are capable of entertaining the Suitors if the Lord Warden should be ever inclined to adjourn the Court thither  And now having mentioned this Court of Stannary it may not be improper to give a further Description thereof  By divers Charters granted to the Tinners by King  Edward  I  c  the Court is to be held at  Crockeren Torr  a noted Hill and Rock in the middle of the Forest far distant from any House the Lord Warden of the Stannaries is the Judge of this Court on whose Summons the Jurors appear who are generally Gentlemen within the Jurisdiction I had my Information from a Gentleman who if I mistake not told me he had served as a Juror and that when the Earl of  Bath  was Lord  Warden and held a Court there he was attended by Gentlemen well mounted  At this desolate Place where no Refreshment is to be had but what the Company bring with them no Shelter from the Weather nor any thing to sit upon but a Moorstone Bench the Court is called but then the next Act of the Steward is to adjourn to one of the Stannary Towns usually  Tavistock  and the Company immediately makes the best of their Way thither  At this Court in former Times when the Tin Mines in this County were in a flourishing State a great deal of Business was dispatched the Price of the Tin was fix'd Differences in relation to the Works adjusted and Acts made for Regulation of every thing relating thereto Several Presentments of the Jurors are printed and this Meeting is vulgarly called  The Parliament for the Stannaries  the Place of Meeting in the Forest  The Parliament House  and the Presentment of the Jurors  Acts of Parliament    The Abbey of  Tavistock  the Priory at  Plympton  and the Monastery at  Buckland Monachorum  were very large Endowments and their Scite well establishes the Observation I have several times before made in relation to the Fertility of the Soil where those Orders of Men generally seated themselves An Observation I have made rather to confirm that of other Writers than as Matter of Wonder or Reflection for would it not be strange if the Ecclesiasticks should not be as capable of chusing for themselves as other People or that they should chuse the worst if they might have the best  At  Tavistock  I saw some stately Remains of that grand Building and among other things part of the Butments of the Arch of a Bridge over the  Tavy  which the Inhabitants call  Guilebridge  and relate the following Story  viz  That one  Childe  Owner  of the Manor of  Plymstock  made his Will and gave the said Lands to the Church where his Body should be buried and that afterwards hunting in the Forest he lost his Company and his Way and tho' as his last Shift he kill'd his Horse and got into the warm Belly of him he at length died there with the Extremity of Cold The Body after some Search was found by the  Tavistoch  Men who had by some means come to the Knowledge of his Will and by them carried away towards their Abbey The  Plymstock  Men hearing thereof lay in Ambush for them at a Bridge where they apprehended they must pass but in this they were deceived for the Priests built a slight Bridge on Purpose over which they carried the Corps by which Statagem they obtain'd the said Land and hence says the Tradition this is called  Guilebridge    From  Totness  we went still South about Seven Miles all in View of the River to  Dartmouth  a Town of Note seated at the Mouth of the River  Dart  where it empties itself into the Sea at a very narrow but safe Entrance The Opening into  Dartmouth Harbour  is not broad but the Chanel deep enough for the biggest Ship in the Royal Navy The Sides of the Entrance are high mounded with Rocks without which just at the first Narrowing of the Passage stands a good strong Fort beyond a Platform of Guns which commands the Port  The narrow Entrance is not much above half a Mile and then it opens and makes a Basin or Harbour able to receive Sail of Ships where they may ride with the greatest Safety and the Entrance may be chain'd up on Occasion I went out in a Boat to view this Entrance and the Castle or Fort that commands it and coming back with the Tide of Flood I observ'd some small Fish to skip and play upon the Surface of the Water upon which I ask'd What Fish they were Immediately one of the  Rowers or Seamen started up in the Boat and throwing his Arms abroad as if he had been mad cries out as loud as he could bawl  A Scool a Scool  The Word was taken on the Shore as hastily as it would have been on Land if he had cry'd Fire and by that Time we reach'd the Quays the Town was all in a kind of an Uproar  The Matter was that a great  Shoal  or as they call it a  Scool  of Pilchards came swimming with the Tide directly out of the Sea into the Harbour The Boatowner lamented his being unprepared for them for he said that if he could but have had a Day or two's Warning he might have taken Tun of them in short nobody was ready for them except a small Fishingboat or Two one of which went into the Middle of the Harbour and at Two or Three Hawls took about  It was observ'd that beyond the Mouth of the Harbour was a whole Army of Porpoises which it seems pursu'd these Pilchards and 'tis probable drove them into the Harbour The  Scool  drove up the River a great Way even as high as  Totness  Bridge as we heard afterwards so that the Countrypeople who had Boats and Nets caught as many as they knew what to do with  Dartmouth  is situated on the Westside of this Basin or Harbour in a kind of a Semicircle on the Ascent of a steep Hill which tho' large and populous is but meanly built yet the Quay is large and the Street before it spacious Here live some very flourishing Merchants who trade very prosperously and to the most considerable trading Ports of  Spain Portugal Italy  and the Plantations but especially to  Newfoundland  and from thence to  Spain  and  Italy  with Fish and they drive a good Trade also in their own Fishery of Pilchards which is hereabouts carried on with the greatest Number of Vessels of any Port in the West except  Falmouth    Dartmouth  like other Towns in  Devonshire  is full of Dissenters who have here a very large Meetinghouse The  French  burnt it in  Richard  I's Time and attempted it afterwards but were bravely repulsed and chiefly by the Women who fought desperately and took Monsieur  Castel  their General Three Lords and Twentythree Knights Prisoners and made a great Slaughter among them besides but how this glorious Action fell to the Share of the Women and whether the Men were inactive or absent is not mentioned  A little to the Southward of this Town and to the East of the Port is  Torbay  a very good Road for Ships about Twelve Miles in Circuit tho' sometimes especially with a Southerly or Southeast Wind Ships have been obliged to quit the Bay and put out to Sea or run into  Dartmouth  for Shelter  In the Bottom of this Bay is a beautiful wellbuilt and finelysituated House call'd  TorrAbbey  formerly a Religious House but now the Inheritance of  Cary  Esq  Vespasian  is said to have landed here when he came to attack  Arviragus  King of  Britain  And here it was that King  William  III enter'd with a Fleet of Transports and Sail of Men of War under the Conduct of Admiral  Herbert  since Lord  Torrington    About Three Miles to the West of  Dartmouth  is a little Fishingtown call'd  Brixham  remarkable for a Spring of Water that ebbs and flows very sensibly a Description of which may not be unacceptable especially as the Account I give of it is the Result of my own Observations for I had so much Patience as to sit by it for Fourteen Hours together and carefully observe its Periods and the Quantity of its ebbing and flowing  The Situation of this Spring is pretty near the Foot of a large Ridge of Hills and the Quantity of Water that flows from it is considerable It falls into  a large Basin where it is very easy to observe by lying in an inclining Plain the perpendicular Height of its Ebbing and Flowing as well as the Time between high and low Water  By a careful Observation of a great Number of Fluxes and Refluxes I find that when it proceeds regularly as it does sometimes for Eight Hours together it is Eleven times in an Hour for thus the th of  July  I observ'd it high Water at  h  ′ in the Morning and continued to observe it until  h  ′ in the Afternoon in which Interval of Seven Hours it had ebb'd and flow'd exactly Seventyseven times  There happens sometimes an Intermission of those Ebbings and Flowings for in the Morning of the same Day I observ'd that from  h  ′ to  h  ′ it had no Motion at all and at another time I found it to intermit for an Hour or more  The Basin which receives the Water contains as I guess about Twenty Feet in Area and the perpendicular Height of the Flowing when I observ'd it which was in the Middle of Summer and at a dry Season was various  viz  sometimes an Inch and three Quarters and at other times not above half an Inch but generally about one Inch and one Eighth  The Reader will be rather pleased with this Description as it may in some measure confirm that ingenious and very probable Hypothesis which was read by Dr  Atwell  before the Royal Society and is publish'd in their Transactions touching reciprocating Springs and of this which is called  Laywell  in particular  From  Dartmouth  we went to  Plympton  beforementioned as a poor Town though it was formerly of great Account and the Glory of the antient Earls of  Devon  where are Tenures at this Day called  Castleguard  for defending and repairing the Walls of the Castle which however is now in Ruins From  thence the Road lies to  Plymouth  Distance about Six Miles  Plymouth  is indeed a Town of Consideration and Importance The Situation of it is between Two very large Inlets of the Sea and in the Bottom of a large Sound or Bay which is incompass'd on every Side with Hills and the Shore generally steep and rocky tho' the Anchorage is good and it is pretty safe Rideing In the Entrance to this Bay lies a large and most dangerous Rock which at Highwater is cover'd but at Lowtide lies bare where many a good Ship has been lost when they have thought all their Dangers at an End  Upon this Rock which was called the  Eddystone  from its Situation the ingenious Mr  Winstanley  whom I have mention'd before  p  undertook to build a Lighthouse for the Direction of Sailors and with great Art and Expedition finish'd it which Work considering its Height the Magnitude of its Building and the little Hold there was to fasten it to the Rock stood to Admiration and bore out many a bitter Storm  Mr  Winstanley  often visited and frequently strengthen'd the Building by new Works and was so confident of its Firmness and Stability that he usually said to those who doubted its Standing in hard Weather that he only desir'd to be in it when a Storm should happen  But in the dreadful Tempest of  Nov  when he happen'd to be so unhappy as to have his Wish he would fain have been on Shore making Signals for Help but no Boats durst go off to him and in the Morning after the Storm nothing was to be seen but the bare Rock the Lighthouse being gone in which Mr  Winstanley  and all that were with him perish'd and a few Days after a Merchant's Ship call'd the  Winchelsea  Homewardbound from  Virginia  not knowing the Lighthouse was down  ran foul of the Rock and was lost with all her Ladeing and most of her Men but there is now another Lighthouse built on the same Rock by the Corporation of  Trinityhouse  in Pursuance of an Act of Parliament passed in the Fifth of Queen  Anne    As  Plymouth  lies in the Bottom of this  Sound  in the Centre between the Two Waters so there lies against it in the same Position an Island which they call  St Nicolas  on which is a Castle that commands the Entrance into  HamOuze  and indeed that also into  Catwater  in some Sort On the Shore overagainst this Island is the Citadel of  Plymouth  a small but regular Fortification inaccessible by Sea but not exceeding strong by Land except that they say the Works are of a Stone hard as Marble and would not soon yield to the Batteries of an Enemy but that is a Language our modern Engineers laugh at It is surrounded with a deep Trench out of which was dug the Stone that built the whole Citadel which is about three Quarters of a Mile in Circumference and has great Guns on its Walls which stand thickest towards the Sea Several Guns are also planted on part of the old Fort lying almost level with the Water all which gives the greatest Security to the Ships in the Harbour  The Town stands above the Citadel upon the same Rock and lies sloping on the Side of it towards the East the Inlet of the Sea which is call'd  Catwater  and is a Harbour capable of receiving any Number of Ships and of any Size washing the Eastern Shore of the Town where they have a kind of natural Mole or Haven with a Quay and all other Conveniencies for bringing in Vessels for loading and unloading nor is the Trade carried on here inconsiderable in itself  The other Inlet of the Sea as I term it is on the other Side of the Town and is cal'd  HamOuze  being the Mouth of the River  Tamar  a considerable  River which parts the Two Counties of  Devon  and  Cornwall  Here the War with  France  making it necessary that the Ships of War should have a Retreat nearer Hand than at  Portsmouth  the late King  William  order'd a wet Dock with Yards dry Docks Launches and Conveniencies of all kinds for building and repairing of Ships to be built These wet and dry Docks are about Two Miles up the  HamOuze  and for the Neatness and Excellency of the Work exceed all that were ever built of the Kind being hewn out of a Mine of Slate and lin'd with  Portland  Stone The dry Dock is built after the Mould of a Firstrate Man of War and the wet Dock will contain Five of the same Bigness What follow'd these as it were of Course was the Building of Storehouses and Warehouses for the Rigging Sails naval and military Stores  c  of such Ships as may be appointed to be laid up there with very handsome Houses for the Commissioners Clerks and Officers of all kinds usual in the King's Yards to dwell in It is in short now become as complete an Arsenal or Yard for building and fitting out Men of War as any the Government are Masters of and perhaps much more convenient than some of them tho' not so large and this has occasion'd a proportional Increase of Buildings to the Town  Here are Two fine Churches and Two or Three Meetinghouses for Dissenters and  French  Refugees as also a Freeschool and an Hospital for Bluecoat Boys  Opposite to this Place on the other Side  HamOuze  is situated  Mount Edgcumbe  the Seat of  Richard Edgcumbe    Esq  deem'd one of the noblest Prospects in  England  overlooking at once the Sea the Harbour Citadel and Town of  Plymouth  and the County adjacent for a great Way  From  Plymouth  we pass the  Tamar  over a Ferry to  Saltash  a little poor shatter'd Town the first we set Foot on in the County of  Cornwall  The  Tamar  here is very wide and the Ferryboats bad so that I thought myself well off when I got safe on Shore in  Cornwall    Mr  Carew  publish'd in the Reign of King  James  I a very judicious Survey of this County dedicated to Sir  Walter Raleigh  The Reader may there inform himself in a very particular manner of its Natural History and the Produce Customs and Rarities which it abounds with Among other Curiosities he may there find complete Lists of the Knights Fees Barons Knights and Men at Arms together with the Survey of the Acres taken by  Solomon de Roff  and his Fellows Justices itinerant at  Launceston  in the Reign of King  Edward  I by which Survey it appears that this County contain'd at that Time Acres and the Author tells us that a  Cornish  Acre or one fourth Part of a Knight's Fee contained Nine Farthings Land each of which was as he thinks about Thirty of our Statute Acres If all this be true then that County contained at that time One million and Five hundred thousand Acres which is more by one Third than it is now estimated to be and doth in some measure strengthen the Conjecture that a great Part of the Land on this Coast is devoured by the Sea and that the  Scilly  Rocks were formerly a Part of the Land tho' now Ten Leagues distant  Among the natural Productions of this County ought not to be omitted their Slate the best in  Europe  for covering of Houses the  Moorstone  which by a very laborious Polishing a Matter very lately attempted equals in Beauty the  Egyptian Granate  I take no Notice of the Gold Silver Copper Tin Lead the Marble Agat Coral  and even Diamonds which are here found because these have been observ'd by all who mention the Productions of this Western County and for the same Reason shall omit the manner of their working their Mines and refining the Ore  The Inhabitants have been remarkable for their Strength of Body witness among numberless others  John Bray  who carried on his Back Six Bushels of Meal of Fifteen Gallons to the Bushel and the Miller a Man of Twentyfour Years of Age on the Top of it also  John Roman  who carried at one time the whole Carcase of an Ox  Saltash  seems to be the Ruins of a larger Place it is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen has many Privileges sends Members to Parliament has the sole OysterFishing in the whole River which is considerable It has also Jurisdiction upon the River  Tamar  down to the Mouth of the Port so that they claim Anchorage of all small Ships that enter the River their Coroner sits upon all Bodies that are found drown'd in the River and the like Here is a good Market and it is very much benefited by the Increase of the Inhabitants of  Plymouth  as lying near the Dock at the Mouth of  HamOze  for those People choose rather to go to  Saltash  to Market by Water than to walk to  Plymouth  by Land for their Provisions because first as they go in the Townboat the same Boat brings home what they buy so that it is much less Trouble secondly because Provisions are bought much cheaper at  Saltash  than at  Plymouth  and of late they have some Ships that use the  Newfoundland  Fishery  There is no other Town up the  Tamar  till we come to  Launceston  the County Town which I shall take in my Return except  Kellington  a pretty good Market and Portreve Town where is a good Markethouse and a neat Church which as well as the other Buildings in the Town are in good Condition  so I turn'd West keeping the South Shore of the County to the  Land'send    From  Saltash  I went to  Leskard  about Seven Miles This is a considerable Town wellbuilt has People of Fashion in it and a very great Market it is one of the Five Stannary Towns and was once still more eminent and had a good Castle and a large House where the antient Dukes of  Cornwall  kept their Court it also enjoy'd several considerable Privileges especially by the Favour of the  Black Prince  who as Prince of  Wales  and Duke of  Cornwall  resided here and in Return they say this Town and the Country round it raised a great Body of stout young Fellows who entered into his Service and followed his Fortunes in his Wars But these Buildings are so decay'd that there are now scarce any of the Ruins of the Castle or of the Prince's Court remaining Here was also antiently a Chapel much resorted to by Pilgrims in Popish Times and in the Town is a Fountain of very clear Water to which many miraculous Cures were attributed  It still boasts of its  Guild  or  Townhall  on which is a Turret with a fine Clock a good FreeSchool well provided a very fine Conduit in the Marketplace an antient large Church dedicated to St  Martin  and a large newbuilt  Meetinghouse  for the Dissenters which I name because they assured me there were but Three more and those inconsiderable in all the County of  Cornwall  whereas in  Devonshire  which is the next County there are reckoned about some of which are exceeding large and fine  This Town is also remarkable for the Defeat of the Parliament Army by Sir  Ralph Hopton  and for a very great Trade in all Manfactures of Leather such as Boots Shoes Gloves Purses Breeches  c  and some Spinning of late Years is set up here  encourag'd by the Woollen Manufacturers of  Devonshire    Between these Two Towns of  Saltash  and  Leskard  is the Borough of  St Germans  now a Village decay'd and without any Market but the largest Parish in the whole County in the Bounds of which are contained Villages and the Town of  Saltash  among them for  Saltash  Church it seems was but a Chapel of Ease to  St Germans  It has been antiently a Bishop's See which was translated from  Bodmyn  hither and afterwards from  St Germans  to  Crediton  then one of the best Towns in the County and thence to  Exeter  This Town takes its Name from St  German  Bishop of  Auxerre  in  Burgundy  who came over from  France  to preach against the Heresy of  Pelagius  which then began to spread in  England  and took up his Residence here The Ruins of the Episcopal Palace at  Cuttenbeck  a Mile and half from the Town which afterwards dwindled into a Farmhouse are still visible A Gentleman of the Name of  Elliott  was lately a great Benefactor to this Town having endowed a publick School there repaired the Sessionshouse and beautify'd the Church where he was buried and has a fine  Italian  partycoloured Marble Monument erected to his Memory by his Widow There is still an Episcopal Chair in the Church and several other Seats belonging to Canons The Town stands on a rising Ground and is built in the Form of an Amphitheatre  In the Neighbourhood of these Towns are many pleasant Seats of  Cornish  Gentry who are indeed very numerous and the most sociable generous and kind Neighbours to one another that are to be found and usually intermarry among themselves from whence they say the Proverb  That all the  Cornish  Gentlemen are Cousins  It is the very same in  Wales  where the greatest Compliment that one Gentleman can make to another of the same County is to call  him Cousin There is a great Conformity of Manners Customs and Usages between the  Welsh  and  Cornish  who are accounted of the same Origin and Descendants also of the antient  Britons  and there is likewise a great Affinity between the old  Cornish  and  Welsh  Language  On the Hills North of  Leskard  and in the Way between that Town and  Launceston  are many Tin Mines and some of the richest Veins of that Metal in the whole County which when cast at the Blowinghouses into Blocks are sent to  Leskard  to be coined  From  Leskard  in our Course West we are necessarily carried to the Seacoast because of the River  Fowey  which empties itself into the Sea at a very large Mouth and hereby this River rising in the Middle of the Breadth of the County and running South and the River  Camel  rising not far from it and running North with a like large Chanel the Land from  Bodmyn  to the Western Part of the County is almost made an Island and in a manner cut off from the Eastern the Isthmus or Neck of Land between being not above Twelve Miles over  In the Parish of  St Cleer  is a Piece of Antiquity which they call  The other Halfstone  which are indeed Two Stones fixed in the Ground and by Mortaises in each they seem to have been heretofore joined together Both of them were curiously wrought by Diaperworkcarvings but one of them hath an Inscription in very antique Characters as follows  inscription on stone  Which seem to express thus much  Doniert Rogavit pro Anima  implying that  Dungarth  or  Doniert  King of  Cornwall  who was drown'd  A D  gave this Land for the Good of his Soul  Not far distant is a Heap of large Stones under which lies a great Stone fashioned like a Cheese and seems to the Eye as if it were press'd into that Form by the Weight that lies upon it and hence they call it  Wringcheese    On the South from  Leskard  we come to  Foy  or  Fowey  an antient Boroughtown and formerly very large and potent for the  Foyens  as they were then call'd were able to fit out large Fleets not only for Merchants Ships but even of Men of War and with these not only fought with but several times vanquished and routed the Squadron of the Cinqueport Men who in those Days were very powerful  Mr  Camden  observes that the Town of  Foy  quarters some Part of the Arms of every one of those Cinqueports with their own intimating that they had at several times triumph'd over them all and indeed they were once so powerful that they fitted out their Fleets against the  French  and took several of their Men of War when they were at Variance with  England  and enriching their Town by the Spoil of their Enemies  Edward  IV favour'd them much and because the  French  threaten'd to come up their River with a powerful Navy to burn their Town he caused Two Forts to be built at the publick Charge for its Security the Ruins of which are still to be seen but the same King  Edward  was some time after so disgusted at the Townsmen for officiously falling upon the  French  after a Truce was proclaimed that he effectually disarmed them took away their whole Fleet Ships Tackle Apparel and Furniture and since that time we do not read of any of their Naval Exploits nor that they ever attempted to recover their Strength at Sea However  Foy  at this time is a very fair Town it lies extended on the East Sid of the River for above a Mile the Buildings fair and there are a great many flourishing Merchants in it who have a great Share in the Fishingtrade especially for Pilchards In this Town is also a Coinage for the TIN of which a great Quantity is dug up in the Country North and West of the Town The Church at  Fowey  is antient and very fine  The River  Fowey  which is very broad and deep here was formerly very navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as the Boroughtown of  Lestwithiel  an antient and once a flourishing but now a decay'd Place and as to Trade and Navigation quite destitute which is occasioned by the River being filled up with Sand  Lestwithiel  was called in the  British  Times  Pen Uehel Coed  i e an high Place with Wood It became since the antient Residence of the Dukes of  Cornwall  The Ruins of a Castle belonging to them are still to be seen on a rising Ground at a little Distance from the Town The Church is an handsome Edifice but the Steeple carries the Marks of the Civil Wars in the Reign of  Charles  I when the great Hall and Exchequer of the said Dukes of  Cornwall  were also utterly defaced Some say this  Town was formerly the County Town and still retains several Advantages which supports its Figure as That it is one of the Coinage or Stannary Towns The common Gaol for the whole Stannary is here as are also the County Courts for  Cornwall    There is a mock Cavalcade kept up at this Town which is very remarkable the Particulars as they are related by Mr  Carew  in his  Survey  of  Cornwall  take as follows  "Upon little  Easter Sunday  the Freeholders of this Town and Manor by themselves or their Deputies did there assemble amongst whom one as it fell to his Lot by turn bravely apparell'd gallantly mounted with a Crown on his Head a Sceptre in his Hand and a Sword borne before him and dutifully attended by all the rest also on Horseback rode thro' the principal Street to the Church the Curate in his best  Beseen  solemnly received him at the Churchyard Stile and conducted him to hear Divine Service After which he repaired with the same Pomp to a House provided for that Purpose made a Feast to his Attendants kept the Table'send himself and was served with kneeling Assay and all other Rights due to the Estate of a Prince with which Dinner the Ceremony ended and every Man returned Home again The Pedigree of this Usage is deriv'd from so many Descents of Ages that the Cause and Author outreach Remembrance Howbeit these Circumstances afford a Conjecture that it should betoken Royalties appertaining to the Honour of  Cornwall  "  Behind  Foy  and nearer to the Coast at the Mouth of a small River which some call  Loe  tho' without any Authority stand Two Boroughtowns opposite to one another bearing the Name of  East Loe  and  West Loe  These are both good trading  Towns and especially for Fish and which is very particular are like  Weymouth  and  Melcomb  in  Dorsetshire  separated only by the Creek or River and yet each of them sends Members to Parliament These Towns are joined together by a very beautiful and stately Stone Bridge having Arches  East Loe  was the antienter Corporation of the Two and some Ages ago the greater and more considerable Town but now they tell us  West Loe  is the richest and has the most Ships belonging to it but has neither Church or Chapel nor Meetinghouse in it Were they put together they would make a very handsome Seaport Town  Passing from hence and ferrying over  Foy  River we come into a large Country without many Towns in it of Note but very well furnished with Gentlemens Seats and a little higher up with Tin Works  The Sea making several deep Bays here they who travel by Land are obliged to go higher into the Country to pass above the Water especially at  Trewardrethbay  which lies very broad above Ten Miles within the Country which passing at  Trewardreth  a Town of no great Note tho' the Bay takes its Name from it the next Inlet of the Sea is the famous  Firth  or Inlet called  Falmouth Haven  It is certainly next to  Milford Haven  in  South Wales  the fairest and best Road for Shipping that is in the whole Isle of  Britain  whether we consider the Depth of Water for above Miles within Land the Safety of Riding shelter'd from all kind of Winds or Storms the good Anchorage and the many Creeks all navigable where Ships may run in and be safe  There are Six or Seven very considerable Places upon this  Haven  and the Rivers from it  viz Grampound Tregony Truro Penryn Falmouth St Mawes  and  Pendennis  The Four first of these send Members to Parliament altho' the Town of  Falmouth  as big as all of them together  Truro  excepted  and richer than Ten such sends none But how so considerable a Seaport and Town comes to be debarr'd that Privilege doth not appear 'Tis certain that a great Number of small inconsiderable Boroughs in this County do now enjoy it but until the th of  Edward  VI none but  Launceston Leskard Lestwithiel Truro Bodmyn Helston  and  Bossiney  sent any And whether it were then imposed on the rest as a Punishment or conferred as a Favour is uncertain I cannot agree with those who think it was obtain'd at their Request by the Interest of their Duke because they were invested with it by King  Edward  VI and Queen  Elizabeth  when no Person bore that Title  St Mawes  and  Pendennis  or  Pendinas  which signifies in the old  British  the End or Head of a City are Two Fortifications placed at the Points or Entrance of this  Haven  opposite to one another tho' not with a Communication or View They are very strong the former principally by Sea having a good Platform of Guns pointing 'thwart the Chanel and planted on a Level with the Water but  Pendennis  Castle is strong by Land as well as by Water is regularly fortified has good Outworks and generally a strong Garison and each of them has a Governor  St Mawes  otherwise called  St Mary  's has a Town annex'd to the Castle and is a Borough sending Members to Parliament but has neither Church Chapel Meetinghouse Fair or Market in it  The Town of  Falmouth  is by much the richest and best trading Town in this County tho' not so antient as its Neighbour Town of  Truro  and indeed is in some things obliged to acknowlege its Seigniority and the  Truro  Men receive several Duties collected in  Falmouth  particularly Wharfage for the Merchandizes landed or shipped off but the  Town of  Falmouth  has gotten the Trade at least the best Part of it from the other which is chiefly owing to the Situation for lying upon the Sea but within the Entrance Ships of the greatest Burden come up to the very Quay and the whole Royal Navy might ride safely in the Road whereas the Town of  Truro  lying far within and at the Mouth of Two fresh Rivers is not navigable for Vessels of above Tons or thereabouts the Trade at  Truro  being chiefly if not altogether for the Shipping off of Block TIN and COPPER Ore the latter being lately found in large Quantities in some of the Mountains between  Truro  and  St Michael's  and which is much improv'd since the several Mills are erected at  Bristol  and other Parts for the Manufactures of Batteryware as 'tis called  Falmouth  is wellbuilt has abundance of Shipping belonging to it is full of rich Merchants and has an increasing Trade because of the setting up of late Years the  English  Packets between this Port and  Lisbon  which occasions a new Commerce between  Portugal  and this Town amounting to a very great Value  It is true Part of this Trade was founded in a clandestine Commerce carried on by the said Packets at  Lisbon  where being the King's Ships and claiming the Privilege of not being searched or visited by the Customhouse Officers they found Means to carry off great Quantities of  British  Manufactures which they sold on Board to the  Portuguese  Merchants and they convey'd them on Shore as 'tis supposed without paying Custom  But the Government there getting Intelligence of it and Complaint being made in  England  also where it was found to be prejudicial to the fair Merchant that Trade has been effectually stopp'd but the  Falmouth  Merchants having by this means gotten a Taste of the  Portuguese  Trade have maintained it  ever since in Ships of their own These Packets bring over vast Quantities of Gold in Specie either in  Moidores  or in Bars of Gold on Account of the Merchants at  London    The Customhouse for all the Towns in this Port and the Headcollector is established at this Town where the Duties including those of the other Ports are very considerable Here is also a very great Fishing for  Pilchards  and the Merchants of  Falmouth  have the chiefest Stroke in that gainful Trade  Truro  tho' it gives Place to  Falmouth  is however a considerable Town It stands up the Water Northandbyeast from  Falmouth  in the utmost extended Branch of the Haven at the Conflux of Two Rivers which tho' not of any long Course have a very good Appearance for a Port and make a large Wharf between them in the Front of the Town and the Water here makes a very good Port for small Ships tho' it be at the Influx but not for Ships of Burden There are at least Three Churches in it but no Dissenters Meetinghouse that I could hear of  Tregony  or  Tregenen  which in  British  signifies the Mouthtown is a Boroughtown upon the same Water Northeast from  Falmouth  distant about Miles from it but is a Town of very little Trade nor indeed have any of the Towns so far within the Shore notwithstanding the Benefit of the Water any considerable Trade but what is carried on under the Merchants of  Falmouth  or  Truro    Grampound  is a Markettown and Borough about Four Miles farther up the Water This Place indeed has a Claim to Antiquity and is an Appendix to the Duchy of  Cornwall  of which it holds at a Freefarm Rent and pays to the Prince of  Wales  as Duke  l    s    d per Annum  It has no Parishchurch but only a Chapel of Ease to an adjacent Parish Here are some Remains to be seen  of the famous  Coedfala  which in the  British  signifies  Felonwood  granted with all the Lands in it to the Town in King  Edward  III's Time  Penryn  another Boroughtown is up the same Branch of the Haven as  Falmouth  but stands Four Miles higher towards the West upon a Hill yet Ships come to it of as great a Size as can come to  Truro  It is a very pleasant agreeable Town and for that Reason has many Merchants in it who would perhaps otherwise live at  Falmouth  The chief Commerce of these Towns as to their Seaaffairs is the Pilchards and  Newfoundland  Fishing which is very profitable to them all It had formerly a Conventual Church with a Chantry and a Religious House a Cell to  Kirton  but they are all demolished and scarce the Ruins of them distinguishable enough to know one Part from another This Town is full of Orchards and looks like a Town in a Wood The Sea embraces it on each Side Its Name is  British  as all those Words beginning with  Pen  and  Tre  and  Lan  which occur often in this County are  Quitting  Falmouth  Haven from  Penryn  West we came to  Helston  another Boroughtown at about Seven Miles Distance It stands upon the little River  Cober  which however admits the Sea so into its Bosom as to make a tolerable good Harbour for Ships a little below the Town It is the Fifth Town allowed for the Coining TIN and several of the Ships called  Tin  Ships are laden here  This Town is large and populous and has Four spacious Streets an handsome Church and a good Trade Beyond this is a Markettown tho' of no Resort for Trade called  MarketJew  it lies indeed on the Seaside but has no Harbour or safe Road for Shipping  At  Helford  is a small but good Harbour between  Falmouth  and this Port where many times the  TIN Ships go in to load for  London  also here are a good Number of Fishing Vessels for the  Pilchard  Trade and abundance of skilful Fishermen  Pensance  in  British Pensand  i e the Head or End of the Sand is the farthest Town of any Note West being Miles from  London  and within about Ten Miles of the Promontory called the  Land'send  so that this Promontory is from  London  Miles or thereabouts This is a Markettown of good Business wellbuilt and populous has a good Trade and a great many Ships belonging to it notwithstanding it is so remote Here are also a great many good Families of Gentlemen tho' in this utmost Angle of the Nation and which is yet more strange the Veins of Lead Tin and Copper Ore are said to be seen even to the utmost Extent of Land at Lowwater Mark and in the very Sea So rich so valuable a Treasure is contained in these Parts of  Great Britain  tho' they are supposed to be very poor because so remote from  London  which is the Centre of our Wealth  Between this Town and  St Burien  a Town midway between it and the  Land'send  stands a circular Temple of the  Druids  consisting of Stones the Distance between each being Feet and a th in the Centre much higher than the rest and are not unlike those at  Stonehenge  in  Wiltshire  The Parish where they stand is called  Biscardwoune  from whence the antient and now noble Family of  Boscawen  derives its Name  In  Cleer  Parish in this County Six or Eight Stones of prodigious Bigness likewise stand up in a Circle a Monument of the like Nature  These are probably as those at  Stonehenge  and  Burien  Remains of  Druids  Temples  And we shall mention in this Place that at  Stantondrew  in  Somersetshire  is another Temple of the  Druids  called  The Weddings    The  Maenamber  near this Town of  Pensance  was also a very remarkable Stone which as Mr  Camden  tells us tho' it be of a vast Bigness yet might be moved with one Finger notwithstanding a great Number of Men could not remove it from its Place It was destroy'd as one of the same Sort was in  Fifeshire Scotland  by one of  Oliver  's Governors for these Reformers had a Notion of these Works being of a superstitious kind  Maen  is a  British  Word for a great Stone There is one of these Stones as Dr  Stukely  tells us in  Derbyshire  and Mr  Toland  acquaints us that there are also such in  Ireland  as well as  Wales  he gives the following Account of this Piece of Antiquity  "At a Place called  Maenamber  says he is a Heap of Stones roundish and of vast Bulk but so artificially pitch'd on flat Stones sometimes more sometimes fewer in Number that touching the great Stone lightly it moves and seems to totter to the great Amazement of the Ignorant but stirs not at least not sensibly when one uses his whole Strength"  Near  Pensance  but open to the Sea is that Gulph they call  Mountsbay  named so from a high Hill standing in the Water which they call  St Michael's Mount  the Seamen call it only  the Cornish Mount  It has been fortify'd tho' the Situation of it makes it so difficult of Access that like the  Bass  in  Scotland  there needs no Fortification Like the  Bass  too it was once made a Gaol for Prisoners of State but now it is wholly neglected Here is a very good Road for Shipping which makes the Town of  Pensance  a Place of good Resort  A little up in the Country towards the Northwest is  Godolchan  which tho' a Hill rather than a Town gives Name to the antient and now noble Family of  Godolphin  and nearer on the Northern Coast is  Ryalton  which gives the second Title to the Earl  Godolphin  This Place also is infinitely rich in  Tin  Mines  But I must not end this Account at the utmost Extent of the Island of  Great Britain  West without visiting those kind of  Excrescences  of the Island the Rocks of  Scilly  where many good Ships are almost continually dashed in Pieces and many brave Lives lost in spite of the Mariner's best Skill or the Lighthouses and other Seamarks best Notice  These Isles called in  Latin Silurum Insulae  are supposed by some to be the  Cassiterides  of the Antients they lie about Miles from the  Land'send  and are a Cluster of small Islands to the Number as some reckon of  Scilly  was once the chief in Estimation But  St Mary  being the fruitfullest and largest tho' but Nine Miles about has now the Preeminence and it has a very good Harbour fortify'd with a Castle built by Queen  Elizabeth  These Isles were conquer'd by  Athelstane  one of the  Saxon  Kings and from his Time they are deemed a Part of the County of  Cornwall    These Islands lie so in the Middle between the Two vast Openings of the North and South narrow Seas or as the Sailors call them the  Bristol Chanel  and  The Chanel  so called by way of Eminence that it cannot or perhaps never will be avoided but that several Ships in the Dark of the Night and in Stress of Weather may by being out in their Reckonings or other unavoidable Accidents mistake and if they do they are sure as the Sailors call it to run  Bump ashore  upon  Scilly  where they find no Quarter among the Breakers but are beat to pieces without any Possibility of Escape  One can hardly mention the Rocks of  Scilly  without letting fall a Tear to the Memory of Sir  Cloudesly Shovel  and all the gallant Spirits with him who in the Admiral Ship with Three Men of War and all their Men running upon these Rocks right afore  the Wind in a dark Night were lost and not a Man saved in his Return from a fruitless Expedition against  Toulon    They tell us of Eleven Sail of Merchant Ships Homewardbound and richly laden from the Southward who had the like Fate in the same Place a great many Years ago and that some of them coming from  Spain  and having a great Quantity of Bullion or Pieces of Eight on board the Money frequently drives on Shore still and that in good Quantities especially after stormy Weather  This may be the Reason why as we observed during our short Stay here several Mornings after it had blown something hard in the Night the Sands were covered with Country People running to and fro to see if the Sea had cast up any thing of value This the Seamen call  going a shoring  and it seems they often find good Purchace Sometimes also dead Bodies are cast up here the Consequence of Shipwrecks among those fatal Rocks and Islands as also broken Pieces of Ships Casks Chests and almost every thing that will float or roll on Shore by the Surges of the Sea  Nor is it seldom that the savage Country People scuffle and fight about the Right to what they find and that in a desperate manner so that this Part of  Cornwall  may truly be said to be inhabited by a fierce and ravenous People like those on the Coast of  Sussex  for they are so greedy and eager for Prey that they are charged with strange bloody and cruel Dealings even sometimes with one another but especially with poor distressed Seamen when they are forced on Shore by Tempests and seek Help for their Lives and where they find the Rocks themselves not more merciless than the People who range about them for their Prey  Here also as a farther Testimony of the immense Riches which have been lost at times upon this Coast  we found several Engineers and Projectors with Diving Engines attempting to recover what had been lost and that not always unsuccessfully  From the Tops of the Hills on this Extremity of the Land you may see out into what they call the  Chaps of the Chanel  which as it is the greatest Inlet of Commerce and the most frequented by Merchant Ships of any Place in the World so one seldom looks out to Seaward but something new presents of Ships passing or repassing either on the great or lesser Chanel  This Point of the  Lizard  which runs out to the Southward and the other Promontory mentioned above make the Two Angles or Horns as they are called from whence 'tis supposed this Country received its first Name of  Cornwall  or as Mr  Camden  says  Cornubia  in the  Latin  and in the  British Kerneu  as running out in two vastly extended Horns  The  Lizard  Point is still more useful tho' not so far West than the other which is more properly called the  Land'send  being more frequently first discovered from the Sea and is therefore the general Guide and the Land which the Ships chuse to make first being then sure that they are past  Scilly    Nature has fortify'd this Part of the Island of  Britain  in a strange manner and so as is worth a Traveller's Observation  First there are the Islands of  Scilly  and the Rocks about them which are placed like Outworks to resist the first Assaults of this Enemy the Ocean and so break the Force of it as the Piles or Stirlings as they are called are placed before the solid Stonework of  Londonbridge  to fence off the Force either of the Water or Ice or any thing else that might be dangerous to the Work  Then there are a vast Number of  sunk Rocks  so the Seamen call them besides such as are visible and  above Water which gradually lessen the Quantity of Water that would otherwise lie with an infinite Weight and Force upon the Land 'Tis observed that these Rocks lie under Water for a great way off into the Sea on every Side the said Two Horns or Points of Land so breaking the Force of the Water and lessening the Weight of it  But besides this the whole  Terra Firma  or Body of the Land which makes this Part of the Isle of  Britain  seems to be one solid Rock as if it was formed by Nature to resist the otherwise irresistible Power of the Ocean And indeed if one was to observe with what Fury the Sea comes on sometimes against the Shore here especially at the  Lizard Point  where there are but few if any Outworks as I call them to resist it how high the Waves come rolling forward storming on the Back of one another particularly when the Wind blows  off Sea  one would wonder that even the strongest Rocks themselves should be able to resist and repel them But as I said the Country seems to be one great Body of Stone and prepar'd so on purpose  And yet as if all this was not enough Nature has provided another strong Fence and that is that these vast Rocks are in a manner cemented together by the solid and weighty Ore of TIN and COPPER especially the latter which is plentifully found upon the very outmost Edge of the Land and with which the Stones may be said to be solder'd together lest the Force of the Sea should separate and disjoint them and breaking in upon these Fortifications of the Island destroy its chief Security  This is certain that there is a more than ordinary Quantity of Tin Copper and Lead also fixed by the Great Author of Nature in these very remote Angles so that the Ore is found upon the very Surface of the Rocks a good way into the Sea and does not only lie as it were upon or between the Stones among the  Earth which in that Case might be wash'd from it by the Sea but is even blended or mix'd in with the Stones themselves so that the Stones must be split into Pieces to come at it By this Mixture the Rocks are made exceedingly weighty and solid and thereby still the more qualified to repel the Force of the Sea  Upon this remote Part of the Island we saw great Numbers of that famous kind of  Crows  which is known by the Name of the  Cornish Chough  they are the same kind which are found in  Switzerland  among the  Alps  and which  Pliny  pretended were peculiar to those Mountains and calls the  Pyrrhocorax  The Body is  Black  the Legs Feet and Bill of a  Yellow  almost to a  Red  I could not find that it was affected for any good Quality it had nor is the Flesh good to eat for it feeds much on Fish and Carrion it is counted little better than a Kite for it is of a ravenous Quality and is very mischievous it will steal and carry away any think it finds about the House that is not too heavy tho' not fit for its Food as Knives Forks Spoons and Linen Cloths or whatever it can fly away with sometimes they say it has stolen Bits of Firebrands or lighted Candles and lodged them in the Stacks of Corn and the Thatch of Barns and Houses and set them on Fire  I might take up many Sheets in describing the valuable Curiosities of this little  Chersonese  called the  Land'send  in which lies an immense Treasure and many Things worth Notice besides those to be found upon the Surface but I am too near the End of this Letter If I have Opportunity I shall take Notice of some Part of what I omit here in my Return by the Northern Shore of the County In the mean time  I am  c  The END of VOL I  INDEX TO THE FIRST VOLUME  A  ABbotsbury  Page    Addenbroke  Dr    Addington  Alcocke  Bishop of  Ely  Ald  River    Aldburgh  ibid  Aldermaston  Aldham Common
