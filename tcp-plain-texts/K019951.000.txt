 OCCASIONAL STANZAS WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE REVOLUTION SOCIETY AND RECITED ON THEIR ANNIVERSARY NOVEMBER  TO WHICH IS ADDED QUEEN MARY TO KING WILLIAM DURING HIS CAMPAIGN IN IRELAND A POETICAL EPISTLE  BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVIII PRICE TWO SHILLINGS  Entered at Stationers Hall  DEMOSTHENES pro Rhodiorum Libertate  OCCASIONAL STANZAS c  I  Dear is the face of cloudless night  And dear each radiant starry guide  To men whom science and renown invite  To steer the venturous bark thro' seas untried  So dear to every generous race  The lustre beaming from their fires  Whose distant deeds 'tis ecstacy to trace  Whose fame reechoing from unnumber'd lyres  Grows with increasing time and every age inspires  II  Amid wild nature's rudest reign  That dauntless COOK's keen eye survey'd  The veriest savage of the Southern main  The debt of just commemoration paid  He sung of buried Chiefs in whom  Young valour might a model see  Britain blest isle where social virtues bloom  Reflect what honours must be due from thee  To those who knew thee brave and taught thee to be free  III  Is it an art of curious care  To guard the rights deriv'd from God  And will not Valour's native impulse tear  From Tyranny's weak grasp Oppression's rod  Thus ardent youth perchance may ask  But patient toil from age to age  When Fortitude and Wisdom plied the task  The toil of many a chief and many a sage  Secur'd not Freedom's Fane from Superstition's rage  IV  In vain the Barons bravely fix'd  The groundwork of that glorious Fane  In vain when Faith with Papal art unmix'd  Shed Heav'n's pure radiance on this fair domain  Th' enlighten'd spirits of our isle  True heirs of Freedom's ancient race  With ardour added to her stately pile  Columns of clearer vein and firmer grace  The dome their virtue deck'd was shaken to its base  V  Recall'd by an apostate King  The fiends long banish'd hence return  To poison Liberty's lifefeeding spring  And taint the stream of Truth's celestial urn  The basest of the hellish horde  Barbarity with pride assumes  From fainting Justice her polluted sword  While Superstition mad with Fortune's fumes  Shakes on the darken'd throne her blooddistilling plumes  VI  O'erwhelm'd where most her bounty smil'd  Astonish'd Freedom gasp'd for breath  And her sunk voice was feeble as a child  In its first struggle with untimely death  But the safe infant's vital sound  To the fond parent lost in fear  Lest haply newimparted life be drown'd  Is not more welcome more sublimely dear  Than Freedom's suppliant voice to Virtue's generous ear  VII  For Britain and for human kind  To raise the prostrate form of Law  Attentive Virtue held her seat enshrin'd  In thy unconquerable soul NASSAU  Heroes by victory more carest  The fiery bolts of war have hurl'd  And conquerors have liv'd of earth the pest  But Glory's self from all her flags unfurl'd  Counts not a name like thine a blessing to the world  VIII  Depress'd dishonour'd wrong'd enthrall'd  Withering in shame's soulblighting shade  To thee our deeplysuffering Country call'd  As innocence to Heaven secure of aid  For well she knew thy spirit's force  Which firm as a defensive tower  Checking outrageous devastation's course  Stood in thy Nation's dark despairing hour  The champion of Distress the scourge of lawless power  IX  Purest of princely names unsway'd  By base ambition's sordid springs  In thee the rescued world was richly paid  For the oppressive crimes of prouder kings  The Gallic despot in his dreams  Of wide unlimited controul  Tho' flattery rich in fancy's magic beams  Blazon'd him high on Glory's gorgeous roll  Sunk into dim eclipse beneath thy brighter soul  X  As in the seas where sultry air  The wildlytortuous wave imples  Hideous and hostile to the seaman's prayer  The watery column of perdition swells  Yet haply a corrective power  The vex'd and maddening waters feel  Tho' in their spiral force Fate seems to lower  The mass portentous to the vessel's weal  Dissolves at the approach of sciencepointed steel  XI  So rais'd by Bigotry's hot breath  And pregnant with unnumber'd woes  With every form of danger and of death  Here the strange bulk of Tyranny arose  And so when Freedom's darken'd isle  The baleful prodigy deplor'd  So brave NASSAU this sudden upstart pile  This public misery's tempestuous hoard  Dispers'd before the point of thy preserving sword  XII  Science Religion every power  Friendly to earth and true to Heaven  Exulted in the blest and bloodless hour  When Freedom's sceptre to thy sway was given  The probity that rul'd thy heart  And taught the fearful to rejoice  Scorning to awe with force or lure with art  Left rescu'd Liberty's reviving voice  To fix in free debate the sovereign of her choice  XIII  Conscious of all a monarch's care  And firm his duties to fulfil  Thy generous spirit with a guardian's air  Receiv'd the gift of her unbiass'd will  By Freedom crown'd for her thy life  That never fear'd the storms of Fate  Was freely stak'd in peril's distant strife  When arm'd with Gallic war's presumptuous weight  The recreant JAMES reclaim'd his abdicated state  XIV  The Boyne's proud banks with triumph ring  With sounds that tell to every land  That Freedom happy in her chosen king  Trusted her battle to no feeble hand  Nor victory's shouts that round thee rose  Nor flying terror's suppliant call  Prais'd thee NASSAU I like paeans from thy foes  When France who heard of one insidious ball  William had no sooner arrived than he rode along the side of the river in the sight of both armies to make his observations upon the field which was next day to determine James's fate and his own The enemy having observed him sit down upon the ground while he was writing notes of what he had observed sent into a field opposite to him two fieldpieces concealed in their centre and had orders to drop the cannon unperceived behind a hedge as they marched along these guns were deliberately aimed at his horses and when he mounted were discharged the balls killed several of his followers and one of them wounded himself in the shoulder a shout from the Irish camp rent the skies a report that he was killed instantly flew through Ireland and in an incredible short space of time reached Paris The guns of the Bastile were fired the city was illuminated and all men congratulated each other as upon the greatest of victories  DALRYMPLE Vol I p  Indulg'd a coward's joy on thy imagin'd fall  XV  While bleeding on Ierne's shore  England thy brave Deliverer fought  What various doubts thy anxious bosom tore  With what just fears was every moment fraught  But to preserve thee from dismay  He left a Regent pure and bright  And like the absent ruler of the day  That his sost delegate might chear the sight  Fill'd her benignant soul with his reflected light  XVI  MARY sweet partner of his throne  So truly to his spirit join'd  With mutual aid your mingled virtues shone  Like social talents in one perfect mind  To thee whom with thy martial Lord  Heav'n form'd to gild our darkest days  May tender Truth strike Honour's tuneful chord  As long as Freedom to her friends shall raise  Her high heroic hymn of heartsuggested praise  XVII  And O while crown'd with silvery clifts  Symbols of her commercial reign  Britain her fair imperial presence lifts  Above the billows of the subject main  So long array'd in Honour's robe  May Freedom hail each favourite name  Who taught this speck of earth to awe the globe  So long may Glory in her songs proclaim  The Champions of our Rights the Founders of our Fame  XVIII  Whether in Fortune's evil hour  They shar'd the martyr'd RUSSELL's fall  Or call'd like CA'NDISH to heroic power  And saw felicity succeed the call  Still Britain bless through every age  Each ardent friend of equal laws  And most the generous Chief and perfect Sage  NASSAU and SOMERS who in Freedom's cause  Toil'd to befriend mankind unbrib'd by their applause  XIX  That transient honour might be gain'd  How oft by Falsehood's subtle vow  Has thy pure name O Freedom been profan'd  Tho' Heaven abhors not falsehood more than thou  Thro' every clime thy feet have trod  In this abuse thy power we see  Miscreants who injur'd man and mock'd their God  The slaves of Hell affecting to be free  Have ever loudly feign'd a reverence for thee  XX  Be known to unsuspecting youth  Both by thy fruits and by thy source  Thy parents Fortitude and Heavenly Truth  Thy offspring Safety Honour Wealth and Force  A century has now confirm'd  The blessings that in thee we find  Then Freedom I be this season ever term'd  Thy Jubilee where no illusions blind  But justlyfounded joy invigorates the mind  XXI  Britain dear parent if to thee  My voice unstain'd by servile art  Pays reverence due and proud to hail thee free  Pours the true fervour of a filial heart  If thou hast ever rul'd my lyre  Thus let thy inspiration run  Let each who hears it catching Patriot fire  Prize above all by slavish interest won  The blessing to be prov'd thy undegenerate son  QUEEN MARY TO KING WILLIAM DURING HIS CAMPAIGN IN IRELAND  A POETICAL EPISTLE  ADVERTISEMENT  The following Poem was written several years ago and arose from the recent publication of the Queen's original and most interesing letters which Sir John Dalrymple inserted in the Appendix to his Memoirs of Great Britain The number of these letters amounts to thirtyseven they exhibit the character of this admirable woman in the most affecting point of view and fully justify all the praise that has been given to the tenderness of her heart and the dignity of her mind The Poem which is but a kind of echo to her genuine sentiments had been thrown aside with many other verses which the author has kept in privacy from the fear of trespassing too frequently on the indulgence of the public but he has been induced to print it with the preceding Stanzas from the idea that it may find favour in the sight of those who love to dwell at this particular season on the great characters which it attempts to delineate  QUEEN MARY TO KING WILLIAM  Once more reliev'd by midnight's welcome hour  From all the busy train of anxious power  My soul O WILLIAM from their bondage free  Joys in that freedom and is flown to thee  Like the poor Martyr in religion's cause  Who if the hand of Persecution pause  With Love devout with warmth of Prayer intense  Strains every thought and each recovering sense  Humbly to ask new spirit from his God  To bear each future pang of torture's rod  To thee I bend my succour and my pride  Whose love sustains me and whose counsels guide  While War that turns from hence his tide of blood  Bears thy great spirit on his swelling flood  Eager to end regardless of thy life  The wasting storm of sanguinary strife  While compass'd round with growing fears I stand  The trembling Guardian of this troubled land  While robb'd of thee whose animating sight  Turns doubt to joy and terror to delight  I feel instead of thy protecting care  Fear for thy lifethe worst of fears to bear  O may thy letters Ministers of Peace  Bid my vain terror for thy safety cease  O let them frequent fraught with love impart  Thy noble spirit to this weaker heart  Which yet too conscious of its failing power  Strains every nerve in each oppressive hour  To keep thy precious estimation still  Eager to find and happy to fulfil  Since from that source alone my pleasures spring  The dearest wishes of my distant King  In these hard scenes O give me to rejoice  In the kind sanction of thy partial voice  O grant my soul its honest pride to raise  On the strong basis of my WILLIAM's praise  From that alone my little strength I draw  Thy smile my glory and thy will my law  Think how this bosom at thy signet glows  Which I in agony of haste unclose  How to thy letter my fond eyes I glue  Till tears of transport intercept their view  Then to my heart those vital lines are prest  Which breathe new being thro' my fainting breast  In which thy soul from human fears refin'd  The brightest copy of th' Almighty mind  Yet kindly melts with reconciling care  In generous pity of the load I bear  Alas the burden of th' unbalanc'd state  Sinks my faint soul with its increasing weight  'Tis hard to keep the helm with this frail form  While men of sterner spirit dread the storm  Too weak this trembling hand that helm to guide  When smiling ocean spreads his smoothest tide  Think then what agony my bosom rends  When the sky darkens when the storm descends  When each great effort of the crew is crost  And frantic terror cries "The vessel's lost"  Yet yet I mount these cruel waves above  Buoy'd up by duty and superior love  Tho' icy terror freeze my female heart  Thy Consort yet sustains her trying part  Her features yet her Country's fears beguile  Cast o'er their doubts a confidential smile  Bid them the firmness of this bosom share  And boast of couragewhich I feel not there  Dear native Britain noble generous Land  Proud of that rescue which thy virtue plann'd  As yet but half redeem'd I mourn thy doom  To see thy glories shaken in their bloom  To see proud France with fatal power suspend  Thy great redemption and its peaceful end  While He whose saving hand thy laws proclaim  Whose sight is safety whose protection fame  By distant slaughter from thy shores debarr'd  Must leave thy honour to so weak a guard  Who tho' her soul thy sacred rights revere  Is still a feeble Being born to fear  E'en those O WILLIAM whom thy care assign'd  To sooth my terror and to shield my mind  Forget the weakness of my softer sex  With doubts alarm me with dissensions vex  And shew discolour'd by their dark surmise  Tremendous prospects to these aching eyes  Yet think not tamely I this breast resign  To Fear's suggestions so remote from thine  No when th' infernal spirit of Despair  Would seize my heart and fix his fetters there  I strive that circle from his power to free  And break his baleful spells by naming Thee  Those scenes more dreadful I recall to view  In which my Hero's infant glory grew  When trembling Holland first with transport saw  The stern atchievments of her young NASSAU  I see the moment when her prostrate shore  Heard all in vain her guardian waters roar  Above those bulwarks saw her fate advance  Her shame her ruin in the host of France  When all her sons would o'er th' Atlantic fly  And bear their Freedom to a brighter sky  Leaving those seats their fathers form'd of yore  In ocean buried and their name no more  When thus of every human aid bereft  E'en then thy Valour saidit still was left  To bid despotic Desolation strike  And fall with Freedom on her latest dyke  E'en then I see Thee undismay'd oppose  The rising deluge of thy Country's foes  Oppression's torrent stem with nobler force  And bid her flood roll backward to its source  See rescued millions on thy triumph wait  And hail thee Saviour of a sinking state  While this bright image of thy rising fame  Warms my fond heart and animates my frame  My melting soul thus pours with warmth like thine  Its adorations to the Throne Divine  Thou God of Justice whose sustaining power  Has watch'd my WILLIAM from his natal hour  O since thy mercy mark'd him at his birth  The just Avenger of the groaning earth  Since thy decrees to strike the world with awe  Have rais'd him Guardian of thy purest law  While injur'd nations in thy servant blest  Revive and see their wrongs by him redrest  Complete thy mercies and sustain him still  The glorious Agent of thy gracious will  And O since blest with his connubial care  'Tis mine the fortunes of his life to share  Since thy unquestionable mandates place  My weakness in a scene that asks thy grace  O let that grace with kind profusion flow  And teach this bosom with new life to glow  Heal every cruel wound of nature there  And bid my heart a stranger to despair  While the storm rages like the frighted Dove  Rest in the sacred ark of WILLIAM's love  Thus rapt in solitude in prayer retir'd  I find that succour which my soul requir'd  Peace in soft visions bids me sigh no more  And brings her olivewreath unstain'd with gore  But ah in vain these flattering visions rise  For other seenes salute my waking eyes  Men now when Sleep benignant Power would shed  His healing opiate on Assliction's head  Our citizens terrific vigils keep  And find that Tourville's name has murder'd sleep  England dishonour'd by her guardian fleet  With shame with anger feels her bosom beat  Our city's growing fears by rumour nurst  Rise into folly into frenzy burst  And frantic Fancy sees her captive spires  Sink in the blaze of Tourville's spreading fires  But fear O WILLIAM in my heart gives place  To keen sensations of this deep disgrace  Warm'd in thy bosom I from thence have caught  Some little portion of thy glorious thought  Of Honour's spirit Freedom's holy flame  Contempt of cowardice and scorn of shame  Unhappy England who hast mourn'd in vain  Thy coast dishonour'd by this naval stain  May thy white cliffs that tinge the silv'ry flood  Behold the stain effac'd in Gallic blood  And thou proud vessel of stupendous mould  Emblazing ocean with thy breadth of gold  Thou France's naval pride Imperial Sun  The name of Tourville's ship at that time the finest in the world  Swift o'er thy shrouds may flames of vengeance run  Thy boasted bulk may English thunders rend  And thy pale streamers to the deep descend  May Britons see while shouts of joy they raise  Thy gorgeous fabric in their lightnings blaze  And blazing shed on their illumin'd shore  Glories more bright than it eclips'd before  My bosom thus with love of England fraught  My spirits mount in that ennobling thought  Tho' a just God may check our erring pride  I still O WILLIAM in his care confide  Life safety peace from this idea springs  That thou art Soldier to the King of Kings  That thy great actions make his mercies known  Thy fame his glory and thy cause his own  But should that God a guilty world to awe  His chosen Warrior from its aid withdraw  Should HeBut hence distracting image hence  Nor shed thy poison on my wounded sense  Yet in these minutes that so slowly roll  When expectation fills the busy soul  And thinks each moment with our King to share  Conquest or ruin triumph or despair  Impatient Doubt with stronger Fear combin'd  Strikes from its center the unbalanc'd mind  Yet e'en these hours I labour to beguile  To make Suspence's frozen features smile  And from disquietude my heart to free  By thus unfolding all that heart to thee  He comes thy Courieron affection's wing  I fly to catch the tidings of my King  O joy O bounteous Heaven O blessed hour  Delight that drowns expression's feeble power  Great God of Battles whose high will has shed  This signal glory round my Hero's head  O while thy praise in hymns of triumph sung  Fills the glad earth forgive my faltering tongue  Survey my soul accept its silent prayer  And see thy mercies all engraven there  And thou my Lord my Life dear Victor say  What words my transport can to thee convey  I write but tears th' imperfect line destroy  And every thought dissolves in floods of joy  What aweful scenes what images arise  In swift succession to my wond'ring eyes  Thy wound now shakes my shudd'ring heart with fear  Thy shouts of victory now strike my ear  I see afflicted Angels staunch thy blood  I see thee plunge in Boyne's immortal flood  I see thee lift thy leading sword on high  The cruel sons of persecution fly  I see the routbut in that flying band  One sacred headO stretch thy saving hand  O for thy MARY's sake in mercy spare  Forgive this vain unnecessary prayer  The weakness of that heart with pity see  Which recommends Humanity to thee  As well might Man proud offspring of the dust  Enjoin the God of Justice to be just  For O my WILLIAM in thy godlike breast  Celestial Mercy is a constant guest  No vain ambitious fanguinary pride  No bigot fury is thy frantic guide  Heaven's purest law and Man's most sacred right  Lead thy mild spirit to the wasting fight  Like some pure Seraph who by Heaven enjoin'd  To search to punish to correct mankind  With sweet reluctance wields his flaming blade  With pity views the waste by Justice made  And pleas'd the voice of Penitence to hear  Drops on each wound a salutary tear  Such in the storm of war thy virtues shine  The welfare of the world thy great design  While Mercy bids admiring nations own  Thy sword her weapon and thy heart her throne  My love need only to thy thought commend  One dearer life which mighty God defend  For of the many lives that ask my prayer  None but thy own will want thy constant care  Learn from thy woundAlas its terrors still  Thro' Triumph's glowing bosom strike their chill  From thee protecting Heaven this boon I crave  From one the worst of woes thy servant save  Ne'er let me see condemn'd to lose my all  The Pillar of the Public Safety fall  Condemn'd to weep my guardian spirit flown  And wander thro' an empty world alone  Sooner much sooner let some kind disease  This yielding frame with baleful fury seize  These terms will reconcile my struggling breath  To the dread summons of impending death  Perchance when all my latest pangs have ceas'd  When this soft spirit is from earth releas'd  Perchance thy Guardian Angel may resign  The life of WILLIAM to a love like mine  O  kindly deign so dear a charge to share  And own I watch thee with a fonder care  O  shou'd th' allwise allgracious God decree  To rend by early death this frame from thee  To early death this consolation give  Say that I still shall in thy memory live  Nor there O WILLIAM not e'en there alone  O bid my fondness like thy fame be known  Let distant agesif not sunk in shame  Ages most distant must revere thy name  Let distant ages by thy virtue free  My love engrafted on thy glory see  Preserv'd from Time and Envy's hostile shock  To bloom immortal on that sacred stock  But Heaven yet seems indulgent to bestow  A lasting union on our loves below  Our promis'd meeting of dearbought delight  Fills my fond soul and dawns upon my sight  Thy foes dispers'd thy fainting friends reliev'd  All the great duties of thy sword atchiev'd  Thou hast no cause in distant realms to stay  And wound expecting fondness by delay  Come then blest Victor come our dear Defence  While strong impatience strains our aching sense  Soon let me clasp in thy embraces blest  My glorious Warrior to my glowing breast  Hang on thy lips and with delight explore  Thy great atchievments on Ierne's shore  Come thou prime care of the propitious Sky  Hither on Victory's rapid pinions fly  Fly to these arms and while from them disjoin'd  Still let this truth be present to thy mind  Th' allsearching Spirit in no heart can see  A love surpassing what I bear to thee  FINIS
