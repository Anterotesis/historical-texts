 AN INVITATION TO PEACE OR  TOBY  's Preliminaries TO  NESTOR IRONSIDES  Set forth in a DIALOGUE Between  TOBY  and his KINSMAN  Hor  Niger est Romana Caveto  Milt  Why did he not accept  Friendly Composure offer'd  LONDON  Printed and Sold by Mr  Lawrence  near St  Paul's  Churchyard  TOBY  's DIALOGUE With his KINSMAN  c  A  _COME Come Mr  Toby  Mr  Ironsides  offers very fair and if you don't come to an Accommodation what will the World say of you  T  Tell not me of Offers Accommodation and the World I say positively I will not hear of any Reconciliation till he shall make me such Proposals as may agree with my Safety and Honour And therefore I do insist that Fort  An  be demolish'd and that for our Security during the Negotiation it be put into the Hands of the Sieurs  Tooke  and  Barber  And if he refuse to do this I am determin'd  to hold it out and fight it to the last  Vid Cat  A  But Sir consider a little You began this PaperWar with no other View but supporting the Ballance of Pamphleteering and you have now as is evident reduc'd old  Ironsides  to so low a Condition that perhaps he may be glad upon any reasonable Terms to put an End to this long and bloody War yet Sir whether his Pen is so far subdued whether it be  wrought by ill Success to such a Submission  Vid Cat  is what I mightily doubt of Consider Sir I beseech you what a deal of Money that strong Fort has cost him how he has perpetually annoy'd you from that Coast and  T  Sir you may talk till Doomsday if you please but I shall make you no other Reply than Fort  Adson  Fort  Adson  A  All this is  tow'ring  Frenzy and Distraction  Vid Cat  and you talk as if you were sure of holding Fortune by the Forelock and of going down to the Grave with the Reputation you have now establish'd whereas there is nothing so difficult and uncertain Of this the Person you now so much despise is a fresh Instance How did the Force of his Pen in a few Months overrun your whole Country Did he not in three Weeks time take the strong Towns of  Fenwick  and  Cocoa  Politick CoffeeHouses used by the Tories and where Mr  Ironsides  us'd to go formerly and dispute  with many others Did he not attempt to force the  Examiner  that brave and experienc'd General out of his Lines and was he not very near effecting it This should learn you Sir some Humility and to put an end to your extravagant Way of Talking Besides Remember Sir  We took up Pens not to revenge our selves  But free the Commonwealth  Vid Cat  Now you have obtain'd this End you should hearken to Reason or else  the impartial World will say  and  T  When Fort  Ason  is once in my Hands I will then send him some Proposals which I think fit to make him subscribe as  Preliminaries  to our Treaty As First Sir  The Town of  Button  The Coffeehouse used by  Ironsides c  now Garrison'd by Wits shall be yielded up in the Condition 'tis now in with all its Dependences  The said Garrison shall have free leave to carry off their

Button  counting from the Time of signing this Treaty and that it shall be lawful for them to send for Dr  G  provided the said Dr  G  shall give good Security before such Persons as we shall appoint that he will not at any time nor upon any Consideration whatsoever offer to prescribe to any of our Subjects And also that the said Doctor shall not go arm'd with any  Epigram  or  Panegyrick  but that it shall be lawful for the said Doctor to wear what Epilogues and Songs he shall think fit provided the said Epilogues and Songs be neither lewd nor blasphemous  If at any time it shall happen that any Dispute or Quarrel shall arise between any of our Guards Officers or Domesticks  ie  Footmen and the said Mr  Ironsides  we do declare that we will not intermeddle in such Disputes or Quarrels but freely permit the Sieur  Ironsides  to pursue the said Quarrel as he shall think fit provided it be with such Decency as is usually observ'd among Footmen  We do also insist that all Freethinkers  ie  Atheists now inhabiting  Villa Graeca  do forthwith depart from our Dominions and that the said  Villa  be demolish'd in such Time and Manner as the Sieur  Bly  shall think fit  That the Province of Scandal be erected into a Principality and settled upon our dear Kinsman and Ally  Abel Roper  and  his Heirs for ever That the said Hereditary Succession be not invaded by Mr  Ironsides  either directly or indirectly by Word or Writing and that for the better Security the Expressions  Crisis publick Spirit liberal Education grave Man of Business as wise the best  c be hereafter never made use of unless in company with three or more Wits of his own Party in which case it shall be allow'd to commend himself as much as he shall think fit and the said Wits also may be allow'd to believe as much as they shall judge necessary  That the Sieur  Jacob  Librarian and Stationer to the Town of  Button  be permitted to reside in the said Town till such time as he shall have sold off all his Effects excepting such as shall be specify'd Contraband Goods by the present Treaty as all  Ambassadress's Speeches  c  That the said Sieur  Jacob  be not permitted to erect any publick Booth or Stage or expose to Sight any Lions Bears or other Monsters but that it shall be lawful for the said Sieur  Jacob  to keep open House on the Fifth of  November  and dance himself for the Diversion of any Number of  KitKats  or  Kitlings  not exceeding Forty  It shall also be permitted to the said  Jacob  to assist at the Buying Dressing and burning the  Pope Pretender  and as many  Cardinals  as shall be thought necessary provided the said  Pope Pretender  and  Cardinals  be bought dress'd and burnt by an equal Assessment and that there be always two or more antient and grave Persons of any Quality not exceeding an E to take care that there be no Riot or Indecency committed at the said Solemnity  The D of  Monue  bought a whole Pope at his own charge which was seiz'd by the Secretary of State  It shall not be permitted to burn Dr  Sacheverell  but it may be and is hereby lawful to burn the Reverend Dr  Tp  provided the said Kitlings will consent to burn two or more Preface Writers in company with him  Lastly we do insist that the  Englishman  alias  Ironsides  do at his own Expence cause forthwith to be printed a new Edition of  Cato  with a large Margin and a Hand in the said Margin pointing to such Lines in the said Play which in any way belong to the D of  M  and also there shall be another Hand of a different make which shall declare what Lines in the said Play do belong to Us or to our Kinsman and dear Ally  Abel Roper  We do also declare that the said Edition shall in a very sincere and open manner  ie  without any Equivocation or mental Reservation declare at what Lines in the said Tragedy of  Cato  the Sieur  Englishman  alias  Ironsides  with his Followers did not think fit to make a Noise  vg  overagainst the Verse  'Tis time to sheath the Sword and spare Mankind  Cat  it shall be expresly said  No Clap but a great Melancholy and some little Confusion  ITEM  Are not the Lives of those who draw the Sword  Intrusted to our Care  Cat  Another melancholy Look  Ditto  in two or three other Places which we think fit to reserve for the General Treaty But at  The Work of Ages  The Roman Empire's fallen  Cat  shall be a great Stamp follow'd with a Clap of two Minutes long  ITEM at  When Vice prevails and impious Men bear sway  The Post of Honour is a private Station  Cat  shall be printed  Biggest Clap  with a  NB  that several Kitlings swooned and that  Nic Lmere  was carried off for dead  NB  That in the said Play we do think fit to reserve to our own Use all such Lines as shall make mention of any laborious Virtue  vg Toil Hard Watching Abstinence Want of Food  c  And now Sir upon these Preliminaries I will consent to a Treaty and not otherwise  A  Modestly offer'd trulyPray what do you take Mr  Ironsides  for that you should think he would ever condescend to such Conditions  T  Take him for why for one of Mr  Congreve  's odd Fellows with a great deal of your little sort of Wit or if you please to let me give you his Character plainer for one who vainly imagines to become from a Bankrupt in Poetry a Haberdasher in Politicks or if this wont do I am sure he's like one of those Wise Men who laugh at a Fool's Advice which God knows is sometimes as fit to be follow'd as that of a Wit's  A  Why Sir I pray do you know of any Fool that can help out our Friend at a dead Lift for Faith as Affairs stand he seems to want it  T  Yes that I do and as I am a  publickspirited  Man and of a  liberal Education  I think my self bound to tell you and it is Sir the Fool in  Lear  A  And what says he  T  Saywhy he says  Let go thy Hold when a great Wheel runs down Hill lest it break thy Neck by following but the great one which goes upwards let it draw thee after  And then continues he  When a Wise Man gives you better Counsel give me mine again  A  Why truly I am of the Fool's Opinion and should be glad if others would not despise it but do you think Sir that Mr  Ironsides  who has been well bred a good Scholar and a topping Wit will ever strike Sail to a Fool  T  I know not that but I am sure now's the  Crisis  and the Remedy may prove too late if deferred Therefore prithee go to him and as from your self offer him some wholesome Counselit's pity the poor Fellow should be thrown away  A  E'en go your self for me for I have done with him It was but on Monday last when I went to see him at his Lodgings in hopes to perswade him to a Peace with you but  T  But what  A  What nay I am almost asham'd to tell you but when I knockt at the Door his Servant told me his Master was at home but not stirring and it was then past Eleven That he had had but a very bad NightI was afraid indeed he might have drunk some very bad Wine or eat something that did not agree with him somewhat too course for a Gentleman of a  fine Education  but his Servant soon set me right telling me he was sure his Master had had some Quarrel over Night for that he often started and call'd out upon  Toby  and the  Examiner  talk'd much of  Hereditary  Right  and ever and anon would cry out  Oh  Adn  and wilt thou leave me thus  Upon which account I immediately came away giving a strict Charge that all Swords Pistols and Penknives should be taken from him and in coming back  Do you see this  His Head was broke in going to visit Mr  Sle  T  Ay How came you by it  A  Why by a Riot which I very unfortunately fell into at my coming out of his House For you must know the Street where he lives is very far gone from the Doctrine he perpetually harrangues them with and 'tis ten to one if you pass it without meeting with some publick spirited Cobler or Taylor who very insolently will give you a Justle into the Kennel shou'd you offer at a Question he immediately tells you 'tis his Duty calls you  Tory  damns you for a  Jacobite  and so goes about his Business Nay even the Constables of his Parish have drunk so deep of his Cup that they make no scruple to declare to you that as they are Constables they are  accountable  to no Man but that all  England  is  accountable  to them and this they will tell you with an Air of Insolence All which is to go for nothing because forsooth at the End they cry  God bless the House of  Hanover as if it were impossible to say so without being impertinent sawcy and troublesome and somewhat else which deserves a worse Name And now I know where Mr  Ironsides  had his  accountable  and  unaccountable  T  No no I tell you the Constable had it of Mr  Ironsides  and not Mr  Ironsides  of the Constable tho' the Constable indeed is one that understands publick Affairs very well Besides Mr  Ironsides  does not absolutely say that he is not accountable to any body whatsoever but that he is not accountable so far as he is a Member of Parliament or rather so long as he shall be Out of that Capacity he well knows  he is accountable  how much and to whom and that as soon as he shall cease to be the Representative of  Stockbridge  and how soon that will happen God knows This Account must begin  A  Well I'll take care and distinguish You see however the Constable will have no Reserve But tell me Mr  Toby  for you are a very generous Enemy will you not have some Pity when that Day shall come  T  What Day  A  Why the Day of AccountsPoor Mr  Ironsides  how will he then wish his publick Spirit had been less and his private Oeconomy more That he had never heard of  Dunkirk  That he had never known the Importance of it And  T  How will he then wish he had retir'd betimes  To his paternal Seat the  Sabine  Field  Where his great Ancestors told with their own Hands  c  Vid Cat  His Qualification  if he has  any would have been enough to have entitl'd him to the Office of Justice of Peace and he might have liv'd and dy'd with a moderate Reputation  A  O  Dunkirk Dunkirk  T  Ah that cursed PortBut why did he not mind his Business and leave Politicks to those who knew what to do with them I had not then meddled with him But let him thank himself for it I have washt my Hands  A  Well I wish to God he would accept of your Offers tho' they are hard and come to a friendly Composition for really he has been a Fellow of pretty Parts  T  Has beenTrue  but is no more  We allow as a  Tatler  or  Spectator  or as he was now and then a Piece of one he had much Merit  In ev'ry  Spec  his tow'ring Wit did soar  And he was more admir'd and more and more  Spec  lost in Politicks by all is mourn'd  His Brain alas the  important Port  has turn'd  O would he choose some  fitter  Themein Pastorals  Declare if  Philips  or if  Pope  excells  Or else translate some Mother in Distress  For he grows less a Wit and less and less  And this is the best Advice I can give him which if he will do and grant me my Preliminaries with a very little more which I intend to ask he shall have Peace and Rest if not  A  But Mr  Toby  are you sure Mr  Ironsides  is fallen so low  T  Fallen ay ay prithee look on this  Pulls out his  Englishman  A  Hey de what's here  Reads  Villain Knave Rogue Fort Dunkirk Business all for the Pretender an undeniable Argument my Duty true Light House of Hanover Succession and Constitution  c Why this is never Mr  Sl  T  Nay if you can get any body else to Father it I am mistaken  A  What this Mr  Ironsides  T  Ay even ThatYou may look as wild as you please so it is  "And alas poor  Yorrick  I knew him  Horatio  a Fellow of infinite Jest most excellent Fancy He has born me upon his Back a Thousand times and how abhorr'd my Imagination is now my Gorge rises at itWhere be your Gibes now your Gamballs your Songs your Flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table in a RoarQuite chapfallen  c  And  thus Sir going a little farther perhaps we may trace the mighty  Ironsides  till we find him stopping a Bunghole  A  Now you are too curious  Toby  T  No no Faith I only do it to shew you  to how vile Uses we may return  A  By this last Speech Mr  Toby  it plainly appears the  Englishman  is quite dead  T  The World perhaps may take him for a dead Man and to say the Truth many an honest Man has been buried without half this Splutter but you must know Mr  Ironsides  can die  ie  be dull with a Design  Vid Spec  when he pleases for Eight or Ten Days and be never the worse for it But be assur'd whenever this Fancy comes into his Head there's some plaguy Plot at the bottom  A  Come Mr  Toby  never fear his rising again  Clamatum est  so e'en a done with your Treaty What you won't negotiate with a dead Man  T  I tell you he is not dead he is only dozing a little that his Wit may awake like  Cato  's Soul  Renew'd in all its Strength and take its flight  And be a Match for  Toby    Cat  A  Away you are too severe now what can't Mr  Addn  escape you But Sir give me leave to tell you if you go on at this rate to play the Ridicule with  Shakespear  and patch up a Buffoon from the Tags of Sentences no one is secure And will any one think you sit tame under such an Indignation In the Name of common Sense what do you take Mr  Sl  's Publick Spirit for  T  Take it for why for the foul Fiend in  Lear  which leads through Fire and through Flame through Sword and Whirlpool o'er Bog and Quagmire that hath laid Knives under his Pillow and which perhaps may  lay a Halter in his Pue  A  If this be the Case for God's sake some Charity for poor  Dick  whom the fou Fiend vexesBut why eternally upon Plays  T  Oh because 'tis the modish way of drawing a Character and was first set on foot  by a Gentleman that understands the World  very well  A  Enough enough I understand you Him you mean who drew his General from  Cato  T  Yes and from  Thunder  and  Lightning  and  Scipio  and a  great Rock  and a  destroying Angel  and from  Hannibal  and him that beat  Hannibal  and from two and thirty  animate things  and  inanimate  without Number  A  Well I am glad however for one Reason for now I shall never want something to put me in mind of Mr  Ironsides  and I would not willingly forgot him 'Tis  but turning over  Shakespear  In the Comedy of  Errors  I immediately shall find him as also in  Much ado about Nothing  but sure I am when I come to  Love's Labour lost  I shall then naturally think of the Importance of  Dunkirk  which he writ only as he kindly tells us for the Love of his Fellow Subjects  T  Importance of  Dunkirk  away with that Trash  A  What is not every Man free to set up for a Politician especially when he is sure of his own Sufficiency and has all the Reason in the World to be under  Horrible Expectations  T  A Politician yes provided it be in his Study He may there indeed pull down and erect praise and condemn and in short make a Constitution Hereditary or Elective as he shall think fit but I must insist he has no Right openly to revile a Ministry because he likes not the Faces of those that compose it which perhaps may be as good as his own tho' not yet in Print in  Jacob  's Shop Besides Sir every Man in his way Mr  Ironsides  understands  Latin  understands the Classics has writ three Comedies  alias  Farces has din'd with a great Lord and been at the burning of several Popes but what has this to do with Government Mr  Dogget  I allow you may divert us in low Comedy but can never make a tolerable Figure with  the Buskin and TruncheonWhat I beseech you would Mr  Ironsides  think if  Will Pinkethman  should take a fancy to play  Cato  if at the beginning of the second Act he should rudely break in and disturb Mr  Booth  and his little Senate and talk of his  liberal Education  of his being a grave Man and fit for Tragedy sure neither  He  nor his Circle of Pupils could forgive such an Impertinence  A  Come come you are for stopping the Mouths of People and restraining the Liberty of the Press a sure Sign Mr  Toby  your Actions won't bear the Light  T  As for stopping Mr  Ironsides  's Mouth I don't think it of moment enough to go about it but you know Friend it would be less offensive were it somewhat more cleanly therefore I'll compound for washing it  A  Agreed and when 'tis wash'd what would you have next  T  Nay provided it be clean let him do what he will with itBut I advise him to return to his old inoffensive way of Life  A  What do you take him for a Spider You know he never spun out of his own Bowels or if he did he cannot spin to Eternity  T  Why e'en let him do as Spiders do gather up his Web and begin again  A  How do you mean  T  Mean why since his Store is exhausted let him give us the same a second and a third time that is let him do as the Players do for I cannot yet leave the Stage study the Tast of the Town and repeat that oftenest which he finds goes down best Let him daily put up a Bill and declare what he intends for our Diversion As for Example At the  Shakespears Head  on this present  Tuesday  being the th of this Instant will be reprinted  my Tatler  concerning  Mohocks  or  Whalebone Petticoats  Now and then he may put up  At the Desire  of several Persons of Quality of the HighChurch Party will be presented my  Tatler  about  Atheists  and  Immoralists  Or  At the Desire  of the Kitcat Club will be shewn my  Letter to a certain Lord  Reading a Peny and no Money to be return'd after the first Paragraph is read  A  All this is very pretty but really Sir these Trifles are not for Senators No we shall hear from Mr  Ironsides  in another mannerMr  Ironside  's first Speech in Parliament come a halfpeny a pieceOr else perhaps Mr  Ironside's  Dying Speech with a full Account of all those  Jacobites  who pass'd Sentence against him  T  That's as it shall happen but if they don't turn him out Woe be to them for he is about qualifying himself in such a Manner as will soon make him terrible  A  As how I pray you  T  Why 'tis said he will set out arm'd  Capapee  that is Sir he will have  Hdn  's Eloquence  Lre  's Modesty and  Wle  's Honesty if so beware of  Ironsides  A  'Slife Man if this be true he must to the  Tower  right or wrong or what will become of the present Ministry But more especially what will become of the  Lord  and his  Fool  T  I know not that but assure you he shall have my Consent to stay in and more than that you shall see I will take Leave of him in a very genteel Manner and whatever I may have shown him to be in this Dialogue I will allow him to be as followsIf this won't suffice let him give the Challenge as soon as he shall make himself ready and have at him at  Comedy Tragedy Panegyrick Songs Epigrams Elegys Catos Ballads  and  Lampoons  A clear Stage and no Quarter  To Mr IRONSIDES  'TWAS you who
