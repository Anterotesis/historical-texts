believe Mr  Cuningham  very constant if I had Faith enough to credit this Letter  Jeffry  What Complaints are here But 'tis the Stile that all young Lovers write  Jeff  Pray Madam believe me you know I am a Man of Integrity I cannot dissemble Let him write what he pleases If he did not love you do you think I'd tell you so  Phil  When he has Opportunity I must confess he says kind things to me  Jeff  Take my Word Madam my Master is not like other MenUnless he loves a Lady and loves her passionately too he never troubles himself to compliment her much  Phil  Never Yes  Jeffry  sometimes you know he compliments my Aunt  Jeff  That's a convincing Proof of his Love to you you cannot think him reduc'd to the Necessity of making Love to an antiquated Piece with design to know her otherwise than to obtain the Happiness of seeing you But I shall tell him Madam  Phil  Tell him I have receiv'd and read his Letter  Jeff  Is that all Madam  Phil  All Yes Are you not content with that  Jeff  Any indifferent Person that had Hands and could but read would have done as much as that  Phil  Well Tell him then in time perhaps I may  Jeff  My Master Madam can't endure to depend on a perhaps  Enter  Prudence  Pru  Quick quick up to your Chamber Madam  Phil  What's the Matter Is my Aunt coming hither  Pru  She's at your Heels Go up the BackStairs quickly  Phil  Farewel  Jeffry  Commend me to thy Master  Exit  Phil  Jeff  For what I beseech you Is not my Master bewitc'd to court a Lady a whole Year and she hardly tell him she loves him yet  Pru  Alas She's but a Novice Let me alone with her I'll order the Business so that if thy Master be discreet and passionate enough in his Expressions he wins her Heart I'll warrant you  Jeff  He can say nothing to her but that damn'd Aunt of hers is harkning to't still What Pleasure can she find in Love at Fifty  Pru  Fie  Jeffry  you must say Five and twenty  Jeff  I wonder any Woman can have the Impudence to live and trouble Mankind after that Age  Pru  There never was a Woman so old but she retain'd a good Opinion of her self  Jeff  Then she dresses her self so fantastically that all may see she strives to appear Young in defiance of Nature She is more gawdy in that she calls HalfMourning than a young Bride is on her WeddingNight The Devil's in her if she believes any one can love her 'Tis jeering her but to be commonly civil to her  Pru  A little Flattery fires her She believes all that is said to her And he that does not make love to her and compliment her shall not be twice admitted to her House  Jeff  O reverend Beauty on my Conscience if I would grease her Chops with a few Compliments she'd mump and smile upon me  Pru  No doubt on't  Jeff  When shall my Master have an Opportunity to speak freely to  Philadelphia  Pru  Mr  Lovemore  is thy Master's Friend and is better belov'd here than he imagines You must persuade him to amuse the Aunt that Mr  Cuningham  may have Convenience to court the Niece  Jeff  Mr  Lovemore  's tir'd with playing that part so often he is cloy'd with the Aunt and swears he'll have no more of her  Pru  I'm sure her Niece and I endure much more Tell him 'twill be Charity in him to relieve us  Jeff  'Twill be hard to persuade him to it  Pru  This old Lady of mine has languish'd for a young Husband ever since Sir  Oliver Laycock  dy'd She cares not what Estate he has or what Religion he's of so he be but young and lusty Where is the great Viscount  Sans Terre  thy Master told her of Methinks he's long a coming  Jeff  Some cross unlucky Business hinders him  Pru  She has lately receiv'd some Letters that have given a full Account of him  Jeff  So much the worse What is it  Pru  They say his Fortune is not very much but he is greatly born and very pleasant and that he is so great a Lover of Musick he has not a Servant but can Sing or Dance or Play upon some Instrument You may know when he's come by the Noise the Fiddlers will welcome him to Town for all from  Westminster  to  Wapping  pay him Homage  Jeff  Wou'd he were but marry'd to her  Prudence  Pru  Whether he marries her or not is not our Business  Jeffry  Let him but fool with us till thy Master has gain'd her Niece and then our Work is done  Jeff  Well we have had enough of thy old Lady  Laycock  Let us now talk of our own Affairs speak dost thou love me  Prudence  Pru  A pleasant Question Do you doubt it now  Jeff  If you would have me credit you swear it  Pru  Sure you are jealous  Jeffry  Jeff  You're somewhat near the Matter I know your Humour well enough you love a bold audacious Fellow that will say any thing and such a one we have come to Town one  Merryman  our Falconer I fear you'll like him better than you do me  Pru  Oh Fool why should you think so  Jeff  I have some Honour in me but he's a Fellow that has eaten Shame and drank after it He is more impudent than a Court Page and will take no Denial  Pru  Hold your Tongue here's my Lady  Enter Lady  Laycock  Lady  What Business has  Jeffry  with you  Pru  His Master sent him to know whether he might have leave to wait upon your Ladyship this Morning  Lady  Yes Tell him I expect him  Jeff  He durst not come because Mr  Lovemore  's with him  Lady  Go tell 'em if they please to come they shall be welcome both  Jeff  I shall Madam  Exit  Jeffrey  Pru  You see what Power your Beauty has Neither can live a Moment without seeing you  Lady  No they have other Business with me  Prudence  they came from  Paris  lately and brought me a Letter from my Brother and I believe they come for my Answer now  Pru  But does not one of 'em love you Madam  Lady  I have some Reason to believe he does Mr  Lovemore  has spar'd no Pains to persuade me to quit my Widowhood  Pru  I have been told Madam that Widowhood is a Gift Heaven seldom bestows but on its Favourites you are rich and know how troublesome Marriage is For my part I believe the fairest Hair the beautiful'st Curls do not become your Forehead so well as  Bando  did but every one Madam knows their own Necessities  Lady  I confess Widowhood has its Conveniencies but if Marriage be a Trouble to some 'tis a Pleasure to others  Prudence  Pru  You had the Experience of it thirty Years how did you like it Madam They say Sir  Oliver Laycock  lov'd your Ladyship  Lady  For all that he was jealous and what's worse was Old  Pru  Very well therefore you resolve to have a young One now Madam  Lady  You cannot blame me for that Can you  Prudence  Pru  Oh no 'tis well known Youth is comfortable But methinks you should take one a little nearer your own Age Madam A very young Man may be too treacherous for you Madam  Lady  Why is my Age so visible  Pru  No Madam with a little Help of Art you have some Remains of Beauty still You have something about your Eyes as pleasant now as others have at Twenty  Lady  'Tis a very malicious World we live in  Prudence  they are so apt to censure and speak of any single Woman that one ought to marry to avoid that Scandal  Pru  Some that are young are forc'd to marry to avoid Detraction others wou'd rather all that's Ill should be said of them than to have no Notice taken of 'em I knew a young Lady that pin'd to a Consumption because she liv'd three Years about the Court and never had the Honour to be lampoon'd The Truth is none that are Beautiful and Young can avoid Envy but few are so malicious to speak against the Old  Lady  There is no Age exempt from Scandal  Prudence  When we are Young they say we sell our selves when Old we are forc'd to hire to buy our Lovers  Pru  You know what they say Madam of the old Marchioness your Friend that was so admir'd so courted in her Youth who when she found she was forsook by all was forc'd to hire a Player by the Quarter How soon rhe poor Fellow was tir'd too How like a Sheepbiter he look'd after the first two Months  Lady  This  London  is a very wicked Place 'tis impossible to live without Scandal here  Pru  I'm afraid they'll say as much of you Madam if you bargain for a Husband To covet one that is both Young and Rich is too much in Conscience Madam  Lady  Thou know'st  Prudence  Wealth is not the thing I seek  Pru  Then Madam the Business is done the Viscount  SansTerre  shall be your Husband Madam  Lady  Ah  Prudence  if he were but as handsome as  Pru  Ah Madam that's too much  Lady  Why may not I wish for it  Pru  Consider his Quality Madam and 'bate him something for that One thing I must advise you be not too prodigal of your Gold at first to be liberal sometimes will be convenient and make him kinder to you  Lady  For all this I should think my self very happy if I were certain of Mr  Cuningham  or Mr  Lovemore  Pru  A little Jealousy will inflame 'em They'll be more pressing when the Viscount comes  Lady  But yet methinks  Cuningham  and my Neice  Pru  What Madam  Lady  Are always whispering  Pru  He only compliments her Madam She's too young to make Love seriously  Lady  With your Favour there's no trusting to that To my Knowledge there are those younger than she that understand what Love is but too well  Pru  That's true Madam but  Philadelphia  is so innocent that no Man can make Love to her but to divert himself Here she is Madam  Enter  Philadelphia  Lady  What does she come for I'll send her packing quickly  Pru  Consider what you do Madam How can Mr  Lovemore  entertain your Ladyship unless his Friend may divert himself the while with rallying with your Niece  Lady  For all that I could wish  Pru  Pray trouble not your self Trust me I'll watch her Madam  Phil  Will your Ladyship go to  Eaton  's The Coach is at the Door  Lady  No I'll not go yet  Phil  If you stay long Madam the best  Poynt  will be sold before you come  Lady  No matter Ha what ails the Girl How strangely she looks Her Eyes are hardly open yet  Phil  How Madam  Lady  Then her Head's dress'd awry How it disguises her Lord how frightfully it looks  Phil  Truly Aunt 'tis dress'd just as the Fashion is  Lady  Fetch her Hood  Prudence  I'll have her put it on till it be mended  Phil  I dress'd it to please no body but my self Madam  Lady  I'll have you dress your self now to please me Come put it on  Pru  My Lady's in the Right Never was any thing more ridiculous Here put on the Hood I am sure this is much handsomer  Lady  Why don't you put it on  Phil  I can't endure it Madam  Lady  Do I say  Pru  So Now it is as it should be all modest Maids should be dress'd so But here's Mr  Cuningham  and Mr  Lovemore  Enter  Cuningham Lovemore  and  Jeffry  Love  Your Servant Madam you see how we love your Company by giving you this Trouble in a Morning  Cun  'Tis a Happiness we are much envy'd for  Lady  You are welcome Gentlemen Pray command this House as freely as your own  Love  Why does this Lady hide her Face Pray Madam let us see you  Lady  Forbear Sir I beseech you She has had the ToothAch lately If she takes off her Hood she'll catch cold and bring the Pain again  Phil  I thank your Ladyship for your Care of me But the Pain has been gone so long I don't fear it now  Love  Nay then we must have it off  Phil  What say you Madam Shall I pull it off  Lady  Yes Impertinence I see you have a Mind to shew your self  Pru  'Tis the Nature of all young Girls to do what they are forbidden  Cun  I come not to trouble your Ladyship for your Letter to my Lawyer your countenancing my Business will be of great Advantage to me  Lady  This Sir is what my Brother commands me You shall see I take delight to serve his Friends  Love  Madam You promis'd me that Honourable Title  Lady  Do you pretend to it  Love  Yes Madam more than any one  Lady  I have not much Beauty to boast of but Virtue Sir makes some amends for the Defects of the other  Love  Defects  Cuningham  Courts  Philadelphia  Pray Madam wrong not your self so much  Lady  There are few but know a little their own Value And tho a Woman be not fam'd for a great Beauty yet if she be agreeable there are those will like her well enough  Love  You have that in Perfection Madam  Lady  In that Sir I know you do not flater  Phil    Phil  Madam  Cun  Then Madam you like my Choice of this Suit  Phil  Extremely well Was it your own Fancy Sir  Cun  I am not asham'd to own it since you ask it Madam  They counterfeit to be talking about Fashions whilst seemingly  Lovemore  Courts the Aunt  Pru  I'll listen to 'em  He talks to her of nothing but new Fashions  To the Widow  You may Madam venture to discourse without disturbance  Lady  Pray Sir tell me freely how old do you think I am  Love  Faith Madam if you were not a Widow I should think you a Girl scarce Twenty  Lady  Now Sir you flater me You might have said Thirty I do not love to disguise my Age  Love  How Thirty Madam and look so youthful I'll not believe it 'tis impossible  Lady  You do not know what Misery I endur'd whilst my old Husband liv'd The Griefs I had upon me would have distracted another Woman Alas Sir 'tis not Age but Sorrow has broke me  Love  It makes me sad to hear you tell it Madam and vexes me to think an old Man should enjoy such Happiness  Lady  You do not know how many Tears I have shed  Love  'Tis some Comfort Madam to remember he did not live long with you  Lady  Truly Sir Fifteen Years  Pru  Yes and Fifteen to that  Aside  Lady  Having been so unfortunate in a Husband you may believe I have but little Encouragement to venture Sir again For I am very happy now I am alone  Love  You do wisely Madam for she deserves not to be pity'd that rashly runs into the same Misfortune and therefore you have Madam  Lady  Nay Sir I have not forsworn Marrying yet  Love  Pray Madam where do you use to walk in the Evening Into St  James  's Park  Lady  Not very often Sir  Love  Or into the Mulberry Garden  Is not the Wilderness very pleasant  Lady  If I like my Company Sir I never mislike the Place  Love  Have you seen the new Paradise Madam 'Tis much superiour to the former  Lady  I have heard as much But Sir  Love  Let me have the Honour to wait upon you thither presently  Lady  Not yet Sir After Dinner if you please But tell me Sir do you think me such an Enemy to Marriage that were I sure a young Gentleman lov'd  me and lov'd me truly I would be so uncivil to refuse him  Love  When I consider what you endur'd in Sir  Oliver Laycock  's time I think you ought to do it Madam and that Man's unjust that urges you to break your Resolution  Lady  Pray do not mistake me Sir I have made no such Resolution yet  Love  Nay Madam since you are displeas'd at what I said we'll change the Discourse Pray Madam do you think the young Lord  Lucky  has that Interest at Court that Fame reports he has  Lady  Lord Sir this is a strange wild Answer to my Question Let me tell you Sir if I have any Merit Wealth or Beauty there's one in the World deserves 'em all  Pru  Good How she teazes him  Aside  Love  But has that one no Fault Madam  Lady  You know him very well Sir  Love  I know him Madam  Lady

kind thing to her and you win her Heart The Truth is she has not much Reputation but the Respect I give her is to her Quality and to her Person But she's an Original in her kind Sir  Love  Oh blind blind Creature she draws her own Picture and laughs at it  Cun  Sure Madam her Conversation must be very pleasant  Lady  She has been much courted in her Youth but 'twould make one die to hear her boast of her Lovers now How this Knight sighs and that Lord dies for her when all the while I know what Necessity the poor Creature is reduc'd to I would have brought her hither but I know we never

be so plagued as I have been I have parry'd with my best Skill the dangerous Thrusts that ever were made at me To tug at an Oar or dig in a Mine in  Peru  is Recreation to it But the first time to offer Marriage to me I sweat to think on it It made me tremble twice for fear she should have forc'd my Neck into her muddy Noose of Matrimony  Cun  We have no other way to blind her  Love  'Tis all one to me  Cun  If thou lov'st my Life Friend do not forsake me now  Love  Pray live if you please and give me leave to do so too Should I again be left alone with her the best I can hope for is

contrary Mr  Cuningham  What Business have you with her I wonder you are not asham'd to be always following of her at this rate and endeavouring to take Advantage of her foolish Youth for she is but a Girl yet and not fit for the Conversation of a Man nay or indeed to be trusted with her self  Cun  Madam  Lady  Go go indeed you are much to blame▪ What will the World judge think you Or what Excuse can I make for suffering such Doings in my House And you Huswife how dare you disobey my Commands Is this the Respect you pay to me and to my Quality I believe in a little time I must make it my whole Imploy to invite home young Gallants forsooth to pleasure you whilst I as if I were your Slave must retire and wait till you are serv'd first 'Tis come to a fine pass indeed but I'll put an End to it all and keep you always lock'd up in your Chamber I will so  Phil  I told you▪ Sir what would be the Event of your Projects but you would not be said nay I must be an Instrument to make your Passion known and none so fit to be trusted with such an Affair as I but henceforward if you can't speak for your self you may hang or drown as you pretend for me for I'll no more get Anger for you  Cun  What does she mean  Lady  What's that you say  Phil  Mr  Cuningham  here Madam is always urging me to tell your Ladyship the Passion he has for you  Lady  Saucy Slut  Phil  As if he could not speak for

disturb me just as I was going to tell him of my Intentions and of my Concern for his Passion  A side  Cun  I believe I am troublesome Madam  Is going  Farewel  Lady  No pray stay Sir I have something to say to you but that young Slut interrupted me  Cun  Oh the Devil  Lady  But as I was going to say I did indeed resolve not to marry any more and when you have heard me out you'll say I had Reason  You must know in my Husband Sir  Oliver  's Days I had not that Liberty perhaps as other Ladies of Quality took for to say Truth my airy Temper and my Youth at that time made my Husband grows jealous tho' without Cause Heaven knows  Cun  That I dare swear if all were of my Mind  Aside  Lady  Which made him lead me a very uneasy Life So that it made me resolve on many things at that time and one was this That if ever Sir  Oliver  should die I never would marry again but I don't remember that I swore to it Or if I had you have such a way with you 'twould be very hard to deny you any thing Mr

Success both to my King and my CountryAs have also the Chief Part of all our great Race even from  William the Conqueror  to this present Reign have our unquestion'd Glories stood a Pattern to our yet

any Crime against him that I know of unless sitting by my self all Day and poring over two or three good Books be an Offence Speak  Damaris  did I ever give him any Cause for these Suspicions and this Usage Thou know'st all I say or do  Damaris  Madam I know no Reason nor can I bear to see the Hardship you endure Like a barbarous Man as he isTo abuse so good a Lady so Virtuous so Innocent and so

put upon him in belying of him  Britt  How ask his Pardon that would have made me a Cuckold  Love  Sir  Peter  pray  Sir  Peter  I say no more Words He has wrong'd a Gentleman and the least he can do is begging Pardon  Britt  'Tis very well He offends and I must ask Pardon  Sir  Peter  No matter for that you hear he denies it and 'tis enough if a Gentleman unsays what he has said  Britt  So that if I catch him making me a Cuckold and he denies it I must not believe it because a Gentleman said it  Sir  Peter  I say you shall ask Pardon Therefore no more Words but do't  Britt  I shall run mad  Well what must I do  Sir  Peter  Come hither Take your Hat off Kneel down and say after me  Britt  Well since it must be so  Kneels  This 'tis to be marry'd to a Gentlewoman forsooth  Sir  Peter  Sir

all on Fire till I have her in my Arms  But soft who comes here  Enter  Prudence  Well my little Scout what News How fares my Friend Is  Philadelphia  kind Where's thy Lady  Pru  Where▪e'er her Person is I'm sure her best Thoughts are still employ'd on you And however she may pretend a Passion for Mr  Cuningham  she loves none but you Pray Sir do but try her  Love  Oh racking Thought I'd rather make Love to a Convocation of Cats at a Witch's Upsitting than but speak to her Where's my Friend Oh here he comes and his fair Consort  Enter  Cuningham  and  Philadelphia  Cun  Be not so cruel to say you want the Power If we neglect this Opportunity which kindly presents it self the next perhaps may not be ours  Phil  Would you then have me dispose of my self without my Aunt's Consent Do not urge me to that since I have promised not to wed without it  Cun  I ask not her Consent but yours Grant me but that and leave the rest to Time and Chance  Pru  Madam how can you deny him that since I know you love him  Cun  Ha Oh the charming Sound  And will you not consent to make me happy  Or do you not believe I love you  By all those Fires that burn within my Soul I swear  Pru  Hold Hold Sir You have sworn enough already to corrupt a whole Nunnery of Sighing Praying and Wishing young Votaries Why don't you give him your Hand since he has your Heart I believe you love to hear him swear andGive him your Hand or I'll discover all  Phil  Well there 'tis then  Gives her Hand to  Cuningham  But I promise nothing else I fear I have given too much already  Cun  Oh never never I'll pay thee back so vast a store of Love and Constancy as shall weary thee with still receiving  Pru  Madam Madam your Aunt's behind you  Enter  Widow  Phil  Ha My Aunt What shall I do  Cun  Fear nothing Madam but give me your Hand  I'll bring all off  Pretends to tell her Fortune▪  This Line seems to Point out some unexpected Cross And this Line thwarting the Line of Life signifies a retir'd Life and this joining with it shews you'll be in Danger of ending the latter part of your Days in a Nunnery  Widow behind them  Widow  How Mr  Cuningham  Can you tell Fortunes  Cun  I understand a little Palmistry Madam and can give a Ghess at Physiognomy  Widow  'Tis very well  When I enter'd first I thought you had been making  Love to my Neice I am glad to find it otherwise But where's the Viscount  Pru  In the next Room Madam  Love  I'll wait upon him I'd feign try whether his Inside be answerable to his outward Appearance  Is going  Cun  Nay prithee stay I can assure you he is not to be equall'd either in Person or Discourse  Pru  He is indeed a fine proper Man as one would wish to see  Widow  Why really his Lordship has Parts  Phil  You and  Prudence  go find him out and bear him Company awhile I'll wait on him immediately tell him You Sir may go with 'em if you please  To  Lovemore  Love  Madam most willingly  Cun  'Sdeath You won't leave me  Aside to  Lovemore  Love  Faith but I will dost think I'll stay to endure a second Hell For if there be one upon Earth 'tis being left alone with her  Madam Your Ladyship shall ever command me  To the Widow  Come Lady if you please the Honour of your fair Hand  To  Phil  Exit with  Phil  and  Pru  Cun  What will become of me now  Aside  Widow  Well Mr  Cuningham  I have long'd for some time to be alone with you that I might speak more freely to you  Cun  Madam 'tis too great an Honour  Widow  I wonder Sir you never think of Marrying  Cun  Madam as yet I dare not think on't  Widow  Oh dear Sir Pray why so  Cun  Because I have not well consider'd it and I have been told 'tis a dangerous Undertaking without having well thought beforehand  Widow  Pray Sir why should you think so  I'll vow 'tis an odd Thought Sir for one of your Understanding Why Sir I'll tell you  I have had Three Husbands and yet I have no great Reason to complain Tho' in my last Husband's time I had not altogether that real Satisfaction as I had with the other Two for to deal freely with you Sir my Husband Sir  Oliver Laycock  though he was a very wellbred Man yet he had his Humours sometimes and would be a little given to Jealousy so that I seldom led a quiet Hour when the Fit was upon him But in my first Husband's Days sure never Woman liv'd so happy I would not abeen unmarried to have had all the Riches of the Earth laid at my Feet But when I married with Sir  Oliver  and had once seen his Temper nothing I had in the World but what I would a given to a been free again and indeed in my Passion I often vow'd never if please Heav'n Sir  Oliver  died to marry any more  Cun  'Twas rashly done  But no doubt were there that Man fitting to merit your Favour and equally deserving your Person and your Estate and one whom your Ladyship could like you might perhaps be persuaded to break your Vow and venture once again  Widow  I'll swear I hardly think it and yet one don't know how one may be tempted tho' if I were to be persuaded and I will not forswear any thing I know not any one that can so soon persuade me to it as you Mr  Cuningham  Cun  Death and the Devil What have I brought upon my self  Aside  Oh Madam You make me blush  But Madam How cou'd you with Honour put off the Viscount who you know loves you and is come on purpose to marry you  Wid  Why I intend him for my Niece you must know who no doubt will be much better pleas'd with the Change For to say Truth Mr  Cuningham  I have always had more than a common Esteem for you and for your Behaviour and have long since resolv'd that if I do alter my Condition you are the Man alone I have plac'd my Thoughts upon  Cun  You make me blush Madam  Wou'd I were a League underground or in any Hell but this  Aside  You cannot sure  To her  Wid  I vow 'tis true and yet  Cun  Hear me but speak Madam  Wid  'Tis odd that Love shou'd overpower People at so strange a rate  Cun  But I should be unjust to my Friend who I know loves you dearer than his Life  Wid  Oh dear Who's that I beseech you Sir  Cun  Mr  Lovemore  Madam  Widow  Mr  Lovemore  I'll swear I don't believe it  Cun  Oh Madam 'tis but too true as will appear I'm afraid when he knows you place your Affections on any other Man  Widow  I'll vow you much surprize me Mr  Cuningham  but how came you to know it  Cun  Oft has he begg'd me to bear him Company in some lonely Place where he wou'd sigh and tell such
