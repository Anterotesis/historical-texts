THOMPSON  ON the pleasant banks of the Garonne in the province of Gascony stood in the year the chateau of Monsieur St Aubert From its windows were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along the river gay with luxuriant woods and vines and plantations of olives To the south the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenées whose summits veiled in clouds or  exhibiting awful forms seen and lost again as the partial vapours rolled along were sometimes barren and gleamed through the blue tinge of air and sometimes frowned with forests of gloomy pine that swept downward to their base These tremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures and woods that hung upon their skirts among whose flocks and herds and simple cottages the eye after having scaled the cliffs above delighted to repose To the north and to the east the plains of Guienne and Languedoc were lost in the mist of distance on the west Gascony was bounded by the waters of Biscay  M St Aubert loved to wander with his wife and daughter on the margin of the Garonne and to listen to the music that floated on its waves He had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity having mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world but  the flattering portrait of mankind which his heart had delineated in early youth his experience had too sorrowfully corrected Yet amidst the changing visions of life his principles remained unshaken his benevolence unchilled and he retired from the multitude "more in  pity  than in anger" to scenes of simple nature to the pure delights of literature and to the exercise of domestic virtues  He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family and it was designed that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth should be supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage or by success in the intrigues of public affairs But St Aubert had too nice a sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope and too small a portion of ambition to sacrifice what he called happiness to the attainment of wealth After the death of his father he married a very amiable woman his equal in birth and not his superior in fortune The late Monsieur  St Aubert's liberality or extravagance had so much involved his affairs that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain and some years after his marriage he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel the brother of his wife and retired to a small estate in Gascony where conjugal felicity and parental duties divided his attention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of genius  To this spot he had been attached from his infancy He had often made excursions to it when a boy and the impressions of delight given to his mind by the homely kindness of the greyheaded peasant to whom it was intrusted and whose fruit and cream never failed had not been obliterated by succeeding circumstances The green pastures along which he had so often bounded in the exultation of health and youthful freedomthe woods under whose refreshing shade he had first indulged that pensive  melancholy which afterwards made a strong feature of his characterthe wild walks of the mountains the river on whose wavés he had floated and the distant plains which seemed boundless as his early hopeswere never after remembered by St Aubert but with enthusiasm and regret At length he disengaged himself from the world and retired hither to realize the wishes of many years  The building as it then stood was merely a summer cottage rendered interesting to a stranger by its neat simplicity or the beauty of the surrounding scene and considerable additions were necessary to make it a comfortable family residence St Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric which he remembered in his youth and would not suffer a stone of it to be removed so that the new building adapted to the style of the old one formed with it only a simple and elegant residence  The taste of Madame St Aubert was conspicuous in its internal finishing where the same chaste simplicity was observable in the furniture and in the few ornaments of the apartments that characterised the manners of its inhabitants  The library occupied the west side of the chateau and was enriched by a collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages This room opened upon a grove which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity that fell towards the river and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and pleasing shade while from the windows the eye caught beneath the spreading branches the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the west and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenées Adjoining the library was a greenhouse stored with scarce and beautiful plants for one of the amusements of St Aubert was the study of botany and among the neighbouring  mountains which afforded a luxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist he often passed the day in the pursuits of his favourite science He was sometimes accompanied in these little excursions by Madame St Aubert and frequently by his daughter when with a small osier basket to receive plants and another filled with cold refreshments such as the cabin of the shepherd did not afford they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent scenes nor suffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to abstract them from the observance of her stupendous works When weary of sauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps of the enthusiast and where no track appeared on the vegetation but what the foot of the izard had left they would seek one of those green recesses which so beautisully adorn the bosom of these mountains where under the shade of the lofty larch or cedar they enjoyed  their simple repast made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream that crept along the turf and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants that fringed the rocks and inlaid the grass  Adjoining the eastern side of the greenhouse looking towards the plains of Languedoc was a room which Emily called hers and which contained her books her drawings her musical instruments with some favourite birds and plants Here she usually exercised herself in elegant arts cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste and in which native genius assisted by the instructions of Monsieur and Madame St Aubert made her an early prosicient The windows of this room were particularly pleasant they descended to the floor and opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house the eye was led between groves of almond palmtrees floweringash and myrtle to the distant landscape where the Garonne wandered  The peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening when the day's labour was done dancing in groups on the margin of the river Their sprightly melodies  debonnaire  steps the fanciful figure of their dances with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls adjusted their simple dress gave a character to the scene entirely French  The front of the chateau which having a southern aspect opened upon the grandeur of the mountains was occupied on the ground floor by a rustic hall and two excellent sitting rooms The first floor for the cottage had no second story was laid out in bedchambers except one apartment that opened to a balcony and which was generally used for a breakfastroom  In the surrounding ground St Aubert had made very tasteful improvements yet such was his attachment to objects he had remembered from his boyish days that he had in some instances sacrificed taste to sentiment There were  two old larches that shaded the building and interrupted the prospect St Aubert had sometimes declared that he believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall In addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech pine and mountainash On a lofty terrace formed by the swelling bank of the river rose a plantation of orange lemon and palmtrees whose fruit in the coolness of evening breathed delicious fragrance With these were mingled a few trees of other species Here under the ample shade of a planetree that spread its majestic canopy towards the river St Aubert loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer with his wife and children watching beneath its foliage the settingsun the mild splendour of its light fading from the distant landscape till the shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of sober gray Here too he loved to read and to converse with Madame St Aubert or to play  with his children resigning himself to the influence of those sweet affections which are ever attendant on simplicity and nature He has often said while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world His heart was occupied it had what can be so rarely said no wish for a happiness beyond what it experienced The consciousness of acting right diffused a serenity over his manners which nothing else could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his and which refined his sense of every surrounding blessing  The deepest shade of twilight did not send him from his favourite planetree He loved the soothing hour when the last tints of light die away when the stars one by one tremble through aether and are reflected on the dark mirror of the waters that hour which of all others inspires the mind with pensive tenderness  and often elevates it to sublime contemplation When the moon shed her soft rays among the foliage he still lingered and his pastoral supper of cream and fruits was often spread beneath it Then on the stillness of night came the song of the nightingale breathing sweetness and awakening melancholy  The first interruptions to the happiness he had known since his retirement were occasioned by the death of his two sons He lost them at that age when infantine simplicity is so fascinating and though in consideration of Madame St Aubert's distress he restrained the expression of his own and endeavoured to bear it as he meant with philosophy he had in truth no philosophy that could render him calm to such losses One daughter was now his only surviving child and while he watched the unfolding of her infant character with anxious fondness he endeavoured with unremitting effort to counteract those traits in her disposition which might  hereafter lead her from happiness She had discovered in her early years uncommon delicacy of mind warm affections and ready benevolence but with these was observable a degree of susceptibility too exquisite to admit of lasting peace As she advanced in youth this sensibility gave a pensive tone to her spirits and a softness to her manner which added grace to beauty and rendered her a very interesting object to persons of a congenial disposition But St Aubert had too much good sense to prefer a charm to a virtue and had penetration enough to see that this charm was too dangerous to its possessor to be allowed the character of a blessing He endeavoured therefore to strengthen her mind to enure her to habits of selfcommand to teach her to reject the first impulse of her feelings and to look with cool examination upon the disappointments he sometimes threw in her way While he instructed her to resist  first impressions and to acquire that steady dignity of mind that can alone counterbalance the passions and bear us as far as is compatible with our nature above the reach of circumstances he taught himself a lesson of fortitude for he was often obliged to witness with seeming indifference the tears and struggles which his caution occasioned her  In person Emily resembled her mother having the same elegant symmetry of form the same delicacy of features and the same blue eyes full of tender sweetness But lovely as was her person it was the varied expression of her countenance as conversation awakened the nicer emotions of her mind that threw such a captivating grace around her  Those tend'rer tints that shun the careless eye  And in the world's contagious circle die  St Aubert cultivated her understanding with the most scrupulous care He  gave her a general view of the sciences and an exact acquaintance with every part of elegant literature He taught her Latin and English chiefly that she might understand the sublimity of their best poets She discovered in her early years a taste for works of genius and it was St Aubert's principle as well as his inclination to promote every innocent means of happiness "A wellinformed mind" he would say "is the best security against the contagion of folly and of vice The vacant mind is ever on the watch for relief and ready to plunge into error to escape from the languor of idleness Store it with ideas teach it the pleasure of thinking and the temptations of the world without will be counteracted by the gratifications derived from the world within Thought and cultivation are necessary equally to the happiness of a country and a city life in the first they prevent the uneasy sensations of indolence and afford a sublime  pleasure in the taste they create for the beautiful and the grand in the latter they make dissipation less an object of necessity and consequently of interest  It was one of Emily's earliest pleasures to ramble among the scenes of nature nor was it in the soft and glowing landscape that she most delighted she loved more the wild woodwalks that skirted the mountain and still more the mountain's stupendous recesses where the silence and grandeur of solitude impressed a sacred awe upon her heart and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH In scenes like these she would often linger alone wrapt in a melancholy charm till the last gleam of day faded from the west till the lonely sound of a sheepbell or the distant bark of a watchdog were all that broke on the stillness of the evening Then the gloom of the woods the trembling of their leaves at intervals in the breeze the bat flitting on the twilight the cottagelights  now seen and now lostwere circumstances that awakened her mind into effort and led to enthusiasm and poetry  Her favourite walk was to a little fishinghouse belonging to St Aubert in a woody glen on the margin of a rivulet that descended from the Pyrenées and after foaming among their rocks wound its silent way beneath the shades it reflected Above the woods that screened this glen rose the lofty summits of the Pyrenées which often burst boldly on the eye through the glades below Sometimes the shattered face of a rock only was seen crowned with wild shrubs or a shepherd's cabin seated on a cliff overshadowed by dark cypress or waving ash Emerging from the deep recesses of the woods the glade opened to the distant landscape where the rich pastures and vine covered slopes of Gascony gradually declined to the plains and there on the winding shores of the Garonne groves and hamlets and villastheir outlines  softened by distance melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint  This too was the favourite retreat of St Aubert to which he frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon with his wife his daughter and his books or came at the sweet evening hour to welcome the silent dusk or to listen for the music of the nightingale Sometimes too he brought music of his own and awakened every fairy echo with the tender accents of his oboe and often have the tones of Emily's voice drawn sweetness from the waves over which they trembled  It was in one of her excursions to this spot that she observed the following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wainscot  SONNET  Go pencil faithful to thy master's sighs  Gotell the Goddess of this fairy scene  When next her light steps wind these woodwalks green  Whence all his tears his tender sorrows rise  Ah paint her form her soulillumin'd eyes  The sweet expression of her pensive face  The light'ning smile the animated grace  The portrait well the lover's voice supplies  Speaks all his heart must feel his tongue would say  Yet ah not all his heart must sadly feel  How oft the flow'ret's silken leaves conceal  The drag that steals the vital spark away  And who that gazes on that angelsmile  Would fear its charm or think it could beguile  These lines were not inscribed to any person Emily therefore could not apply them to herself though she was undoubtedly the nymph of these shades Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance without being detained by a suspicion as to whom they could be addressed she was compelled to rest in uncertainty an uncertainty which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers She had no leisure to suffer this circumstance trifling at first to swell into importance by frequent remembrance  The little vanity it had excited for the incertitude which forbade her to presume upon having inspired the sonnet forbade her also to disbelieve it passed away and the incident was dismissed from her thoughts amid her books her studies and the exercise of social charities  Soon after this period her anxiety was awakened by the indisposition of her father who was attacked with a fever which though not thought to be of a dangerous kind gave a severe shock to his constitution Madame St Aubert and Emily attended him with unremitting care but his recovery was very slow and as he advanced towards health Madame seemed to decline  The first scene he visited after he was well enough to take the air was his favourite fishinghouse A basket of provisions was sent thither with books and Emily's lute for fishingtackle he had to use for he never could find amusement in torturing or destroying  After employing himself for about an hour in botanizing dinner was served It was a repast to which gratitude for being again permitted to visit this spot gave sweetness and family happiness once more smiled beneath these shades Monsieur St Aubert conversed with unusual cheerfulness every object delighted his senses The refreshing pleasure from the first view of nature after the pain of illness and the confinement of a sickchamber is above the conceptions as well as the descriptions of those in health The green woods and pastures the flowery turf the blue concave of the heavens the balmy air the murmur of the limpid stream and even the hum of every little insect of the shade seem to revivify the soul and make mere existence bliss  Madame St Aubert reanimated by the cheerfulness and recovery of her husband was no longer sensible of the indisposition which had lately oppressed her and as she sauntered along the  wood walks of this romantic glen and conversed with him and with her daughter she often looked at them alternately with a degree of tenderness that filled her eyes with tears St Aubert observed this more than once and gently reproved her for the emotion but she could only smile clasp his hand and that of Emily and weep the more He felt the tender enthusiasm stealing upon himself in a degree that became almost painful his features assumed a serious air and he could not forbear secretly sighing"Perhaps I shall some time look back to these moments as to the summit of my happiness with hopeless regret But let me not misuse them by useless anticipation let me hope I shall not live to mourn the loss of those who are dearer to me than life"  To relieve or perhaps to indulge the pensive temper of his mind hebade Emily fetch the lute she knew how to touch with such sweet pathos As she drew near the  fishinghouse she was surprised to hear the tones of the instrument which were awakened by the hand of taste and uttered a plaintive air whose exquisite melody engaged all her attention She listened in profound silence afraid to move from the spot lest the sound of her steps should occasion her to lose a note of the music or should disturb the musician Every thing without the building was still and no person appeared She continued to listen till timidity succeeded to surprise and delight a timidity increased by a remembrance of the pencilled lines she had formerly seen and she hesitated whether to proceed or to return  While she paused the music ceased and after a momentary hesitation she recollected courage to advance to the fishinghouse which she entered with faltering steps and found unoccupied Her lute lay on the table every thing seemed undisturbed and she began to believe it was another instrument she had heard till she  remembered that when she followed M and Madame St Aubert from this spot her lute was left on a window seat She felt alarmed yet knew not wherefore the melancholy gloom of evening and the profound stillness of the place interrupted only by the light trembling of leaves heightened her fanciful apprehensions and she was desirous of quitting the building but perceived herself grow faint and sat down As she tried to recover herself the pencilled lines on the wainscot met her eye she started as if she had seen a stranger but endeavouring to conquer the tremour of her spirits rose and went to the window To the lines before noticed she now perceived that others were added in which her name appeared  Though no longer suffered to doubt that they were addressed to herself she was as ignorant as before by whom they could be written While she mused she thought she heard the found of a  step without the building and again alarmed she caught up her lute and hurried away Monsieur and Madame St Aubert she found in a little path that wound along the sides of the glen  Having reached a green summit shadowed by palmtrees and overlooking the vallies and plains of Gascony they seated themselves on the turf and while their eyes wandered over the glorious scene and they inhaled the sweet breath of flowers and herbs that enriched the grass Emily played and sung several of their favourite airs with the delicacy of expression in which she so much excelled  Music and conversation detained them in this enchanting spot till the sun's last light stept upon the plains till the white sails that glided beneath the mountains where the Garonne wandered became dim and the gloom of evening stole over the landscape It was a melancholy but not unpleasing gloom St Aubert and his family rose and left the place with  regret alas Madame St Aubert knew not that she left it for ever  When they reached the fishinghouse she missed her bracelet and recollected that she had taken it from her arm after dinner and had left it on the table when she went to walk After a long search in which Emily was very active she was compelled to resign herself to the loss of it What made this bracelet valuable to her was a miniature of her daughter to which it was attached esteemed a striking resemblance and which had been painted only a few months before When Emily was convinced that the bracelet was really gone she blushed and became thoughtful That some stranger had been in the fishinghouse during her absence her lute and the additional lines of a pencil had already informed her from the purport of these lines it was not unreasonable to believe that the poet the musician and the thief were the same person But though the music she had heard  the written lines she had seen and the disappearance of the picture formed a combination of circumstances very remarkable she was irresistibly restrained from mentioning them secretly determining however never again to visit the fishinghouse without Monsieur or Madame St Aubert  They returned pensively to the chateau Emily musing on the incident which had just occurred St Aubert reflecting with placid gratitude on the blessings he possessed and Madame St Aubert somewhat disturbed and perplexed by the loss of her daughter's picture As they drew near the house they observed an unusual bustle about it the sound of voices was distinctly heard servants and horses were seen passing between the trees and at length the wheels of a carriage rolled along Having come within view of the front of the chateau a landau with smoking horses appeared on the little lawn before it St Aubert perceived the liveries of his brotherinlaw and in the  parlour he found Monsieur and Madame Quesnel already entered They had left Paris some days before and were on the way to their estate only ten leagues distant from La Vallée and which Monsieur Quesnel had purchased several years before of St Aubert This gentleman was the only brother of Madame St Aubert but the ties of relationship having never been strengthened by congeniality of character the intercourse between them had not been frequent M Quesnel had lived altogether in the world his aim had been consequence splendour was the object of his taste and his address and knowledge of character had carried him forward to the attainment of almost all that he had courted By a man of such a disposition it is not surprising that the virtues of St Aubert should be overlooked or that his pure taste simplicity and moderated wishes were considered as marks of a weak intellect and of confined views The marriage of his sister  with St Aubert had been mortifying to his ambition for he had designed that the matrimonial connection she formed should assist him to attain the consequence which he so much desired and some offers were made her by persons whose rank and fortune flattered his warmest hope But his sister who was then addressed also by St Aubert perceived or thought she perceived that happiness and splendour were not the same and she did not hesitate to forego the last for the attainment of the former Whether Monsieur Quesnel thought them the same or not he would readily have sacrificed his sister's peace to the gratification of his own ambition and on her marriage with St Aubert expressed in private his contempt of her spiritless conduct and of the connection which it permitted Madame St Aubert though she concealed this insult from her husband felt perhaps for the first time resentment lighted in her heart and though a regard  for her own dignity united with considerations of prudence restrained her expression of this resentment there was ever after a mild reserve in her manner towards M Quesnel which he both understood and felt  In his own marriage he did not follow his sister's example His lady was an Italian and an heiress by birth and by nature and education was a vain and frivolous woman  They now determined to pass the night with St Aubert and as the chateau was not large enough to accommodate their servants the latter were dismissed to the neighbouring village When the first compliments were over and the arrangements for the night made M Quesnel began the display of his intelligence and his connections while St Aubert who had been long enough in retirement to find these topics recommended by their novelty listened with a degree of patience and attention which  his guest mistook for the humility of wonder The latter indeed described the few festivities which the turbulence of that period permitted to the court of Henry the Third with a minuteness that somewhat recompensed for his ostentation but when he came to speak of the character of the Duke de Joyeuse of a secret treaty which he knew to be negociating with the Porte and of the light in which Henry of Navarre was received M St Aubert recollected enough of his former experience to be assured that his guest could be only of an inferior class of politicians and that from the importance of the subjects upon which he committed himself he could not be of the rank to which he pretended to belong The opinions delivered by M Quesnel were such as St Aubert forbore to reply to for he knew that his guest had neither humanity to feel nor discernment to perceive what is just  Madame Quesnel meanwhile was expressing  to Madame St Aubert her astonishment that she could bear to pass her life in this remote corner of the world as she called it and describing from a wish probably of exciting envy the splendour of the balls banquets and processions which had just been given by the court in honour of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuse with Margaretta of Lorrain the sister of the Queen She described with equal minuteness the magnificence she had seen and that from which she had been excluded while Emily's vivid fancy as she listened with the ardent curiosity of youth heightened the scenes she heard of and Madame St Aubert looking on her family felt as a tear stole to her eye that though splendour may grace happiness virtue only can bestow it  "It is now twelve years St Aubert" said M Quesnel "since I purchased your family estate""Somewhere thereabout" replied St Aubert suppressing a sigh "It is near five years since I have been there"  resumed Quesnel "for Paris and its neighbourhood is the only place in the world to live in and I am so immersed in politics and have so many affairs of moment on my hands that I find it difficult to steal away even for a month or two" St Aubert remaining silent M Quesnel proceeded "I have sometimes wondered how you who have lived in the capital and have been accustomed to company can exist elsewhereespecially in so remote a country as this where you can neither hear nor fee any thing and can in short be scarcely conscious of life"  "I live for my family and myself" said St Aubert "I am now contented to know only happinessformerly I knew life"  "I mean to expend thirty or forty thousand livres on improvements" said M Quesnel without seeming to notice the words of St Aubert "for I design next summer to bring here my friends the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis Ramont to pass a month or two with  me" To St Aubert's enquiry as to these intended improvements he replied that he should take down the old east wing of the chateau and raise upon the site a set of stables "Then I shall build" said he "  a salle à manger  a  salon  a  salle au commune  and a number of rooms for servants for at present there is not accommodation for a third part of my own people"  "It accommodated our father's household" said St Aubert grieved that the old mansion was to be thus improved "and that was not a small one"  "Our notions are somewhat enlarged since those days" said M Quesnel"what was then thought a decent style of living would not now be endured" Even the calm St Aubert blushed at these words but his anger soon yielded to contempt "The ground about the chateau is encumbered with trees I mean to cut some of them down"  "Cut down the trees too" said St Aubert  "Certainly Why should I not they interrupt my prospects There is a cheshut which spreads its branches before the whole south side of the chateau and which is so ancient that they tell me the hollow of its trunk will hold a dozen men Your enthusiasm will scarcely contend that there can be either use or beauty in such a sapless old tree as this"  "Good God" exclaimed St Aubert "you surely will not destroy that noble chesnut which has flourished for centuries the glory of the estate It was in its maturity when the present mansion was built How often in my youth I have climbed among its broad branches and sat embowered amidst a world of leaves while the heavy shower has pattered above and not a rain drop reached me How often I have sat with a book in my hand sometimes reading and sometimes looking  out between the branches upon the wide landscape and the setting sun till twilight came and brought the birds home to their little nests among the leaves How oftenbut pardon me" added St Aubert recollecting that he was speaking to a man who could neither comprehend nor allow for his feelings "I am talking of times and feelings as oldfashioned as the taste that would spare that venerable tree"  "It will certainly come down" said M Quesnel "I believe I shall plant some Lombardy poplars among the clumps of chesnut that I shall leave of the avenue Madame Quesnel is partial to the poplar and tells me how much it adorns a villa of her uncle not far from Venice"  "On the banks of the Brenta indeed" continued St Aubert "where its spiry form is intermingled with the pine and the cypress and where it plays over light and elegant porticos and colonnades it unquestionably adorns the scene but  among the giants of the forest and near a heavy gothic mansion"  "Well my good sir" said M Quesnel "I will not dispute with you You must return to Paris before our ideas can▪ at all agree But  àpropos  of Venice I have some thoughts of going thither next summer events may call me to take possession of that same villa too which they tell me is the most charming that can be imagined In that case I shall leave the improvements▪ I mention to another year and I may perhaps be tempted to stay some time in Italy"  Emily was somewhat surprised to hear him talk of being tempted to remain abroad after he had mentioned his presence to be so necessary at Paris that it was with difficulty he could steal away for a month or two but St Aubert understood the selfimportance of the man too well to wonder at this trait and the possibility that these projected improvements might be deferred gave him  a hope that they might never take place  Before they separated for the night M Quesnel desired to speak with St Aubert alone and they retired to another room where they remained a considerable time The subject of this conversation was not known but whatever it might be St Aubert when he returned to the supperroom seemed much disturbed and a shade of sorrow sometimes fell upon his features that alarmed Madame St Aubert When they were alone she was tempted to enquire the occasion of it but the delicacy of mind which had ever appeared in his conduct restrained her she considered that if St Aubert wished her to be acquainted with the subject of his concern he would not wait for her enquiries  On the following day before M Quesnel departed he had a second conference with St Aubert  The guests after dining at she chateau set out in the cool of the day for Epourville  whither they gave him and Madame St Aubert a pressing invitation prompted rather by the vanity of displaying their splendour than by a wish to make their friends happy  Emily returned with delight to the liberty which their presence had restrained to her books her walks and the rational conversation of M and Madame St Aubert who seemed to rejoice no less that they were delivered from the shackles which arrogance and frivolity had imposed  Madame St Aubert excused herself from sharing their usual evening walk complaining that she was not quite well and St Aubert and Emily went out together  They chose a walk towards the mountains intending to visit some old pensioners of St Aubert which from his very moderate income he contrived to support though it is probable M Quesnel with  his very large one could not have afforded this  After distributing to his pensioners their weekly stipends listening patiently to the complaints of some redressing the grievances of others and softening the discontents of all by the look of sympathy and the smile of benevolence St Aubert returned home through the woods  where  At fall of eve the fairypeople throng  In various games and revelry to pass  The summer night as village stories tell  THOMPSON  "The evening gloom of woods was always delightful to me" said St Aubert whose mind now experienced the sweet calm which results from the consciousness of having done a beneficent action and which disposes it to receive pleasure from every surrounding object "I remember that in my youth this gloom used to call forth to my fancy a thousand fairy visions and romantic images and I own I am not yet wholly insensible of that high enthusiasm  which wakes the poet's dream I can linger with solemn steps under the deep shades send forward a transforming eye into the distant obscurity and listen with thrilling delight to the mystic murmuring of the woods"  "O my dear father" said Emily while a sudden tear started to her eye "how exactly you describe what I have felt so often and which I thought nobody had ever felt but myself But hark here comes the sweeping sound over the woodtopsnow it dies awayhow solemn the stillness that succeeds Now the breeze swells again It is like the voice of some supernatural beingthe voice of the spirit of the woods that watches over them by night Ah what light is yonder But it is gone And now it gleams again near the root of that large chesnut look sir"  "Are you such an admirer of nature" said St Aubert "and so little acquainted with her appearances as not to know that  for the glowworm But come" added he gaily "step a little further and we shall see fairies perhaps they are often companions The glowworm lends his light and they in return charm him with music and the dance Do you see nothing tripping yonder"  Emily laughed "Well my dear sir" said she "since you allow of this alliance I may venture to own I have anticipated you and almost dare venture to repeat some verses I made one evening in these very woods"  "Nay" replied St Aubert "dismiss the  almost  and venture quite let us hear what vagaries fancy has been playing in your mind If fhe has given you one of her spells you need not envy those of the fairies"  "If it is strong enough to enchant your judgment sir" said Emily "while I disclose her images I need  not  envy them The lines go in a sort of tripping measure which I thought might suit  the subject well enough but I fear they are too irregular  THE GLOWWORM  How pleasant is the greenwood's deepmatted shade  On a midsummer's eve when the fresh rain is o'er  When the yellow beams slope and sparkle thro' the glade  And swiftly in the thin air the light swallows soar  But sweeter sweeter still when the sun sinks to rest  And twilight comes on with the fairies so gay  Tripping through the foreftwalk where flow'rs unprest  Bow not their tall heads beneath their frolic play  To music's softest sounds they dance away the hour  Till moonlight steals down among the trembling leaves  And checquers all the ground and guides them to the bow'r  The long haunted bow'r where the nightingale grieves  Then no more they dance till her sad song is done  But silent as the night to her mourning attend  And often as her dying notes their pity have won  They vow all her sacred haunts from mortals to defends  When down among the mountains sinks the ev'ning star  And the changing moon forsakes this shadowy sphere  How cheerless would they be tho' they fairies are  If I with my pale light came not near  Yet cheerless tho' they'd be they're ungrateful to my love  For often when the traveller's benighted on his way  And I glimmer in his path and would guide him thro' the grove  They bind me in their magic spells to lead him far astray  And in the mire to leave him till the all stars are all burnt out  While in strangelooking shapes they frisk about the ground  And afar in the woods they raise a dismal shout  Till I shrink into my cell again for terror of the sound  But see where all the tiny elves come dancing in a ring  With the merry merry pipe and the tabor and the horn  And the timbrel so clear and the lute with dulcet string  Then round about the oak they go till peeping of the morn  Down yonder glade two lovers steal to shun the fairyqueen  Who frowns upon their plighted vows and jealous is of me  That yestereve I lighted them along the dewy green  To seek the purple flow'r whose juice from all her spells can free  And now to punish me she keeps afar her jocund band  With the merry merry pipe and the tabor and the lute  If I creep near yonder oak she will wave her fairy wand  And to me the dance will cease and the music all be mute  O had I but that purple slow'r whose leaves her charms can foil  And knew like says to draw the juice and throw it on the wind  I'd be her slave no longer' nor the traveller beguile  And help all faithful lovers nor fear the fairy kind  But soon the  vapour of the woods  will wander afar  And the fickle moon will fade and the stars disappear  Then cheerless will they be tho' they fairies are  If I with my pale light come not near  Whatever St Aubert might think of the stanzas he would not deny his daughter the pleasure of believing that he approved them and having given his commendation he sunk into a reverie and they walked on in silence  A faint erroneous ray  Glanc'd from th' imperfect surfaces of things  Flung half an image on the straining eye  While waving woods and villages and streams  And rocks and mountaintops that long retain  The ascending gleam are all one swimming soene  Uncertain if beheld  THOMPSON  St Aubert continued silent till he reached the chateau where his wife had retired to her chamber The languor and dejection that had lately oppressed her and which the exertion called forth by the arrival of her guests had suspended now returned with increased effect On the following day symptoms of fever appeared and St Aubert having sent for medical advice learned that her disorder was a  fever of the same nature as that from which he had lately recovered She had indeed taken the infection during her attendance upon him and her constitution being too weak to throw out the disease immediately it had lurked in her veins and occasioned the heavy languor of which she had complained St Aubert whose anxiety for his wife overcame every other consideration detained the physician in his house He remembered the feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his mind on the day when he had last visited the fishinghouse in company with Madame St Aubert and he now admitted a presentiment that this illness would be a fatal one But he effectually concealed this from her and from his daughter whom he endeavoured to reanimate wit hopes that her constant assiduities woul not be unavailing The physician whe  asked by St Aubert for his opinion  the disorder replied that the event of  depended upon circumstances which he could not ascertain Madame St Aubert seemed to have formed a more decided one but her eyes only gave hints of this She frequently fixed them upon her anxious friends with an expression of pity and of tenderness as if she anticipated the sorrow that awaited them and that seemed to say it was for their sakes only for their sufferings that she regretted life On the seventh day the disorder was at its crisis The physician assumed a graver manner which she observed and took occasion when her family had once quitted the chamber to tell him that she perceived her death was approaching "Do not attempt to deceive me" said she "I feel that I cannot long survive I am prepared for the event I have long I hope been preparing for it Since I have not long to live do not suffer a mistaken compassion to induce you to flatter my family with false hopes If you do their  affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives I will endeavour to teach them resignation by my example"  The physician was affected he promised to obey her and told St Aubert somewhat abruptly that there was nothing to expect The latter was not philosopher enough to restrain his feelings when he received this information but a consideration of the increased affliction which the observance of his grief would occasion his wife enabled him after some time to command himself in her presence Emily was at first overwhelmed with the intelligence then deluded by the strength of her wishes a hope sprung up in her mind that her mother would yet recover and to this she pertinaciously adhered almost to the last hour  The progress of this disorder was marked on the side of Madame St Aubert by patient suffering and subjected wishes The composure with which she awaited her death could be derived only from the retrospect of a life governed as far as human  frailty permits by a consciousness of being always in the presence of the Deity and by the hope of an higher world But her piety could not entirely subdue the grief of parting from those whom she so dearly loved During these her last hours she conversed much with St Aubert and Emily on the prospect of futurity and on other religious topics The resignation she expressed with the firm hope of meeting in a future world the friends she left in this and the effort which sometimes appeared to conceal her sorrow at this temporary separation frequently affected St Aubert so much as to oblige him to leave the room Having indulged his tears awhile he would dry them and return to the chamber with a countenance composed by an endeavour which did but increase his grief  Never had Emily felt the importance of the lessons which had taught her to restrain her sensibility so much as in these moments and never had she practised them with a triumph so complete But when the last  was over she sunk at once under the pressure of her sorrow and then perceived that it was hope as well as fortitude which had hitherto supported her St Aubert was for a time too devoid of comfort himself to bestow any on his daughter  CHAP II  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word  Would harrow up thy soul  SHAKESPEARE  MADAME St Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church her husband and daughter attended her to the grave followed by a long train of the peasantry who were sincere mourners of this excellent woman  On his return from the funeral St Aubert shut himself in his chamber When he came forth it was with a serene countenance though pale in sorrow He gave orders that his family should attend him Emily only was absent who overcome with the scene she had just witnessed had retired to her closet to weep alone St Aubert followed her thither he took her hand in silence while she continued to weep and it was some moments before he could so far command his voice as to speak It trembled while he said "My  Emily I am going to prayers with my family you will join us We must ask support from above Where else ought we to seek itwhere else can we find it"  Emily checked her tears and followed her father to the parlour where the servants being assembled St Aubert read in a low and solemn voice the evening service and added a prayer for the soul of the departed During this his voice often faltered his tears fell upon the book and at length he paused But the sublime emotions of pure devotion gradually elevated his views above this world and finally brought comfort to his heart  When the service was ended and the servants were withdrawn he tenderly kissed Emily and said "I have endeavoured to teach you from your earliest youth the duty of selfcommand I have pointed out to you the great importance of it through life not only as it preserves us in the various and dangerous temptations that call us from rectitude and virtue but as it limits the  indulgences which are termed virtuous yet which extended beyond a certain boundary are vicious for their consequence is evil All excess is vicious even that sorrow which is amiable in its origin becomes a selfish and unjust passion if indulged at the expence of our dutiesby our duties I mean what we owe to ourselves as well as to others The indulgence of excessive grief enervates the mind and almost incapacitates it for again partaking of those various innocent enjoyments which a benevolent God designed to be the sunshine of our lives My dear Emily recollect and practise the precepts I have so often given you and which your own experience has so often shewn you to be wise  "Your sorrow is useless Do not receive this as merely a commonplace remark but let reason  therefore  restrain sorrow I would not annihilate your feelings my child I would only teach you to command them for whatever may be the evils resulting from a too susceptible heart nothing can be hoped  from an insensible one that on the other hand is all vicevice of which the deformity is not softened or the effect consoled for by any semblance or possibility of good You know my sufferings and are therefore convinced that mine are not the light words which on these occasions are so often repeated to destroy even the sources of honest emotion or which merely display the selfish ostentation of a false philosophy I will shew my Emily that I can practise what I advise I have said thus much because I cannot bear to see you wasting in useless sorrow for want of that resistance which is due from mind and I have not said it till now because there is a period when all reasoning must yield to nature that is past and another when excessive indulgence having sunk into habit weighs down the elasticity of the spirits so as to render conquest nearly impossible this is to come You my Emily will shew that you are willing to avoid it"  Emily smiled through her tears upon her  father "Dear Sir" said she and her voice trembled she would have added "I will shew myself worthy of being your daughter" but a mingled emotion of gratitude affection and grief overcame her St Aubert suffered her to weep without interruption and then began to talk on common topics  The first person who came to condole with St Aubert was an M Barreaux an austere and seemingly unfeeling man A taste for botany had introduced them to each other for they had frequently met in their wanderings among the mountains M Barreaux had retired from the world and almost from society to live in a pleasant chateau on the skirts of the woods near La Vallée He also had been disappointed in his opinion of mankind but he did not like St Aubert pity and mourn for them he felt more indignation at their vices than compassion for their weaknesses  St Aubert was somewhat surprised to see him for though he had often pressed him  to come to the chateau he had never till now accepted the invitation and now he came without ceremony or reserve entering the parlour as an old friend The claims of misfortune appeared to have softened down all the ruggedness and prejudices of his heart St Aubert unhappy seemed to be the sole idea that occupied his mind It was in manners more than in words that he appeared to sympathize with his friends he spoke little on the subject of their grief but the minute attention he gave them and the modulated voice and softened look that accompanied it came from his heart and spoke to theirs  At this melancholy period St Aubert was likewise visited by Madame Cheron his only surviving sister who had been some years a widow and now resided on her own estate near Tholouse The intercourse between them had not been very frequent In her condolements words were not wanting she understood not the magic of the look that speaks at once to the soul or the voice  that sinks like balm to the heart but she assured St Aubert that she sincerely sympathized with him praised the virtues of his late wife and then offered what she considered to be consolation Emily wept unceasingly while she spoke St Aubert was tranquil listened to what she said in silence and then turned the discourse upon another subject  At parting she pressed him and her niece to make her an early visit "Change of place will amuse you" said she "and it is wrong to give way to grief" St Aubert acknowledged the truth of these words of course but at the same time felt more reluctant than ever to quit the spot which his past happiness had consecrated The presence of his wife had sanctified every surrounding scene and each day as it gradually softened the acuteness of his suffering assisted the tender enchantment that bound him to home  But there were calls which must be complied with and of this kind was the visit he  paid to his brotherinlaw M Quesnel An affair of an interesting nature made it necessary that he should delay this visit no longer and wishing to rouse Emily from her dejection he took her with him to Epourville  As the carriage entered upon the forest that adjoined his paternal domain his eyes once more caught between the chesnut avenue the turreted corners of the chateau He sighed to think of what had passed since he was last there and that it was now the property of a man who neither revered nor valued it At length he entered the avenue whose lofty trees had so often delighted him when a boy and whose melancholy shade was now so congenial with the tone of his spirits Every feature of the edifice distinguished by an air of heavy grandeur appeared successively between the branches of the treesthe broad turret the arched gateway that led into the courts the drawbridge and the dry fosse which surrounded the whole  The found of carriage wheels brought a  troop of servants to the great gate where St Aubert alighted and from which he led Emily into the gothic halsl now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family These were displaced and the oak wainscotting and beams that crossed the roof were painted white The large table too that used to stretch along the upper end of the hall where the master of the mansion loved to display his hospitality and whence the peal of laughter and the song of conviviality had so often resounded was now removed even the benches that had surrounded the hall were no longer there The heavy walls were hung with frivolous ornaments and every thing that appeared denoted the false taste and corrupted sentiments of the present owner  St Aubert followed a gay Parisian servant to a parlour where sat Mons and Madame Quesnel who received him with a stately politeness and after a few formal words of condolement seemed to have forgotten that they ever had a sister  Emily felt tears swell into her eyes and then resentment checked them St Aubert calm and deliberate preserved his dignity without assuming importance and Quesnel was depressed by his presence without exactly knowing wherefore  After some general conversation St Aubert requested to speak with him alone and Emily being left with Madame Quesnel soon learned that a large party was invited to dine at the chateau and was compelled to hear that nothing which was past and irremediable ought to prevent the festivity of the present hour  St Aubert when he was told that company were expected felt a mixed emotion of disgust and indignation against the insensibility of Quesnel which prompted him to return home immediately But he was informed that Madame Cheron had been asked to meet him and when he looked at Emily and considered that a time might come when the enmity of her uncle would be prejudicial to her he determined not to  incur it himself by conduct which would be resented as indecorous by the very persons who now shewed so little sense of decorum  Among the visitors assembled at dinner were two Italian gentlemen of whom one was named Montoni a distant relation of Madame Quesnel a man about forty of an uncommonly handsome person with features manly and expressive but whose countenance exhibited upon the whole more of the haughtiness of command and the quickness of discernment than of any other character  Signor Cavigni his friend appeared to be about thirtyhis inferior indignity but equal to him in penetration of countenance and superior in insinuation of manner  Emily was shocked by the salutation with which Madame Cheron met her father"Dear brother" said she "I am concerned to see you look so very ill do pray have advice" St Aubert answered with a melancholy smile that he felt himself much as usual but Emily's fears made her now fancy  that her father looked worse than he really did  Emily would have been amused by the new characters she saw and the varied conversation that passed during dinner which was served in a style of splendour she had seldom seen before had her spirits been less oppressed Of the guests Signor Montoni was lately come from Italy and he spoke of the commotions which at that period agitated the country talked of party differences with warmth and then lamented the probable consequences of the tumults His friend spoke with equal ardour of the politics of his country praised the government and prosperity of Venice and boasted of its decided superiority over all the other Italian states He then turned to the ladies and talked with the same eloquence of Parisian fashions the French opera and French manners and on the latter subject he did not fail to mingle what is so particularly agreeable to French taste The flattery was not detected by  those to whom it was addressed though its effect in producing submissive attention did not escape his observation When he could disengage himself from the assiduities of the other ladies he sometimes addressed Emily but she knew nothing of Parisian fashions or Parisian operas and her modesty simplicity and correct manners formed a decided contrast to those of her female companions  After dinner St Aubert stole from the room to view once more the old chesnut which Quesnel talked of cutting down As he stood under its shade and looked up among its branches still luxuriant and saw here and there the blue sky trembling between them the pursuits and events of his early days crowded fast to his mind with the figures and characters of friendslong since gone from the earth and he now felt himself to be almost an insulated being with nobody but his Emily for his heart to turn to  He stood lost amid the scenes of years which fancy called up till the succession  closed with the picture of his dying wife and he started away to forget it if possible at the social board  St Aubert ordered his carriage at an early hour and Emily observed that he was more than unusually silent and dejected on the way home but she considered this to be the effect of his visit to a place which spoke so eloquently of former times nor suspected that he had a cause of grief which he concealed from her  On entering the chateau she felt more depressed than ever for she more than ever missed the presence of that dear parent who whenever she had been from home used to welcome her return with smiles and fondness now all was silent and forsaken  But what reason and effort may fail to do time effects Week after week passed away and each as it passed stole something from the harshness of her affliction till it was mellowed to that tenderness which the feeling heart cherishes as sacred St Aubert on the contrary visibly declined in health  though Emily who had been so constantly with him was almost the last person who observed it His constitution had never recovered from the late attack of the fever and the succeeding shock it had received from Madame St Aubert's death had produced its present infirmity His physician now ordered him to travel for it was perceptible that sorrow had seized upon his nerves weakened as they had been by the preceding illness and variety of scene it was probable would by amusing his mind restore them to their proper tone  For some days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend him and he by endeavours to diminish his expences at home during the journeya purpose which determined him at length to dismiss his domestics Emily seldom opposed her father's wishes by questions or remonstrances or she would now have asked why he did not take a servant and have represented that his infirm health made one almost necessary But when on the eve of their departure she  found that he had dismissed Jacques Francis and Mary and detained only Theresa the old housekeeper she was extremely surprised and ventured to ask his reason for having done so "To save expences my dear" he replied"we are going on an expensive excursion"  The physician had prescribed the air of Languedoc and Provence and St Aubert determined therefore to travel leisurely along the shores of the Mediterranean towards Provence  They retired early to their chamber on the night before their departure but Emily had a few books and other things to collect and the clock had struck twelve before she had finished or had remembered that some of her drawing instruments which she meant to take with her were in the parlour below As she went to fetch these she passed her father's room and perceiving the door half open concluded that he was in his studyfor since the death of Madame St Aubert it had been frequently  his custom to rise from his restless bed and go thither to compose his mind When she was below stairs she looked into this room but without finding him and as she returned to her chamber she tapped at his door and receiving no answer stepped softly in to be certain whether he was there  The room was dark but a light glimmered through some panes of glass that were placed in the upper part of a closetdoor Emily believed her father to be in the closet and surprised that he was up at so late an hour apprehended he was unwell and was going to enquire but considering that her sudden appearance at this hour might alarm him she removed her light to the staircafe and then stepped softly to the closet On looking through the panes of glass she saw him seated at a small table with papers before him some of which he was reading with deep attention and interest during which he often wept and sobbed aloud Emily who had come to the door to learn whether her father was ill was  now detained there by a mixture of curiosity  nd tenderness She could not witness his sorrow without being anxious to know the subject of it and she therefore continued  o observe him in silence concluding that those papers were letters of her late mother Presently he knelt down and with look so solemn as she had seldom seen him assume and which was mingled with a certain wild expression that partook more of  orror than of any other character he pray  d silently for a considerable time  When he rose a ghastly paleness was on  is countenance Emily was hastily retir  g but she saw him turn again to the  apers and she stopped He took from  mong them a small case and from thence  miniature picture The rays of light fell  rongly upon it and she perceived it to be  at of a lady but not of her mother  St Aubert gazed earnestly and tenderly  pon this portrait put it to his lips and then  his heart and sighed with a convulsive  rce Emily could scarcely believe what  she saw to be real She never knew till now that he had a picture of any other lady than her mother much less that he had one which he evidently valued so highly but having looked repeatedly to be certain that it was not the resemblance of Madame St Aubert she became entirely convinced that it was designed for that of some other person  At length St Aubert returned the picture into its case and Emily recollecting that she was intruding upon his private sorrows softly withdrew from the chamber  CHAP III  O how canst thou renounce the boundless store  Of charms which nature to her vot'ry yields  The warbling woodland the resounding shore  The pomp of groves and garniture of fields  All that the genial ray of morning gilds  And all that echoes to the song of even  All that the mountain's shelt'ring bosom shields  And all the dread magnificence of heaven  O how canst thou renounce and hope to be forgiven  These charms shall work thy soul's eternal health  And love and gentleness and joy impart  THE MINSTREL  ST Aubert instead of taking the more direct road that ran along the feet of the Pyrenées to Languedoc chose one that winding over the heights afforded more extensive views and greater variety of romantic scenery He turned a little out of his way to take leave of M Barreaux whom he found botanizing in the wood near his chateau and who when he was told the purpose  of St Aubert's visit expressed a degree of concern such as his friend had thought it was scarcely possible for him to feel on any similar occasion They parted with mutual regret  "If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement" said M Barreaux "it would have been the pleasure of accompanying you on this little tour I do not often offer compliments you may therefore believe me when I say that I shall look for your return with impatience"  The travellers proceeded on their journey As they ascended the heights St Aubert often looked back upon his chateau in the plain below tender images crowded to his mind his melancholy imagination suggested that he should return no more and though he checked this wandering thought still he continued to look till the haziness of distance blended his home with the general landscape and St Aubert seemed to "Drag at each remove a lengthening chain"  He and Emily continued sunk in musing silence for some leagues from which melancholy reverie Emily first awoke and her young fancy struck with the grandeur of the objects around gradually yielded to delightful impressions The road now descended into glens confined by stupendous walls of rock grey and barren except where shrubs fringed their summits or patches of meagre vegetation tinted their recesses in which the wild goat was frequently browsing And now the way led to the lofty cliffs from whence the landscape was seen extending in all its magnificence  Emily could not restrain her transport as she looked over the pine forests of the mountains upon the vast plains that enriched with woods towns blushing vines and plantations of almonds palms and olives stretched along till their various colours melted in distance into one harmonious hue that seemed to unite earth with heaven Through the whole of this glorious scene the majestic Garonne wandered descending from its  source among the Pyrenées and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay  The ruggedness of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to alight from their little carriage but they thought themselves amply repaid for this inconvenience by the grandeur of the scenes and while the muleteer led his animals slowly over the broken ground the travellers had leisure to linger and these solitudes and to indulge the sublime reflections which soften while they elevate the heart and fill it with the certainty of a present God Still the enjoyment of St Aubert was touched with that pensive melancholy which gives to every object a mellower tint and breathes a sacred charm over all around  They had provided against part of the evil to be encountered from a want of convenient inns by carrying a stock of provisions in the carriage so that they might take refreshment on any pleasant spot in the open air and pass the nights whereever they should happen to meet with a  comfortable cottage For the mind also they had provided by a work on botany written by M Barreaux and by several of the Latin and Italian poets while Emily's pencil enabled her to preserve some of those combinations of forms which charmed her at every step  The loneliness of the road where only now and then a peasant was seen driving his mule or some mountaineerchildren at play among the rocks heightened the effect of the scenery St Aubert was so much struck with it that he determined if he could hear of a road to penetrate further among the mountains and bending his way rather more to the south to emerge into Rousillon and coast the Mediterranean along part of that country to Languedoc  Soon after midday they reached the summit of one of those cliffs which bright with the verdure of palm trees adorn like gems the tremendous walls of the rocks and which overlooked the greater part of Gascony and part of Languedoc  Here was shade and the fresh water of a spring that gliding among the turf under the trees thence precipitated itself from rock to rock till its dashing murmurs were lost in the abyss though its white foam was long seen amid the darkness of the pines below  This was a spot well suited for rest and the travellers alighted to dine while the mules were unharnessed to browse on the savoury herbs that enriched this summit  It was some time before St Aubert or Emily could withdraw their attention from the surrounding objects so as to partake of their little repast Seated in the shade of the palms St Aubert pointed out to her observation the course of the rivers the situation of great towns and the boundaries of provinces which science rather than the eye enabled him to describe Notwithstanding this occupation when he had talked awhile he suddenly became silent thoughtful and tears often swelled to his eyes which Emily observed and the sympathy of her own  heart told her their cause The scene before them bore some resemblance though it was on a much grander scale to a favourite one of the late Madame St Aubert within view of the fishinghouse They both observed this and thought how delighted she would have been with the present landscape while they knew that her eyes must never never more open upon this world St Aubert remembered the last time of his visiting that spot in company with her and also the mournfully presaging thoughts which had then arisen in his mind and were now even thus soon realized The recollections subdued him and he abruptly rose from his seat and walked away to where no eye could observe his grief  When he returned his countenance had recovered its usual serenity he took Emily's hand pressed it affectionately without speaking and soon after called to the muleteer who sat at a little distance concerning a road among the mountains towards  Rousillon Michael said there were several that way but he did not know how far they extended or even whether they were passable and St Aubert who did not intend to travel after sun set asked what village they could reach about that time The muleteer calculated that they could easily reach Mateau which was in their present road but that if they took a road that sloped more to the south towards Rousillon there was a hamlet which he thought they could gain before the evening shut in  St Aubert after some hesitation determined to take the latter course and Michael having finished his meal and harnessed his mules again set forward but soon stopped and St Aubert saw him doing homage to a cross that stood on a rock impending over their way Having concluded his devotions he smacked his whip in the air and in spite of the rough road and the pain of his poor mules which he had been lately lamenting rattled in a full gallop along the edge of a precipice which it made the eye dizzy  to look down Emily was terrified almost to fainting and St Aubert apprehending still greater danger from suddenly stopping the driver was compelled to sit quietly and trust his fate to the strength and discretion of the mules who seemed to possess a greater portion of the latter quality than their master for they carried the travellers safely into the valley and there stopped upon the brink of the rivulet that watered it  Leaving the splendour of extensive prospects they now entered this narrow valley screened by  Rocks on rocks piled as if by magic spell  Here scorch'd by lightnings there with ivy green  The scene of barrenness was here and there interrupted by the spreading branches of the larch and cedar which threw their gloom over the cliff or a hwart the torrent that rolled in the vale No living creature appeared except the izard scrambling among the rocks and often hanging upon points so dangerous that fancy shrunk from  the view of them This was such a scene as  Salvator  would have chosen had he then existed for his canvass St Aubert impressed by the romantic character of the place almost expected to see banditti start from behind some projecting rock and be kept his hand upon the arms with which he always travelled  As they advanced the valley opened its savage features gradually softened and towards evening they were among heathy mountains stretched in far perspective along which the solitary sheepbell was heard and the voice of the shepherd calling his wandering flocks to the nightly fold His cabin partly shadowed by the corktree and the ilex which St Aubert observed to flourish in higher regions of the air than any other trees except the fir was all the human habitation that yet appeared Along the bottom of this valley the most vivid verdure was spread and in the little hollow recesses of the mountains under the shade of the oak and chesnut herds of cattle  were grazing Groups of them too were often seen reposing on the banks of the rivulet or laving their sides in the cool stream and sipping its wave  The sun was now setting upon the valley its last light gleamed upon the water and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and broom that overspread the mountains St Aubert enquired of Michael the distance to the hamlet he had mentioned but the man could not with certainty tell and Emily began to fear that he had mistaken the road Here was no human being to assist or direct them they had left the shepherd and his cabin far behind and the scene became so obscured in twilight that the eye could not follow the distant perspective of the valley in search of a cottage or a hamlet A glow of the horizon still marked the west and this was of some little use to the travellers Michael seemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by singing his music however was not of a kind to disperse melancholy he sung in a sort of  chant one of the most dismal ditties his present auditors had ever heard and St Aubert at length discovered it to be a vesperhymn to his favourite saint  They travelled on sunk in that thoughtful melancholy with which twilight and solitude impress the mind Michael had now ended his ditty and nothing was heard but the drowsy murmur of the breeze among the woods and its light flutter as it blew freshly into the carriage They were at length roused by the sound of firearms St Aubert called to the muleteer to stop and they listened The noise was not repeated but presently they heard a rustling among the brakes St Aubert drew forth a pistol and ordered Michael to proceed as fast as possible who had not long obeyed before a horn sounded that made the mountains ring He looked again from the window and then saw a young man spring from the bushes into the road followed by a couple of dogs The stranger was in a hunter's dress His gun was slung across his shoulders  the hunter's horn hung from his belt and in his hand was a small pike which as he held it added to the manly grace of his figure and assisted the agility of his steps  After a moment's hesitation St Aubert again stopped the carriage and waited till he came up that they might enquire concerning the hamlet they were in search of The stranger informed him that it was only half a league distant that he was going thither himself and would readily shew the way St Aubert thanked him for the offer and pleased with his chevalierlike air and open countenance asked him to take a seat in the carriage which the stranger with an acknowledgment declined adding that he would keep pace with the mules "But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated" said he "the inhabitants of these mountains are a simple people who are not only without the luxuries of life but almost destitute of what in other places are held to be its necessaries"  "I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants sir" said St Aubert  "No sir I am only a wanderer here"  The carriage drove on and the increasing dusk made the travellers very thankful that they had a guide the frequent glens too that now opened among the mountains would likewise have added to their perplexity Emily as she looked up one of these saw something at a great distance like a bright cloud in the air "What light is yonder sir" said she St Aubert looked and perceived that it was the snowy summit of a mountain so much higher than any around it that it still reflected the sun's rays while those below lay in deep shade  At length village lights were seen to twinkle through the dusk and soon after some cottages were discovered in the valley or rather were seen by reflection in the stream on whose margin they stood and which still gleamed with the evening light  The stranger now came up and St Aubert  on further enquiry found not only that there was no inn in the place but not any sort of house of public reception The stranger however offered to walk on and enquire for a cottage to accommodate them for which further civility St Aubert returned his thanks and said that as the village was so near he would alight and walk with him Emily followed slowly in the carriage  On the way St Aubert asked his companion what success he had had in the chase "Not much sir" he replied "nor do I aim at it I am pleased with the country and mean to saunter away a few weeks among its scenes My dogs I take with me more for companionship than for game This dress too gives me an ostensible business and procures me that respect from the people which would perhaps be refused to a lonely stranger who had no visible motive for coming among them"  "I admire your taste" said St Aubert "and if I was a younger man should like to  pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly I too am a wanderer but neither my plan nor pursuits are exactly like yoursI go in search of health as much as of amusement" St Aubert sighed and paused and then seeming to recollect himself he resumed "If I can hear of a tolerable road that shall afford decent accommodation it is my intention to pass into Rousillon and along the seashore to Languedoc You sir seem to be acquainted with the country and can perhaps give me information on the subject"  The stranger said that what information he could give was entirely at his service and then mentioned a road rather more to the east which led to a town whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon  They now arrived at the village and commenced their search for a cottage that would afford a night's lodging In several which they entered ignorance poverty and mirth seemed equally to prevail and the owners eyed St Aubert with a mixture of curiosity  and timidity Nothing like a bed could be found and he had ceased to enquire for one when Emily joined him who observed the languor of her father's countenance and lamented that he had taken a road so ill provided with the comforts necessary for an invalid Other cottages which they examined seemed somewhat less savage than the former consisting of two rooms if such they could be called the first of these occupied by mules and pigs the second by the family which generally consisted of fix or eight children with their parents who slept on beds of skins and dried beech leaves spread upon a mud floor Here light was admitted and smoke discharged through an aperture in the roof and here the scent of spirits for the travelling smugglers who haunted the Pyrenées had made this rude people familiar with the use of liquors was generally perceptible enough Emily turned from such scenes and looked at her father with anxious tenderness which the young stranger seemed to observe for  drawing St Aubert aside he made him an offer of his own bed "It is a decent one" said he "when compared with what we have just seen yet such as in other circumstances I should be ashamed to offer you" St Aubert acknowledged how much he felt himself obliged by this kindness but refused to accept it till the young stranger would take no denial "Do not give me the pain of knowing sir" said he "that an invalid like you lies on hard skins while I sleep in a bed Besides sir your refusal wounds my pride I must believe you think my offer unworthy your acceptance Let me shew you the way I have no doubt my landlady can accommodate this young lady also"  St Aubert at length confented that if this could be done he would accept his kindness though he felt rather surprised that the stranger had proved himself so deficient in gallantry as to administer to the repose of an infirm man rather than to that of a very lovely young woman for he had  not once offered the room for Emily But she thought nor of herself and the animated smile she gave him told how much she felt herself obliged for the preference of her father  On their way the stranger whose name was Valancourt stepped on first to speak to his hostess and she came out to welcome St Aubert into a cottage much superior to any he had seen This good woman seemed very willing to accommodate the strangers who were soon compelled to accept the only two beds in the place Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded but against scarcity of provisions St Aubert had provided and he requested Valancourt to stay and partake with him of less homely fare an invitation which was readily accepted and they passed an hour in intelligent conversation St Aubert was much pleased with the manly frankness and keen susceptibillty to the grrandeur of nature which his new acquaintance discovered and indeed he had often been heared to say  that without a certain simplicity of heart this taste could not exist in any strong degree  The conversation was interrupted by a violent uproar without in which the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other sound Valancourt started from his seat and went to enquire the occasion but the dispute continued so long afterwards that St Aubert went himself and found Michael quarrelling with the hostess because she had refused to let his mules lie in a little room where he and three of her sons were to pass the night The place was wretched enough but there was no other for these people to sleep in and with somewhat more of delicacy than was usual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of country she persisted in refusing to let the animals have the same  bedchamber  with her children This was a tender point with the muleteer his honour was wounded when his mules were treated with disrespect and he would have received a blow perhaps with more meekness He  declared that his beasts were as honest beasts and as good beasts as any in the whole province and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they went "They are as harmless as lambs" said he "if people don't affront them I never knew them behave themselves amiss above once or twice in my life and then they had good reason for doing so Once indeed they kicked at a boy's leg that lay asleep in the stable and broke it but I told them they were out there and by Saint Anthony I believe they understood me for they never did so again"  He concluded this eloquent harangue with protesting that they should share with him go where he would  The dispute was at length settled by Valancourt who drew the hostess aside and desired she would let the muleteer and his beasts have the place in question to themselves while her sons should have the bed of skins designed for him for that he would wrap himself in his cloak and sleep on the  bench by the cottage door But this she thought it her duty to oppose and she felt it to be her inclination to disappoint the muleteer Valancourt however was positive and the tedious affair was at length settled  It was late when St Aubert and Emily retired to their rooms and Valancourt to his station at the door which at this mild season he preferred to a close cabin and a bed of skins St Aubert was somewhat surprised to find in his room volumes of Homer Horace and Petrarch but the name of Valancourt written in them told him to whom they belonged  CHAP IV  In truth he was a strange and wayward wight  Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene  In darkness and in storm he found delight  Nor less than when on oceanwave serene  The southern sun diffus'd his dazzling sheen  Even sad vicissitude amus'd his soul  And if a sigh would sometimes intervene  And down his cheek a tear of pity roll  A sigh a tear so sweet he wish'd not to controul  THE MINSTREL  ST Aubert awoke at an early hour refreshed by sleep and desirous to set forward He invited the stranger to breakfast with him and talking again of the road Valancourt said that some months past he had travelled as far as Beaujeu which was a town of some consequence on the way to Rousillon He recommended it to St Aubert to take that route and the latter determined to do so  "The road from this hamlet" said Valancourt "and that to Beaujeu part at the distance of about a league and an half from hence if you will give me leave I will direct your muleteer so far I must wander somewhere and your company would make this a pleasanter ramble than any other I could take"  St Aubert thankfully accepted his offer and they set out together the young stranger on foot for he refused the invitation of St Aubert to take a seat in his little carriage  The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a pastoral valley bright with verdure and varied with groves of dwarf oak beech and sycamore under whose branches herds of cattle reposed The mountainash too and the weeping birch often threw their pendant foliage over the steeps above where the scanty soil scarcely concealed their roots and where their light branches waved to every breeze that fluttered from the mountains  The travellers were frequently met at this early hour for the sun had not yet risen upon the valley by shepherds driving immense flocks from their folds to feed upon the hills St Aubert had set out thus early not only that he might enjoy the first appearance of sunrise but that he might inhale the first pure breath of morning which above all things is refreshing to the spirits of the invalid In these regions it was particularly so where an abundance of wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed forth their essence on the air  The dawn which softened the scenery with its peculiar grey tint now dispersed and Emily watched the progress of the day first trembling on the tops of the highest cliffs then touching them with splendid light while their sides and the vale below were still wrapt in dewy mist Meanwhile the sullen grey of the eastern clouds began to blush then to redden and then to glow with a thousand colours till the golden light darted over all the air touched  the lower points of the mountain's brow and glanced in long sloping beams upon the valley and its stream All nature seemed to have awakened from death into life the spirit of St Aubert was renovated His heart was full hewept and his thoughts ascended to the Great Creator  Emily wished to trip along the turf so green and bright with dew and to taste the full delight of that liberty which the izard seemed to enjoy as he bounded along the brow of the cliffs while Valancourt often stopped to speak with the travellers and with social feeling to point out to them the peculiar objects of his admiration St Aubert was pleased with him "Here is the real ingenuousness and ardour of youth" said he to himself "this young man has never been at Paris"  He was sorry when they came to the spot where the roads parted and his heart took a more affectionate leave of him than is usual after so short an acquaintance Valancourt talked long by the side of the carriage  seemed more than once to be going but still lingered and appeared to search anxiously for topics of conversation to account for his delay At length he took leave As he went St Aubert observed him look with an earnest and pensive eye at Emily who bowed to him with a countenance full of timid sweetness while the carriage drove on St Aubert for whatever reason soon after looked from the window and saw Valancourt standing upon the bank of the road resting on his pike with folded arms and following the carriage with his eyes He waved his hand and Valancourt seeming to awake from his reverie returned the salute and started away  The aspect of the country now began to change and the travellers soon found themselves among mountains covered from their base nearly to their summits with forests of gloomy pine except where a rock of granite shot up from the vale and lost its snowy top in the clouds The rivulte  which had hitherto accompanied them now expanded into a river and flowing deeply and silently along reflected as in a mirror the blackness of the impending shades Sometimes a cliff was seen lifting its bold head above the woods and the vapours that floated midway down the mountains and sometimes a face of perpendicular marble rose from the water's edge over which the larch threw his gigantic arms here scathed with lightning and there floating in luxuriant foliage  They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road seeing now and then at a distance the solitary shepherd with his dog stalking along the valley and hearing only the dashing of torrents which the woods concealed from the eye the long sullen murmur of the breeze as it swept over the pines or the notes of the eagle and the vulture which were seen towering round the beetling cliff  Often as the carriage moved slowly over uneven ground St Aubert alighted  and amused himself with examining the curious plants that grew on the banks of the road and with which these regions abound while Emily wrapt in high enthusiasm wandered away under the shades listening in deep silence to the lonely murmur of the woods  Neither village nor hamlet was seen for many leagues the goatherd's or the hunter's cabin perched among the cliffs of the rocks were the only human habitations that appeared  The travellers again took their dinner in the open air on a pleasant spot in the valley under the spreading shade of cedars and then set forward towards Beaujeu  The road now began to ascend and leaving the pine forests behind wound among rocky precipices The evening twilight again fell over the scene and the travellers were ignorant how far they might yet be from Beaujeu St Aubert however conjectured that the distance could not be very great and comforted  himself with the prospect of travelling on a more frequented road after reaching that town where he designed to pass the night Mingled woods and rocks and heathy mountains were now seen obscurely through the dusk but soon even these imperfect images faded in darkness Michael proceeded with caution for he could scarcely distinguish the road his mules however seemed to have more sagacity and their steps were sure  On turning the angle of a mountain a light appeared at a distance that illumined the rocks and the horizon to a great extent It was evidently a large fire but whether accidental or otherwise there were no means of knowing St Aubert thought it was probably kindled by some of the numerous banditti that infested the Pyrenées and he became watchful and anxious to know whether the road passed near this fire He had arms with him which on an emergency might afford some protection though certainly a very unequal one against  a band of robbers so desperate too as those usually were who haunted these wild regions While many reflections rose upon his mind he heard a voice shouting from the road behind and ordering the muleteer to stop St Aubert bade him proceed as fast as possible but either Michael or his mules were obstinate for they did not quit the old pace Horses' feet were now heard a man rode up to the carriage still ordering the driver to stop and St Aubert who could no longer doubt his purpose was with difficulty able to prepare a pistol for his defence when his hand was upon the door of the chaise The man staggered on his horse the report of the pistol was followed by a groan and St Aubert's horror may be imagined when in the next instant he thought he heard the faint voice of Valancourt He now himself bade the muleteer stop and pronouncing the name of Valancourt was answered in a voice that no longer suffered him to doubt St Aubert who instantly  alighted and went to his assistance found him still sitting on his horse but bleeding profusely and appearing to be in great pain though he endeavoured to soften the terror of St Aubert by assurances that he was not materially hurt the wound being only in his arm St Aubert with the muleteer assisted him to dismount and he sat down on the bank of the road where St Aubert tried to bind up his arm but his hands trembled so excessively that he could not accomplish it and Michael being now gone in pursuit of the horse which on being disengaged from his rider had galloped off he called Emily to his assistance Receiving no answer he went to the carriage and found her sunk on the seat in a fainting fit Between the distress of this circumstance and that of leaving Valancourt bleeding he scarcely knew what he did he endeavoured however to raise her and called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that flowed by the road but Michael was gone beyond the reach of  his voice Valancourt who heard these calls and also the repeated name of Emily instantly understood the subject of his distress and almost forgetting his own condition he hastened to her relief She was reviving when he reached the carriage and then understanding that anxiety for him had occasioned her indisposition he assured her in a voice that trembled but not from anguish that his wound was of no consequence While he said this St Aubert turned round and perceiving that he was still bleeding the subject of his alarm changed again and he hastily formed some handkerchiefs into a bandage This stopped the effusion of the blood but St Aubert dreading the consequence of the wound enquired repeatedly how far they were from Beaujeu when learning that it was at two leagues distance his distress increased since he knew not how Valancourt in his present state would bear the motion of the carriage and perceived that he was already faint from loss of blood When he  mentioned the subject of his anxiety Valancourt entreated that he would not suffer himself to be thus alarmed on his account for that he had no doubt he should be able to support himself very well and then he talked of the accident as a slight one The muleteer being now returned with Valancourt's horse assisted him into the chaise and as Emily was now revived they moved slowly on towards Beaujeu  St Aubert when he had recovered from the terror occasioned him by this accident expressed surprise on seeing Valancourt who explained his unexpected appearance by saying "You Sir renewed my taste for society when you had left the hamlet it did indeed appear a solitude I determined therefore since my object was merely amusement to change the scene and I took this road because I knew it led through a more romantic tract of mountains than the spot I have left Besides" added he hesitating for an instant "I will own and  why should I not that I had some hope of overtaking you"  "And I have made you a very unexpected return for the compliment" said St Aubert who lamented again the rashness which had produced the accident and explained the cause of his late alarm But Valancourt seemed anxious only to remove from the minds of his companions every unpleasant feeling relative to himself and for that purpose still struggled against a sense of pain and tried to converse with gaiety Emily meanwhile was silent except when Valancourt particularly addressed her and there was at those times a tremulous tone in his voice that spoke much  They were now so near the fire which had long flamed at a distance on the blackness of night that it gleamed upon the road and they could distinguish figures moving about the blaze The way winding still nearer they perceived in the valley one of those numerous bands of gipsies which at that period particularly haunted the  wilds of the Pyrenées and lived partly by plundering the traveller Emily looked with some degree of terror on the savage countenances of these people shewn by the sire which heightened the romantic effect of the scenery as it threw a red dusky gleam upon the rocks and on the foliage of the trees leaving heavy masses of shade and regions of obscurity which the eye feared to penetrate  They were preparing their supper a large pot stood by the fire over which several figures were busy The blaze discovered a rude kind of tent round which many children and dogs were playing and the whole formed a picture highly grotesque The travellers saw plainly their danger Valancourt was silent but laid his hand on one of St Aubert's pistols St Aubert drew forth another and Michael was ordered to proceed as fast as possible They passed the place however without being attacked the rovers being  probably unprepared for the opportunity and too busy about their supper to feel much interest at the moment in any thing besides  After a league and a half more passed in darkness the travellers arrived at Beaujeu and drove up to the only inn the place afforded which though superior to any they had seen since they entered the mountains was bad enough  The surgeon of the town was immediately sent for if a surgeon he could be called who prescribed for horses as well as for men and shaved faces at least as dexterously as he set bones After examining Valancourt's arm and perceiving that the bullet had passed through the flesh without touching the bone he dressed it and left him with a solemn prescription of quiet which his patient was not inclined to obey The delight of ease had now succeeded to pain for ease may be allowed to assume a positive quality when contrasted with anguish and his spirits thus reanimated  he wished to partake of the conversation of St Aubert and Emily who released from so many apprehensions were uncommonly cheerful Late as it was however St Aubert was obliged to go out with the landlord to buy meat for supper and Emily who during this interval had been absent as long as she could upon excuses of looking to their accommodation which she found rather better than she expected was compelled to return and converse with Valancourt alone They talked of the character of the scenes they had passed of the natural history of the country of poetry and of St Aubert a subject on which Emily always spoke and listened to with peculiar pleasure  The travellers passed an agreeable evening but St Aubert was fatigued with his journey and as Valancourt seemed again sensible of pain they separated soon after supper  In the morning St Aubert found that Valancourt had passed a restless night  that he was feverish and his wound very painful The surgeon when he dressed it advised him to remain quietly at Beaujeu advice which was too reasonable to be rejected St Aubert however had no favourable opinion of this practitioner and was anxious to commit Valancourt into more skilful hands but learning upon enquiry that there was no town within several leagues which seemed more likely to afford better advice he altered the plan of his journey and determined to await the recovery of Valancourt who with somewhat more ceremony than sincerity made many objections to this delay  By order of his furgeon Valancourt did not go out of the house that day but St Aubert and Emily surveyed with delight the environs of the town situated at the feet of the Pyrenean Alps that rose some in abrupt precipices and others swelling with woods of cedar sir and cypress which stretched nearly to their highest summits The cheerful green of the beech and  mountainash was sometimes seen like a gleam of light amidst the dark verdure of the forest and sometimes a torrent poured its sparkling flood high among the woods  Valancourt's indisposition detained the travellers at Beaujeu several days during which interval St Aubert had observed his disposition and his talents with the philosophic enquiry so natural to him He saw a frank and generous nature full of ardour highly susceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful but impetuous wild and somewhat romantic Valancourt had known little of the world His perceptions were clear and his feelings just his indignanation of an unworthy or his admiration of a generous action were expressed in terms of equal vehemence St Aubert sometimes smiled at his warmth but seldom checked it and often repeated to himself "This young man has never been at Paris" A sigh sometimes followed this silent ejaculation He determined not to leave Valancourt till he should be perfectly recovered and as he was  now well enough to travel though not able to manage his horse St Aubert invited him to accompany him for a few days in the carriage This he the more readily did since he had discovered that Valancourt was of a family of the same name in Gascony with whose respectability he was well acquainted The latter accepted the offer with great pleasure and they again set forward among these romantic wilds towards Rousillon  They travelled leisurely stopping whereever a scene uncommonly grand appeared frequently alighting to walk to an eminence whither the mules could not go from which the prospect opened in greater magnificence and often sauntering over hillocks covered with lavender wild thyme juniper and tamarisc and under the shades of woods between whose boles they caught the long mountainvista sublime beyond any thing that Emily had ever imagined  St Aubert sometimes amused himself with botanizing while Valancourt and Emily strolled on he pointing out to her notice the objects that particularly charmed him and reciting beautiful passages from such of the Latin and Italian poets as he had heard her admire In the pauses of conversation when he thought himself not observed he frequently fixed his eyes pensively on her countenance which expressed with so much animation the taste and energy of her mind and when he spoke again there was a peculiar tenderness in the tone of his voice that defeated any attempt to conceal his sentiments By degrees these silent pauses became more frequent till Emily only betrayed an anxiety to interrupt them and she who had been hitherto reserved would now talk again and again of the woods and the vallies and the mountains to avoid the danger of sympathy and silence  From Beaujeu the road had constantly ascended conducting the travellers into the  higher regions of the air where immense glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors and eternal snow whitened the summits of the mountains They often paused to contemplate these stupendous scenes and seated on some wild cliff where only the ilex or the larch could flourish looked over dark forests of fir and precipices where human foot had never wandered into the glenso deep that the thunder of the torrent which was seen to foam along the bottom was scarcely heard to murmur Over these crags rose others of stupendous height and fantastic shape some shooting into cones others impending far over their base in huge masses of granite along whose broken ridges was often lodged a weight of snow that trembling even to the vibration of a found threatened to bear destruction in its course to the vale Around on every side far as the eye could penetrate were seen only forms of grandeurthe long perspective of mountain tops tinged with ethereal blue or white with snow  vallies of ice and forests of gloomy fir The serenity and clearness of the air in These high regions were particularly delightful to the travellers it seemed to inspire them with a finer spirit and diffused an indescribable complacency over their minds They had no words to express the sublime emotions they felt A solemn expression characterized the feelings of St Aubert tears often came to his eyes and he frequently walked away from his companions Valancourt now and then spoke to point to Emily's notice some feature of the scene The thinness of the atmosphere through which every object came so distinctly to the eye surprised and deluded her who could scarcely believe that objects which appeared so near were in reality so distant The deep silence of these solitudes was broken only at intervals by the scream of the vultures seen cowering round some cliff below or by the cry of the eagle sailing high in the air except when the travellers listened to the hollow  thunder that sometimes muttered at their feet While above the deep blue of the heavens was unobscured by the lightest cloud half way down the mountains long billows of vapour were frequently seen rolling now wholly excluding the country below and now opening and partially revealing its features Emily delighted to observe the grandeur of these clouds as they changed in shape and tints and to watch their various effect on the lower world whose features partly veiled were continually assuming new forms of sublimity  After traversing these regions for many leagues they began to descend towards Rousillon and features of beauty then mingled with the scene Yet the travellers did not look back without some regret to the sublime objects they had quitted though the eye fatigued with the extension of its powers was glad to repose on the verdure of woods and pastures that now hung on the margin of the river below to view again the humble cottage shaded by cedars  the playful group of mountaineerchildren and the flowery nooks that appeared among the hills  As they descended they saw at a distance on the right one of the grand passes of the Pyreneáes into Spain gleaming with its battlements and towers to the splendour of the setting rays yellow tops of woods colouring the steeps below while far above aspired the snowy points of the mountains still reflecting a rosy hue  St Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to by the people of Beaujeu and where he meant to pass the night but no habitation yet appeared Of its distance Valancourt could not assist him to judge for he had never been so far along this chain of Alps before There was however a road to guide them and there could be little doubt that it was the right one for since they had left Beaujeu there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or mislead  The sun now gave his last light and St Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all Possible dispatch He found indeed the lassitude of iliness return upon him after a day of uncommon fatigue both of body and mind and he longed for repose His anxiety was not soothed by Observing a numerous train consisting of men horses and loaded mules winding down the steeps of an opposite mountain appearing and disappearing at intervals among the woods so that its numbers could not be judged of Something bright like arms glanced in the setting ray and the military dress was distinguishable upon the men who were in the van and on others scattered among the troop that followed As these wound into the vale the rear of the party emerged from the woods and exhabited a band of soldiers St Aubert's apprehendsions now subsided he had no doubt that the train before him consisted of smugglers who in conveying prohibited  goods over the Pyrenées had been encountered and conquered by a party of troops  The travellers had lingered so long among the sublimer scenes of these mountains that they found themselves entirely mistaken in their calculation that they could reach Montigny at sunset but as they wound along the valley they saw on a rude Alpine bridge that united two lofty crags of the glen a group of mountaineerchildren amusing themselves with dropping pebbles into a torrent below and watching the stones plunge into the water that threw up its white spray high in the air as it received them and returned a sullen found which the echoes of the mountains prolonged Under the bridge was seen a perspective of the valley with its cataract descending among the rocks and a cottage on a cliff overshadowed with pines It appeared that they could not be far from some small town St Aubert bade the muleteer stop and then called to the children to enquire  if he was near Montigny but the distance and the roaring of the waters would not suffer his voice to be heard and the crags adjoining the bridge were of such tremendous height and steepness that to have climbed either would have been scarcely practicable to a person unacquainted with the ascent St Aubert therefore did not waste more moments in delay They continued to travel long after twilight had obscured the road which was so broken that now thinking it safer to walk than to ride they all alighted The moon was rising but her light was yet too feeble to assist them While they stepped carefully on they heard the vesperbell of a convent The twilight would not permit them to distinguish any thing like a building but the sounds seemed to come from some woods that overhung an acclivity to the right Valancourt proposed to go in search of this convent "If they will not accommodate us with a night's lodging" said he "they may certainly  inform us how far we are from Montigny and direct us towards it" He was bounding forward without waiting St Aubert's reply when the latter stopped him "I am very weary" said St Aubert "and wish for nothing so much as for immediate rest We will all go to the convent your good looks would defeat our purpose but when they see mine and Emily's exhausted countenances they will scarcely deny us repose"  As he said this he took Emily's arm within his and telling Michael to wait a while in the road with the carriage they began to ascend towards the woods guided by the bell of the convent His steps were feeble and Valancourt offered him his arm which he accepted The moon now threw a faint light over their path and soon after enabled them to distinguish some towers rising above the tops of the woods Still following the note of the bell they entered the shade of those woods lighted only by the moonbeams that glided down  between the leaves and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the steep track they were winding The gloom and the silence that prevailed except when the bell returned upon the air together with the wildness of the surrounding scene struck Emily with a degree of fear which however the voice and conversation of Valancourt somewhat repressed When they had been some time ascending St Aubert complained of wearinss and they stopped to rest upon a little green summit where the trees opened and admitted the moonlight He fat down upon the turf between Emily and Valancourt The bell had now ceased and the deep repose of the scene was undisturbed by any found for the low dull murmur of some distant torrents might be said to sooth rather than to interrupt the silence  Before them extended the valley they had quitted its rocks and woods to the left just silvered by the rays formed a contrast to the deep shadow that involved the  opposite cliffs whose fringed summits only were tipped with light while the distant perspective of the valley was lost in the yellow mist of moonlight The travellers sat for some time wrapt in the complacency which such scenes inspire  "Thefe scenes" said Valancourt at length "soften the heart like the notes of sweet music and inspire that delicious melancholy which no person who had felt it once would resign for the gayest pleasures They waken our best and purest feelings disposing us to benevolence pity and friendship Those whom I loveI always seem to love more in such an hour as this" His voice trembled and he paused  St Aubert was silent Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand he held she knew the object of his thoughts hers too had for some time been occupied by the remembrance of her mother He seemed by an effort to rouse himfelf "Yes" said he with an halfsupperssed sigh "the memory of those we loveof times for ever  past in such an hour as this steals upon the mind like a strain of distant music in the stillness of nightall tender and harmonious as this landscape sleeping in the mellow moonlight" After the pause of a moment St Aubert added "I have always fancied that I thought with more clearness and precision at such an hour than at any other and that heart must be insensible in a great degree that does not soften to its influence But many such there are"  Valancourt sighed  "Are there indeed many such" said Emily  "A few years hence my Emily" replied St Aubert "and you may smile at the recollection of that questionif you do not weep to it But come I am somewhat refreshed let us proceed"  Having emerged from the woods they few upon a turfy hillock above the convent of which they were in search An high wall that surrounded it led them to an ancient gate at which they knocked and the  poor monk who opened it conduced them into a small adjoining room where he desired they would wait while he informed the superior of their request In this interval several friars came in separately to look at them and at length the first monk returned and they followed him to a room where the superior was sitting in an arm chair with a large folio volume printed in black letter open on a desk before him He received them with courtesy though he did not rise from his feat and having asked them a few questions grafted their request After a short conversation formal and solemn on the part of the superior they withdrew to the apartment where they were to sup and Valancourt whom one of the inferior friars civilly desired to accompany went to seek Michael and his mules They had not descended half way down the cliffs before they heard the voice of the muleteer echoing far and wide Sometimes he called on St Aubert and sometimes on Valancourt who having at length convinced him  that he had nothing to fear either for himself or his master and having disposed of him for the night in a cottage on the skirt of the woods returned to sup with his friends on such sober fare as the monks thought it prudent to set before them While St Aubert was too much indisposed to share it Emily in her anxiety for her father forgot herself and Valancourt silent and thoughtful yet never inattentive to them appeared particularly solicitous to accommodate and relieve St Aubert who often observed while his daughter was pressing him to eat or adjusting the pillow she had placed in the back of his armchair that Valancourt fixed on her a look of pensive tenderness which he was not displeased to understand  They separated at an early hour and retired to their respective apartments Emily was shown to hers by a nun of the convent whom she was glad to dismiss for her heart was melancholy and her attention so much abstracted that conversation with  a stranger was painful She thought her father daily declining and attributed his present fatigue more to the feeble state of his frame than to the difficulty of the journey A train of gloomy ideas haunted her mind till she fell asleep  In about two hours after she was awakened by the chiming of a bell and then heard quick steps pass along the gallery into which her chamber opened She was so little accustomed to the manners of a convent as to be alarmed by this circumstance her fears ever alive for her father suggested that he was very ill and she rose in haste to go to him Having paused however to let the persons in the gallery pass before she opened her door her thoughts in the mean time recovered from the confusion of sleep and she understood that the bell was the call of the monks to prayers It had now ceased and all being again still she forbore to go to St Aubert's room Her mind was not disposed for immediate sleep and the moonlight that shone into her  chamber invited her to open the casement and look out upon the country  It was a still and beautiful night the sky was unobscured by any cloud and scarce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air As she listened the midnight hymn of the monks rose softly from a chapel that stood on one of the lower cliffs an holy strain that seemed to ascend through the silence of night to heaven and her thoughts ascended with it From the consideration of his works her mind arose to the adoration of the Deity in his goodness and power wherever she turned her view whether on the sleeping earth or to the vast regions of space glowing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought the sublimity of God and the majesty of his presence appeared Her eyes were filled with tears of awful love and admiration and she felt that pure devotion superior to all the distinctions of human system which lifts the soul above this world and seems to expand it into a nobler nature such devotion as  can perhaps only be experienced when the mind rescued for a moment from the humbleness of earthly considerations aspires to contemplate His power in the sublimity of His works and His goodness in the infinity of His blessings  Is it not now the hour  The holy hour when to the cloudless height  Of yon starred concave climbs the fullorbed moon  And to this nether world in solemn stillness  Gives sign that to the listning ear of Heaven  Religion's voice should plead The very babe  Knows this and 'chance awak'd his little hands  Lifts to the gods and on his innocent couch  Calls down a blessing  CARACTACUS    The midnight chant of the monks soon after dropped into silence but Emily remained at the casement watching the setting moon and the valley sinking into deep shade and willing to prolong her present state of mind At length she retired to her matterss and sunk into tranquil slumber  CHAP V  While in the rosy vale  Love breath'd his infant sighs from anguish free  THOMPSON  St AUBERT sufficiently restored by a night's repose to pursue his journey set out in the morning with his family and Valancourt for Rousillon which he hoped to reach before nightfall The scenes through which they now passed were as wild and romantic as any they had yet observed with this difference that beauty every now and then softened the landscape into smiles Little woody recesses appeared among the mountains covered with bright verdure and flowers or a pastoral valley opened its grassy bosom in the shade of the cliffs with flocks and herds loitering along the banks  of a rivulet that refreshed it with perpetual green St Aubert could not repent the having taken this fatiguing road though he was this day also frequently obliged to alight to walk along the rugged precipice and to climb the steep and flinty mountain The wonderful sublimity and variety of the Prospects repaid him for all this and the enthusiasm with which they were viewed by his young companions heightened his own and awakened a remembrance of all the delightful emotions of his early days when the sublime charms of nature were first unveiled to him He found great pleasure in conversing with Valancourt and in listening to his ingenuous remarks The fire and simplicity of his manners seemed to render him a characteristic figure in the scenes around them and St Aubert discovered in his sentiments the justness and the dignity of an elevated mind unbiassed by intercourse with the world He perceived that his opinions were formed rather than imbibed were more the result of thought  than of learning Of the world he seemed to know nothing for he believed well of all mankind and this opinion gave him the reflected image of his own heart  St Aubert as he sometimes lingered to examine the wild plants in his path often looked forward with pleasure to Emily and Valancourt as they strolled on together he with a countenance of animated delight pointing to her attention some grand seature of the scene and she listening and observing with a look of tender seriousness that spoke the elevation of her mind They appeared like two lovers who had never strayed beyond these their native mountains whose situation had secluded them from the frivolities of common life whose ideas were simple and grand like the landscapes among which they moved and who knew no other happiness than in the union of pure and affectionate hearts St Aubert smiled and sighed at the romantic picture of felicity his fancy drew and sighed again to think that nature and simplicity were so little known  to the world as that their pleasures were thought romantic  "The world" said he pursuing this train of thought "ridicules a passion which it seldom feels its scenes and its interests distract the mind deprave the taste corrupt the heart and love cannot exist in a heart that has lost the meek dignity of innocence Virtue and taste are nearly the lame for virtue is little more than active taste and the most delicate affections of each combine in real love How then are we to look for love in great cities where selfishness dissipation and insincerity supply the place of tenderness simplicity and truth"  It was near noon when the travellers having arrived at a piece of steep and dangerous road alighted to walk The road wound up an ascent that was clothed with wood and instead of following the carriage they entered the refreshing shade A dewy coolness was diffused upon the air which with the bright verdure of turf that grew under the trees the mingled fragrance of  flowers and of balm thyme and lavender that enriched it and the grandeur of the pines beech and chesnuts that overshadowed them rendered this amost delicious retreat Sometimes the thick foliage excluded all view of the country at others it admitted some partial catches of the distant seenery which gave hints to the imagination to picture landscapes more interesting more impressive than any that had been presented to the eye The wanderers often lingered to indulge in these reveries of fancy  The pauses of silence such as had formerly interrupted the conversations of Valancourt and Emily were more frequent today than ever Valancourt often dropped suddenly from the most animating vivacity into fits of deep musing and there was sometimes an unaffected melancholy in his smile which Emily could not avoid understanding for her heart was interested in the sentiment it spoke  St Aubert was refreshed by the shades and they continued to saunter under them  following as nearly as they could guess the direction of the road till they perceived that they had totally lost it They had continue I near the brow of the precipice allured by the scenery it exhibited while the road wound far away over the cliff above Valancourt called loudly to Michael but heard no voice except his own echoing among the rocks and his various efforts to regain the road were equally unsuccessful While they were thus circumstanced they perceived a shepherd's cabin between the boles of the trees at some distance and Valancourt bounded on first to ask assistance When he reached it he saw only two little children at play on the turf before the door He looked into the hut but no person was there and the eldest of the boys told him that their father was with his slocks and their mother was gone down into the vale but would be back presently As he stood considering what was further to be done on a sudden he heard Michael's voice roaring forth most manfully among the cliffs above  till he made their echoes ring Valancourt immediately answered the call and endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the steeps following the direction of the sound After much struggle over brambles and precipices he reached Michael and at length prevailed with him to be silent and to listen to him The road was at a considerable distance from the spot where St Aubert and Emily were the carriage could not easily return to the entrance of the wood and since it would be very fatiguing for St Aubert to climb the long and steep road to the place where it now stood Valancourt was anxious to find a more easy ascent by the way he had himself passed  Meanwhile St Aubert and Emily approached the cottage and rested themselves on a rustic bench sastened between two pines which overshadowed it till Valancourt whose steps they had observed should return  The eldest of the children desisted from  his play and stood still to observe the strangers while the younger continued his little gambols and teased his brother to join in them St Aubert looked with pleasure upon this picture of infantine simplicity till it brought to his remembrance his own boys whom he had lost about the age of these and their lamented mother and he sunk into a thoughtfulness which Emily observing she immediately began to sing one of those simple and lively airs he was so fond of and which she knew how to give with the most captivating sweetness St Aubert smiled on her through his tears took her hand and pressed it affectionately and then tried to dissipate the melancholy reflections that lingered in his mind  While she sung Valancourt approached who was unwilling to interrupt her and paused at a little distance to listen When she had concluded he joined the party and told them that he had found Michael as well as a way by which he thought they could ascend the cliff to the carriage He  pointed to the woody steeps above which St Aubert surveyed with an anxious eye He was already wearied by his walk and this ascent was formidable to him He thought however it would be less toilsome than the long and broken road and he determined to attempt it but Emily ever watchful of his ease proposing that he should rest and dine before they proceeded further Valancourt went to the carriage for the refreshments deposited there  On his return he proposed removing a little higher up the mountain to where the woods opened upon a grand and extensive prospect and thither they were preparing to go when they saw a young woman join the children and caress and weep over them  The travellers interested by her distress stopped to observe her She took the youngest of the children in her arms and perceiving the strangers hastily dried her tears and proceeded to the cottage St Aubert on enquiring the occasion of her sorrow learned that her husband who was shepherd and  lived here in the summer months to watch over the flocks he led to feed upon these mountains had lost on the preceding night his little all A gang of gipsies who had for some time infested the neighbourhood had driven away several of his matter's sheep "Jacques" added the shepherd's wife "had saved a little money and had bought a few sheep with it and now they must go to his master for those that are stolen and what is worse than all his master when he comes to know how it is will trust him no longer with the care of his flocks for he is a hard man and then what is to become of our children"  The innocent countenance of the woman and the simplicity of her manner in relating her grievance inclined St Aubert to believe her story and Valancourt convinced that it was true asked eagerly what was the value of the stolen sheep on hearing which he turned away with a look of disappointment St Aubert put some money into her hand Emily too gave something from her little  purse and they walked towards the cliff but Valancourt lingered behind and spoke to the shepherd's wife who was now weeping with gratitude and surprise He enquired how much money was yet wanting to replace the stolen sheep and found that it was a sum very little short of all he had about him He was perplexed and distressed "This sum then" said he to himself "would make this poor family completely happyit is in my power to give itto make them completely happy But what is to become of mehow shall I contrive to reach home with the little money that will remain" For a moment he stood unwilling to forego the luxury of raising a family from ruin to happiness yet considering the difficulties of pursuing his journey with so small a sum as would be left  While he was in this state of perplexity the shepherd himself appeared his children ran to meet him he took one of them in his arms and with the other clinging to  his coat came forward with a loitering step His forlorn and melancholy look determined Valancourt at once he threw down all the money he had except a very few louis and bounded away after St Aubert and Emily who were proceeding slowly up the steep Valancourt had seldom felt his heart so light as at this moment his gay spirits danced with pleasure every object around him appeared more interesting or beautiful than before St Aubert observed the uncommon vivacity of his countenance "What has pleased you so much" said he "O what a lovely day" replied Valancourt "how brightly the sun shines how pure is this air what enchanting scenery" "It is indeed enchanting" said St Aubert whom early experience had taught to understand the nature of Valancourt's present feelings "What pity that the wealthy who can command such sunshine should ever pass their days in gloomin the cold shade of selfishness For you my young friend may the sun always shine as brightly  as at this moment may your own conduct always give you the sunshine of benevolence and reason united"  Valancóurt highly flattered by this compliment could make no reply but by a smile of gratitude  They continued to wind under the woods between the grassy knolls of the mountain and as they reached the shady summit which he had pointed out the whole party burst into an exclamation Behind the spot where they stood the rock rose perpendicularly in a massy wall to a considerable height and then branched out into overhanging crags Their grey tints were well contrasted by the bright hues of the plants and wild flowers that grew in their fractured sides and were deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars that waved above The steeps below over which the eye passed abruptly to the valley were fringed with thickets of alpine shrubs and lower still appeared the tufted tops of the chesnut woods that clothed their base among which peeped forth the shepherd's  cottage just left by the travellers with its blueish smoke curling high in the air On every side appeared the majestic summits of the Pyrenées some exhibiting tremendous crags of marble whose appearance was changing every instant as the varying lights fell upon their surface others still higher displaying only snowy points while their lower steeps were covered almost invariably with forests of pine larch and oak that stretched down to the vale This was one of the narrow vallies that open from the Pyrenées into the country of Rousillon and whose green pastures and cultivated beauty form a decided and wonderful contrast to the romantic grandeur that environs it Through a vista of the mountains appeared the lowlands of Rousillon tinted with the blue haze of distance as they united with the waters of the Mediterranean where on a promontory which marked the boundary of the shore stood a lonely beacon over which were seen circling flights of seafowl Beyond appeared now and then a stealing  sail white with the sunbeam and whose progress was perceivable by its approach to the lighthouse Sometimes too was seen a sail so distant that it served only to mark the line of separation between the sky and the waves  On the other side of the valley immediately opposite to the spot where the travellers rested a rocky pass opened toward Gascony Here no sign of cultivation appeared The rocks of granite that screened the glen rose abruptly from their base and stretched their barren points to the clouds unvaried with woods and uncheered even by a hunter's cabin Sometimes indeed a gigantic larch threw its long shade over the precipice and here and there a cliff reared on its brow a monumental cross to tell the traveller the fate of him who had ventured thither before This spot seemed the very haunt of banditti and Emily as she looked down upon it almost expected to see them stealing out from some hollow cave to look for their prey Soon after an object not less  terrific struck hera gibbet standing on a point of rock near the entrance of the pass and immediately over one of the crosses she had before observed These were hieroglyphics that told a plain arid dreadful story She forbore to point it out to St Aubert but it threw a gloom over her spirits and made her anxious to hasten forward that they might with certainty reach Rousillon before nightfall It was necessary however that St Aubert should take some refreshment and seating themselves on the short dry turf they opened the basket of provisions while  by breezy murmurs cool'd  Broad o'er  their  heads the verdant cedars wave  And high palmetos lift their graceful shade    they  draw  Ethereal soul there drink reviving gales  Profusely breathing from the piney groves  And vales of fragrance there at distance hear  The roaring floods and cataracts  THOMPSON    St Aubert was revived by rest and by the serene air of this summit and Valancourt  was so charmed with all around and with the conversation of his companions that he seemed to have forgotten he had any further to go Having concluded their simple repast they gave a long farewell look to the scene and again began to ascend St Aubert rejoiced when he reached the carriage which Emily entered with him but Valancourt willing to take a more extensive view of the enchanting country into which they were about to descend than he could do from a carriage loosened his dogs and once more bounded with them along the banks of the road He often quitted it for points that promised a wider prospect and the slow pace at which the mules travelled allowed him to overtake them with ease Whenever a scene of uncommon magnificence appeared he hastened to inform St Aubert who though he was too much tired to walk himself sometimes made the chaise wait while Emily went to the neighbouring cliff  It was evening when they descended the  lower alps that bind Rousillon and form a majestic barrier round that charming country leaving it open only on the east to the Mediterranean The gay tints of cultivation once more beautified the landscape for the lowlands were coloured with the richest hues which a luxuriant climate and an industrious people can awaken into life Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the air their ripe fruit glowing among the foliage while sloping to the plains extensive vineyards spread their treasures Beyond these woods and pastures and mingled towns and hamlets stretched towards the sea on whose bright surface gleamed many a distant sail while over the whole scene was diffused the purple glow of evening This landscape with the surrounding alps did indeed present a perfect picture of the lovely and the sublime of "beauty sleeping in the lap of horror"  The travellers having reached the plains proceeded between hedges of flowering myrtle and pomegranate to the town of  Arles where they purposed to rest for the night They met with simple but neat accommodation and would have passed an happy evening after the toils and the delights of this day had not the approaching separation thrown a gloom over their spirits It was St Aubert's plan to proceed on the morrow to the borders of the Mediterranean and travel along its shores into Languedoc and Valancourt since he was now nearly recovered and had no longer a pretence for continuing with his new friends resolved to leave them here St Aubert who was much pleased with him invited him to go further but did not repeat the invitation and Valancourt had resolution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it that he might prove himself not unworthy of the favour On the following morning therefore they were to part St Aubert to pursue his way to Languedoc and Valancourt to explore new scenes among the mountains on his return home During this evening he was often  silent and thoughtful St Aubert's manner towards him was affectionate though grave and Emily was serious though she made frequent efforts to appear cheerful After one of the most melancholy evenings they had yet passed together they separated for the night  CHAP VI  I care not Fortune what you me deny  You cannot rob me of free nature's grace  You cannot shut the windows of the sky  Through which Aurora shews her brightening face  You cannot bar my constant feet to trace  The woods and lawns by living stream at eve  Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace  And I their toys to the great children leave  Of fancy reason virtue nought can me bereave  THOMPSON  IN the morning Valancourt breakfasted with St Aubert and Emily neither of whom seemed much refreshed by sleep The languor of illness still hung over St Aubert and to Emily's fears his disorder appeared to be increasing fast upon him She watched his looks with anxious affecttion and their expression was always faithfully reflected in her own  At the commencement of their acquaintance Valancourt had made known his name and family St Aubert was not a stranger to either for the family estates which were now in the possession of an elder brother of Valancourt were little more than twenty miles distant from La Vallée and he had sometimes met the elder Valancourt on visits in the neighbourhood This knowledge had made him more willingly receive his present companion for though his countenance and manners would have won him the acquaintance of St Aubert who was very apt to trust to the intelligence of his own eyes with respect to countenances he would not have accepted these as sufficient introductions to that of his daughter  The breakfast was almost as silent as the supper of the preceding night but their musing was at length interrupted by the sound of the carriagewheels which were to bear away St Aubert and Emily Valancourt started from his chair and went to the window it was indeed the carriage and  he returned to his seat without speaking The moment was now come when they must part St Aubert told Valancourt that he hoped he would never pass La Vallée without favouring him with a visit and Valancourt eagerly thanking him assured him that he never would as he said which he looked timidly at Emily who tried to smile away the seriousness of her spirits They passed a few minutes in interesting conversation and St Aubert then led the way to the carriage Emily and Valancourt following in silence The latter lingered at the door several minutes after they were seated and none of the party seemed to have courage enough to sayFarewell At length St Aubert pronounced the melancholy word which Emily passed to Valancourt who returned it with a dejected smile and the carriage drove on  The travellers remained for some time in a state of tranquil pensiveness which is not unpleasing St Aubert interrupted it by observing "This is a very promising  young man it is many years since I have been so much pleased with any person on so short an acquaintance He brings back to my memory the days of my youth when every scene was new and delightful" St Aubert sighed and sunk again into a reverie and as Emily looked back upon the road they had passed Valancourt was seen at the door of the little inn following them with his eyes He perceived her and waved his hand and she returned the adieu till the winding road shut her from his sight  "I remember when I was about his age" resumed St Aubert "and I thought and felt exactly as he does The world was opening upon me then nowit is closing"  "My dear sir do not think so gloomily" said Emily in a trembling voice "I hope you have many many years to livefor your own sakefor  my  sake"  "Ah my Emily" replied St Aubert "for thy sake WellI hope it is so" He wiped away a tear that was stealing  down his cheek threw a smile upon his countenance and said in a cheering voice "There is something in the ardour and ingenuousness of youth which is particularly pleasing to the contemplation of an old man if his feelings have not been entirely corroded by the world It is cheering and reviving like the view of spring to a sick person his mind catches somewhat of the spirit of the season and his eyes are lighted up with a transient sunshine Valancourt is this spring to me"  Emily who pressed her father's hand affectionately had never before listened with so much pleasure to the praises he bestowed no not even when he had bestowed them on herself  They travelled on among vineyards woods and pastures delighted with the romantic beauty of the landscape which was bounded on one side by the grandeur of the Pyrenées and on the other by the ocean and soon after noon they reached the town of Colioure situated on the Mediterranean  Here they dined and rested till towards the cool of day when they pursued their way along the shoresthose enchanting shores which extend to Languedoc Emily gazed with enthusiasm on the vastness of the sea its surface varying as the lights and shadows fell and on its woody banks mellowed with autumnal tints  St Aubert was impatient to reach Perpignan where he expected letters from M Quesnel and it was the expectation of these letters that had induced him to leave Colioure for his feeble frame had required immediate rest After travelling a few miles he fell asleep and Emily who had put two or three books into the carriage on leaving La Vallée had now the leisure for looking into them She sought for one in which Valancourt had been reading the day before and hoped for the pleasure of retracing a page over which the eyes of a beloved friend had lately passed of dwelling on the passages which he had admired  and of permitting them to speak to her in the language of his own mind and to bring himself to her presence On searching for the book she could find it no where but in its stead perceived a volume of Petrarch's poems that had belonged to Valancourt whose name was written in it and from which he had frequently read passages to her with all the pathetic expression that characterized the feelings of the author She hesitated in believing what would have been sufficiently apparent to almost any other person that he had purposely left this book instead of the one she had lost and that love had prompted the exchange but having opened it with impatient pleasure and observed the lines of his pencil drawn along the various passages he had read aloud and under others more descriptive of delicate tenderness than he had dared to trust his voice with the conviction came at length to her mind For some moments she was conscious only of being beloved then a recollection of all the variations of  tone and countenance with which he had recited these sonnets and of the soul which spoke in their expreession pressed to her memory and she wept over the memorial of his affection  They arrived at Perpignan soon after sunset where St Aubert found as he had expected letters from M Quesnel the contents of which so evidently and grievously affected him that Emily was alarmed and pressed him as far as her delicacy would permit to disclose the occasion of his concern but he answered her only by tears and immediately began to talk on other topics Emily though she forbore to press the one most interesting to her was greatly affected by her father's manner and passed a night of sleepless solicitude  In the morning they pursued their journey along the coast towards Leucate another town on the Mediterranean situated on the borders of Languedoc and Rousillon On the way Emily renewed the subject of the preceding night and appeared  so deeply affected by St Aubert's silence and dejection that he relaxed from his reserve "I was unwilling my dear Emily" said he "to throw a cloud over the pleasure you receive from these scenes and meant therefore to conceal for the present some circumstances with which however you must at length have been made acquainted But your anxiety has defeated my purpose you suffer as much from this perhaps as you will do from a knowledge of the facts I have to relate M Quesnel's visit proved an unhappy one to me he came to tell me a part of the news he has now confirmed You may have heard me mention an M Motteville of Paris but you did not know that the chief of my personal property was invested in his hands I had great confidence in him and I am yet willing to believe that he is not wholly unworthy of my esteem A variety of circumstances have concurred to ruin him andI am ruined with him"  St Aubert paused to conceal his emotion  "The letters I have just received from M Quesnel" resumed he struggling to speak with firmness "enclosed others from Motteville which confirmed all I dreaded"  "Must we then quit La Vallée" said Emily after a long pause of silence "That is yet uncertain" replied St Aubert "it will depend upon the compromise Motteville is able to make with his creditors My income you know was never large and now it will be reduced to little indeed It is for you Emily for you my child that I am most afflicted" His last words faltered Emily smiled tenderly upon him through her tears and then endeavouring to overcome her emotion "My dear father" said she "do not grieve for me or for yourself we may yet be happyif La Vallée remains for us we must be happy We will retain only one servant and you shall scarcely perceive the change  in your income Be comforted my dear sir we shall notfeel the want of those luxuries which others value so highly since we never had a taste for them and poverty cannot deprive us of many consolations It cannot rob us of the affection we have for each other or degrade us in our own opinion or in that of any person whose opinion we ought to value"  St Aubert concealed his face with his handkerchief and was unable to speak but Emily continued to urge to her father the truths which himself had impressed upon her mind  "Besides my dear sir poverty cannot deprive us of intellectual delights It cannot deprive you of the comfort of affording me examples of fortitude and benevolence nor me of the delight of consoling a beloved parent It cannot deaden our taste for the grand and the beautiful or deny us the means of indulging it for the scenes of naturethose sublime spectacles so infinitely superior to all artificial luxuries are open  for the enjoyment of the poor as well as of the rich Of what then have we to complain so long as we are not in want of necessaries Pleasures such as wealth cannot buy will still be ours We retain then the sublime luxuries of nature and lose only the frivolous ones of art"  St Aubert could not reply he caught Emily to his bosom their tears flowed together butthey were not tears of sorrow After this language of the heart all other would have been feeble and they remained silent for some time Then St Aubert conversed as before for if his mind had not recovered its natural tranquillity it at least assumed the appearance of it  They reached the romantic town of Leucate early in the day but St Aubert was weary and they determined to pass the night there In the evening he exerted himself so far as to walk with his daughter to view the environs that overlook the lake of Leucate the Mediterranean part of Rousillon  with the Pyrenées and a wide extent of the luxuriant province of Languedoc now blushing with the ripened vintage which the peasants were beginning to gather St Aubert and Emily saw the busy groups caught the joyous song that was wasted on the breeze and anticipated with apparent pleasure their next day's journey over this gay region He designed however still to wind along the seashore To return home immediately was partly his wish but from this he was withheld by a desire to lengthen the pleasure which the journey gave his daughter and to try the effect of the sea air on his own disorder  On the following day therefore they recommenced their journey through Languedoc winding the shores of the Mediterranean the Pyrenées still forming the magnificent background of their prospects while on their right was the ocean and on their left wide extended plains melting into the blue horizon St Aubert was pleased and conversed much with Emily  yet his cheerfulness was sometimes artificial and sometimes a shade of melancholy would steal upon his countenance and betray him This was soon chased away by Emily's smile who smiled however with an aching heart for she saw that his misfortunes preyed upon his mind and upon his enfeebled frame  It was evening when they reached a small village of Upper Languedoc where they meant to pass the night but the place could not afford them beds for here too it was the time of the vintage and they were obliged to proceed to the next post The languor of illness and of fatigue which returned upon St Aubert required immediate repose and the evening was now far advanced but from necessity there was no appeal and he ordered Michael to proceed  The rich plains of Languedoc which exhibited all the glories of the vintage with the gaieties of a French festival no longer awakened St Aubert to pleasure whose  condition formed a mournful contrast to the hilarity and youthful beauty which surrounded him As his languid eyes moved over the scene he considered that they would soon perhaps be closed for ever on this world "Those distant and sublime mountains" said he secretly as he gazed on a chain of the Pyrenées that stretched towards the west "these luxuriant plains this blue vault the cheerful light of day will be shut from my eyes The song of the peasant the cheering voice of manwill no longer sound for me"  The intelligent eyes of Emily seemed to read what passed in the mind of her father and she fixed them on his face with an expression of such tender pity as recalled his thoughts from every desultory object of regret and he remembered only that he must leave his daughter without protection This reflection changed regret to agony he sighed deeply and remained silent while she seemed to understand that sigh for she  pressed his hand affectionately and then turned to the window to conceal her tears The sun now threw a last yellow gleam on the waves of the Mediterranean and the gloom of twilight spread fast over the scene till only a melancholy ray appeared on the western horizon marking the point where the sun had set amid the vapours of an autumnal evening A cool breeze now came from the snore and Emily let down the glass but the air which was refreshing to health was as chilling to sickness and St Aubert desired that the window might be drawn up Increasing illness made him now more anxious than ever to finish the day's journey and he stopped the muleteer to enquire how far they had yet to go to the next post He replied Nine miles "I feel I am unable to proceed much further" said St Aubert "enquire as you go if there is any house on the road that would accommodate us for the night" He sunk back in the carriage and Michael cracking his whip in the air set off and continued  on the full gallop till St Aubert almost fainting called to him to stop Emily looked anxiously from the window and saw a peasant walking at some little distance on the road for whom they waited till he came up when he was asked if there was any house in the neighbourhood that accommodated travellers He replied that he knew of none "There is a chateau indeed among those woods on the right" added he "but I believe it receives nobody and I cannot shew you the way for I am almost a stranger here" St Aubert was going to ask him some further question concerning the chateau but the man abruptly passed on After some consideration he ordered Michael to proceed slowly to the woods Every moment now deepened the twilight and increased the difficulty of finding the road Another peasant soon after passed "Which is the way to the chateau in the woods" cried Michael  "The chateau in the woods" exclaimed  the peasant "Do you mean that with the turret yonder"  "I don't know as for the turret as you call it" said Michael "I mean that white piece of a building that we see at a distance there among the trees"  "Yes that is the turret why who are you that you are going thither" said the man with surprise  St Aubert on hearing this odd question and observing the peculiar tone in which it was delivered looked out from the carriage "We are travellers" said he "who are in search of a house of accommodation for the night is there any hereabout"  "None Monsieur unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder" replied the peasant pointing to the woods "but I would not advise you to go there"  "To whom does the chateau belong"  "I scarcely know myself Monsieur"  "It is uninhabited then" "No not uninhabited the steward and housekeeper are there I believe"  On hearing this St Aubert determined to proceed to the chateau and risque the refusal of being accommodated for the night he therefore desired the countryman would shew Michael the way and bade him expert reward for his trouble The man was for a moment silent and then said that he was going on other business but that the road could not be missed if they went up an avenue to the right to which he pointed St Aubert was going to speak but the peasant wished him good night and walked on  The carriage now moved towards the avenue which was guarded by a gate and Michael having dismounted to open it they entered between rows of antient oak and chesnut whose intermingled branches formed a lofty arch above There was something so gloomy and desolate in the appearance of this avenue and its lonely silence that Emily almost shuddered as she passed along and recollecting the manner in which the peasant had mentioned the  chateau she gave a mysterious meaning to his words such as she had not suspected when he uttered them These apprehensions however she tried to check considering that they were probably the effect of a melancholy imagination which her father's situation and a consederation of her own circumstances had made sensible to every impression  They passed slowly on for they were now almost in darkness which together with the unevenness of the ground and the frequent roots of old trees that shot up above the soil made it necessary to proceed with caution On a sudden Michael stopped the carriage and as St Aubert looked from the window to enquire the cause he perceived a figure at some distance moving up the avenue The dusk would not permit him to distinguish what it was but he bade Michael go on  "This seems a strange wild place" said Michael "there is no house hereabout  don't your honour think we had better turn back"  "Go a little further and if we see no house then we will return to the road" replied St Aubert  Michael proceeded with reluctance and the extreme slowness of his pace made St Aubert look again from the window to hasten him when again he saw the same figure He was somewhat startled probably the gloominess of the spot made him more liable to alarm than usual however this might be he now stopped Michael and bade him call to the person in the avenue  "Please your honour he may be a robber" said Michael "It does not please me" replied St Aubert who could not forbear smiling at the simplicity of his phrase "and we will therefore return to the road for I see no probability of meeting here with what we seek"  Michael turned about immediately and was retracing his way with alacrity when a voice was heard from among the trees on  the left It was not the voice of command or distress but a deep hollow tone which seemed to be scarcely human The man whipped his mules till they went as fast as possible regardless of the darkness the broken ground and the necks of the whole party nor once stopped till he reached the gate which opened from the avenue into the highroad where he went into a more moderate pace  "I am very ill" said St Aubert taking his daughter's hand "You are worse then sir" said Emily extremely alarmed by his manner "you are worse and here is no assistance Good God what is to be done" He leaned his head on her shoulder while she endeavoured to support him with her arm and Michael was again ordered to stop When the rattling of the wheels had ceased music was heard on the air it was to Emily the voice of Hope "Oh we are near some human habitation" said she "help may soon be had"  She listened anxiously the sounds were distant and seemed to come from a remote part of the woods that bordered the road and as she looked towards the spot whence they issued she perceived in the faint moonlight something like a chateau It was difficult however to reach this St Aubert was now too ill to bear the motion of the carriage Michael could not quit his mules and Emily who still supported her father feared to leave him and also feared to venture alone to such a distance she knew not whither or to whom Something however it was necessary to determine upon immediately St Aubert therefore told Michael to proceed slowly but they had not gone far when he fainted and the carriage was again stopped He lay quite senseless"My dear dear father" cried Emily in great agony and who began to fear that he was dying "speak if it is only one word to let me hear the sound of your voice" But no voice spoke in reply In an agony of terror she bade  Michael bring water from the rivulet that flowed along the road and having received some in the man's hat with trembling hands she sprinkled it over her father's face which as the moon's rays now fell upon it seemed to bear the impression of death Every emotion of selfish fear now gave way to a stronger influence and committing St Aubert to the care of Michael who refused to go far from his mules she stepped from the carriage in search of the chateau she had seen at a distance It was a still moonlight night and the music which yet sounded on the air directed her steps from the high road up a shadowy lane that led to the woods Her mind was for some time so entirely occupied by anxiety and terror for her father that she felt none for herself till the deepening gloom of the overhanging foliage which now wholly excluded the moonlight and the wildness of the place recalled her to a sense of her adventurous situation The music had ceased and she had no guide but chance For a moment  she paused in terrified perplexity till a sense of her father's condition again overcoming every consideration for herself she proceeded The lane terminated in the woods but she looked round in vain for a house or a human being and as vainly listened for a sound to guide her She hurried on however not knowing whither avoiding the recesses of the woods and endeavouring to keep along their margin till a rude kind of avenue which opened upon a moonlight spot arrested her attention The wildness of this avenue brought to her recollection the one leading to the turreted chateau and she was inclined to believe that this was a part of the same domain and probably led to the same point While she hesitated whether to follow it or not a sound of many voices in loud merriment burst upon her ear It seemed not the laugh of cheerfulness but of riot and she stood appalled While she paused she heard a distant voice calling from the way she had come and not doubting but it was that of Michael her first impulse  was to hasten back but a second thought changed her purpose she believed that nothing less than the last extremity could have prevailed with Michael to quit his mules and fearing that her father was now dying she rushed forward with a feeble hope of obtaining assistance from the people in the woods Her heart beat with fearful expectation as she drew near the spot whence the voices issued and she often startled when her steps disturbed the fallen leaves The sounds led her towards the moonlight glade she had before noticed at a little distance from which she stopped and saw between the boles of the trees a small circular level of green turf surrounded by the woods on which appeared a group of figures On drawing nearer she distinguished these by their dress to be peasants and perceived several cottages scattered round the edge of the woods which waved loftily over this spot While she gazed and endeavoured to overcome the apprehensions that withheld her steps several peasant girls came  out of a cottage music instantly struck up and the dance began It was the joyous music of the vintage the same she had before heard upon the air Her heart occupied with terror for her father could not feel the contrast which this gay scene offered to her own distress she stepped hastily forward towards a group of elder peasants who were seated at the door of a cottage and having explained her situation entreated their assistance Several of them rose with alacrity and offering any service in their power followed Emily who seemed to move on the wind as fast as they could towards the road  When she reached the carriage she found St Aubert restored to animation On the recovery of his senses having heard from Michael whither his daughter was gone anxiety for her overcame every regard for himself and he had sent him in search of her He was however still languid and perceiving himself unable to travel much further he renewed his enquiries for an  inn and concerning the chateau in the woods "The chateau cannot accommodate you sir" said a venerable peasant who had followed Emily from the woods "it is scarcely inhabited but if you will do me the honour to visit my cottage you shall be welcome to the best bed it affords"  St Aubert was himself a Frenchman he therefore was not surprised at French courtesy but ill as he was he felt the value of the offer enhanced by the manner which accompanied it He had too much delicacy to apologize or to appear to hesitate about availing himself of the peasant's hospitality but immediately accepted it with the same frankness with which it was offered  The carriage again moved slowly on Michael following the peasants up the lane which Emily had just quitted till they came to the moon light glade St Aubert's spirits were so far restored by the courtesy of his host and the near prospect of repose that he looked with a sweet complacency upon  the moonlight scene surrounded by the shadowy woods through which here and there an opening admitted the streaming splendour discovering a cottage or a sparkling rivulet He listened with no painful emotion to the merry notes of the guitar and tamborine and though tears came to his eyes when he saw the  debonnaire  dance of the peasants they were not merely tears of mournful regret With Emily it was otherwise immediate terror for her father had now subsided into a gentle melancholy which every note of joy by awakening comparison served to heighten  The dance ceased on the approach of the carriage which was a phenomenon in these sequestered woods and the peasantry flocked round it with eager curiosity On learning that it brought a sick stranger several girls ran across the turf and returned with wine and baskets of grapes which they presented to the travellers each with kind contention pressing for a preference At length the carriage stopped at a neat cottage and  his venerable conductor having assisled St Aubert to alight led him and Emily to a small inner room illumined only by moonbeams which the open casement admitted St Aubert rejoicing in rest seated himself in an armchair and his senses were refreshed by the cool and balmy air that lightly waved the embowering honeysuckles and wafted their sweet breath into the apartment His host who was called La Voisin quitted the room but soon returned with fruits cream and all the pastoral luxury his cottage afforded having set down which with a smile of unfeigned welcome he retired behind the chair of his guest St Aubert insisted on his taking a seat at the table and when the fruit had allayed the fever of his palate and he found himself somewhat revived he began to converse with his host who communicated several particulars concerning himself and his family which were interesting because they were spoken from the heart and delineated a picture of the sweet courtesies  of family kindness Emily sat by her father holding his hand and while she listened to the old man her heart swelled with the affectionate sympathy he described and her tears fell to the mournful consideration that death would probably soon deprive her of the dearest blessing she then possessed The soft moonlight of an autumnal evening and the distant music which now sounded a plaintive strain aided the melancholy of her mind The old man continued to talk of his family and St Aubert remained silent "I have only one daughter living" said La Voisin "but she is happily married and is every thing to me When I lost my wife" he added with a sigh "I came to live with Agnes and her family she has several children who are all dancing on the green yonder as merry as grasshoppersand long may they be so I hope to die among them monsieur I am old now and cannot expect to live long but there is some comfort in dying surrounded by one's children"  "My good friend" said St Aubert while his voice trembled "I hope you will long live surrounded by them"  "Ah sir at my age I must not expect that" replied the old man and he paused "I can scarcely wish it" he resumed "for I trust that whenever I die I shall go to heaven where my poor wife is gone before me I can sometimes almost fancy I see her of a still moonlight night walking among these shades she loved so well Do you believe monsieur that we shall be permitted to revisit the earth after we have quitted the body"  Emily could no longer stifle the anguish of her heart her tears fell fast upon her father's hand which she yet held He made an effort to speak and at length said in a low voice "I hope we shall be permitted to look down on those we have left on the earth but I can only hope it Futurity is much veiled from our eyes and faith and hope are our only guides concerning it We are not enjoined to believe that  disembodied spirits watch over the friends they have loved but we may innocently hope it It is a hope which I will never resign" continued he while he wiped the tears from his daughter's eyes "it will sweeten the bitter moments of death" Tears fell slowly on his cheeks La Voisin wept too and there was a pause of silence Then La Voisin renewing the subject said "But you believe sir that we shall meet in another world the relations we have loved in this I must believe this" "Then do believe it" replied St Aubert "severe indeed would be the pangs of separation if we believed it to be eternal Look up my dear Emily we shall meet again" He lifted his eyes towards heaven and a gleam of moonlight which fell upon his countenance discovered peace and resignation stealing on the lines of sorrow  La Voisin felt that he had pursued the subject too far and he dropped it saying "We are in darkness I forgot to bring a light"  "No" said St Aubert "this is a light  I love Sit down my good friend Emily my love I find myself better than I have been all day this air refreshes me I can enjoy this tranquil hour and that music which floats so sweetly at a distance Let me see you smile "Who touches that guitar so tastefully are there two instruments or is it an echo I hear"  "It is an echo monsieur I fancy That guitar is often heard at night when all is still but nobody knows who touches it and it is sometimes accompanied by a voice so sweet and so sad one would almost think the woods were haunted" "They certainly are haunted" said St Aubert with a smile "but I believe it is by mortals" "I have sometimes heard it at midnight when I could not sleep" rejoined La Voisin not seeming to notice this remark "almost under my window and I never heard any music like it It has often made me think of my poor wife till I cried I have sometimes got up to the window to look if I could see any body but  as soon as I opened the casement all was hushed and nobody to be seen and I have listened and listened till I have been so timorous that even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made me start They say it often comes to warn people of their death but I have heard it these many years and outlived the warning"  Emily though she smiled at the mention of this ridiculous superstition could not in the present tone of her spirits wholly resist its contagion  "Well but my good friend" said St Aubert "has nobody had courage to follow the sounds If they had they would probably have discovered who is the musician" "Yes sir they have followed them some way into the woods but the music has still retreated and seemed as distant as ever and the people have at last been afraid of being led into harm and would go no further It is very seldom that I have heard these sounds so early in the evening They usually come about midnight when that bright planet  which is rising above the turret yonder sets below the woods on the left"  "What turret" asked St Aubert with quickness "I see none"  "Your pardon monsieur you do see one indeed for the moon shines full upon itup the avenue yonder a long way off the chateau it belongs to is hid among the trees"  "Yes my dear sir" said Emily pointing "don't you see something glitter above the dark woods It is a fane I fancy which the rays fall upon"  "O yes I see what you mean and who does the chateau belong to"  "The Marquis de Villeroi was its owner" replied La Voisin emphatically  "Ah" said St Aubert with a deep sigh "are we then so near LeBlanc" He appeared much agitated  "It used to be the Marquis's favourite residence" resumed La Voisin "but he took a dislike to the place and has not been there for many years We have heard  lately that he is dead and that it is fallen into other hands" St Aubert who had sat in deep musing was roused by the last words "Dead" he exclaimed "Good God when did he die"  "He is reported to have died about five weeks since" replied La Voisin "Did you know the Marquis sir"  "This is very extraordinary" said St Aubert without attending to the question "Why is it so my dear sir" said Emily in a voice" of timid curiosity He made no reply but sunk again into a reverie and in a few moments when he seemed to have recovered himself asked who had succeeded to the estates "I have forgot his title monsieur" said La Voisin "but my lord resides at Paris chiefly I hear no talk of his coming hither"  "The chateau is shut up then still"  "Why little better sir the old housekeeper and her husband the steward have the care of it but they live generally in a cottage hard by"  "The chateau is spacious I suppose" said Emily "and must be desolate for the tesidence of only two persons"  Desolate enough mademoiselle" replied La Voisin "I would not pass one night in the chateau for the value of the whole domain"  "What is that" said St Aubert roused again from thoughtfulness As his host repeated his last sentence a groan escaped from St Aubert and then as if anxious to prevent it from being noticed he hastily asked La Voisin how long he had lived in this neighbourhood "Almost from my childhood sir" replied his host  "You remember the late marchioness then" said St Aubert in an altered voice  "Ah monsieurthat I do well There are many beside me who remember her"  "Yes" said St Aubert "and I am one of those"  "Alas sir you remember then a most beautiful and excellent lady She deserved a better fate"  Tears stood in St Aubert's eyes "Enough" said he in a voice almost stifled by the violence of his emotions"it is enough my friend"  Emily though extremely surprised by her father's manner forbore to express her feelings by any question La Voisin began to apologize but St Aubert interrupted him "Apology is quite unnecessary" said he "let us change the topic You was speaking of the music we just now heard"  "I was monsieurbut harkit comes again listen to that voice" They were all silent  At last a soft and solemnbreathing sound  Rose like a stream of rich distilled persumes  And stole upon the air that even Silence  Was took ere she was 'ware and wished she might  Deny her nature and be never more  Still to be so displaced  MILTON    In a few moments the voice died into air and the instrument which had been heard  before sounded in low symphony St Aubert now observed that it produced a tone much more full and melodious than that of a guitar and still more melancholy and soft than the lute They continued to listen but the sounds returned no more "This is strange" said St Aubert at length interrupting the silence "Very strange" said Emily "It is so" rejoined La Voisin and they were again silent  After a long pause "It is now about eighteen years since I first heard that music" said La Voisin "I remember it was on a fine summer's night much like this but later that I was walking in the woods and alone I remember too that my spirits were very low for one of my boys was ill and we feared we mould lose him I had been watching at his bedside all the evening while his mother slept for she had sat up with him the night before I had been watching and went out for a little fresh air the day had been very sultry As I walked under the shades and mused I heard music  at a distance and thought it was Claude playing upon his flute as he often did of a fine evening at the cottage door But when I came to a place where the trees opened I shall never forget it and stood looking up at the northlights which shot up the heaven to a great height I heard all of a sudden such soundsthey came so as I cannot describe It was like the music of angels and I looked up again almost expecting to see them in the sky When I came home I told what I had heard but they laughed at me and said it must be some of the shepherds playing on their pipes and I could not persuade them to the contrary A few nights after however my wife herself heard the same sounds and was as much surprised as I was and father Denis frightened her sadly by saying that it was music come to warn her of her child's death and that music often came to houses where there was a dying person"  Emily on hearing this shrunk with a superstitious dread entirely new to her and  could scarcely conceal her agitation from St Aubert  "But the boy lived monsieur in spite of father Denis"  "Father Denis" said St Aubert who had listened to "narrative old age" with patient attention "are we near a convent then"  "Yes sir the convent of St Clair stands at no great distance on the sea shore yonder"  "Ah" said St Aubert as if struck with some sudden remembrance "the convent of St Clair" Emily observed the clouds of grief mingled with a faint expression of horror gathering on his brow his countenance became fixed and touched as it now was by the silver whiteness of the moon light he resembled one of those marble statues of a monument which seem to bend in hopeless sorrow over the ashes of the dead shewn  by the blunted light  That the dim moon through painted casements lends  The Emigrants    "But my dear sir" said Emily anxious to dissipate his thoughts "you forget that repose is necessary to you If our kind host will give me leave I will prepare your bed for I know how you like it to be made" St Aubert recollecting himself and smiling affectionately desired she would not add to her fatigue by that attention and La Voisin whose consideration for his guest had been suspended by the interests which his own narrative had recalled now started from his seat and apologizing for not having called Agnes from the green hurried out of the room  In a few moments he returned with his daughter a young woman of a pleasing countenance and Emily learned from her what she had not before suspected that for their accommodation it was necessary part of La Voisin's family should leave their beds she lamented this circumstance but Agnes by her reply fully proved that she inherited at least a share of her father's courteous hospitality It was settled that  some of her children and Michael should sleep in the neighbouring cottage  "If I am better tomorrow my dear" said St Aubert when Emily returned to him "I mean to set out at an early hour that we may rest during the heat of the day and will travel towards home In the present state of my health and spirits I cannot look on a longer journey with pleasure and I am also very anxious to reach La Vallée" Emily though she also desired to return was grieved at her father's sudden wish to do so which she thought indicated a greater degree of indisposition than he would acknowledge St Aubert now retired to rest and Emily to her little chamber but not to immediate repose Her thoughts returned to the late conversation concerning the state of departed spirits a subject at this time particularly affecting to her when she had every reason to believe that her dear father would ere long be numbered with them She leaned pensively on the little open casement and in deep thought  fixed her eyes on the heaven whose blue unclouded concave was studded thick with stars the worlds perhaps of spirits unsphered of mortal mould As her eyes wandered along the boundless aether her thoughts rose as before towards the sublimity of the Deity and to the contemplation of futurity No busy note of this world interrupted the course of her mind the merry dance had ceased and every cottager had retired to his home The still air seemed scarcely to breathe upon the woods and now and then the distant sound of a solitary sheepbell or of a closing casement was all that broke on silence At length even this hint of human being was heard no more Elevated and enwrapt while her eyes were often wet with tears of sublime devotion and solemn awe she continued at the casement till the gloom of midnight hung over the earth and the planet which La Voisin had pointed out sunk below the woods She then recollected what he had said concerning this planet and the mysterious  music and as she lingered at the window half hoping and half fearing that it would return her mind was led to the remembrance of the extreme emotion her father had shewn on mention of the Marquis La Villeroi's death and of the fate of the Marchioness and she felt strongly interested concerning the remote cause of this emotion Her surprise and curiosity were indeed the greater because she did not recollect ever to have heard him mention the name of Villeroi  No music however stole on the silence of the night and Emily perceiving the lateness of the hour returned to a scene of fatigue remembered that she was to rise early in the morning and withdrew from the window to repose  CHAP VII  Let those deplore their doom  Whose hope still grovels in this dark sojourn  But losty souls can look beyond the tomb  Can smile at fate and wonder how they mourn  Shall Spring to these sad scenes no more return  Is yonder wave the sun's eternal bed  Soon shall the orient with new lustre burn  And Spring shall soon her vital influence shed  Again attune the grove again adorn the mead  BEATTIE  EMILY called as she had requested at an early hour awoke little refreshed by sleep for uneasy dreams had pursued her and marred the kindest blessing of the unhappy But when she opened her casement looked out upon the woods bright with the morning sun and inspired the pure air her mind was soothed The scene was filled with that cheering freshness which seems to breathe the very spirit of health and she heard only sweet and  picturesque  sounds if such an  expression may be allowedthe matinbell of a distant convent the faint murmur of the seawaves the song of birds and the faroff low of cattle which she saw coming slowly on between the trunks of the trees Struck with the circumstances of imagery around her she indulged the pensive tranquillity which they inspired and while she leaned on her window waiting till St Aubert should descend to breakfast her ideas arranged themselves in the following lines  THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING  How sweet to wind the forest's tangled shade  When early twilight from the eastern bound  Dawns on the sleeping landscape in the glade  And fades as morning spreads her blush around  When ev'ry infant flower that wept in night  Lifts its chill head soft glowing with a tear  Expands its tender blossom to the light  And gives its incense to the genial air  How fresh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume  And swells the melody of waking birds  The hum of bees beneath the verdant gloom  And woodman's song and low of distant herds  Then doubtful gleams the mountain's hoary head  Seen through the parting foliage from afar  And farther still the ocean's misty bed  With flitting fails that partial sunbeams share  But vain the sylvan shadethe breath of May  The voice of music floating on the gale  And forms that beam through morning's dewy veil  If health no longer bid the heart be gay  O balmy hour 'tis thine her wealth to give  Here spread her blush and bid the parent live  Emily now heard persons moving below in the cottage and presently the voice of Michael who was talking to his mules as he led them forth from a hut adjoining As she left her room St Aubert who was now risen met her at the door apparently as little restored by sleep as herself She led him down stairs to the little parlour in which they had supped on the preceding night where they found a neat breakfast set out while the host and his daughter waited to bid them good morrow  "I envy you this cottage my good friends" said St Aubert as he met them  "it is so pleasant so quiet and so neat and this air that one breathesif any thing could restore lost health it would surely be this air"  La Voisin bowed gratefully and replied with the gallantry of a Frenchman "Our cottage may be envied sir since you and Mademoiselle have honoured it with your presence" St Aubert gave him a friendly smile for his compliment and sat down to a table spread with cream fruit new cheese butter and coffee Emily who had observed her father with attention and thought he looked very ill endeavoured to persuade him to defer travelling till the afternoon but he seemed very anxious to be at home and his anxiety he expressed repeatedly and with an earnestness that was unusual with him He now said he found himself as well as he had been of late and that he could bear travelling better in the cool hour of the morning than at any other time But while he was talking with his venerable host and thanking him for his kind attentions Emily observed his countenance  change and before she could reach him he fell back in his chair In a few moments he recovered from the sudden faintness that had come over him but felt so ill that he perceived himself unable to set out and having remained a little while struggling against the pressure of indisposition he begged he might be helped up stairs to bed This request renewed all the terror which Emily had suffered on the preceding evening but though scarcely able to support herself under the sudden shock it gave her she tried to conceal her apprehensions from St Aubert and gave her trembling arm to assist him to the door of his chamber  When he was once more in bed he desired that Emily who was then weeping in her own room might be called and as she came he waved his hand for every other person to quit the apartment When they were alone he held out his hand to her and fixed his eyes upon her countenance with an expression so full of tenderness and grief that all her fortitude forsook  her and she burst into an agony of tears St Aubert seemed struggling to acquire firmness but was still unable to speak he could only press her hand and check the tears that stood trembling in his eyes At length he commanded his voice "My dear child" said he trying to smile through his anguish "my dear Emily"and paused again He raised his eyes to heaven as if in prayer and then in a firmer tone and with a look in which the tenderness of the father was dignified by the pious solemnity of the saint he said "My dear child I would soften the painful truth I have to tell you but I find myself quite unequal to the art Alas I would at this moment conceal it from you but that it would be most cruel to deceive you It cannot be long before we must part let us talk of it that our thoughts and our prayers may prepare us to bear it" His voice faltered while Emily still weeping pressed his hand close to her heart which swelled with a convulsive sigh but she could not look up  "Let me not waste these moments" said St Aubert recovering himself "I have much to say There is a circumstance of solemn consequence which I have to mention and a solemn promise to obtain from you when this is done I shall be easier You have observed my dear how anxious I am to reach home but know not all my reasons for this Listen to what I am going to sayYet staybefore I say more give me this promise a promise made to your dying father"St Aubert was interrupted Emily struck by his last words as if for the first time with a conviction of his immediate danger raised her head her tears stopped and gazing at him for a moment with an expression of unutterable anguish a slight convulsion seized her and she sunk senseless in her chair St Aubert's cries brought La Voisin and his daughter to the room and they administered every means in their power to restore her but for a considerable time without effect When she recovered St Aubert was so exhausted by the scene he had witnessed that it was  many minutes before he had strength to speak he was however somewhat revived by a cordial which Emily gave him and being again alone with her he exerted himself to tranquillize her spirits and to offer her all the comfort of which her situation admitted She threw herself into his arms wept on his neck and grief made her so insensible to all he said that he ceased to offer the alleviations which he himself could not at this moment feel and mingled his silent tears with hers Recalled at length to a sense of duty she tried to spare her father from farther view of her suffering and quitting his embrace dried her tears and said something which she meant for consolation "My dear Emily" replied St Aubert "my dear child we must look up with humble confidence to that Being who has protected and comforted us in every danger and in every affliction we have known to whose eye every moment of our lives has been exposed he will not he does not forsake us now I feel his consolations in my heart I shall leave you my child  still in his care and though I depart from this world I shall be still in his presence Nay weep not again my Emily In death there is nothing new or surprising since we all know that we are born to die and nothing terrible to those who can conside in an allpowerful God Had my life been spared now after a very few years in the course of nature I must have resigned it old age with all its train of infirmity its privations and its sorrows would have been mine and then at last death would have come and called forth the tears you now shed Rather my child rejoice that I am saved from such suffering and that I am permitted to die with a mind unimpaired and sensible of the comforts of faith and of resignation" St Aubert paused fatigued with speaking Emily again endeavoured to assume an air of composure and in replying to what he had said tried to sooth him with a belief that he had not spoken in vain  When he had reposed a while he resumed the conversation "Let me return" said he "to a subject which is very near my heart I said I had a solemn promise to receive from you let me receive it now before I explain the chief circumstance which it concerns there are others of which your peace requires that you should rest in ignorance Promise then that you will perform exactly what I shall enjoin"  Emily awed by the earnest solemnity of his manner dried her tears that had begun again to flow in spite of her efforts to suppress them and looking eloquently at St Aubert bound herself to do whatever he should require by a vow at which she shuddered yet knew not why  He proceeded "I know you too well my Emily to believe that you would break any promise much less one thus solemnly given your assurance gives me peace and the observance of it is of the utmost importance to your tranquillity Hear then what I am going to tell you The closet  which adjoins my chamber at La Vallée has a sliding board in the floor You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood and by its being the next board except one to the wainscot which fronts the door At the distance of about a yard from that end nearer the window you will perceive a line across it as if the plank had been joinedthe way to open it is thisPress your foot upon the line the end of the board will then sink and you may slide it with ease beneath the other Below you will see a hollow place" St Aubert paused for breath and Emily sat fixed in deep attention "Do you understand these directions my dear" said he Emily though scarcely able to speak assured him that she did  "When you return home then" he added with a deep sigh  At the mention of her return home all the melancholy circumstances that must attend this return rushed upon her fancy she burst into convulsive grief and St Aubert  himself affected beyond the resistance of the fortitude which he had at first summoned wept with her After some moments he composed himself "My dear child" said he "be comforted "When I am gone you will not be forsakenI leave you only in the more immediate care of that Providence which has never yet forsaken me Do not afflict me with this excess of grief rather teach me by your example to bear my own" He stopped again and Emily the more she endeavoured to restrain her emotion found it the less possible to do so  St Aubert who now spoke with pain resumed the subject "That closet my dearwhen you return home go to it and beneath the board I have described you will find a packet of written papers Attend to me now for the promise you have given particularly relates to what I shall direct These papers you must burnand solemnly I command you  without examining them  "  Emily's surprise for a moment overcame her grief and she ventured to ask why this must be St Aubert replied that if it had been right for him to explain his reasons her late promise would have been unnecessarily exacted It is sufficient for you my love to have a deep sense of the importance of observing me in this instance" Sr Aubert proceeded "Under that board you will also find about two hundred louis d'ors wrapped in a silk purse indeed it was to secure whatever money might be in the chateau that this secret place was contrived at a time when the province was overrun by troops of men who took advantage of the tumults and became plunderers  "But I have yet another promise to receive froms you which isthat you will never whatever may be your future circumstances  sell  the chateau" St Aubert even enjoined her whenever she might marry to make it an article in the contract that the chateau should always be hers  He then gave her a more minute account of his present circumstances than he had yet done adding "The two hundred louis with what money you will now find in my purse is all the ready money I have to leave you I have told you how I am circumstanced with M Motteville at Paris Ah my child I leave you poorbut not destitute" he added after a long pause Emily could make no reply to any thing he now said but knelt at the bedside with her face upon the quilt weeping over the hand she held there  After this conversation the mind of St Aubert appeared to be much more at ease but exhausted by the effort of speaking he sunk into a kind of doze and Emily continued to watch and weep beside him till a gentle tap at the chamberdoor roused her It was La Voisin come to say that a confessor from the neighbouring convent was below ready to attend St Aubert Emily would not suffer her father to be disturbed but desired that the priest might hot leave  the cottage When St Aubert awoke from this doze his senses were confused and it was some moments before he recovered them sufficiently to know that it was Emily who sat beside him He then moved his lips and stretched forth his hand to her as she received which she sunk back in her chair overcome by the impression of death on his countenance In a few minutes he recovered his voice and Emily then asked if he wished to see the confessor he replied that he did and when the holy father appeared she withdrew They remained alone together above half an hour when Emily was called in she found St Aubert more agitated than when she had left him and she gazed with a slight degree of resentment at the friar as the cause of this who however looked mildly and mournfully at her and turned away St Aubert in a tremulous voice said he wished her to join in prayer with him and asked if La Voisin would do so too The old man and his daughter came they both  wept and knelt with Emily round the bed while the holy father read in a solemn voice the service for the dying St Aubert lay with a serene countenance and seemed to join fervently in the devotion while tears often stole from beneath his closed eyelids and Emily's sobs more than once interrupted the service  When it was concluded and extreme unction had been administered the friar withdrew St Aubert then made a sign for La Voisin to come nearer He gave him his hand and was for a moment silent At length he said in a trembling voice "My good friend our acquaintance has been short but long enough to give you an opportunity of shewing me much kind attention I cannot doubt that you will extend this kindness to my daughter when I am gone she will have need of it I entrust her to your care during the few days she will remain here I need say no moreyou know the feelings of a father for you have children mine would be indeed  deed severe if I had less confidence in you" He paused La Voisin assured him and his tears bore testimony to his sincerity that he would do all he could to soften her affliction and that if St Aubert wished it he would even attend her into Gascony an offer so pleasing to St Aubert that he had scarcely words to acknowledge his sense of the old man's kindness or to tell him that he accepted it The scene that followed between St Aubert and Emily affected La Voisin so much that he quitted the chamber and she was again left alone with her father whose spirits seemed fainting fast but neither his senses or his voice yet failed him and at intervals he employed much of these last awful moments in advising his daughter as to her future conduct Perhaps he never had thought more justly or expressed himself more clearly than he did now  "Above all my dear Emily" said he "do not indulge in the pride of fine feeling the romantic error of amiable minds Those  who really possess sensibility ought early to be taught that it is a dangerous quality which is continually extracting the excess of misery or delight from every surrounding circumstance And since in our passage through this world painful circumstances occur more frequently than pleasing ones and since our sense of evil is I fear more acute than our sense of good we become the victims of our feelings unless we can in some degree command them I know you will say for you are young my Emily I know you will say that you are contented sometimes to suffer rather than to give up your refined sense of happiness at others but when your mind has been long harassed by vicissitude you will be content to rest and you will then recover from your delusion You will perceive that the phantom of happiness is exchanged for the substance for happiness arises in a state of peace not of tumult It is of a temperate and uniform nature and can no more exist in a heart that is continually alive to minute  circumstances than in one that is dead to feeling You see my dear that though I would guard you against the dangers of sensibility I am not an advocate for apathy At your age I should have said  that  is a vice more hateful than all the errors of sensibility and I say so still I call it a  vice  because it leads to positive evil in this however it does no more than an illgoverned sensibility which by such a rule might also be called a vice but the evil of the former is of more general consequence I have exhausted myself" said St Aubert feebly "and have wearied you my Emily but on a subject so important to your future comfort I am anxious to be perfectly understood"  Emily assured him that his advice was most precious to her and that she would never forget it or cease from endeavouring to profit by it St Aubert smiled affectionately and sorrowfully upon her "I repeat it" said he "I would not teach you to become insensible if I could I would  only warn you of the evils of susceptibility and point out how you may avoid them Beware my love I conjure you of that selfdelusion which has been fatal to the peace of so many persons beware of priding yourself on the gracefulness of sensibility if you yield to this vanity your happiness is lost for ever Always remember how much more valuable is the strength of fortitude than the grace of sensibility Do not however confound fortitude with apathy apathy cannot know the virtue Remember too that one act of beneficence one act of real usefulness is worth all the abstract sentiment in the world Sentiment is a disgrace instead of an ornament unless it lead us to good actions The miser who thinks himself respectable merely because he possesses wealth and thus mistakes the means of doing good for the actual accomplishment of it is not more blameable than the man of sentiment without active virtue You may have observed persons who delight so much in this sort of sensibility  to sentiment which excludes that to the calls of any practical virtue that they turn from the distressed and because their sufferings are painful to be contemplated do not endeavour to relieve them How despicable is that humanity which can be contented to pity where it might assuage"  St Aubert some time after spoke of Madame Cheron his sister "Let me inform you of a circumstance that nearly affects your welfare" he added "We have you know had little intercourse for some years but as she is now your only female relation I have thought it proper to consign you to her care as you will see in my will till yon are of age and to recommend you to her protection afterwards She is not exactly the person to whom I would have committed my Emily but I had no alternative and I believe her to be upon the wholea good kind of woman I need not recommend it to your prudence my love to endeavour to conciliate her  kindness you will do this for his sake who has often wished to do so for yours"  Emily assured him that whatever he requested she would religiously perform to the utmost of her ability "Alas" added she in a voice interrupted by sighs "that will soon be all which remains for me it will be almost my only consolation to fulfil your wishes"  St Aubert looked up silently in her face as if he would have spoken but his spirit sunk a while and his eyes became heavy and dull She felt that look at her heart "My dear father" she exclaimed and then checking herself pressed his hand closer and hid her face with her handkerchief Her tears were concealed but St Aubert heard her convulsive sobs His spirits returned "O my child" said he faintly "let my consolations be yours I die in peace for I know that I am about to return to the bosom of my Father who will still be your Father when I am gone  Always trust in him my love and he will support you in these moments as he supports me"  Emily could only listen and weep but the extreme composure of his manner and the faith and hope he expressed somewhat soothed her anguish Yet whenever she looked upon his emaciated countenance and saw the lines of death beginning to prevail over itsaw his sunk eyes still bent on her and their heavy lids pressing to a close there was a pang in her heart such as defied expression though it required filial virtue like hers to forbear the attempt  He desired once more to bless her "Where are you my dear" said he as he stretched forth his hands Emily had turned to the window that he might not perceive her anguish she now understood that his sight had failed him When he had given her his blessing and it seemed to be the last effort of expiring life he sunk back on his pillow She kissed his forehead the damps of death had settled there  and forgetting her fortitude for a moment her tears mingled with them St Aubert lifted up his eyes the spirit of a father returned to them but it quickly vanished and he spoke no more  St Aubert lingered till about three o'clock in the afternoon and thus gradually sinking into death he expired without a struggle or a sigh  Emily was led from the chamber by La Voisin and his daughter who did what they could to comfort her The old man sat and wept with her Agnes was more erroneously officious  CHAP IX  O'er him whose doom thy virtues grieve  Aerial forms shall sit at eve  And bend the pensive head  COLLINS  THE monk who had before appeared returned in the evening to offer consolation to Emily and brought a kind message from the lady abbess inviting her to the convent Emily though she did not accept the offer returned an answer expressive of her gratitude The holy conversation of the friar whose mild benevolence of manners bore some resemblance to those of St Aubert soothed the violence of her grief and lifted her heart to the Being who extending through all place and all eternity looks on the events of this little world as on the shadows of a moment and beholds equally and in the same instant the soul  that has passed the gates of death and that which still lingers in the body "In the sight of God" said Emily "my dear father now exists as truly as he yesterday existed to me it is to me only that he is dead to God and to himself he yet lives"  The good monk left her more tranquil than she had been since St Aubert died and before she retired to her little cabin for the night she trusted herself so far as to visit the corpse Silent and without weeping she stood by its side The features placid and serene told the nature of the last sensations that had lingered in the now deserted frame For a moment she turned away in horror of the stillness in which death had fixed that countenance never till now seen otherwise than animated then gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and awful astonishment Her reason could scarcely overcome an involuntary and unaccountable expectation of seeing that beloved countenance still susceptible She continued to gaze wildly took up the cold  hand spoke still gazed and then burst into a transport of grief La Voisin hearing her sobs came into the room to lead her away but she heard nothing and only begged that he would leave her  Again alone she indulged her tears and when the gloom of evening obscured the chamber and almost veiled from her eyes the object of her distress she still hung over the body till her spirits at length were exhausted and she became tranquil La Voisin again knocked at the door and entreated that she would come to the common apartment Before she went she kissed the lips of St Aubert as she was wont to do when she bade him good night Again she kissed them her heart felt as if it would break a few tears of agony started to her eyes she looked up to heaven then at St Aubert and left the room  Retired to her lonely cabin her melancholy thoughts still hovered round the body of her deceased parent and when she sunk into a kind of slumber the images of her  waking mind still haunted her fancy She thought she saw her father approaching her with a benign countenance then smiling mournfully and pointing upwards his lips moved but instead of words she heard sweet music borne on the distant air and presently saw his features glow with the mild rapture of a superior being The strain seemed to swell louder and she awoke The vision was gone but music yet came to her ear in strains such as angels might breathe She doubted listened raised herself in the bed and again listened It was music and not an illusion of her imagination After a solemn steady harmony it paused then rose again in mournful sweetness and then died in a cadence that seemed to bear away the listening soul to heaven She instantly remembered the music of the preceding night with the strange circumstances related by La Voisin and the affecting conversation it had led to concerning the state of departed spirits All that St Aubert had said on that subject now pressed  upon her heart and overwhelmed it What a change in a few hours He who then could only conjecture was now made acquainted with truth was himself become one of the departed As the listened she was chilled with superstitious awe her tears stopped and she rose and went to the window All without was obscured in shade but Emily turning her eyes from the massy darkness of the woods whose waving outline appeared on the horizon saw on the left that effulgent planet which the old man had pointed out setting over the woods She remembered what he had said concerning it and the music now coming at intervals on the air she unclosed the casement to listen to the strains that soon gradually sunk to a greater distance and tried to discover whence they came The obscurity prevented her from distinguishing any object on the green platform below and the sounds became fainter and fainter till they softened into silence She listened but they returned no more Soon after she observed  the planet trembling between the fringed tops of the woods and in the next moment sink behind them Chilled with a melancholy awe she retired once more to her bed and at length forgot for a while her sorrows in sleep  On the following morning she was visited by a sister of the convent who came with kind offices and a second invitation from the lady abbess and Emily though she could not forsake the cottage while the remains of her father were in it consented however painful such a visit must be in the present state of her spirits to pay her respects to the abbess in the evening  About an hour before sunset La Voisin shewed her the way through the woods to the convent which stood in a small bay of the Mediterranean crowned by a woody amphitheatre and Emily had she been less unhappy would have admired the extensive sea view that appeared from the green slope in front of the edifice and the rich shores hung with woods and pastures that extended  on either hand But her thoughts were now occupied by one sad idea and the features of nature were to her colourless and without form The bell for vespers struck as she passed the ancient gate of the convent and seemed the funereal note for St Aubert Little incidents affect a mind enervated by sorrow Emily struggled against the sickening faintness that came over her and was led into the presence of the abbess who received her with an air of maternal tenderness an air of such gentle solicitude and consideration as touched her with an instantaneous gratitude her eyes were filled with tears and the words she' would have spoken faltered on her lips The abbess led her to a seat and sat down beside her still holding her hand and regarding her in silence as Emily dried her tears and attempted to speak "Be composed my daughter" said the abbess in a soothing voice "do not speak yet I know all you would say Your spirits must be soothed We are going to prayerswill you attend  our evening service It is comfortable my child to look up in our afflictions to a father who sees and pities us and who chastens in his mercy"  Emily's tears flowed again but a thousand sweet emotions mingled with them The abbess suffered her to weep without interruption and watched over her with a look of benignity that might have characterized the countenance of a guardian angel Emily when she became tranquil was encouraged to speak without reserve and to mention the motive that made her unwilling to quit the cottage which the abbess did not oppose even by a hint but praised the filial piety of her conduct and added a hope that she would pass a few days at the convent before she returned to La Vallée "You must allow yourself a little time to recover from your first shock my daughter before you encounter a second I will not affect to conceal from you how much I know your heart must suffer on returning to the scene of your former happiness Here you  will have all that quiet and sympathy and religion can give to restore your spirits But come" added she observing the tears swell in Emily's eyes "we will go to the chapel"  Emily followed to the parlour where the nuns were assembled to whom the abbess committed her saying "This is a daughter for whom I have much esteem be sisters to her"  They passed on in a train to the chapel where the solemn devotion with which the service was performed elevated her mind and brought to it the comforts of faith and resignation  Twilight came on before the abbess's kindness would suffer Emily to depart when she left the convent with a heart much lighter than she had entered it and was reconducted by La Voisin through the woods the pensive gloom of which was in unison with the temper of her mind and she pursued the little wild path in musing silence till her guide suddenly stopped looked round and then struck out of the path into  the high grass saying he had mistaken the road He now walked on quickly and Emily proceeding with difficulty over the obscured and uneven ground was left at some distance till her voice arrested him who seemed unwilling to stop and still hurried on "If you are in doubt about the way" said Emily "had we not better enquire it at the chateau yonder between the trees"  "No" replied La Voisin "there is no occasion When we reach that brook ma'amselle you see the light upon the water there beyond the woods when we reach that brook we shall be at home presently I don't know how I happened to mistake the path I seldom come this way after sunset"  "It is solitary enough" said Emily "but you have no banditti here" "No ma' amselleno banditti"  "What are you afraid of then my good friend you are not superstitious" "No not superstitious but to tell you the truth  lady nobody likes to go near that chateau after dusk" "By whom is it inhabited" said Emily "that it is so formidable" "Why ma'amselle it is scarcely inhabited for our lord the Marquis and the lord of all these fine woods too is dead He had not once been in it for these many years and his people who have the care of it live in a cottage close by" Emily now understood this to be the chateau which La Voisin had formerly pointed out as having belonged to the Marquis Villeroi on the mention of which her father had appeared so much affected  "Ah it is a desolate place now" continued La Voisin "and such a grand fine place as I remember it" Emily enquired what had occasioned this lamentable change but the old man was silent and Emily whose interest was awakened by the fear he had expressed and above all by a recollection of her father's agitation repeated the question and added "If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants my good friend  nor are superstitious how happens it that you dread to pass near that chateau in the dark"  "Perhaps then I am a little superstitious ma'amselle and if you knew what I do you might be so too Strange things have happened there Monsieur your good father appeared to have known the late Marchioness" "Pray inform me what did happen" said Emily with much emotion  "Alas ma'amselle" answered La Voisin "enquire no further it is not for me to lay open the domestic secrets of my lord"Emily surprised by the old man's words and his manner of delivering them forbore to repeat her question a nearer interest the remembrance of St Aubert occupied her thoughts and she was led to recollect the music she heard on the preceding night which she mentioned to La Voisin "You was not alone ma'amselle in this" he replied "I heard it too but I have so often heard it at the same hour that I was scarcely surprised"  "You doubtless believe this music to have some connection with the chateau" said Emily suddenly" and are therefore superstitious" "It may be so ma'amselle but there are other circumstances belonging to that chateau which I remember and sadly too" A heavy sigh followed but Emily's delicacy restrained the curiosity these words revived and she enquired no further  On reaching the cottage all the violence of her grief returned it seemed as if she had escaped its heavy pressure only while she was removed from the object of it She passed immediately to the chamber where the remains of her father were laid and yielded to all the anguish of hopeless grief La Voisin at length persuaded her to leave the room and she returned to her own where exhausted by the sufferings of the day she soon fell into deep sleep and awoke considerably refreshed  When the dreadful hour arrived in which the remains of St Aubert were to be taken from her for ever she went alone to the  chamber to look upon his countenance yet once again and La Voisin who had waited patiently below stairs till her despair should subside with the respect due to grief forbore to interrupt the indulgence of it till surprise at the length of her stay and then apprehension overcame his delicacy and he went to lead her from the chamber Having tapped gently at the door without receiving an answer he listened attentively but all was still no sigh no sob of anguish was heard Yet more alarmed by this silence he opened the door and found Emily lying senselessacross the foot of the bed near which stood the coffin His calls procured assistance and she was carried to her room where proper applications at length restored her  During her state of insensibility La Voisin had given directions for the coffin to be closed and he succeeded in persuading Emily to forbear revisiting the chamber She indeed felt herself unequal to this and also perceived the necessity of sparing her spirits and recollecting fortitude sufficient to  bear her through the approaching scene St Aubert had given a particular injunction that his remains should be interred in the church of the convent of St Clair and in mentioning the north chancel near the ancient tomb of the Villerois had pointed out the exact spot where he wished to be laid The superior had granted this place for the interment and thither therefore the sad procession now moved which was met at the gates by the venerable prièst followed by a train of friars Every person who heard the solemn chant of the anthem and the peal of the organ that struck up when the body entered the church and saw also the feeble steps and the assumed tranquillity of Emily gave her involuntary tears She shed none but walked her face partly shaded by a thin black veil between two persons who supported her preceded by the abbess and followed by nuns whose plaintive voices mellowed the swelling harmony of the dirge When the procession came to the grave the music ceased Emily drew the veil entirely  over her face and in a momentary pause between the anthem and the rest of the service her sobs were distinctly audible The holy father began the service and Emily again commanded her feelings till the coffin was let down and she heard the earth rattle on its lid Then as she shuddered a groan burst from her heart and she leaned for support on the person who stood next to her In a few moments she recovered and when she heard those affecting and sublime words "His body is buried in peace and his soul returns to Him that gave it" her anguish softened into tears  The abbess led her from the church into her own parlour and there administered all the consolations that religion and gentle sympathy can give Emily struggled against the pressure of grief but the abbess observing her attentively ordered a bed to be prepared and recommended her to retire to repose She also kindly claimed her promise to remain a few days at the convent and Emily who had no wish to return to the cottage  the scene of all her sufferings had leisure now that no immediate care pressed upon her attention to feel the indisposition which disabled her from immediately travelling  Meanwhile the maternal kindness of the abbess and the gentle attentions of the nuns did all that was possible towards soothing her spirits and restoring her health But the latter was too deeply wounded through the medium of her mind to be quickly revived She lingered for some weeks at the convent under the insluence of a slow fever wishing to return home yet unable to go thither often even reluctant to leave the spot where her father's relics were deposited and sometimes soothing herself with the consideration that if she died here her remains would repose beside those of St Aubert In the meanwhile she sent letters to Madame Cheron and to the old housekeeper informing them of the sad event that had taken place and of her own situation From her aunt she received an answer abounding more in commonplace condolement than in traits of  real sorrow which assured her that a servant should be sent to conduct her to La Vallèe for that her own time was so much occupied by company that she had no leisure to undertake so long a journey However Emily might prefer La Vallèe to Tholouse she could not be insensible of the indecorous and unkind conduct of her aunt in suffering her to return thither where she had no longer a relation to console and protect her a conduct which was the more culpable since St Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter  Madame Cheron's servant made the attendance of the good La Voisin unnecessary and Emily who felt sensibly her obligations to him for all his kind attention to her late father as well as to herself was glad to spare him a long and what at his time of life must have been a troublesome journey  During her stay at the convent the peace and sanctity that reigned within the tranquil beauty of the scenery without and the delicate  attentions of the abbess and the nuns were circumstances so soothing to her mind that they almost tempted her to leave a world where she had lost her dearest friends and devote herself to the cloister in a spot rendered sacred to her by containing the tomb of St Aubert The pensive enthusiasm too so natural to her temper had spread a beautiful illusion over the sanctified retirement of a nun that almost hid from her view the selfishness of its security But the touches which a melancholy fancy slightly tinctured with superstition gave to the monastic scene began to fade as her spirits revived and brought once more to her heart an image which had only transiently been banished thence By this she was silently awakened to hope and comfort and sweet affections visions of happiness gleamed faintly at a distance and though she knew them to be illusions she could not resolve to shut them out for ever It was the remembrance of Valancourt of his taste his genius and of the countenance which glowed with both  that perhaps alone determined her to return to the world The grandeur and sublimity of the scenes amidst which they had first met had fascinated her fancy and had imperceptibly contributed to render Valancourt more interesting by seeming to communicate to him somewhat of their own character The esteem too which St Aubert had repeatedly expressed for him sanctioned this kindness but though his countenance and manner had continually expressed his admiration of her he had no otherwise declared it and even the hope of seeing him again was so distant that she was scarcely conscious of it still less that it influenced her conduct on this occasion  It was several days after the arrival of Madame Cheron's servant before Emily was sufficiently recovered to undertake the journey to La Vallée On the evening preceding her departure she went to the cottage to take leave of La Voisin and his family and to make them a return for their kindness The old man she found sitting  on a bench at his door between his daughter and his soninlaw who was just returned from his daily labour and who was playing upon a pipe that in tone resembled an oboe A flask of wine stood beside the old man and before him a small table with fruit and bread round which stood several of his grandsons fine rosy children who were taking their supper as their mother distributed it On the edge of the little green that spread before the cottage were cattle and a few sheep reposing under the trees The landscape was touched with the mellow light of the evening sun whose long slanting beams played through a vista of the woods and lighted up the distant turrets of the chateau She paused a moment before she emerged from the shade to gaze upon the happy group before heron the complacency and ease of healthy age depictured on the countenance of La Voisin the maternal tenderness of Agnes as she looked upon her children and the innocency of infantine pleasures reflected in their  smiles Emily looked again at the vencrable old man and at the cottage the memory of her father rose with full force upon her mind and she hastily stepped forward afraid to trust herself with a longer pause She took an affectionate and affecting leave of La Voisin and his family he seemed to love her as his daughter and shed tears Emily shed many She avoided going into the cottage since she knew it would revive emotions such as she could not now endure  One painful scene yet awaited her for she determined to visit again her father's grave and that she might not be interrupted or observed in the indulgence of her melancholy tenderness she deferred her visit till every inhabitant of the convent except the nun who promised to bring her the key of the church should be retired to rest Emily remained in her chamber till she heard the convent bell strike twelve when the nun came as she had appointed with the key of a private door that opened into the church and they descended together the narrow  winding staircase that led thither The nun offered to accompany Emily to the grave adding "It is melancholy to go alone at this hour" but the former thanking her for the consideration could not consent to have any witness of her sorrow and the sister having unlocked the door gave her the lamp "You will remember sister" said she "that in the east aisle which you must pass is a newly opened grave hold the light to the ground that you may not stumble over the loose earth" Emily thanking her again took the lamp and stepping into the church sister Mariette departed But Emily paused a moment at the door a sudden fear came over her and she returned to the foot of the staircase where as she heard the steps of the nun ascending and while she held up the lamp saw her black veil waving over the spiral balusters she was tempted to call her back While she hesitated the veil disappeared and in the next moment ashamed of her fears she returned to the church The cold air of the  aisles chilled her and their deep silence and extent feebly shone upon by the moonlight that streamed through a distant gothic window would at any other time have awed her into superstition now grief occupied all her attention She scarcely heard the whispering echoes of her own steps or thought of the open grave till she found herself almost on its brink A friar of the convent had been buried there on the preceding evening and as she had sat alone in her chamber at twilight she heard at distance the monks chanting the requiem for his soul This brought freshly to her memory the circumstances of her father's death and as the voices mingling with a low querulous peal of the organ swelled faintly gloomy and affecting visions had arisen upon her mind Now she remembered them and turning aside to avoid the broken ground these recollections made her pass on with quicker steps to the grave of St Aubert when in the moonlight that fell athwart a remote part of the aisle she thought she saw a shadow gliding  between the pillars She stopped to listen and not hearing any footstep believed that her fancy had deceived her and no longer apprehensive of being observed proceeded St Aubert was buried beneath a plain marble bearing little more than his name and the date of his birth and death near the foot of the stately monument of the Villerois Emily remained at his grave till a chime that called the monks to early prayers warned her to retire then she wept over it a last farewel and forced herself from the spot After this hour of melancholy indulgence she was refreshed by a deeper sleep than she had experienced for a long time and on awakening her mind was more tranquil and resigned than it had been since St Aubert's death  But when the moment of her departure from the convent arrived all her grief returned the memory of the dead and the kindness of the living attached her to the place and for the sacred spot where her father's remains were interred she seemed to  feel all those tender affections which we conceive for home The abbess repeated many kind assurances of regard at their parting and pressed her to return if ever she should find her condition elsewhere unpleasant many of the nuns also expressed unaffected regret at her departure and Emily left the convent with many tears and followed by sincere wishes for her happiness  She had travelled several leagues before the scenes of the country through which she passed had power to rouse her for a moment from the deep melancholy into which she was sunk and when they did it was only to remind her that on her last view of them St Aubert was at her side and to call up to herremembrance the remarks he had delivered on similar scenery Thus without any particular occurrence passed the day in languor and dejection She slept that night at a town on the skirts of Languedoc and on the following morning entered Gascony  Towards the close of this day Emily came within view of the plains in the neighbourhood  of La Vallée and the wellknown objects of former times began to press upon her notice and with them recollections that awakened all her tenderness and grief Often while she looked through her tears upon the wild grandeur of the Pyrenées now varied with the rich lights and shadows of evening she remembered that when last she saw them her father partook with her of the pleasure they inspired Suddenly some scene which he had particularly pointed out to her would present itself and the sick languor of despair would steal upon her heart "There" she would exclaim "there are the very cliffs there the wood of pines which he looked at with such delight as we passed this road together for the last time There too under the crag of that mountain is the cottage peeping from among the cedars which he bade me remember and copy with my pencil O my father shall I never see you more"  As she drew near the chateau these melancholy memorials of past times multiplied  At length the chateau itself appeared amid the glowing beauty of St Aubert's favourite landscape This was an object which called for fortitude not for tears Emily dried hers and prepared to meet with calmness the trying moment of her return to that home where there was no longer a parent to welcome her "Yes" said she "let me not forget the lessons he has taught me How often he has pointed out the necessity of resisting even virtuous sorrow how often we have admired together the greatness of a mind that can at once suffer and reason O my father if you are permitted to look down upon your child it will please you to see that she remembers and endeavours to practise the precepts you have given her"  A turn on the road now allowed a nearer view of the chateau the chimneys tipped with light rising from behind St Aubert's favourite oaks whose foliage partly concealed the lower part of the building Emily could not suppress a heavy sigh "This  too was his favourite hour" said she as she gazed upon the long evening shadows stretched athwart the landscape "How deep the repose how lovely the scene lovely and tranquil as in former days"  Again she resisted the pressure of sorrow till her ear caught the gay melody of the dance which she had so often listened to as she walked with St Aubert on the margin of the Garonne when all her fortitude forsook her and she continued to weep till the carriage stopped at the little gate that opened upon what was now her own territory She raised her eyes on the sudden stopping of the carriage and saw her father's old housekeeper coming to open the gate Manchon also came running and barking before her and when his young mistress alighted fawned and played round her gasping with joy"  "Dear ma'amselle" said Theresa and paused and looked as is she would have offered something of condolement to Emily whose tears now prevented reply The dog  still fawned and ran round her and then flew towards the carriage with a short quick bark "Ah ma'amsllemy poor master" said Theresa whose feelings were more awakened than her delicacy "Manchon's gone to look for him" Emily sobbed aloud and on looking towards the carriage which still stood with the door open saw the animal spring into it and instantly leap out and then with his nose on the ground run round the horses  "Don't cry so ma'amselle" said Theresa "it breaks my heart to see you" The dog now came running to Emily then returned to the carriage and then back again to her whining and discontented "Poor rogue" said Theresa "thou hast lost thy master thou mayst well cry But come my dear young lady be comforted What shall I get to refresh you" Emily gave her hand to the old servant and tried to restrain her grief while she made some kind enquiries concerning her health But she still lingered in the walk which led to the  chateau for within was no person to meet her with the kiss of affection her own heart no longer palpitated with impatient joy to meet again the wellknown smile and she dreaded to see objects which would recall the full remembrance of her sormer happiness She moved slowly towards the door paused went on and paused again How silent how forsaken how forlorn did the chateau appear Trembling to enter it yet blaming herself for delaying what she could not avoid she at length patted into the hall crossed it with a hurried step as if afraid to look round and opened the door of that room which she was wont to call her own The gloom of evening gave solemnity to its silent and deserted air The chairs the tables every article of furniture so familiar to her in happier times spoke eloquently to her heart She seated herself without immediately observing it in a window which opened upon the garden and where St Aubert had often sat with her watching the sun retire from the rich and  extensive prospect that appeared beyond the groves  Having indulged her tears for some time she became more composed and when Theresa after seeing the baggage deposited in her lady's room again appeared she had so far recovered her spirits as to be able to converse with her  "I have made up the green bed for you ma'amselle" said Theresa as she set the coffee upon the table "I thought you would like it better than your own now but I little thought this day month that you would come back alone Awelladay the news almost broke my heart when it did come Who would have believed that my poor master when he went from home would never return again" Emily hid her face with her handkerchief and waved her hand  "Do taste the coffee said Theresa "My dear young lady be comfortedwe must all die My dear master is a saint above" Emily took the handkerchief  from her face and raised her eyes full of tears towards heaven soon after she dried them and in a calm but tremulous voice began to enquire concerning some of her late father's pensioners  "Alasaday" said Theresa as she poured out the cossee and handed it to her mistress "all that could come have been here every day to enquire after you and my master" She then proceeded to tell that some were dead whom they had left well and others who were ill had recovered "And see ma'amselle" added Theresa "there is old Mary coming up the garden now she has looked every day these three years as if she would die yet she is alive still She has seen the chaise at the door and knows you are come home"  The sight of this poor old woman would have been too much for Emily and she begged Theresa would go and tell her that she was too ill to see any person that night "Tomorrow I shall be better perhaps  but give her this token of my remembrance"  Emily sat for some time given up to sorrow Not an object on which her eye glanced but awakened some remembrance that led immediately to the subject of her grief Her favourite plants which St Aubert had taught her to nurse the little drawings that adorned the room which his taste had instructed her to execute the books that he had selected for her use and which they had read together her musical instruments whose sounds he loved so well and which he sometimes awakened himselfevery object gave new force to sorrow At length she roused herself from this melancholy indulgence and summoning all her resolution stepped forward to go into those forlorn rooms which though she dreaded to enter she knew would yet more powerfully affect her if she delayed to visit them  Having passed through the greenhouse her courage for a moment forsook her when  she opened the door of the library and perhaps the shade which evening and the foliage of the trees near the windows threw across the room heightened the solemnity of her feelings on entering that apartment where every thing spoke of her father There was an armchair in which he used to sit she shrunk when she observed it for she had so often seen him seated there and the idea of him rose so distinctly to her mind that she almost fancied she saw him before her But she checked the illusions of a distempered imagination though she could not subdue a certain degree of awe which now mingled with her emotions She walked slowly to the chair and seated herself in it there was a readingdesk before it on which lay a book open as it had been left by her father It was some moments before she recovered courage enough to examine it and when she looked at the open page she immediately recollected that St Aubert on the evening before his departure from the chateau had read to her some passages  from this his favourite author The circumstance now affected her extremely she looked at the page wept and looked again To her the book appeared sacred and invaluable and she would not have moved it or closed the page which he had left open for the treasures of the Indies Still she sat before the desk and could not resolve to quit it though the increasing gloom and the profound silence of the apartment revived a degree of painful awe Her thoughts dwelt on the probable state of departed spirits and she remembered the affecting conversation which had passed between St Aubert and La Voisin on the night preceding his death  As she mused she saw the door slowly open and a rustling sound in a remote part of the room startled her Through the dusk she thought she perceived something move The subject she had been considering and the present tone of her spirits which made her imagination respond to every impression of her senses gave her a  sudden terror of something supernatural She sat for a moment motionless and then her dissipated reason returning "What should I fear" said she "It the spirits of those we love ever return to us it is in kindness"  The silence which again reigned made her ashamed of her late fears and she believed that her imagination had deluded her or that she had heard one of those unaccountable noises which sometimes occur in old houses The same sound however returned and distinguishing something moving towards her and in the next instant press beside her into the chair she shrieked but her fleeting senses were instantly recalled on perceiving that it was Manchon who sat by her and who now licked her hands affectionately  Perceiving her spirits unequal to the talk she had assigned herself of visiting the deserted rooms of the chateau this night when she left the library she walked into the garden and down to the terrace that overhung  the river The sun was now set but under the dark branches of the almond trees was seen the saffron glow of the west spreading beyond the twilight of middle air The bat slitted silently by and now and then the mourning note of the nightingale was heard The circumstances of the hour brought to her recollestion some lines which she had once heard St Aubert recite on this very spot and she had now a melancholy plesure in repeating them  SONNET  Now the bat circles on the breeze of evc  That creeps in shudd'riag sits along the wave  And trembles 'mid the woods and through the cave  Whose lonely sighs the wanderer deceive  For ost when melancholy charms his mind  He thinks the Spirit of the rock he hears  Nor listens but with sweetlythrilling fears  To the low mystic murmurs of the wind  Now the bat circles and the twilightdew  Falls silent round and o'er the mountaincliff  The gleaming wave and fardiscover'd skiff  Spreads the gray veil of soft harmonious hue  So falls o'er Grief the dew of pity's tear  Dimming her lonely visions of despair  Emily wandering on came to St Aubert's favourite planetree where so often at this hour they had sat beneath the shade together and with her dear mother so often had conversed on the subject of a suture state How often too had her father expressed the comfort he derived from believing that they should meet in another world Emily overcome by these recollections left the planetree and as she leaned pensively on the wall of the terrace she observed a group of peasants dancing gaily on the banks of the Garonne which spread in broad expanse below and reflected the evening light What a contrast they formed to the desolate unhappy Emily They were gay and  debonnaire  as they were wont to be when she too was gaywhen St Aubert used to listen to their merry music with a countenance beaming pleasure and benevolence Emily having looked for a moment on this sprightly band turned away unable to bear the remembrances it excited but where alas could she turn  and not meet new objects to give acuteness to grief  As she walked slowly towards the house she was met by Theresa "Dear ma'amselle" said she "I have been seeking you up and down this half hour and was afraid some accident had happened to you How can you like to wander about so in this night air Do come into the house Think what my poor master would have said if he could see you I am sure when my dear lady died no gentleman could take it more to heart than he did yet you know he seldom shed a tear"  "Pray Theresa cease" said Emily wishing to interrupt this illjudged but wellmeaning harangue Theresa's loquacity however was not to be silenced so easily "And when you used to grieve so" she added "he often told you how wrong it wasfor that my mistress was happy And if she was happy I am sure he is so too for the prayers of the poor they say reach heaven" During this speech Emily had  walked silently into the chateau and Theresa lighted her across the hall into the common sitting parlour where she had laid the cloth with one solitary knife and fork for supper Emily was in the room before she perceived that it was not her own apartment but she checked the emotion which inclined her to leave it and seated herself quietly by the little supper table Her father's hat hung upon the opposite wall while she gazed at it a faintness came over her Theresa looked at her and then at the object on which her eyes were settled and went to remove it but Emily waved her hand"No" said she "let it remain I am going to my chamber" "Nay ma'amselle supper is ready" "I cannot take it" replied Emily "I will go to my room and try to sleep Tomorrow I shall be better"  "This is poor doings" said Theresa "Dear lady do take some food I have dressed a pheasant and a fine one it is Old Monsieur Barreaux sent it this morning for  I saw him yesterday and told him you were coming And I know nobody that seemed more concerned when he heard the sad news than he"  "Did he" said Emily in a tender voice while she felt her poor heart warmed for a moment by a ray of sympathy  At length her spirits were entirely overcome and she retired to her room  CHAP X  Can Music's voice can Beauty's eye  Can Painting's glowing hand supply  A charm so suited to my mind  As blows this hollow gust of wind  As drops this little weeping rill  Soft tinkling down the mossgrown hill  While through the west where sinks the crimson day  Meek Twilight slowly fails and waves her banners gray  MASON  EMILY some time after her return to La Vallée received letters from her aunt Madame Cheron in which after some commonplace condolement and advice she invited her to Tholouse and added that as her late brother had entrusted Emily's  education  to her she should consider herself bound to overlook her conduct Emily at this time wished only to remain at La Vallée  in the scenes of her early happiness now rendered infinitely dear to her as the late residence of those whom she had lost for ever where she could weep unobserved retrace their steps and remember each minute particular of their manners But she was equally anxious to avoid the displeasure of Madame Cheron  Though her affection would not suffer her to question even a moment the propriety of St Aubert's conduct in appointing Madame for her guardian she was sensible that this step had made her happiness depend in a great degree on the humour of her aunt In her reply she begged permission to remain at present at La Vallée mentioning the extreme dejection of her spirits and the necessity she felt for quiet and retirement to restore them These she knew were not to be found at Madame Cheron's whose inclinations led her into a life of dissipation which her ample fortune encouraged and having given her answer she felt somewhat more at ease  In the first days of her affliction she was visited by Monsieur Barreaux a sincere mourner for St Aubert "I may well lament my friend" said he "for I shall never meet with his resemblance If I could have found such a man in what is called society I should not have left it"  M Barreaux's admiration of her father endeared him extremely to Emily whose heart found almost its first relief in conversing of her parents with a man whom she so much revered and who though with such an ungracious appearance possessed so much goodness of heart and delicacy of mind  Several weeks passed away in quiet retirement and Emily's affliction began to soften into melancholy She could bear to read the books she had before read with her father to sit in his chair in the libraryto watch the flowers his hand had plantedto awaken the tones of that instrument his fingers had pressed and sometimes even to play his favourite air  When her mind had recovered from the first shock of affliction perceiving the danger of yielding to indolence and that activity alone could restore its tone she scrupulously endeavoured to pass all her hours in employment And it was now that she understood the full value of the education she had received from St Aubert for in cultivating her understanding he had secured her an asylum from indolence without recourse to dissipation and rich and varied amusement and information independent of the society from which her situation secluded her Nor were the good effects of this education confined to selfish advantages since St Aubert having nourished every amiable quality of her heart it now expanded in benevolence to all around her and taught her when she could not remove the misfortunes of others at lead to soften them by sympathy and tendernessa benevolence that taught her to feel for all that could suffer  Madame Cheron returned no answer to Emily's letter who began to hope that she  should be permitted to remain some time longer in her retirement and her mind had now so far recovered its strength that she ventured to view the scenes which most powerfully recalled the images of part times Among these was the fishinghouse and to indulge still more the affectionate melancholy of the visit she took thither her lute that she might again hear there the tones to which St Aubert and her mother had so often delighted to listen She went alone and at that still hour of the evening which is so soothing to fancy and to grief The last time she had been here she was in company with Monsieur and Madame St Aubert a few days preceding that on which the latter was seized with a fatal illness Now when Emily again entered the woods that surrounded the building they awakened so forcibly the memory of former times that her resolution yielded for a moment to excess of grief She stopped leaned for support against a tree and wept for some minutes before she had recovered herself  sufficiently to proceed The little path that led to the building was overgrown with grass and the flowers which St Aubert had scattered carelessly along the border were almost choked with weedsthe tall thistlethe foxglove and the nettle She often paused to look on the desolate spot now so silent and forsaken and when with a trembling hand she opened the door of the fishinghouse "Ah" said she "every thingevery thing remains as when I left it lastleft it with those who never must return" She went to a window that overhung the rivulet and leaning over it with her eyes fixed on the current was soon lost in melancholy reverie The lute she had brought lay forgotten beside her the mournful sighing of the breeze as it waved the high pines above and its softer whispers among the osiers that bowed upon the banks below was a kind of music more in unison with her feelings It did not vibrate on the chords of unhappy memory but was soothing to the heart as the voice of Pity She  continued to muse unconscious of the gloom of evening and that the sun's last light trembled on the heights above and would probably have remained so much longer if a sudden footstep without the building had not alarmed her attention and first made her recollect that she was unprotected In the next moment a door opened and a stranger appeared who stopped on perceiveing Emily and then began to apologize for his intrusion But Emily at the sound of his voice lost her fear in a stronger emotion its tones were familiar to her ear and though she could not readily distinguish through the dusk the features of the person who spoke she felt a remembrance too strong to be distrusted  He repeated his apology and Emily then said something in reply when the stranger eagerly advancing exclaimed "Good God can it besurely I am not mistakenma'amselle St Aubertis it not"  "It is indeed" said Emily who was confirmed in her first conjecture for she  now distinguished the countenance of Valancourt lighted up with still more than its usual animation A thousand painful recollections crowded to her mind and the effort which she made to support herself only served to increase her agitation Valancourt meanwhile having enquired anxiously after her health and expressed his hopes that M St Aubert had found benefit from travelling learned from the flood of tears which she could no longer repress the fatal truth He led her to a seat and sat down by her while Emily continued to weep and Valancourt to hold the hand which she was unconscious he had taken till it was wet with the tears which grief for St Aubert and sympathy for herself had called forth  "I feel" said he at length "I feel how insufficient all attempt at consolation must be on this subject I can only mourn with you for I cannot doubt the source of your tears Would to God I were mistaken"  Emily could still answer only by tears  till she rose and begged they might leave the melancholy spot when Valancourt though he saw her feebleness could not offer to detain her but took her arm within his and led her from the fishinghouse They walked silently through the woods Valancourt anxious to know yet fearing to ask any particulars concerning St Aubert and Emily too much distressed to converse After some time however she acquired fortitude enough to speak of her father and to give a brief account of the manner of his death during which recital Valancourt's countenance betrayed strong emotion and when he heard that St Aubert had died on the road and that Emily had been left among strangers he pressed her hand between his and involuntarily exclaimed "Why was I not there" but in the next moment recollected himself for he immediately returned to the mention of her father till perceiving that her spirits were exhausted he gradually changed the subject and spoke of himself Emily thus learned  that after they had parted he had wandered for some time along the shores of the Mediterranean and had then returned through Languedoc into Gascony which was his native province and where he usually resided  When he had concluded his little narrative he sunk into a silence which Emily was not disposed to interrupt and it continued till they reached the gate of the chateau when he stopped as if he had known this to be the limit of his walk Here saying that it was his intention to return to Estuviere on the following day he asked her if she would permit him to take leave of her in the morning and Emily perceiving that she could not reject an ordinary civility without expressing by her refusal an expectation of something more was compelled to answer that she should be at home  She passed a melancholy evening during which the retrospect of all that had happened since she had seen Valancourt would rise to her imagination and the scene of her  father's death appeared in tints as fresh as if it had passed on the preceding day She remembered particularly the earnest and solemn manner in which he had required her to destroy the manuscript papers and awakening from the lethargy in which sorrow had held her she was shocked to think she had not yet obeyed him and determined that another day should not reproach her with the neglect  CHAP XI  Can such things be  And overcome us like a summer's cloud  Without our special wonder  MACBETH  ON the next morning Emily ordered a fire to be lighted in the stove of the chamber where St Aubert used to sleep and as soon as she had breakfasted went thither to burn the papers Having fastened the door to prevent interruption she opened the closet where they were concealed as she entered which she felt an emotion of unusual awe and stood for some moments surveying it trembling and almost afraid to remove the board There was a great chair in one corner of the closet and opposite to it stood the table at which she had seen her father sit on the evening that preceded his departure looking over  with so much emotion what she believed to be these very papers  The solitary life which Emily had led of late and the melancholy subjects on which she had suffered her thoughts to dwell had rendered her at times sensible to the "thickcoming fancies" of a mind greatly enervated It was lamentable that her excellent understanding should have yielded even for a moment to the reveries of superstition or rather to those starts of imagination which deceive the senses into what can be called nothing less than momentary madness Instances of this temporary failure of mind had more than once occurred since her return home particularly when wandering through this lonely mansion in the evening twilight she had been alarmed by appearances which would have been unseen in her more cheerful days To this infirm state of her nerves may be attributed what she imagined when her eyes glancing a second time on the armchair which stood in an obscure part of the closet the  countenance of her dead father appeared there Emily stood fixed for a moment to the floor after which she left the closet Her spirits however soon returned she reproached herself with the weakness of thus suffering interruption in an act of serious importance and again opened the door By the directions which St Aubert had given her she readily found the board he had described in an opposite corner of the closet near the window she distinguished also the line he had mentioned and pressing it as he had bade her it slid down and disclosed the bundle of papers together with some scattered ones and the purse of louis With a trembling hand she removed them replaced the board paused a moment and was rising from the floor when on looking up there appeared to her alarmed fancy the same countenance in the chair The illusion another instance of the unhappy effect which solitude and grief had gradually produced upon her mind subdued her spirits she rushed forward  into the chamber and sunk almost senseless into a chair Returning reason soon overcame the dreadful but pitiable attack of imagination and she turned to the papers though still with so little recollecttion that her eyes involuntarily settled on the writing of some loose sheets which lay open and she was unconscious that she was transgressing her father's strict injunction till a sentence of dreadful import awakened her attention and her memory together She hastily put the papers from her but the words which had roused equally her curiosity and terror she could not dismiss from her thoughts So powerfully had they affected her that she even could not resolve to destroy the papers immediately and the more she dwelt on the circumstance the more it inflamed her imagination Urged by the most forcible and apparently the most necessary curiosity to enquire farther concerning the terrible and mysterious subject to which she had seen an allusion she began to lament her promise  to destroy the papers For a moment she even doubted whether it could justly be obeyed in contradiction to such reasons as there appeared to be for further information But the delusion was momentary  "I have given a solemn promise" said she "to observe a solemn injunction and it is not my business to argue but to obey Let me hasten to remove the temptation that would destroy my innocence and embitter my life with the consciousness of irremediable guilt while I have strength to reject it"  Thus reanimated with a sense of her duty she completed the triumph of integrity over temptation more forcible than any she had ever known and consigned the papers to the flames Her eyes watched them as they slowly consumed she shuddered at the recollection of the sentence she had just seen and at the certainty that the only opportunity of explaining it was then passing away for ever  It was long after this that she recollected the purse and as she was depositing it unopened in a cabinet perceiving that it contained something of a size larger than coin she examined it "His hand deposited them here" said she as she kissed some pieces of the coin and wetted them with her tears "his handwhich is now dust" At the bottom of the purse was a small packet having taken out which and unfolded paper after paper she found to be an ivory case containing the miniature of alady She started"The same" said she "my father wept over" On examining the countenance she could recollect no person that it resembled It was of uncommon beauty and was characterized by an expression of sweetness shaded with sorrow and tempered by resignation  St Aubert had given no directions concerning this picture nor had even named it she therefore thought herself justified in preserving it More than once remembering his manner when he had spoken of  the Marchioness of Villeroi she felt inclined to believe that this was her resemblance yet there appeared no reason why he should have preserved a picture of that lady or having preserved it why he should lament over it in a manner so striking and affecting as she had witnessed on the night preceding his departure  Emily still gazed on the countenance examining its features but she knew not where to detect the charm that captivated her attention and inspired sentiments of such love and pity Dark brown hair played carelessly along the open forehead the nose was rather inclined to aquiline the lips spoke in a smile but it was a melancholy one the eyes were blue and were directed upwards with an expression of peculiar meekness while the soft cloud of the brow spoke the fine sensibility of the temper  Emily was roused from the musing mood into which the picture had thrown her by the closing of the garden gate and on turning her eyes to the window she saw Valancourt coming towards the chateau  Her spirits agitated by the subjects that had lately occupied her mind she felt unprepared to see him and remained a few moments in the chamber to recover herself  When she met him in the parlour she was struck with the change that appeared in his air and countenance since they had parted in Rousillon which twilight and the distress she suffered on the preceding evening had prevented her from observing But dejection and languor disappeared for a moment in the smile that now enlightened his countenance on perceiving her "You see" said he "I have availed myself of the permission with which you honoured meof bidding  you  farewell whom I had the happiness of meeting only yesterday"  Emily smiled faintly and anxious to say something asked if he had been long in Gascony "A few days only" replied Valancourt while a blush passed over his cheek "I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting with the  friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees so delightful"  A tear came to Emily's eye as Valancourt said this which he observed and anxious to draw off her attention from the remembrance that had occasioned it as well as shocked at his own thoughtlessness he began to speak on other subjects expressing his admiration of the chateau and its prospects Emily who felt somewhat embarrassed how to support a conversation was glad of such an opportunity to continue it on indifferent topics They walked down to the terrace where Valancourt was charmed with the river scenery and the views over the opposite shores of Guienne  As he leaned on the wall of the terrace watching the rapid current of the Garonne "I was a few weeks ago" said he "at the source of this noble river I had not then the happiness of knowing you or I should have regretted your absenceit was a scene so exactly suited to your taste It rises in a part of the Pyrenées still wilder and more  sublime I think than any we passed in the way to Rousillon" He then described its fall among thé precipices of the mountains where its waters augmented by the streams that descend from the snowy summits around rush into the Vallée d'Aran between whose romantic heights it foams along pursuing its way to the north west till it emerges upon the plains of Languedoc Then washing the walls of Tholouse and turning again to the north west it assumes a milder character as it fertilizes the pastures of Gascony and Guienne in its progress to the Bay of Biscay  Emily and Valancourt talked of the scenes they had passed among the Pyrenean Alps as he spoke of which there was often a tremulous tenderness in his voice and sometimes he expatiated on them with all the fire of genius sometimes would appear scarcely conscious of the topic though he continued to speak This subject recalled forcibly to Emily the idea of her father whose image appeared in every landscape which Valancourt  particularized whose remarks dwelt upon her memory and whose enthusiasm still glowed in her heart Her silence at length reminded Valancourt how nearly his conversation approached to the occasion of her grief and he changed the subject though for one scarcely less affecting to Emily When he admired the grandeur of the planetree that spread its wide branches over the terrace and under whose shade they now sat she remembered how often she had sat thus with St Aubert and heard him express the same admiration  "This was a favourite tree with my dear father" said she "he used to love to sit under its foliage with his family about him in the fine evenings of summer"  Valancourt understood her feelings and was silent had she raised her eyes from the ground she would have seen tears in his He rose and leaned on the wall of the terrace from which in a few moments he returned to his seat then rose again and appeared to be greatly agitated while Emily  found her spirits so much depressed that several of her attempts to renew the conversation were ineffectual Valancourt again sat down but was still silent and trembled At length he said with a hesitating voice "This lovely sceneI am going to leaveto leave youperhaps for ever These moments may never return I cannot resolve to neglect though I scarcely dare to avail myself of them Let me however without offending the delicacy of your sorrow venture to declare the admiration I must always feel of your goodnessO that at some future period I might be permitted to call it love"  Emily's emotion would not suffer her to reply and Valancourt who now ventured to look up observing her countenance change expected to see her faint and made an involuntary effort to support her which recalled Emily to a sense of her situation and to an exertion of her spirits Valancourt did not appear to notice her indisposition but when he spoke again his voice told the tenderest love "I will not presume"  he added "to intrude this subject longer upon your attention at this time but I may perhaps be permitted to mention that these parting moments would lose much of their bitterness if I might be allowed to hope the declaration I have made would not exclude me from your presence in future"  Emily made another effort to overcome the confusion of her thoughts and to speak She feared to trust the preference her heart acknowledged towards Valancourt and to give him any encouragement for hope on so short an acquaintance For though in this narrow period she had observed much that was admirable in his taste and disposition and though these observations had been sanctioned by the opinion of her father they were not sufficient testimonies of his general worth to determine her upon a subject so infinitely important to her future happiness as that which now solicited her attention Yet though the thought of dismissing Valancourt was so very painful to her that she could scarcely endure to pause upon it  the consiousness of this made her fear the partiality of her judgment and hesitate still more to encourage that suit for which her own heart too tenderly pleaded The family of Valancourt if not his circumstances had been known to her father and known to be unexceptionable Of his circumstances Valancourt himself hinted as far as delicacy would permit when he said he had at present little else to offer but an heart that adored her He had solicited only for a distant hope and she could not resolve to forbid though she scarcely dared to permit it at length she acquired courage to say that she must think herself honoured by the good opinion of any person whom her father had esteemed  "And was I then thought worthy of his esteem" said Valancourt in a voice trembling with anxiety then checking himself he added "But pardon the question I scarcely know what I say If I might dare to hope that you think me not unworthy such honour and might be permitted sometimes  to enquire after your health I should now leave you with comparative tranquillity"  Emily after a moment's silence said "I will be ingenuous with you for I know you will understand and allow for my situation you will consider it as a proof of mymy esteem that I am so Though I live here in what was my father's house I live here alone I have alas no longer a parenta parent whose presence might sanction your visits It is unnecessary for me to point out the impropriety of my receiving them"  "Nor will I affect to be insensible of this" replied Valancourt adding mournfully"but what is to console me for my candour I distress you and would now leave the subject if I might carry with me a hope of being some time permitted to renew it of being allowed to make myself known to your family"  Emily was again confused and again hesitated what to reply she felt most acutely the difficultythe forlornness of her situation  which did not allow her a single relative or friend to whom me could turn for even a look that might support and guide her in the present embarrassing circumstances Madame Cheron who was her only relative and ought to have been this friend was either occupied by her own amusements or so resentful of the reluctance her niece had shewn to quit La Vallée that she seemed totally to have abandoned her  "Ah I see" said Valancourt after a long pause during which Emily had begun and left unfinished two three sentences "I see that I have nothing to hope my fears were too just you think me unworthy of your esteem That fatal journey which I considered as the happiest period of my lifethose delightful days were to embitter all my future ones How often I have looked back to them with hope and fearyet never till this moment could I prevail with myself to regret their enchanting influence"  His voice faltered and he abruptly quitted his seat and walked on the terrace  There was an expression of despair on his countenance that affected Emily The pleadings of her heart overcame in some degree her extreme timidity and when he resumed his seat she said in an accent that betrayed her tenderness "You do both yourself and me injustice when you say I think you unworthy of my esteem I will acknowledge that you have long possessed it andand"  Valancourt waited impatiently for the conclusion of the sentence but the words died on her lips Her eyes however reflected all the emotions of her heart Valancourt passed in an instant from the impatience of despair to that of joy and tenderness "O Emily" he exclaimed "my own Emilyteach me to sustain this moment Let me seal it as the most sacred of my life"  He pressed her hand to his lips it was cold and trembling and raising his eyes he saw the paleness of her countenance Tears came to her relief and Valancourt watched in anxious silence over her In a  few moments she recovered herself and smiling faintly through her tears said "Can you excuse this weakness My spirits have not yet I believe recovered from the shock they lately received"  "I cannot excuse myself" said Valancourt "but I will forbear to renew the subject which may have contributed to agitate them now that I can leave you with the sweet certainty of possessing your esteem  Then forgetting his resolution he again spoke of himself "You know not" said he "the many anxious hours I have passed near you lately when you believed me if indeed you honoured me with a thought far away I have wandered near the chateau in the still hours of the night when no eye could observe me It was delightful to know I was so near you and there was something particularly soothing in the thought that I watched round your habitation while you slept These grounds are not entirely new to me Once I ventured within the sence and spent  one of the happiest and yet most melancholy hours of my life in walking under what I believed to be your window"  Emily enquired how long Valancourt had been in the neighbourhood "Several days" he replied "It was my design to avail myself of the permission M St Aubert had given me I scarcely know how to account for it but though I anxiously wished to do this my resolution always failed when the moment approached and I constantly deferred my visit I lodged in a village at some distance and wandered with my dogs among the scenes of this charming country wishing continually to meet you yet not daring to visit you"  Having thus continued to converse without perceiving the flight of time Valancourt at length seemed to recollect himself "I must go" said he mournsully "but it is with the hope of seeing you again of being permitted to pay my respects to your family let me hear this hope confirmed by your voice" "My family will be happy to see  any friend of my dear father" said Emily Valancourt kissed her hand and still lingered unable to depart while Emily sat silently with her eyes bent on the ground and Valancourt as he gazed on her considered that it would soon be impossible for him to recall even to his memory the exact resemblance of the beautiful countenance he then beheld at this moment an hasty footstep approached from behind the planetree and turning her eyes Emily saw Madame Cheron She felt a blush steal upon her cheek and her frame trembled with the emotion of her mind but she instantly rose to meet her visitor "So niece" said Madame Cheron casting a look of surprise and enquiry on Valancourt "so niece how do you do But I need not ask your looks tell me you have already recovered your loss"  "My looks do me injustice then Madam my loss I know can never be recovered"  "WellI will not argue with you I see you have exactly your father's  disposition and let me tell you it would have been much happier for him poor man if it had been a different one"  A look of dignified displeasure with which Emily regarded Madame Cheron while she spoke would have touched almost any other heart she made no other reply but introduced Valancourt who could scarcely stifle the resentment he selt and whose bow Madame Cheron returned with a slight curtesy and a look of supercilious examination After a few moments he took leave of Emily in a manner that hastily expressed his pain both at his own departure and at leaving her to the society of Madame Cheron  "Who is that young man" said her aunt in an accent which equally implied inquisitiveness and censure "Some idle admirer of yours I suppose but I believed niece you had a greater sense of propriety than to have received the visits of any young man in your present unfriended situation Let me tell you the world will observe those  things and it will talk aye and very freely too"  Emily extremely shocked at this coarse speech attempted to interrupt it but Madame Cheron would proceed with all the selfimportance of a person to whom power is new  "It is very necessary you should be under the eye of some person more able to guide you than yourself I indeed have not much leisure for such a task however since your poor father made it his last request that I should overlook your conductI must even take you "under my care But this let me tell you niece that unless you will determine to be very conformable to my direction I shall not trouble myself longer about you"  Emily made no attempt to interrupt Madame Cheron a second time grief and the pride of conscious innocence kept her silent till her aunt said "I am now come to take you with me to Thoulouse I am sorry to find that your poor father died after all  in such indifferent circumstances however I shall take you home with me Ah poor man he was always more generous than provident or he would not have left his daughter dependent on his relations"  "Nor has he done so I hope madam" said Emily calmly "nor did his pecuniary misfortunes arise from that noble generosity which always distinguished him The affairs of M de Motteville may I trust yet be settled without deeply injuring his creditors and in the mean time I should be very happy to remain at La Vallée"  "No doubt you would" replied Madame Cheron with a smile of irony "and I shall no doubt consent to this since I see how necessary tranquillity and retirement are to restore your spirits I did not think you capable of so much duplicity niece when you pleaded this excuse for remaining here I foolishly believed it to be a just one nor expected to have found with you so agreeable a companion as this M La Val I forget his name"  Emily could no longer endure these cruel indignities "It was a just one madam" said she "and now indeed I feel more than ever the value of the retirement I then solicited and if the purport of your visit is only to add insult to the sorrows of your brother's child she could well have spared it"  "I see that I have undertaken a very troublesome task" said Madame Cheron colouring highly "I am sure madam" said Emily mildly and endeavouring to restrain her tears "I am sure my father did not mean it should be such I have the happiness to reflect that my conduct under his eye was such as he often delighted to approve It would be very painful to me to disobey the sister of such a parent and if you believe the task will really be so troublesome I must lament that it is yours"  "Well niece fine speaking signifies little I am willing in consideration of my poor brother to overlook the impropriety of your  late conduct and to try what your future will be"  Emily interrupted her to beg she would explain what was the impropriety she alluded to  "What impropriety why that of receiving the visits of a lover unknown to your family" replied Madame Cheron not considering the impropriety of which she had herself been guilty in exposing her niece to the possibility of conduct so erroneous  A faint blush passed over Emily's countenance pride and anxiety struggled in her breast and till she recollected that appearances did in some degree justify her aunt's suspicions she could not resolve to humble herself so far as to enter into the defence of a conduct which had been so innocent and undesigning on her part She mentioned the manner of Valancourt's introduction to her father the circumstance of his receiving the pistolshot and of their afterwards travelling together with the accidental way in which she had met him on  the preceding evening She owned he had declared a partiality for her and that he had asked permission to address her family  "And who is this young adventurer pray" said Madame Cheron "and what are his pretensions" "These he must himself explain madam" replied Emily "Of his family my father was not ignorant and I believe it is unexceptionable" She then proceeded to mention what she knew concerning it  "O then this it seems is a younger brother" exclaimed her aunt "and of course a beggar A very sine tale indeed And so my brother took a fancy to this young man after only a few days acquaintancebut that was so like him In his youth he was always taking these likes and dislikes when no other person saw any reason for them at all nay indeed I have often thought the people he disapproved were much more agreeable than those he admiredbut there is no accounting for tastes He was always so much influenced  by people's countenances now I for my part have no notion of this it is all ridiculous enthusiasm What has a man's face to do with his character Can a man of good character help having a disagreeable face"which last sentence Madame Cheron delivered with the decisive air of a person who congratulates herself on having made a grand discovery and believes the question to be unanswerably settled  Emily desirous of concluding the conversation enquired if her aunt would accept some resreshment and Madame Cheron accompanied her to the chateau but without desisting from a topic which she discussed with so much complacency to" herself and severity to her niece  "I am sorry to perceive niece" said she in allusion to somewhat that Emily had said concerning physiognomy "that you have a great many of your father's prejudices and among them are those sudden predilections for people from their looks I can perceive that you imagine yourself to be  violently in love with this young adventurer after an acquaintance of only a few days There was something too so charmingly romantic in the manner of your meeting"  Emily checked the tears that trembled in her eyes while she said "When my conduct mall deserve this severity madam you will do well to exercise it till then justice if not tenderness should surely restrain it I have never willingly offended you now I have loft my parents you are the only person to whom I can look for kindness Let me not lament more than ever the loss of such parents" The last words were almost stifled by her emotions and she burst into tears Remembering the delicacy and the tenderness of St Aubert the happy happy days she had passed in these scenes and contrasting them with the coarse and unfeeling behaviour of Madame Cheron and with the future hours of mortification she must submit to in her presencea degree of grief seized her that almost reached despair Madame Cheron more offended by the reproof  which Emily's words conveyed than touched by the sorrow they expressed said nothing that might soften her grief but notwithstanding an apparent reluctance to receive her niece she desired her company The love of sway was her ruling passion and she knew it would be highly gratified by taking into her house a young orphan who had no appeal from her decisions and on whom she could exercise without controul the capricious humour of the moment  On entering the chateau Madame Cheron expressed a desire that she would put up what she thought necessary to take to Tholouse as she meant to set off immediately Emily now tried to persuade her to defer the journey at least till the next day and at length with much difficulty prevailed  The day passed in the exercise of petty tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron and in mournful regret and melancholy anticipation on that of Emily who when her aunt retired to her apartment for the night went to take leave of every other  room in this her dear native home which she was now quitting for she knew not how long and for a world to which she was wholly a stranger She could not conquer a presentiment which frequently occurred to her this nightthat she should never more return to La Vallée Having passed a considerable time in what had been her father's study having selected some of his favourite authors to put up with her clothes and shed many tears as she wiped the dust from their covers she seated herself in his chair before the reading desk and sat lost in melancholy reflection till Theresa opened the door to examine as was her custom before she went to bed if all was safe She started on observing her young lady who bade her come in and then gave her some directions for keeping the chateau in readiness for her reception at all times  "Alasa day that you should leave it" said Theresa "I think you would be happier here than where you are going if one may judge" Emily made no reply to this  remark he sorrow Theresa proceeded to express at her departure assected her but she sound some comfort in the simple affecttion of this poor old servant to whom she gave such directions as might best conduce to her comfort during her own absence  Having dismissed Theresa to bed Emily wandered through every lonely apartment of the chateau lingering long in what had been her father's bedroom indulging melancholy yet not unpleasing emotions and having often returned within the door to take another look at it she withdrew to her own chamber From her window she gazed upon the garden below shewn faintly by the moon rising over the tops of the palmtrees and at length the calm beauty of the night increased a desire of indulging the mournful sweetness of bidding farewel to the beloved shades of her childhood till she was tempted to descend Throwing over her the light veil in which she usually walked she silently passed into the garden and hastening towards the distant groves was glad to breathe  once more the air of liberty and to sigh unobserved The deep repose of the scene the rich scents that floated on the breeze the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the clear blue arch soothed and gradually elevated her mind to that sublime complacency which renders the vexations of this world so insignificant and mean in our eyes that we wonder they have had power for a moment to disturb us Emily forgot Madame Cheron and all the circumstances of her conduct while her thoughts ascended to the contemplation of those unnumbered worlds that lie scattered in the depths of aether thausands of them hid from human eyes and almost beyond the slight of human fancy As her imagination soared through the regions of space and aspired to that Great First Cause which pervades and governs all being the idea of her father scarcely ever lest her but it was a pleasing idea since she resigned him to God in the full confidence of a pure and holy faith She pursued her way through the groves to the  terrace often pausing as memory awakened the pang of affection and as reason anticipated the exile into which she was going  And now the moon was high over the woods touching their summits with yellow light and darting between the foliage long level beams while on the rapid Garonne below the trembling radiance was faintly obscured by the lightest vapour Emily long watched the playing lustre listened to the soothing murmur of the current and the yet lighter sounds of the air as it stirred at intervals the lofty palmtrees "How delightful is the sweet breath of these groves" said she "This lovely scenehow often shall I remember and regret it when I am far away Alas What events may occur before I see it again O peaceful happy shadesscenes of my infant delights of parental tenderness now lost for everwhy must I leave yeIn your retreats I should still sind safety and repose Sweet hours of my childhoodI am now to leave even your last memorials No objects  that would revive your impressions will remain for me"  Then drying her tears and looking up her thoughts rose again to the sublime subject she had contemplated the same divine complacency stole over her heart and hushing its throbs inspired hope and confidence and resignation to the will of the Deity whose works filled her mind with adoration  Emily gazed long on the planetree and then seated herself for the last time on the bench under its shade where she had so often sat with her parents and where only a few hours before she had conversed with Valancourt at the remembrance of whom thus revived a mingled sensation of esteem tenderness and anxiety rose in her breast With this remembrance occurred a recollection of his late confessionthat he had often wandered near her habitation in the night having even passed the boundary of the garden and it immediately occurred to her that he might be at this moment in the  grounds The fear of meeting him particularly after the declaration he had made and of incurring a censure which her aunt might so reasonably bestow if it was known that she was met by her lover at this hour made her instantly leave her beloved planetree and walk towards the chateau She cast an anxious eye around and often stopped for a moment to examine the shadowy scene before she ventured to proceed but she passed on without perceiving any person till having reached a clump of almond trees not far from the house she rested to take a retrospect of the garden and tosigh forth another adieu As her eyes wandered over the landscape she thought she perceived a person emerge from the groves and pass slowly along a moonlight alley that led between them but the distance and the imperfect light would not suffer her to judge with any degree of certainty whether this was fancy or reality She continued to gaze for some time on the spot till an the dead stillness of the air she heard  a sudden sound and in the next instant fancied she distinguished footsteps near her Wasting not another moment in conjecture she hurried to the chateau and having reached it retired to her chamber where as she closed her window she looked upon the garden and then again thought she distinguished a figure gliding between the almond trees she had just left She immediately withdrew from the casement and though much agitated sought in sleep the refreshment of a short oblivion  CHAP XII  I leave that flowery path for aye  Of childhood where I sported many a day  Warbling and sauntering carelessly along  Where every face was innocent and gay  Each vale romantic tuneful every tongue  Sweet wild and artless all  THE MINSTREL  AT an early hour the carriage which was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to Tholouse appeared at the door of the chateau and Madame was already in the breakfastroom when her niece entered it The repast was silent and melancholy on the part of Emily and Madame Cheron whose vanity was piqued on observing her dejection reproved her in a manner that did not contribute to remove it It was with much reluctance that Emily's request to take with her the dog which had been a  favourite of her father was granted Her aunt impatient to be gone ordered the carriage to draw up and while she passed to the hall door Emily gave another look into the library and another farewell glance over the garden and then followed Old Theresa stood at the door to take leave of her young lady "God for ever keep you ma'amselle" said she while Emily gave her hand in silence and could answer only with a pressure of her hand and a forced smile  At the gate which led out of the grounds several of her father's pensioners were assembled to bid her farewell to whom she would have spoken if her aunt would have suffered the driver to stop and having distributed to them almost all the money she had about her she sunk back in the carriage yielding to the melancholy of her heart Soon after she caught between the steepbanks of the road another view of the chateau peeping from among the high trees and surrounded by green slopes  and tufted groves the Garonne winding its way beneath their shades sometimes lost among the vineyards and then rising in greater majesty in the distant pastures The towering precipices of the Pyrenées that rose to the south gave Emily a thousand interesting recollections of her late journey and these objects of her former enthusiastic admiration now excited only sorrow and regret Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely scenery till the banks again closed upon them her mind became too much occupied by mournful reflections to permit her to attend to the conversation which Madame Cheron had begun on some trivial topic so that they soon travelled in profound silence  Valancourt mean while was returned to Estuviere his heart occupied with the image of Emily sometimes indulging in reveries of future happiness but more frequently shrinking with dread of the opposition he might encounter from her family He was the younger son of an ancient family of  Gascony and having lost his parents at an early period of his life the care of his education and of his small portion had devolved to his brother the Count de Duvarney his senior by nearly twenty years Valancourt had been educated in all the accomplishments of his age and had an ardour of spirit and a certain grandeur of mind that gave him particular excellence in the exercises then thought heroic His little fortune had been diminished by the necessary expences of his education but M La Valancourt the elder seemed to think that his genius and accomplishments would amply supply the deficiency of his inheritance They offered flattering hopes of promotion in the military profession in those times almost the only one in which a gentleman could engage without incurring a stain on his name and La Valancourt was of course enrolled in the army The general genius of his mind was but little understood by his brother That ardour for whatever is great and good in the moral world as well as  in the natural one displayed itself in his infant years and the strong indignation which he felt and expressed at a criminal or a mean action sometimes drew upon him the displeasure of his tutor who reprobated it under the general term of violence of temper and who when haranguing on the virtues of mildness and moderation seemed to forget the gentleness and compassion which always appeared in his pupil towards objects of misfortune  He had now obtained leave of absence from his regiment when he made the excursion into the Pyrenées which was the means of introducing him to St Aubert and as this permission was nearly expired he was the more anxious to declare himself to Emily's family from whom he reasonably apprehended opposition since his fortune though with a moderate addition from hers it would be sufficient to support them would not satisfy the views either of vanity or ambition Valancourt was not without the latter but he saw golden visions of promotion  in the army and believed that with Emily he could in the mean time be delighted to live within the limits of his humble income His thoughts were now occupied in considering the means of making himself known to her family to whom however he had yet no address for he was entirely ignorant of Emily's precipitate departure from La Vallée of whom he hoped to obtain it  Meanwhile the travelers pursued their journey Emily making frequent efforts to appear chearful and too often relapsing into silence and dejection Madame Cheron attributing her melancholy solely to the circumstance of her being removed to a distance from her lover and believing that the sorrow which her niece still expressed for the loss of St Aubert proceeded partly from an affectation of sensibility endeavoured to make it appear ridiculous to her that such deep regret mould continue to be felt so long after the period usually allowed for grief  At length these unpleasant lectures were interrupted by the arrival of the travellers at Tholouse and Emily who had not been there for many years and had only a very faint recollection of it was surprised at the ostentatious style exhibited in her aunt's house and furniture the more so perhaps because it was so totally different from the modest elegance to which she had been accustomed She followed Madame Cheron through a large hall where several servants in rich liveries appeared to a kind of saloon fitted up with more shew than taste and her aunt complaining of fatigue ordered supper immediately "I am glad to find myself in my own house again" said she throwing herself on a large settee "and to have my own people about me I detest travelling though indeed I ought to like it for what I see abroad always makes me delighted to return to my own chateau What makes you so silent childWhat is it that difturbs you now"  Emily suppressed a starting tear and  tried to smile away the expression of an oppressed heart she was thinking of  her  home and felt too sensibly the arrogance and ostentatious vanity of Madame Cheron's conversation "Can this be my father's sister" said she to herself and then the conviction that she was so warming her heart with something like kindness towards her she felt anxious to soften the harsh impression her mind had received of her aunt's character and to shew a willingness to oblige her The effort did not entirely fail she listened with apparent chearfulness while Madame Cheron expatiated on the splendour of her house told of the numerous parties she entertained and what she should expect of Emily whose diffidence assumed the air of a reserve which her aunt believing it to be that of pride and ignorance united now took occasion to reprehend She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind that fears to trust its own powers which possessing a nice judgment and inclining to believe that every other person perceives  still more critically fears to commit itself to censure and seeks shelter in the obscurity of silence Emily had frequently blushed at the fearless manners which she had seen admired and the brilliant nothings which she had heard applauded yet this applause so far from encouraging her to imitate the conduct that had won it rather made her shrink into the reserve that would protect her from such absurdity  Madame Cheron looked on her niece's diffidence with a feeling very near to contempt and endeavoured to overcome it by reproof rather than to encourage it by gentleness  The entrance of supper somewhat interrupted the complacent discourse of Madame Cheron and the painful considerations which it had forced upon Emily When the repast which was rendered ostentatious by the attendance of a great number of servants and by a profusion of plate was over Madame Cheron retired to her chamber and a female servant came to shew Emily  to hers Having passed up a large stair case and through several galleries they came to a flight of back stairs which led into a short passage in a remote part of the chateau and there the servant opened the door of a small chamber which she said was Ma'amselle Emily's who once more alone indulged the tears she had long tried to restrain  Those who know from experience how much the heart becomes attached even to inanimate objects to which it has been long accustomed how unwillingly it resigns them how with the sensations of an old friend it meets them after temporary absence will understand the forlornness of Emily's feelings of Emily shut out from the only home she had known from her infancy and thrown upon a scene and among persons disagreeable for more qualities than their novelty Her father's favourite dog now in the chamber thus seemed to acquire the character and importance of a friend and as the animal fawned over her  when she wept and licked her hands "Ah poor Manchon" said she "I have nobody now to love mebut you" and she wept the more After some time her thoughts returning to her father's injunctions she remembered how often he had blamed her for indulging useless sorrow how often he had pointed out to her the necessity of fortitude and patience assuring her that the faculties of the mind strengthen by exertion till they finally unnerve affliction and triumph over it These recollections dried her tears gradually soothed her spirits and inspired her with the sweet emulation of practising precepts which her father had so frequently inculcated  CHAP XIII  Some pow'r impart the spear and shield  At which the wizard passions fly  By which the giant follies die  COLLINS  MADAME Cheron's house stood at a little distance from the city of Tholouse and was surrounded by extensive gardens in which Emily who had arisen early amused herself with wandering before breakfast From a terrace that extended along the highest part of them was a wide view over Languedoc On the distaht horizon to the south she discovered the wild summits of the Pyrenées and her fancy immediately painted the green pastures of Gascony at their feet Her heart pointed to her peaceful hometo the neighbourhood where Valancourt waswhere St  Aubert had been and her imagination piercing the veil of distance brought that home to her eyes in all its interesting and romantic beauty She experienced an inexpressible pleasure in believing that she beheld the country around it though no feature could be distinguished except the retiring chain of the Pyrenées and inattentive to the scene immediately before her and to the flight of time she continued to lean on the window of a pavilion that terminated the terrace with her eyes fixed on Gascony and her mind occupied with the interesting ideas which the view of it awakened till a servant came to tell her breakfast was ready Her thoughts thus recalled to the surrounding objects the straight walks square parterres and artificial fountains of the garden could not fail as she passed through it to appear the worse opposed to the negligent graces and natural beauties of the grounds at La Vallée upon which her recollection had been so intensely employed  "Whither have you been rambling so early" said Madame Cheron as her niece entered the breakfastroom "I don't approve of these solitary walks" and Emily was surprised when having informed her aunt that she had been no further than the gardens she understood these to be included in the reproof "I desire you will not walk there again at so early an hour unattended" said Madame Cheron "my gardens are very extensive and a young woman who can make assignations by moonlight at La Vallée is not to be trusted to her own inclinations elsewhere"  Emily extremely surprised and shocked had scarcely power to beg an explanation of these words and when she did her aunt absolutely refused to give it though by her severe looks and half sentences she appeared anxious to impress Emily with a belief that she was well informed of some degrading circumstances of her conduct Conscious innocence could not prevent a blush from stealing over Emily's cheek she trembled  and looked confusedly under the bold eye of Madame Cheron who blushed also but hers was the blush of triumph such as sometimes stains the countenance of a person congratulating himself on the penetration which had taught him to suspect another and who loses both pity for the supposed criminal and indignation of his guilt in the gratification of his own vanity  Emily not doubting that her aunt's mistake arose from the having observed her ramble in the garden on the night preceding her departure from La Vallée now mentioned the motive of it at which Madame Cheron smiled contemptuously refusing either to accept this explanation or to give her reasons for refusing it and soon after she concluded the subject by saying "I never trust people's assertions I always judge of them by their actions but I am willing to try what will be your behaviour in future"  Emily less surprised by her aunt's moderation and mysterious silence than by the  accusation she had received deeply considered the latter and scarcely doubted that it was Valancourt whom she had seen at night in the gardens of La Vallée and that he had been observed there by Madame Cheron who now passing from one painful topic only to revive another almost equally so spoke of the situation of her niece's property in the hands of M Motteville While she thus talked with oftentatious pity of Emily's misfortunes she failed not to inculcate the duties of humility and gratitude or to render Emily fully sensible of every cruel mortification who soon perceived that she was to be considered as a dependent not only by her aunt but by her aunt's servants  She was now informed that a large party were expected to dinner on which account Madame Cheron repeated the lesson of the preceding night concerning her conduct in company and Emily wished that she might have courage enough to practise it Her aunt then proceeded to examine the simplicity of her dress adding that she expected  to see her attired with gaiety and taste after which me condescended to shew Emily the splendour of her chateau and to point out the particular beauty or elegance which she thought distinguished each of her numerous suites of apartments She then withdrew to her toilet the throne of her homage and Emily to her chamber to unpack her books and to try to charm her mind by reading till the hour of dressing  When the company arrived Emily entered the saloon with an air of timidity which all her efforts could not overcome and which was increased by the consciousness of Madame Cheron's severe observation Her mourning dress the mild dejection of her beautiful countenance and the retiring diffidence of her manner rendered her a very interesting object to many of the company among whom she distinguished Signor Montoni and his friend Cavigni the late visitors at M Quesnel's who now seemed to converse with Madame Cheron with the familiarity of old acquaintance  and she to attend to them with particular pleasure  This Signor Montoni had an air of conscious superiority animated by spirit and strengthened by talents to which every person seemed involuntarily to yield The quickness of his perceptions was strikingly expressed on his countenance yet that countenance could submit implicitly to occasion and more than once in this day the triumph of art over nature might have been discerned in it His visage was long and rather narrow yet he was called handsome and it was perhaps the spirit and vigour of his soul sparkling through his features that triumphed for him Emily felt admiration but not the admiration that leads to esteem for it was mixed with a degree of fear she knew not exactly wherefore  Cavigni was gay and insinuating as formerly and though he paid almost incessant attention to Madame Cheron he found some opportunities of conversing with  Emily to whom he directed at first the fallies of his wit but now and then assumed an air of tenderness which she observed and shrunk from Though she replied but little the gentleness and sweetness of her manners encouraged him to talk and she felt relieved when a young lady of the party who spoke incessantly obtruded herself on his notice This lady who possessed all the sprightliness of a Frenchwoman with all her coquetry affected to understand every subject or rather there was no affectation in the case for never looking beyond the limits of her own ignorance she believed she had nothing to learn She attracted notice from all amused some disgusted others for a moment and was then forgotten  This day passed without any material occurrence and Emily though amused by the characters she had seen was glad when she could retire to the recollections which had acquired with her the character of duties  A fortnight passed in a round of dissipation and company and Emily who attended Madame Cheron in all her visits was sometimes entertained but oftener wearied She was struck by the apparent talents and knowledge displayed in the various conversations she listened to and it was long before she discovered that the talents were for the most part those of imposture and the knowledge nothing more than was necessary to assist them But what deceived her most was the air of constant gaiety and good spirits displayed by every visitor and which she supposed to arise from content as constant and from benevolence as ready At length from the overacting of some less accomplished than the others she could perceive that though contentment and benevolence are the only sure sources of cheerfulness the immoderate and feverish animation usually exhibited in large parties results partly from an insensibility to the cares which benevolence must sometimes derive from the sufferings of  others and partly from a desire to display the appearance of that prosperity which they know will command submission and attention to themselves  Emily's pleasantest hours were passed in the pavilion of the terrace to which she retired when she could steal from observation with a book to overcome or a lute to indulge her melancholy There as she sat with her eyes fixed on the fardistant Pyrenées and her thoughts on Valancourt and the beloved scenes of Gascony she would play the sweet and melancholy songs of her native provincethe popular songs she had listened to from her childhood  One evening having excused herself from accompanying her aunt abroad she thus withdrew to the pavilion with books and her lute It was the mild and beautiful evening of a sultry day and the windows which fronted the west opened upon all the glory of a setting sun Its rays illuminated with strong splendour the cliffs of the Pyrenées and touched their snowy tops  with a roseate hue that remained long after the sun had sunk below the horizon and the shades of twilight had stolen over the landscape Emily touched her lute with that fine melancholy expression which came from her heart The pensive hour and the scene the evening light on the Garonne that flowed at no great distance and whose waves as they passed towards La Vallée she often viewed with a sighthese united circumstances disposed her mind to tenderness and her thoughts were with Valancourt of whom she had heard nothing since her arrival at Tholouse and now that she was removed from him and in uncertainty she perceived all the interest he held in her heart Before she saw Valancourt she had never met a mind and taste so accordant with her own and though Madame Cheron told her much of the arts of dissimulation and that the elegance and propriety of thought which she so much admired in her lover were assumed for the purpose of pleasing her she could scarcely doubt their  truth This possibility however faint as it was was sufficient to harass her mind with anxiety and she found that few conditions are more painful than that of uncertainty as to the merit of a beloved object an uncertainty which she would not have suffered had her confidence in her own opinions been greater  She was awakened from her musing by the sound of horses' feet along a road that wound under the windows of the pavilion and a gentleman passed on horseback whose resemblance to Valancourt in air and figure for the twilight did not permit a view of his features immediately struck her She retired hastily from the lattice fearing to be seen yet wishing to observe further while the stranger passed on without looking up and when she returned to the lattice she saw him faintly through the twilight winding under the high trees that led to Tholouse This little incident so much disturbed her spirits that the temple and its scenery were no longer interesting to her  and after walking a while on the terrace she returned to the chateau  Madame Cheron whether she had seen a rival admired had lost at play or had witnessed an entertainment more splendid than her own was returned from her visit with a temper more than usually discomposed and Emily was glad when the hour arrived in which she could retire to the solitude of her own apartment  On the following morning she was summoned to Madame Cheron whose countenance was inflamed with resentment and as Emily advanced she held out a letter to her  "Do you know this hand" said she in a severe tone and with a look that was intended to search her heart while Emily examined the letter attentively and assured her that she did not  "Do not provoke me" said her aunt "you do know it confess the truth immediately I insist upon your confessing the truth instantly"  Emily was silent and turned to leave the room but Madame called her back "O you are guilty then" said she "you do know the hand" "If you was before in doubt of this madam" replied Emily calmly "why did you accuse me of having told a falsehood" Madame Cheron did not blush but her niece did a moment after when she heard the name of Valancourt It was not however with the consciousness of deserving reproof for if she ever had seen his handwriting the present characters did not bring it to her recollection  "It is useless to deny it" said Madame Cheron "I see in your countenance that you are no stranger to this letter and I dare say you have received many such from this impertinent young man without my knowledge in my own house"  Emily shocked at the indelicacy of this accusation still more than by the vulgarity of the former instantly forgot the pride that had imposed silence and endeavoured to  vindicate herself from the aspersion but Madame Cheron was not to be convinced  "I cannot suppose" she resumed "that this young man would have taken the liberty of writing to me if you had not encouraged him to do so and I must now""You will allow me to remind you madam" said Emily timidly "of some particulars of a conversation we had at La Vallée I then told you truly that I had only not forbade Monsieur Valancourt from addressing my family"  "I will not be interrupted" said Madame Cheron interrupting her niece "I was going to sayIIhave forgot what I was going to say But how happened it that you did not forbid him" Emily was silent "How happened it that you encouraged him to trouble me with this letterA young man that nobody knowsan utter stranger in the placea young adventurer no doubt who is looking out for a good fortune However on that point he has mistaken his aim"  "His family was known to my father" said Emily modestly and without appearing to be sensible of the last sentence  "O that is no recommendation at all" replied her aunt with her usual readiness upon this topic "he took such strange fanciès to people He was always judging persons by their countenances and was continually deceived" "Yet it was but now madam that you judged me guilty by my countenance" said Emily with a design of reproving Madame Cheron to which she was induced by this disrespectful mention of her father  "I called you here" resumed her aunt colouring "to tell you that I will not be disturbed in my own house by any letters or visits from young men who may take a fancy to flatter you This M de ValantineI think you call him has the impertinence to beg I will permit him to pay his respects to me I shall send him a proper answer And for you Emily I repeat it once for allif you are not contented to  conform to my directions and to my way of life I shall give up the task of overlooking your conductI shall no longer trouble myself with your education but shall send you to board in a convent"  "Dear madam" said Emily bursting into tears and overcome by the rude suspicions her aunt had expressed "how have I deserved these reproofs" She could say no more and so very fearful was she of acting with any degree of impropriety in the affair itself that at the present moment Madame Cheron might perhaps have prevailed with her to bind herself by a promise to renounce Valancourt for ever Her mind weakened by her terrors would no longer suffer her to view him as she had formerly done she feared the error of her own judgment not that of Madame Cheron and feared also that in her former conversation with him at La Vallée she had not conducted herself with sufficient reserve She knew that she did not deserve the coarse suspicions which her aunt had thrown out  but a thousand scruples rose to torment her such as would never have disturbed the peace of Madame Cheron Thus rendered anxious to avoid every opportunity of erring and willing to submit to any restrictions that her aunt should think proper she expressed an obedience to which Madame Cheron did not give much confidence and which she seemed to consider as the consequence of either fear or artifice  "Well then" said she "promise me that you will neither see this young man nor write to him without my consent""Dear madam" replied Emily "can you suppose I would do either unknown to you" "I don't know what to suppose there is no knowing how young women will act It is difficult to place any confidence in them for they have seldom sense enough to wish for the respect of the world"  "Alas madam" said Emily "I am anxious for my own respect my father taught me the value of that he said if I deserved  my own esteem that of the world would follow of course"  "My brother was a good kind of a man" replied Madame Cheron "but he did not know the world I am sure I have always felt a proper respect for myself yet" She stopped but she might have added that the world had not always shewn respect to her and this without impeaching its judgment  "Well" resumed Madame Cheron "you have not given me the promise though that I demand" Emily readily gave it and being then suffered to withdraw she walked in the garden tried to compose her spirits and at length arrived at her favourite pavilion at the end of the terrace where seating herself at one of the embowered windows that opened upon a balcony the stillness and seclusion of the scene allowed her to recollect her thoughts and to arrange them so as to form a clearer judgment of her former conduct She endeavoured to review with exactness all the  particulars of her conversation with Valancourt at La Vallée had the satisfaction to observe nothing that could alarm her delicate pride and thus to be confirmed in the selfesteem which was so necessary to her peace Her mind then became tranquil and she saw Valancourt amiable and intelligent as he had formerly appeared and Madame Cheron neither the one or the other The remembrance of her lover however brought with it many very painful emotions for it by no means reconciled her to the thought of resigning him and Madame Cheron having already shewn how highly she disapproved of the attachment she foresaw much suffering from the opposition of interests yet with all this was mingled a degree of delight which in spite of reason partook of hope She determined however that no consideration should induce her to permit a ciandestine correspondence and to observe in her conversation with Valancourt should they ever meet again the same nicety of reserve which had hitherto marked her  conduct As she repeated the words"should we ever meet again" she shrunk as if this was a circumstance which had never before occurred to her and tears came to her eyes which she hastily dried for she heard footsteps approaching and then the door of the pavilion open and on turning she sawValancourt An emotion of mingled pleasure surprise and apprehension pressed so suddenly upon her heart as almost to overcome her spirits the colour left her cheeks then returned brighter than before and she was for a moment unable to speak or to rise from her chair His countenance was the mirror in which she saw her own emotions reflected and it roused her to selfcommand The joy which had animated his features when he entered the pavilion was suddenly repressed as approaching he perceived her agitation and in a tremulous voice enquired after her health Recovered from her first surprise she answered him with a tempered smile but a variety of opposite emotions still assailed her heart and  struggled to subdue the mild dignity of her manner It was difficult to tell which predominatedthe joy of seeing Valancourt or the terror of her aunt's displeasure when she should hear of this meeting After some short and embarrassed conversation she led him into the gardens and enquired if he had seen Madame Cheron" "No" said he "I have not yet seen her for they told me she was engaged and as soon as I learned that you were in the gardens I came hither" He paused a moment in great agitation and then added "May I venture to tell you the purport of my visit without incurring your displeasure and to hope that you will not accuse me of precipitation in now availing myself of the permission you once gave me of addressing your family" Emily who knew not what to reply was spared from further perplexity and was sensible only of fear when on raising her eyes she saw Madame Cheron turn into the avenue As the consciousness of innocence returned this fear was so far dissipated  as to permit her to appear tranquil and instead of avoiding her aunt she advanced with Valancourt to meet her The look of haughty and impatient displeasure with which Madame Cheron regarded them made Emily shrink who understood from a single glance that this meeting was believed to have been more than accidental having mentioned Valancourt's name she became again too much agitated to remain with them and returned into the chateau where she awaited long in a state of trembling anxiety the conclusion of the conference She knew not how to account for Valancourt's visit to her aunt before he had received the permission he solicited since she was ignorant of a circumstance which would have rendered the request useless even if Madame Cheron had been inclined to grant it Valancourt in the agitation of his spirits had forgotten to date his letter so that it was impossible for Madame Cheron to return an answer and when he recollected this circumstance he was perhaps not so sorry for the omission  as glad of the excuse it allowed him for waiting on her before she could send a refusal  Madame Cheron had a long conversation with Valancourt and when she returned to the chateau her countenance expressed ill humour but not the degree of severity which Emily had apprehended "I have dismissed this young man at last" said she "and I hope my house will never again be disturbed with similar visits He assures me that your interview was not preconcerted"  "Dear madam" said Emily in extreme emotion "you surely did not ask him the question" "Most certainly I did you could not suppose I should be so imprudent as to neglect it"  "Good God" exclaimed Emily "what an opinion must he form of me since you Madam could express a suspicion of such ill conduct"  "It is of very little consequence what opinion he may form of you" replied her  aunt "for I have put an end to the affair but I believe he will not form a worse opinion of me for my prudent conduct I let him see that I was not to be trifled with and that I had more delicacy than to permit any clandestine correspondence to be carried on in my house"  Emily had frequently heard Madame Cheron use the word delicacy but she was now more than usually perplexed to understand how she meant to apply it in this instance in which her whole conduct appeared to merit the very reverse of the term  "It was very inconsiderate of my brother" resumed Madame Cheron "to leave the trouble of overlooking your conduct to me I wish you was well settled in life But if I find that I am to be further troubled with such visitors as this M Valancourt I shall place you in a convent at onceso remember the alternative This young man has the impertinence to own to mehe owns it that his fortune is very small and that he is chiefly dependent on an elder brother and  on the profession he has chosen He should have concealed these circumstances at least if he expected to succeed with me Had he the presumption to suppose I would marry my niece to a person such as he describes himself"  Emily dried her tears when she heard of the candid confession of Valancourt and though the circumstances it discovered were afflicting to her hopes his artless conduct gave her a degree of pleasure that overcame every other emotion But she was compelled even thus early in life to observe that good sense and noble integrity are not always sufficient to cope with folly and narrow cunning and her heart was pure enough to allow her even at this trying moment to look with more pride on the defeat of the former than with mortification on the conquests of the latter  Madame Cheron pursued her triumph"He has also thought proper to tell me that he will receive his dismission from no person but yourself this favour however  I have absolutely refused him He shall learn that it is quite sufficient that I disapprove him And I take this opportunity of repeatingthat if you concert any means of interview unknown to me you shall leave my house immediately"  "How little do you know me madam that you should think such an injunction necessary" said Emily trying to suppress her emotion "how little of the dear parents who educated me"  Madame Cheron now went to dress for an engagement which she had made for the evening and Emily who would gladly have been excused from attending her aunt did not ask to remain at home lest her request should be attributed to an improper motive When she retired to her own room the little fortitude which had supported her in the presence of her relation forsook her she remembered only that Valancourt whose character appeared more amiable from every circumstance that unfolded it was banished from her presence perhaps for ever and  she passed the time in weeping which according to her aunt's direction she ought to have employed in dressing This important duty was however quickly dispatched though when she joined Madame Cheron at table her eyes betrayed that she had been in tears and drew upon her a severe reproof  Her efforts to appear cheerful did not entirely fail when she joined the company at the house of Madame Clairval an elderly widow lady who had lately come to reside at Tholouse on an estate of her late husband She had lived many years at Paris in a splendid style had naturally a gay temper and since her residence at Tholouse had given some of the most magnificent entertainments that had been seen in that neighbourhood  These excited not only the envy but the trifling ambition of Madame Cheron who since she could not rival the splendour of her festivities was desirous of being ranked in the number of her most intimate friends For this purpose she paid her the most obsequious  sequious attention and made a point of being disengaged whenever she received an invitation from Madame Clairval of whom she talked wherever she went and derived much selfconsequence from impressing a belief on her general acquaintance that they were on the most familiar footing  The entertainments of this evening consisted of a ball and supper it was a fancy ball and the company danced in groups in the gardens which were very extensive The high and luxuriant trees under which the groups assembled were illuminated with a profusion of lamps disposed with taste and fancy The gay and various dresses of the company some of whom were seated on the turf conversing at their ease observing the cotillons taking refreshments and sometimes touching sportively a guitar the gallant manners of the gentlemen the exquisitely capricious air of the ladies the light fantastic steps of their dances the musicians with the lute the hautboy and the tabor seated at the foot of an elm and the  sylvan scenery of woods around were circumstances that unitedly formed a characteristic and striking picture of French festivity Emily surveyed the gaiety of the scene with a melancholy kind of pleasure and her emotion may be imagined when as she stood with her aunt looking at one of the groups she perceived Valancourt saw him dancing with a young and beautiful lady saw him conversing with her with a mixture of attention and familiarity such as she had seldom observed in his manner She turned hastily from the scene and attempted to draw away Madame Cheron who was conversing with Signor Cavigni and neither perceived Valancourt or was willing to be interrupted A faintness suddenly came over Emily and unable to support herself she sat down on a turf bank beneath the trees where several other persons were seated One of these observing the extreme paleness of her countenance enquired if she was ill and begged she would allow him to fetch her a glass of water for which  politeness she thanked him but did not accept it Her apprehension lest Valancourt should observe her emotion made her anxious to overcome it and she succeeded so far as to recompose her countenance Madame Cheron was still conversing with Cavigni and the Count Bauvillers who had addressed Emily made some observations upon the scene to which she answered almost unconsciously for her mind was still occupied with the idea of Valancourt to whom it was with extreme uneasiness that she remained so near Some remarks however which the Count made upon the dance obliged her to turn her eyes towards it and at that moment Valancourt's met hers Her colour faded again she felt that she was relapsing into faintness and instantly averted her looks but not before she had observed the altered countenance of Valancourt on perceiving her She would have left the spot immediately had she not been conscious that this conduct would have shewn him more obviously the interest he held in  her heart and having tried to attend to the Count's conversation and to join in it she at length recovered her spirits But when he made some observation on Valancourt's partner the fear of shewing that she was interested in the remark would have betrayed it to him had not the Count while he spoke looked towards the person of whom he was speaking "The lady" said he "dancing with that young chevalier who appears to be accomplished in every thing but in dancing is ranked among the beauties of Tholouse She is handsome and her fortune will be very large I hope she will make a better choice in a partner for life than she has done in a partner for the dance for I observe he has just put the set into great confusion he does nothing but commit blunders I am surprised that with his air and figure he has not taken more care to accomplish himself in dancing"  Emily whose heart trembled at every word that was now uttered endeavoured to  turn the conversation from Valancourt by enquiring the name of the lady with whom he danced but before the Count could reply the dance concluded and Emily perceiving that Valancourt was coming towards her rose and joined Madame Cheron  "Here is the Chevalier Valancourt madam" said she in a whisper "pray let us go" Her aunt immediately moved on but not before Valancourt had reached them who bowed lowly to Madame Cheron and with an earnest and dejected look to Emily with whom notwithstanding all her effort an air of more than common reserve prevailed The presence of Madame Cheron prevented Valancourt from remaining and he passed on with a countenance whose melancholy reproached her for having increased it Emily was called from the musing fit into which he had fallen by the Count Bauvillers who was known to her aunt  "I have your pardon to beg ma'amselle" said he "for a rudeness which you will readily believe was quite unintentional I  did not know that the Chevalier was your acquaintance when I so freely criticised his dancing" Emily blushed and smiled and Madame Cheron spared her the difficulty of replying "If you mean the person who has just passed us" said she "I can assure you he is no acquaintance of either mine or ma'amselle St Aubert's I know nothing of him"  "O that is the chevalier Valancourt" said Cavigni carelessly and looking back "You know him then" said Madame Cheron "I am not acquainted with him" replied Cavigni "You don't know then the reason I have to call him impertinenthe as had the presumption to admire my niece"  "If every man deserves the title of impertinent who admires ma'amselle St Aubert "replied Cavigni "I fear there are a great many impertinents and I am willing to acknowledge myself one of the number"  "O signor" said Madame Cheron with an affected smile "I perceive you have  learnt the art of complimenting since you came into France But it is cruel to compliment children since they mistake flattery for truth"  Cavigni turned away his face for a moment and then said with a studied air "Whom then are we to compliment madam for it would be absurd to compliment a woman of refined understanding  she  is above all praise" As he finished the sentence he gave Emily a sly look and the smile that had lurked in his eye stole forth She perfectly understood it and blushed for Madame Cheron who replied "You are perfectly right signor no woman of understanding can endure compliment"  "I have heard signor Montoni say" rejoined Cavigni "that he never knew but one woman who deserved it"  "Well" exclaimed Madame Cheron with a short laugh and a smile of unutterable complacency "and who could she be"  "O" replied Cavigni "it is impossible to mistake her for certainly there is not  more than one woman in the world who has both the merit to deserve compliment and the wit to refuse it Most women reverse the case entirely" He looked again at Emily who blushed deeper than before for her aunt and turned from him with displeasure  "Well signor" said Madame Cheron "I protest you are a Frenchman I never heard a foreigner say any thing half so gallant as that"  "True madam" said the Count who had been some time silent and with a low bow "but the gallantry of the compliment had been utterly lost but for the ingenuity that discovered the application"  Madame Cheron did not perceive the meaning of this too satirical sentence and she therefore escaped the pain which Emily felt on her account "O here comes signor Montoni himself" said her aunt "I protest I will tell him all the fine things you have been saying to me" The signor however passed at this moment into another  walk "Pray who is it that has so much engaged your friend this evening" asked Madame Cheron with an air of chagrin "I have not seen him once"  "He hid a very particular engagement with the Marquis I a Rivière" replied Cavigni "which has detained him I perceive till this moment or he would have done himself the honour of paying his respects to you madam sooner as he commissioned me to say But I know not how it isyour conversation is so fascinatingthat it can charm even memory I think or I should certainly have delivered my friend's apology before"  "The apology fir would have been more satisfactory from himself" said Madame Cheron whose vanity was more mortified by Montoni's neglect than flattered by Cavigni's compliment Her manner at this moment and Cavigni's late conversation now awakened a suspicion inEmily's mind which notwithstanding that some recollections served to confirm it appeared preposterous  She thought she perceived that Montoni was paying serious addresses to her aunt and that she not only accepted them but was jealously watchful of any appearance of neglect on his partThat Madame Cheron at her years should elect a second husband was ridiculous though her vanity made it not impossible but that Montoni with his discernment his figure and pretensions should make a choice of Madame Cheronappeared most wonderful Her thoughts however did not dwell long on the subject nearer interests pressed upon them Valancourt rejected of her aunt and Valancourt dancing with a gay and beautiful partner alternately tormented her mind As she passed along the gardens she looked timidly forward half fearing and half hoping that he might appear in the crowd and the disappointment she felt on not seeing him told her that she had hoped more than she had feared  Montoni soon after joined the party He muttered over some short speech about  regret for having been so long detained elsewhere when he knew he should have the pleasure of seeing Madame Cheron here and she receiving the apology with the air of a pettish girl addressed herself entirely to Cavigni who looked archly at Montoni as if he would have said "I will not triumph over you too much I will have the goodness to bear my honours meekly but look sharp signor or I shall certainly run away with your prize"  The supper was served in different pavilions in the gardens as well as in one large saloon of the chateau and with more of taste than either of splendour or even of plenty Madame Cheron and her party supped with Madame Clairval in the saloon and Emily with difficulty disguised her emotion when she saw Valancourt placed at the same table with herself There Madame Cheron having surveyed him with high displeasure said to some person who sat next to her "Pray who  is  that young man" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt" was the answer "Yes I am not ignorant  of his name but who is this Chevalier Valancourt that thus intrudes himself at this table" The attention of the person to whom she spoke was called off before she received a second reply The table at which they sat was very long and Valancourt being seated with his partner near the bottom and Emily near the top the distance between them may account for his not immediately perceiving her She avoided looking to that end of the table but whenever her eyes happened to glance towards it she observed him conversing with his beautiful companion and the observation did not contribute to restore her peace any more than the accounts she heard of the fortune and accomplishments of this same lady  Madame Cheron to whom these remarks were sometimes addressed because they supported topics for trivial conversation seemed indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate Valancourt towards whom she felt all the petty resentment of a narrow pride "I  admire the lady" said she "but I must condemn her choice of a partner" "Oh the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the most accomplished young men we have" replied the lady to whom this remark was addressed "it is whispered that Mademoiselle D'Emery and her very large fortune are to be his"  "Impossible" exclaimed Madame Cheron reddening with vexation" it is impossible that she can be so destitute of taste he has so little the air of a person of condition that if I did not see him at the table of Madame Clairval I should never have suspected him to be one I have besides particular reasons for believing the report to be erroneous"  "I cannot doubt the truth of it" replied the lady gravely disgusted by the abrupt contradiction she had received concerning her opinion of Valancourt's merit "You will perhaps doubt it" said Madame Cheron "when I assure you that it was only this morning that I rejected his suit"  This was said without any intention of imposing the meaning it conveyed but simply from a habit of considering herself to be the most important person in every affair that concerned her niece and because literally she had rejected Valancourt "Your reasons are indeed such as cannot be doubted" replied the lady with an ironical smile"Any more than the discernment of the Chevalier Valancourt" added Cavigni who stood by the chair of Madame Cheron and had heard her arrogate to herself as he thought a distinction which had been paid to her niece "His discernment  may  be justly questioned signor" said Madame Cheron who was not flattered by what she understood to be an encomium upon Emily  "Alas" exclaimed Cavigni surveying Madame Cheron with affected ecstasy "how vain is that assertion while that facethat shapethat aircombine to refute it Unhappy Valancourt his discernment has been his destruction"  Emily looked surprised and embarrassed the lady who had lately spoken astonished  and Madame Cheron who though she did not perfectly understand this speech was very ready to believe herself complimented by it said smilingly "O Signor you are very gallant but those who hear you vindicate the chevalier's discernment will suppose that I am the object of it"  "They cannot doubt it" replied Cavigni bowing low  "And would not that be very mortifying Signor"  "Unquestionably it would" said Cavigni  "I cannot endure the thought" said Madame Cheron  "It is not to be endured" replied Cavigni  "What can be done to prevent so humiliating a mistake" rejoined Madame Cheron  "Alas I cannot assist you" replied Cavigni with a deliberating air "Your only chance of refuting the calumny and of making people understand what you wish  them to believe is to persist in your first assertion for when they are told of the chevalier's want of discernment it is possible they may suppose he never presumed to distress you with his admirationBut then againthat diffidence which renders you so insensible to your own perfectionsthey will consider this and Valancourt's taste will not be doubted though you arraign it In short they will in spite of your endeavours continue to believe what might very naturally have occurred to them without any hint of minethat the chevalier has taste enough to admire a beautiful woman"  "All this is very distressing" said Madame Cheron with a profound sigh  "May I be allowed to ask what is so distressing" said Madame Clairval who was struck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent with which this was delivered  "It is a delicate subject" replied Madame Cheron "a very mortifying one to me" "I am concerned to hear it" said Madame  dame Clairval "I hope nothing has occurred this evening particularly to distress you" "Alas yes within this half hour and I know not where the report may endmy pride was never so shocked before but I assure yon the report is totally void of foundation" "Good God" exclaimed Madame Clairval "what can be done Can you point out any way by which I can assist or console you"  "The only way by which you can do either" replied Madame Cheron "is to contradict the report wherever you go"  "Well but pray inform me what I am to contradict"  "It is so very humiliating that I know not how to mention it" continued Madame Cheron "but you shall judge Do you observe that young man seated near the bottom of the table who is conversing with Mademoiselle D'Emery" "Yes I perceive whom you mean" "You observe how little he has the air of a person of condition I was saying just now that I should  not have thought him a gentleman if I had not seen him at this table" "Well but the report" said Madame Clairva "let me understand the subject of your distress" "Ah the subject of my distress" replied Madame Cheron "this person whom nobody knowsI beg pardon madam I did not consider what I saidthis impertinent young man having had the presumption to address my niece has I fear given rise to a report that he had declared himself my admirer Now only consider how very mortifying such a report must be You I know will feel for my situation A woman of my conditionthink how degrading even the rumour of such an alliance must be"  "Degrading indeed my poor friend" said Madame Clairval "You may rely upon it I will contradict the report wherever I go" as she said which she turned her attention upon another part of the company and Cavigni who had hitherto appeared a grave spectator of the scene now fearing  he should be unable to smother the laugh that convulsed him walked abruptly away  "I perceive you do not know" said the lady who sat near Madame Cheron "that the gentleman you have been speaking of is Madame Clairval's nephew" "Impossible" exclaimed Madame Cheron who now began to perceive that she had been totally mistaken in her judgment of Valancourt and to praise him aloud with as much servility as she had before censured him with frivolous malignity  Emily who during the greater part of this conversation had been so absorbed in thought as to be spared the pain of hearing it was now extremely surprised by her aunt's praise of Valancourt with whose relationship to Madame Clairval she was unacquainted but she was not sorry when Madame Cheron who though she now tried to appear unconcerned was really much embarrassed prepared to withdraw immediately after supper Montoni then came to hand Madame Cheron to her carriage and Cavigni with an arch solemnity of countenance  nance followed with Emily who as she wished them good night and drew up the glass saw Valancourt among the crowd at the gates Before the carriage drove off he disappeared Madame Cheron forbore to mention him to Emily and as soon as they reached the chateau they separated for the night  On the following morning as Emily sat at breakfast with her aunt a letter was brought to her of which she knew the handwriting upon the cover and as she received it with a trembling hand Madame Cheron hastily enquired from whom it came Emily with her leave broke the seal and observing the signature of Valancourt gave it unread to her aunt who received it with impatience and as she looked it over Emily endeavoured to read on her countenance its contents Having returned the letter to her niece whose eyes asked if she might examine it "Yes read it child" said Madame Cheron in a manner less severe than she had expected  and Emily had perhaps never before so willingly obeyed her aunt In this letter Valancourt said little of the interview of the preceding day but concluded with declaring that he would accept his dismission from Emily only and with entreating that she would allow him to wait upon her on the approaching evening When she read this she was astonished at the moderation of Madame Cheron and looked at her with timid expectation as she said sorrowfully"What am I to say madam"  "Whywe must see the young man I believe" replied her aunt "and hear what he has further to say for himself You may tell him he may come" Emily dared scarcely credit what she heard "Yet stay" added Madame Cheron "I will tell him so myself" She called for pen and ink Emily still not daring to trust the emotions she felt and almost sinking beneath them Her surprise would have been less had she overheard on the preceding evening what Madame Cheron had not forgottenthat  Valancourt was the nephew of Madame Clairval  "What were the "particulars of her aunt's note Emily did not learn but the result was a visit from Valancourt in the evening whom Madame Cheron received alone and they had a long conversation before Emily was called down When she entered the room her aunt was conversing with complacency and she saw the eyes of Valancourt as he impatiently rose animated with hope  "We have been talking over this affair" said Madame Cheron" the chevalier has been telling me that the late Monsieur Clairval was the brother of the Countess de Duvarney his mother I only wish he had mentioned his relationship to Madame Clairval before I certainly should have considered that circumstance as a sufficient introduction to my house" Valancourt bowed and was going to address Emily but her aunt prevented him "I have therefore consented that you shall receive his visits and though I will not bind  myself by any promise or say that I shall consider him as my nephew yet I shall permit the intercourse and shall look forward to any further connection as an event which may possibly take place in a course of years provided the chevalier rises in his profession or any circumstance occurs which may make it prudent for him to take a wife But Mons Valancourt will observe and you too Emily that till that happens I positively forbid any thoughts of marrying"  Emily's countenance during this coarse speech varied every instant and towards its conclusion her distress had so much increased that she was on the point of leaving the room Valancourt meanwhile scarcely less embarrassed did not dare to look at her for whom he was thus distressed but when Madame Cheron was silent he said "Flattering madam as your approbation is to mehighly as I am honoured by itI have yet so much to fear that I scarcely dare to hope" "Pray sir explain yourself"  self" said Madame Cheron an unexpected requisition which embarrassed Valancourt again and almost overcame him with confusion at circumstances on which had he been only a spectator of the scene he would have smiled  "Till I receive Mademoiselle St Aubert's permission to accept your indulgence" said he falteringly" till she allows me to hope"  "O is that all" interrupted Madame Cheron "Well I will take upon me to answer for her But at the same time sir give me leave to observe to you that I am her guardian and that I expect in every instance that my will is hers"  As she said this she rose and quitted the room leaving Emily and Valancourt in a state of mutual embarrassment and when Valancourt's hopes enabled him to overcome his fears and to address her with the zeal and sincerity so natural to him it was a considerable time before she was susficiently  recovered to hear with distinctness his solicitations and enquiries  The conduct of Madame Cheron in this affair had been entirely governed by selfish vanity Valancourt in his first interview had with great candour laid open to her the true state of his present circumstances and his future expectancies and she with more prudence than humanity had absolutely and abruptly rejected his suit She wished her niece to marry ambitiously not because she desired to see her in possession of the happiness which rank and wealth are usually believed to bestow but because she desired to partake the importance which such an alliance would give When therefore she discovered that Valancourt was the nephew of a person of so much consequence as Madame Clairval she became anxious for the connection since the prospect it afforded of future fortune and distinction for Emily promised the exaltation she coveted for herself Her calculations concerning fortune in this alliance  were guided rather by her wishes than by any hint of Valancourt or strong appearance of probability and when she rested her expectation on the wealth of Madame Clairval she seemed totally to have forgotten that the latter had a daughter Valancourt however had not forgotten this circumstance and the consideration of it had made him so modest in his expectations from Madame Clairval that he had not even named the relationship in his first conversation with Madame Cheron But whatever might be the future fortune of Emily the present distinction which the connection would afford for herself was certain since the splendour of Madame Clairval's establishment was such as to excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood Thus had she consented to involve her niece in an engagement to which she saw only a distant and uncertain conclusion with as little consideration of her happiness as when she had so precipitately forbade it for though she herself possessed  the means of rendering this union not only certain but prudent yet to do so was no part of her present intention  From this period Valancourt made frequent visits to Madame Cheron and Emily passed in his society the happiest hours she had known since the death of her father They were both too much engaged by the present moments to give serious consideration to the future They loved and were beloved and saw not that the very attachment which formed the delight of their present days might possibly occasion the sufferings of years Meanwhile Madame Cheron's intercourse with Madame Clairval became more frequent than before and her vanity was already gratified by the opportunity of proclaiming wherever she went the attachment that subsisted between their nephew and niece  Montoni was now also become a daily guest at the chateau and Emily was compelled to observe that he really was a fuitor and a favoured suitor to her aunt  Thus passed the winter months not only in peace but in happiness to Valancourt and Emily the station of his regiment being so near Tholouse as to allow this frequent intercourse The pavilion on the terrace was the favourite scene of their interviews and there Emily with Madame Cheron would work while Valancourt read aloud works of genius and taste listened to her enthusiasm expressed his own and caught new opportunities of observing that their minds were formed to constitute the happiness of each other the same taste the same noble and benevolent sentiments animating each  CHAP XIV  As when a

length yielded to her vanity Some very splendid entertainments which Madame Clairval had given and the general adulation which was paid her made the former more anxious than before to secure an alliance that would so much exalt her in her own opinion and in that of the world She proposed terms for the immediate marriage of her niece  and offered to give Emily a dower provided Madame Clairval observed equal terms on the part of her nephew Madame Clairval listened to the proposal and considering that Emily was the apparent heiress of her aunt's wealth accepted it Meanwhile Emily knew nothing of the transaction till Madame Cheron informed her that she must make preparation for the nuptials which would be celebrated without further delay then astonished and wholly unable to account for this sudden conclusion which Valancourt had not solicited for he was ignorant of what had passed between the elder ladies and had not dared to hope such good fortune she decisively objected to it Madame Cheron however quite as jealous of contradiction now as she had been formerly contended for a speedy marriage with as much vehemence as she had formerly opposed whatever had the most remote possibility of leading to it and Emily's scruples disappeared when she again saw Valancourt who was now informed of the happiness designed  signed for him and came to claim a promise of it from herself  While preparations were making for these nuptials Montoni became the acknowledged lover of Madame Cheron and though Madame Clairval was much displeased when she heard of the approaching connection and was willing to prevent that of Valancourt with Emily her conscience told her that she had no right thus to trifle with their peace and Madame Clairval though a woman of fashion was far less advanced than her friend in the art of deriving satisfaction from distinction and admiration rather than from conscience  Emily observed with concern the ascendancy which Montoni had acquired over Madame Cheron as well as the increasing frequency of his visits and her own opinion of this Italian was confirmed by that of Valancourt who had always expressed a dislike of him As she was one morning sitting at work in the pavilion enjoying the pleasant freshness of spring whose colours were  now spread upon the landscape and listening to Valancourt who was reading but who often laid aside the book to converse she received a summons to attend Madame Cheron immediately and had scarcely entered the dressingroom when she observed with surprise the dejection of her aunt's countenance and the contrasted gaiety of her dress "So niece"said Madame and she stopped under some degree of embarrassment"I sent for youII wished to see you I have news to tell you From this hour you must consider the signor Montoni as your unclewe were married this morning"  Astonishednot so much at the marriage as at the secrecy with which it had been concluded and the agitation with which it was announced Emily at length attributed the privacy to the wish of Montoni rather than of her aunt His wife however intended that the contrary should be believed and therefore added "You see I wished to avoid a bustle but now the ceremony is  over I shall do so no longer and I wish to announce to my servants that they must receive the signor Montoni for their master" Emily made a feeble attempt to congratulate her on these apparently imprudent nuptials "I shall now celebrate my marriage with some splendour" continued Madame Montoni "and to save time I shall avail myself of the preparation that has been made for yours which will of course be delayed a little while Such of your wedding clothes as are ready I shall expect you will appear in to do honour to this festival I also wish you to inform Monsieur Valancourt that I have changed my name and he will acquaint Madame Clairval In a few days I shall give a grand entertainment at which I shall request their presence"  Emily was so lost in surprise and various thought that she made Madame Montoni scarcely any reply but at her desire she returned to inform Valancourt of what had passed Surprise was not his predominant emotion on hearing of these hasty nuptials  and when he learned that they were to be the means of delaying his own and that the very ornaments of the chateau which had been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his Emily were to be degraded to the celebration of Madame Montoni's grief and indignation agitated him alternately He could conceal neither from the observation of Emily whose efforts to abstract him from these serious emotions and to laugh at the apprehensive considerations that assailed him were ineffectual and when at length he took leave there was an earnest tenderness in his manner that extremely affected her she even shed tears when he disappeared at the end of the terrace yet knew not exactly why she should do so  Montoni now took possession of the chateau and the command of its inhabitants with the ease of a man who had long considered it to be his own His friend Cavigni who had been extremely serviceable in having paid Madame Cheron the attention and flattery which she required but from which  Montoni too often revolted had apartments assigned to him and received from the domestics an equal degree of obedience with the master of the mansion  Within a few days Madame Montoni as she had promised gave a magnificent entertainment to a very numerous company among whom was Valancourt but at which Madame Clairval excused herself from attending There was a concert ball and supper Valancourt was of course Emily's partner and though when he gave a look to the decorations of the apartments he could not but remember that they were designed for other festivities than those they now contributed to celebrate he endeavoured to check his concern by considering that a little while only would elapse before they would be given to their original destination During this evening Madame Montoni danced laughed and talked incessantly while Montoni silent reserved and somewhat haughty seemed weary of the parade  and of the frivolous company it had drawn together  This was the first and the last entertainment given in celebration of their nuptials Montoni though the severity of his temper and the gloominess of his pride prevented him from enjoying such festivities was extremely willing to promote them It was seldom that he could meet in any company a man of more address and still seldomer one of more understanding than himself the balance of advantage in such parties or in the connections which might arise from them must therefore be on his side and knowing as he did the selfish purposes for which they are generally frequented he had no objection to measure his talents of dissimulation with those of any other competitor for distinction and plunder But his wife who when her own interest was immediately concerned had sometimes more discernment than vanity acquired a consciousness of her inferiority to other women in personal attractions which uniting with the jealousy  natural to the discovery counteracted his readiness for mingling with all the parties Tholouse could afford Till she had as she supposed the affections of an husband to lose she had no motive for discovering the unwelcome truth and it had never obtruded itself upon her but now that it influenced her policy she opposed her husband's inclination for company with the more eagerness because she believed him to be really as well received in the female society of the place as during his addresses to her he had affected to be  A few weeks only had elapsed since the marriage when Madame Montoni informed Emily that the signor intended to return to Italy as soon as the necessary preparation could be made for so long a journey "We shall go to Venice" said she "where the signor has a fine mansion and from thence to his estate in Tuscany Why do you look so grave childYou who are so fond of a romantic country and fine views will doubtless be delighted with this journey"  "Am I then to be of the party madam" said Emily with extreme surprise and emotion "Most certainly" replied her aunt "how could you imagine we should leave you behind But I see you are thinking of the Chevalier he is not yet I believe informed of the journey but he very soon will be so Signor Montoni is gone to acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey and to say that the proposed connection between the families must from this time be thought of no more"  The unfeeling manner in which Madame Montoni thus informed her niece that she must be separated perhaps for ever from the man with whom she was on the point of being united for life added to the dismay which she must otherwise have suffered at such intelligence When she could speak she asked the cause of the sudden change in Madame's sentiments towards Valancourt but the only reply she could obtain was that the Signor had forbade the connection  considering it to be greatly inferior to what Emily might reasonably expect  "I now leave the affair entirely to the Signor" added Madame Montoni "but I must say that M Valancourt never was a favourite with me and I was overpersuaded or I should not have given my consent to the connection I was weak enoughI am so foolish sometimesto suffer other people's uneasiness to affect me and so my better judgment yielded to your affliction But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this and he shall not have to reprove me a second time I am determined that you shall submit to those who know how to guide you better than yourselfI am determined that you shall be conformable"  Emily would have been astonished at the assertions of this eloquent speech had not her mind been so overwhelmed by the sudden shock it had received that she scarcely heard a word of what was latterly addressed to her Whatever were the weaknesses of Madame Montoni she might have avoided  to accuse herself with those of compassion and tenderness to the feelings of others and especially to those of Emily It was the same ambition that lately prevailed upon her to solicit an alliance with Madame Clairval's family which induced her to withdraw from it now that her marriage with Montoni had exalted her selfconsequence and with it her views for her niece  Emily was at this time too much affected to employ either remonstrance or entreaty on this topic and when at length she attempted the latter her emotion overcame her speech and she retired to her apartment to think if in the present state of her mind to think was possible upon this sudden and overwhelming subject It was very long before her spirits were sufficiently composed to permit the reflection which when it came was dark and even terrible She saw that Montoni sought to aggrandise himself in his disposal of her and it occurred that his friend Cavigni was the person for  whom he was interested The prospect of going to Italy was still rendered darker when she considered the tumultuous situation of that country then torn by civil commotion where every petty state was at war with its neighbour and even every castle liable to the attack of an invader She considered the person to whose immediate guidance she would be committed and the vast distance that was to separate her from Valancourt and at the recollection of him every other image vanished from her mind and every thought was again obscured by grief  In this perturbed state she passed some hours and when she was summoned to dinner she entreated permission to remain in her own apartment but Madame Montoni was alone and the request was refused Emily and her aunt said little during the repast the one occupied by her griefs the otherengrossed by the disappointment which the unexpected absence of Montoni occasioned for not only was her vanity piqued by the neglect but her jealousy alarmed by  what she considered as a mysterious engagement When the cloth was drawn and they were alone Emily renewed the mention of Valancourt but her aunt neither softened to pity or awakened to remorse became enraged that her will should be opposed and the authority of Montoni questioned though this was done by Emily with her usual gentleness who after a long and torturing conversation retired in tears  As she crossed the hall a person entered it by the great door whom as her eyes hastily glanced that way she imagined to be Montoni and she was passing on with quicker steps when she heard the wellknown voice of Valancourt  "Emily O my Emily" cried he in a tone faltering with impatience while she turned and as he advanced was alarmed at the expression of his countenance and the eager desperation of his air "In tears Emily I would speak with you" said he "I have much to say conduct me where we  may converse But you trembleyou are ill Let me lead you to a seat"  He observed the open door of an apartment and hastily took her hand to lead her thither but she attempted to withdraw it and said with a languid smile "I am better already if you wish to see my aunt she is in the diningparlour" "I must speak with  you  my Emily" replied Valancourt "Good God is it already come to this Are you indeed so willing to resign me But this is an improper placeI am overheard Let me entreat your attention if only for a few minutes" "When you have seen my aunt" said Emily "I was wretched enough when I came hither" exclaimed Valancourt "do not increase my misery by this coldnessthis cruel refusal"  The despondency with which he spoke this affected her almost to tears but she persisted in refusing to hear him till he had conversed with Madame Montoni "Where is her husband where then is Montoni"  said Valancourt in an altered tone "it is he to whom I must speak"  Emily terrified for the consequence of the indignation that flashed in his eyes tremblingly assured him that Montoni was at home and entreated he would endeavour to moderate his resentment At the tremulous accents of her voice his eyes softened instantly from wildness into tenderness "You are ill Emily" said he "they will destroy us both Forgive me that I dared to doubt your affection"  Emily no longer opposed him as he led her into an adjoining parlour the manner in which he had named Montoni had so much alarmed her for his own safety that she was now only anxious to "prevent the consequences of his just resentment He listened to her entreaties with attention but replied to them only with looks of despondency and tenderness concealing as much as possible the sentiments he felt toward Morrtoni that he might sooth the apprehensions which distressed her But she saw the veil he had  spread over his resentment and his assumed tranquillity only alarming her more she urged at length the impolicy of forcing an interview with Montoni and of taking any measure which might render their separation irremediable Valancourt yielded to these remonstrances and her affecting entreaties drew from him a promise that however Montoni might persist in his design of disuniting them he would not seek to redress his wrongs by violence "For my sake" said Emily "let the consideration of what I should suffer deter you from such a mode of revenge" "For your sake Emily" replied Valancourt his eyes filling with tears of tenderness and grief while he gazed upon her "YesyesI shall subdue myself But though I have given you my solemn promise to do this do not expect that I can tamely submit to the authority or Montoni if I could I should be unworthy of you Yet O Emily how long may he condemn me to live without you  how long may it be before you return to France"  Emily endeavoured to sooth him with assurances of her unalterable affection and by representing that in little more than a year she should be her own mistress as far as related to her aunt from whose guardianship her age would then release her assurances which gave little consolation to Valancourt who considered that she would then be in Italy and in the power of those whose dominion over her would not cease with their rights but he affected to be consoled by them Emily comforted by the promise she had obtained and by his apparent composure was about to leave him when her aunt entered the room She threw a glance of sharp reproof upon her niece who immediately withdrew and of haughty displeasure upon Valancourt  "This is not the conduct I should have expected from you sir" said she "I did not expect to see you in my house after you had been informed that your visits  were no longer agreeable much less that you would seek a clandestine interview with my niece and that she would grant one"  Valancourt perceiving it necessary to vindicate Emily from such a design explained that the purpose of his own visit had been to request an interview with Montoni and he then entered upon the subject of it with the tempered spirit which the sex rather than the respectability of Madame Montoni demanded  His expostulations were answered with severe rebuke she lamented again that her prudence had ever yielded to what she termed compassion and added that she was so sensible of the folly of her former consent that to prevent the possibility of a repetition she had committed the affair entirely to the conduct of Signor Montoni  The feeling eloquence of Valancourt however at length made her sensible in some measure of her unworthy conduct and she became susceptible to shame but not to remorse she hated Valancourt who awakened her to this painful sensation and in proportion as she  grew dissatisfied with herself her abhorrence of him increased This was also the more inveterate because his tempered words and manner were such as without accusing her compelled her to accuse herself and neither left her a hope that the odious portrait was the caricature of his prejudice or afforded her an excuse for expressing the violent resentment with which she contemplated it At length her anger rose to such an height that Valancourt was compelled to leave the house abruptly lest he should forfeit his own esteem by an intemperate reply He was then convinced that from Madame Montoni he had nothing to hope for what of either pity or justice could be expected from a person who could feel the pain of guilt without the humility of repentance  To Montoni he looked with equal despondency since it was nearly evident that this plan of separation originated with him and it was not probable that he would relinquish his own views to entreaties or remonstrances which he must have foreseen  and have been prepared to resist Yet remembering his promise to Emily and more solicitous concerning his love than jealous of his consequence Valancourt was careful to do nothing that might unnecessarily irritate Montoni he wrote to him therefore not to demand an interview but to solicit one and having done this he endeavoured to await with calmness his reply  Madame Clairval was passive in the affair When she gave her approbation to Valancourt's marriage it was in the belief that Emily would be the heiress of Madame Montoni's fortune and though upon the nuptials of the latter when she perceived the fallacy of this expectation her conscience had withheld her from adopting any measure to prevent the union her benevolence was not sufficiently active to impel her towards any step that might now promote it She was on the contrary secretly pleased that Valancourt was released from an engagement which she considered to be as inferior  in point of fortune to his merit as his alliance was thought by Montoni to be humiliating to the beauty of Emily and though her pride was wounded by this rejection of a member of her family she disdained to shew resentment otherwise than by silence  Montoni in his reply to Valancourt said that as an interview could neither remove the objections of the one or overcome the wishes of the other it would serve only to produce useless altercation between them He therefore thought proper to refuse it  In consideration of the policy suggested by Emily and of his promise to her Valancourt restrained the impulse that urged him to the house of Montoni to demand what had been denied to his entreaties He only repeated his solicitations to see him seconding them with all the arguments his situation could suggest Thus several days passed in remonstrance on one side and inflexible denial on the other for whether it was fear or shame or the  hatred which results from both that made Montoni shun the man he had injured he was peremptory in his refusal and was neither softened to pity by the agony which Valancourt's letters pourtrayed or awakened to a repentance of his own injustice by the strong remonstrances he employed At length Valancourt's letters were returned unopened and then in the first moments of passionate despair he forgot every promise to Emily except the solemn one which bound him to avoid violence and hastened to Montoni's chateau determined to see him by whatever other means might be necessary Montoni was denied and Valancourt when he afterwards enquired for Madame and Ma'amselle St Aubert was absolutely refused admittance by the servants Not choosing to submit himself to a contest with these he at length departed and returning home in a state of mind approaching to frenzy wrote to Emily of what had passed expressed without restraint all the agony of his heart and entreated that since he must not  otherwise hope to see her immediately she would allow him an interview unknown to Montoni Soon after he had dispatched this his passions becoming more temperate he was sensible of the error he had committed in having given Emily new subject of distress in the strong mention of his own suffering and would have given half the world had it been his to recover the letter Emily however was spared the pain she must have received from it by the suspicious policy of Madame Montoni who had ordered that all letters addressed to her niece should be delivered to herself and who after having perused this and indulged the expressions of resentment which Valancourt's mention of Montoni provoked had consigned it to the flames  Montoni meanwhile every day more impatient to leave France gave repeated orders for dispatch to the servants employed in preparations for the journey and to the persons with whom he was transacting some particular business He preserved a steady  silence to the letters in which Valancourt despairing of greater good and having subdued the passion that had transgressed against his policy solicited only the indulgence of being allowed to bid Emily farewell But when the latter learned that she was really to set out in a very few days and that it was designed he should see her no more forgetting every consideration of prudence he dared in a second letter to Emily to propose a clandestine marriage This also was transmitted to Madame Montoni and the last day of Emily's stay at Tholouse arrived without affording Valancourt even a line to sooth his sufferings or a hope that he should be allowed a parting interview  During this period of torturing suspense to Valancourt Emily was sunk into that kind of stupor with which sudden and irremediable misfortune sometimes overwhelms the mind Loving him with the tenderest affection and having long been accustomed to consider him as the friend  and companion of all her future days she had no ideas of happiness that were not connected with him What then must have been her suffering when thus suddenly they were to be separated perhaps for ever certainly to be thrown into distant parts of the world where they could scarcely hear of each other's existence and all this in obedience to the will of a stranger for such was Montoni and of a person who had but lately been anxious to hasten their nuptials It was in vain that she endeavoured to subdue her grief and resign herself to an event which she could not avoid The silence of Valancourt afflicted more than it surprised her since she attributed it to its just occasion but when the day preceding that on which she was to quit Tholouse arrived and she heard no mention of his being permitted to take leave of her grief overcame every consideration that had made her reluctant to speak of him and she enquired of Madame Montoni whether this consolation had been refused Her aunt  informed her that it had adding that after the provocation she had herself received from Valancourt in their last interview and the persecution which the Signor had suffered from his letters no entreaties should avail to procure it  "If the Chevalier expected this favour from us" said she "he should have conducted himself in a very different manner he should have waited patiently till he knew whether we were disposed to grant it and not have come and reproved me because I did not think proper to bestow my niece upon himand then have persisted in troubling the Signor because he did not think proper to enter into any dispute about so childish an affair His behaviour throughout has been extremely presumptuous and impertinent and I desire that I may never hear his name repeated and that you will get the better of those foolish sorrows and whims and look like other people and not appear with that dismal countenance as if you were ready to cry For  though you say nothing you cannot conceal your grief from my penetration I can see you are ready to cry at this moment though I am reproving you for it aye even now in spite of my commands"  Emily having turned away to hide her tears quitted the room to indulge them and the day was passed in an intensity of anguish such as she had perhaps never known before When she withdrew to her chamber for the night she remained in the chair where she had placed herself on entering the room absorbed in her grief till long after every member of the family except herself was retired to rest She could not divest herself of a belief that she had parted with Valancourt to meet no more a belief which did not arise merely from foreseen circumstances for though the length of the journey she was about to commence the uncertainty as to the period of her return together with the prohibitions she had received seemed to justify it she yielded also to an impression which she mistook  for a presentiment that she was going from Valancourt for ever How dreadful to her imagination too was the distance that would separate themthe Alps those tremendous barriers would rise and whole countries extend between the regions where each must exist To live in adjoining provinces to live even in the same country though without seeing him was comparative happiness to the conviction of this dreadful length of distance  Her mind was at length so much agitated by the consideration of her state and the belief that she had seen Valancourt for the last time that she suddenly became very faint and looking round the chamber for something that might revive her she observed the casements and had just strength to throw one open near which she seated herself The air recalled her spirits and the still moonlight that fell upon the elms of a long avenue fronting the window somewhat soothed them and determined her to try whether exercise and the open air  would not relieve the intense pain that bound her temples In the chateau all was still and passing down the great staircase into the hall from whence a passage led immediately to the garden she sostly and unheard as she thought unlocked the door and entered the avenue Emily passed on with steps now hurried and now faltering as deceived by the shadows among the trees she fancied she saw some person move in the distant perspective and feared that it was a spy of Madame Montoni Her desire however to revisit the pavilion where she had passed so many happy hours with Valancourt and had admired with him the extensive prospect over Languedoc and her native Gascony overcame her apprehension of being observed and she moved on towards the terrace which running along the upper garden commanded the whole of the lower one and communicated with it by a flight of marble steps that terminated the avenue  Having reached these steps she paused a  moment to look round for her distance from the chateau now increased the fear which the stillness and obscurity of the hour had awakened But perceiving nothing that could justify it she ascended to the terrace where the moonlight shewed the long broad walk with the pavilion at its extremity while the rays silvered the foliage of the high trees and shrubs that bordered it on the right and the tufted summits of those that rose to a level with the balustrade on the left from the garden below Her distance from the chateau again alarming her she paused to listen the night was so calm that no sound could have escaped her but she heard only the plaintive sweetness of the nightingale with the light shiver of the leaves and she pursued her way towards the pavilion having reached which its obscurity did not prevent the emotion that a fuller view of its wellknown scene would have excited The lattices were thrown back and shewed beyond their embowered arch the moonlight  landscape shadowy and soft its groves and plains extending gradually and indistinctly to the eye its distant mountains catching a stronger gleam and the nearer river reflecting the moon and trembling to her rays  Emily as she approached the lattice was sensible of the features of this scene only as they served to bring Valancourt more immediately to her fancy "Ah" said she with a heavy sigh as she threw herself into a chair by the window "how often have we sat together in this spotoften have looked upon that landscape Never never more shall we view it togethernevernever more perhaps shall we look upon each other"  Her tears were suddenly stopped by terrora voice spoke near her in the pavilion she shriekedit spoke again and she distinguished the well known tones of Valancourt It was indeed Valancourt who supported her in his arms For some moments their emotion would not suffer either to  speak "Emily" said Valancourt at length as he pressed her hand in his "Emily" and he was again silent but the accent in which he had pronounced her name expressed all his tenderness and sorrow  "O my Emily" he resumed after a long pause "I do then see you once again and hear again the sound of that voice I have haunted this placethese gardens for manymany nights with a faint very faint hope of seeing you This was the only chance that remained for me and thank heaven it has at length succeededI am not condemned to absolute despair"  Emily said something she scarcely knew what expressive of her unalterable affection and endeavoured tocalm the agitation of his mind but Valancourt could for some time only utter incoherent expressions of his emotions and when he was somewhat more composed he said "I came hither soon after sunset and have been watching in the gardens and in this pavilion  ever since for though I had now given up all hope of seeing you I could not resolve to tear myself from a place so near to you and should probably have lingered about the chateau till morning dawned O how heavily the moments have passed yet with what various emotion have they been marked as I sometimes thought I heard footsteps and fancied you were approaching and then againperceived only a dead and dreary silence But when you opened the door of the pavilion and the darkness prevented my distinguishing with certainty whether it was ray lovemy heart beat so strongly with hopes and fears that I could not speak The instant I heard the plaintive accents of your voice my doubts vanished but not my fears till you spoke of me then losing the apprehension of alarming you in the exces of my emotion I could no longer be silent O Emily these are moments in which joy and grief struggle so powerfully for  preeminence that the heart can scarcely support the contest"  Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of this assertion but the joy she felt on thus meeting Valancourt at the very moment when she was lamenting that they must probably meet no more soon melted into grief as reflection stole over her thoughts and imagination prompted visions of the future She struggled to recover the calm dignity of mind which was necessary to support her through this last interview and which Valancourt found it utterly impossible to attain for the transports of his joy changed abruptly into those of suffering and he expressed in the most impassioned language his horror of this separation and his despair of their ever meeting again Emily wept silently as she listened to him and then trying to command her own distress and to sooth his she suggested every circumstance that could lead to hope But the energy of his fears led him instantly to detect the friendly fallacies which she endeavoured  to impose on herself and him and also to conjure up illusions too powerful for his reason  "You are going from me" said he "to a distant country O how distantto new society new friends new admirers with people too who will try to make you forget me and to promote new connections How can I know this and not know that you will never return for menever can be mine" His voice was stifled by sighs  "You believe then" said Emily "that the pangs I suffer proceed from a trivial and temporary interest you believe"  "Suffer" interrupted Valancourt "suffer for me O Emilyhow sweethow bitter are those words what comfort what anguish do they give I ought not to doubt the steadiness of your affection yet such is the inconsistency of real love that it is always awake to suspicion however unreasonable always requiring new assurances from the object of its interest and thus it is that I always feel revived as by a new conviction when  your words tell me I am dear to you and wanting these I relapse into doubt and too often into despondency "Then seeming to recollect himself he exclaimed "But what a wretch am I thus to torture you and in these moments too I who ought to support and comfort you"  This reflection overcame Valancourt with tenderness but relapsing into despondency he again felt only for himself and lamented again this cruel separation in a voice and words so impassioned that Emily could no longer struggle to repress her own grief or to sooth his Valancourt between these emotions of love and pity lost the power and almost the wish of repressing his agitation and in the intervals of convulsive sobs he at one moment kissed away her tears then told her cruelly that possibly she might never again weep for him and then tried to speak more calmly but only exclaimed "O Emilymy heart will breakI cannotcannot leave you NowI gaze upon that countenance now I hold  you in my arms a little while and all this will appear a dream I shall look and cannot see you shall try to recollect your featuresand the impression will be fled from my imaginationto hear the tones of your voice and even memory will be silentI cannot cannot leave you Why should we confide the happiness of our whole lives to the will of people who have no right to interrupt and except in giving you to me have no power to promote it O Emily venture to trust your own heart venture to be mine forever" His voice trembled and he was silent Emily continued to weep and was silent also when Valancourt proceeded to propose an immediate marriage and that at an early hour on the following morning she should quit Madame Montoni's house and be conducted by him to the church of the Augustines where a friar should await to unite them  The silence with which she listened to a proposal dictated by love and despair and  enforced at a moment when it seemed scarcely possible for her to oppose itwhen her heart was softened by the sorrows of a separation that might be eternal and her reason obscured by the illusions of love and terror encouraged him to hope that it would not be rejected "Speak my Emily" said Valancourt eagerly "let me hear your voice let me hear you confirm my fate" She spoke not her cheek was cold and her senses seemed to fail her but she did not faint To Valancourt's terrified imagination she appeared to be dying he called upon her name rose to go to the chateau for assistance and then recollecting her situation feared to go or to leave her for a moment  After a few minutes she drew a deep sigh and began to revive The conflict she had suffered between love and the duty she at present owed to her father's sister her repugnance to a clandestine marriage her fear of emerging on the world with embarrassments such as might ultimately involve  the object of her affection in misery and repentanceall this various interest was too powerful for a mind already enervated by sorrow and her reason had suffered a transient suspension But duty and good sense however hard the conflict at length triumphed over affection and mournful presentiment above all she dreaded to involve Valancourt in obscurity and vain regret which she saw or thought she saw must be the too certain consequence of a marriage in their present circumstances and she acted perhaps with somewhat more than female fortitude when she resolved to endure a present rather than provoke a distant misfortune  With a candour that proved how truly she esteemed and loved him and which endeared her to him if possible more than ever she told Valancourt all her reasons for rejecting his proposals Those which influenced her concerning his future welfare he instantly resuted or rather contradicted but they awakened tender considerations for her which the frenzy of passion and  despair had concealed before and love which had but lately prompted him to propose a clandestine and immediate marriage now induced him to renounce it The triumph was almost too much for his heart for Emily's sake he endeavoured to stifle his grief but the swelling anguish would not be restrained "O Emily" said he "I must leave youI  must  leave you and I know it is for ever"  Convulsive sobs again interrupted his words and they wept together in silence till Emily recollecting the danger of being discovered and the impropriety of prolonging an interview which might subject her to censure summoned all her fortitude to utter a last farewell  "Stay" said Valancourt "I conjure you stay for I have much to tell you The agitation of my mind has hitherto suffered me to speak only on the subject that occupied itI have forborne to mention a doubt of much importance partly lest it should appear as if I told it with an ungenerous  view of alarming you into a compliance with my late proposal"  Emily much agitated did not leave Valancourt but she led him from the pavilion and as they walked upon the terrace he proceeded as follows  "This Montoni I have heard some strange hints concerning him Are you certain he is of Madame Quesnel's family and that his fortune is what it appears to be"  "I have no reason to doubt either" replied Emily in a voice of alarm "Of the first indeed I cannot doubt but I have no certain means of judging of the latter and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard"  "That I certainly will but it is very imperfect and unsatisfacotory information I gathered it by accident from an Italian who was speaking to another person of this Montoni They were talking of his marriage the Italian said that if he was the person he meant he was not likely to make  Madame Cheron happy He proceeded to speak of him in general terms of dislike and then gave some particular hints concerning his character that excited my curiosity and I ventured to ask him a few questions He was reserved in his replies but after hesitating for some time he owned that he had understood abroad that Montoni was a man of desperate fortune and character He said something of a castle of Montoni's situated among the Apennines and of some strange circumstances that might be mentioned as to his former mode of life I pressed him to inform me further but I believe the strong interest I felt was visible in my manner and alarmed him for no entreaties could prevail with him to give any explanation of the circumstances he had alluded to or to mention any thing further concerning Montoni I observed to him that if Montoni was possessed of a castle in the Apennines it appeared from such a circumstance that he was of some family and also seemed to  contradict the report that he was a man of entirely broken fortunes He shook his head and looked as if he could have said a great deal but made no reply  "A hope of learning something more satisfactory or more positive detained me in his company a considerable time and I renewed the subject repeatedly but the Italian wrapped himself up in reserve saidthat what he had mentioned he had caught only from a floating report and that reports frequently arose from personal malice and were very little to be depended upon I forbore to press the subject farther since it was obvious that he was alarmed for the consequence of what he had already said and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty on a point where suspense is almost intolerable Think Emily what I must suffer to see you depart for a foreign country committed to the power of a man of such doubtful character as is this Montoni But I will not alarm you unnecessarilyit is possible as the Italian said at first that  this is not the Montoni he alluded to Yet Emily consider well before you resolve to commit yourself to him O I must not trust myself to speakor I shall renounce all the motives which so lately influenced me to resign the hope of your becoming mine immediately"  Valancourt walked upon the terrace with hurried steps while Emily remained leaning on the balustrade in deep thought The information she had just received excited perhaps more alarm than it could justify and raised once more the conflict of contrasted interests She had never liked Montoni The fire and keenness of his eye its proud exultation its bold fierceness its sullen watchfulness as occasion and even slight occasion had called forth the latent soul she had often observed with emotion while from the usual expression of his countenance she had always shrunk From such observations she was the more inclined to believe that it was this Montoni of whom the Italian had uttered his suspicious  hints The thought of being solely in his power in a foreign land was terrifying to her but it was not by terror alone that she was urged to an immediate marriage with Valancourt The tenderest love had already pleaded his cause but had been unable to overcome her opinion as to her duty her disinterested considerations for Valancourt and the delicacy which made her revolt from a clandestine union It was not to be expected that a vague terror would be more powerful than the united influence of love and grief But it recalled all their energy and rendered a second conquest necessary  With Valancourt whose imagination was now awake to the suggestion of every passion whose apprehensions for Emily had acquired strength by the mere mention of them and became every instant more powerful as his mind brooded over themwith Valancourt no second conquest was attainable He thought he saw in the clearest light and love assisted the fear that this journey to Italy would involve Emily in misery he determinded  therefore to persevere in opposing it and in conjuring her to bestow upon him the title of her lawful protector  "Emily" said he with solemn earnestness "this is no time for serupulous distinctions for weighing the dubious and comparatively trifling circumstances that may affect our future comfort I now see much more clearly than before the train of serious dangers you are going to encounter with a man of Montoni's character Those dark hints of the Italian spoke much but not more than the idea I have of Montoni's disposition as exhibited even in his countenance I think I see at this moment all that could have been hinted written there He is the Italian whom I fear and I conjure you for your own sake as well as for mine to prevent the evils I shudder to foresee O Emily let my tenderness my arms withhold you from themgive me the right to defend you"  Emily only sighed while Valancourt proceeded to remonstrate and to entreat with  all the energy that love and apprehension could inspire But as his imagination magnified to her the possible evils she was going to meet the mists of her own fancy began to dissipate and allowed her to distinguish the exaggerated images which imposed on his reason She considered that there was no proof of Montoni being the person whom the stranger had meant that even if he was so the Italian had noticed his character and broken fortunes merely from report and that though the countenance of Montoni seemed to give probability to a part of the rumour it was not by such circumstances that an implicit belief of it could be justified These considerations would probably not have arisen so distinctly to her mind at this time had not the terrors of Valancourt presented to her such obvious exaggerations of her danger as incited her to distrust the fallacies of passion But while she endeavoured in the gentlest manner to convince him of his error she plunged him into a new one  His voice and countenance changed to an expression of dark despair "Emily" said he "this this moment is the bitterest that is yet come to me You do notcannot love meIt would be impossible for you to reason thus coolly thus deliberately if you did I  I  am torn with anguish at the prospect of our separation and of the evils that may await you in consequence of it I would encounter any hazards to prevent itto save you No Emily noyou cannot love me"  "We have now little time to waste in exclamation or assertion" said Emily endeavouring to conceal her emotion "if you are yet to learn how dear you are and ever must be to my heart no assurances of mine can give you conviction"  The last words faltered on her lips and her tears flowed fast Those words and tears brought once more and with instantaneous force conviction of her love to Valancourt He could only exclaim "Emily Emily" and weep over the hand he  pressed to his lips but she after some moments again roused herself from the indulgence of sorrow and said "I must leave you it is late and my absence from the chateau may be discovered Think of melove mewhen I am far away the belief of this will be my comfort"  "Think of youlove you" exclaimed Valancourt  "Try to moderate these transports" said Emily "for my sake try"  "For your sake"  "Yes for my sake" replied Emily in a tremulous voice "I cannot leave you thus"  "Then do not leave me" said Valancourt with quickness "Why should we part or part for longer than till tomorrow"  "I am indeed I am unequal to these moments" replied Emily "you tear my heart but I never can consent to this hasty imprudent proposal"  "If we could command our time my  Emily it should not be thus hasty we must submit to circumstances"  "We must indeed I have already told you all my heartmy spirits are gone You allowed the force of my objections till your tenderness called up vague terrors which have given us both unnecessary anguish Spare me do not oblige me to repeat the reasons I have already urged"  "Spare you" cried Valancourt "I am a wretcha very wretch that have felt only for myselfI who ought to have shewn the fortitude of man who ought to have supported you l have increased your sufferings by the conduct of a child Forgive me Emily think of the distraction of my mind now that I am about to part with all that is dear to meand forgive me When you are gone I shall recollect with bitter remorse what I have made you suffer and shall wish in vain that I could see you if only for a moment that I might sooth your grief"  Tears again interrupted his voice and Emily wept with him "I will shew my  self more worthy of your love" said Valancourt at length "I will not prolong these moments My Emilymy own Emily never forget me God knows when we shall meet again I resign you to his care O GodO Godprotect and bless her"  He pressed her hand to his heart Emily sunk almost lifeless on his bosom and neither wept nor spoke Valancourt now commanding his own distress tried to comfort and reassure her but she appeared totally unaffected by what he said and a sigh which she uttered now and then was all that proved she had not fainted  He supported her slowly towards the chateau weeping and speaking to her but she answered only in sighs till having reached the gate that terminated the avenue she seemed to have recovered her consciousness and looking round perceived how near they were to the chateau "We must part here" said she stopping "Why prolong these moments Teach me the fortitude I have forgot"  Valancourt struggled to assume a composed air "Farewell my love" said he in a voice of solemn tenderness"trust me we shall meet againmeet for each othermeet to part no more" His voice faltered but recovering it he proceeded in a firmer tone "You know not what I shall suffer till I hear from you I shall omit no opportunity of conveying to you my letters yet I tremble to think how few may occur And trust me love for your dear sake I will try to bear this absence with fortitude O how little I have shewn tonight"  "Farewell" said Emily faintly
