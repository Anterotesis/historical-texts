BRITAIN FRANCE AND IRELAND KING DEFENDER OF THE FAITH c THIS PEERAGE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND EMBELLISHED WITH PRINTS REPRESENTING THE ILLUSTRIOUS ACTIONS OF THE NOBILITY IS WITH ALL SUBMISSION MOST HUMBLY DEDICATED BY HIS OBEDIENT AND FAITHFUL SUBJECT  ROBERT POLLARD  ADDRESS  AT a time when the Arts find universal patronage and the enterprise of taste and spirit is drawn forth into works at once gratifying to the amateur and honourable to the nation producing them it is not easy for an active individual in the habits of professional research to content himself with merely admiringhe feels a wish to emulate and naturally adopts those means which best accord with his inclination or ability The Proprietor of the present undertaking seeks to contribute his effort towards the further advancement of the  Graphic Art  and on that ground respectfully solicits the attention of the Public to a field of emulation which hitherto has remained unexplored he aims to commemorate the actions of the re∣nowned Ancestors of our Nobility and to trace them through those dignified scenes of glorious achievement which at once gained for themselves and successors the particular distinction of their Sovereign and secured to their country the dearest rights and privileges it enjoys to those great characters are their countrymen indebted for the blessings of a valuable con∣stitution and to their memories should be directed the highest tribute of reverence and admiration  The Publisher of this Work is fully persuaded that in point of general importance  historical subjects  founded on na∣tional fact claim preeminence over all others and he likewise knows that the most interesting events of a kingdom are chiefly to be looked for in the annals of its Nobility he flatters him∣self therefore that his design at least will be approved and is only anxious to acquit himself with satisfaction in the arduous task of collecting arranging and executing In the choice of subjects for Engraving every attention will be paid to those most important interesting and honourable the services of the Soldier the Seaman the Ambassador the Churchman and the Senator will form the source of Historic Compositionthe Statesman and the Lawgiver that of Portraitureand correct Views and Delineations of the venerable Castle or Monument which has been the scene or record of a remarkable event will with other apposite embellishments further illustrate the Biographic Narration  To the literary part of the Work equal attention will be paidnothing short of authenticity will be adopted whe∣ther in the necessary supply of compiled materials or in the original communications which the Publisher is already possessed of and hopes to be honoured with from the No∣bility or the curious in research and the whole is intended  to be thrown into a form as elegant copious and comprehen∣sive as possible In the arrangement of the Peerage an al∣phabetical mode will be adopted but with due observance of precedency in the different orders of Nobilitythus will the Work in its progress take up a pleasing variety of ancient and modern subjects for the Historical Painter and when com∣pleted possess all the convenience of a Biographical Dictionary  In every department of execution the Publisher's first aim is  excellence  from a conviction that it would be absurd to ex∣pect public patronage without it his Subscribers may rest assured no Artist will be employed who is not fully equal to the task and if a judgment corrected by several years study and experience in the Art of Engraving can further induce a repose of confidence he presumes the Encouragers of the Work will not be disappointed every thing tending to illus∣trate embellish or beautify the subject will be strictly and uniformly attended to and in short no exertion will be spared to form through the medium of the Arts a complete elegant and interesting PEERAGE of ENGLAND SCOTLAND and IRELAND  {inverted ⁂} The Subjects intended for the Second Volume are now in the hands of the respective Artists  PREFACE  To please the amateurs of the Polite Arts to gratify the lovers of Biographic History to exhibit to the world the prowess of renowned ancestry and lastly to honour the brilliant achievements of our Nobility is certainly a pursuit at once interesting pleasing and laudable  It is near three years since this work was first offered to public attention much of that time has been diligently appropriated to facilitate the undertaking and every possible exertion made to fulfil the engagementthat with confidence the Proprietor might look up to its Patrons for approbation and encouragement Two years how∣ever had scarcely elapsed before it became necessary to remove some injurious pre∣possessions entertained of its being a work of adventure and that it was not his inten∣tion to proceed with the execution of it To confute this insinuation he was fortunately and happily prepared and to answer it with effect lost no time in silencing that rumour by immediately transmitting to the booksellers in London and to those of the principal cities and towns in England Scotland and Ireland Specimens of ten Historical Engravings and as many elegant Designs then executed as em∣bellishments to the work together with other ocular and demonstrative proofs of the sincerity of his intentions Had he been desirous of making the performance less correct and methodical it would have appeared earlier for much time has been spent in his personal attendance on those noble Peers whose titles and history com∣pose this First Number flattering himself that in a work where the honour of their families is so materially concerned they would readily have acquiesced in afford∣ing their aid Some were found of this description who with an amiable conde∣scension  and goodness frankly tendered their assistance whilst others resisted his most ardent solicitations with coolness and indifference  The connoisseur of real taste the admirer of Historic Composition where the su∣blime genius of the Graphic Art revels in her glory by exhibiting the thought the action and the very soul of man will find in the progress of this work a fund of information and entertainment not eclipsed by any productions from the annals of the Grecian or Roman empiresA treat also will be furnished for the amateurs of Heraldry that typographic history of family alliances the Proprietor reposing with confidence on their applause and courting only a fair comparison with others to ensure their ap∣probation To the lovers of Biography he humbly presents a compilation from the most authentic of all the English peeragists the late Mr Collins for the Scottish genealogy he has selected from their most approved author Mr Douglas and in procuring materials for the Irish Peerage he has followed Mr Lodge the informa∣tion of these gentlemen is brought down to the present time with improvements and amendments revised by an officer in the College of Arms  The new plan here adopted of prefacing the history of the present Peers by a brief account of the ancient families who were honoured with those titles but now extinct is attended with utility and information inasmuch as it aids the genealogists and elucidates the annals of these kingdoms for in the process of time it frequently occurred that the same titles were bestowed on different personages by different so∣vereigns and without a considerable attention to chronology the reader is liable to confound one Peer with another  Perhaps it may be expected some apology should be made for deviating from the usual mode of publishing Peerages under the names of the respective kingdoms separate from each otherOn a reference to those publications it will be found that such of the Nobility who possess Peerages in two or in each of the three kingdoms are subject to much needless repetition and no otherwise varied than in  the titlesBy avoiding the old plan therefore and arranging them in the manner of a Biographical Dictionary the reference to any respective Peer is accomplished with greater ease and facility and the order of precedency still faithfully preserved according to law and the article in the Act of Union as established in the reign of Queen Anne  Many inaccuracies no doubt will insensibly creep into a work of this kind from the unavoidable multiplicity of figures and dates for such he solicits the correction and indulgence of the candid reader but to obviate those alterations which come under the description of the increase or decrease of families and titles it is the Proprietor's intention to give at the conclusion of the work an Addenda stating such variations as will naturally occur during its progress  To expatiate on the advantages of biography to point out the utility and security of genealogy to exhibit to the world the national benefits accruing from that stimu∣lus to great and noble actions  honorary distinction  to paint the ineffable esteem of a grateful people for the services of their worthy Patriots to hold up for general imi∣tation the examples of great and good men who have filled the various offices of church or state in the maintenance of order for the security of public right the pro∣tection of property and the liberties of their country would in this place be an∣ticipating what the work is designed to effect  To avoid the imputation of prolixity and to encourage the pertinence of brevity is an object worthy the strict attention of the Editor and no doubt requires a refined taste and a matured judgment without incurring the accusation of presumption he trusts he may premise that it is the first wish of his heart to execute it with accuracy and to pursue his plan with firmness reposing on the known taste and liberality of his country in patronizing undertakings dedicated not only to amuse∣ment instruction and utility but to aid a nobler purpose that of holding up the strongest incitement to emulation the example of others in the paths of every public and private virtue  REFERENCE TO THE HISTORICAL AND ORNAMENTAL PRINTS AS ALSO TO THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS DESIGNED TO

noble House of Campbel is acknowledged in Scotland by all their historians and derived from a series of illustrious ancestors who possessed Lochow in Argyleshire according to the traditional accounts of the bards and sa∣nachies as early as the time of King Fergus II who restored the monarchy of Scot∣land A D The first appellation they used was O'Dwbin assumed from Diarmed O'Dwbin one of their ancestors a brave and warlike man and in the Irish language his descendants are called to this time Scol Diarmed From this Diarmed O'Dwbin the bards have recorded a long series of the Barons of Lochow whose actions they tell us were renowned both for conduct and valour  Paul O'Dwbin Lord of Lochow called Paul in Spuran so denominated from his being the King's Treasurer having no male issue his estate went to his daughter Eva who married Gillespick O'Dwbin a relation of her own who changed the name first from O'Dwbin to Campbel to preserve and perpetuate the memory of a noble and heroic atchievement performed by him to the crown of France in the reign of Malcolm Canmore From this Gillespick is deduced the descent of the illustrious family of Argyle  GILLESPICK O'DWBIN or CAMPBEL Lord of Lochow according to the MS history of the family lived in the reign of King David I and married Eva only daughter and heiress of Paul O'Dwbin before noticed by whom he had a son  DUNCAN CAMPBEL of Lochow who succeeded him and flourished in the reign of King Malcolm IV and left a son and successor  COLIN CAMPBEL of Lochow who lived in the reign of King William sumamed the Lion he left a son  GILLESPICK or ARCHIBALD CAMPBEL of Lochow who succeeded him and flourished in the reign of King William and beginning of King Alex∣ander II and is particularly mentioned in the statutes of that Prince in the year c He married Finetta daughter of John Frazer Lord of Tweddale by whom he had a son and successor  DUNCAN CAMPBEL of Lochow who in the reign of Alexander II married a daughter of the family of Cummyn by whom he had issue two sons Sir Gillespick and John a very famous author who flourished betwixt and and was an ornament to his country for learning c Duncan was succeeded by his eldest son  SIR GILLESPICK or ARCHIBALD CAMPBEL Knight of Lochow who made a considerable figure towards the end of the reign of Alexander II and beginning of Alexander III In the charter of erection of the burgh of Newburgh this Gillespick Campbel together with William Earl of Mar John de Lindsay John de Hay William Bisset c are witnesses at Strivling th of March He married a daughter of William de Somerville Baron of Carnwarth by whom he had issue one son  SIR COLIN MOOR CAMPBEL Dominus de Lochow who succeeded him a renowned and warlike chieftain He had the honour of Knighthood con∣ferred on him by King Alexander III anno and from him the chief or head of the family of Argyle is called MacallenMore in the Highlands to this day He was one of the great men who were summoned to Berwick on the part of Robert de Bruce in the competition with John de Baliol for the crown of Scotland on the demise of Queen Margaret This Sir Colin acquired from Sir William Lindsay the lands of Symington in Airshire and made a donation of the superiority thereof to the monks of Newbottle by a charter wherein he is called Dominus Colinus Campbel Miles fdius quondam Domini Gillespick Campbel c anno In a conflict with a great neighbour of his the Lord of Lorn he was slain at a place called the String of Cowel His death occasioned much bloodshed and kindled  such a flame of animosity betwixt the two families of Lochow arid Lorn as was not extinguished for many years after even so long as the Argadii Lords of Lorn existed  This Colin by his wife a lady of the family of the Sinclairs had three sons Sir Neil his successor Sir Donald Campbel of Redhouse or Reidcastle of whom the family of Loudon and other cadets of this illustrious branch of the Campbels derive themselves and also John Campbel who was educated to the church  SIR NEIL CAMPBEL his eldest son was honoured with Knighthood by King Alexander III at the end of his reign but none of his achievements are par∣ticularized till the year that on the demise of Queen Margaret he was one of those eminent men summoned to Berwick on the part of Robert de Bruce when he and all the other competitors for the crown of Scotland had referred the decision of their respective claims to Edward I of England and when that Prince declared in favour of John de Baliol Sir Neil Campbel did so far acquiesce in the decision as to remain faithful to King John till that unhappy Prince unkinged himself by an inglorious surrender of the independency of the crown to the King of England whom he acknowledged superior and direct Lord of Scotland  But no sooner did Robert de Bruce reassert his title to the crown and formed a rational project of recovering his own right and of freeing his country from its sub∣jection than Sir Neil Campbel was among the first of the numerous patriots that resorted to him owned his title and gave so many proofs of his zeal and merit for the liberty and honour of his country and of his loyalty to that heroic Prince that he was thought most worthy and appointed to command a party of loyalists sent to Argyleshire to curb and overawe the Lord of Lorn who was a declared enemy to the liberty of his country and of consequence to the Brucian title He performed that service committed to him with honour and success insomuch that in a short time he recovered the countries of Argyle and Lorn and brought them to submit to King Robert though opposed by the joint efforts of the Lord Lorn and his nume∣rous accomplices  Sir Neil stood firm to King Robert and was among those Scots patriots that accompanied him to Scoon and assisted at the solemnity of his coronation anno after which he gave many signal instances of his stedfastness and loyalty to that Monarch even in the worst circumstances for when he was far from being  CAMPBEL Duke of ARGYLE  ROBERT King of Scots presenting to Sir Neil Campbel his SISTER in marriage  NE OBLIVIS CA  IS  VIX EA NOSTRA VOCO  blazon or coat of arms  firmly established on the throne he entered into a memorable association with Sir Gilbert Hay Sir Alexander Seton and other loyalists who met at the monastery of Cambuskenneth and there laying their hands on the altar and touching the conse∣crated sacrament solemnly swore "That till the last period of their lives they would defend the liberties of their country and the right of Robert Bruce their King against all mortalsFrench English and Scots" to which they appended their names and seals the th day of September  After the King became well settled on his throne Sir Neil as an able statesman was chosen one of the Plenipotentiaries for a treaty of peace with England particu∣larly he with Sir John Menteith on the part of Scotland and Richard de Burgh Earl of Ulster c for England in  Soon after the battle of Bannockburn in he was one of the Commissioners on the part of Scotland authorized to treat with the English for a lasting peace but Edward refusing to recognize their master's title and independence the treaty at that time took not its desired effect The next year ensuing he was one of the Barons at the Parliament held at Aire where they made an entail of the crown to King Robert and his heirs About which time in consideration of his good ser∣vices and signal loyalty he obtained a grant of several lands then in the crown by the forfeiture of those who adhered to the interest of Baliol and to honour him the more the King bestowed on him the Lady Mary Bruce his sister in mar∣riage by whom he had two sonsColin his successor and John Campbel who was by King David Brace dignified with the title of Earl of Athol then in the crown by the forfeiture of David de Strabogie but dying without issue the honours returned to the crown and were afterwards bestowed upon William Douglas Lord of Liddisdale Sir Neil dying in the end of the year or the beginning of was succeeded by his eldest son  SIR COLIN CAMPBEL of Lochow who was also a great loyalist and began early in life to distinguish himself for military atchievements He was in the expedition made into Ireland in in behalf of Edward Bruce then King of that realm where his behaviour for courage and conduct was so remarkable that King Robert upon his return rewarded him with a grant of divers lands in Argyle∣shire by a charter yet extant and having faithfully demeaned himself during the whole course of King Robert's reign he continued no less stedfast to King David  his son for whose service even when his affairs were looked on to be lost he raised four hundred men and took the castle of Dunoon then in the hands of the English for which and other eminent services that Prince when he came to be established on the throne made him Hered  ary Governor thereof which his descendants still enjoy to this time He married a daughter of the family of Lenox by whom he had three sons and one daughter viz Sir Archibald his successor John Campbel ancestor of the branch of Barbreck of whom descended Campbel of Succouch Sir Dougal Campbel who lost his estate for adhering to Edward Baliol Alicia his daughter was married to Alan Lauder of Hatton He had a natural son Neil of whom the Campbels of Melfort derive their descent

Majesty was graciously pleased to create him Marquis of Argyle by letter patent bearing date November  During the troubles in King Charles's reign he joined the Parliament of Scot∣land and was a zealous assertor of the Presbyterianchurch government but after the death of the King he contributed much to the reception and coronation of King Charles II and on the first of January had the honour to put the crown on the King's head at Scoon but having afterwards joined and sided with Oliver Cromwell was soon after the Restoration found guilty by the Parliament of hightreason and beheaded at Edinburgh on the th of May and his estates and honours forfeited to the crown Previous to his execution he solemnly declared "That from his birth to that moment he was free of any accession to the

all the commissions were then given by the Parliament yet he would not serve without a commission from the King After the defeat of the royal army at Worcester in he took arms for his Majesty's service which incensed Oliver Cromwell so much against him that though he granted a pardon and general indemnity to the people in Scotland by his proclamation April yet was he with several other loyalists parti∣cularly excepted and was made prisoner and with singular constancy preserv∣ing his duty and fidelity to his Majesty inviolate would never submit or come to  any composition with Oliver Cromwell till he had General Middleton's order from the King to do so bearing date December he then without any other engagement than laying down his arms retired to his own house and lived pri∣vately and quietly till King Charles was happily restored in It was in con∣sideration of this his eminent loyalty and zeal in his Majesty's service that his father's forfeiture was reversed and he reinstated to the estates and titles in not long after which he was named a Privycounsellor and one of the Commis∣sioners of the Treasury which for many years he discharged with great fidelity and through all changes earnestly espoused the Protestant interest and Presbyterianchurch government About the year the Test act passed whereby all ranks of people were enjoined by act of Parliament to defend the government in church and state c c under the pains of treason c The principle of the act might be good and expedient but carried a compulsatory air with it which gave umbrage to a great many wellmeaning men at the time particularly to this noble Earl who for strictness of honour and principle had so eminently distinguished himself and when the oath was tendered to him he refused to comply with it in those terms but offered to take it with his own explanation part whereof were in these words "I take it in so far as it is consistent in itself and the Protestant religion and I do declare I mean not to bind up myself in my station but in a lawful way to endeavour any thing I think for the advantage of the church or state not repugnant to the Protestant religion and my loyalty and this I understand as a part of my oath" For which and by the insinuating persuasions of some who bore him no good will the King was so far incensed against him that he was sent prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh and on his trial December was found guilty of hightreason his estate forfeited and himself sentenced to suffer death but he made his escape out of the Castle in the dress of a lady's page and got over to Holland where he remained about four years However in the beginning of King James VII's reign he got some officers and soldiers together in Holland with whom he invaded Scotland and landed in Argyleshire in He raised about two thousand men mostly of his own clan He then emitted a manifesto declaring  That he had not invaded his country for any private ends but in defence of his own just right and for the recovery of his estate which was unjustly forfeited in the reign of the late King And the Duke of York having invaded the religion and liberties of the kingdom  he thought it not only just but his duty to God and his country to oppose his tyrannical usurpation and invited all true Protestants to join him  The Earl's little army being defeated and dispersed and himself taken prisoner he was again sent to the castle of Edinburgh and soon after there beheaded at the marketcross in consequence of his former sentence on the th of June it being the opinion of the judges that as he was already dead in the law he could not be tried again for his last act of rebellion  He left issue by his marriage with Lady Mary Stewart daughter of James Earl of Murray four sons and two daughters  Archibald afterwards Duke of Argyle  John Campbel of Mammore who was ancestor of the fourth Duke  Colonel Charles Campbel  Colonel James Campbel who married Margaret daughter of David

Scotland in name of the Convention of Estates to the Prince and Princess of Orange who on the th of April were crowned King and Queen of Scotland and on the th of May following the Earl accom∣panied

Argyle died in and was succeeded by his eldest son  JOHN SECOND DUKE OF ARGYLE whose genius leading him to a mili∣tary life he went early into the British service and was Commander of a regiment of foot when not full seventeen years of age and gave great proof of his valour and bravery eminently distinguishing himself throughout the whole course of the cam∣paigns of Queen Ann's wars and in particular at the battle of Ramilies at the attack of the counterscarp of Menin of which he took possession He commanded at reducing the fort of Piepondale assisted at the siege of Ostend and was service∣able at the battle of Oudenard assisted again at the siege of Lisle of which city he took possession also at the siege of Ghent and Bruges in In the same year he particularly aggrandized himself at the siege of Tournay and at the terrible attack of the wood in the great battle of Malplaquet upon which desperate command he was ordered by the Duke of Marlborough where his person was much exposed but came off unhurt with great honour At intermissions from his military ser∣vice his Grace was not less active in affairs of state having contributed much towards the union of the two kingdoms and was very instrumental in bringing that great work to a conclusion and when on that occasion a riotous multitude came in great numbers to the Parliament Close demanding with loud voices "That the Treaty of Union be rejected" his Grace went out of the house and spoke with such calmness and strength of reason that they relinquished their claims and retired peaceably to their homes Her Majesty having restored the most ancient and noble Order of the Thistle his Grace was one of the first that was received into that Order on his return into England Soon after the union of the two kingdoms he was sworn one of the Privycouncil and to his other employments was added that of Lord High Commissioner to represent her royal person in Parliament though  his Grace was then but twentythree years of age Her Majesty was so well satis∣fied with his conduct and services that she created him a Peer by the title of Baron of Chatham and Earl of Greenwich in England On December his Grace was installed a Knight of the most noble order of the Garter by proxy and in January following was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to King Charles III also CaptainGeneral and Commander in Chief of all her Majesty's forces in Spain and Governor of the island of Minorca Our affairs in that kingdom were then at so low an ebb that his Grace's friends were concerned at his accepting those employments being sensible how difficult it would be for him to gain a footing but he acquiesced in the Queen's pleasure and some time after went on that service His want of forces on his arrival there would not permit him to undertake any considerable enterprize but in September he defeated a body of the Spanish horse and took several prisoners After which he was taken with so violent a fever as obliged him to quit the camp and retire to Barcelona where towards the latter end of November being pretty well recovered and the affairs of Europe taking a new turn by the death of the Emperor Joseph c he em∣barked for Leghorn and left Florence in February and arrived in England in March Soon after his return he was constituted General and Commander in Chief of all the landforces in North Britain His Grace on the demise of the Queen was appointed one of the Lords Justices to be added to the seven great officers of the kingdom for the government of the nation till his Majesty's arrival from Hanover On the accession of George I he was again constituted General and Commander in Chief of his Majesty's forces in Scotland and the Privycouncil being dissolved and a new one appointed to meet on October he was sworn thereof Also on October he was appointed Governor of Minorca and in June made Colonel of the royal regiment of horseguards in England and in the same year he was made Gentleman of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Stole to his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales In September a rebellion broke out in Scotland in favour of the Pretender headed by the Earl of Mar and others who had the address to assemble together not less than six or seven thousand Highlanders who marched from Perth about the th of November The Duke of Argyle marched out from Stirling about the same time to oppose them and by his interest and conduct prevented the rebels from gaining any place of strength They  came to an engagement at Sheriffmuir upon the th where the Duke of Argyle's courage and conduct was remarkable for though the rebels were far more numerous and many of the clans fought very gallantly yet they were forced to retreat to Perth and his Grace returned with his forces to Stirling After which being joined by six thousand of the Dutch troops under General Cadogan he forced the rebels to abandon Perth and the Pretender was obliged to retire to France with the utmost precipitation without being crowned as he had appointed and for safety his ad∣herents were forced to fly the kingdom Having settled affairs in the North of Scot∣land he returned to Edinburgh where he was joyfully received by the Magistrates and principal citizens who on the occasion honoured him with an elegant and sumptuous entertainment  His Grace came to court and waited on his Majesty on March th following and in June resigned all his places In the year he was made Lord Steward of the Household and on April following in consideration of his great services to the nation was advanced to the dignity of a Dukedom in England by the style and title of Duke of Greenwich On his resigning the place of Lord Steward of his Majesty's Household he was constituted MasterGeneral of the Ordnance and FieldMarshal of Great Britain and by George II was appointed Colonel of his Majesty's regiment of horse Governor and Captain of the town and isle of Ports∣mouth and of SouthSea Castle c c  His Grace held many other high posts from time to time and was equally con∣spicuous for his patriotism and his spirited eloquence in the House of Peers as for his bravery and conduct in the field He endeared himself to the citizens and inhabitants of Edinburgh for the noble defence he made of the privileges of the town when it was moved they should be taken away on account of the premature death of an officer of the name of Porteus With much truth he merited the celebrated character which Pope gives him  "  Argyle  the state's whole thunder born to wield  "And shake alike the senate and the field"  A magnificent monument is erected in WestminsterAbbey to the memory of this great Peer executed in the best style of that eminent statuary Roubiliac upon which is the following inscription  Britons behold if patriot worth be dear  A shrine that claims the tributary tear  Silent that tongue admiring senates heard  Nerveless that arm opposing legions fear'd  Nor less O Campbel thine the power to please  And give to grandeur all the grace of ease  Long from thy life let kindred heroes trace  Arts which ennoble still the noblest race  Others may owe their future fame to me  I borrow immortality from thee  John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich c In memory of an honest man a con∣stant friend John the Great Duke of Argyle and Greenwich a General and Orator exceeded by none in the age he lived  Sir Henry Fermer Baronet by his last will left the sum of five hundred pounds towards erecting this monument and recommended the above inscription  DESCRIPTION  The figures on the monument are principally larger than the life The first is Argyle in a sitting attitude above the sarcophagus leaning on the lap of Fame who is inscribing on the pyramid the above inscription Below seated on the right is an emblematic figure of Britannia looking up to the hero with admiration and esteem on the left attired and ornamented with her proper attributes is Eloquence

Duke of Buccleugh and secondly to Charles Townsend Esq second son of Lord Viscount Townsend  Lady Anne married to William Earl  of Strafford  Lady Jane died young  Lady Betty married to the Honourable James Stewart M'Kenzie son of James Earl of Bute  Lady Mary married to Edward late Viscount Coke  The Duke died in October in the sixtythird year of his age and having no sons the titles of Duke of Greenwich and Baron of Chatham ceased with him but in his other honours he was succeeded by his brother  ARCHIBALD THIRD DUKE OF ARGYLE who was born at Hamhouse in England in June and was educated at the university of Glasgow He afterwards applied himself to the study of the law at Utrecht but upon his father being created a Duke he laid that aside and betook himself to a military life served under the great Duke of Marlborough was Colonel of the thirtysixth regi∣ment of foot and Governor of Dumbartoncastle but his genius pointing more strongly to the statesman than the soldier he did not continue long in the army but applied himself chiefly to that study which made the latter part of his life so shining and conspicuous  In he was made Treasurer of Scotland and took his seat in the Parliament where he made so great a figure that in he was nominated one of the Com∣missioners for the treaty of Union during the continuance of which he was created Earl and Viscount Islay Lord Ormsay Dunoon Arrois c  In he was made an extraordinary Lord of Session and in was elected one of the sixteen Peers for the British Parliament and was chosen Member to every subsequent session excepting that called to meet in November In he was made JusticeGeneral of Scotland and in he was called to the Privycouncil  In upon the accession of King George I he was nominated LordRegister and though he had long before given up all command in the army yet upon the breaking out of the rebellion in he again betook himself to arms in defence of the House of Hanover and by his prudent conduct in the Highlands prevented General Gordon at the head of men from penetrating into the country and raising levies He afterwards joined his brother at Stirling and was wounded at the battle of Dumblane In he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal and was Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen and was entrusted with the direction of the affairs in Scotland to the time of his death  Upon the decease of his brother he became Duke of Argyle hereditary Justice  General Lieutenant Sheriff and Commissary of Argyleshire and the Western Isles Hereditary Great Master of the Household Hereditary Keeper of Dunstaff∣nage Carrick and several other castles  He was a man endowed with great natural powers and distinguished for his men∣tal accomplishments quick penetrating and thoroughly conversant in the know∣ledge of mankind of an accurate and distinct elocution and a ready judgment His great knowledge in the laws of his country qualified him to shine in the great council of the nation and in the cabinet of his Sovereign His sagacity and un∣common abilities pointed him out as a proper person for the chief management of all the Scotch affairs and the propriety of the choice will appear from his attention to the duties of his office in time of peace his study was to promote trade and manu∣factures to encourage learning the arts and sciences and to forward every improve∣ment that would tend to the good of his country  During his administration the manufacture of linen cloth was raised to an un∣common height both in quality and quantity The Universities received distin∣guishing marks of his favour by establishing new professions and in every shape promoting their benefit particularly he encouraged the profession of Physic in the University of Edinburgh which is now famous as a seminary for the study of that science all over Europe  He procured from his Majesty George II for the use of the infirmary of Edin∣burgh the invalid money amounting to about l a sum that enabled the Ma∣nagers of that hospital to enlarge their plan considerably the utility of which is daily felt by the numbers of poor patients both naval military and others who all find relief from this excellent charity  After the battle of Culloden he projected a plan in order to destroy the seeds of future rebellion he advised his Majesty to employ the Highlanders in the army a proposal worthy of the Patriot who contrived it magnanimous in the King who approved it and most honourable to themselves who executed it for it must be allowed that to this wise counsel it was principally owing that Cape Breton Ca∣nada c are now under the government of this kingdom as the courage and intre∣pidity of these brave men wherever they were called contributed greatly to the conquests of the British arms  Such was Archibald in a public sphere nor was he less distinguished in private  life His eminent learning and strong natural talents contributed to make him pass his hours of recess from business agreeable to himself and for the instruction and good of others He was qualified for every subject of conversation whether with the greatest philosopher or the most ingenious mechanic For the amuse∣ment of the closet he collected the most valuable private library in Great Britain where he unbent his mind from the cares of ministerial affairs and kept adding to the immense stock of knowledge he had already acquired The noble and magni∣ficent palace which he built at Inverara will stand a lasting monument of his regard to the accommodation and convenience of his family and transmit to posterity a just sense of the splendour and dignity of the house of Argyle  He enjoyed all the faculties of his mind sound and entire till his death which happened very suddenly on the th day of April in the seventyninth year of his age and was according to his own desire buried at Kilmun in the parish of Dunoon in Argyleshire the burial place of the family  He married a daughter of Mr Whitfield Paymaster of the Marines but by her who died in had no issue His estate and honours devolved upon his cousin and heirmale General John Campbel eldest son and heir of the Honourable John Campbel of Mammore who married Elizabeth daughter of John Lord Elphingston by whom he had seven sons and six daughters the first son and heir with whom we now proceed was  JOHN FOURTH DUKE OF ARGYLE of Mammore who went early into the army and in he commanded a detachment of the troops as a Colonel of the Queen's guards that first took possession of the main guard of Dunkirk at the treaty of peace in order to its

town which was denominated from the Bertiestad now Bersted near Maidstone in Kent Sted and Stad denoting in the Saxon language a town  It appears from an old manuscript in the Cotton library that LEOPALD DE BERTIE was Constable of Dovercastle in the reign of King Ethelred from whom descended HIERONYMUS DE BERTIE founder or at least a great benefactor to one of the monasteries in Kent the north part of which he built at his own expence and himself was buried in a chapel there where these arms were put up against a pillar viz  Three Battering Rams in Pale  The said Leopald quarrelling with the monks of St Austin at Canterbury about tythes and the monks endeavouring to carry them off by force of arms a fight began wherein a son of Leopald's was slain of which he complained to the King but receiving no satisfaction he flew for aid to Swain King of the Danes who invaded the kingdom with a powerful fleet which was divided into two squadrons one steering towards Northumberland and the other for Kent where they joined Leopald's forces and laid siege to Canterbury which they took in the year leading the Archbishop away captive But Swain dying the scale soon turned for Ethelred miserably persecuted the Danes and BURBACH BERTIE the only surviving son of Leopald conscious of his father's actions went to Robert King  of France who received him honourably and taking to wife a French woman settled there where his posterity continued till the year when Philip Bertie with his family accompanied Henry II into England and by that Prince's favour recovered his patrimony in Bersted  This PHILIP had issue MARTIN who was father of ROBERT who had issue WILLIAM who had issue EDWARD who father of JEROME BERTIE who lived at Bersted aforesaid in the reign of Henry V which com∣menced March and ended August  This JEROME one Sunday in Lent hearing a monk in a church exclaiming against the murder occasioned by his ancestor rushed in upon him and slew him for which rash act he was excommunicated by the Archbishop from which he could not be absolved at any rate so he went to Rome where he obtained absolution with this injunction viz "To hear in the monastery of Canterbury mass pub∣licly on a Sunday then to ask first of the Archbishop and then of the monks pardon then to be absolved and receive the sacrament and to give to the convent two pieces of gold as the fruit of his repentance and for the souls of his ancestors He afterwards became a benefactor by new building at his own charge their church by which as my author saith he much impaired his fortune on earth but by it he obtained a greater in heaven  To this Jerome succeeded ROBERT DE BERTIE his son and heir who had issue a son of his own name ROBERT father of WILLIAM BERTIE who by his wife a daughter of Pepper had issue THOMAS BERTIE of Bersted in Kent Esq who was Captain of Hurstcastle in the Isle of Wight the latter end of the reign of Henry VII and was living in that of Edw VI as appears in a grant of his arms and crest bearing date July Edw VI by Thomas Hawley Clarenceux King of Arms wherein he certifies "That he was descended of an house undefamed was then Captain of Hurstcastle for the King's Majesty and had of a long time used himself in feats of arms and good works so that he was worthy in all places of honour to be admitted numbered and taken in the company of other nobles c" By his wife a daughter of Say of the county of Salop he had issue Richard Bertie Esq  This RICHARD FIRST LORD had his education first in Corpus Christi col∣lege Oxon of which house he was Fellow and afterwards under Thomas Wriothesley  Earl of Southampton Lord High Chancellor of England and being singularly accomplished and learned in the French Italian and Latin tongues he gained the affections of Catherine the fourth wife of Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk who left her a widow August Hen VIII She was in her own right Baroness Willoughby of Eresby being daughter and sole heir of William Wil∣loughby the last Lord Willoughby of Eresby of his surname as is shewn in the pedigree of Lord Willoughby of Parham But this lady being most zealous for the Reformation in the reign of Edward VI Stephen Gardiner after that by Queen Mary he was restored to his bishoprick of Winchester sent for this Richard Bertie her husband in the first year of her reign and amongst some questions touching his religion asked "Whether the lady his wife was now as ready to set up mass as shed had been to pull it down when in her progress she caused a dog in a rocket to be carried and called by his name" Whereupon being advertised by his friends that the Bishop meant to call the Dutchess his wife to an account of her faith and foreseeing the danger he procured the Queen's licence to travel beyond sea under colour of looking after such debts as were due from the Emperor to the late Duke of Suffolk his lady's former husband And having obtained it passed the seas at Dover in June the same year leaving her behind who in January follow∣ing went disguised from her house in Barbican London and passing to Leigh in Essex privately took shipping and after much danger at sea met her husband at Santon in Cleveland where after some stay discerning that they were like to be questioned for their religion by the Bishop of Arras they were necessitated to haste away on foot with her daughter a child and two of the servants to Wesel a Hanse town in the dutchy of Cleveland but being got thither extremely weatherbeaten with rain and going from inn to inn to obtain lodging it was refused them by reason he was suspected for a lance Knight and she his woman resolving there∣fore to get shelter in the churchporch and to buy fuel to warm them there in their way hearing two young men speak Latin inquired of them in that language where they might go to some Walloon's house and were happily brought where Mr Perusel lodged who had formerly received some courtesies in England from this Dutchess By his means being kindly entertained they changed apparel with the good man and his wife and after hired a house in that town having got a pro∣tection from the magistrates for their stay there and here the Dutchess being brought  to bed of a son October he by reason of his birth in that country was christened Peregrine  But when they thought themselves happily settled intelligence was sent to Mr Bertie that it had been contrived in England to seize them there whereby they were obliged on a sudden to haste to a town called Winheim in the Palsgrave's dominions where they staid till their necessaries began to fail and then it provi∣dentially happened that Sigismund II King of Poland hearing of their distress invited them into his country  They set forth from Winheim in April and Philip and Mary but in their way underwent divers great hardships with no little danger of their lives by the Landgrave's soldiers who by reason of a quarrel for a spaniel which they had along with them thrust boarspears into the waggon where the Dutchess with her children and the other women were and upon pursuit of her husband into a village had murdered him but that he forsook his horse and ran up a ladder set to a garret window near the top of an house by which means escaping their sud∣den fury one of the Burghmasters came to him and brought another person who could speak Latin to whom submitting himself he presently dispatched letters to the Earl of Erbagh dwelling within eight miles who thereupon repairing thither shewed them such respect as properly belonged to persons of their quality And seeing the Earl's behaviour to them the authors of the fray got off and made all the friends they could to them not to report their usage in the worst manner After which they passed on quietly towards Poland where they received courteous enter∣tainment from the King and were honourably placed in the earldom of Crozan in Sanogela in which place having the absolute power of governing they continued in great quietness and honour till the death of Queen Mary and then returned into England  In Eliz waiting on the Queen to Cambridge when the Univeristy for five days entertained her with comedies tragedies and orations Mr Bertie had then the degree of Master of Arts conferred on him  He died in the sixtyfourth year of his age on April as the inquisition taken after his decease

service at the battle of Edgehill in the county of Warwick and was brought pri∣soner to Warwickcastle where he died the same night aged years and was buried at Edenham in com Linc The Earl of Clarendon gives him this charac∣ter "He was" says he "a man of great honour and spent the youth and vigour of his age in military actions and commands abroad and albeit he indulged to himself great liberties of life yet he still preserved a very good reputation with all men and a very great interest in his country as appears by the supplies he and his son brought to the King's army the companies of his own regiment of foot be∣ing commanded by the principal knights and gentlemen of Lincolnshire who engaged themselves in the service principally out of their personal affection to him He was of a very generous nature and punctual in what he undertook and in ex∣acting what was due to him which made him bear that restriction so heavily which was put upon him by the commission granted to Prince Rupert and by the King's preferring the Prince's opinion in all matters relating to the war before his Nor did he conceal his resentment for the day before the battle he said to some friends with whom he had used freedom that he did not look upon himself as Ge∣neral and therefore he was resolved when the day of battle should come that he would be at the head of his regiment as a private Colonel where he would die He was carried out of the field to the next village and if there could have been a surgeon procured it was thought his wound would not have proved mortal and as soon as the other army was composed by the coming on of the night the Earl of Essex about midnight sent Sir William Balfour and some other officers to see him and meant himself to visit him They found him upon a little straw in a poor house where they had laid him in his blood which had run from him in great abundance He said he was sorry to see so many gentlemen some whereof were his old friends engaged in so foul a rebellion wishing them to tell the Earl of Essex that he ought to throw himself at the King's feet to beg his pardon which if he did not speedily do his memory would be odious to the nation and continued this kind of discourse with such vehemence that the officers by degrees withdrew themselves and prevented the visit the Earl of Essex intended him who only sent him the best surgeons but in the very opening of his wounds he died before  morning by the loss of blood He had very many friends and few enemies and died generally lamented"  He married Elizabeth only child of Edward the first

death he with the Duke of Richmond the Marquis of Hertford and the Earl of Southampton generously offered themselves sacrifices for his Majesty's safety as having been by their office of

was served heir male and of talzie to Sir Richard Murray of Cockpool his brother german on the th of August was the first that had the titles of Viscount Annan and Earl of Annandale conferred on him He was first designed by the title of Lochmaben then of Dundrenan c and obtained several charters under the great seal by both these titles before he was advanced to the Peerage Being a man of singular accom∣plishment of great worth and merit and in high favour with King James VI was chosen one of his attendants to accompany him to England in He had the honour of Knighthood conferred on him soon after his arrival was made one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber and also appointed Master of the Horse  And was afterwards raised to the dignity of the Peerage by the titles of Viscount Annan and Earl of Annandale by letters patent to the heirs male of his body dated March He died in leaving issue by Elizabeth his Countess daughter of John Schaw Knight one son  JAMES SECOND EARL OF ANNANDALE who retired into England where he had lived privately during the time of the civil war in the reign of Charles I He succeeded also to the honours of Stormont according to the entail and patent of that family in He married Lady Elizabeth Carnegie daughter of James Earl of Southesk but dying without issue in December the ho∣nours of Annandale became extinct but those of Stormont devolved upon the next heir male according to the patent and substitution in the entail c c  JOHNSTON MARQUIS OF ANNANDALE  THE ancestors of the Johnstons on whom this title was conferred were a bold in∣trepid and hardy race of men and had always distinguished themselves for their bravery in the field and particularly so in repelling the inroads or invasions of the English borderers and with that spirit peculiar to the times never failed in aveng∣ing the injuries done either to their king or their country The time that this family began to make a figure in Scotland was in the reign of Alexander II about the year and they soon afterwards became numerous and powerful and were possessed of considerable estates in many different counties which appears from unquestion∣able documents and charters under the great seal in the public Register  Hugo de Johnston was proprietor of lands in EastLothian in the reign of King Alexander II and was father of  John de Johnston who made a donation to the monastery of Soltry  pro salute animae suae  of part of his lands in EastLothian of which it seems the family of Keith were superiors for the donation is confirmed by Robert de Keith Great Marishal of Scotland to which Dominus Ricardus de Keith his brother Adam de Keith his uncle John de Keith c are witnesses The confirmation is without date but appears to have been before the year  Thomas le Johnston Gilbert de Johnston and Wauter Johnston are all found swearing fealty to King Edward I of England  inter    et  but we can give no further account of their posterity  We therefore proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family from their un∣doubted ancestor  SIR JOHN DE JOHNSTON was one with others of the Scotch Barons that were forced to swear fealty to King Edward I when he had overrun Scotland anno and is then designed Johannes de Johnston Chevalier del comitat de Dum∣fries c The abovenamed Gilbert is thought to have been his brother Sir John was father of  JOHN DE JOHNSTON who flourished in the reign of King Robert Bruce and is particularly mentioned in a charter of Thomas Ranulph Earl of Murray of the lands and barony of Cumlangum which he gave to his nephew William de Moravia c the charter must have been granted before in which year the Earl died He left issue a son and successor  GILBERT DE JOHNSTON who is witness in the same charter with his father to William de Moravia and dying about the year was succeeded by his son  SIR JOHN DE JOHNSTON who made a great figure in the reigns of King David Bruce and King Robert II He engaged and defeated a large

afterwards very instrumental in suppressing the rebellion of the Earls of Douglas for which signal act of loyalty and firmness King James II rewarded him with a grant of the lands of Peddinane in Lanarkshire c  There is an instrument of seisin of the twenty merk land of Peddinane granted to Matthew de Johnston upon a precept from the chancery proceeding upon a charter from King James II dated November  This Matthew de Johnston styled Strenuus Armiger with his father's men were the principal means of suppressing the rebellion of the Earl of Douglas by taking with his own hand the Earl of Ormond Douglas's brother prisoner The Johnstons of Westerhall are lineally descended from him and bear with the family arms for difference in memory of that atchievement a Man's Heart ensigned with an Imperial Crown being a part of the armorial bearing of the house of Douglas  We find that Herbert de Johnston got several lands in the barony of Kirkmichael in Dumfriesshire from the Earl of Crawfurd for liberating his person out of the hands of James Earl of Douglas who had taken him captive believing he had in∣tended to desert his interest and espouse the King's anno  This Herbert was also proprietor of some lands in the barony of Bothwel which he resigned to James Lord Hamilton in exchange for the lands of Gladstanes c by a charter dated th May  Sir Adam was often one of the guarantees

and are equally celebrated in the annals of foreign nations as in the histories of England Scotland and Ireland  The first of this collateral branch with the title of Abercorn was James son of Lord Claud Hamilton third son of James second Earl of Arran in Scotland and Duke of Chatelherault in France by Lady Margaret Douglas eldest daugh∣ter of James Earl of Morton by whom he had four sons and four daughters  James Earl of Arran and Duke of Chatelherault who died without issue  Lord John who was the first Marquis of Hamilton and carried on the line of the family  Lord Claud the first of the family of Abercorn  The names of the other chil∣dren and their marriages will be given under the title of Duke of Hamilton  LORD CLAUD HAMILTON third son of James Earl of Arran and Duke of Chatelherault when very young was appointed Commendator of the abbacy of Paisley upon the resignation of John Archbishop of St Andrews anno which was ratified and approved by Pope Julius III He was a brave and gallant gentleman of steady honour and unchangeable integrity who by a series of vir∣tuous actions reflected lustre on his great ancestors During the melancholy dis∣cords that prevailed in Scotland under the unhappy reign of Queen Mary he adhered to her interest in all her misfortunes Prompted by his own innate bravery  and his loyalty to his royal mistress he appeared and distinguished himself in the last effort that was made in her cause at the battle of Langside anno In vain he displayed the skill and courage of a great commander the battle was lost and proved fatal to the queen's party  Immediately after the battle Lord Claud with many others were summoned to attend a parliament called together by the Earl of Murray then Regent and upon his refusal was outlawed and his estate forfeited  During the regency of the Earl of Mar his lands were given to Lord Semple who kept a strong garrison in his castle and exercised all around a severe military discipline displaying every violence and oppression that power could do to main∣tain a precarious possession At length this gallant Lord supported by his faith∣ful tenants rose in arms besieged the castle and obliged Lord Semple to surrender at discretion  During the minority of James VI Lord Claud with others of his family were particularly oppressed and so persecuted by the Regent Morton that he was obliged to fly to England for safety not daring to trust the prevailing faction though his for∣feiture had been repealed by the act of Parliament confirming the pacification of Perth anno But when the King took the management of affairs into his own hands and reflected on the different parties that divided the nation he soon per∣ceived that the flood of persecution that overwhelmed the Hamiltons was owing to no other cause than their zealous and steady attachment to his unhappy mother he therefore restored them to all their estates and honours and heaped many other favours upon them in particular he bestowed upon Lord Claud and his heirsmale or assignees by charter all the lordship and barony of Paisley with the appertinents belonging to the abbacy and monastery thereof anno And as a further testimony of his esteem and regard for him he was pleased in consideration of his constant loyalty great losses and sufferings to create him a Peer by the title of Lord Paisley anno  His Majesty likewise granted by another charter to Lord Claud Hamilton now Lord Paisley and his heirsmale whatever the barony and regality of the burgh of Paisley c anno  And by another charter the five pound land of Sanquahar c

derives his descent  Alexander  Elizabeth and  Margaret  John of the Isle the second son was seated at Dunniveg and Glynns in Argyle∣shire his descendants removed into the North of Ireland about the

buried him in ruinous church adjoining from whence the body was taken by Capt Piers who cut off the head and sent it to the Lord Deputy then at Drogheda who caused it to be fixed on the Castle of Dublin  By patent dated at Wesminster th April he was made free denizon of Ireland acknowledged the Queen's right to the country of Ulster and crown of Ire∣land professed obedience and swore to be a

DUNLUCE FIRST EARL OF AN∣TRIM eldest son of SorleyBoye for some time joined Tyrone in his rebellion but became a singular promoter and patron of civility in his country which was at that time uncultivated and overrun with the barbarous and savage customs of the wilder natives and when all the province of Ulster was in the flame of rebellion he joined Sir Arthur Chichester in August in his journey to the Lieutenant De∣puty at Tulloghoge offered to serve the Queen in the expedition against Tyrone to Fermanagh where he fled with foot and horse at his own charge made a free and voluntary submission to the Lieutenant Deputy Mountjoy and after being honoured by him with Knighthood demonstrated his fidelity by performing good  and acceptable sevice to the state of which King James I was so well satisfied that he rewarded him with a grant and confirmation to him and his heirsmale for ever with divers limitations by letters patent bearing date th May of all the countries and territories called the Route and the Glynnes and conferred upon him the dignity of a Viscount and in his warrant for passing the patent dated at Green∣wich th May thus expresseth himself "As it is a singular contentment to a King to see his subjects desire to excel each other in virtues and commendable courses so there is nothing that does more incite them to such honest contentions amongst themselves than the hopes of honour and advancements which being long since observed by us we have at all times heretofore rewared such of our subjects with titles of honour as we have found deserving servants of the commonwealth and now having taken into our consideration the many and faithful services which our trusty and wellbeloved Sir Randal MacDonnell Knt during the troubles of that kingdom hath as a valiant gentleman performed to our crown and how wisely and worthily he hath since behaved himself as well for the settling a general peace in that our kingdom as in reducing to civility the barbarous people of those parts where he doth reside we are graciously pleased as an especial mark of our favour towards him and a reward of his merits in both kinds to confer upon him the honour and dignity of a Viscount of that our realm and do hereby require you c" The patent was accordingly dated th June following and he was created Viscount of Dunluce in the presence chamber within the castle of Dublin by the Lieutenant Deputy St John on St Peter's day th June after a sermon preached on that oc∣casion and then carried the sword of state before his Lordship into the city to a grand entertainment which he had provided for him  His Majesty also called him into his Privycouncil gave him the command of a regiment in his army appointed him Lord Lieutenant of the county of Antrim and by letters patent under the Great Seal of England bearing date at Westminster th December advanced him to the dignity of Earl of Antrim with the an∣nual creation fee of l sterling  On the th of July he sat first in Parliament but on the th instant fol∣lowing had leave to go into the country during the session an account of his age and weakness however on th November following the first day of the second session he was again present and soon after he died at Dunluce on the th December  and was buried with his ancestors in Bonamargey He married Ellice daughter of Hugh MacaBaron O'Neile and sister to Hugh the Earl of Tyrone by whom he had two sons and five daughters viz  Randal created Marquis of Antrim  Alexander who succeeded to the Earldom  Daughter Lady Anne was first married to

Catharine in to Edward Plunket of Castle∣cor Esq son and heir to Patrick Lord Dunsany and  Lady Rose to Colonel Gordon who commanded a regiment in MajorGeneral Robert Monroe's army in the north  RANDAL THE SECOND EARL AND FIRST MARQUIS OF ANTRIM was born in the year Being a nobleman of an high spirit and great activity he carried a considerable aid in to King Charles in his first expedition against the Scots which being ended in a short time he attended his Majesty to Oxford from whence returning to Ireland he took his seat th June in the House of Peers and as Lord Clarendon writes lived in splendor till the rebellion drove his Lady again from thence who upon the Queen's first coming to Oxford accompanied her Majesty where she found great respect from all after which some false reports and aspersions were carried into England of the Earl's not only joining with the rebels but of being concerned in the very beginning of the rebellion but from that malicious charge Sir William Parsons one of the Lord Justices under whose eye he lived at that time in Dublin wrote into England a vindication of him and it is certain he was so far from being any ways engaged in the beginning of the rebellion that he retired with his Lady from Dublin soon after its commencement to the Earl of Castlehaven's seat at Maddenstown near Kildare and lived there some five or six months in peace and quiet until after the battle of Kilrush th April relieving and entertaining during that time many distressed Protestants of the neighbouring  country who doubtless must have perished had he not saved and sheltered them and such as were in want were sent to Dublin provided with both money and clothes  Soon after the said battle of Kilrush the people having threatened to pull down the house over his head he sent his Lady into England and going to his estate in where he arrived th April betook himself to the rebels in the north with an ima∣gination that his quality and fortune would give him the supreme power over them which he never intended to employ to the prejudice of the King as appeared plainly from this that though they were glad of his presence and to have his name known to be amongst them yet they had no confidence in him to advise or command them which proceeded chiefly from the freedom he took in expressing his detestation of their actions and measures and relieving the miseries and distresses of the British Protestants particularly those of Coleraine besieged by the Irish and in the utmost distress to whom he did all the good offices which either his rank consanguinity or religion could enable him to use with success endeavouring to engage the Irish to raise the siege and by letters entreated a parley which being granted he prevailed so far with their officers that they promised liberty to the people of the town to take grazing for their cattle safely for at least three miles compass after which his Lord∣ship sent into the town about threescore horses loaden with corn for the benefit of the inhabitants  Notwithstanding this service and that by his interest and among his tenants he raised a regiment yet MajorGeneral Monroe commander of the Scots forces on pretence that some other of his tenants were in the rebellion but in reality to gratify his own avarice by possessing his estate and plundering his house seized his person in May whilst he was entertaining him in his castle of Dunluce and sent him prisoner to Carrickfergus whence having the good fortune to make his escape into the northern parts of England he waited on the Queen then at York who to promote the cessation of arms with the Irish then become absolutely necessary by the extremities to which the army was reduced sent his Lordship to Ireland with letters and instructions to that purpose but he was again taken by Monroe the very instant of his landing in the county of Downe and imprisoned in Carrickfergus  After some months restraint he recovered his liberty by a second escape into Eng∣land and arrived at Oxford th December where his presence was not unac∣ceptable Monroe all the while enjoying his estate and refusing to allow him or his  agents to receive the rents of it though repeated orders were sent from the King and the state of Ireland for that purpose  He was no sooner arrived at Oxford but the Marquis of Montrose proposing a scheme for raising such a body of the King's friends in Scotland to oppose the Cove∣nanters who were then in a treaty with the Parliament as should oblige the Scots army to return out of England if he had but some troops to begin with and to serve for a pretension to the Royalists that should join him consulted with the Earl of Antrim whether it might not be possible to draw a body of men out of Ireland to be such a foundation for raising the said forces in Scotland as might advance the enterprise he had so long inhis heart of doing the King service in the north and protecting the Royalists that would join him in his undertaking The Earl of Antrim readily un∣dertook that if the King would grant him a commission he would raise an army in Ireland and transport it into Scotland and would himself be at the head of it by means whereof all the clan of the MacDonnells in the Highlands might be per∣suaded to follow him  Upon this overture the King conferred with the two noblemen together and knowing well that the Earl of Antrim had interest enough to raise as many men as should be desired in that part of the kingdom his Majesty resolved to encourage it all he could which he did by creating him Marquis of Antrim by Privyseal dated at Oxford th January Car I with the creation fee of l a year issuing out of the customs of the port of Coleraine Having received this ho∣nour and the King's commission he began his journey to raise the intended forces to be sent into Scotland in April but in the execution of his designs unfore∣seen difficulties often arising to retard them he could not raise them so expeditiously nor make good his undertaking effectually without the assistance or countenance of the supreme council at Kilkenny to recommend himself to whom he took the oath of association and was made a member of that body whereby with the Marquis of Ormond's concurrence he sent off th June about men under the com∣mand of Colonel Alexander MacDonnell who landing about the end of July in the islands were recieved by the Marquis of Montrose and by their brave behaviour laid the foundation of all the great enterprises he undertook and the amazing victories he gained in all which they constantly accompanied him  From this time till the month of February we have no public mention of  the Marquis of Antrim when he was appointed by the general assembly at Kilkenny one of their three agents to the Queen and Prince in France to desire a Lord Lieute∣nant might be sent into Ireland He returned in September th of which month the Marquis of Ormond landed Lord Lieutenant at Cork and th January concluded a peace with the supreme council but the Pope's nuncio declaring against it he was soon forced again to leave the kingdom yet the Marquis of Antrim and Owen O'Neile adhering to him stood it out against the peace and at length the Marquis entered into an intrigue with Cromwell from whom in he had an assignment of l a year and his protection from being arrested or imprisoned dur∣ing his stay in the Parliament's quarters having in l per annum allowed him yet he did not forget his duty to his Prince which he expressed by assisting him with arms and ammunition when he was in the west of England and after his forces were defeated at Worcester furnished him with ships to make his escape into foreign parts For which and other considerations he was retored to his estate by the acts of settlement and at length after much difficulty received a confirmation thereof by two patents under the Great Seal  He married to his first wife in April the Lady Catharine Manners daugh∣ter and heir to Francis Earl of Rutland widow of George Villiers the great Duke of Buckingham and to his second Rose daughter of Sir Henry O'Neile of Eden∣duffecarrick otherwise Shane's Castle in the county of Antrim Knight by his wife Martha daughter of Sir Francis Stafford Governor of Ulster but having no issue by either and dying the d February he was buried in Bonamargey the title of Marquis became extinct and the Earldom devolved on his brother  ALEXANDER THE THIRD EARL OF ANTRIM who was born in the year and being twentyone years of age at his father's death travelled into France Germany Italy and other places whence arriving about the beginning of the troubles of he waited on the King at York after which he returned to Ire∣land and sided with the Irish of his own religion in

Anchitel son of Piers Lord of Esburnham was Sheriff of the counties of Surry Sussex and Kent and Constable of Dover Castle in the reign of King Harold which castle he defended against William the Conqueror wherefore William on his accession to the crown of England caused his head to be struck off together with the heads of his sons Phillip and Michael de Esburnham Francis Thyn Esq in collected a catalogue of the Lordwardens of the Cinque Ports and Constables of Dover Castle from the time of William the Conqueror and makes this mention of the ancestor of this family "Bertram Ashburnham a Baron of Kent was Constable of Dover Castle in the year of Christ being as is said the first and last year of King Harold which Bertram was beheaded by Wil∣liam the Conqueror after he had obtained the crown because he did so valiantly de∣fend the same against the Duke of Normandy"  Philip de Esburnham left issue Reginald whose son Stephen de Esburnham confirms to the church of St Martin of Battle

Chief Justice of the Common Pleas her second husband  Of John the eldest son hereafter  William Ashburnham the second son served in his youth in the service of the StatesGeneral against the Spaniards in the Netherlands and being an excellent sol∣dier had a principal command in that army raised by King Charles to march against the Scots He was member in the two parliaments summoned in and in the latter was examined on oath whether he knew any thing of that plot charged on the officers of the army for petitioning the King c which he denied nerver∣theless the parliament voted that he should receive no pay Standing thus in great umbrage with the parliament by whom he was in the sequel expelled with other loyal members and the King's affairs not yet permitting him to make use of his ser∣vice he to avoid the clamour that was raised against him embarked on board a small flyboat for Holland with some other officers who removed on the same account They had not been long at sea before they met with one of his Majesty's ships bring∣ing ammunition to his assistance on which it was agreed that Mr Ashburnham and the Lord Digby should proceed on their voyage and the others should return with the ammunition but whilst this was agitating the parliament squadron came up and though the ship escaped yet the flyboat was taken and carried into Hull where he was taken with the Lord Digby who concealed himself under the disguise of a Frenchman till he sound a convenient opportunity to reveal himself to the Go∣vernor Sir John Hotham whom he prevailed with to espouse his Majesty's interest  and to surrender Hull which design being at length rendered fruitless Colonel Ashburnham and the Lord Digby were dismissed by the Governor and was the principal cause as Lord Clarendon writes of the loss of Sir John's head  Mr Ashburnham came to his Majesty about the time he set up his standard at Nottingham which was on August d and entered on action with the first repairing to the Marquis of Hertford at Sherburn where with a small force having kept that castle several weeks without being incommoded by the Earl of Bedford who watched them with a much greater army they marched from thence to Minehead and there the Marquis with some other gentlemen transported themselve into Wales leaving this Colonel Ashburnham with Sir Ralph Hopton and others to march into Cornwal There they raised forces with such activity that in a small time they made themselves masters of the West and having performed very consider∣able services joined Prince Maurine at Chard in Somersetshire about the middle of June with an army of foot horse and dragoons of which Colonel Ashburnham had been MajorGeneral  He was soon after made Governor of Weymouth on the opinion of his courage and dexterity as the Earl of Clarendon writes and to make way for him Sir An∣thonyAshley Cooper was removed from that command He was made ColonelGeneral of the county of Dorset and in the year having received express or∣ders from Prince Maurice to quit all places that he conceived not tenable in case an army should advance into those parts he about June th on the Earl of Essex's marching towards him quitted Weymouth and retired to Portland Castle where he endured a siege of about four months with great patience and resolution suffering both by the want of men and provisions until he was relieved by the Earl of Cleve∣land and Sir Walter Hastings appointed Governor in his room However being censured for quiting of Weymouth he at his own request had a public hearing be∣fore his Majesty and the council to whom he so fully stated the matter of fact as Sir Edward Walker writes in his history of the progress of the King's forces and the impossibility of keeping that place in case an army did attempt it together with his reasons for retiring to Portland and how he disposed of his Majesty's arms and am∣munition as that in the opinion of all there he was cleared from any crime or neglect  After the restoration he was made Cofferer to Charles II and dying without issue in December was buried in the church of Ashburnham in Sussex where a  noble monument of white marble is erected to his memory with his effigy in a Roman dress and the effigy of his lady in white marble reposing her right arm on a cushion an angel holding a wreath on her head And in a compartment of white marble is this inscription  "Under this Tomb viz in the vault for this family lie the bodies of Jane Countess of Marlborough and William Ashburnham her husband second son of Sir John Ashburnham She was daughter to John Lord Butler of Hertfordshire she was married first to James Earl of Marlborough Lord High Treasurer of England who after seven years died and left her a young beauti∣ful and rich widow When this William coming from beyond sea where he was bred a soldier married her and after lived almost five and forty years most happily with her She was a very great lover and through God's mercy a great blessing to this family which is hoped will ever remember it with honouring her memory This William Ashburnham her husband lived after her to a great age and gloried in nothing in this world but this his wife and the almost unparalleled love and entire friendship that for above years was between his dear elder brother John Ashburnham and himself He was Cofferer to King Charles the First and King Charles the Second He died without issue and by God's blessing was a happy preserver of his brother's posterity  The praise and glory of it be to God alone"  John Ashburnham eldest son and heir of Sir John and brother to William Ashburnham last mentioned was one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber to Charles I and in was elected to parliament for the port of Hastings He attended on his Majesty during the rebellion and his behaviour was so satisfactory that the King had an entire confidence in him and was pleased to nominate him in one of his Commissioners for the Treaty at Uxbridge Also in the King desired of the parliament that a safe conduct might be granted to the Duke of Richmond the Earl of Southampton Mr John Ashburnham and Mr Jeffery Palmer to come to Westminster with his propositions for peace And he was also one with others appointed by his Majesty to commit the militia for such time and with such power as expressed by his Commissioners at Uxbridge  On April th when his Majesty thought proper to leave Oxford Mr Ash∣burnham  was the only servant that attended him and indeed the only person ex∣cepted a clergyman Dr Hudson who served as a guide Afterwards when the King was in the hands of the Scots army he transported himself to France with his Majes∣ty's approbation the Scots threatening to deliver him to the parliament and had forbid him his Majesty's presence But when he heard the King was in the hands of the English army and that there was not the same restraint as formerly he resolved to make an adventure to wait on him and having by some friends a recommendation both to Cromwell and Ireton who knew the credit he had with the King and that his Majesty would be very well pleased to have his attendance and look on it as a testimony of their respect to him he was left at liberty to repair to the King and was very welcome to his Majesty He and Sir John Berkeley who came from France at the same time were the two principal agents for conferring both with his Majesty's friends and with the officers of the army as often as they desired But the army having got the sole power and subdued all opposition from the parliament as well as the city they began not only to be less regardful of these his Majesty's agents but even of the King himself who therefore resolved to make his escape Mr Ashburham was chiefly confided in and he and Sir John Berkeley having passes sent them to go beyond the seas contrived means for his Majesty's escape from HamptonCourt which was effected on November th and having con∣ducted the King to the seacoast they were sent to treat with Colonel Hammond Governor of the Isle of Wight to take the King into his protection which he seemed to comply with but by a fatal mistake of this man's honour that unhappy Prince was delivered into the hands of the army This occasioned a suspicion of Mr Ash∣burnham's as well as Berkeley's fidelity but it chiefly lay on the former because as Lord Clarendon writes it was inferred he was known to have so great an influence on his Majesty's councils and resolutions that he could not be ignorant of any thing that moved him  Yet Lord Clarendon who discourses largely of this affair sufficiently clears Mr Ashburnham from the imputation laid to his charge saying "That he preserved his reputation and credit with the most eminent of the King's party and his remaining in England after the death of the King which his enemies charged as an aggravation of suspicion against him was upon the marriage of a lady by whom he had a great fortune and many conveniencies which would have been seized by his leaving the  kingdom and he did send over to King Charles II and had leave to stay there and sometimes supplied the King with considerable sums of money Afterwards he was committed to the Tower by Cromwell where he remained till his death and the King was known to the last to have had a clear opinion of his affection and integri∣ty and when King Charles II returned most of those of the greatest reputation as the Marquis of Hertford and the Earl of Southampton gave him a good testimony  Upon the whole says the same historian it is probable that Cromwell who many years after committed him to the Tower and did hate him and desired to have taken his life would have been glad to have blasted his reputation by declaring that he had carried his master to the Isle of Wight without his privity merely upon his own presumption Besides he was a person of unblemished honour and vera∣city and had not any temptation and never gave any cause in the subsequent actions of his life to have his fidelity suspected"  In a manuscript I have seen wrote by this Mr Ashburnham in his own vindi∣cation he thus expresses himself 'And though for no other motive yet for this that my own posterity may know I have not stupidly through silence passed by the heavy censures upon me there shall be for their information this faithful discourse extant to settle their judgments of my integrity to his Majesty and prevent the irre∣verence which otherwise may perhaps not only be paid to them to my memory but give them cause taking loose reports for granted truths to loath themselves for be∣ing branches of so unworthy and wicked a stock  'If men would but as well consider the painful and vexatious partimposed on me during all the wars as they look upon the privileges I enjoyed by my near relation to his Majesty's service they would find more cause to pity me for my labours than to envy me for the honour or profit of my employments for from the time his Majesty went last from London to the time he left Oxford to go to the Scots army I will confidently affirm I lived as painful and as servile a life as any whoever he was of the meanest degree But I hope that an unhappy fate which hath hitherto followed me will at least leave me in this so that I may not be understood to repine at the hardships of my duty Had the travel of my body or mind been much more beset with toils and difficulties I should with the same chearfulness have waded through all when in the least measure there had been question of pursuing his Majesty's interest It is no part of my intentions to adventure upon the history of the unfor∣tunate  divisions between his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament my business being only to deliver so much as my duty was particularly concerned in when his Majesty was pleased to remove from Oxford to the Scots army and from Hampton Court to the Isle of Wight and not to trouble myself or others with more than what is pertinent to the suppressing those false and horrid aspersions cast upon my fidelity in both these actions wherein I shall be careful that nothing shall fall from me the truth whereof I will not be ready at all times to justify with my life  'To wave therefore all things that passed between his Majesty the two Houses of Parliament and their armies till the month of April I hold it fit to give the state of things that when his Majesty's forces were reduced to the last period which I take to be the time that Oxford was besieged it was judged necessary by all considering men that his sacred person should not be liable to the success of an assault for con∣ditions or treaties seemed vain to be expected where the King was but that some ex∣pedient should be found by escape from thence to save his life though nothing could be thought on in order to his flight that in point of danger kept not equal pace with the hazard of his stay Notwithstanding it was then first debated as the King was pleased to tell me whether it were not better for his Majesty to stay than leave Ox∣ford c'  After the Restoration he was restored to his former post of Groom of the Bed∣chamber and was elected one of the Knights of the shire for Sussex to that parlia∣ment which met at Westminster anno He lies buried in the chancel of Ash∣burnham church under a noble monument of black and white marble whereon lies the effigies in full proportion of a gentleman in armour between his two wives the one in a windingsheet and the other in a baroness's robe with a coronet on her head all their hands elevated and underneath are the figures of four sons and four daugh∣ters kneeling before a desk Over all in an arch of white marble supported by two black marble pillars is the following inscription on black marble in gilt Roman letters  Here lies in the vault underneath John Ashburnham Esq of this place son to the unfortunate person Sir John Ashburnham whose good nature and frank disposition towards his friends in being deeply engaged for them necessitated him to sell this place in his family long before the conquest and all the estate he had elsewhere not leaving to his wife and six children the least substance  which is not inserted to the least disadvantage of his memory God forbid it should be understood to be a charge of disrespect upon him but to give God the praise who so suddenly provided both for his wife and children as that within less than two years after the death of the said Sir John there was not any of them but was in condition rather to be helpful to others than to want support themselves May God be pleased to add this blessing to his posterity that they may never be unmindful of the great things he hath done for them The wife of the said Sir John Ashburnham was daughter to Sir Thomas Beaumont of Staughton in the county of Leicester she was very eminent for her great temper and prudence She died in the seventyfifth year of her age and both the said Sir John and his wife lie buried in the church of St Andrew's in Holborn London  The said Mr John Ashburnham married the daughter and heir of William Holland of Westburton in this county Esq who lies also here interred and by whom he had these eight children She made the first step towards the re∣covery of some part of the inheritance wasted by the said Sir John for she sold her whole estate to lay out the money in this place She lived in great repu∣tation for piety and discretion and died in the seven and thirtieth year of her age The second wife to the said Mr John Ashburnham who lies also here interred was the widow of the Lord Poulett of Hinton St George in the county fo Somerset She was daughter and heir to Christopher Kenn of Kenn in that county Esq who left her a great estate in lands now in the possession of the Lord Poulett She was worthy imitation by all her sex for her honourable and religious conversation she brought great advantages to the family of this place and died at the age of seventy years and four months and her memory is pre∣cious to all considering persons that knew her This Mr John Ashburnham was of the Bedchamber to their Majesties Charles I and Charles II who when he had performed the service to God in building this church at his own charge died in the sixtyeighth year of his age on the fifteenth day of June in the year of our Lord  Frances

person of such note and valour and so much confided in by William Duke of Normandy that after his victory obtained on October th over Harold King of England he sent him to subdue the northern parts of that realm which having successfully performed he was rewarded with no less than fortythree lord∣ships in the East and WestRidings of Yorkshire and fiftyone in the NorthRiding of that county where the manor and castle of Skelton was the capital of his barony He likewise obtained by conquest and other ways Hert and Hertness in the bishoprick of Durham This Robert died about the year according to some writers but according to others about the year and left issue a son and successor  ROBERT DE BRUIS SECOND LORD OF SKELTON a man of great worth and honour who contracted a great friendship with David I King of Scotland while that monarch remained in England where he was styled Earl and Prince of Cumberland during the reign of Alexander I his brother and predecessor and was also Earl of Northumberland Huntingdon and Northampton in right of his con∣sort Mathilda or Maud daughter of the renowned Earl Waltheof This Robert de Bruis accompanied King David into Scotland and was accounted one of his no∣bles and subjects as is evident from the register of he bishoprick of Glasgow where it is recited that David by writ between the years and gave  centum soli∣dorum  in  Hardingestra in Northamptonshire for repairing the church of Glasgow with the consent of Mathilda his wife  et procerum et militum meorum Roberti de Brus  c It is equally evident from sundry documents that the same Robert was pos∣sessed on the lordship of Annandale which contained all the lands from the bounds of Dunnegal and Strathnith to the lands of Ranulph de Meschines then Earl of Chester and Lord of Cumberland and it is affirmed by some historians that by the mediation of King David he obtained them in marriage with Agnes Annand heir∣ess of that vast estate of which he got confirmation from that monarch and thereby had large possessions in both kingdoms As he was a man of great parts and equally qualified for the cabinet and the field he was in high favour with Henry I King of England as well as with the said David King of Scotland Being at the court of England A D King Stephen joined him in commission with Ber∣nard de Baliol to endeavour to dissuade or divert King David from his intended in∣vasion of England and Robert used all his interest with the Scottish monarch but to no purpose for that prince neglecting the advice pursued his former resolutions and entered England with a considerable army Upon that Robert withdrew his allegiance from David and was on the English side at the famous battle of the Stan∣dard which proved fatal to the Scots and was fought in near Northalverton or Northallerton in Yorkshire In this action Robert de Brus took prisoner his own son Robert who had been left in Scotland and was then about years of age When the father presented him to King Stephen his majesty desired that he might be delivered to his nurse to be taken care of an Sir William Dugdale says he was more fit to be eating wheatbread with his mother than by force of arms to be defend∣ing his patrimony of Annandale c However peace being concluded next year between the two kingdoms in consequence of which Northumberland was given to Henry Prince of Scotland Robert continued in favour and friendship with King David ever after  This Robert was very eminent for his piety and devotion having in Henry I as appears by Sir William Dugdale's Monasticon founded a monastery for canons regular of St Augustine at Gysburn or Gisburne commonly called Gisborough in Cleveland Agnes his wife and Adam his son and heir joining with him therein amply endowing it with carucates of land each carucate then con∣taining acres This monastery was the common burialplace of the nobility and  persons of rank in those parts and its church by the ruins seems to have been

Annandiae c  The charter is without date but by the names of the witnesses must have been granted between the years and This William de Bruce died before the year and was succeeded by his son  ROBERT THIRD LORD OF ANNANDALE a nobleman of great valour and magnanimity and at the same time both pious and religious He ratified and confirmed to the monastery of Gisburne all the grants of his

descendants in her right notwithstanding her illegitimacy put in his claim at the aftermentioned competition for the Scottish crown and from whom the Rosses of Hamlake and Warke are descended he left at his death A D an only son and heir  ROBERT DE BRUISE surnamed the Noble FOURTH LORD OF AN∣NANDALE who married Isabel second daughter of Prince David Earl of Hun∣tingdon and Chester who was son of Henry Prince of Scotland eldest son of Da∣vid King of Scotland and younger brother to Malcolm IV and William the Lion successively monarchs of that realm the latter being father of King Alexan∣der II whose son Alexander III dying without issue male on March th A D the undoubted right of succession to the Scottish sovereignty devolved upon his granddaughter Margaret commonly called the Maid of Norway she be∣ing daughter to Eric II monarch of that realm by his consort Margaret daughter to the last mentioned Alexander By this royal match the Lords of Annandale came to be amongst the greatest subjects in Europe for by the said Isabel who was one of three sisters and coheiresses of John surnamed Scot Earl of Huntingdon and last Count Palatine of Chester of which palatinate he John became possessed in right of his mother Maud the aforesaid Prince David's wife daughter of Hugh Kiviliock and eldest sister of Ranulph Blundeville Earls Palatines of Chester Robert exclu∣sive of his paternal estate in both kingdoms came to be possessed of the manor of Writtle and Hatfield in Essex together with half the hundred of Hatfield which King Henry III in the th year of his reign gave in exchange for those lands which descended to his lady by the death of her brother John Earl Palatine of Chester and she likewise brought him the castle of Kildrummie and the lordship of Garioch in Aberdeenshire and the manors of Connington in Huntingdonshire and Exton in Rutlandshire which three she inherited from her father This great peer died in an advanced age A D and had sepulture with his ancestors under a stately monument at Gisburne leaving by the said Isabel a son and successor  ROBERT DE BRUS FIFTH LORD OF ANNANDALE who was one of the Justices of the Common Pleas in Henry III and in Henry III doing his homage had livery of the lands of his mother's inheritance In Henry III as one of the coheirs to John Scot Earl of Huntingdon on assessment of the aid for making the king's eldest son knight he paid twenty pound for ten knights' fees which he had  of the honour of Peverell of London in the counties of Essex and Hertford In Henry III he was constituted Sheriff of Cumberland and Governor of the castle of Carlisle In Henry III when many of the Barons put themselves in arms on pretence of asserting the laws of the land and the people's liberties he was one of those who stood firm to the king and marched with him from Oxford to Northampton where the rebellious Barons then were with a great power and on the assault of that town took several prisoners But soon after on May th when the Barons through the help of the Londoners gave battle to the King at Lewes in Sussex where they prevailed he was together with the King himself and divers other great lords taken prisoner having at that time together with John Cumming the command of those Scottish auxiliaries which were then there in King Henry's service But the King obtaining his right by the victory at Evesham on August th the th of his reign he was in Henry III again made Governor of the castle of Carlisle  In Edward I after the death of Margaret Queen of Scotland daughter of Eric II King of Norway and granddaughter and undoubted heir to Alexander III before mentioned he was one of the competitors for the Scottish crown with John Baliol the other claimants suits being set aside when the right of succession was declared to be betwixt these two candidates It was alledged among other arguments for Robert Bruce that it was customary in Scotland for the brother of the last king to be preferred to his son and adduced an example of Donald V's succeeding to the throne A D in preference to King Constantine II the son of his elder brother King Kenneth II commonly called Mac Alpin that King Alexander II who died in esteemed Robert as his heir in failure of the descendants of his own body even to the knowledge of Dornagild or Derveguld his Robert's mother's eldest sister and John Baliol's mother who was then alive and assented to it at least did not contradict it having no male issue of her own that it was a con∣stant maxim in Scotland for the son of the second daughter to be preferred to the heir female of the eldest daughter and that King Alexander III acknowledged this Robert to be next heir to the crown failing heirs of his own body all which was offered to be proved by living witnesses It was urged for John Baliol that he stood one degree nearer in consanguinity to David Earl of Huntingdon his grandmother Margaret being eldest daughter of that Prince and that consequently the crown be∣longed  to him On that principle though the learned Mr Thomas Ruddiman has clearly proved the right of representation according to the then rules of succession to have been in Bruce the forty chosen peers twenty of Scotland and as many of England did at the tenth congress in the castle of Berwick on November th declare John Baliol King of Scotland by the direction of Edward I King of England who acted as umpire After that decision Robert Bruce and John Hastings Lord Bergavenny who had been one of the competitors in right of his grandmother Ada fourth and youngest daughter of the aforesaid David Earl of Huntingdon claimed each a third part of the kingdom but were rejected This Robert was so dissatisfied with the determination that the could never be prevailed upon either to give up his title or to acknowledge King Edward superior or John Baliol King of Scotland and retired in great disgust to England where however he did not long remain but returned to his castle of Lochmaben He died there in and was buried with his ancestors in the abbey of Gisburne  He married Isabel daughter of Gilbert de Clare Earl of Gloucester and by her had three sons  Robert his heir  Sir Bernard Bruce who got the lands of Con∣nington in Huntingdonshire and Exton in Rutlandshire which about the end of the reign of Edward III went in marriage with Anne the sole heiress of this branch of the illustrious house of Bruce to Sir Hugh Wessenham from whose family it came in like manner by an heiress Mary to William Cotton Esq from whom after several generations descended that eminent antiquary Sir Robert Cotton Baronet whose male line terminated in the late Sir John Bruce Cotton of Connington in Hun∣tingdonshire and Stretton in Bedfordshire who inherited all the virtues of his ances∣tors and left four daughters his coheirs viz Jane wedded to Thomas Hart of War∣field in Berkshire Esq Elizabeth to Bowdler Esq Mary to Basil now Earl of Denbigh and Francis who is unmarried and  John de Bruis or Bruce of whom afterwards as ancestor to the late Earl of Ailesbury  Robert the com∣petitor had also by his said wife a daughter Christian married to Patrick Dunbar eighth Earl of March  ROBERT BRUCE the eldest son AND SIXTH LORD OF ANNANDALE attended Prince Edward afterwards King Edward I into Palestine where by his courage and conduct he acquired great honour Upon his return from that expedition he retired into England where he had a considerable estate In Edward I  he was made Governor of the castle of Carlisle and in that and the two succeeding years had summons to parliament among the English Barons In the last of those years being called Robert de Bruce senior in regard to his eldest son Robert of whom afterwards King Edward acknowledging his constant fidelity ordered him to be put in possession of his lands in Scotland He would never acknowledge the title of John Baliol but being cajoled into the interest of King Edward with the hopes of at∣taining the Scottish crown by that monarch's assistance he contributed together with his son aforesaid to the English obtaining the victory at Dunbar A D after which putting Edward in mind of his promise he received such an answer as convinced him how little he had to expect from that quarter Nevertheless being constrained to accompany King Edward in his future operations he and his said son were with him at the battle of Falkirk on July d when the Scots were also defeated After that action he is said to have had an interview with the re∣nowned Sir William Wallace one of the Scottish commanders and to have been so much affected with the discourse of that great man that he resolved to assert his own right and rescue his country but he never had a proper opportunity  He married Margaret Countess of Carrick daughter and sole heir of Neil Earl of Carrick and widow of Adam de Kilconath who in her right was Earl of Carrick and having accompanied this Robert to the Holy Land died there without issue in and by her in whose right he also became Earl of Carrick had five sons  Robert his heir afterwards King of Scotland by the name of Robert I  Sir Ed∣ward de Bruce who signalizing himself in behalf of his elder brother was by him created Earl of Carrick and being invited by a considerable number of the Irish to be their king was crowned at Dundalk but was defeated and slain there A D after a reign of about three years checkered with various success leaving three natural sons viz Robert Earl of Carrick who was killed without issue at the battle of Dupplin in Alexander who then became Earl of Carrick but sell at Hallidonhill A D leaving an only daughter Helen Countess of Carrick who wedded Sir William Cunningham of Kilmaurs but had no progeny and Thomas who upon her death was Earl of Carrick and distinguished himself in the cause of his country but left no children  Neil de Bruce  Thomas de Bruce and  Alexander de Bruce who were all three put to death by command of King Edward I  Robert by the same lady had likewise seven daughters  Lady Isabel wedded st to Tho Randolph of Strathdon L H Chamb of Scotland whose son Thomas was before Earl of Murray Lord of Annandale and of the Isle of Man and rendered himself one of the greatest heroes of his age both before and after he was guardian of Scotland during the minority of King David II dly to the Earl of Athole and dly to Alexander Bruce  Lady Mary who had two husbands st Sir Neil Campbell ancestor to the Duke of Argyle and dly Sir Alexander Fra∣ser Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland from whom the Lords Salton Lovat c  Lady Christian who was first married to Gratney Marr the th Earl of Marr who had with her the castle of Kildrummie and lordship of Garioch as appears by a charter from her brother King Robert I dly to Sir Christopher Seton ancestor to the Earls of Winton and dly to Sir Andrew Moray Lord Bothwell Chancel∣lor and Governor of Scotland  Lady Matilda wedded to Hugh Earl of Ross  Lady Elizabeth to Sir William Dishington of Ardoss  Lady Margaret to Sir William Carlyle of Torthorald and  Lady to David de Bre∣chin third Lord Brechin grandson of Henry de Brechin natural son of David Earl of Huntingdon beforementioned  Robert their father died in and was suc∣ceeded by his eldest son  ROBERT EARL OF CARRICK AND SEVENTH LORD OF ANNAN∣DALE who though obliged to temporize and adhere to King Edward as he had a considerable estate in England yet he never lost view of his right to the Scottish monarchy When he judged the time favourable for his purpose he communicated his intention to some of his professed friends and as John Cumming Lord of Bade∣noch was though sister's son to John Baliol among the number and one of the most powerful men in Scotland Robert in order to secure him effectually to his in∣terest agreed to make over to him all his paternal inheritance in that kingdom pro∣vided he would assist him to ascend the throne Cumming readily embraced the offer as in case of a revolution in favour of Bruce he would have been in a situation little inferior to royal but at last doubting the success of the enterprize or actuated by the hopes of an ample reward or perhaps of obtaining the crown for himself John Baliol having been dethroned by King Edward about nine years before and then living in exile he disclosed the whole transaction to the King of England Robert Bruce was then at London and had such early notice of his being betrayed that  he made his escape to Scotland though not without some hazard and difficulty At his arrival there his partizans were so enraged at Cumming's treachery that some of them on February th put him to death in the church of Dumfries whither conscious of his guilt he had fled for refuge but neither the church nor the altar were allowed to be a sanctuary for such perfidy and treason Robert having then collected a small body of men proceeded to his palace of Scoon where he was crowned on PalmSunday March th He had enjoyed his royalty but a short space when he was attacked and defeated by an army sent against him by King Edward I after which he experienced various turns of fortune some of which seemed very unpropitious to his affairs He was obliged to live in an obscure condition for a considerable time during which his enemies tried every method their invention could suggest either to captivate or destroy him but being endowed with a large share of magnanimity and sagacity and his partizans being likewise possessed of the same qualities as well as an inviolable fidelity all the schemes against him proved abortive In a few years he became absolute master of Scotland of which he not only secured quiet and respectable possession by the signal victory obtained at Ban∣nockburn on June th over a numerous army commanded by King Edward II but was also enabled to carry the war with success into the territories of his adver∣sary The Scottish historians considering this monarch as the deliverer of his coun∣try from foreign subjection and the restorer of its independency characterize him as a prince qualified equally for the cabinet and field and exclusive of the many heroes produced by his family sufficient not only to render it but even a whole kingdom illustrious His Majesty was twice married st to Isabel daughter of Donald tenth Earl of Marr and sister to the aforesaid Gratney Earl of Marr and dly to Eliza∣beth daughter to Henry de Burgh Earl of Ulster in Ireland By the first he had a daughter Marjory wedded to Walter Lord High Steward of Scotland who by her was father of a son Robert Stewart afterwards monarch of that kingdom by the name of Robert II and also of a daughter Egidia or Giles married to Sir James Lind∣say of Crawford King Robert by his second consort daughter to the Earl of Ul∣ster had an only son David his successor and likewise three daughters  Marga∣ret espoused to William fifth Earl of Sutherland from whom the present Earl  Mathilda wedded to Thomas de Issac whose daughter Jane was married to John de Ergadia Lord of Lorn from whom by a coheiress descended the Lords  Lorn and Innermeath the Earls of Athole Buchan and Traquair of the surname of Stewart and the present Sir John Stewart of Garntully Baronet and  Eliza∣beth wedded to Sir Walter Oliphant ancestor to the present Lord Oliphant  King Robert departed this life on June th and his only son beforemen∣tioned mounted the Scottish throne by the name of DAVID II who was then in the ninth year of his age and lately espoused to Johanna sister to King Edward III of England The tranquillity of his reign was soon disturbed by Edward John Baliol's son who landing in Scotland A D accompanied by divers English noblemen claiming lands in that kingdom and being reinforced by the adherents of his family routed the Bruceans and got himself crowned king This disaster together with the discomfiture of the Scottish army next year at Hallidonhill obliged the regents to send David and his queen to France However his partizans acted with such perseverance that they expelled Edward Baliol and David returned to Scotland on May d After his reestablishment he made several expedi∣tions into England to make a diversion in favour of the French but on October th his army was routed and himself wounded and taken prisoner at Nevil's Cross near Durham Several treaties were set on foot for his liberty but none took effect till when he was ransomed for marks sterling King David was twice married st to the beforementioned Johanna daughter of Edward II King of England and dly to Jane daughter some say widow of Sir John Logie of Logie but having no issue by either at his death on February th the crown devolved to his nephew Robert Stewart before taken notice of whose right upon the decease of the said Edward Baliol without heirs of his body became un∣questionable in the strictest sense of hereditary succession and from him his present Majesty is descended  Having thus deduced the principal male branch of this family Lord Bruce's col∣lateral relations we return to JOHN DE BRUIS or BRUCE third son of RO∣BERT FIFTH LORD OF ANNANDALE competitor for the crown of Scotland his Lordship's immediate ancestor Sir Robert grandson of this John is styled be∣loved and faithful cousin by King David II son of King Robert I in a charter dated December th which he got

on January th David II got a charter of the lands of Rait in Perthshire with the same limi∣tation as in the foregoing charter being called in both the King's beloved cousin a designation to which he was justly entitled being the nearest relation of the name of Bruce to the royal family This gentleman from whom every person of the surname of Bruce is descended bore the arms of the Lords of Annandale his ancestors viz Or a chief and saltire Gules with a star or mullet on the chief to denote his descent from a third son of that illustrious house but his posterity upon the extinction of the elder male branches laid aside the star and carried the arms simply as undoubted chiefs of the whole name Sir Robert married Dame Isabel Stewart daughter of Sir Robert Stewart ancestor of the Stewarts of Rosythe and by her had five sons  Sir Robert his heir  Edward progenitor to the Bruces of Airth from whom the Bruces of Earlshall Kinloch Bunzion c  Alexander ancestor of the Bruces of

The Earl of Ailesbury's issue by her were four sons and two daughters His eldest son Robert Lord Bruce born August th died young as did Thomas third son and Henry the youngest His se∣cond son Charles Lord Bruce was called up to the House of Peers in the lifetime of his father as will be hereafter shewn Lady Elizabeth eldest daughter was married to George third Earl of Cardigan and Lady Mary the youngest of whom her mother died in childbed on January th deceased on April d  Which Elizabeth Countess of Ailesbury had a warrant from King Charles II June th granting her the title of Lady and the

youngest daughter of Henry VII as aforesaid from whose eldest Marga∣ret married to James IV King of Scotland the present Royal Family is descended  His Lordship was amongst those Peers who offered their service to King James on the Prince of Orange's embarking his troops for England but on that king's withdrawing from Whitehall on December th in order to embark for France the Lords spiritual and temporal in and about Westminster met at Guildhall the next day and sending for the Lord Mayor drew up a declaration which was signed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York the Earls of Pembroke Dorset and twentyfive other Peers among which the Earl of Ailesbury was the seventeenth that subscribed to it and agreed to the sending to the Prince of Orange The declaration sets forth "That his Majesty having withdrawn himself in order to his departure out of the kingdom by the pernicious counsels of persons ill affected to our nation and religion we cannot without being wanting to our duty be silent under these calamities wherein the Popish councils which so long prevailed have miserably involved these realms We do therefore unanimously resolve to apply ourselves to his Highness the Prince of Orange who with so great kindness to these kingdoms so vast expence and so much hazard to his own person hath under∣taken by endeavouring to procure a free parliament to rescue us with as little effu∣sion as possible of Christian blood from the imminent dangers of popery and slavery  And we do hereby declare the we will with our utmost endeavours assist his Highness in obtaining such a parliament with all speed wherein our laws our liberties and properties may be secured the church of England in particular with a due liberty to protestant dissenters and in general the protestant religion and interest over the whole world may be supported and encouraged to the glory of God the happiness of the established religion and interest in these kingdoms c"  They further declared that they would as much as in them lay preserve the peace of London and Westminster and would disarm all Papists and secure all Jesuits and Romish priests who were in and about the same and if there were any thing more to be performed by them for promoting his Highness's generous inten∣tions for the public good they should be ready to do it as occasion should require  The Earl of Ailesbury acquiesced in those measures as they were apparently the only means of reconciling the King and people and were entirely consonant to the Prince of Orange's declaration wherein he made not the least insinuation of a view to the crown When the King was stopt at Feversham on December th from going over to France on the new thereof the Peers and privycouncil met and after some debates they appointed this Earl of Ailesbury William Paston Earl of Yar∣mouth Lewis Duras Earl of Feversham and Charles Middleton Earl of Middle∣ton to wait on his Majesty to invite his return to his palace at Whitehall to which he shewed some reluctance yet at last condescended to their request Afterwards when the Prince's orders were communicated by three Peers about one in the morn∣ing of December th to the King then in bed for his Majesty to quit his place of Whitehall the Earl of Ailesbury with EdwardHenry Lee Earl of Litchfield James Earl of Arran afterwards Duke of Hamilton and George Douglas Earl of Dunbarton went with the King in his barge who had of the Prince's Dutch forces to guard him to Rochester The same day the Prince came to St James's and the King determining on going to France about three in the morning of Decem∣ber d privately withdrew himself without communicating his design to any of his lords not even the Earl of Dunbarton who lay in his chamber and did not awake till he was gone The Earl of Ailesbury returned to London but never took the oaths to King William and Queen Mary In whilst King William was in Ireland the French after defeating the English fleet under the Earl of Torrington threatened a descent in England and Queen Mary using all precautions to obviate the danger thereof published a proclamation on July th for apprehending EdwardHenry Earl of Litchfield Thomas Earl of Ailesbury William Lord Montgomery son to William Marquis of Powis and divers others suspected to adhere to their Majesties' enemies in the expected invasion However his Lordship was not impri∣soned on that occasion for on January th following King William gave the royal assent to an act to enable Thomas Earl of Ailesbury and Elizabeth Countess of Ailesbury his wife to make provision for payment of debts and to make leases of their estates and in when the Queen on May th another invasion being threatened published a proclamation for apprehending Robert Leak Earl of Scars∣dale the beforementioned Earl of Litchfield and others the Earl of Ailesbury was not among them In the Earl of Ailesbury was said to have been at a meeting  in May at the Old King'shead tavern in Leadenhallstreet London with the Lord Montgomery Sir John Friend Sir John Fenwick Mr Robert Charnock and others when they consulted how to restore King James and all agreed to send a special messenger to desire him to procure of the French King men Bishop Burnet in his History of his own Time recites that after Queen Mary's decease the Jacobites began to think the government had lost the half of its strength and fan∣cied an invasion in the King's absence would be an easy attempt and thereupon sent over to France Charnock a fellow of Magdalen college who in King James's time had turned papist to let them know they would bring a body of horse to meet such an army as should be sent over But Charnock came back with a cold account That nothing could be done at that time Upon which it was thought necessary to send over a man of quality who should press the matter with more authority so the Earl of Ailesbury was prevailed on to go He was admitted to a secret conversation with the French king and this gave rise to a design which was very near being executed the following winter And in when Sir John Friend on March d and Sir William Perkins on the th were tried and suffered for Sir George Barclay's plot on April d following it appeared that in May Charnock had been sent over with a message to King James as beforementioned and that the Earl of Ailes∣bury the Lord Montgomery and Sir John Fenwick were also concerned upon which evidence the Earl of Ailesbury was committed prisoner to the Tower in Fe∣bruary The bishop further observes that Peter Cook son of Sir Miles being brought to his trial on May th was on account of the intended inva∣sion being not charged with the assassination and that his trial was considered as introductory to the Earl of Ailesbury's for the evidence was the same on both George Porter and Cardell Goodman were the two witnesses against him on his meeting with the Earl of Ailesbury and others in Leadenhallstreet All that was brought against their evidence was says the bishop the master of the tavern and two of his servants swearing that they remembered well the company which was at the tavern for they were often coming into the room where they sat both at dinner time and after it and they saw not Goodman there nay they were positive he was not there On the other hand Porter deposed that Goodman was not with them at dinner but came after and sent him a note upon which he with the consent of the company went out and brought him in The jury considered that the servants of  the house were not in constant attendance nor could they be believed in a negative against positive evidence to the contrary and it might be well supposed that for the interest of their house they might be induced to make stretches and thereupon Cook was found guilty and condemned He obtained many short reprieves upon assurances he would tell all he knew but as he did not deal sincerely his punishment ended in banishment Sir John Fenwick was next brought to his trial but Good∣man having been persuaded to go out of England there were not then two witnesses against him so by course of law he must have been acquitted and also on that ac∣count the Earl of Ailesbury never came to his trial But Sir John Fenwick had confessed in hopes of pardon before the lords justices being on oath that the Earl of Ailesbury having been admitted to a private audience of the French king pro∣posed his sending over an army of men and had undertaken that a great body of gentlemen and horses should be brought to join them yet at the same time as observed by bishop Burnet took care to name none of his own side except those against whom evidence was already brought as in the case of the Earl of Ailesbury or who were safe and beyond sea and King William not being satisfied therewith Sir John was attainted by parliament and suffered death on January th The Countess of Ailesbury his wife was so afflicted at his Lordship's confinement in the Tower that she died in childbed on January th but the Earl her husband was admitted to bail on February th following His Lordship after∣wards having obtained King William's leave to reside at Brussels he there married secondly Charlotte Countess of Sannu of the ancient and noble house of Argenteau in the dutchy of Brabant and by her who died at Brussels on July d N S in the st year of her age had an only
