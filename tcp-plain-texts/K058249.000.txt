her at she lies asleep and cut her head off you'll do a deed our king will pay you for  MAC  Come along my dear and you shall only shew me her body and let me alone to find her head out myself but I can't help laughing to think if I cut off this old witch's head when she's asleep how foolish she'll look in the morning without it when she wakes and misses her head she'll be down in the mouth for you know child if you was to lose your own head it must put you out of countenance  Exeunt  together  Enter Black Lady and Princess  BLACK WOMAN  I hope my princess will not think me rude but while our warriors are executing their enterprize I flatter my∣self I have discovered something will amuse you The sailors have left behind them a wild man who has pro∣fessed himself my lover I have persuaded him there's an old witch in a cave hard by and if he can cut off her head he is to have me and a large plantation for this pains With your highness's leave I'll hide in the cave the large pasteboard image you have made and af∣ter he has in the dark cut off the head I can make him believe she will haunt him for it  LADY  Pray let me see this man and while I examine him you may prepare the image  Exit  Black Woman  Enter  Mac  bowing very low  LADY  Who are you sir  MAC  Any body at your service madam  LADY  From whence came you sir  MAC  From a little potatoe estate in the Queen's county where all the rest of us lives and by my shoul my father would be glad to see you there for he has been blind these ten years  LADY  Have you a house there  MAC  Faith have I and as pretty a house as ever you set your loving eyes upon tho' there was a little accident hap∣pened to the top of it for it set itself on fire and I run away by the light of it but I have got the key of the  street door in my pocket and that is some satisfaction you know  LADY  How came you to take a fancy to the sea sir  MAC  I never did faith but it took such a fancy to me yesterday that I thought it would never let me get out of it  LADY  How came you then to go to sea  MAC  Why I had a mind to make my fortune among the islands upon the continent for I had read all the history books of antipathy so I vowed to be doing something as well as paddy Julius Caesar did so I agreed with one captain Bowwo to carry me over sea with him but I told him I would not stand to any damages for if the ship sunk in the middle of the sea before we got half over he must get another to carry me in or the Devil a rap I would give him for my passage  LADY  Well sir pray go on  MAC  So then I stepped head foremost into the ship but when they set it a running oh I thought I should die every minute and I got drunk with the smell of the sea water I called out to them to stop the ship but the Devil a word would they hear on their ears about it so at last we could see no land but what was quite out of sight so I clapped my back against the great big stick that grew out of the middle of the floor of the ship to look about me but then the clouds turned black in the face the waves in the water began to grow big belly'd and the Captain swore and the sail∣ors cry'd a lake a lake but the Devil a lake or onion either could I see then they bothered about and said Run the ship ashore Run the ship ashore but I want∣ed to run myself ashore and not the ship and so I  told the Captain for I would be going upon dry land I said tho' I was up to my neck in the mud  Enter  Black Woman  BLACK WOMAN  It is time the witch is asleep  LADY  Good luck go with you sir  MAC  As to that my jewel whether good luck goes with me or is after following me never heed that but madam I hope you'll be after putting yourself in mind after I have cut off this old witch's head that this lady shall be man and wife to me no I don't mean so nei∣ther that I shall be man and wife to this lady Devil burn me that's not it neither I mean that as we are one flesh so when the parson joins us we shall be two together  Ex  Lady  one way and  Mac  and  Black Woman  another  SCENE V  A Cave  Enter  Black Woman  and  Mac  BLACK WOMAN  Now draw your sword she lies with her head to∣wards us but be sure you don't wake her  MAC  Not till I have cut her head off my dear and then if she wakes what matters it  BLACK WOMAN  You must creep upon your hands and knees  MAC  Then I should have something to put under my feet you know my dear for fear I should make a noise  BLACK WOMAN  In in in  The  Irishman  creeps in upon his hands and knees A shout behind the Scenes  Enter a  Messenger  MESSENGER  Our princess wants you and our monarch has order∣ed rewards to the English sailors  Exit  Messen  Reenter  Mac  with the woman's head  MAC  Arrah faith honey and here's her skull sure enough she was devilish light headed upon my shoul for it is not so heavy as a good potatoe  BLACK WOMAN  Now sir come with me  MAC  Stay my jewel let us shut up the door of the cave with a great big stone for fear the old witch should have a mind to come out for her head again  BLACK WOMAN  Do you think she can walk without her head  MAC  Why there's nothing at all in that there was St Patrick's horse once lost his head at the battle of Clogher and he galloped nine miles without it and never would have miss'd it only as he crossed a river he stooped down to drink so then he found he had lost it  Enter the  Image  IMAGE  Give me my head my head  MAC  Devil burn me if I do so do not bother me be easy can't you for if you'll believe me you become the loss of your head as well as any woman in all Ireland  IMAGE  Give me my head

makes  MAC  Ah and by my shoul I'll be after showing this head to the King so hear you mrs witch by my shoul I don't know which to speak to the head or the body here one of you answer me but if you can't why tell me so Stay here a little just while I lose myself and then if you find me I'll give you your own head for nothing and mine at the same price  IMAGE  Give me my head  Exit  Mac Black Woman Image  follows them  SCENE VI  A shout behind the Scenes Enter two sailors with a large bundle  BEN  Avast Ned let's overhaul our plunder  They open the bundle and pull out two large muffs and bag wigs and a powder engine two old fashioned laced shirts with ruffles sewed into the sleeves They powder and dress themselves and put the muffs upon their legs and then compliment one another  Enter  Mac  pursued by the  Image  the sailors seize the  Image  NED  Hollo what's this thing without a head  BEN  It looks like the sign of the good woman  IMAGE  Give me my head  NED  Where does her voice come from  MAC  Why out of her stomach you fool you because she has been forc'd to eat her words lately  BEN  If I had her for a wife now wou'd our children have any brains  MAC  There's nothing in that my jewel for my father bought a cropt mare to breed horses without ears but it wou'd not do  NED  Let's carry her to the captain  MAC  Ah and take me along with you because you know as I carry her head in my fist I can put in a word for her as she can't speak for herself  SCENE VII  The Court discovered  Enter  Indian  king capain lady and attendants the king joins the captain's hands and his daughter's  KING  Thus may America and England join  And Britain with her younger sister twine  Britannia's sailors will defend our shores  And in return we'll ope our Indian stores  Our planters o'er their vast savannahs smile  Well pleas'd they labour for fair England's weal  Each sun scorch'd Indian for Great Britain sings  And down the Ohio banks the glorious chorus rings  A shout behind  IMAGE  Give me my head  Enter the Irishman with the head the image and two sailers following  CAPTAIN  How now what's all this  MAC  Arrah never seem to mind it my jewel it is nothing at all not that neither only this old witch wants her head again and I want to sell it and faith if every body that wanted a head would be after coming to me by my shoul I should have three halves of the world for my customers  BEN  May it please your honourableship's nobleness our crew has no mind to come into the dock of matrimony and for my part I don't care to sail any longer without a consort so if you please I should like this gentle∣woman to stow under my hatches  MAC  By my shoul but she was after being promis'd to me  BLACK WOMAN  No sir you are better provided for for since you have got that lady's head it can be no harm to you to take the rest of her body  MAC  But I'll live single first all the days of my life and a day afterwards so my jewel I beg you'll speak to the king for to make me a gentleman of horse or a maid of honour in the same troop  CAPTAIN  Now my lads let's all rejoice  And for our king and country raise our voice  Let envy feeding discontented elves  Who fancy all men blockheads but themselves  Rail right or wrong dispute deny debate  And if they miss their pension damn the state  Then praise the French French diet let them chuse  Soup meagre frogs sour wine and wooden shoes  Such abject minds bend to the tyrant's scourge  But let us boldly say God bless King George  FINIS
