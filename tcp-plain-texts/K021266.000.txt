THE MIRROR OR HARLEQUIN EVERY WHERE  PART I  SCENE I  A view of  Tartarus  as described in the  Pantheon  Chorus of Infernals  Let sighs and groans  And heavy moans  Oh winds be hurl'd  To t'other world  'Till mortals hear  Trembling for fear  They should be howling  Grunting growling  Burning  Turning  Toasting  Roasting  In this infernal world as we are    During the chorus  Harlequin  is dragged on by  Belphegor  Har  Oh what an infernal diabolical concert is here And pray good Mr Devil having lugged me through the sea like a drowning rat precipitated me like a bullet out of a culverin from the Antipodes to the borders of Acheron to dry me flown with me over the Styx and introduced me to his infernal majesty in the coppercoloured jacket what's to be done next  RECITATIVE  Bel  You must be plung'd Sir in this gulph here  Of bitumen and boiling sulphur  Har  The devil I must what like a potatoe in a tar kettle I suppose And pray what have I done to merit so much honour  RECITATIVE  Bel  You broke which was not very civil  Your sworn allegiance to the devil  Har  Why to be sure I did make a sort of a foolish promise that if his diabolical highness would suffer me to leap and skip about turn men into jack asses and rocks and trees into dancing devils I would finish my career by paying a visit to his gloomy majesty's hellish dominions but I did not expect to be sent for so soon nor to be treated with so elegant an entertainment when I arrived  RECITATIVE  Bel  Peace and be with your lot contented  Whilst to these gents you are presented  Who here so pamper'd and so flush are  By Belphegor Hell's Gem'men Usher  Har  A very courteous introduction upon my word and pray who compose this happy assembly among whom I am to have the felicity of sitting as a member That gemman and his vulture for instance  AIR  Bel  That gentleman whom there you see  The vulture gnawing his liver  A very wicked wight was he  A Judge and great lawgiver  More orphans goods than tongue can tell  On earth devour'd this limb  And now for punishment in hell  A vulture devours him  Har  A good pleasant situation why if it was not for your tail and your hoofs I should take you for the man describing the tombs in Westminster Abby what the old ones have been all relieved I suppose at a limitted time  Bel  nods    Ah I understand you I wish I was fairly out of your clutches and pray who have we on that wheel in the place of Ixion  II  Bel  That figure on the wheel you see  I'd have you to understand  A noted minister was he  And Lord of a certain land  The nation who did cheat and trouble  And roast to gain his pelf  And who at last made his own bubble  In roasting here himself  Har  A judicious punishment enough but I suppose sometimes attended with inconvenience for if you roast all who cheat their nation you must very often be damnably put to it for spits Now for those in the place of Sysiphus and Tantalus a pleasant amusement that of rolling a stone up a hill and never reaching the top of it or the other gentleman's entertainment of having so many delicacies close to his hand without being able to touch one of them  III  Bel  He who the Chemist's stone pursu'd  Which makes such rout and pother  Here rolls a stone which doth elude  His search as did the other  T'other who cash of Charities  Did gormandize and suttle  On dainties feasts but with his eyes  The punishment is suttle  Har  It is indeedwho but the devil could invent a punishment for an Alderman equal to setting him to a delicious dinner and conveying every thing away before he had time to put the napkin under his chin Now for a description of the ladies at that labourinvain amusement of emptying a well with sieves and the gentleman under that tremendous rock and I have done  IV  Bel  Those harmless ladies o'er their tea  With scandal time did kill  That well must empty as you see  In sieves that never fill  That miser who the heart had ne'er  To lay his illgot gains out  Now shrinking trembling quakes for fear  That rock should knock his brains out  Har  Another amusement in your stile  RECITATIVE  Bel  And so Sir in politest fashion  Having describ'd hell's recreation  To know your choice I must request Sir  Is't boil'd or roasted you like best Sir  Hor  Boiled or roasted I'cod I like either when the meat's tender  RECITATIVE  Bel  You have not Sir my meaning hit  Here here Tisiphone bring a spit  Har  Nay now but zounds you would not be so damn'd unmerciful would ye Ah  Astorath  comes on    RECITATIVE  Ast  Hold Belphegor Pluto ordains  Hell shall today throw'off her chains  For Proserpine arriv'd here is  From visiting her mother Ceres  Frolick then devils sport and play  And celebrate hell's holiday  Ast  My dear friend how much I am obliged to you if you had not come as you did Oh I should have been skewer'd upon that damn'd spit like a trussed rabbit    Whilst the infernals sing and form a dance Harlequin retires and seems thoughtful towards the end be appears to have hit on something that pleases him    Har  How devilish merry you are all of you you forget that your torments are tomorrow to begin again Oh that infernal spit I shall never be able to bear the fight of roast meat again but come 'tis no time to talk we are unchained and unguarded and let us seize this favourable opportunity to make our escape  RECITATIVE  Tor Spir  But how At the door is plac'd as curb o'er us  A curst threeheaded dogone Cerberus  Fair mercy's torch in blood who slakes  To fatten his pestiferous snakes  Har  Oh Lord I am no stranger to the tremendous race of Cerberus we have a tolerable number of them upon earth yet I never heard but that the greatest snarler of them all might be occasionally quieted with a sop the question therefore is will you follow me and escape or stay here and be roasted  CHORUS  Follow we're by justice spurr'd  Courage and liberty's the word  Of mirth and pastime be profuse  The

joyful occasion Proserpine has invited me to an elegant fetechampetre in Elysium and she'll be angry to the last degree if I should exceed my appointment so d'ye hear all the rest may have leave to go back again to earth guilty or not guilty    The spirits go off and the infernals who have broke out of  Tartarus  come on singing the Chorus with  Harlequin  in triumph on their shoulders when they all pass the stage the scene changes    SCENE  The entrance into hell A view of the Styx and the opposite shore  c  AIR  Cer  Though rude my form though I'm unbred  Yet I am pamper'd high and fed  On

his head after which he drives the others back again and follows them  Harlequin  finding himself escaped is running off when he sees  Punch  who comes on hearing the noise and who was waiting for

are about  Pun  Terira tira wira dira  st Ant  Dinina hera in hira cleara  Pun  They're some great persons of their nation  Here dining on a cold collation  Har  I am mighty curious to know something of their customs and manners but they are such a devilish way off there's hardly any hearing them and if we go headforemost among them we shall make a develish clatter among their bottles and glasses and in the mean time let us have some conversation with them Ask that gentleman in black who he is  Pun  Quisitivimo  d Ant  Skipalurny  Pun  His name is Probity an attorney  Har  You must certainly

heard the name of cuckold  Har  Lord Lord what a monster such a kind of animal would appear in our upper regions But there's one thing I admire prodigiously with two words they express a whole sentence but I suppose as they differ from us in every thing else so they do in that particular and as we often say a great deal without expressing any thing so every thing they say or do is to the purpose If one could but import this secret what a wonderful deal of unnecessary haranguing it would save in some certain assemblies Well I long to be among them But how the devil shall we get there for I can't walk upon my hands    They get behind a cloud and are taken up    SCENE  A rural prospect in the midst of Winter  Harlequin Punch  c c  Har  Oh Punch how devilish cold it is The isicles hang on the trees like so many ropes of onions and the ground is as hoary as an old hermit I would fain try this same glass but 'tis such perishing weather the females can't venture out but I am

SCENE  Each object becomes as in the midst of summer  Har  Ah ha this is something like now my litmirror will go to work I see that zounds here they come in all their finery summer alone can produce

I've seen her jeering  Coquetting ogling leering  In absence of papa  In pleasure sweet confounded  Oh how my heart has bounded  Thump a thump a thump  To be wise as my mama  II  Or when the captain's

Har  What's this Punch a statue Zounds suppose by way of a frolick we try the glass for I am afraid we shall never get any thing flesh and blood to answer our purpose Pray my pretty dear little delicate creature are you sixteen years old and a maid in thought word and deed    Col nods graciously    Hey what the devil's this the words I have uttered are certainly some charm that cunning old thief Pluto has put in my mouth to animate this statue Give me the glass in a minute Punch for fear having imbibed a few particles of amorous air she would have fallen in love with one of us    He holds the glass to Col she breathes on it    Victoria Victoria  'tis as pure is ever My sweet creature give me your hand    she jumps down    But Punch oh oh oh    chuckling    'tis a pity such a tid

my fields yellow over with corn  '  I seldom have found any tares  '  Of such use are my harrow and plough  '  In my orchards grow apples and pears  '  In my dairy there's milk from the cow  II  '  Not an oak in my grove is there seen  '  But an ivy around it does creep  '  Not a yew tree's more rev'ren'd green  '  Whence a rev'ren'd owl does not peep  '  Not a blossom have I or a bud  '  But in

stroke  '  How sheep ducks and geese cocks and hens  '  Cackling love parade dunghills that smoke  '  Other farms may perhaps be more clean  '  Outhouses and hovels more fine  '  Other owners more courtly be seen  '  But their profit's not equal to mine  RECITATIVE  Ceres  Hey why and wherefore is this clatter  Speak what the devil is the matter  Why driv'ler dolt clown fool clodpated  How came

Madam coming into your garden where I have been looking in every crick and corner to find you chance directed me to this statue and so by way of a little foolery talking to it as if it was alive crack in a moment down it jumped as lissom I warrant you as you or I  RECITATIVE  Ceres  The charm is broke thenOh the villain  I'd strangle him had he lives a million  It was foretold at feasts estival  This girl should be my daughter's rival  I therefore fix'd her here an image  And to th' oracle made pilgrimage  It answered  "  She shall be your charge in  "  Till one shall ask if she's a virgin  "

  d T  No Prithee run to a grenade as it comes piping hot out of a mortarpiece and say you take the law of it    st T  Neighbour I can but think what lanes a chain shot would make in the law and how like an ass a judge would look with his head shot off  Irish  Why to be sure to have one's head shot off would put any man out of countenance    st T  Madam Ceres has done very kindly by us indeed to place us in a town where we are besieged by the devil    d T  What shall we do    st T  Let us to her temple and beg of her to compound for such limbs as we want most in our callings Let me see thou
