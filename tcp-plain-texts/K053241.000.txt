English grammars hitherto published being so complex and the whole matter made such a study that the  desideratum  sought for is not to be acquired without the assistance of a master and the application of years The design of this Abstract is to teach a person acquainted with English how to speak and write correctly without entering into all the  minutiae  of Grammar which serve only to perplex and confound The Author aims not at teaching his pupil what words are  particles what prepositions and so on but merely to avoid false concords and incorrect language and he flatters himself the few following pages will answer all the purposes better than more complete or regular systems He has also added some few rules for read∣ing which if attended to must lead to reading well  ABSTRACT OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR  Of the denomination of Words  THE only words necessary to be known gram∣matically are  Nouns Pronouns Adjectives Verbs Adverbs  and  Participles  A  Noun  is the name of a thing as  Horse Boat Knife  c  A  Pronoun  is a substitute for a Noun as  I he she  c  An  Adjective  expresses the quality of a Noun as a  sound Horse  an  open Boat  a  sharp Knife  here  sound open  and  sharp  are Verbs  A  Verb  implies the action of the Noun and an  Adverb  the action of the Verb as the horse  gallops  the boat  sails  the knife  cuts  Here  galloping  is the action of the horse  sailing  the action of the boat and  cutting  the action of the knife of course  gallops sails  and  cuts  are Verbs  An Adverb expresses the action of the Verb Thus the horse gallops  quick  the boat sails  briskly  the knife cuts  badly  Here  quick  expresses the action of  galloping briskly  that of sailing and  badly  that of  cutting  of course  quick briskly  and  badly  are Adverbs that is addition to Verbs  A Participle partakes of the qualities of both Noun and Verb and implies acting or being acted on  These are the different parts of speech I would wish my pupil to be acquainted with I will treat of them in their order  Of  NOUNS  Nouns Substantives are the  general  names o  things except proper names which are  particular  ones A horse for example is a  general  name it may be  my  horse or  yours  so is a boat a knife c but proper names are  particular  ones as  Thomas  the name of a man  Jolly  the name of a horse c  Horse boat knife  c then are Nouns  Nouns have two numbers the  singular  and the  plural  The singular number expresses  an individual  as a  horse  a  boat  a  knife  the plural expresses many as  horses boats knives  c  In other languages Nouns have a variety of  cases  that is vary in their terminations but in English there are but two these correspond with the  geni∣tive  and  accusative  Thus instead of the head  of a horse  we say  a horse's head  not  horses  which is the plural number of horse but  horse's  which we call the genitive case singular so  boat's knife's  as the  boat's  side the  knife's  edge  Plurals ending in  s  have no genitive cases we write  womens  not  women's mens  not  men's  and so on  No Nouns have accusative cases but Pronouns these vary their terminations when they follow or are acted upon by verbs  I  preceding a verb is changed to  me  when fol∣lowing one  We  to  us  Thou  to  thee  or  you  Ye  to  you  He  to  him  She  to  her  They  to  them  Who  to  whom  Thus we say "  I  love you"  I  here  precedes  the verb  love  but  I  could not  follow  the same verb with propriety it would be rendered  me  We should not say "You love  I  " but "you love  me  " So again "  Thou  lovest me" "I love  thee" Thou  before the verb  thee  after it "  We  love God" "God loves  us  " and so on  The words  who  and  whom  require a little further explanation We say "Kings are personages  whom  we revere" Here though in the present mode of speech  whom  precedes the verb  revere  it is nevertheless used in the accusative case being the word which the verb  revere  governs and acts upon answering to  them  when we say "we revere them" So in the following example "William was the person  who  came to me" Here the pro∣noun  who  precedes the verb  came  and governs it "William was the person to  whom  I spoke" Here  whom  though it precedes or is placed before the verb  spoke  to render it more agreeable to the ear is governed or acted on by it  English Nouns are then thus declined none hav∣ing accusative cases but the Pronouns  Sing  Horse  Gen  Horse's  Plur  Horses  Sing  Boat  Gen  Boat's  Plur  Boats  Note  The genitive case implies  of  or  belonging to  The word  whose  is sometimes used as the geni∣tive of  which  and chiefly in poetry  "The fruit  "Of that forbidden tree  whose  mortal taste  "Brought death into the world"  MILTON  But  of which  is now most common "The mat¦ters  of which  I spoke" Though  whose  may be used with propriety when it refers to persons as "This is the young woman  whose  worth I know"  The genitive of the other Pronouns are as fol∣low  I  Gen  mine or my  Thou  Gen  thine or thy  He  Gen  his  She  Gen  hers  we  Gen  ours or our  ye  Gen  yours or your  they  Gen  theirs or their  It  Gen  its  Mine thine ours yours  or  theirs  may be used without a noun annexed but  my thy our your their  never Thus "Whose book is this" The answer may be  mine  or  thine  or  ours  or  yours  or  theirs  alone but if we use  my thy our your  or  their  we must add the noun book to it a say  my book thy book our book your book  or  their book  When the word  own  is added to the pronouns  my thy his hers our your  or  their  it is to render the expression more emphatical as "I live in my  own  house" "I did it with my  own  hand" c  The plural number is formed by adding  s  at the end of the singular number as in the following  Sing  Plur  Sing  Plur  House  Houses  Table  Tables  Walk  Walks  Sister  Sisters  Stool  Stools  Outrage  Outrages c  Lance  Lances  But there are some exceptions to this general rule as the following irregular plurals will shew  Sing  Plur  Sing  Plur  Loaf  Loaves  Foot  Feet  Calf  Calves  Church  Churches  Shelf  Shelves  Fish  Fishes  Half  Halves  Box  Boxes  Self  Selves  Ox  Oxen  Sheaf  Sheaves  Man  Men  Thief  Thieves  Sow  Swine  Wife  Wives  Child  Children  Wolf  Wolves  Brother  Brethren  Knife  Knives  Woman  Women  Louse  Lice  Penny  Pence  Mouse  Mice  Body  Bodies  Die  Dice  Mercy  Mercies  Goose  Geese  Enemy  Enemies  Tooth  Teeth  Witness  Witnesses c  and  This  These  That  Those  The singular and plural of some few words are the same as  sheep deer fern hose  in which case the singular number is pointed out by  a  going be∣fore them as  a sheep a deer  Some words also have no singular number as  annals arms ashes bellows breeches cresses en∣trails ides lungs means nones scissars sheers snuf∣fers thanks tongs wages dregs news  c  Proper names of men cities rivers countries c have no plurals This rule however is not without some exceptions We say "There were ten  Williams  in company" And when speaking of families we say the  Marlboroughs  the  Cavendishes  the  Howards  c  I can at no better time mention the proper use of the pronouns  who which  and  what  as interro∣gatives or not  Who  is used only when speaking of persons as "  Who  is that man or that woman"  Which  when we speak of things as "  Which  is your cane  What  when we are speaking of the kind quality or order of persons or things as "  What  lady is that" "  What  house is this" "  What  or which place do you chuse"  When  who  and  which  are not interrogatives that is do not ask a question they are used with the same distinction that is  who  for persons and  which  for things We say "William was the person  who  came to me" "This is the horse  which  I bought"  Now we are upon the subject of nouns it is pro∣per to say something of gender  There are three genders the  male female  and  neuter  The  male  and  female  distinguish the two sexes whereas the  neuter  is applied to things without life as not properly belonging to either of the other as table st  ne rock c  When we speak of the  male  gender we use the pronoun  he  when of the  female  gender  she  when of the  neuter it  Thus  The bridegroom  he  came from the barn  The bride  she  came in from the field  The table  it  fell on the floor  We indeed deem most things that contain any thing within them to be of the female gender as the  earth  a  ship  a  house  c and in poetry where writers will frequently give slight to their fancy and personify inanimate substances they are deemed o the male or female gender according to the idea of the Poet Thus  Death Time  the  Sun  c are generally of the male gender  Faith Hope Cha∣rity  c of the female as being of the softer virtues  But our language in many instances save us the necessity of adding pronouns to express genders for we often distinguish the different sexes by di∣stinct words as for example  Male  Female  Male  Female  Father  Mother  Sloven  Slut  Husband  Wife  Man  Woman  Brother  Sister  Rake  Jilt  Uncle  Aunt  Boar  Sow  Widower  Widow  Buck  Doe  Master  Mistress  Cock  Hen  Nephew  Niece  Dog  Bitch  Wizzard  Witch  Drake  Duck  Bachelor  Maid  or  Vir∣gin  Gander  Goose     Horse  Mare  Bridegroom  Bride  Ram  Ewe  Whoremonger  Whore  or  Strumpet  Steer  Heifer     Boy  Girl  Bull  Cow  King  Queen  Lad  Lass  Lord  Lady  Duke  Duchess  Milter  Spawner  c  There are also some few words which distin∣guish the female sex from the male by the ending  Male  Female  Male  Female  Abbot  Abbess  Shepherd  Shepherdess  Actor  Actress  Executor  Executrix  Baron  Baroness  Adminis∣trator  Aministra∣trix  Heir  Heiress  Prior  Prioress  c  Lion  Lioness  Where there are no words to distinguish the sexes we frequently add one to answer the pur∣pose Thus we say a  malechild  a  femalechild  a  hegoat  a  shegoat  a  man servant  a  maidservant  a  cocksparrow  a  hensparrow  or the like  Of  ADJECTIVES  Adjectives are words which cannot stand alone but are added to nouns to express their quality as  black white wise foolish round square  c Thus we say a  black dog  a  wise  man a  round table  There are three degrees of Adjectives called  degrees of Comparison  the  positive comparative  and  superlative  The  positive  degree is the quality itself simply as  black white wise  c  The  comparative  expresses more of any one thing than another and is formed by adding  er  to t  e positive as  blacker whiter wiser  sometimes in∣stead of saying  blacker  we say  more black  for  white more white  for  wiser more wise  c  The  superlative  degree implies the highest and is formed  y the termination  es    or the  most  before the positive Thus  blackest  black whitest  or  most white wisest  or  mo  Some superlatives are formed by adding  most  as a termination thus  nether  outer outermost under undermost upper upper∣most in inner innermost  c  Many Adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations but are only compared by  more  and  most  as  benevolent more benevolent most benevolent  Some authors have used  shadiest virtuousest famousest mortalest naturallest powerfullest inventivest trifling∣est  c but these are liberties which every one cannot take and are inelegant after all  Some again are irregularly compared as  Positive  Compar  Superl  Good  Better  Best  Bad  Worse  Worst  Little  Less  Least  Near  Nearer  Nearest  Much  More  Most  Late  Later  Last  Indeed the comparison of Adjectives is very un∣certain and being much regulated by the ear or agreeableness of sounds cannot well be reduced to rules  When a noun is substituted for an adjective and added to another noun by hyphen such two words are called compound words as  TurkeyLeather Mountainwine manservant seafish  c  Of  VERBS  Verbs as I observed express the action of Nouns  A Verb is said to have several  moods  and  tenses  We shall have occasion only to name the Infinitive mood which is known by the word  to  preceding it as  to love to hate  c and two of the  Tenses  the  present  and the  past  these two are expressed  by terminations the other tenses are expressed  the auxiliary verbs  shall will  and  have  precedin  them of course it is not necessary to mention ther  as we have nothing to do but with the right use words  themselves  The  present  time or tense is expressed by the ve  itself as  burn love hate  the  past  time by the ter∣mination  ed  as  burned loved hated  A Verb has also three  persons  st d and  and like Nouns two  numbers  singular and plur    The three persons in the singular of verbs are  thou  and  he  or  she  in the plural  We ye  a  they  Thus  Persons  Present tense singular    I love    Thou lovest    He  or  she loveth  or  love  Plural    We love    Ye love    They love  Past time singular    I loved    Thou lovedst    He  or  she loved  Plural    We loved    Ye loved    They loved  Infinitive mood  To love  Participle present  Loving  past  Loved  There are two sorts of verbs  active  and  passive  love  is a verb  active to be loved  a verb  passive  still according to my first definition of a verb  love  or  be loved  implies the action of the person  ving  The passive verb is formed by the addition of the  xiliary or assisting verb  to be  Thus in the pre∣  nt tense or time  Sing  I  am  thou  art  he  or  she  is  Plur  We  are  or  be  ye  are  or  be  they  are  or  be  Past tense  or  time  Sing  I  was  thou  wast  or  was  he  or  she  was  Plur  We  were  ye  were  they  were  Participle present  Being  past  Having been  Infinitive mood  To be  Now by adding the word  love  to each it will  thus  I am loved  Thou wast loved  He was loved  c  And so through the whole  The other auxiliary verbs are  have shall will  may can Have  being the principal we will  through the tenses of this  Present tense  or  time  Sing  I  have  thou  hast  he  or  she  hath  or  has  Plur  We  have  ye  have  they  have  Past tense  Sing  I  had  thou  hadst  he  or  she  had  Plur  We  had  ye  had  they  had  Participle present  Having  past  Had  Infinitive mood  To have  There is still another form of English ver  in which the sign of the Infinitive mood  to  added to the verb  do  which it is necessary to learn  Present tense  Sing  I  do  thou  dost  he  or  she  doth  Plur  We  do  ye  do  they  do  Past tense  Sing  I  did  thou  didst  he  or  she  did  Plur  We  did  ye  did  they  did  In the subsequent tenses  did  is changed to  do  I have  done  I had  done  c  Infinitive mood  To do  or  to have done  Participle present  Doing  past  Done  By rapid utterance or poetical contraction  love  is often used for  loved snatch'd  for  snatch  dwelt  for  dwelled smelt  for  smelled  and so on  But not to multiply rules and burthen the learn∣er's memory with terms the following list of regular Verbs in their present and past tenses w  be sufficient to instruct These he should well  ¦member  Present time  Past  Participle  Awake  awoke  awoke  Abide  abode  abode  Be  been  being been  Bend  bent  bent  Bear  bore bare  borne  Begin

Sleep  slept  slept  Sling  slang  slung  Smell  smelt  smelt  Smite  smote  smitten  Speak  spoke  spoken  Spell  spelled spelt  spelt  Spill  spilled spilt  spilt  Spend  spent  spent  Spin  span  spun  Spit  spat  spun  Spring  sprang  sprung  Stand  stood  stood  Stick  stuck  stuck  Sting  stung  stung  Steal  stole  stolen  Stink  stank  stunk  Present time  Past  Participle  Strike  struck  stricken  Strive  strove  striven  Swear  swore  sworn  Sweep  sweeped swept  swept  Swell  swelled  swoln  Swing  swang swung  swung  Swim  swam swum  swum  Take  took  took taken  Tear  tore  torn  Teach  taught  taught  Tell  told  told  Think  thought  thought  Thrive  throve  thriven  Throw  threw  thrown  Tread  trod  trodden  Weep  wept  wept  Win  won  won  Wind  wound  wound  Wear  wore  worn  Weave  wove  woven  Write  wrote writ  written writ  Work  worked wrought  wrought  Wring  wrung  wrung  These rules premised the great art in writing and speaking correctly is to avoid false concords that is the singular number must never be coupled with the plural c Also  The noun or pronoun and the verb following it must be of the same number and person We must not say  I were I  being the first person  were  the second but  I am  both in the first person nei∣ther should we say  thou were thou  being singular and  were  plural but  thou wert  both singular  We must take care to use the proper word to express the right time whether it be present or past In the irregular verbs the foregoing list will point out the word in the regular ones the termination  ed  will always express the past time Thus for example we must not say "he  breaked  the bowl" but  broke  it not "he  come  home" but  came  In the use of the words  this  and  that  which in the plural number are  these  and  those  we must take care that they agree with the number of he word they refer to We must not say  this men  or  that men  the one being singular the other plural but  this  or  that man these  or  those men  But where a noun has no singular number we may add  this  or  that  to the plural of such words thus we may say with propriety "by  this  or  that means  " So nouns wanting a singular number are sometimes joined to a verb singular but inelegantly as "the news  is  sta  e" "your wages  is  small"  Two or more names or things in the singular number require the verb to be in the plural Thus "William and John  are  not  is  good lads" "The sun and wind  overcame  not  overcome  me"  Names of a multitude may have either a sin∣gular or a plural verb Thus we may say "The Parliament  is  or  are  sitting"  When two or more nouns of different num∣bers follow each other with the word  or  or  nor  be∣tween them and are equally related to a common verb the verb should agree with the noun next it For example "Either the husband the wife  or  their children  are  in the house" "Neither the husband the children  nor  the wife  is  in the house"  Two negatives make an affirmative "I wasn't good for nothing" implies "It was good so something" "I can't eat no more" means "can eat more"  The participle present is frequently substituted for the In  initive mood of a verb and with ele∣gance Thus instead of "I like to work" we may say "I like working" "For he delights to walk we may say "He delights in walking"  After the auxiliary verb  have  it would be improper to put the past time the participle should always follow Thus it would be ingrammatica  to say "I have  saw  or "I have  wrote  " it should be "I have  seen  " or "I have  written  "  When the leading adverbs are  whether  o  either or  must follow in the same sentence where the leading adverb is  neither nor  must follow Thus "Whether you  or  I shall go is not yet de∣termined" "Either your  or  I must ride" "Nei∣ther you  nor  I must speak"  All repetitions of the same word nay of words which express the same thing are carefully to  voided except when the sense would be otherwise obscure or when it is to excite the atten∣tion For example a repetition of the word  from  in the following sentence is allowable the passage would not be clear without it "It proceeds not  from  stupidity or a slothful neglect but  from  a generous liberality of soul When it is to excite attention a repetition is beautiful "Every acti∣on nay  every  attention  every  design of man is known to the Almighty"  With respect to Adjectives none should be used but such as are  necessary  to explain the subject more fully To say  burning  or  shining  fire is in∣elegant  because the first idea of fire is that it burns and shines but if necessary we may employ adjectives to express its other qualities as  consum∣ing sparkling brisk  c  In short the words of a sentence ought generally to be as different from one another both in sense and sound as the nature of the subject and the har∣mony of the period will admit On this the beauty of a sentence depends the sound being as it were an echo to the sense and independent of this on the smoothness of the words the choice of adjec∣tives and the easy flow of its diction And in general the shorter the period the more nervous and emphatical it is  An  OBSERVATION  or two on  WRITING  and  READING  In writing never use capital letters to begin a word unless it be a proper name or at the begin∣ning of a sentence  Note  A full stop or note of admiration or interrogation always ends a sentence  If you quote an Author in his own words always begin the quotation with a capital letter  The word  I  or  Oh  should be always written with a capital Every word you wish to mark as em∣phatic should begin with a capital and have a line drawn under it thus Mark  In order to read well  Every one should read in an easy familiar tone as if he were speaking expect it be a prayer  in which case a degree of solemnity is required and should adapt his voice to the subjectmatter he is reading  When reading cast your eye forwards to the words following that you may have seen them before you are to pronounce them This will prevent stammering or a disagreeable pause  Attend to the stops and pause at a comma whilst you can count  one  at a semicolon  two  at a colon  three  and at a full stop  four  Notes of interrogation and admiration are full stops A line thus intimates a longer pause than that of full stop and at every fresh paragraph we are to pause longer still  Never fetch or draw the breath where there is no stop nor pass a stop without a pause Pause proportionably at every stop utter each word di∣stinctly sound the last letter of every word read slow and you will read very intelligibly  In reading a sentence the voice should be gently raised until you get to the middle and the middle of a sentence is generally marked with a colon and then should gradually fall to the end of it but take care that at the end of a sentence you drop not the voice too low so as not to be well heard to the last word  In questions and passages of admiration the voice should not fall as at a full stop but be kept up higher and higher to the end  To give spirit and energy to a sentence the leading or principal word should be pronounced emphatically To find out which is the emphatical word consider the chief design of the writer and that word which shews such design most is the word to be uttered emphatically  When a noun is the emphatical word and at∣tended with an adjective the stroke of the voice should be on the noun and the adjective be only swelled unless it appears that the stress is to be laid on the adjective The emphatic words in the fol∣lowing passage are printed in Italics  Hail  Source  of Beings universal  Soul  Of Heav'n and Earth essential  Presence  hail  But where two words are set in opposition to each other and one is pronounced emphatically the other should be so too as in the sentence "If  they  attack  we  will attack for  our  cause is as good as  theirs  "  The emphasis is of such importance in reading and speaking that wrong placing it may alter the sense materially The following line is an old ex∣ample upon this subject  Will you ride to town today  By laying the emphasis on  will  the answer may be  yes  or  no  By laying it on  you  the answer may be "  No  but my  son  will"  By laying it on  ride  the answer may be "I in∣tend to  walk  "  By placing it on the word  town  the answer may be "No I shall ride to my  farm  "  And laying it on  today  the answer may be "Not until  tomorrow  "  Last of all lay no emphasis on words where there should none be laid for this is as great a mark of ignorance as not laying it where it should be laid  Rules for reading English verse  The general rule is to pronounce it as if it wer  prose but with more deliberation to observe th  stops with great exactness placing the accent whe  it ought to be placed as will be shewn hereafter and the emphasis upon the proper words on each line Though there should be no stop at the end of the line the reader should pause whilst he can count one merely to give notice to the hearer that the line is ended and if the last word will bear two sounds as words ending in  y  will give it tha  which chymes best with its sister line I mean that line with which it is designed to rhyme  For example  Were I but once from bondage free  I'd never sell my liberty  Here  ty  in liberty is sounded as  tee  but in the following line it should be sounded as  ti  My soul ascends above the sky  And triumphs in her liberty  However whether pronounced as  tee  or  ti  the last syllable should be so feebly uttered as not to fix any stop or accent upon it  If verse be read with the above attention and still sound harsh upon the ear the fault is not in the reader but the poet for those verses are not well penned that cannot be read gracefully by the common rules of pronunciation  In verses of three syllables the accent is to be placed on the st and d Thus  He´re we ma´y  Thin´k and pra´y  E´re that De´ath  Sto´ps our brea´th  In verses of four syllables the accent is to be placed on the d and th Thus  With ra´vish'd ea´rs  The Mo´narch hea´rs  DRYDEN  In verses of six syllables on every other syl∣lable Thus  Though i´n the u´tmost pea´k  Awhi´le we do´ remai´n  Amo´ngst the mou´ntains ble´ak  Expo´s'd to sle´et or ra´in  No spo´rt nor hou´rs shall brea´k  To e´xerci´se our

short poems on the d th th and th Thus  And ma´y at la´st my wea´ry ag´e  Find ou´t the pe´aceful He´rmitag´e  MILTON  In those of ten which is heroic or tragic poetry on the d th th th and th Thus
