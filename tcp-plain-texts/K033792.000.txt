 CHEAP REPOSITORY  KING DIONYSIUS AND SQUIRE DAMOCLES A New Song on an Old Story Proper to be sung at all Feasts and Merrymakings  THERE was a heathen man sir  Belonging to a King  And still it was his plan sir  To covet every thing  And if you don't believe me  I'll name him if you please  For let me not deceive ye  'Twas one Squire Damocles  He thought that jolly living  Must every joy afford  And knew of no misgiving  While round the festive board  He wanted to be great sir  And fed on fare delicious  And have his feasts in state sir  Just like King Dionysius  The King to cure his longing  Prepar'd a feast so fine  That all the Court were thronging  To see the Courtier dine  And there to tempt his eye sir  Was fish and flesh and fowl  And when he was adry sir  He had a brimming bowl  Nor did the King forbid him  From drinking all he could  The Monarch never chid him  But fill'd him with his food  O then to see the pleasure  Squire Damocles exprest  'Twas joy beyond all measure  Was ever man so blest  With greedy eyes the Squire  Devour'd each costly dainty  You'd think he did aspire  To eat as much as twenty  But just as he prepar'd sir  Of bliss to take his swing  O how the man was scar'd sir  By this so cruel King  When he to eat intended  Lo just above his head  He spied a sword suspended  All by a single thread  How did it change the feasting  To wormwood and to gall  To think while he was tasting  The pointed sword might fall  Then in a moment's time sir  He loath'd the luscious feast  And dreaded as a crime sir  The brimming bowl to taste  Now if you're for applying  The story I have told  I think there's no denying  'Tis worth its weight in gold  Ye gay who view this stranger  And pity his sad case  And think there was great danger  In Damocles's case  Come let this aweful truth  In all your minds be stor'd  That DEATH o'er every youth  Hangs like a pointed sword  And tho' you see no reason  To check your mirth at all  In some sad drunken season  The sword on you may fall  So learn while at your ease  You drink down draughts delicious  To think of Damocles  And old King Dionysius
