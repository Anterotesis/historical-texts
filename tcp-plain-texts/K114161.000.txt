DEDICATION  To Mrs JORDAN  MADAM  IN the Hours of Meditation when the Mind was on its researches for a Patroness to the following Petit Drama I was not long at a loss for One to whom I might with propriety pay my respects The very conspicuous figure you have made upon the Stage brought your Merits to my view and from those I thought there could be no impropriety in my laying this Trifle at your feet The tutelary Sisters Melpomene and Thalia who preside over all the Scenic Arts have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pedestal so high that Envy lowers her scowling front whene'er she casts her jaundiced Eye upon your exalted Station for you justly assimulate the pathetic manners of the one and fascinate with the  bewitching archness of the other This perhaps may look like flattery but those who know me know  that flattery is a talent which I never yet possessed  and for the want of which perhaps I may have hatched some Snakes and Scorpions who have endeavoured to breathe their venom upon the blossoms of my reputation In the present instance certain malevolant Competiters attempted to sting my rising hopes and disconcert the eminent and arduous exertions of the Performers to whom I am so much indebted on this Piece's first assayyet I had the satisfaction to see it baffle all their Spleen and now Madam I submit it to the APPROBATION of the PUBLIC and hope it will receive your PROTECTION  I have the Honor to Subscribe myself MADAM your most Humble and Obedient Servant  GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY  Store Street Bedford Square  ADVERTISEMENT  THE PRINTER begs leave to observe that the Reviewers of Theatricals in the MORNING HERALD and other respectable PRINTS who saw the Representation as well as the Editors of the LONDON EUROPEAN NEW LADY'S and other MAGAZINES have spoken of this New Piece in very Respectful Terms  "That it is replete with wit whim and good humour and exhibits a well timed satire on the bent of fanciful individuals demonstrating that  Every Man  has his  Hobby  and that all mankind are at some period of Life or other the  Dupes of Fancy  Upon the whole they pronounce this Farce to surpass mediocrity and that its merits justly deserve that kind reception from the Public which it has experienced"  The Author is well known to the world by his Lectures on Mimicry Imitations and other humourous writings  and all lovers of dramatic productions and the Public in general will be highly gratified by a sight and perusal of this Comic Piece  On it's first appearance at the Hay Market some objections were made to it's  length  particularly in the Dinner Scene but by the Author's Judicious curtailment for future Representation every objection of this kind will be obviated It is however printed as originally written and such parts of it marked as were omitted in the representation It is presumed it will be performed this Summer at many of the Watering Places throughout the Kingdom and that it will be brought forward with some amendment and alteration next Season at the King's Theatre  THE PRINTER  PROLOGUE  Written by a Friend of the Author  THE ACTOR COMING ON THE STAGE AS IF IN ANGER WITH THE PROMPTER  I WISH your Prologues all were in the Sea  You're sure to saddle ev'ry one on me  Each trembling Author shews a frighten'd mind  And cries to mePray will you be so kind  As say a word or two to paliate  The apprehensions that around me wait  A pretty taskand nothing more in brief  Then feeling guilty hollows out"Stop Thief"  Should the thing pleasepray what do I get by't  I'll tell you whatI prologuise each night  Wit like a Diamond is bright and scarce  Our Author's Wit poor soul is all  a Farce    You'll see it clearer ere the matter's ended  But saying little is the soonest mended  I've got a part to play'tis time to budge  Hoping that while you listen you will judge  With Mercynor make absolute the  Case  Lest the poor Author fall into disgrace  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  TINTEM a Florist

Lazybones why you have been looking at yourself this halfhour and now you look as if you were frightened out of your wits  GABY  Frighten'dfrighten'd at what  DOLLY  At yourself to be sure and I do not wonder at it why your head looks like a rumpled hen that has gone through a hedge backwards and your face is as pale as a parsnip  GABY  You are making me out a strange creature forsooth may'nt a body tie on one's neckcloth without being frightened out of one's wits at the lookingglass  DOLLY  Tying on your neckcloth trulyheavens what a slovenwhy you have not above half tied itI suppose you will be for making love to me with your collar open againYou look in the face for all the world like the picture of the starved poet in my master's dressing room  GABY  Faith and troth you are full of your skits Mrs Dolly but for all that I have heard people say that to be careless is to be modish  DOLLY  Modish modish ha ha haI never saw such a modish ninny as you before it is enough to make one kill one's self with laughing I am sure you shall never go into the parlour such a comical figure as thatonly look at yourself again  GABY  Why how would you have me look  DOLLY  Like a man to be sureYou that are drawn for the militia toowhy you ought to look like a soldier  GABY  How in the name of patience am I to look like a soldier before I'm taught  DOLLY  Let me put on your neckcloth and I'll shew you how  GABY  Ah that you shall and thank you too  DOLLY  Kneel down then and you shall see what a comely figure I will make of you  GABY  Kneel aye that I will and pray too if you like it my dear little chickabiddy  GABY kneels while DOLLY ties his neckcloth so tight that it almost choaks him  DOLLY  There there thereyou seem now as if you had a little blood in your face you look like a soldier now with a witness  GABY  Struggling  Murder murder murderOh pray  DOLLY  Ha ha haWell now since I have brought you to your prayers I am satisfied and you shall be releas'dbut it is a pity you had not been choak'd you look'd so pretty  GABY  And should you have lik'd to have seen me choak'd Dolly  DOLLY  Choak me if I should not  GABY  Why Dolly now that's so cruel of you  DOLLY  Whybecause you're such a lazy lubberly slovenly creatureDon't you know that this is Saturday that Alderman Grub is coming to visit Master and you've got nothing ready  GABY  Lord help you be'ant I always ready what would the woman have me do  DOLLY  Whatwhy there are all the knives to clean my Master's new wig to comb out the tobacco pipes to wax at the ends and the sanddishes to be got in readinessyou know that they smoke like a couple of Turks  GABY  Lord bless me I had forgot all that to be sure  DOLLY  I knew you had you've a precious memory but my Master would not be apt to forget you I fancy if you had not got them all prepared in timeyou know he is never so happy as when surrounded with smoke  GABY  Nor I neither DollyLord it is my heart's delight  DOLLY  I'm glad to hear that for it convinces me that you will make a better soldier  GABY  What are they so fond of smoke then  DOLLY  Every good soldier is fond of the smoke of gunpowder to be sure  GABY  Oh I never lik'd that ever since I had like to have been blown up with it the last fifth of November I'll tell you all about ityou must  know that I had got a whole pound of powder and was making of squibs  DOLLY  Making of squibs was you and so I suppose you went off in a cracker  Bell rings  GABY  Oddsbobbs Master's bell rings  DOLLY  Aye and if he catches you here with your gunpowder stories he will be for blowing us both up  Exit GABY and DOLLY  SCENE II  Mr TINTEM is discovered in his morning gown and velvet cap surrounded with garden pots flowersticks and a pen stuck in his cap with which he marks some of the labels  TINTEM  They say that every man has his hobby horse and without one has something in pursuit life is as insipid as tripe without mustard or vinegarMy hobbyhorse is my flowergarden and I can ride that with safety for I shall never be afraid of that kicking me in the stomach or breaking my neck with stumblingI expect my friend Grub here by and by and think that I shall amaze him with the variety of colours which I shall present to him in my amphitheatreMr Grub has his hobbyhorse too but his horse is a butterflyI often tell him that he is as fond of pursuing a fly as a fish or a swallowBut I must make haste he will be here soon and if we should not happen to have the dinner on table exactly at  one  he will be for stinging me with reproaches and buzzing in my ears like a gnat  Enter GABY  GABY  Did you ring Sir  TINTEM  Yes to be sureyet one would have thought that you had forgot it by your being so long in comingWhat was you about  GABY  Nothing Sir  TINTEM  I suppose soI should have been angry with you had you not told me the truth for that is one of the hardest things in the world to get at  GABY  Oh Sir I always tell the truth  TINTEM  You are mistaken I am afraid and have marr'd all you only told me truth by way of accident because you was too dull of invention and had not time to tell me a falshood  GABY  I never tell a falshood Sir but when I cannot help it  TINTEM  WellI hope Dolly told you that Alderman Grub was coming to dine with me to day  GABY  Yes Sir  TINTEM  And are all things in readiness  GABY  YesSirNoSir  TINTEM  Yes Sir no Sirthere seems to be a lie and a true saying both in a breath which of them am I to believe  GABY  Which you please Sir  TINTEM  I suppose sotherefore I am inclin'd to believe that you have got nothing ready  GABY  'Faith Sir you have hit it  TINTEM  Hit it have IWhy you audacious Scoundrel I have a good mind to hit you I'll knock you down you blockheadWhere is my Wig  GABY  Upon the block Sir  TINTEM  I wonder that  you  have it not  on  then is it dress'd  GABY  No Sir not quite dress'd  TINTEM  I declare I have a good mind to give you a good dressinggo to your brother block and finish it immediately it is insufferable to have two blockheads in the house at once But first take this and bid the gard'ner to place it in the Amphitheatre the third row between that of Arrogance and Indifference being a modist flower its blushes will be the more distinctly seen  Exit GABY  "What a strange thing is fear it sits as Lord Chief Justice of our Conscience and often extorts a falshood or makes us tell the truth by being overaw'd from Apprehension of ConvictionThis fellow of mine take him in common as a servant is not a bad onehe has always an inclination to tell the truth yet his heart is never couragious enough to prevent his give way to a falshoodBut how goes time  pulls out his watch  odds so it is almost twelve o'clock we shall have Master Grub here by  one  "  Rings the bell  Enter DOLLY  DOLLY  Did you ring Sir  TINTEM  Aye how goes on the Dinner  DOLY  As fast as the Jack and Fire can make it SirCook Sir is broiling away like a posthorse in the Dogdays  TINTEM  And if she should happen to be a minute too late my friend Grub would have no more mercy upon her than the hasty rider upon his jaded steed  DOLLY  Cook you know Sir is a little rough in her paces if he were to fall foul of her he might stand a chance to be flung and get his bastings  TINTEM  Where's my NeiceMrs Prateadace  DOLLY  In her dressing room Sir  TINTEM  Tell her it is Twelve o'ClockMr Grub will be here presently bid her get ready to receive him and not be behind hand as she generally is upon these occasions  DOLLY  Oh never fear her Sir she may be ready to receive him in order to please you but she will be the more glad to get rid of him to please herself  TINTEM  What do you mean by that you impudent baggagehey  DOLLY  I can hardly tell what I mean myself Sirbut there is a certain old gentleman that will acquaint you soon enough I warrant you  TINTEM  An old GentlemanWhat old Gentleman Huzzy  DOLLY  Why Sir the old gentleman that goes seesaw seesaw in the face of our clock who has got only one lock of hair on his forehead and a scythe in his handold Master Time  TINTEM  Was there ever such insolenceAway with you then and don't stay loosing  your  time here but mind your business and take care that every thing be properly placed  Exit DOLLY  Mean while I'll go and take a peep into the garden and like a good and prudent Minister see that my affairs be properly arrang'd fit for the eye of public inspection  Exit  SCENE III  The House  Enter Mr WILLINGFORD disguised as a Ballad Singer with Songs  Here is the place and this the Temple wherein resides the Goddess of my affectionswhile I like a poor and devoted Pilgrim have wander'd hither thus disguis'd to render up my offerings and soothe those pangs of love which rankle in my breastI have taken this disguise lest I should be discover'd by the imperious and avaricious eye of one that is fix'd by fate as a guard to check the inclinations of her lenient bosomTherefore will put my little stratagem into execution by singing an old English Ballad and see if I cannot attract the notice of some of the Domestics to whom I may communicate my purpose and thro' whom I may perhaps have an opportunity of seeing the beloved object of my heart  Song Mr WILLINGFORD  Of all the Girls c  DOLLY and GABY enter in the middle of the Song and listenand when it is finished go up to WILLINGFORD and buy one each  DOLLY  Faith you sing well Master let me have one of your Songs I like them vastly  WILLINGFORD gives a Song  GABY  And so do I come let me have one too  WILLINGFORD gives him two  Nay you have given me too manyI only ask'd for one and you have given me two  WILLINGFORD  Why did'nt you say  one two  and that makes a couple to be sure  GABY  Does it so Mr Sharpshins but one will do for me I thank you tho' I wish it had been Dolly of our Alleyinstead of Sally of our Alley then I should have been singing it all day to my sweetheart here  DOLLY  Sweetheartyou're a pretty fellow for a sweetheart to be surecome come come along in and mind your business or else instead of a  sweetheart  you may chance to meet with a  sour  face from my Master by and bye  As they are going WILLINGFORD interrupts them  WILLINGFORD  Dolly Dolly  DOLLY  Dolly DollyHow the deuce did you come by my name so pat  GABY  Why I told him to be sure  WILLINGFORD  Don't you know me  DOLLY  Know

sure as I am alive it is Mr Willingford why it has struck me almost into an Egyptian Mummy  DOLLY  Come in Sir pray come in and let me hide you as fast as I can I would not have my Master see you for all the world  GABY  Nor I eithernot but that I am glad to see you don't you be afraid of thatha ha ha I can't help laughing at itthis is a comical kind of a joke  DOLLY  Come in Sir for heaven's sake and let me hide you or else it will be a  Tragical  joke I'm afraid  GABY  Aye away with you Sir away with you for your own sake for Dolly's sake and for my sake we'll take care of youtho' hide and seek is no bad game by the byeI know one that will be glad to find you  Exeunt Omnes  SCENE IV  Miss TINTEM in her dressingroom reading  MISS TINTEM  The story which I have been reading puts me exactly in mind of poor Mr Willingford and myselfHis father died and left him nothing but a good education and the wide and hazardous world to ramble in  Mine  bequeath'd me all he had by his  will  but left me no  will of my own  he has made me over to the care of an avaricious uncle until I arrive at the age of twentyone which thank heaven is almost at hand yet he wishes to transfer me to a beastly creature who would fain present himself to me as a husbandbut I will die firstI am told they cannot force me to marry any body against my will and that is a comfortable consolationAh poor Mr Willingford when I think of thee  Dolly speaking in a hurry from the staircase  DOLLY  Miss Miss Missey  MISS TINTEM  What's the matter  DOLLY  Come down stairs and I'll tell you  MISS TINTEM  Why

Charming you are a dear good creature and I love you for itBut what is to be done I know not what to do or what to sayI am all confusion I that should at this moment be nothing but contrivance and

what  MISS TINTEM  Wellwhat thenmy dear good girlwhat then  DOLLY  What thenwhy then you will have nothing to do after dinner but to let Mr Willingford know that you are alone and you won't want

DOLLY  DinedWhy I am told that your true lovers never want to eat  MISS TINTEM  Prithee don't be foolish  DOLLY  Don't make yourself uneasy Miss I was neither so foolish or so brutish but I had thought enough about me to take proper care of him  MISS TINTEM  In what respect  DOLLY  In respect to his dinnerfor I have sent him up a cold  Collection  as they call it and provided him with some veal and ham the cold giblet pye some cold pudding by way of settling his love and a bottle of wine to wash it down whenever he pleases  MISS TINTEM  Excellentyou delight me  Bell rings  that is my uncle's bellGo and ask what he wants and let me know immediately  Exit DOLLY  I am delighted with the frankness and attachment of this good natured girl but extreamly aggitated at the state of poor Mr Willingford sure it is the most provoking and tantalizing situation in the worldThe man I love and whom I have not seen this month to have him under the very roof with me and even there depriv'd the sight of him when instead of receiving him as I ought to have him lock'd up in a state of apprehension and fear is hard indeed  Enter DOLLY  DOLLY  Miss my Master is in the strangest mood imaginable and desires that you will come down immediately  MISS TINTEM  Tell him that I am coming  Exit DOLLY  he will find me in as strange a mood as himselfI have just as little inclination to set down to dinner as I have to hear the conversation that I am likely to be pestered with while I am at the table  Exit MISS TINTEM  SCENE V  Changes to a dressingroom and discovers Mr TINTEM buckling on his shoes still in his cap with his hat over it he rings the bell  Enter GABY  GABY  Did you want me Sir  TINTEM  Where's my Wig Sirrah Must I dine in my Nightcap think you go and fetch it immediately or

her infernal Tantrums  GABY  No Sirbut as I hope to be sav'd I was only getting a sop in the pan and the great splawfooted creature pushed me down and so to save my head from going into the fire I tumbl'd with my hands into the Drippingpan which scalded my poor fingers so much that I was oblig'd to to run to Dr Seret's in order as a body might say to get them  nointed  before I could make use of them again  MR TINTEM  I wish you and the Cook were both in Heaven  GABY  Heaven forbid Sir  MR TINTEM  Heaven forbid indeedGo and fetch my wig I say bring it to me done or undone  GABY  I'm gone

heartily glad to see youalways punctualpunctual as the clockyou gentlemen of the City look sharp after Time  GRUB  Consider the hour Master Tintem it is dinner Time and my stomach generally looks sharp after thatbut my eye my eye Mr Tintem at this moment looks very sharp after something elseMy dear Miss Tintem how do you doMy dear little sweetheart how do you do  MISS TINTEM  I thank you Sir but very indifferent  GRUB  IndifferentI'm very sorry for that but I hope you will never be indifferent to me  GABY  aside  You seem to be but a very indifferent creature at the best  MR TINTEM  Come my good friendSit downsay what I shall help you too  GRUB  Why Sir if you please I will thank you for a little of the roasted PigI am glad you have got a young pig there is nothing that I love better

but what is young  GRUB  No to be sure  speaking with his mouthful  MISS TINTEM  Then you never can expect that I can be fond of you  GABY  aside  That's a douser for you old one  MR TINTEM  The devil's in the girl to be sure you'll never get Mr Grub for a husband while you pass such compliments as those upon him  GRUB  Oh never mind the little Pussfor as to compliments and all  them there  kind of things I never minded  them  nay to tell you the truth I always hated compliments  eating  MR TINTEM  I should think it strange indeed if you could ever love them especially if they came in the manner my Niece bestows them on you  GRUB  Ah let the little thing say what she will she will never be able to make me quarrel with my Victuals  MISS TINTEM  That I really believe  aside  MR

Master Grub  GRUB  Both if you please my very good friend  GABY  'Tis a pity he had not the whole Duck feathers and all  aside  MR TINTEM  That's right I like every body to speak their mind it shews the proper freedom of spirit and saves a great deal of unnecessary trouble  GRUB  I  likes  Freedom and I  hates  troubleyou may be sure of that by the speeches you must have heard me make in GuildhallI say nothing now but don't you think that we are in a sweet situation  MR TINTEM  Sweet not very sweet at present for you must confess we have been rather sowered of late  GRUB  Soweredpray by what means  MR TINTEM  Why I think the sweetness of our situation has been greatly abated by the high price your Company has set upon Sugars  GRUB  Oh that has prov'd a monstorous good thing to our Company  MR TINTEM  But monstorous things are not at all times the most pleasant either to the Eye or to the Mind and I know of no monster so frightful to the greatest part of his Majesty's Subjects as that Monster call'd Monopoly  GRUB  A Monopoly I never saw any of  them there  creatures in all my LifePray Sir what are they like And what part of the world do these Monopolies come from  GABY  aside  Lord they are to be seen at Exeter Change or the Lyceum every Day  MR TINTEM  From all parts I fancy but it is an animal that seems to thrive more in this Country than any other  GRUB  Ah Master Tintem you seem to be more acquainted with  these here  matters than I amyou have travelled a good deal you know I'm told that you have been to all the Wateringplaces in England but as to my part I was never any farther than MargateI went there and came back by Water which made me so sick of the Journey that I don't think I shall ever go there again  MR TINTEM  No indeed  GRUB  No not IBesides they are such a set of imposing Rascals that they would often charge me Sixpence for a halfpenny's worth of Small beer and you know one can get a quart of good sound porter in London for threepence halfpenny  MR TINTEM  Ah you will find imposition in every part of the Kingdom nowadays  GRUB  A little more Duck if you please  GABY  I knew he'd finish it  aside  MR TINTEM  How do you like itdon't you find the sauce rather Predominant  GRUB  "I have not tasted any yetI wish you would give me a little of it"  MR TINTEM  "A little of what"  GRUB  "Why a little of the Predominant as you call itI suppose that is some new kind of sauce I wish you would give me a little of it"  MR and MISS TINTEM endeavour to smother a laugh  MR TINTEM  I beg pardon Master Grub but you can't help being entertaining  GRUB  Aye that's my wayI'm generally said to be the life of the company  GABY  I'll be hang'd if he be'ant as great a Gaby as myself  aside  MR TINTEM  Will you drink a glass of wine  GRUB  With all my heart and I dare say my little intended will not refuse to join meI'll give you a toast if I can remember oneoddsbobbs I have itI'll give you  "Love without Interest"  MISS

hope it is no apoplexy  MISS TINTEM  No I do not think it is that I fancy it was only the toast stuck in his stomach  MR TINTEM  to GABY  Toast toastwhy you damn'd villain have you put toast in the wine  GABY  Toast SirtoastLord Sir I never did such a foolish thing in all my life  MR TINTEM  to Miss  Why did not you say that the toast stuck in his stomach  MISS TINTEM  I only meant the sentimental toast which he had given himself  Mr TINTEM  Oh he revives  GRUB  recovering  Mercy upon me where am I  GABY  In our house Sir  GRUB  Oh my poor headOh my stomach I thought that I should

afternoon I protest  GRUB  The weather is chearful enough it is true but as to myself I am melancholy enough  Mr TINTEM  I am sorry for thatwhy should you be melancholywhat's the matter  GRUB  That little Niece of your's runs strangely in my head  MR TINTEM  I'm glad to hear that 'tis a good sign  GRUB  And yet my mind is not perfectly at ease about her  MR TINTEM  Better and better still I should be sorry if it were  GRUB  I am very much obliged to you for your kindness it seems to be a laughing matter to you but it is otherwise to me  GABY  I wish he be'ant love sick already  aside  MR TINTEM  Ha ha haquite touched I seepoor Mr Grub she seems to have got fast hold of you my friend  GRUB  Nay not not so fast as you imagine  MR TINTEM  What is the matter with you then  GRUB  Why to tell you the truth I do not think that she seems to pay me so much attention as I could wish  MR TINTEM  No  GRUB  Nothere is very litttle affection I am afraid about that tittering heart of her'sI doubt she does not love me truly  MR TINTEM  Not love younever trouble yourself about thatI'll make her love you  GRUB  What whether she will or notthat must be a curious secret indeed  MR TINTEM  Aye I know the proper physic for the ladies when they happen to be disobedient  GRUB  Physic  MR TINTEM  Aye physic  GABY  I wish they may not be going to give the poor creature lovepowder  aside  MR TINTEM  She is in my power at present and  shall  marry you whether she will or not and when she is yours you know what you have to do  GRUB  What is that  MR TINTEM  Why you have nothing to do then but to keep her under your thumb  GABY  Under his thumb and if he does I wish she may not slip through his fingers  aside  GRUB  I am told there is a Mr Willingford a young spark to whom she turns a willing ear if so it will be a difficult matter to wean her of him  GABY  You are right enough there old Gentleman  aside  MR TINTEM  Oh never let that give you any concern he is nothing but a Boy and a Beggar  GRUB  As to his being a Beggar that will be no impediment especially if he has been ingenious enough to coax her Heart from her  MR TINTEM  Oh never mind the heart so you have got the BodyPossession you know is every thing  GRUB  Aye but the mind often sets the Body capering  MR TINTEM  Confound your capering apprehensions I sayWhy you talk like a Simpletonwhat can you be afraid of  GRUB  There was a confounded Stag's head and an aukward pair of horns in your hall which look'd butt in my face as I entered your house to day and I cannot help thinking them  omnious  GABY  What a cowardly old fool  aside  Mr TINTEM  Mr Grub Mr Grub take care what you say"My Niece was the daughter of my brothermy brother was the son of my mother and my mother was the pattern of VirtueNo Mr Grub if you have any qualms of that kind in your mind you've mistaken the stock" the blood of the Tintem's is of a peculiar dye pure as the peerless Stream and chaste as the mountain Snow  GRUB  And as cold too I'm afraid  MR TINTEM  Cold  GRUB  Aye cold I thinkwhy your niece always looks as chilly as an Icicle at me  GABY  One would think she was dead by his talking  aside  MR TINTEM  You don't like the match perhaps  GRUB  Yes my very good friend I  likes  the match very wellbutbut  MR TINTEM  You would like the money without the match I suppose  GABY  The devil doubt him  aside  GRUB  No noI don't say that either your Niece is young and beautiful a little sweet creature any body might be fond of and I will do her the justice to say that I think she would like any young fellow better than me  GABY  You never said a truer thing in all your life  aside  Mr TINTEM  Well well we'll drop the subject at present and after another interview or two you will be better able to judge of her disposition  GRUB  I think so too and therefore let us go and amuse ourselves with a sight of your Hobbyhorse as you call it  MR TINTEM  And so you shallgo you on Gaby and tell Jonas the gardner to place this flower as I told you before then return home and fetch me the key of the pineryI have forgot it  Gives him the flower  GABY  Where did you say it was to be placed Sir between  'gnorance  and  impudence  MR TINTEM  No Mr Impudencebetween  arrogance  and  indifference  they are two very fashionable flowers  Exit GABY  GRUB  And therefore must be a kin to the gentry Gaby was talking of I suppose  MR TINTEM  Cousin Germins I assure you  Exit TINTEM and GRUB  SCENE II  The DrawingRoom in TINTEM's House  Enter MR WILLINGFORD MISS TINTEM and DOLLY  DOLLY  ThereI'm glad you are once more got together and I wish that Old Harry would break the shins of him that parts you  Exit DOLLY  MISS TINTEM  What a comical girl  MR WILLINGFORD  What a good one she has been the providential instrument of our present blessed interview  MISS TINTEM  Do not call that thing blessed which chance may have an opportunity of overturning  MR WILLINGFORD  My dear Miss Tintem I rest on hope and trust in providence you know I am a child of her's and Chance must be a churl indeed should she at this moment thwart me in my wishes  MISS TINTEM  What are your wishes  MR WILLINGFORD  It rather surprises me that you should ask  MISS TINTEM  I do not doubt but you will be polite enough to resolve me then  MR WILLINGFORD  Most certainly and that from my heartah me I wish that you were mine but that you know already and your asking me to tell you now seems as if you doubted me  MISS TINTEM  I do not doubt but when I consider the present state of things I am rather surprised that you should persevere in running after me especially when I shall tell you what a formidable rival you have to encounter  MR WIL  A rival is it possible  MISS TINTEM  It is true and that is more  MR WIL  I am sorry for it  MISS TINTEM  And so am I for he is a favourite of my Uncle's and a wealthy one also  MR WIL  And perhaps you love him too  MISS TINTEM  You shall see him by and by then you will be able to judge if it be possible for me to resist him  MR WIL  Indeed this is a circumstance I did not expect this gives me a pain more exquisite then ever I felt beforeIs it possible  MISS TINTEM  Is what possible  MR WIL  That you should love him  MISS TINTEM  Nay I have not told you thatyou should stay till you are convinced Amiable creature but I'll torture him no further  aside  Come come chear upone would think that you suspected meit carries danger with it if your doubts begin to quicken only on  report  MR WIL  "  Report  is a dangerous fiend seldom to be credited but the doubts I have arose from what you said yourself and never did I hold your word so slight as not to credit whatever you have been pleased to tell me"  MISS TINTEM  "I do believe you and therefore III"  MR WIL  "Speak out"  MISS TINTEM  "It isit is  "Time enough yet"  as the song says"  MR WIL  "But shall I tell you what I hope you was going to say"  MISS TINTEM  "That might shew too much conceit in you perhaps and put a maiden to the blush"  MR WIL  Wellit it enoughI shall rest satisfied without doing the one or saying the other and trust to the event  MISS TINTEM  But to digress a little from the present parley Dolly told me of all your stratagem how she discovered you and that you sang charmingly  MR WIL  I am afraid Dolly has deceived you  MISS TINTEM  Will you give me leave to judge  MR WIL  I can deny you nothing as I know you have generosity and candour enough to overlook defect when poor Endeavour does her utmost to oblige  MISS TINTEM  I hope so  MR WIL  I will try to sing you a little song which I made respecting the situation of a poor recruit whom I once met upon a journey lamenting that his ill stars had parted him from his favourite fair one  SONG  THE POOR RECRUIT  I  As I've plodded my way to some country town  Full many a wearisome day  My purse has contained but a scanty halfcrown  And that has soon melted away  II  Oft weary and sad on some wint'ry road  With rain I've been wet to the skin  Of my knapsack grown tir'd I've sought for abode  At some friendly good Alehouse or Inn  III  I've hop'd that good Fortune in turning her wheel  Would cast me perchance on the place  Where the wound in my bosom wou'd instantly heal  At the sight of my Sally's dear face  IV  She grieves for she knows how I'm destin'd to roam  On the strength of my furlow to rest  And then she oft' wishes her Allen at home  To bury his cares in her breast  Enter DOLLY in a hurry  DOLLY  I beg pardon for interrupting you but I could not help telling you that Gaby is just return'd from the Garden and says there had like to have been a sad piece of work about you both  MISS TINTEM  What was the matter then  MR WIL  Do they know that I am here  DOLLY  Nobut Master and old Grub had like to have quarrelled about you  MISS TINTEM  In what respect  DOLLY  Why Mr Grub had found out saving your presence Miss that you had an affection for Mr Willingford  MISS TINTEM  That is odd indeedaffection for Mr Willingfordwho could tell him such a piece of news as thatit is more than Mr Willingford knows himself  DOLLY  Lord Missbut I'll say no more  MR WIL  What had this quarrel like to have risen from  DOLLY  Whatwhy Mr Grub was jealous of you to be sure and talked about the pair of stag's horns in the hall staring him in the face this morning which had given him the qualms  MR WIL  I wish they had butted him in the stomach with all my heart  MISS TINTEM  I have not ability to find out all this mystery I confess  MR WIL  'Tis no matter  DOLLY  I dare say they will quarrel I am sure it would be the highest entertainment to you both were you to go and listen to their comical conversation  M WIL  Is this Mr Grub as you call him the gentleman you signified to be my rival  MISS TINTEM  The same I promised that you should see him therefore we can go and stand with safety and unseen behind the old yew hedge near the amphitheatre where you may at once behold his delicious person and hear his bewitching conversation  MR WIL  Agreed  MISS TINTEM  "Dolly you must be sure to take care should we be put to flight to find a ready shelter again for Mr Willingford"  DOLLY  "Put to flightI know of no shelter in such a case that would be so convenient as a tight post chaise and four good horses to hurry you both out of harms way in an instant"  MR WIL  "An excellent thought"  MISS TINTEM  "Is the girl bewitched"  DOLLY  "Not so bewitched but I could tell you which would be the best road you could take"  MR WIL  "Bravo"  MISS TINTEM  "Prithee girl don't be foolish come let us go and listen to the learned disquisitions of my sagacious Uncle and the trite observations of your more formidable rival"  MR WIL  "With all my heart"  Exeunt Omnes  SCENE III  The Garden with a view of the Amphitheatre  Enter MR TINTEM and GRUB  MR TINTEM  Here they are Mr Grubhere are my beautiesthere's a display for youthere's an arrangement all the colours of the rainbow the eye is ravished with beholding and the nose with smelling  GRUB  This is truly a fine sight Master Tintem  MR TINTEM  Fine indeed though I say it Mr Grubthis is nature in her holidaycloaths you say you are fond of flowers Mr Grub  GRUB  So fond of them that I always buy a halfpenny nosegay when I can and stick it in my bosom whenever I go to church on a sunday  MR TINTEM  Ha ha haa halfpenny nosegay Mr GrubI beg your pardon but you make me laugha halfpenny nosegay trulythey must have been weeds my good friendweedswhat sort of flowers could they have been  GRUB  Sometimes a bunch of primroses or the lillies of the valley at other times I have treated myself with a few pale snowdrops or yellow crocuses which in my opinion are the first of flowers  MR TINTEM  The first of flowersha ha ha  GRUB  You must acknowledge that they are generally the first in the season  MR TINTEM  I will acknowledge that they are the first colour'd weeds which the spring throws up but we do not place them under the denomination of Flowers  GRUB  No  MR TINTEM  Noyou talk of putting a whole bunch of Flowers in your bosom for a halfpenny when many a single root of some of the Flowers now before you have cost me ten twenty nay thirty pounds  GRUB  Mercy on mewhy you make me tremble at the very Idea  MR TINTEM  Why should you tremble about it when I have told you it is my Hobbyhorse and there are many of your highflying dashers of the Turf will give you a thousand or fifteen hundred guineas for a Hobbyhorse that shall crack a hole in the Fortune or break the neck of his Rider before he has had him a Week  GRUB  Mercy on uswhen I think on the follies and extravagancies of the age I bless my stars that I happen'd to be born with so much prudence about me  MR TINTEM  Come come Mr Prudence do not arrogate so much to your own merityou have got your Hobbyhorse tooI am told that you had the liberality when you was at Mr Lottum's Auction the other day to give twenty guineas for a frame of dead Butterflies  GRUB  Why that is  neither here or there  as the saying isWe will not talk of  them there  things just now but  as to the matter of that  I don't know why I should not have my Hobbyhorse as you call it as well as any body else  MR TINTEM  To be sureto be sureyours you know is a fly and mine is a flower that is the differenceso we will drop the present parley and look before us  Enter MR WILLINGFORD MISS TINTEM DOLLY and GABY behind the Yew Hedge  GABY  There they are hard at it  MISS TINTEM  Hold your impertinence Mr Simpleton if we should be discovered it will mar all  aside  MR TINTEM  Here Mr Grub here's a flower for you what do you think I call this  GRUB  Nay I can't tell  MR TINTEM  Did you never see a sign which bore a resemblance to this  GRUB  A signI have seen the sign of the  FlowerdeLucey  the Rose and Crown and the Scotch Thistle which I suppose is one of the Flowers of  Edinborough  an inward laugh from behind  MR TINTEM  Aye but that is not the Ideadid you never see the sign of a General like this flower  GRUB  A General  Mr TINTEM  Aye a General  GRUB  No truly  MR TINTEM  Why then I'll tell youThat is the Duke of Cumberland  GRUB  The Duke of Cumberland  MR TINTEM  Aye the Great Duke of Cumberlandthat flower made its first appearance in the Botanical world in the Rebellion Fortyfivewas nam'd in honor of the British hero of that day and such a flower as this is enough to immortalize the memory of any General in the world  GRUB  What is it an  Evergreen  then  a tittering from behind  MR TINTEM  An EvergreenBless the manWhy you seem to have no Idea of vegetation at allno more taste for a flower than I have for a dead butterfly  GRUB  Yes I have generally got a good taste for them when they produce a good smell to me  smelling  but this flower seems to have no smell at all  MR TINTEM  Pshawhat the Duce has smell to do with the beauty of a Flowerit is the Colour we look atthe colour  GRUB  Odds soI suppose so  GABY  What a couple of comical creatures ha ha ha  from behind  GRUB  Wist WistI heard a strange kind of noise just nowyou hav'nt any  Varment  about the Garden have youno Polecats or WeaselsI am strangely fearful of those kind of gentryand as to a Ratthe very sight of a Rat would turn my whole  mast  of blood into a posset  shews great apprehensions which causes a laugh from behind  There again I am sure there are  Varment  about us  MR TINTEM  Verminthe Devil'Tis only some of those cursed Magpies who pestre the garden every day for the sake of the cherries  GRUB  Magpies I hate your Magpies they are the most hateful  omnious  bird that fliesI was at Cuckold's point the other day when I happened to be cross'd by one of those infernal Chatterboxes and in a minute or two after I had the misfortune to break both my shins over a Hogtrough at my Cousin Crumplet's the Baker's door which laid me up for a week  a laugh again  GRUB  There againthere are certainly  Varment  shews much fear  MR TINTEM  The Magpies I tell you the MagpiesLook you here my friend Grub since you are fond of a flower that has got a smellHere is one I fancy that will tickle your taste and your smell at the same time  Grub takes up the flower pot  Aye that's righttake it up and smell to itPut on your Spectacles and look at itthere is a Turban there is your Furr there is the very Sash and Sabre of the Emperor himself  GRUB  Emperor  MR TINTEM  Aye Emperorthat is the Emperor of Morocco  GRUB  The Emperor of Morocco why you deal in nothing but grand namesThis flower I perceive has got a charming smell this is something like a Flower the Emperor of Moroccogrand very granda fine sounding name I protest  Grub turns up his eyes with a kind of rapsodical ardour and by accident discovers a fine butterfly lets drop the flower pot and tumbles over it then gets up in a hurry with his hat in his hand pursuing the butterfly and crying out  Damme there goes the King of Bohemia  MR TINTEM  In a great rage runs and picks up the broken pot and the flower crying  Damn your King of Bohemia  GRUB  Damn your Emperor of Morocco I would not have lost my king of Bohemia for all the Emperors in the worldno not the Emperor of the Moon  MR TINTEM  You wretch you Nonentity you thing without an Idea  GRUB  You fool you Frantic you Daseyhunter you stem of a Dogrose you bud of a Crocus  you stinking root of a Daffy downdilly I would not have lost my King of Bohemia for all the nonsensical flowers in your garden  MR TINTEM  Why you Catterpiller you Bug you Beetle you Gnat you GrubI would not have had my Emperor destroy'd for all the contemptible collection of Insects which you have been scraping together these thirty yearsand give me leave to tell you Sir that you behave like a dirty fellow  GRUB  Damme Sirrah if it were not for fear of your taking the Law of me I would tell you a bit of my mind  MR TINTEM  Mind mindwhy you have no mind you are a meer insectbut I'll close your mouth for you

Willingford was here with all my heart you should see that I would give her to him before your face  GRUB  "No you would notyou love yourself too much for thatI know how fond you would be of giving her fortune to a Begger I dare you to thatI dare you to that"  MR TINTEM  "I shall choak with rage"  They walk petulantly backward and forward upon the stage crossing each other  DOLLY  "Now SirNow my dear Missnow is your time"  GABY  "Aye now or never"  MR WIL  "Aye now is the time indeed"  MISS TINTEM  "I am terrified to death"  MR WIL  "Never fear have a good heart think of the eventdo not shrink while such a plea as ours depends upon the moment"  From behind  MR TINTEM  "Mr Grub give me leave to tell you Sir that I think you have behaved like an arrant scoundrel"  GRUB  "Take care what you say or I'll make the Gentlemen of the great Wig shake their heads at youthey'll make a good breakfast of the word Scoundrel in Westminster Hall I warrant youtherefore I would advise you to take care what you say"  MR TINTEM  "You ought rather to be afraid of what I may do"  GRUB  "Why what would you do"  MR TINTEM  "What"  GRUB  "Aye what"  MR TINTEM  "If young Willingford was here I would convince you in a minute"  GRUB  "You would be for presenting your Niece to him I suppose"  MR TINTEM  Cripple me if I would not  GRUB  Cripple me if I think you would  MR TINTEM  Would to Heaven he

given you a fair trimmingand now I will sing with the Poet"Revenge revenge revenge shall appease my restless spright"  sings much agitated  GRUB  Why you seem as if you were crazy and foam at the mouth like a mad dogyou have made a fine hand of it truly to give your Niece to such a vagabond as that who has not got a farthing in the world and in all likelihood will spend her fortune in a month  MR WIL  Sir I will convince you that he has bestowed his Niece upon one that loves her and one that is too sensible of the principles of a gentleman and a man of honor than to suffer himself and this amiable lady to be treated with illmanners by such a scoundrel as you are  GRUB  Take care what you say a scoundrel Sirrah  MR WIL  You shall see that I neither fear what I say or care what I do if you don't leave the room immediately you shall feel the force of my resentment "In respect to such a bloated piece of consequence as you areGo home and take this by way of hast'ning your journeyTheretherethere take that"  kicks him off the stage  GRUB  Oh you Villain I'll make you bleed for this treatment I will  Exit GRUB  DOLLY  Take care of the  Varment  GABY  Take care of the

Sir  MR TINTEM  What you've got your Hobbyhorse too have youPray what kind of a Hobby did you ride  MR WIL  My Hobby was a little Rosey boy with airy wings call'd Love led by a blind capricious guide call'd Fortune who from my cradle hath for ever thwarted me in my paths but now the bounteous Goddess has brought me to the fountain of sublunary bliss and crown'd me with the hand of this fair Lady

comes betwixt  A Saturday and Monday  For then I'm dress'd all in my best  To walk abroad with Sally  She is the darling of my heart  And she lives in our Alley  V  My master carries me to Church  And often am I blamed  Because I leave 'em in the lurch  As soon as text is named  I leave the Church in sermon time  And slink away to Sally  She is the darling of my heart  And she lives in our Alley  VI  When Christmas comes about again  Oh then I shall have money  I'll hoard it up and box and all  And give it to my honey  Ah wou'd it were ten thousand pounds  I'd give it to my Sally  She is the darling of my heart  And she lives in our Alley  VII  My Master and the neighbours all  Make game of me and Sally  And but for her I'd better be  A slave and row a galley  But when my seven long years are out  Oh then I'll marry Sally  Oh then we'll wed and then we'll bed  But not in our Alley  FINIS  A New Catalogue of Publications just Printed for ALEX HOGG At the King'sArms No PaternosterRow
