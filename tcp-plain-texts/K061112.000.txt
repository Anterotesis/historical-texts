REV BALL OF WINFRITH NEAR WEYMOUTH  DEAR SIR  WHEN I rambled into Dorsetshire in the summer of my only introduction to your acquaintance was your own frank affability and my sole recommendation to your hospitable roof that I was a stranger By your goodnatured politeness my mind was cheered in the solitudes of Lulworth and by your many friendly and kind offices I was furnished with information in a place where all was novelty  though my first charm there was the certainty of what I had supposed to be common in England a pious and benevolent clergyman and though I could previous to my visits at Winfrith boast the honour of having stood before the great gates of a bishop's palace yet for the comforts I there enjoyed in the little parlour of a country parsonagehouse accept this trifling testimony of wellremembered goodness to  DEAR SIR  Your highly honoured and much obliged servant J O'KEEFFE  BROMPTON  July  PROLOGUE  Written by  GEORGE COLMAN  Jun Esq Spoken by Mr  BARRYMORE  DREAD censors by whose nod we sink or rise  Be merry pray tonight and not too wise  Our bard will smile at the strict critic rule  He had his learning in a laughingschool  Order and ancient laws he dares neglect  And rather would be pleasant than correct  Nay spite of all grave classical communities  Wou'd sooner make you laugh than keep the unities  Mirth is his aimand critics we implore you  Relax while our light scenes we lay before you  Goodhumour to the countenance adds graces  Unbend the iron muscles of your faces  Lay acid wisdom by think mirth no sin  Throw your sour dignity asideand grin  Yet tho' we laugh we won'd not quit the grounds  Where sportive nature marks her ample bounds  Various her range calm gay then in the vapours  We  catch the goddess while she's cutting capers  To prove that we have caught her in the act  Our Hermitage is built upon  a fact  If then the drama's frolic pencil draws  A frolic factaway with critic laws  And grant the sketcher's fancy your applause  Oft has he drawn beforethis shop is full  With touches from his hand and none thought dull  Should this tonight seem vapid to your eyes  'Twould prove a  Dis  Agreeable Surprize  Oh think on his collection now in store  And smile on him on whom you smil'd before  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  WHIMMY  Mr SUETT  OLD PRANKS  Mr AICKIN  YOUNG PRANKS  Mr BANNISTER Jun  PEREGRINE  Mr EVATT  APATHY  Mr
