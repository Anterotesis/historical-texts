 LIBERAL OPINIONS UPON ANIMALS MAN AND PROVIDENCE  In which are introduced ANECDOTES OF A GENTLEMAN  Addressed to the Right Hon Lady CH***TH  FROM GAY TO GRAVE FROM LIVELY TO SEVERE  Pope  By COURTNEY MELMOTH  VOL II  LONDON Printed for G ROBINSON and J BEW in PaternosterRow and Sold by J WALTER CharingCross  MDCCLXXV  LIBERAL OPINIONS c  CHAP XXXII  THE ardour of your sentiments sir becomes your age and I am pleased with your compliment because I perceive it is the effervesence of a sincere heartI was going to say that ifbut we will proceed to our more familiar illustrationsImagine that when these children were five weeks old the mother of the poorest reduced to extreme necessity puts her infant  in a basket and lays it at the door of a person equally celebrated for wealth and benevolencethe gentleman takes it into his house clothes feeds and educates it as his own that very infant which with the  parent  would be the lout I have described would with its  protector  be as different a creature as could exist His pains passions pleasures and ideas totally  reversed  imagine likewise that some gypsey steals or kidnaps as it is called the rich child from the cradle and strolls with it up and down the country it will have its education in the open air its lodging in a barn and its dirty diet under a hedge Probably it will imbibe the craft and subtlety of the gypsey and limit its utmost  ambition to trick the traveller out of sixpence cross the palm with silver and tell the events which  have  happened or are still to be brought forward by the  line of life  Thus in every other instance with a few peculiar exceptions that have nothing to do with general rules  habit  and  education  form the mind and colour the human character  But how does this influence what we call virtue and vice said IVirtue and vice rejoin'd the gentleman are as dependent upon external as internal circumstances they are properties not more hereditary than adventitious and artificial nor do they issue more from the heart than from habitYou astonish me I repliedYou are now cried he at the period of human life  when curiosity is  often  caught in surprizes Experience will teach you to hear what now seems strange without emotion I have said nothing but what will too soon be intelligible  Pray go on sirpray go on  CHAP XXXIII  There are doubtlessresumed the gentleman some constitutions so adapted by nature to virtue that no troubles situations or temptations can subdue or extirpate their amiable propensitiesbut  ninetynine  times out of a  hundred  a character takes its bias and bearing from mere tuition and the line it is either led or  thrown into in the first stage of the human journey If there are  no  innate ideas sir it follows that the mind of every newborn babe is equally pure If there  are  those infantine seeds of the understanding and little embrios of intellectthey are easily turned into what channel the parent thinks proper so that I cannot but think the father of a family one of the most aweful charges upon earth  our parent's hand  Writes on our hearts the first faint characters  Which time retracing deepens into strength  After which  Nothing can efface them but death or heaven  Yet we behold said I many children unlike their parents both good and  bad It is admitted said Mr Greaves yet you will at the same time observe where the notions of parents and children are dissimilar the dissimilitude arises rather from difference of ages or improper culture than any thing else in general children are not liker in features than habits and I do assure you family  minds  are as often transmitted as family  faces  There is a tractability in youth which receives like snow every impressionand it is almost as difficult to erase the impression of one as the other nothing but heaven can effect itIf a son is trained up early to decency of manners and has the example of dignity living and moving before his eyes unless his temper is  particularly untoward he will turn out an elegant characterIf he is trained up in different principles he will act accordinglyThe Hoyden and the Prude amongst the other sex take not their tint of character one time in ten from nature but from a neglect early to give them a proper idea of deportment But yet said I very sedate women have romping runaway daughters and very prudent fathers have very perverse sonsI mean replied Mr Greaves to say no more than this that generally speaking men and women act and think as they are taught whilst they are only able to lisp out their meaningthat education will have some influence on the most abandoned and that upon the whole virtue and vice depend very essentially  on our primary sentiments and examples which whether good or ill will externally attend us in some measure through all possible transitions from the time we leave our cradles to the time we shall be deposited in our coffinsIf I have not wearied you we will  now  see how far habit influences our judgments in the great and important article of  reputation  CHAP XXXIV  I listen to you sir said I with joy and only lament that I am contributing to your fatigue at the time that I am receiving such a fund of entertainment  Habit my young friend said the gentleman operates with equal energy upon man and beast I could easily produce evidences of the fact by casting an eye upon the very horses now engaged in the dutiful drudgery of dragging us along and upon the herds and flocks which are grazing or sporting beside us but we will confine ourselves to our own species which are certainly the most interesting objects of speculation I was about to observe that Custom has much to do with our moral characters There are certain actions so naturally and palpably good or evil that neither sophistry nor slander nor address can either injure mend or mar them To question the light at noon day or the dark in the zenith  of the night would argue a malady beyond madness so in like manner to dispute whether downright wickedness  is  wickedness and evident excellence  is  excellence would be a lunacy in ethics so absurd that the poetical frenzy of poor Lee would be cool argument to iton the other hand my good sir if you live and mix long with mankind you will find many of your fellowcreatures pining away existence under the lashes the bleeding lashes of reproach merely because it is the  custom  to call one thing right and another wrong without tracing either to the bottom It is a maxim that the Vox Populi is the Vox Dei that as you know it is translated "what every body says must be true" I know nothing so deserving refutation  as a collection of those old saws and proverbs which acquiring force from antiquity and estimation from rustfor there are virtuosos in letters as well as in coinsare at length considered as utterly incontestible Now certain I am that upon an examination into those very maxims we put so much credit in some will turn out futile some disputable and many unfaithfulfor minute scrutinies we have not time it will be sufficient to look into  that  I have just mentioned and there is none more implicitly believed "What every body says must be true"I have myself seen many instances to disprove this but I shall beg your acceptance of one which is now uppermost in my memoryA young gentleman of my  particular acquaintance has for some time been deserted by his old companions and branded as a man of unsteady principles whose heart I know to abound with all those sensibilities which have hurried him as it were into the vortex of liberality till he is become an object of liberality himself He has those glowing feelings and sentiments which do at once honour and service to humannature notwithstanding which like poor Mr Blewitt whose history was recited by the grocer embarrassments have beset him and the world sets him down an  undone  man The world gets hold of a prejudice and then it is called Vox Dei The Vox Populi is given as the sentiment of  everybody  and thus many reputations are mistaken and misrepresented which deserve a better fate  There are various persons likewise now particularly reprobated for a few indelicate concessions to which necessity may in violence of their better judgments have constrained them to yield who had they possessed happier circumstances would have made a much more respectable figure than those which now mark them with insamy Many an unfortunate female too at this time wandering up and down the streetsmany an insulted and deserving characterBut I am rambling too miscellaneouslyI feel myself a little wearyHeigho  Here the gentleman stoped abruptly His countenance became suddenly cloudedhis lip quiveredhis eye remained fixed and clasping his hands forcibly together he at length burst  into tearsAfter he a little recovered himselfhe caught me hold by the arm and exclaimedOh sirmy daughter my daughtermy Almeria  CHAP XXXV  I am now composed my young friend the idea of a domestic misfortune obtruded itself upon me and I could not help feeling the stroke of humanityof nature and a fatherHeaven cried Iyou distract me I was about to take notice replied Mr Greavesof  one  cruelty in the Vox Populi which is certainly against every notion of the Vox Dei 'Tis the custom sir to abandon the weakest part of our species for  that  ruin which  the artifices of our sex have perpetrated nor can any future repentence remove the sense of their error or restore them to the bosoms of more fortunate women  They set like stars to rise no more  I had a wife sir with whom I have mourned many yearsthough I buried her but six weeks agoShe died of a broken heart and there was I assure youa woe in the family big enough to break itAbout eleven years ago sir an only child was taken from meI was robbed of her by a man whom I held the nearest to my heartand for five years it has been my incessant business to recover my darling but in vain My wife fell into a deep and rapid consumption  and I was obliged to reside with her in the countryShe grew worse and weaker every hourbut two days before she resigned her last breathwe received by a special messenger a packethow shall I speak itfrom from my belovedmisguidedrepenting wandererThe poor thing had the better to persuade thrown the pathetic parts of her story into poetry But that which delighted me more far morethan all the restand which would have more magic for a parent's heart than the poetry of a Milton was an attested account from a man of reputation that my child was actually at last under the protection of that noble institution which offers an asylum to insulted penitenceIn the first transport I could not conceal the  news from my wife but she had only power to press the paper trembling to her bosom and feebly lifted up her eyes to heaventhe restyou must spare me sir upon the tender subject she is deadshe is in heaven  The poor gentleman covered his face in his hankerchief and I have no words to describe my own feelings  CHAP XXXVI  When Mr Greaves could again lift up his headhe told me that having trusted to the ground the remains of his wife he was now going to visit his longlost daughter who was in he stoptand I was unwilling to enlarge upon the subject though I  desired most ardently to see the poetry he spoke ofBut for the present we dropt the matter and a profound silence ensued till we again changed horses At last however Mr Greaves perceiving my anxiety and guessing the cause put his hand into his pocket and produced a small bundle of papers fastened by a piece of red tapefrom these he took a manuscript of which he thus declared his intentions as he held it in his hand  Here it ishere is that unhappy girlmy poor Almeria's petition read it young gentlemanread it and pity the daughterand the father If it should particularly strike you take a copy and if you continue long in London perhaps you may see it in printIf you should not and you  should chance to survive me as it is most probable you willpublish it and at the same time publish with it this  Letter of Gratitude  there are reasons whyI would not chuse being but too much interested in the contents to appear in the businesstake it therefore and give it to the world at your best leisureThere sirit were improper to suppress itperhaps it may fall into the hands of the young and dissipatedperhaps it may find its way into the closets of the chaste and beautifulThe libertine may snatch it up in the intervals of his gay career and the parent afflicted by the loss of  his  child may be induced to read it from affection and curiosityIn all or in any of these cases it will afford some salutary reflections  and the heart the conscience and the understanding will point them out immediatelyHe put the paper into my handI reminded him of the pleasing prospect of seeing his restored daughterHe did not seem insensible of my wishes to dissipate his melancholy but said nothingAs I knew it must be some time before he could collect himself and perceiving he began to close his eyes as if he desired silence I left him to his reflecions which it would have been impertinent to interrupt after the hint he had given me and began to open my papers which melted me so many times into tears during the perusal that I was heartily glad the poor gentleman  affected  slumberAs I have now had the performance so long by  me I shall set it down in my journal in this place where though it somewhat interferes with my further connection with Mr Greaves it properly belongs because I would not disjoint the subject from the sentiments which introduced it to my knowledgeSo that if ever my history is found the history of this unhappy lady will be found with it and in so publishing an age they can fall into few hands which will not send them to the press  CHAP XXXVII  The  Letter of Gratitude  directly follows and was I believe designed as a short dedication to the work It was written by the father  TO THE REVEREND ** ** **  SIR  To whom should the penitent daughter address the sentiments of reformation but to him who has had the greatest share in promoting it To whom should the father who hence derives the felicity of his last moments pay the tribute of gratitude but to that fountain from whence he traces his blessings to their source The restored ALMERIA sir attributes to the force of your arguments and to the tenderness of your admonitions much of that abhorrence for vice and dignity of amendment that now inspire  her There are hundreds of daughters no doubt under the same obligation and hundreds of fathers whose prayers and tears repay you for it For thisI had almost said heavenly eloquence may you long be distinguished and may you bestow thereby upon many other parents now mourning for their children the serenity and the hope which has been conferred upon  THE FATHER OF ALMERIA  CHAP XXXVIII  ALMERIA OR THE PENITENT  Being a Genuine Epistle from an Unfortunate Daughter in to her Family in the Country  WITHDRAWN from all temptations that entice  The frauds of fashion and the snares of vice  From all that can inspire unchaste delight  To my dearbleeding family I write  But oh my pen the tender task denies  And all the daughter rushes to my eyes  Oft as the paper to my hand I brought  My hand still trembl'd at the shock of thought  Sighs interrupt the story of my woe  My blushes burn me and my tears overflow  But nature now insists upon her claim  Strikes the fine nerve and gives me up to shame  No more the anxious wish can I restrain  Silent no longer can your child remain  Write write I must each hope each fear declare  And try once more to win a father's care  Scorn not ah scorn not then the mournful verse  Revive my blessing and recall my curse  Give to a daughter's wrongs one parentsigh  Nor let a mother my  last  prayer deny  Yet where oh where shall I the tale begin  And where conclude the narrative of sin  How each dire circumstance of guilt disclose  Unload my breast and open all its woes  How to an injured parent shall I tell  The arts by which I stray'd by which I fell  No common language can the scenes express  Where every line should mark extreme distress  Mere human words unequal all we find  To paint the feelings of a wounded mind  'Tis not the scribbler's vein the songster's art  Nor the wild genius of a vacant heart  'Tis not the lines that musically flow  To mark the poet's wellimagin'd woe  Nor all the frolicks of the tuneful tribe  Can such a mighty grief as  mine  describe  Full oft has scorpion FANCY to my view  Imag'd each anguish that a parent knew  At midnight's still and searching hour she came  Glar'd round my bed and chill'd my soul with shame  Crouded each black idea in my sight  And gloom'd a chaos on the balmy night  "Beholdshe saidon the damp bed of earth  Behold th' unhappy man who gave thee birth  In dust he rolls his sorrowsilver'dhair  And on each muscle sits intense despair  See how the passions vary in his face  Tear his old frame and testify disgrace  Retir'd from home in silence to complain  To the pale moon the veteran tells his pain  Now sinks oppress'd now sudden starts away  Abhors the night yet sickens at the day  And see thou guilty daughter see and mourn  The whelming grief that waits the fire's return  Beneath some black'ning yew's sepulchral gloom  Where pensive Sorrow seems to court the tomb  Where tenfold shades repel the light of day  And ghostly footsteps seem to press the way  Bent to the ground by mis'ry and by years  There view thy bleeding mother bath'd in tears  Her look disorder'd and her air all wild  She beats the breast that fed a worthless child  And oh she cries  Oh had the fostering milk to poison turn'd  Some ague shiver'd or some fever burn'd  Had death befriended on the fatal morn  In which these eyes beheld a daughter born  Or had th' ETERNAL seal'd its eyes in night  Ere it the barrier knew 'twixt wrong and right  Then had these curses ne'er assail'd my head  Why spring such torments from a lawful bed  Now melted soften'd gentler she complains  Rage ebbs away the tide of love remains  Then how th' affecting tears each other trace  Down the dear furrows of her matron face  But still the anxious mother brings to light  Scenes of past joy and innocent delight  Calls to remembrance each  infantine  bliss  The cradle's rapture and the baby's kiss  Each throbbing hope that caught th' embrace sincere  With ev'ry joy that rose in ev'ry tear  The beauteous prospect brightning every day  The father's sondling and the mother's play  Yet soon she finds again the sad reverse  Till harrass'd nature sinks beneath its curse  Again more fiercemore mad she rends her frame  And loudly brands Almeria with her shame"  Here paus'd and shrunk the VISION from my view  But  Conscience  colour'd as the shade withdrew  Pierc'd to the heart in agony I lay  And all confusion rose with rising day  But ah what hope could morning bring to me  What but the mournful privilege to  see  To view the pleasures which I could not share  And waste the day in solitude and care  More clearly shone the sun on my disgrace  And mark'd  more plain  the blushes on my face  Then all enrag'd I curs'd the abandon'd hour  When honour yielded to the traitor's pow'r  When rash I scorn'd the angel voice of truth  In all the mad simplicity of youth  When from a father's arms forlorn I stray'd  And left a mother's tenderness unpaid  While nature duty precept all combin'd  To fix obedience on the plastic mind  Stung at the thought each vengeance I design'd  And weary'd heav'n to desecrate mankind  From room to room distractedly I ran  The scorn of woman and the dupe of man  Alcanor curst Alcanor first I sought  And as I past a fatal dagger caught  The smiling villain soon my Fury found  Struck at his heart and triumph'd in the wound  "A rain'd womangivesI cried the stroke"  He reel'd he sell he fainted as I spoke  But soon as human  blood  began to flow  Soon as it gush'd obedient to the blow  Soon as the ruddy stream his cheek forsook  And death sat struggling in the dying look  Love and  the woman  all at once return'd  I felt his anguish and my rashness mourn'd  O'er his pale form I heav'd the bursting sigh  And watch'd the changes of his fading eye  To stop the crimson tide my hair I tore  Kiss'd the deep gash and wash'd with tears the gore  'Twas love'twas pitycall it what you will  Where the heart feelswe  all  are women still  But low I bend my knees to pitying heav'n  For his recovery to my prayers was giv'n  He liv'dto all the rest I was refign'd  And murder rack'd no more my tortur'd mind  He liv'dbut soon with mean perfidious stealth  Forsook his prey and rioted in wealth  Yet think not now arriv'd the days of joy  Alcanor flatter'd only to destroy  Alike to blast my body and my mind  He robb'd me first then left me to mankind  Soon from his Janus face the mask he tore  The charm was broke and magic was no more  The dreadful cheat awhile to  hide  he strove  By poor pretences of a partial love  Awhile  disguis'd  the surfeits of his heart  And top'd full well the warm admirer's part  Till tir'd at last with labouring to conceal  And feigning transports which he did not feel  He turn'd at once so civilly polite  Whate'er I said indifference made  so right  Such coldness mark'd his manners and his mien  My guiltmy ruinat a glance was seen  In vain I now assum'd a chaster part  In vain I struggl'd with a broken heart  In vain I try'd to purify my stain  Correct my life and rise reform'd again  Pleas'd at the hope from savage man I flew  And sought protection from each friend I knew  Each friend at my approach shrunk back with dread  And bade me hide my pestilential head  Ev'n for the meanest servitude I sought  But nice suspicion at my figure caught  My dress too flaunting or my air too free  And deep reserve betok'ning mystery  Some frailty rais'd a doubt where'er I came  And every question flush'd my cheeks with shame  Conscious of guilt overshadow'd by pretence  'Twas hard to act the  farce  of innocence  Oft as I beg'd the servant's lowest place  The  treach'rous  colour shifted in my face  The fatal secret glow'd in every look  Trembling I stood and stammering I spoke  Next came the views of home into my mind  With each dear comfort I had left behind  Pardon and pleasure started to my thought  While Hope inspir'd forgiveness of my fault  But soon too soon the sweet ideas sled  And left mebegging at each door for bread  Yet poor indeed was this support to me  Ah had I starv'd on common charity  Far other woes and insults were in store  My fame was lost and I could rise no more  Driv'n to the dreadful precipice of sin  My brain swam round the gulph and hurl'd me in  And now no pen could picture my distress  'Twas more much more than simple wretchedness  Famine and guilt and conscience tore my heart  And urg'd me to pursue the wanton's part  Take then the truth and learn at once my shame  Such my hard fateI welcom'd all that came  But oh no transport mingled in my stains  No guilty pleasure ever sooth'd my pains  No vicious hope indelicately gay  Nor warmer passions lull'd my cares away  The flatt'ring compliment fatigu'd my ear  While halfafraid I halfconceal'd a tear  Whole nights I pass'd insensible of bliss  Lost to the loath'd embrace and odious kiss  Nor wine nor mirth the aching heart could fire  Nor could the sprightly music ought inspire  Alive to each reflection that oppress'd  The more I gain'd the more I was distress'd  Ev'n in the moment of unblest desire  Oft would the wretch complain I wanted fire  Cold as a statue in his arms I lay  Wept though the night and blush'd along the day  Ah think what terrors e'er could equal mine  Ah think and pityfor I once was thine  The sweet society of friends was o'er  For happier women dare invite no more  And they at noon would meet me with alarms  Who stole at midnight to my venal arms  My own companions no sweet comfort brought  A shameful sett incapable of thought  Their wanton passions ne'er could touch my heart  For all was looseness infamy and art  No modest maxims suited to improve  No soft sensations of a chaster love  No gen'rous prospects of a soul refin'd  No worthy lessons of a noble mind  E'er touch'd their bosoms hardened to their state  Charm'd at their arts and glorying in their fate  Some stroke of frolic was their constant theme  The dreadful oath and blasphemy extreme  Th' affected laugh the ruderetorted lye  Th' indecent question and the bold reply  Even in their dress their business I could trace  And broad was stampt the Harlot on each face  O'er every part the shameful trade we spy  The step audacious and the rolling eye  The smile insidious the look obscene  The air enticing and the mincing mein  With these alas a sacrifice I liv'd  With these the wages of disgrace receiv'd  But heav'n at length its vengeance to complete  Drove medistemper'dto the public street  For on a time when lightning fir'd the air  And laid the sable breast of midnight bare  When rain and wind assail'd th' unshelter'd head  That sought in vainthe blessing of a bed  Distress'ddiseas'dI crawl'd to ev'ry door  And beg'd with tears a shelter for the poor  My knees at length unable to sustain  The force of hunger and the weight of rain  Fainting I fell then stagg'ring rose again  And wept and sigh'd and hop'd and rav'd in vain  Then nor tell then o'erwhelm'd by sore distress  To my own hand I look'd for full redress  All things were aptno flatterer to beguile  'Twas night'twas darkoccasion seem'd to smile  Where'er I turn'd destruction rose to view  And on reflection rising frenzy grew  From foolish love the knife conceal'd I wore  That in my rage Alcanor's bosom tore  Thought press'd on thoughtth' unsettled senses flew  As from my breast the fatal blade I drew  Still the stain'd point with crimson spots was dy'd  cry'd  "And this is well'tis blood for blood" I  Then did I poise the instrument in air  Bent to the stroke and laid my bosom bare  But ah my crimes that instant rose to view  Disarm'd my purposemy resolves o'erthrew  Fear shook my hand I flung the weapon by  Unfit to  live  I was not fit to  die    Ah wretch'd woman she who strays for bread  And sells the sacred pleasures of the bed  Condemn'd to shifts her reason must despise  The scorn and pity of the good and wise  Condemn'd each call of passion to obey  And in despite of nature to be gay  To force a simper with a throbbing heart  And call to aid the feeble helps of art  Oblig'd to suffer each impure caress  The slave of fancy and the drudge of dress  Compell'd to suit her temper to each taste  Scorn'd if too wanton hated if too chaste  Forc'd with the public whimsy to comply  As veers the gale of modern luxury  And oft th' afflicted creature must sustain  Strokes more severe yet tremble to complain  The felon bawd a dreadful beast of prey  Rules o'er her subjects with despotic sway  Trucks for the human form with fatal pow'r  And bargains for her beauties by the hour  But should some female in her dang'rous train  Attend the altar of her shame with pain  Dispute at length the monster's base controul  And dare assert the scruples of her soul  Should she reluctant yield to the disgrace  And shew the signs of sorrow in her face  Th' imperious abbess frowns her into vice  And hates the sinner that grows overnice  But hear yet hear your hapless daughter's plea  Some little pity still is due to me  If to have felt each agony of mind  To bear the stings which Conscience leaves behind  If at each morn to shudder at the light  Dread the fair day and fear the coming night  If like the thief of ev'ry eye afraid  Anxious I sought the blushconcealing shade  If my sad bosom bursting with its weight  Bled and bewail'd the hardships of my fate  If to have known no joys and known all pains  Can aught avail to purge my former stains  Judge not your childyour supplianttoo severe  But veil her frailties and bestow a tear  Yet has Almeria  now  a juster claim  To seal her pardon and to close her shame  Each early tresspass nobler to remove  And hope again the sanction of your love  THESE holy mansions sacred to our woes  To screen from scorn and hide us from our foes  Gradual the fallen woman to retrieve  Reform the manners and the mind relieve  From barbarous man to shield his hapless prey  Expunge the spot and chace the blush away  To sooth each sorrow by the pow'r of pray'r  And half supply a parent's pious care  To lull the fluttering pulses to repose  Each pang to soften and each wish compose  Wean us from scenes that fatally misguide  And teach the breast to glow with nobler pride  These holy mansions have receiv'd your child  And here she mourns each passion that beguil'd  Thrice has the sun his annual beams bestow'd  And found me here determin'dto be  good  Already feels my heart a lighter grief  And each white minute brings me fresh relief  Or if by chance my sorrows I renew  Half claim my crimes and half belong to you  Here then for ever secret and resign'd  Here for its GOD will I prepare my mind  Here pass conceal'd my penitential days  And lead a life of piety and praise  Come then thou lovely patroness of fame  Thou bright restorer of a ruin'd name  Come fair REPENTANCE o'er each thought preside  Patient I follow such a heav'nly guide  To all thy laws implicitly I bend  And call thee sister saviour genius friend  Oh let me breathe the solemn vow sincere  Oh let Religion consecrate each tear  Then should long life be mercifully giv'n  The soul repair'd may dare to think of heav'n  Then cleans'd from every dark and Ethiop stain  VIRTUE that dove of peace shall come again  With smoothest wings resettle on my breast  And open prospects of eternal rest  And yet before that golden hour arrive  Oh would my injur'd relatives forgive  Oh could they see this happier turn of fate  And view their Magdalen's far chaster state  Then would they fondly close her fading eye  Bless her last breath and bid her peaceful die  Deep in her ward's most venerable gloom  Late was a contrite sister from her room  Where long the blushing pious vot'ress lay  And sought a shelter from the shame of day  In words halfsmother'd by the heaving sigh  And voice that spoke despairthus heard to cry  "Oh injur'd CHASTITY thou heavenly dame  Thou spotless guardian of the cherub Fame  Who arm'st fair Virtue 'gainst th' insulting foe  And in her cheeks commands the rose to blow  Thou whose resistless shield protects the fair  Who falls not willing in the traitor's snate  Had I oh had I still thy rules obey'd  Despis'd the treach'rous town and walk'd the shade  Had I each villain stratagem defy'd  And scorn'd the flatt'rer with a decent pride  Had I withstood his arrows at my heart  Oppos'd cach trick and baffled ev'ry art  Then lib'ral truth might ev'ry hour employ  Each thought be rapture and each hope be joy  Then lov'd rever'd as mother and as wife  Blest had I been in the  pure  vale of life  Haply my EdwardOh lamented name  Once my high boast before I plung'd in shame  Haply my Edward yielding to my charms  Oh my smote bosom whence these new alarms  Why spring the conscious drops into my eye  Why feels my heart the loveimpassion'd sigh  I dare not speak my promis'd happiness  Yet Edward couldst thou witness my distress  Witness the firm unviolated mind  Seduc'd by vice but not to vice inclin'd  Could thou behold the constantfalling tear  My pray'rs attest my selfreproaches hear  Ah couldst thou think how deeply I bewail  How thick enshrowd me in the friendly veil  How in the sacred solitude of night  The care of heav'n unceasing I invite  Breathe the warm wish and pour the fervent prayer  Now dare to hope and now expect despair  Couldst thou but see these changes of my grief  Surely thy pity would bestow relief  My Edward's virtue for I know his heart  The balms of soft compassion would impart  His breast would mitigate each stern decree  And judgment yield to mercy's milder plea  But he is lostfond wretch thy plaint give o'er  The dear the injur'd Edward is no more  Or if he liveshe recollects thy shame  Scorns thy false vows and hates th' unworthy flame"  Scarce had the pensive child of sorrow spoke  When from a neighbouring ward these accents broke  "'Tis she'tis sheth' unfortunate is found  My pulse beats quickAh save me from the ground  Support mehelp mesome assistance lend  And my faint footsteps to the mourner bend  She livesshe lives"The unhappy woman heard  Shook in each nerve and trembled at each word  Then swooning sunk at length upon the floor  Just as th' afflicted stranger reach'd the door  Tottering he enter'dcaught th' afflicted fair  And rais'd her flutt'ring frame with tend'rest care  "Ah drooping lily rise to life and me  And in this faded form thy Edward see  Recall the lustre in thy sparkling eye  And bid for ever all thy sorrows fly  Long have I sought thee with a lover's zeal  For thee alone I weep for thee I feel  Come then fair penitent forget each woe  And ev'ry pleasure ev'ry transport know  Lost be the mem'ry of thy former stain  Thy pow'rful pray'rs have wash'd thee white again  Bury'd be ev'ry anguish in this kiss  Wake then oh wake to virtue and to bliss"  This said he press'd her in a soft embrace  And the warm blood came flushing to her face  Now pale retir'd now ran a deeper red  Till cheer'd at last the sweet disorder fled  A thousand tender questions now succeed  They smile alternate and alternate bleed  Edward the chaplain's long try'd friend had been  And hence arose the late propitious scene  The sacred chaplain gave her to his care  Join'd their kind fates and left them with a pray'r  CHAP XXXIX  Before I proceed to set down other matters which fell out to chequer the adventures of my journey I cannot but observe that about two years after this period I met Mr Greaves in the Park with a beautiful young creature under his arm and some time afterwards I paid him a visit when he took me cordially by the hand and spoke to me as follows  My dear BENIGNUS where have you been buried since our last interview When I told you upon the road the occasion of that melancholy you detected through my efforts to conceal it you may remember I told you the motive of my journey Upon my arrival  in London and taking leave of you I call'd an hackney coach and drove directly to ***In one word I found my  daughter  I felt the fainting penitent in my arms I received of her with an anxiety of joya tremor transportOh BENIGNUS think for mecolour the scene in the paint of youthful ardourdo justice to nature and  imagine  the delicacies which were never  spoken  You have seen my daughterI never walk without her and yet sir all this joy is dashed with an ingredient of sorrow The prudes untouched by the pathos of her penitence carry an air of ceremonious civility towards my childThe faded virgins who have never passed the fiery trial of temptation and a set of haughty matrons who have every  other vice that disgraces the sex but that of which even nature  predetermined  they should never be guilty treat my Almeria with a coy and insulting reserve which goes too near her heartan heart BENIGNUS generous and gentle as  Here our discourse was interrupted by ALMERIA herself who came to inform us the chocolate waited for us in the little saloon  Grace was in all her steps  In every action dignity and love  Her own epistle has so pathetically described the misery of her situation that she has not left room for any thing but pityAnd yet who that considers such a creature has been as it were  public property  that reflects  how many are at this very moment chained down to a necessity equally sore many of them exposed to the want of that daily bread which even nightly impurity cannot supply some of them beating through the streets by the barbarity of their betrayersome hunted from one hiding place to another by the vigilance of the bailiff and all of them liable to contempt indignity and distemperwho I say that collects together these facts in his mind can be content with expressing barren compassionWho can forbear mixing relief with their tears and blessing the benevolence which first suggested and still continues their  Asylum    I have a little violated chronology by placing these transactions somewhat  out of the order of time but as my history is written at a venture and may never visit the world I have been less cautious of observing critical rules However as I by no means design to make a book of digressions I shall now turn back to Mr Greaves who having sat with his eyes closed was when he opened them again much more fitted for society There are in truth certain moments when the music of the  spheres  would be discordant and when the condolence of our dearest acquaintances is an unwelcome interruption The human soul settles on her darling subject descends into herself and indulges in a luxury which bee like extracts honey from the poison of calamity In one of these dispositions was Mr Greaves  when he counterfeited repose he had now reconciled himself to the events he had contemplated for he was both a philosopher and a christian and with an affability peculiar to wellbred people begged my pardon for his reveries  CHAP XL  We were now just stepping into our last stage but one and though the glories of the sun were over his departing beams were extremely agreeable Mr Greaves resumed a look of complacency and I being willing to keep as clear of the only subject that could perhaps again discompose it asked what sort of sensations were created  in his mind by the story of Mr Blewitt Though his history was related answered my companion in unpolished language it contains a folio of valuable facts But what a pity it is repeated I that such mercenary hearts as are lodged in the bosoms of the Quaker and Grocer should be in general more undisturbed through life than such as guided the feelings of the generous Mr Blewitt Alas returned the gentleman you are yet an infant in terrestial events I dare swear you have an excellent heart and I am sure a good understanding yet you know but little of lifeYou profess to be travelling in pursuit of  happiness  and to dedicate your fortune to the service of society From hence I should conclude that you are  flying from  misery  I related my adventures at the village He said if I could not find Contentment in the shade it was doubtful whether I should meet her in the city But I fear continued he you expect from the world more than it can bestow you have perhaps placed the standard of felicity too high or your ideas of it are probably a little romantic  All I want upon earth replied I is comprized in three things friendship fidelity and gratitudeAt your age resumed Mr Greaves smiling I entered the world animated by the same hopes and fascinated by the same notions My headmy hands and my heart were busy to derive a reflected blessing to  myself  by having promoted the blessedness of  others  To  this end I continued in the world till that agonizing accident I have already related  At this crisis our chaise having just ascended a hill arrived at a very beautiful spot indeed It was an eminence that topt an extensive prospect and commanded the scene below which was composed of  intermingled  towers and spires woods and waters the verdure of fields and the variegation of valliesI could not help ejaculating with some energyIs it not strange that a world like this so fitted for the reception and happiness of every being which inhabits it with such noble capacities of pleasure adapted to each should nevertheless be the seat of general torment and fretfulness disaster and distressIs it not strange thatthat  The gentleman took hold of my wrist and fixing his eyes very seriously upon me spoke in a tone of unusual dignity  CHAP XLI  Never allow amazement to hurry you into expressions unbecoming the character of a christian nor let either the insults or miseries you see or feel in the world make you charge Heaven with the shadow of injustice Take my word for it God is not nor ever was in faultYou see before you this moment enough to convince you that he has done every thing on his partthe sun warms us the moon in his absence sets off the  face of the earth in a sort of shady majestythe rain descends to bless usthe ground feeds and entertains us and the ample intentions of universal nature are universally kind and beneficent MAN has perverted the systemthe invention of coins the passion for negotiation and the love of barter have extended an ambition of the lowest kind amongst all classes of people The motive of commerce is no longer rational and business which was originally designed to promote health and circulate interchanged conveniencies is now for the most part avariciously carried on to swell the coffers of the individual by impoverishing the species nay the mercenary spirit of the times extends to nations and climates divided by the remotest part of the  ocean But if you please we will trace this evil  ab origine  The Almighty created a world then peopled it and afterwards found that it was  good  The management of it was put into the hands of mannot however to be too minute let us take notice that every thing was once indiscriminately enjoyed The earth was a common property and it was fertile without labourthe error of our first parents considerably changed the system and tillage and druggery became necessary to subdue a soil that no longer produced plenty spontaneously No absolute right however or proprietorship was yet ascertained and every one fixed on and cultivated the spot he chose this  miscellaneous  participation soon created disorder for as  the bad passions were now let loose upon the world indolence seized upon the comforts which had been acquired by industry and hence sprang domestic contest and civil dispute and half mankind were at war Those that obtained the victory held the conquered as his slave and from hence originated those distinctions which obtained by rapacity and kept by force were after sanctified by political institutions for upon this finding men were to be restrained from violence and invasion only by compulsion terror and authority the laws came in to the assistance of the  stronger  party the difference betwixt meum and tuum was soon understood and every individual maintained himself upon that which was now secured  to him by certain compacts to violate which was henceforth to be considered as a punishable crime By this time an idea of property became sacred and general and by these means the civilized part of the earth was said to belong not as formerly to all alike but to a third part of its inhabitants Subordination therefore of necessity took place The pride of power gained ground every day and one human creature usurped dominion over another because the distinction was now known betwixt master and servant From master and servant rose notions of great privileges and poverty dropt submissive at the knee of riches Pastorals and Arcadia were no more Instead of every man dressing the glebe and turning up the soil  in  common  such as had now dominion over the acres insisted upon having the essential drudgery they required performed by those whose fathers might probably  possess  the spot upon which they were to  toil    CHAP XLII  Affairs once settled on these partial principles resisted every effort of revocationfor who that could eat his bread without sweating his brow would give up the advantages he had gained Centuries are now behind us since things were thus regulated and every year hath given force and venerableness to the establishment Every  man has given up the point and makes the most of his situation the clown rises early to the task of cultivation and the master looks indolently on and receives the profit Luxury was introduced under these auspices the beverage of the fieldthe sallad of the brook and the water of the springwith the homely apparel that decently veil'd and warmed the body were rejected and Voluptuousness turned Simplicity blushing away The moment in which man became possest of more than was necessary to the wholesome purposes of life the moment in which his industry became nerveless and his love of labour to slacken pride soon taught leisure to misuse abundance and the passions to wanton with authorityHence  some revelled in the riots of dissipation others found a pleasure in accumulation and some better spirits had a bliss in distribution At length through the natural chain of consequences we are arrived at the  crisis  We are polished populated and resined in the extreme Distinctions are so minute property so tenacious splendor so superior and trade so jealous that no distresses you observe should surprise you Money hath acquired a universal ascendency property hath "subdued all things under her feet" and luxury sickens in despair because novelty is wanting to give an edge to the blunted appetites Had the use of a metalcurrency been restricted by any reasonable rule of  moderation  it might have settled the system upon  a noble principle for it is equally convenient to the great purposes of benevolence and business But the lucky and fortunate have run into two extremes so egregiously absurd that the one opens upon us a fountain of  poisoned pleasures  and the other a source of  sordid maxims  The passion for wasting on the one hand and of hoarding on the other have not only involved the world in confusion and thrown the passions into an uproar but have actually left almost one  half  of the human species naked and starved to cloath and accommodate the  other  CHAP XLIII  You have discovered to me Mr Greaves said I a train of observations of which I had no ideabut you are preparing to speakand I would not interrupt you for the universe  The observations I have made continued Mr Greaves have been no doubt made and much more sagaciously by many others for contemplation philosophy and science have now gone very far our discoveries in letters and in lands may perhaps have been pretty equal There may be yet unknown tracks in speculation the intellect may still abound with new reserves of wisdom There is still it is  presumed a  terra incognita  there may be still an undug mine of  knowledge  To explore this must be the labour of some literary ColumbusI pretend not to such skill and indeed can only assure you that I offer you frankly on this subject the unadorned facts which I have collected from early readings and practical observations You run your eye hastily over the  world  and then complain that it abounds with misery After what has been said should you not be surprised to find a great deal of happiness and yet distributed up and down the various parts of it there really is a very considerable share That the infelicity grows out of all proportion still  more  considerable cannot easily be determinedfor  though the fate of thousands can only be made supportable by the chearful expectation of a  better  and though the human heart is in general blinded by temporal prejudices yet coarse as the mass of gratifications are that  endear  life to the multitude they are nevertheless gratifications and receive attachment from custom The joys of more delicate minds are indeed less extended and lie in a small compass being confined to the little circle of the few whose feelings are softened by nature and refined by art But were the agonies of existence still greater and acuter than they  are  the DEITY is not the author of ithe made the worldsurvey it sir even through the shadings of the evening and tell me if it is not worthy of a divine  artificer He made man to inhabit it has he not bestowed amiable and ample faculties upon himfitted him equally to enjoy society and solitude given him a power to derive a pleasure from the freshness of the gale or from the convivial glasshas not he bestowed upon him eyes to  see  missortune an heart to  feel  it and arms to  remove  it Has he not implanted in the mind a sympathy between the sexes so attractive that by a kind of magnetic power we are irresistibly drawn to each other that life may be perpetuated while love is unpolluted Has he not given us early ideas of more disinterested attachments and inspired us with dispositions to philanthropy and friendship has he not seated in the bosom a monitor to compliment  us for every thing that is becoming and accommodated the taste with endless varietyis not the ear enchanted by the harmonies of natureand the smell gratified with perfume and to crown the whole has he not placed certain intimations in the soul which assure it that  however  agreeable the Deity may have rendered the present slate it is but a passage and upon the easy terms of our acting properly to  him  and each  other  will lead us gently along till it terminates in  eternity  CHAP XLIV  This my young friend is a saint sketch of the works and intentions of the Deitythat those works and intentions are abused can never be imputed to their allkind Author but to  man  If the beauties and benefits of nature are perverted if the faculties of the mind and body are obstinately bent to actions evidently contradictory to the purposes for which they were given if love and friendship are overborne by their opposite passions and ifas has been before hinted  interest  carries away the palm from earth and heavenwho but man  is chargeable with the consequences of this general inversion of blessings  The fact is indisputable sir said I I tremble and I adore but as Mr Blewitt seemed always to perform the purposes for which he was born a man how is it that he and others like him should not pass smoothly through the sea of life Because said the gentlemanto carry on the metaphorwhen the storm is violent and the hurricane extreme it is certain the good and bad sailors will be wrecked alike Is not that  strange  said I"Shall gravitation stop as you go by replied Mr Greavesno sir The chain of causes and consequences is irrefragablethat innocence should suffer in a world of guilt is morally  inevitable but depend upon it the suffering will not be  ultimately  in vain  As to Mr Blewitt I compassionate and admire him but he is one of those characters whose amiable weaknesses expose him to almost  certain poverty  The poor man was kind to a fault the world would call him a goodnatured foolIndeed he was wrong sir to indulge the tenderness of his feeling in the extreme though this cannot be owned without its implying at the same time a very cutting satire against the depravity of human nature a depravity I have all along taken notice of as the source of so much disaster and calamity  Mr Blewitt did not reflect that as money is the property by  which every passion is gratified man will naturally idolize it as the golden calf and that to adopt a few saving maxims in relation to keeping a part of such property always at command would be favourable even to his  generosity  because it must needs be a deep misfortune to find the hand accustomed to liberallity compelled to contract when it can give no more In a country where  appearances  of wealth can claim veneration where money acquires the chymic quality of turning every thing it approximates into gold and where that gold is moreover able to array insamy in the robe of integrity and lead the judgments of the wisest blindfold as it pleasesIn such a country every  apparent want  of this property  will be liable to neglect and ill treatmentand every degree of indigence will meet desertion for this plain reason because indigence has nothing either to procure or excite the idea of authority nor to observe those rules which externally distinguish the master from the servant You will say perhaps all this sort of distinction is ridiculous No doubt of it but as more than fifty out of sixty have adopted such distinctionsas they are actually the general standards of conductas they are also  more  than two thousand years oldit is in vain to dispute their proprietyone might as well dispute the customs of a country tell the Indian it is indecent to go naked or that a Toledo dangling by the side of the Spanish peasant must  be extremely inconvenient Oeconomy therefore is now almost the only security from contempt and though it were too narrow a line to tread in the track of the grocer as  no  real joy could arise from such a rigid policy neither to lend sixpence nor borrow sixpence yet I and I think my heart not an unfeeling one have always found it sound prudence to keep a friend in my  pocket  and on no terms to lie at the mercy and compassion of another  CHAP XLV  It was now night and we were in the middle of Finchley Common The driver bid us secure part of our money if we had any great quantity about us for that he saw a fellow lurking by the side of the road at a little distanceIn five seconds we were up with the man who was groaning piteously upon a grassy hillock Mr Greaves who knew the arts of his own species suspected this to be an imposition and opposed my desire to have him lifted into the chaise But these ideas were presently removed for the stranger got up and coming to the window presented  not a pistol buta  purse  The chaise stopt  Half an hour ago gentlemensaid the mana horseman came by me and I was tempted to supply the wants of a large family to demand his moneyHe put into my hand this purseI conjure you gentlemen if by any stroke of happy chance he should be any part of your company take it and return it to him just as I received itIt is my first violation of the laws either of hospitality or my countryI might possibly return home undiscovered but I  feel  that I cannot bear it My conscience is victorious even over my necessities If you should not know the traveller I have plunderedit is still in your power to do my bleeding soul some  serviceUpon your arrival in London advertise the circumstances of the robberytake the property and redeliver it upon the first application This I cannot do for myself without throwing myself into the arms of justice and the situation of a wife whom I doat on with the fate of my poor little ones forbid my desertionso sayinghe threw the purse into the chaise and was going to retire  There was something so very unusual in this new mode of attacking that it was some time before Mr Greaves could speakFor my own part I was in a state of mind betwixt trembling and cryingAt length Mr Greaves who could no longer doubt of the offender's sincerity invited him  to accompany us in the chaise if he was going to town pledging himself at the same time as a man of honour not to betray himThe poor man after the deliberation of a minute sighed and ascendedthough the postilion muttered that we might be transported for harbouring robbers and might repent it before we got over the common yet  Our conversation on the way was such as might have touched the hardest heartAs soon as we were upon the pavement the gentleman got out but not before we had obtained the secret of his addressThe driver seeing him escapesaidhe had a great mind to cry stop thief for that he was sure 'twas hanging matter and he was not certain whether  he  should not come to the gallows for it himself seeing as how he was aiding and  abutting  In this conjecture he was perfectly prophetic for upon my travelling the same road in my way to the village about six months after I understood that this very identical niceminded driver had actually mounted some little time before for being detected in confederating with a gang of highwaymen to whom he gave intelligence what company had made appointments to pass by his master's house in their return to townThe poor man insisted upon leaving the purse but we did our best to alleviate his miserable condition by an equal present of five guineasI was going to give ten but Mr Greaves geatly pluckt me by the button observing  to me afterwards that five at another opportunity would very likely double their utility  CHAP XLVI  As soon as the man was gone  There  said Mr Greaves is another reason why money should be cautiously parted withWhat a noble soul must that gentleman possess and yet to what deplorable shifts is he reducedHe is a man of education but 'tis a custom to shun decayed gentlemen or at best to assist them in a way that must pierce them to the quick A beggar who has served a long apprenticeship to the business of whimpering and wailingwho lies down at the  door in despite of denial and who is in short a master of his calling feels slightly the neglect and abuse of his fellowcreature and if the footman hunts him from one haunt he hobbles on towards another but an unfortunate man of  breeding  a poor creature whose education shines through his rags and dirt feels the acumen of every insult that is cast upon himby the random sons of successin its utmost bitterness and cannot help reflecting severely on the  inhumanity  of mankindTake care therefore my dear sir what you doYou are now I suppose for the first time in London a place of various danger to all men but more especially to those of your complexionPleasure and business seem to lie upon the surface  and at the first glance neither misery or imposture will be discoveredWhen you rise in the morning every object will be gay and curiosity will pay the debt to surrounding splendor but you will be soon convinced that the  fronti nulle fides  was never more proverbially applicable than to this  great city  Proceed therefore with di  idence and step with cautionYour simplicity and kindness of heart have made me take an interestalmost paternalin your welfare and I could rejoice to pass some time with you but you already know the irresistible pathetic cause which draws me to townwhen that is over I shall be at your serviceIn the mean time taking my hand with a soft pressure which brought the water into my eyes  once again let me conjure you to be circumspect Beware that your bounty like fire does not burn itself out by its own force  Husband  the blaze and be sure some sparks remain to warm  yourself  I give a great deal to a great manybut as I have happily a great deal  yet  to bestow I pass the muster of my friends whose severest censure is a prophecy that I shall not die rich But certain it is if I were to divest myself of every thing and give the  last penny  to a starving creature I should be the jest of men the tittletattle of women and the pity of mankindMr Greaves gave me his directionstept'd into an hackney coach and bade me farewellSome time after this I paid a visit to the highwayman who at my departure gave  me the following manuscript which contains some reflections he made upon the transaction at Finchley Common But before I introduce this into my Legend I think proper to take notice that I had an opportunity to return the purse to the person from whom it was taken and  that  person forms no inconsiderable character in the  remaining  part of these

must stopafter Benignus reached London he met with a great variety of adventures all of which were strongly calculated to fix the assertions and hypothesis in the th and th chapters beyond any sort of doubt those adventures are of the most interesting naturesome of them are pathetic  all  are full of that agonizing knowledge which is usually purchased at the price of a  broken heart  The manuscript in my possession is not large but it is in so small and close a character that it would yet furnish out at least six windowfeat fashionable volumesAs I have already got beyond the limits of a letter unless it had been written upon one of those leaves which travellers assure us will  cover an acre of ground I must reserve the remainder of his Legend till another opportunityat present I can only spare my unfortunate hermit a  few more pages  for an extract or two from the record  THE LEGEND Continued from the th Chapter  I was now in the th year of my ageas emaciatedunhappydesolute a creature as ever  reluctantly  crawled on the bosom of the earth the greatest part of my fortune was gonethe remainder was in bad hands my reputation was ruinedmy wife  was deadand my health was totally

hold of me that  I  became dreadful to society I bought a sorry muletwelve sacks of common biscuitwrapt up my exhausted limbs in a horseman's coatleft the detested town and took the road to this forest  The ideas of a despairing mind are generally wild and violent Mine were the direct contraryI was not desperate but I was dying and I was unwilling to lay my bones where my body and my mind had been equally laceratedat the edge of the wood I stoptevery part was almost inacessible and appeared the more so as the moonbeam threw a shade deeper on itI knew not at what part to enter  Here madam we must make a second gap in the history and continue it from  CHAP DCCLXX  Being the last of the LEGEND  I have now been an inhabitant of the forest only five weeksI have got a few birdsmy old dog so frequently mentioned in the latter part of my historya cat that strolled one day into my cottage which is nothing better than a collection of sticks closely compacted sodded at the top and carpetted

chord that  tied the soul to the body is broken I am *  * * * * * *  This history madam together with other adventures in the world with which at some future period that world may be made acquainted have led me to a seclusion almost as retired from the bustle and intrigue of life as the unhappy author of the Legend I intend my memoirs shall serve as the counterpart of his and both will indisputedly prove and validate the peculiar truth of these singular sentiments  That nine times out of ten a life of benevolence is a life of insult and pain  That an unwearied attention to the pleasure and comfort of others is  generally repaid by ingratitude from the world  And that in a  terrestrial  sense tracing the fact through all classes of life from the nobleman in his villa to the beggar in his shedgoodness is not often in this world rewarded by such returns from  our fellow creatures  as constitute those sensations which are included in our ideas of happiness  The result of the whole madam will be  First  To be good  would to all intents and purposes be to be happy had not man degenerated in the extreme and had not his worldly interest prevailed over the prospects and promises of futurity  Secondly  That the world is permitted to exist for the same reasons it was spared in years which are far behind when the Omnipotent declared with his own facred voice thatif ten or even five just people could be found the city over which the almighty arm of vengeance was raised in suspension should be spared  Thirdly  That the perversion of money and the abuse of riches has contributed more to the corruption of human nature over every part of the habitable globe than any other thing since the invention of a commerce with it  Fourthly  That this world and more particularly the polished and voluptuous parts  of it would be intolerable to a truly good mind and of all possible places of torment the most severe to men engaged in society but unengaged in its general aims were it not for two reasons which will not only be fully given in the promised histories but may be briefly seen in the conclusive parts of these volumes  But before we pursue subjects of so grave a nature I shall beg your ladyship's leave to offer some lighter amusementI fear I have made you gloomy let us then instantly return to our fancypiecesamongst these I must number a little piece of poetry wrote a year after leaving school I shall present your ladyship with this with all the marks of juvenility about itpoor Benignus thought much  of robbing an orchard His idea might be right but I must confess to you that for my part though I had a pretty early knowledge of  meum  and  tuum  I was not quite so scrupulous as to this particular Benignus was likewise frequently insulted for this benevolencenow I avoided insult by the only way to escape it either in a school or in the worldfor I was one of their own sortdid as they did and was as thoughtless and as trickful as the best or ratherthe worst of themthe evils of life did not seize me so soon as they seized Benignus When your ladyship at a future day shall read my memoirs you will perceive too many reasons for an alteration in sentiment  ODE  TO A SCHOOLFELLOW  HAIL to the harmless seats of happy youth  To the smooth hours of genuine pleasure hail  Hail to transporthail to truth  When jocund health blew fresh in ev'ry gale  And reckless pastime spread the frolic sail  Backwards dear Youtha little cast thine eye  Let pregnant Fancy paint each early scene  And pencil fair our boyish days  The lively hope that crown'd the revel reign  Our thousand pleasuresthousand plays  If these thou hast forgotforbear to sigh  But if thou call'st to mindbestow thy sympathy  Recall the hour that set us free  From gerunds pronouns prosody  Recall the bliss that throbb'd the heart  When the glad summons bade us freely start  'Twas heaven and holiday  And ev'ry little soul was in its May  'Tis true we dealt in trifles then  But trifles catch more mighty men  Cheap were the babytoys we chose  Blithe as the ruddy morn we rose  And slept at night withall a boy's repose  We knew not  man's  amusements wild  Our wishes were the wishes of a  child  What tho' for we are heirs of pain  Even from cradle sore we sigh  And as the hill of life we gain  More rugged is the roadmore sharp the misery  What tho' some vexing troubles chose  Our sports to discompose  What tho' the lightning of the master's eye  The threat'ning tone the brow austere  Bespoke disaster near  And pedagogal tyranny  Tho' knotty points of learned lore distrest  Puzzled the head and throbb'd the breast  Tho' the keen scourgeof dreadful size  Acutely whipp'd to make us wise  The fleeting anguish never reach'd the heart  But the faint cries were transient as the smart  Soon as the sense of pain was o'er  Suspended happiness return'd  The passing tear was seen no more  The birchen sceptre lost its power  For mirth resum'd the vacant hour  And the gay stripling laughs at what he mourn'd  The soldier thus in heat of wars  Sunk by the sudden blow to ground  Still cover'd o'er with various scars  E'er well the anguish leaves the wound  Soon as he gains the strand  That girds his native land  With triumph he recounts the hardy fray  Shews the deep mark where many a bare bone lay  And smiles at all the bloodshed of the day  Can'st thou my friend recall these joys  Yet cease to wish we still were boys  Think on the deep complottings of our crew  Scheme upon scheme some arch exploir in view  The merry moonshinepranks we play'd  The little thefts at evening's fall  The truant rambles we advent'rous made  When bold we scal'd the orchard wall  Where as we reach the ruddy bough  On which the fair temptations grow  One plucks the fruitand one receives below  Ah miniature exact of man  Nature's fulllength is still on childhood's plan  But brighter colours deck the youth  Rapture and health vivacity and truth  Soft too are then the shades of care  And art wants time to paint  The figures of despair  Your ladyship will now perhaps pay a visit with me to my animalspoor creatures they have been a long time neglectedto this end we must return to my cottagethere it is madamvery properly situated for a page of descriptiona fancypiece of itselfThere is so much poetry to edge the borders of prose in this little subject that for the soul of me I cannot enter the doors without indulging the vanity of drawing  A PICTURE OF THE PREMISES  Did ever your ladyship behold the slope of any wood more beautiful than that which rises by soft gradations from the spot which my cottage occupies to the warm boundary of hills which form a vegetable screen for the valley every bush is blooming with perfume and every tree is pendent with blossomsthe hand of nature has woven me a carpet so diversified in colours and so fantastically figured that the utmost pride of Turkey droops even to dullness on the comparisonand hark madamthe note of pleasure affords for the  ear  as fair a banquet as the prospects of summer afford for  the  eye  Murmuring along the brake intercepted in its passage by the pebbles a small rill of water winds its way along the grove and at last is heard bubbling into the brook at the bottomthe river rolls majestically slow at a little distance and a stately swan the empress of the tide sails selfimportant on its bosom On the left hand is a flock at feed while some of the lambkins are slumbering in the sun and some frisking round the busheson the right the musicians of the season are warbling in the concert and the pauses of harmony are supplied by the sonorous splash of the neighbouring watermill The green sod embellishes the seat round my hutthe woodbine comes nodding into my casement and vegetation  goes smiling even to my doorsuch is the outside of my little place  And now I submit the matter to your ladyshipcould I with any fort of justice to myself or it have passed into the sweet hut without pulling you one moment by the ruffle to shew you how prettily I stood and that neither I nor my society left the town without being decently provided for in the country  Upon reading over the description of my cottage a  second time  I cannot help thinking it would make a smart morsel for the magazines or for the next poetical nosegay Mr Dodsley shall think fit to gather from the fugitive flowers of this  literary land  but as I was fearful of detaining your ladyship I have spoken of the matter  hastily and yet I do not think a single thing wanting to complete when turned into versea pastoral poemnay I am farther satisfied that what with the title the advertisementthe preface the dedication the argument and the introduction it would be quite large enough for a halfcrown pamphlet especially when your ladyship takes two points into considerationfirst that four lines of prose will at any time make fourteen of poetry and secondly that the present taste of printing is so extremely white and delicate that a very  few  lines will go a  great  way insomuch that upon a pretty nice calculation it would be found that sixpennyworth of sense and twelve pennyworth of paper allowing for  fashionable margins will when properly manufactured produce half a dozen pocket volumes at the  moderate  price of three shillings per volume We will now madam step into  THE HUT  Oh force of animal gratitude how the creatures croud around us we have left them but a few hours and they are ready to devour us with their fondnesseven the superanuated pointer bestirs himself on this occasionpoor fellow he is the son of an unhappy sire whose story goes I verily think as near to the heart as any that was ever recordedand yet I am afraid I shall hurry your ladyship too quickly back into the region of gloomy sentiments  should I relate itbut there is a pleasure even in the anxieties of sympathy and as the story is now fresh in my memory and my letter drawing to the end 'twere a pity to suppress it  PASSAGES of a TRUE STORY  Oh RomeoRomeo what a creature wert thouhow courteous how sagacioushow well tempered  He was descended madam from a glorious line the son of a noble stockvenerable from his pedigree royal in his extraction and to crown his character he was the favourite companion of a dear friend of mine who is nowno more  In one of the sharpest days and yet one of the fairest that winter could produce the youthful Flavian prepared with his gun and his Romeo to take the diversions of the fieldhappiest of menhappiest of dogsThey were particularly lucky and it was a day of eminent successthis pointed the gamethat brought it to the ground the net was soon crouded with the spoilbut as Flavian was returning  Notwithstanding the elevation of your rank your ladyship must have had frequent occasion to deplore the capricious uncertainty of sublunary enjoymentsmust have seen the eye that in the present moment sparkled with hope in the next rolling with despair and tears usurp the features which  an hour before were dimpled by joy this is indeed so hackneyed and universal a fact that I should beg your pardon for digressing into a parenthesis about it  As Flavian was returning to his house and Romeo was ranging the skirts of acopse rather in the way of wantonness than industryknowing perhaps that the business of the day was already donejust as the winding of the thicket meander'd into an elbow that jutted into the fieldRomeo broke short his step and stood fixed in an attitude which put Flavian on his guard In the next instant an hare started from the bushes and ran trembling to the opposite hedgerow on the other side of which was a shaded lane that led to Flavian's villa  There is an enthusiasm which seizes the sportman at the sight of sudden game With that sort of inspiration was Flavian now seized who levelling his gun to the mark with an aim too fatally erring deposited the charge into the bosom of * *  Mighty GodI want fortitude to go on  Flavian madam hada wifeunhappily for him she was tempted by the brightness of the morning and the report of his fowling piece at no great distance to strole from her house and as was sometimes her tender customintended to hasten his return not only to enjoy his society but to put an end to the depredations of the dayThe sound of the gun had  scarcely died upon the air when a sound of a different kind saluted the ear Flavian dashed through the hedge and saw his Maria extended along the pathway which was overhung by the bushes and her bosom was bathed in that blood which she now found had been shed by her husband In pursuing the game Romeo first discovered his mistress and with his fourfeet upon her lap was mourning over her wounds the agony was so legible in his countenance that if he had the power of speechit would have been impossible to describe it  The husbandah madam In these cases as I have just remarked the brute and the man are alike since both must deliver over to the dumb sensations of the heart a language  neither science nor instinct can teach them to articulateall that can be said or done is dull paintinghe struck his breastcast an eye of astonishment at heaven and fell speechless by her sidethe poor woman saw his agonymadean effort to embrace him but sunk exhausted on his breast  A servant of Flavian's who had been on a message now appeared upon the road in the laneRomeo ran to himleaped round his horselooked up to the manand led the way to the scene of deathThe servant rode away on the spur to alarm the family at the mansionhousein the mean time the last endearments were faintly interchanged betwixt Flavian and Maria to the latter articulation was soon deniedbut she by some means got  her husband in her arms and in that situation expiredthe distress of Flavian affected not even yet his tongue the dear body mangled as it was could not be torn from him and both he and the unhappy lady were carried to that apartment from which they had parted a few hours before in the highest gaiety of wedded hearts and in the warmest ardours of youthful expectation And now comes on the business of poor RomeoFlavian fell sickRomeo was the very centinel of his door and the nurse of his chambera fever followed which at length touched Flavian on the brain and in the violence of the delirium he struck his poor attendant Romeo who so far from resenting the blow licked lovingly the hand that gave it  madness shifted into melancholy Romeo was still by the side of the bed fearful to step even on the carpet after thisthe fever returned and burning its way to the heart in a few days desied physic and united his ashes to those of his beloved Mariafrom the room in which he died no force or contrivance could seduce Romeo till the moment in which he was put into the coffin and the people concerned in his funeral began to deem it necessary to destroy the dog which resisted all their measures but especially their carrying him away at length he suffered itbut followed them close and was perhaps the most sincere mourneras soon as Flavian was committed to the earth his faithful Romeo took dominion of the spot and was  the sentry of his gravegrief and hunger had exhausted every thing but his attachmentyet he never was heard to whinebut after laying till nature could do no more he was at length found dead at the foot of the tombthus the master expired and the servant found it impossible to survive him  Methinks I see your ladyship shed a tear to the complicated misfortunes of this familyI congratulate you upon itFie upon the heart that is asham'd to feeland wither'd be the cheek that in defiance of the impulses of nature is kept dry by the maxims of fashionbut neither the above story madam nor any other in the present volumes were introduced merely to excite sensibilityIt finds a place amongst these pages as a suitable vehicle for some  MORAL OPINIONS  In the few anecdotes of Benignus were briefly shewn that nine times out of tenTo be good in this world  Was not the wayTo be happy  That isnot to be happy if our behaviour and its consequences were to take their rewards from the returns of our fellowcreatures in general The reason assigned for this is the only true reason that can be assigned The degenerate state of maxims and manners  All the evils therefore which are of a malignant natureall such as arise from the perversion of moneyor turbulence of passions are totally to be imputed to human sourcesbut there are other evils and some extremely  sore that fall out to make goodness no security for worldly happiness TheseI mean such as absolutely are placed beyond the reach or prevention of man are certainly the acts of the Deitywe call them under the vague name of  accidents  they light equally on man and beast and every thing that hath an existence and for ought we can tell they may possibly affect vegetation and carry the distress beyond the scale that is animated As great proportions of that misery which cloggs the path of life therefore is caused by the bad propensities of menso it must of necessity be admitted that the road which leads from this world to the next is made additionally wearisome and heavy by the permission of some power superior  to theirs It is peculiar to the most rational animal as he is called to perceive this though he cannot adequately account for itto account for it indeed has been the labour of the most shining understandings divinesmoraliststheologistsphilosophersmetaphysicians and poets have exerted every nerve in every age upon the subject The most pions and industrious of these all concur in their sentiments and conclude with the same ideasThey say  That though to be good may not be rewarded in general with the gratitude of our fellowcreatures and that virtuous characters are commonly insulted by the multitude who are creatures of ignorance and interest yet a man is sufficiently rewarded for  his rectitude even in this world by the endearing society of men like himselfbesides whichthe comforts of conscience are more than a counterbalance for the severest sufferings to which are added the chearful prospects of futurity  That with respect to all those numberless disasters which fall out in despite of human sagacitythe answer always has been and still continues to be thisThey are trialscc  There is indisputably a great deal of consolitary truth in both these conclusions Some part of the argument however is liable to objectionzeal will very often run away with the powers of reflection The system of men of religious moderation is comprized in the short passages above  More intemperate people who call themselves free thinkers have under that title assumed a privilege to argue very boldly on the other side of the question Some have contended that if vice is natural to the heart of man it must be an effort as ridiculous as impossible to resist itthe shocking inference is that God is the sole origin of evil and that he certainly would not punish his creatures for yielding to a necessity in their nature others madam of our own nation the very soil of freethinking say it would be an act of benevolence to withdraw evil from every part of the globeanother asserts that vices and miseries of all kinds are peculiar benefits and that to a trading nation especially they are the  very mainspring in the political machine There have also been and still are a set of loose pens which skilled in the trick of sophistry exculpate every wickedness in man at the blasphemous risque of lodging the cause and fault of the whole upon the  Deity  and a celebrated Frenchman whose genius is the pride of that polite nation has written a book in the seventieth year of his age to prove that of all possible systems the system under which we are governed is the worst These deserve and meet the indignation of every honest man A much anmired countryman of our own madam has in a composition that contains the most poetical philosophy in our language advanced seriously an opposite  sentiment and terminates the whole by declaring whatever is is right My own opinions on this important subject are I dare say like those of your ladyshipI think  every  work of God vindicable but I do not think some of them reconcilable to reason by the beaten mode of defending them There are at this instant thousands of our amiable fellowcreatures in the world bad as it isstruggling with the storms of fate without finding relief in the society of men like themselves for it will be easy to prove that even the tenderest and worthiest connexions of a man fly off in the hour of necessity nor will it be more difficult to shewif it could possibly need an instance beyond the reach of any one's experiencethat  poverty in the extreme is often accompanied with the loss of reputation Those are yet babies in the world who suppose half the bad reports they hear of men are the consequences of their ill conduct for the fact is that there are a pretty equal number of wretches deserted by their friends because their unworthiness unsitted them for what is called virtuous society and of wretches deserted because their illluck in life drove them too often against the purses of their acquaintancefor I must once again repeat that the abuse of riches has made avarice the ruling viceand there is sometimes the highest degree of avarice even in dissipation self still settles at the bottom Nor are even the comforts of conscience always  sufficient to bear a man up against the insults of mankind for many of our species are so pelted by the tempests of life that the purest integrity and the sweetest reflections  resulting  from that integrity are obliged to give way to the misfortunes which croud incessantly upon them Sorrow treads fast upon sorrow calamity strikes upon calamity and accident comes stumbling so rapidly upon accident that the whole business of the  soul  is to shift for the necessities of the  body  or to try the force of its religion to accommodate itself with proper patience to bear its allotment without plunging into the errors of despair Instances of this kind are extremely numerous Men indeed who are plumped by prosperity and indolently loiter out an unserviceable  existence in the easy chair of voluptuousness and women who are tied down to a peculiar set of amusements ideas and pursuits may see this matter in the light which their contracted teachers have  taught  them to see it But the sons and daughters of luck and luxury are the worst judges of the sons and daughters of misfortune The grand amuletthe only  effectual  remedy of sorrow remains behind and that is a  universal  oneample enough for the cure of misery even tho'  misery  was universal  the prospects of futurity  when friends forsake usfoes oppress us and conscience is cowed by constant adversitythose madam and those only prevent despair and point to felicityWith regard to the evils of  accident nothing but those can reconcile them with the line of our most natural notions of eternal goodness and those do reconcile them to the sublimest idea that ever was conceived of itBut let us turn aside from argument and look upon life for exemplary  PROOF OF THIS MATTER  Among other accidents that could only be reconciled by the  prospects of futurity  is the story and fate of Flavian and his familyhow agrees itmight we argue  but  for those prospects with the beneficence of the Creator to asslict so much morality and goodness without any  apparent  cause In short madam the human soul  ebbs and flows like the ocean though not with the same regularity There is no purity nor any devotion but sometimes wavers for a  moment  believe me there are periods when the most apostolic faith staggers aye and that upon principle for the better the mind the greater is its occasional agitation Divines tells us it is sinful I insist it is unavoidable and I will in this case be so bold to enter a caveat against all the cassocks in the kingdom There is an intricacy in the events of the world which will on the first view constantly appear mysterious They frequently put the human intellect upon the puzzle We want not books or arguments to teach us ambiguities for every  rational sense  about us presses the  whys  and  wherefores  spontaneously and irresistibly upon us 'Tis not madam the vanity of penetration 'tis merely the curiosity and inquiring propensity of nature  It was with a propriety peculiar to the classic genius of Mr Addison that he called these labyrinths of providence that so frequently cross the lines of life"a regular consusion" Let us examine that celebrated expression and it may perhaps lead us into a train of thought which may throw new light on our present subjects both with relation to man and brute The eye of God and possibly the eyes of his angels may see the regularity unintangled in the confusion But what proves this more than that finite can by  no means measure with infinite To man's imperfect vision many events already hinted at in this letter and many more which might be brought into the catalogue of instances are not only repugnant to every moral natural or conscientious law were we to decide of them by the narrow line of human justice but are utterly opposite to our own ideas of common compassion Still farther I beg leave to advance the matter  much  farther It is a fact attested by the tears and agonies of a mournful multitude that the horrid variety of miseries which attack the attention on all sides would tempt the soberest head and the devoutest heart in the world to suspect that the affairs of that world were totally eclipsed in confusion  without a single ray of apparent regularity judging as was observed above and faintly guided through  the dark  only by the twilight glimmerings of natural reason and natural equity  To prove this there arise at once so many instances that choice is perplext in variety Let us quit the fireside madam for half an hour and turning our eyes on the active world walk leisurely along to survey the great scenes that are slecting before us If it is agreeable to your Jadyship we will make  A MORAL AND SENTIMENTAL EXCURSION  And London shall be the boundary of our ramble That stupendous mass of building contains every thing for our purpose perhaps there never was more happiness and misery crouded together upon the same space of ground since the foundations of the world In the first place for your ladyship must suppose yourself endowed with a power of stepping into whatever places you think proper during this tourwe will pay a visit to that wretched looking house and though I am taking you into those sad retreats which are very uncustomary to people of fashion yet we will walk up the broken  stairs and open the door of that chamber Pray survey it with a critical eye The spectre Famine hath usurped the seat of Plenty There are seven small children without any symptoms of the health and rosy hilarity which usually attends the most untroubled period of lifethe pale young woman whose arm is round one of the youngest with one still smaller which she is dandling on her knce is their mother and that tottering phantom of a man whom age hath rendered fecbler than the feeblest of the children is the father of that motherI beg pardon I have overlooked a personage of no small consequence At the side of the broken lattice you behold one of the king's officers He has a paper in his  hand a pen in his mouth and his eyes are running up and down the room in the most eager dispatch For once we will dispense with fashionable ceremonies and peep over his left shoulder This method has enabled us to read what he entitles  AN INVENTORY  One tablesplit in the left lid and two of the joints wanting  One cradle

which we must bear testimony he was conscientiously particular and is going out of the  room we will follow his example ahmadam the tears are swimming round your eye and your hand is in your pocket There thenGod prosper you with it poor woman see if one of the infants is not quite taken with the flowers upon your ladyship's gown another faintly plucks me by the skirt of my coat and is paying strong court to my buttonsthe mother is upon her knees to youshe thinks and looks the gratitude she is unable to speaklet us hurry away before the scene becomes too interesting even the smoky air of one of the most smoky streets of the suburbs is chearful and salubrious to the oppression I felt in the chamber we have just leftA coach will carry us to a more agreeable part of the town  inhabited by different sort of people in this square we will stop for here is breathingroom Hark how the roll of the chariots the report of the horses feet and the echo of the doors prepare us for the magnificence of fashion We are now in the very region of finery As sudden transitions have always a great effectI will now take your ladyship into a very splendid apartmentthese foldingdoors will admit us  because  we shall not look as if we had no doors of our own for in all cases of that sort there is a peculiar difficulty in getting on the other side of the knocker which for the most part is supported in the jaws of some monster that seems to say to every necessitous crawler or even to every shabby gentleman  come if you dare approach and be devoured Luckily for us madam there is always another monster appears the instant the door opens and as he constantly acts upon the liberal principles of Cerberus we will give him a sufficient sop upon which he will become immediately so tame that he will make the hinges echo again even though we were come to dun his keeper The arts of opening a door and delivering a message are sciences that would very well fill a volumeI shall therefore certainly stand excused for having scribbled only a page upon the subject  We are now walking up the geometrical stairsthat door opening upon another door will lead us to another green door which will lead us to  the apartment where the family are assembled at breakfast How beautifully and warmly the whole room is carpetted and cushionedWe perceive at the table three hearty childrena lady of an elegant figure and a gentleman in his nightgown and slippers Bless mehow the servants bowwhat a profusion of gilding and plate and see madam the youngest boy is actually tossing an handful of guineas up and down the floor by way of amusement I heartily wish the poor children we have just left had the trouble to pick them up for my young master If your ladyship will please to retire I will tell you something as you go along worth hearing of this family  The gentleman madam whom you saw in the morningdress is one of those human beings Providence hath for some wise end permitted to hold the happiness and comforts of a great many other human beings in his possession In the English language he is known by the name of a  creditor  the moral definition of which term is simply thisa man who having the good things of this life in great abundance distributes a small portion of those good things to such as are destitute a kind of benevolence that would reflect dignity upon the author were it not liable to a trifling circumstance which some will think a drawback upon itfor the benefactor commonly chooses to take in return a small slip of paper by virtue of which  he can torment and have the person benefitted as it were on the hip at a moment's warning and in fault of payment acquires full authority either to seize the body and deposit it in a jail or take possession of the goods and turn the body into the street In some parts of the future history of Benignus will be delineated the whole and extensive science of mancatching wherein will be shewn that the slavetrade flourishes surprisingly in Great Britain and that the traffic of buying and selling the human species is daily gaining ground through every part of his majesty's dominions and this is esteemed so curious and original a part of the manuscript that I expect a prodigious consideration for the copy  In the above work however a proper and nice distinction is made as to the nature and contraction of debts insomuch that it will infallbily prove a sure guide to creditor debtor and bailiff for those madam are the principal agents in this humane and excellent art I cannot quit this subject without presenting your ladyship with a slight specimen of the above sort of merchandise The business is frequently transacted thus one man in distress borrows in an humble tone with his hat under his arm and in all the confusion of want of another man in no distress whatever value fortyshillings as misfortune is apt to expect a sunshiny day even in the midst of hard weather disappointment trips up the heel of hope and the day of  restitution runs by in which the said forty shillings remains like the handwriting on the wall against him From that moment the bargain is struckthe purchaser demands his property and as the transaction is sanctified by the laws of the land the carcase is at his discretion it is dragged from its friends and so cautiously prevented from taking cold in the open air that it is put very tenderly under lock and key and bar and bolt that it is in a perfect cage here a parcel of crows are suffered to peck at it which are a kind of guarantees to the purchaser of the body  And now we will go on with our storythe gay spark who is the subject of our present enquiry became a creditor to the povertystruck  family whom we saw in the suburbs of the town by being landlord or possessor of a range of ruins among which is the uncomfortable hut we described The master of that hut who is at present out of the way is amongst the number of those against whose tranquillity the dark events of this life were perpetually pointed The consequence of this which is pretty frequently the case was the desertion of acquaintances and the distance of friends and he was often accused of obliquity though in truth he seldom deviated into those crooked paths which justly excite agony and shame He was unable to answer the inclinations of his heart and was two years in arrear for the rent One morning the poor man's wife waited  at the door of Sophron for so will we call him and delivered an apology by great chance the porter thought fit to deliver it immedately and by a chance still greater the young woman was admitted into the prefence chamber where Sophron was indulging the surfeiting luxuries of his situation Distress had not at that time wholly destroyed the beauty which was naturally extraordinary in hershe caught the fancy of the present moment Sophron proposed an immediate treaty and offered moreover a purse for the relief of her starving familyGenerous as this might be she flatly refused it As Sophron was not much accustomed to the language of denial and thought besides his offer not only an honour  but a liberality he ordered her hastily to depart She did so and in going home felt one of those sensations which for a moment relieves the sense of the worst condition by the triumph of the conscience She told the whole to her husband and in his rewarding embrace she felt those sensations revived But where misery is constantly shifting from one sorrow to another the pleasures of reflection can seldom have leisure to playWhat was the result of this matterwithdraw a moment madam to that gloomylooking pilethe common receptacle the promiscuous deposit of distress and infamy for a length of yearswe will wind up the dreadful stairs alas how does novelty give force to objects which custom has rendered  unnoticed the grating of the bars the jingle of the keys and the clank of the chains I see terrify your ladyshippray stop awhile in that dismal cell behold the consequence of a wife's unseasonable chastity and virtuethere lies the husbandSophron had once risqued as he called it the loan of ten guineas for that sum he was arrested and for the rent his goods will shortly be sold  And here madam let me pay a compliment to the justice sagacity and christianity of our lawmakers lawmakers of the most refined and polished nation under heaven who have assigned to unfortunate men who owe and have the least money a residence of the greatest  gloom hardship and discredit amongst wretches who have broken at midnight into our housesassassins who have shed the blood of our species and robbers who commit hostilities upon the road Encircled by such associates is Sophronhis children are famishing at homehis wife is condemned to see the necessity every moment encrease his house has suffered a distresstheir next migration must be into the streetthe plain reason is thisthe wife was virtuousthe husband unfortunate while the oppressor revels in his plenitude though his fortunes were obtained by fraud and are dissipated in every kind of debauchery Behold madam the wife is herself entering the cellshe has brought the poor  creature a share of that refreshment your ladyship's bounty has enabled her to procure  Heavens what a shout is there See they are bringing in a fresh prisonerHow the old inhabitants cluster round the new comer as they would say Welcome to Newgate brotherPray Mr Jaylor what is his crime  murder  a man was executed yesterday se'nnight under a public gallows upon strong suspicion of committing that very murder which this prisoner has confessed There is a confusion in the innocence of some people and a cross concurrence of illlooking circumstances very like the blushing evidences of guilt Such was the present caseappearances were strong against him human  sagacity was baffled and the victim was given up to the lawshe had a large family his wife is in a fever his son is burying reflection in the dreadful opiates of the bottle and his connexions are in deep and disgraceful mourning  Yonder madam lies a miserable objectunnatural parents have driven her from homeshe is too honest to stealshe is ashamed to beg and being from the pecularity of her fate under a necessity to borrowshe is at last provided for by the bounty of government that humanely allows the wretched just food enough to perpetuate the sense and lengthen out the period of calamity But now we will leave the sufferings of our own species and in our way home cast an eye upon the sufferings of  THE ANIMAL WORLD  Take notice how you team groan under the burthen They are labouring in this severe weather for the service of man But observe their driver hark how the knotted whip sounds on their sides The blood gushes at every strokethe poor things labour in the extremity and when they have surmounted the difficuly the sanguinary master pats them on the neck not a little pleased with the triumphant vigour of his arm If it could possibly be supposed that brutes deserved a state of perpetual punishment a large city were surely their hell A few lapdogs spaniels  and other favourites exceptedthe general treatment of animals is savage beyond all comparison of barbarity  There  stands a cruel wretch who hath beaten out the eye of the forehorse for presuming to stir while the car is unloading he then curses himself for the exploit and concludes the matter by a second blow because the creature threw its eye in the way of the first and see madam you fellow in passing carelesly drives his carriage against another that is going a different road and in order to extricate the intertangled harnesses both drivers apply to the old remedy and instead of calmly setting things right put the animals on their spirit and every thing is at length torn in pieces a fresh beating now ensues and the  poor devils are to suffer again for what at first could not on their part be avoided Such are the general lives of horses and such the discipline practised upon them almost every hour  It is an happiness peculiar to the softness of your sex and consistent with the delicate prosperity of the female nature and situation madam that their pursuits and pleasures entirely lay in such parts of the town as make shocking spectacles not very frequent if we compare them with the more busy parts of the cityThere isI cannot but perceivea civilization of address an urbanity of demeanour amongst the very chairmen of St James's which we shall in vain look for in the messengers of Whitechapel  and the porters of Thamesstreet The politesse of the court ever influences in some degree the places that surround it but in the city the spirit of humanity is too often trod under feet by the spirit of trade and the laws of trade have indeed so very little in general to do with the laws of benevolence that in the full and I might say the overflowing tide of commercial success a man of business seldom regardeth any life but such as is necessary to push the point of gain to the extremity  I must once more draw your ladyship out of the way to take a view of SmithfieldThere madamit is high market and the distemper which some time since raged amongst the horned cattle even to the alarm of  the nation was mercy and providence to the usage which the poor creatures sustain in this placeAll that sticks stones and irongoads can effect is here effected against those inoffensive animals by which plenty is procured riches circulated and even life supported  Here madam we have selected a few of those innumerable instances which rise up to alarm us That such have often happened cannot be denied and if we were to take a closer survey of the world with a view to collect a more accurate journal of calamityif we were to bring into the black account the miseries both of the rich and poorthe thousand dreadful casualties which no innocence can help with the tens of thousands  of fatal operations of passion which deform existence and agonize our heartsif we were to consider likewise the plagues the disgusts the cares the conteststhe depredations of war and the voluptuousness of peaceif we were to look into the prodigious mass of miscellaneous mischiefs branching out from avarice prodigality gaming swearing lawsuits robberies chagrines murders and every other prophanationor if we were to dive still further and mention the distressful situations occasioned by fire famine pestilence earthquakes inundations public tumults and domestic inquietude observing at the same time that thousands of every race of beings are frequently pining away life inch by  inch and are whole years in dying adding to this eventful catalogue the pangs of sickness the loss of limbs the deprivation of intellect the undeserved loss of character the disobedience of children and the cruelty of parents with the horrid havock of those detestable appetites of the heart revenge and inordinate desire what madambut for the chearful promises of  an hereafter  what should we thinkwhat should we say  That there is much happiness many blessings and many people who deserve them cannot be disputedthe world is in  itself  a paradisebut passions perverted accidents permittedmischiefs perpetrated and money turned into the wrong channel have so destroyed its serenity that the  soul distressed in the world is obliged to seek frequently for a retired corner and argue with itself These reflections naturally lead us to the  CONCLUSION  It has been the constant design of the author of this letter to examine several facts relating to men animalsand things in a new manner with this ultimate viewto vindicate the ways of God not only to  man  but to every  other  living creature The limits I proposed to allow myself are more than exceeded and the length of my letter swelled into volumes seems to demand an apology  The utmost that I can venture more is to present your ladyship with a few inferences drawn from the whole of our ramble amongst the fields of unusual speculation  As the innocent man madam has often lost his life and disgraced his relations on suspicion of guiltas the hardness of a creditor frequently tightens the cord of the law till it pinches the bowels of a numerous family as there are actually parents in the world which not only desert their offspring but sear up that strong attachment which is generally the vital principle of natureas modesty ingenuity and honesty are often harrassed by innumerable cares and perplexities to soothe which even the compliments of the conscience are not  always adequateand ason the other handthose to whom fortune hath been fullerhanded frequently disturb the good order of society and use their adventitious acquisitions to promote oppression and to extend luxury As those who address the Deity in fervor of heart are often destitute of a comfortable proportion of food wander naked and forlorn through life and others that have food want appetite to eat itwhile those who never mention the Deity but to enforce an oath and give poignancy to blasphemy enjoy every temporal good as even the unblemish'd state of childhood when power is wanting to perpetrate intentional guiltas the newborn babe frequently struggles with various distress at a time when its  weakness calls for peculiar supports wanting which its future existence is sometimes wasted under the languors of an unsound constitutionas these with every other calamity I have recapitulated or advanced through this letterand as many more than can be possibly suggested at a single view have and do actually light upon the human racenotwithstanding all the comforts and all the blessings in the worldsome astonishing source of consolation is absolutely necessary to reconcile these facts to the mind To decide upon the matter as was hinted before agreeable to our ideas of rectitude we should pronounce it without hesitation a monstrous system which confounds right and wrong innocence and error Natural  reason would condemn it as inconsistentPagan philosophy would reject it as barbarous pedantry would call it unfitpoetry would declare it unjustcommon sense would pronounce it absurd  Here then madam the two comfortable reasons I have promised to give as the only reconciling ones that can possibly make life supportable or the strange intricacies of it consistent deserve to be mentioned They come to us under the cherubic forms of FAITH and RELIGIONjust as we are sinking under our doubts they come forward to dispel them they give strength to reasonforce to philosophy and illumination to conscience the wretched insulted heart listens to  their arguments and finds them decisiverevelation herself steps into our reliefshe confesses with the poet there is apparent confusion in the regularity of Providencethat the cloudy mirrour through which the human eye is directed in purblind speculation represents the path of virtue as thorny and crooked and the road to vice flowery and delightful but thatwere it possible for men to wind with their Creator through all the infinitude of mazes that lead from first causes to ultimate effectsto view all the labyrinths which are absolutely necessary to connect continue and complete the system the whole matter would be inverted and the regularity appear without confusion  Thus therefore madam all comes right at last  To be good is to be happy  The confusion is regular and  Whatever is is right  A future life onlyin every instance I have mentioned and in many that I have omitted to mention can make the present life supportable or the present system equitable And upon these rational principles I would argue the essentiality of that futuritybut not so much from the power and wisdom as from the benevolence of the hand that hath prepared us for itnor is the attribute of justice less concerned in this provisionfor were the death of the body the  death also of the soulthe devil himself as the system now stands might yet want a malignity in his nature to continue it and in that case the wisest way to put an end to a man's torments would be the shortest and suicide would obtain a sanction from common sense The very equity and tenderness of the supreme Power is concerned in a distribution of future punishments and rewardsto those attributes therefore should every unhappy creature look upfrom them should expect the hour in which that which is "now crooked shall be made strait" and every unevenness be smoothed when the balances shall be poised by an omnipotent arm and justice at last prevail  Having thus vindicated the ways of God to man I will now put an end to my letter and beg you will accept it at the hand of  Your ladyship's most humble and obedient servant *** ***  POSTSCRIPT  As these sketches are designed for publication and are to stand at the tribunal of a society of literati who review and take cognizance of every thing that ventures into this world of composition I shall lay myself too  negligently  open to their censure if I leave ultimately the animal creation in the lurchafter having all along declared so much in its favor And this renders a  postscript  essentially necessary Nor should I indeed stand excuseable to your ladyship if I omitted so material a part of the conclusions to be drawn from our survey of the subjectHaving vindicatednotwithstanding  all the miseries of good men and the successes of bad menthe dispensations of God towards our own species let us now then madam in the same transient unsystematic manner vindicate the ways of God to a numerous race of beings no otherwise connected with our species than by the ties either of attachment or necessity  GOD VINDICATED TO BRUTE  Methinks madam the haughtyhearted man takes fire at thiswhat would the wicked wretch put the reptile and the rational upon an equality Would he give to the almost undistinguishable atom to  the dog that laqueys my heel and to various monsters of the forest and the ocean the same prospects with man with the erectthe comprehensivethe superior God vindicated to  brute  oh infamous blasphemous inconsistent shall the ox that I kill for the ordinary supply of my appetite and the mule that I drive for my diversion be upon a level with their masterare they not all born to accommodate our convenience are they not all put in subjection to our controul and do we not treat them accordinglyI have no time to answer the cavils of selfsufficiency we will proceed cooly madam  Let us argue this point from the impulses of common sensein our survey of the sufferings of brutes it  appeared that with a great deal less cause they underwent at any rate as much hardship as men our inspection indeed into this matter like our inspection into the calamities of our own species was slight and cursory but were we to set apart a serious opportunity to examine the subject to the bottom we should find animal misery as extended and as exquisite as human I admit that they are destitute of reason and it must be owned that a  moral  sense of the injuries men suffer frequently give poignancy to the anguish the mind takes as it were an interest in the sufferings of the body thus a blow on the face is resented not because of the pain but because of the idea annexed by the soul to such an act  and with respect to other miseries and accidents the mind by sympathizing often doubles them This may be brought against me as an argument It is none madam Even if the sensations of animal pain were merely corporeal they must be sufficiently terrible when we consider that they are molested by every innovation of torture But I do not apprehend their sensations of anguish only  bodily  they have not reason but they have  something  that does the business of reason so well that man is very often put to the blush and is almost ashamed of the privilege that sets him at the top of the scale The fact isbrutes are as sensible of insults done to each other as men these they resent indifferentlyif they do  not often resent the barbarities of men it is not I should conceive madam because they do not feel the indignity but because the benevolent Creator has implanted in their natures a strong principle either of terror or obedience an unlimited idea of human  superiority  or an unlimited idea of his  tyranny  Be this as it may certain it is that the situation of animals in this life particularly such as are subdued to the domestic dominion of man and such commonly display the most amiable qualities is not such as can possibly make that life upon the whole desirable In a state of nature where they took peaceful possession of the woods it might be different In their present state of subordination to the imperious law of man nothing can exceed  their miseries nor can any miseries be more diversified Will it be urged that a great many of them are savage in their natures and cruel to each otherthat they are at continual warinvade the repose property and pleasures of one anotherthat they actually subsist by murder and rapineand that man is justified in his usage to them nor can they upon  this  account fairly claim protection or redress from Providence This would prove a sorry argument Do not  men  live upon each otherare not they at perpetual warare not many of them savage in their natures do not they disturb the peace and invade the property of their fellowcreaturesis not every paltry trick tried and every dirty  passion put in motion to perplex overreach and fret one another is not this so general a fact that the eye seesthe ears ear and the heart feels it  every hour  Is it not the tale of tradition the burthen of compositionthe history of the day and the evidence of every newspaperspreads it not over the most distant climatesfrom the polished European who seizes his prey under a mask to the honest Hotentot who roasts it upon the ground and sits openly down to his banquetand yet where madam is the man who would from hence argue that for these reasons they must never look up for mercy but die without hope without expectationwithout prospect Rather let them mend the imperfections  they have been so sharpsighted to detect If the cruel inclination subsisting in the bosoms of particular brutes strikes them with horror let it operate properly upon the  human  heart but let them reflect that the  animal  never kills but to gratify the calls of famine or in its own defencebut that the  rational  frequently murders for sport and inflicts pain from a principle of malignity  The state of animals after they leave the present world has been the subject of very distinguished talents and some have very warmly contended for their immortality Amongst sacred writers Moses and Solomon have leaned much in their favour amongst moderns Mr Locke  Dr Hildrop Soame Jennings and many others have taken up the cause neither have French Spanish or Roman authors been without conjectures on the subject So that I have a sufficient sanction to enter the list as the champion of so many  millions  of useful beautiful and innocent beings  Look upon your Favourite how harmlesshow affectionate would it not hurt you to consider that in a very few years the poor creature must putrify in the dust and mixing with it soon become common earth without hope of resurrection for my part nothing could give a keener shock to my sensibility than the horrid idea of universal annihilation  prevailing over the animal worldI protest madam I am almost ready to shed a tear to the very sentimentMust my dear Tabythyettamy demure Grimalcena my merry Scugypugissayou will pardon me madam for  Italianizing  their names there is something so dreadfully dull and mechanic in the sound of an English appellation must all these with that great traveller Tripsea sink into nothingnessinto oblivion into dirt  Oh horrible horrible most horrible  But I see madam I am likely to swell my postscript to the unreasonable  size of my letter and yet if you knew how extremely painful it is for a man warmed by his subject and entertain'd by his ideasjust as that subject begins to take possession of himwhile a swarm of benevolent arguments are pouring their honey in upon him and charm him with the prospect of carrying his pointif you knew the pangs that laying aside the pen in so delicate a moment costs a writeryou would certainly pity me however I have said enough of this matter and every other just to shew my  intentions  and I beg your ladyship and I beg also my critics may consider the whole as a mere collection of etchingsthe pencil roughly run over themthe outlines just marked  but that the boldnessthe graces the proportionsthe retouchings and the sinishings must be the business of several sedate cautious and careful future opportunities  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
