Mr  Jones  in his Journey from St  Albans p  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK VII  Containing three Days  CHAP I  A Comparison between the World and the Stage  THE World hath been often compared to the Theatre and many grave Writers as well as the Poets have considered human Life as a great Drama resembling in almost every Particular those scenical Representations which  Thespis  is first reported to have invented and which have been since received with so much Approbation and Delight in all polite Countries  This Thought hath been carried so far and become so general that some Words proper to the Theatre and which were at first metaphorically applied to the World are now indiscriminately and literally spoken of both Thus Stage and Scene are by common Use grown as familiar to us when we  speak of Life in general as when we confine ourselves to dramatic Performances and when we mention Transactions behind the Curtain  St James's  is more likely to occur to our Thoughts than  DruryLane  It may seem easy enough to account for all this by reflecting that the theatrical Stage is nothing more than a Representation or as  Aristotle  calls it an Imitation of what really exists and hence perhaps we might fairly pay a very high Compliment to those who by their Writings or Actions have been so capable of imitating Life as to have their Pictures in a Manner confounded with or mistaken for the Originals  But in Reality we are not so fond of paying Compliments to these People whom we use as Children frequently do the Instruments of their Amusements and have much more Pleasure in hissing and buffeting them than in admiring their Excellence There are many other Reasons which have induced us to see this Analogy between the World and the Stage  Some have considered the larger Part of Mankind in the light of Actors as personating Characters no more their own and to which in Fact they have no better Title than the Player hath to be in Earnest thought the King or Emperor whom he represents Thus the Hypocrite may be said to be a Player and indeed the  Greeks  called them both by one and the same Name  The Brevity of Life hath likewise given Occasion to this Comparison So the immortal  Shakespear  Life's a poor Player  That storms and struts his Hour upon the Stage  And then is heard no more  For which hackneyed Quotation I will make the Reader Amends by a very noble one which few I  believe have read It is taken from a Poem called the DEITY published about nine Years ago and long since buried in Oblivion A Proof that good Books no more than good Men do always survive the bad  From thee  The DEITY  all human Actions take their Spring  The rise of Empires and the Fall of Kings  See the  VAST THEATRE OF TIME  display'd  While o'er the Scene succeeding Heraes tread  With Pomp the shining Images succeed  What Leaders triumph and what Monarchs bleed  Perform the Parts thy Providence assign'd  Their Pride their Passions to thy Ends inclin'd  A while they glitter in the Face of Day  Then at thy Nod the Phantoms pass away  No Traces left of all the busy Scene  But that Remembrance says  THE THINGS HAVE BEEN  In all these however and in every other Similitude of Life to the Theatre the Resemblance hath been always taken from the Stage only None as I remember have at all considered the Audience at this great Drama  But as nature often exhibits some of her best Performances to a very full House so will the Behaviour of our Spectators no less admit the above mentioned Comparison than that of her Actors In this vast Theatre of Time are seated the Friend and the Critic here are Claps and Shouts Hisses and Groans in short every Thing which was ever seen or heard at the Theatre Royal  Let us examine this in one Example For Instance in the Behaviour of the great Audience on that Scene which Nature was pleased to exhibit in the th Chapter of the preceding Book where she  introduced  Black George  running away with the  l  from his Friend and Benefactor  Those who sat in the World's upper Gallery treated that Incident I am well convinced with their usual Vociferation and every Term of scurrilous Reproach was most probably vented on that Occasion  If we had descended to the next Order of Spectators we should have found an equal Degree of Abhorrence tho' less of Noise and Scurrility yet here the good Women gave  Black George  to the Devil and many of them expected every Minute that the clovenfooted Gentleman would fetch his own  The Pit as usual was no doubt divided Those who delight in heroic Virtue and perfect Character objected to the producing such Instances of Villainy without punishing them very severely for the Sake of Example Some of the Author's Friends cry'd  'Look'e Gentlemen the Man is a Villain but it is Nature for all that'  And all the young Critics of the Age the Clerks Apprentices  c  called it Low and fell a Groaning  As for the Boxes they behaved with their accustomed Politeness Most of them were attending to something else Some of those few who regarded the Scene at all declared he was a bad Kind of Man while others refused to give their opinion 'till they had heard the best Judges  Now we who are admitted behind the Scenes of this great Theatre of Nature and no Author ought to write any Thing besides Dictionaries and SpellingBooks who hath not this Privilege can censure the Action without conceiving any absolute Detestation of the Person whom perhaps Nature may not have designed to act an ill Part in all her Dramas For in this Instance Life most exactly resembles the Stage since it is often the same Person who represents the Villain and the Heroe and he who engages your  Admiration Today will probably attract your Contempt ToMorrow As  Garrick  whom I regard in Tragedy to be the greatest Genius the World hath ever produced sometimes condescends to play the Fool so did  Scipio  the Great and  Laelius  the Wise according to  Horace  many Years ago nay  Cicero  reports them to have been 'incredibly childish'These it is true play'd the Fool like my Friend  Garrick  in Jest only but several eminent Characters have in numberless Instances of their Lives played the Fool egregiously in Earnest so far as to render it a Matter of some Doubt whether their Wisdom or Folly was predominant or whether they were better intitled to the Applause or Censure the Admiration or Contempt the Love or Hatred of Mankind  Those Persons indeed who have passed any Time behind the Scenes of this great Theatre and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the several Disguises which are there put on but also with the fantastic and capricious Behaviour of the Passions who are the Managers and Directors of this Theatre for as to Reason the Patentee he is known to be a very idle Fellow and seldom to exert himself may most probably have learned to construe the famous  Nil admirari  of  Horace  or in the  English  Phrase  To stare at nothing  A single bad Act no more constitutes a Villain in Life than a single bad Part on the Stage The Passions like the Managers of a Playhouse often force Men upon Parts without consulting their Judgment and sometimes without any Regard to their Talents Thus the Man as well as the Player may condemn what he himself acts nay it is common to see Vice sit as awkwardly on some Men as the Character of  Iago  would on the honest Face of Mr  William Mills  Upon the whole then the Man of Candour and of true Understanding is never hasty to condemn He can censure an Imperfection or even a Vice without Rage against the guilty Party In a Word they are the same Folly the same Childishness the same Illbreeding and the same Illnature which raise all the Clamours and Uproars both in Life and on the Stage The worst of Men generally have the Words  Rogue  and  Villain  most in their Mouths as the lowest of all Wretches are the aptest to cry out  low  in the Pit  CHAP II  Containing a Conversation which Mr  Jones  had with himself  JONES  received his Effects from Mr  Allworthy  's early in the Morning with the following Answer to his Letter  SIR  I AM commanded by my Uncle to acquaint you that as he did not proceed to those Measures he hath taken with you without the greatest Deliberation and after the fullest Evidence of your Unworthiness so will it be always out of your Power to cause the least Alteration in his Resolution He expresses great Surprize at your Presumption in saying you have resigned all Pretensions to a young Lady to whom it is impossible you should ever have had any her Birth and Fortune having made her so infinitely your superior Lastly I am commanded to tell you that the only instance of your Compliance with my Uncle's Inclinations which he requires is your immediately quitting this Country I cannot conclude this without offering you my Advice as a Christian that you would seriously  think of amending your Life that you may be assisted with Grace so to do will be always the Prayer of  Your Humble Servant W BLIFIL  Many contending Passions were raised in our Heroe's Mind by this Letter but the Tender prevailed at last over the Indignant and Irascible and a Flood of Tears came seasonably to his Assistance and possibly prevented his Misfortunes from either turning his Head or bursting his Heart  He grew however soon ashamed of indulging this Remedy and starting up he cried  'Well then I will give Mr  Allworthy  the only Instance he requires of my Obedience I will go this Momentbut whitherwhy let Fortune direct since there is no other who thinks it of any Consequence what becomes of this wretched Person it shall be a Matter of equal Indifference to myself Shall I alone regard what no otherHa have I not Reason to think there is anotherOne whose Value is above that of the whole WorldI may I must imagine my  Sophia  is not indifferent to what becomes of me Shall I then leave this only Friendand such a Friend Shall I not stay with herWhere How can I stay with her Have I any Hopes of even seeing her tho' she was as desirous as myself without exposing her to the Wrath of her Father And to what Purpose Can I think of soliciting such a Creature to Consent to her own Ruin Shall I indulge any Passion of mine at such a PriceShall I lurk about this Country like a Thief with such IntentionsNo I disdain I detest the Thought Farewel  Sophia  farewel most lovely most beloved'  Here Passion stopped his Mouth and found a Vent at his Eyes  And now having taken a Resolution to leave the Country he began to debate with himself whither he should go  The World  as  Milton  phrases it  lay all before him  and  Jones  no more than  Adam  had any Man to whom he might resort for Comfort or Assistance All his Acquaintance were the Acquaintance of Mr  Allworthy  and he had no Reason to expect any Countenance from them as that Gentleman had withdrawn his Favour from him Men of great and good Characters should indeed be very cautious how they discard their Dependents for the Consequence to the unhappy Sufferer is being discarded by all others  What Course of Life to pursue or to what Business to apply himself was a second Consideration and here the Prospect was all a melancholy Void Every profession and every Trade required Length of Time and what was worse Money for Matters are so Constituted that 'Nothing out of Nothing' is not a truer Maxim in Physics than in Politics and every Man who is greatly destitute of Money is on that Account entirely excluded from all Means of acquiring it  At last the Ocean that hospitable Friend to the Wretched opened her capacious Arms to receive him and he instantly resolved to accept her kind Invitation To express myself less figuratively he determined to go to Sea  This Thought indeed no sooner suggested itself than he eagerly embraced it and having presently hired Horses he set out for  Bristol  to put it in Execution  But before we attend him on his Expedition we shall resort a while to Mr  Western  's and see what farther happened to the charming  Sophia  CHAP III  Containing several Dialogues  THE Morning in which Mr  Jones  departed Mrs  Western  summoned  Sophia  into her Apartment and having first accquainted her that she had obtained her Liberty of her Father she proceeded to read her a long Lecture on the Subject of Matrimony which she treated not as a romantic Scheme of Happiness arising from Love as it hath been described by the Poets nor did she mention any of those Purposes for which we are taught by Divines to regard it as instituted by sacred Authority she considered it rather as a Fund in which prudent Women deposited their Fortunes to the best Advantage in order to receive a larger Interest for them than they could have elsewhere  When Mrs  Western  had finished  Sophia  answered  'that she was very incapable of arguing with a Lady of her Aunt's superior Knowledge and Experience especially on a Subject which she had so very little considered as this of Matrimony'  'Argue with me Child' replied the other 'I did not indeed expect it I should have seen the World to very little Purpose truly if I am to argue with one of your Years I have taken this Trouble in order to instruct you The ancient Philosophers such as  Socrates Alcibiades  and others did not use to argue with their Scholars You are to consider me Child as  Socrates  not asking your Opinion but only informing you of mine'  From which last Words the Reader may possibly imagine that this Lady had read no more of the Philosophy of  Socrates  than she had of that of  Alcibiades  and indeed we cannot resolve his Curiosity as to this Point  'Madam' cries  Sophia  'I have never presumed to controvert any Opinion of yours and this Subject as I said I have never yet thought of and perhaps never may  'Indeed  Sophy'  replied the Aunt 'this Dissimulation with me is very foolish The  French  shall as soon persuade me that they take foreign Towns in Defence only of their own Country as you can impose on me to believe you have never yet thought seriously of Matrimony How can you Child affect to deny that you have considered of contracting an Alliance when you so well know I am acquainted with the Party with whom you desire to contract it An Alliance as unnatural and contrary to your Interest as a separate League with the  French  would be to the Interest of the  Dutch  But however if you have not hitherto considered of this Matter I promise you it is now high Time for my Brother is resolved immediately to conclude the Treaty with Mr  Blifil  and indeed I am a sort of Guarantee in the Affair and have promised your Concurrence  'Indeed Madam' cries  Sophia  'this is the only Instance in which I must disobey both yourself and my Father For this is a Match which requires very little Consideration in me to refuse'  'If I was not as great a Philosopher as  Socrates  himself' returned Mrs  Western  'you would overcome my Patience What Objection can you have to the young Gentleman  'A very solid Objection in my Opinion' says  Sophia'  I hate him'  'Will you never learn a proper Use of Words' answered the Aunt 'Indeed Child you should consult  Bailey  's  Dictionary  It is impossible you should hate a Man from whom you have received no Injury By Hatred therefore you mean no more than Dislike which is no sufficient Objection against  marrying of him I have known many Couples who have entirely disliked each other lead very comfortable genteel lives Believe me Child I know these Things better than you You will allow me I think to have seen the World in which I have not an Acquaintance who would not rather be thought to dislike her Husband than to like him The contrary is such outofFashion romantic Nonsense that the very imagination of it is shocking  'Indeed Madam' replied  Sophia  'I shall never marry a Man I dislike If I promise my Father never to consent to any Marriage contrary to his Inclinations I think I may hope he will never force me into that State contrary to my own  'Inclinations' cries the Aunt with some Warmth 'Inclinations I am astonished at your assurance A young Woman of your Age and unmarried to talk of Inclinations But whatever your Inclinations may be my Brothar is resolved nay since you talk of Inclinations I shall advise him to hasten the Treaty Inclinations  Sophia  then flung herself upon her Knees and Tears began to trickle from her shining Eyes She entreated her Aunt  'to have Mercy upon her and not to resent so cruelly her Unwillingness to make herself miserable often urging that she alone was concerned and that her Happiness only was at Stake'  As a Bailiff when well authorised by his Writ having possessed himself of the Person of some unhappy Debtor views all his Tears without concern In vain the wretched Captive attempts to raise Compassion in vain the tender Wife bereft of her Companion the little prattling Boy or frighted Girl are mentioned as inducements to Reluctance The noble Bumtrap blind and deaf to every Circumstance of Distress greatly rises above all the Motives to Humanity  and into the Hands of the Goaler resolves to deliver his miserable Prey  Not less blind to the Tears or less deaf to every Entreaty of  Sophia  was the politic Aunt nor less determined was she to deliver over the trembling Maid into the Arms of the Goaler  Blifil  She answered with great Impetuosity  'So far Madam from your being concerned alone your concern is the least or surely the least important It is the Honour of your Family which is concerned in this Alliance you are only the Instrument Do you conceive Mistress that in an Intermarriage between Kingdoms as when a Daughter of  France  is married into  Spain  that the Princess herself is alone considered in the Match No it is a match between two Kingdoms rather than between two Persons The same happens in great Families such as ours The Alliance between the Families is the Principal Matter You ought to have a greater Regard for the Honour of your Family than for your own Person and if the Example of a Princess cannot inspire you with these noble Thoughts you cannot surely complain at being used no worse than all Princesses are used  'I hope Madam' cries  Sophia  with a little Elevation of Voice 'I shall never do any Thing to dishonour my Family but as for Mr  Blifil  whatever may be the Consequence I am resolved against him and no Force shall prevail in his Favour  Western  who had been within hearing during the greater Part of the preceding Dialogue had now exhausted all his Patience he therefore entered the Room in a violent Passion crying  'Dn me then if  shatunt  ha' un dn me if  shatunt  that's allthat's allDn me if  shatunt  Mrs  Western  had collected a sufficient Quantity of Wrath for the Use of  Sophia  but she now transfered it all to the Squire  'Brother' said she 'it is  astonishing that you will interfere in a Matter which you had totally left to my Negotiation Regard to my Family hath made me take upon myself to be the mediating Power in order to rectify those mistakes in Policy which you have committed in your Daughter's Education For Brother it is you it is your preposterous Conduct which hath eradicated all the Seeds that I had formerly sown in her tender MindIt is yourself who have taught her Disobedience'    'Blood' cries the Squire foaming at the Mouth 'you are enough to conquer the Patience of the Devil Have I ever taught my Daughter DisobedienceHere she stands Speak honestly Girl did ever I bid you be disobedient to me Have I not done every thing to humour and to gratify you and to make you obedient to me And very obedient to me she was when a little Child before you took her in Hand and spoiled her by filling her Head with a Pack of Court NotionsWhywhywhydid not I overhear you telling her she must behave like a Princess You have made a Whig of the Girl and how should her Father or any body else expect any Obedience from her'  'Brother' answered Mrs  Western  with an Air of great disdain 'I cannot express the Contempt I have for your Politics of all Kinds but I will appeal likewise to the young Lady herself whether I have ever taught her any Principles of Disobedience On the contrary Niece have I not endeavoured to inspire you with a true Idea of the several Relations in which a human Creature stands in Society Have I not taken infinite Pains to shew you that the Law of Nature hath enjoined a Duty on Children to their Parents Have I not told you what  Plato  says on that SubjectA Subject on which you was so notoriously ignorant when you came first under my Care that I verily believe you did not know the Relation between a Daughter and a Father'  ' 'Tis  Lie' answered  Western  'The Girl is no such Fool as to live to eleven Years old without knowing that she was her Father's Relation'  'O more than Gothic Ignorance' answered the Lady 'And as for your Manners Brother I must tell you they deserve a Cane'  'Why then you may gi' it me if you think you are able' cries the Squire 'nay I suppose your Niece there will be ready enough to help you'  'Brother' said Mrs  Western  'tho' I dispise you beyond Expression yet I shall endure your Insolence no longer so I desire my Coach may be got ready immediately for I am resolved to leave your House this very Morning'  'And a good Riddance too' answered he 'I can bear your Insolence no longer an you come to that Blood it is almost enough of itself to make my Daughter undervalue my Sense when she hears you telling me every Minute you despise me'  'It is impossible it is impossible' cries the Aunt 'no one can undervalue such a Boor  Boar' answered the Squire 'I am no Boar no nor Ass no nor Rat neither Madam Remember thatI am no Rat I am a ture  Englishman  and not of your  Hanover  Breed that have eat up the Nation  Thou art one of those wise Men' cries she 'whose nonsensical Principles have undone the Nation by weakening the Hands of our Government at home and by discouraging our Friends and encouraging our Enemies abroad'  'Ho are you come back to your Politics' cries the Squire 'as for those I despise them as much as I do a Ft  Which last Words he accompanied and graced with the very Action which of all others was the most proper to it And whether it was this Word or the Contempt exprest for her Politics which most affected Mrs  Western  I will not determine but she flew into the most violent Rage uttered Phrases improper to be here related and instantly burst out of the House  Nor did her Brother or her Niece think proper either to stop or to follow her For the one was so much possessed by Concern and the other by Anger that they were rendered almost motionless  The Squire however sent after his Sister the same Holla which attends the Departure of a Hare when she is first started before the Hounds He was indeed a great Master of this Kind of Vociferation and had a Holla proper for most Occasions in Life  Women who like Mrs  Western  know the World and have applied themselves to Philosophy and Politics would have immediately availed themselves of the present Disposition of Mr  Western  's Mind by throwing in a few artful Compliments to his Understanding at the Expence of his absent Adversary but poor  Sophia  was all Simplicity By which Word we do not intend to insinuate to the Reader that she was silly which is generally understood as a synonimous Term with simple For she was indeed a most sensible Girl and her Understanding was of the first Rate but she wanted all that useful Art which Females convert to so many good Purposes in Life and which as it rather arises from the Heart than from the Head is often the Property of the silliest of Women  CHAP IV  A Picture of a Country Gentlewoman taken from th  Life  MR  Western  having finished his Holla and taken a little Breath began to lament in very pathetic Terms the unfortunate Condition of Men who are says he always  whipt in  by the Humours of some dnd Bor other I think I was  hard run  enough by your Mother for one Man but after giving her a  Dodge  here's another Bfollows me upon the  Foil  but curse my Jacket if I will be  run down  in this Manner by any o'um  Sophia  never had a single Dispute with her Father till this unlucky Affair of  Blifil  on any Account except in Defence of her Mother whom she had loved most tenderly though she lost her in the eleventh Year of her Age The Squire to whom that poor Woman had been a faithful upper Servant all the Time of their Marriage had returned that Behaviour by making what the World calls a good Husband He very seldom swore at her perhaps not above once a Week and never beat her She had not the least Occasion for Jealousy and was perfect Mistress of her Time for she was never interrupted by her Husband who was engaged all the Morning in his Field Exercises and all the Evening with BottleCompanions She scarce indeed ever saw him but at Meals where she had the Pleasure of carving those Dishes which she had before attended at the Dressing From these Meals she retired about five Minutes after the other Servants having only stayed to drink the King over the Water Such were it seems Mr  Western  's Orders For it was a Maxim with him that Women should come in with the first Dish and go out after the first Glass Obedience to these Orders was perhaps no difficult Task For the Conversation if it may be called so was seldom such as could entertain a Lady It consisted chiefly of Hollowing Singing Relations of sporting Adventures Bdy and Abuse of Women and of the Government  These however were the only Seasons when Mr  Western  saw his Wife For when he repaired to her Bed he was generally so drunk that he could not see and in the sporting Season he always rose from her before it was light Thus was she perfect Mistress of her Time and had besides a Coach and four usually at her Command tho' unhappily indeed the Badness of the Neighbourhood and of the Roads made this of little Use For none who had set much Value on  their Necks would have passed through the one or who had set any Value on their Hours would have visited the other Now to deal honestly with the Reader she did not make all the Return expected to so much Indulgence For she had been married against her Will by a fond Father the Match having been rather advantageous on her Side For the Squire's Estate was upwards of  l  a Year and her Fortune no more than a bare  l  Hence perhaps she had contracted a little Gloominess of Temper For she was rather a good Servant than a good Wife nor had she always the Gratitude to return the extraordinary Degree of roaring Mirth with which the Squire received her even with a good humoured Smile She would moreover sometimes interfere with Matters which did not concern her as the violent Drinking of her Husband which in the gentlest Terms she would take some of the few Opportunities he gave her of remonstrating against And once in her Life she very earnestly entreated him to carry her for two Months to  London  which he peremptorily denied nay was angry with his Wife for the Request ever after being well assured that all the Husbands in  London  are Cuckolds  For this last and many other good Reasons  Western  at length heartily hated his Wife and this Hatred as he never concealed before her Death so he never forgot it afterwards but when any Thing in the least soured him as a bad scenting Day or a Distemper among his Hounds or any other such Misfortune he constantly vented his Spleen by Invectives against the Deceased saying  'If my Wife was alive now she would be glad of this'  These Invectives he was especially desirous of throwing forth before  Sophia  For as he loved her more than he did any other so he was really jealous that she had loved her Mother better than him And this Jealousy  Sophia  seldom failed of heightening  on these Occasions For he was not contented with violating her Ears with the Abuse of her Mother but endeavoured to force an explicit Approbation of all this Abuse with which Desire he never could prevail upon her by any Promise or Threats to comply  Hence some of my Readers will perhaps wonder that the Squire had not hated  Sophia  as much as he had hated her Mother but I must inform them that Hatred is not the Effect of Love even through the Medium of Jealousy It is indeed very possible for jealous Persons to kill the Objects of their Jealousy but not to hate them Which Sentiment being a pretty hard Morsel and bearing something of the Air of a Paradox we shall leave the Reader to chew the Cud upon it to the End of the Chapter  CHAP V  The generous Behaviour of  Sophia  towards her Aunt  SOPHIA  kept Silence during the foregoing Speech of her Father nor did she once answer otherwise than with a Sigh but as he understood none of the Language or as he called it Lingo of the Eyes so he was not satisfied without some further Approbation of his Sentiments which he now demanded in the usual Way of his Daughter telling her  'he expected she was ready to take the Part of every Body against him as she had always done that of the Bher Mother'  Sophia  remaining still silent he cry'd out  'What art dumb why dost unt speak Was not thy Mother a dd Bto me Answer me that What I suppose you despise your Father too and don't think him good enough to speak to'  'For Heavn's Sake Sir' answered  Sophia  'do not give so cruel a Turn to my Silence I am sure I would sooner die than be guilty of any Disrespect  towards you but how can I venture to speak when every Word must either offend my dear Papa or convict me of the blackest Ingratitude as well as Impiety to the Memory of the best of Mothers For such I am certain my Mamma was always to me'  'And your Aunt I suppose is the best of Sisters too' replied the Squire 'Will you be so kind as to allow that she is a B I may fairly insist upon that I think'  'Indeed Sir' says  Sophia  'I have great Obligations to my Aunt She hath been a second Mother to me'  'And a second Wife to me too' returned  Western  'so you will take her Part too You won't confess that she hath acted the Part of the vilest Sister in the World'  'Upon my Word Sir' cries  Sophia  'I must belie my Heart wickedly if I did I know my Aunt and you differ very much in your Ways of thinking but I have heard her a thousand Times express the greatest Affection for you and I am convinced so far from her being the worst Sister in the World there are very few who love a Brother better'  'The  English  of all which is' answered the Squire 'that I am in the wrong Ay certainly Ay to be sure the Woman is in the Right and the Man in the Wrong always'  'Pardon me Sir' cries  Sophia  'I do not say so'  'What don't you say' answered the Father 'you have the Impudence to say she's in the Right doth it not follow then of Course that I'm in the wrong And perhaps I am in the wrong to suffer such a Presbyterian  Hanoverian  Bto come into my House She may 'dite me of a Plot for any Thing I know and give my Estate to the Government'  'So far Sir from injuring you or your Estate' says  Sophia  'if my Aunt had died Yesterday I am convinced she would have left you her whole Fortune'  Whether  Sophia  intended it or no I shall not presume to assert but certain it is these last Words penetrated very deep into the Ears of her Father and produced a much more sensible Effect than all she had said before He received the Sound with much the same Action as a Man receives a Bullet in his Head He started staggered and turned pale After which he remained silent above a Minute and then began in the following hesitating Manner  'Yesterday she would have left me her Esteate Yesterday would she Why Yesterday of all the Days in the Year I suppose if she dies Tomorrow she will leave it to somebody else and perhaps out of the Vamily'  'My Aunt Sir' cries  Sophia  'hath very violent Passions and I can't answer what she may do under their Influence'  'You can't returned the Father 'and pray who hath been the Occasion of putting her into those violent Passions Nay who hath actually put her into them Was not you and she hard at it before I came into the Room Besides was not all our Quarrel about you I have not quarreled with Sister these many Years but upon your Account and now you would throw the whole Blame upon me as thof I should be the Occasion of her leaving her Esteate out o' the Vamily I could have expected no better indeed this is like the Return you make to all the rest of my Fondness'  'I beseech you then' cries  Sophia  'upon my Knees I beseech you if I have been the unhappy Occasion of this Difference that you will endeavour to make it up with my Aunt and not suffer her to leave your House in this violent Rage of Anger She is a very goodnatured Woman and  a few civil Words will satisfy herLet me intreat you Sir'  'So I must go and ask Pardon for your Fault must I' answered  Western  'You have lost the Hare and I must draw every Way to find her again Indeed if I was certain'  Here he stopt and  Sophia  throwing in more Entreaties at length prevailed upon him and after venting two or three bitter sarcastical Expressions against his Daughter he departed as fast as he could to recover his Sister before her Equipage could be gotten ready  Sophia  then retired to her Chamber of Mourning where she indulged herself if the Phrase may be allowed me in all the Luxury of tender Grief She read over the Letter which she had received from  Jones  more than once her Muff too was used on this Occasion and she bathed both these as well as herself with her Tears In this Situation the friendly Mrs  Honour  exerted her utmost Abilities to comfort her afflicted Mistress She ran over the Names of many young Gentlemen and having greatly commended their Parts and Persons assured  Sophia  that she might take her choice of any These Methods must have certainly been used with some Success in Disorders of the like Kind or so skilful a Practitioner as Mrs  Honour  would never have ventured to apply them nay I have heard that the College of Chambermaids hold them to be as sovereign Remedies as any in the female Dispensary but whether it was that  Sophia  's Disease differed inwardly from those Cases with which it agreed in external Symptoms I will not assert but in Fact the good Waitingwoman did more Harm than Good and at last so incensed her Mistress which was no easy Matter that with an angry Voice she dismissed her from her Presence  CHAP VI  Containing great Variety of Matter  THE Squire overtook his Sister just as she was stepping into the Coach and partly by Force and partly by Solicitations prevailed upon her to order her Horses back into their Quarters He succeeded in this Attempt without much Difficulty For the Lady was as we have already hinted of a most placable Disposition and greatly loved her Brother tho' she despised his Parts or rather his little Knowledge of the World  Poor  Sophia  who had first set on Foot this Reconciliation was now made the Sacrifice to it They both concurred in their Censures on her Conduct jointly declared War against her and directly proceeded to Council how to carry it on in the most vigorous Manner For this Purpose Mrs  Western  proposed not only an immediate Conclusion of the Treaty with  Allworthy  but as immediately to carry it into Execution saying  'That there was no other Way to succeed with her Niece but by violent Methods which she was convinced  Sophia  had not sufficient Resolution to resist 'By violent says she 'I mean rather hasty Measures For as to Confinement or absolute Force no such Things must or can be attempted Our Plan must be concerted for a Surprize and not for a Storm'  These Matters were resolved on when Mr  Blifil  came to pay a Visit to his Mistress The Squire no sooner heard of his Arrival than he stept aside by his Sister's Advice to give his Daughter Orders for the proper Reception of her Lover which he did with the most bitter Execrations and Denunciations of of Judgment on her Refusal  The Impetuosity of the Squire bore down all before him and  Sophia  as her Aunt very wisely foresaw  was not able to resist him She agreed therefore to see  Blifil  tho' she had scarce Spirits or Strength sufficient to utter her Assent Indeed to give a peremtory Denial to a Father whom she so tenderly loved was no easy Task Had this Circumstance been out of the Case much less Resolution than what she was really Mistress of would perhaps have served her but it is no unusual Thing to ascribe those Actions entirely to Fear which are in a great Measure produced by Love  In Pursuance therefore of her Father's peremptory Command  Sophia  now admitted Mr  Blifil  's Visit Scenes like this when painted at large afford as we have observed very little Entertainment to the Reader Here therefore we shall strictly adhere to a Rule of  Horace  by which Writers are directed to pass over all those Matters which they despair of placing in a shining Light A Rule we conceive of excellent Use as well to the Historian as to the Poet and which if followed must at least have this good Effect that many a great Evil for so all great Books are called would thus be reduced to a small one  It is possible the great Art used by  Blifil  at this Interview would have prevailed on  Sophia  to have made another Man in his Circumstances her Confident and to have revealed the whole Secret of her Heart to him but she had contracted so ill an Opinion of this young Gentleman that she was resolved to place no Confidence in him For Simplicity when set on it's Guard is often a Match for Cunning Her Behaviour to him therefore was entirely forced and indeed such as is generally prescribed to Virgins upon the second formal Visit from one who is appointed for their Husband  But tho'  Blifil  declared himself perfectly satisfied with his Reception to the Squire yet that Gentleman who in Company with his Sister had overheard all  was not so well pleased He resolved in Pursuance of the Advice of the sage Lady to push Matters as forward as possible and addressing himself to his intended SoninLaw in the hunting Phrase he cry'd after a loud Holla  'Follow her Boy follow her run in run in that's it Honeys Dead dead deadNever be bashful nor stand shall I shall I  Allworthy  and I can finish all Matters between us this Afternoon and let us ha' the Wedding Tomorrow  Blifil  having conveyed the utmost Satisfaction into his Countenance answered  'As there is nothing Sir in this World which I so eagerly desire as an Alliance with your Family except my Union with the most amiable and deserving  Sophia  you may easily imagine how impatient I must be to see myself in Possession of my two highest Wishes If I have not therefore importuned you on this Head you will impute it only to my Fear of offending the Lady by endeavouring to hurry on so blessed an Event faster than a strict Compliance with all the Rules of Decency and Decorum will permit But if by your Interest Sir she might be induced to dispence with any Formalities'  'Formalities with a Pox' answered the Squire 'Pooh all Stuff and Nonsense I tell thee she shall ha' thee Tomorrow you will know the World better hereafter when you come to my Age Women never gi' their Consent Man if they can help it 'tis not the Fashion If I had staid for her Momother's Consent I might have been a Batchelor to this DayTo her to her to her that's it you jolly Dog I tell thee shat ha' her Tomorrow Morning'  Blifil  suffered himself to be overpowered by the forcible Rhetoric of the Squire and it being agreed that  Western  should close with  Allworthy  that very Afternoon the Lover departed home having first  earnestly begged that no Violence might be offered to the Lady by this Haste in the same Manner as a Popish Inquisitor begs the Lay Power to do no Violence to the Heretic delivered over to it and against whom the Church hath passed Sentence  And to say the Truth  Blifil  had passed Sentence against  Sophia  for however pleased he had declared himself to  Western  with his Reception he was by no means satisfied unless it was that he was satisfied of the Hatred and Scorn of his Mistress and this had produced no less reciprocal Hatred and Scorn in him It may perhaps be asked Why then did he not put an immediate End to all further Courtship I answer for that very Reason as well as for several others equally good which we shall now proceed to open to the Reader  Tho' Mr  Blifil  was not of the Complexion of  Jones  nor ready to eat every Woman he saw yet he was far from being destitute of that Appetite which is said to be the common Property of Animals With this he had the distinguishing Taste which serves to direct Men in their Choice of the Objects or Food of their several Appetites and this taught him to consider  Sophia  as a most delicious Morsel indeed to regard her with the same Desires which an Ortolan inspires into the Soul on Epicure Now the Agonies which affected the Mind of  Sophia  rather augmented than impaired her Beauty for her Tears added Brightness to her Eyes and her Breasts rose higher with her Sighs Indeed no one hath seen Beauty in its highest Lustre who hath never seen it in Distress  Blifil  therefore looked on this human Ortolan with greater Desire than when he had viewed her last nor was his Desire at all lessened by the Aversion which he discovered in her to himself On the contrary this served rather to heighten the Pleasure he proposed in rifling her Charms as it added Triumph to Lust nay he had some further Views from obtaining the absolute Possession of her Person which we detest too  much even to mention and Revenge itself was not without its Share in the Gratifications which he promised himself the rivalling poor  Jones  and supplanting him in her Affections added another Spur to his Pursuit and promised another additional Rapture to his Enjoyment  Besides all these Views which to some scrupulous Persons may seem to savour too much of Malevolence he had one Prospect which few Readers will regard with any great Abhorrence And this was the Estate of Mr  Western  which was all to be settled on his Daughter and her Issue for so extravagant was the Affection of that fond Parent that provided his Child would but consent to be miserable with the Husband he chose he cared not at what Price he purchased him  For these Reasons Mr  Blifil  was so desirous of the Match that he intended to deceive  Sophia  by pretending Love to her and to deceive her Father and his own Uncle by pretending he was beloved by her In doing this he availed himself of the Piety of  Thwackum  who held that if the End proposed was religious as surely Matrimony is it mattered not how wicked were the Means As to other Occasions he used to apply the Philosophy of  Square  which taught that the End was immaterial so that the Means were fair and consistent with moral Rectitude To say Truth there were few Occurrences in Life on which he could not draw Advantantage from the Precepts of one or other of those great Masters  Little Deceit was indeed necessary to be practised on Mr  Western  who thought the Inclinations of his Daughter of as little Consequence as  Blifil  himself conceived them to be but as the Sentiments of Mr  Allworthy  were of a very different Kind so it was absolutely necessary to impose on him In this however  Blifil  was so well assisted by  Western  that he succeeded without Difficulty For as Mr  Allworthy  had been assured by her Father that  Sophia  had a  proper Affection for  Blifil  and that all which he had suspected concerning  Jones  was entirely false  Blifil  had nothing more to do than to confirm these Assertions which he did with such Equivocations that he preserved a Salvo for his Conscience and had the Satisfaction of conveying a Lie to his Uncle without the Guilt of telling one When he was examined touching the Inclinations of  Sophia  by  Allworthy  who said  'he would on no Account be accessary to the forcing a young Lady into a Marriage contrary to her own Will'  he answered  'That the real Sentiments of young Ladies were very difficult to be understood that her Behaviour to him was full as forward as he wished it and that if he could believe her Father she had all the Affection for him which any Lover could desire As for  Jones'  said he 'whom I am loth to call Villain tho' his Behaviour to you Sir sufficiently justifies the Appellation his own Vanity or perhaps some wicked Views might make him boast of a Falshood for if there had been any Reality in Miss  Western  's Love to him the Greatness of her Fortune would never have suffered him to desert her as you are well informed he hath Lastly Sir I promise you I would not myself for any Consideration no not for the whole World consent to marry this young Lady if I was not persuaded she had all the Passion for me which I desire she should have  This excellent Method of conveying a Falshood with the Heart only without making the Tongue guilty of an Untruth by the Means of Equivocation and Imposture hath quieted the Conscience of many a notable Deceiver and yet when we consider that it is Omniscience on which these endeavour to impose it may possibly seem capable only of affording a very superficial Comfort and that this artful and refined Distinction between communicating a Lie  and telling one is hardly worth the Pains it costs them  Allworthy  was pretty well satisfied with what Mr  Western  and Mr  Blifil  told him and the Treaty was now at the End of two Days concluded Nothing then remained previous to the Office of the Priest but the Office of the Lawyers which threatened to take up so much Time that  Western  offered to bind himself by all Manner of Covenants rather than to defer the Happiness of the young Couple Indeed he was so very earnest and pressing that an indifferent Person might have concluded he was more a Principal in this Match than he really was But this Eagerness was natural to him on all Occasions and he conducted every Scheme he undertook in such a Manner as if the Success of that alone was sufficient to constitute the whole Happiness of his Life  The joint Importunities of both Father and Soninlaw would probably have prevailed on Mr  Allworthy  who brooked but ill any Delay of giving Happiness to others had not  Sophia  herself prevented it and taken Measures to put a final End to the whole Treaty and to rob both Church and Law of those Taxes which these wise Bodies have thought proper to receive from the Propagation of the human Species in a lawful Manner Of which in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  A strange Resolution of  Sophia  and a more strange Stratagem of Mrs Honour  THO' Mrs  Honour  was principally attached to her Interest she was not without some little Attachment to  Sophia  To say Truth it was very difficult for any one to know that young Lady without loving her She no sooner therefore heard a  Piece of News which she imagined to be of great Importance to her Mistress than quite forgetting the Anger which she had conceived two Days before at her unpleasant Dismission from  Sophia  's Presence she ran hastily to inform her of this News  The Beginning of her Discourse was as abrupt as her Entrance into the Room  'O dear Ma'am' says she 'what doth your La'ship think To be sure I am frightened out of my Wits and yet I thought it my Duty to tell your La'ship tho' perhaps it may make you angry for we Servants don't always know what will make our Ladies angry for to be sure every thing is always laid to the Charge of a Servant When our Ladies are out of Humour to be sure we must be scolded and to be sure I should not wonder if your La'ship should be out of Humour nay it must surprize you certainly ay and shock you too'    'Good  Honour  let me know it without any longer Preface' says  Sophia  'there are few Things I promise you which will surprize and fewer which will shock me'  Dear Ma'am answered ed  Honour  'to be sure I overheard my Master talking to Parson  Supple  about getting a Licence this very Afternoon and to be sure I heard him say your La'ship should be married Tomarrow Morning'  Sophia  turned pale at these Words and repeated eagerly  'Tomorrow Morning    Yes Madam' replied the trusty Waitingwoman 'I will take my Oath I heard my Master say so'  Honour'  says  Sophia  'you have both surprized and shocked me to such a Degree that I have scarce any Breath or Spirit left What is to be done in my dreadful Situation'  I wish I was able to advise your La'ship' says she  'Do advise me' cries  Sophia  'pray dear  Honour  advise me Think what you would attempt if it was your own Case  Indeed Ma'am' cries  Honour  'I wish your La'ship and I could change Situations that is I mean without hurting your La'ship  for to be sure I don't wish you so bad as to be a Servant but because that if so be it was my Case I should find no Manner of Difficulty in it for in my poor Opinion young Squire  Blifil  is a charming sweet handsome Man'    'Don't mention such Stuff'  cries  Sophia'    Such Stuff' repeated  Honour  'why thereWell to be sure what's one Man's Meat is another Man's Poison and the same is altogether as true of Women'  Honour'  says  Sophia  'rather than Submit to be the Wife of that contemptible Wretch I would plunge a Dagger into my Heart'  'O lud Ma'am' answered the other 'I am sure you frighten me out of my Wits now Let me beseech your La'ship not to suffer such wicked Thoughts to come into your Head O lud to be sure I tremble every Inch of me Dear Ma'am considerthat to be denied Christian Burial and to have your Corpse buried in the Highway and a Stake drove through you as Farmer  Halfpenny  was served at  OxCross  and to be sure his Ghost hath walked there ever since for several People have seen him To be sure it can be nothing but the Devil which can put such wicked Thoughts into the Head of any body for certainly it is less wicked to hurt all the World than one's own dear Self and so I have heard said by more Parsons than one If your La'ship hath such a violent Aversion and hates the young Gentleman so very bad that you can't bear to think of going into Bed to him for to be sure there may be such Antipathies in Nature and one had lieverer touch a Toad than the Flesh of some People  Sophia  had been too much wraped in Contemplation to pay any great Attention to the foregoing excellent Discourse of her Maid interrupting her therefore without making any answer to it she said  '  Honour  I am come to a Resolution I am determined to leave my Father's House this very Night  and if you have the Friendship for me which you have often professed you will keep me Company'  'That I will Ma'am to the World's End' answered  Honour  'but I beg your La'ship to consider the Consequence before you undertake any rash Action Where can your La'ship possibly go'  'There is' replied  Sophia  'a Lady of Quality in  London  a Relation of mine who spent several Months with my Aunt in the Country during all which Time she treated me with great Kindness and expressed so much Pleasure in my Company that she earnestly desired my Aunt to suffer me to go with her to  London  As she is a Woman of very great Note I shall easily find her out and I make no Doubt of being very well and kindly received by her'  'I would not have your La'ship too confident of that' cries  Honour  'for the first Lady I lived with used to invite People very earnestly to her House but if she heard afterwards they were coming she used to get out of the Way Besides tho' this Lady would be very glad to see your La'ship as to be sure any body would be glad to see your La'ship yet when she hears your La'ship is run away from my Master'    'You are mistaken  Honour'  says  Sophia  'she looks upon the Authority of a Father in a much lower Light than I do for she pressed me violently to go to  London  with her and when I refused to go without my Father's Consent she laughed me to Scorn called me silly Country Girl and said I should make a pure loving Wife since I could be so dutiful a Daughter So I have no Doubt but she will both receive me and protect me too till my Father finding me out of his Power can be brought to some Reason'  'Well but Ma'am' answered  Honour  'how doth your La'ship think of making your Escape Where will you get any Horses or Conveyance for as for your own Horse as all the Servants know a little  how Matters stand between my Master and your La'ship  Robin  will be hanged before he will suffer it to go out of the Stable without my Master's express Orders'  'I intend to escape' said  Sophia  by walking out of the Doors when they are open I thank Heaven my Legs are very able to carry me They have supported me many a long Evening after a Fiddle with no very agreeable Partner and surely they will assist me in running from so detestable a Partner for Life'  'O Heavens Ma'am doth your La'ship know what you are saying' cries  Honour  'would you think of walking about the Country by Night and alone'  'Not alone' answered the Lady 'you have promised to bear me Company'  'Yes to be sure' cries  Honour  'I will follow your La'ship through the World but your La'ship had almost as good be alone for I shall not be able to defend you if any Robbers or other Villians should meet with you Nay I should be in as horrible a Fright as your La'ship for to be certain they would ravish us both Besides Ma'am consider how cold the Nights are now we shall be frozen to Death'  'A good brisk Pace' answered  Sophia  'will preserve us from the Cold and if you cannot defend me from a Villain  Honour  I will defend you for I will take a Pistol with me There are two always charged in the Hall'  'Dear Ma'am you frighten me more and more' cries  Honour  'sure your La'ship would not venture to fire it off I had rather run any Chance than your La'ship should do that'  'Why so' says  Sophia  'smiling would not you  Honour  fire a Pistol at any one who should attack your Virtue'  To be sure Ma'am' cries  Honour  'one's Virtue is a dear Thing especially to us poor Servants for it is our Livelihoood as a Body may say yet I mortally hate Firearms for so many Accidents happen by them'  'Well well'  says  Sophia  'I believe I may ensure your Virtue at a very cheap Rate without carrying any Arms with us for I intend to take Horses at the very first Town we come to and we shall hardly be attacked in our Way thither Look'ee  Honour  I am resolved to go and if you will attend me I promise you I will reward you to the very utmost of my Power'  This last Argument had a stronger Effect on  Honour  than all the preceding And since she saw her Mistress so determined she desisted from any further Dissuasions They then entered into a Debate on Ways and Means of executing their Project Here a very stubborn Difficulty occurred and this was the Removal of their Effects which was much more easily got over by the Mistress than by the Maid For when a Lady hath once taken a Resolution to run to a Lover or to run from him all Obstacles are considered as Trifles But  Honour  was inspired by no such Motive she had no Raptures to expect nor any Terrors to shun and besides the real Value of her Clothes i  which consisted great Part of her Fortune she had a capricious Fondness for several Gowns and other Things either because they became her or because they were given her by such a particular Person because she had brought them lately or because she had had them long or for some other Reasons equally good so that she could not endure the Thought of leaving the poor Things behind her exposed to the Mercy of  Western  who she doubted not would make them suffer Martyrdom in his Rage  The ingenious Mrs  Honour  having applied all her Oratory to dissuade her Mistress from her Purpose when the found her positively determined at last started the following Expedient to remove her Clothes  viz  to get herself turned out of Doors that very Evening  Sophia  highly approved this Method but doubted how it might be brought about  'Oh Ma'am'  cries  Honour  'your La'ship may trust that to me we Servants very well know how to obtain this Favour of our Masters and Mistresses tho' sometimes indeed where they owe us more Wages than they can readily pay they will put up with all our Affronts and will hardly take any Warning we can give them but the Squire is none of those and since your La'ship is resolved upon setting out to Night I warrant I get discharged this Afternoon'  It was then resolved that she should pack up some Linnen and a Nightgown for  Sophia  with her own Things and as for all her other Clothes the young Lady abandoned them with no more Remorse than the Sailor feels when he throws over the Goods of others in order to save his own Life  CHAP VIII  Containing Scenes of Altercation of no very uncommon Kind  MRS  Honour  had scarce sooner parted from her young Lady than something for I would not like the old Woman in  Quivedo  injure the Devil by any false Accusation and possibly he might have no Hand in it but something I say suggested to her that by sacrificing  Sophia  and all her Secrets to Mr  Western  she might probably make her Fortune Many Considerations urged this Discovery The fair Prospect of a handsome Reward for so great and acceptable a Service to the Squire tempted her Avarice and again the Danger of the Enterprize she had undertaken the Incertainty of its Success Night Cold Robbers Ravishers all alarmed her Fears So forcibly did all these operate upon her that she was almost determined to go directly to the Squire and to lay open the whole Affair She was however too upright a Judge to decree on one Side before she had heard the other And here first a Journey to  London  appeared very strongly in Support of  Sophia  She  eagerly longed to see a Place in which she fancied Charms short only of those which a raptured Saint imagines in Heaven In the next Place as she knew  Sophia  to have much more Generosity than her Master so her Fidelity promised her a greater Reward than she could gain by Treachery She then crossexamined all the Articles which had raised her Fears on the other Side and found on fairly sifting the Matter that there was very little in them And now both Scales being reduced to a pretty even Ballance her Love to her Mistress being thrown into the Scale of her Integrity made that rather preponderate when a Circumstance struck upon her Imagination which might have had a dangerous Effect had its whole Weight been fairly put into the other Scale This was the Length of Time which must intervene before  Sophia  would be able to fulfil her Promise for tho' she was intitled to her Mother's Fortune at the Death of her Father and to the Sum of  l  left her by an Uncle when she came of Age yet these were distant Days and many Accidents might prevent the intended Generosity of the young Lady whereas the Rewards she might expect from Mr  Western  were immediate But while she was pursuing this Thought the good Genius of  Sophia  or that which presided over the Integrity of Mrs  Honour  or perhaps mere Chance sent an Accident in her Way which at once preserved her Fidelity and even facilitated their intended Business  Mrs  Western  's Maid claimed great Superiority over Mrs  Honour  on several Accounts First her Birth was higher For her great Grandmother by the Mother's Side was a Cousin not far removed to an  Irish  Peer Secondly her Wages were greater And lastly she had been at  London  and had of Consequence seen more of the World She had always behaved therefore to Mrs  Honour  with that Reserve and had always exacted of her those Marks of Distinction which every Order of Females preserve and require in  Conversation with those of an inferior Order Now as  Honour  did not at all Times agree with this Doctrine but would frequently break in upon the Respect which the other demanded Mrs  Western  's Maid was not at all pleased with her Company Indeed she earnestly longed to return home to the House of her Mistress where she domineered at Will over all the other Servants She had been greatly therefore disappointed in the Morning when Mrs  Western  had changed her Mind on the very Point of Departure and had been in what is vulgarly called a glouting Humour ever since  In this Humour which was none of the sweetest she came into the Room where  Honour  was debating with herself in the Manner we have above related  Honour  no sooner saw her than she addressed her in the following obliging Phrase  'Soh Madam I find we are to have the Pleasure of your Company longer which I was afraid the Quarrel between my Master and your Lady would have robbed us of'  'I don't know Madam' answered the other 'who you mean by We and Us I assure you I do not look on any of the Servants in this House to be proper Company for me I am Company I hope for their Betters every Day in the Week I do not speak on your Account Mrs  Honour  for you are a civilized young Woman and when you have seen a little more of the World I should not be ashamed to walk with you in  St James  's Park'  'Hoity toity' cries  Honour  Madam is in her Airs I protest Mrs  Honour  forsooth sure Madam you might call me by my Sirname for tho' my Lady calls me  Honour  I have a Sirname as well as other Folks Ashamed to walk with me quotha Marry as good as yourself I hope'  'Since you make such a Return to my Civility' said the other I must acquaint you Mrs  Honour  that you are not so good as me In the Country one is indeed obliged  to take up with all kind of Trumpery but in Town I visit none but the Women of Women of Quality Indeed Mrs  Honour  there is some Difference I hope between you and me'  'I hope so too' answered  Honour  'there is some Difference in our Ages andI think in our Persons'  Upon speaking which last Words she strutted by Mrs  Western  's Maid with the most provoking Air of Contempt turning up her Nose tossing her Head and violently brushing the Hoop of her Competitor with her own The other Lady put on one of her most malicious Sneers and said  'Creature you are below my Anger and it is beneath me to give ill Words to such an audacious saucy Trollop but Hussy I must tell you your Breeding shews the Meanness of your Birth as well as of your Education and both very properly qualify you to be the mean serving Woman of a Country Girl'  'Don't abuse my Lady' cries  Honour  'I won't take that of you she's as much better than yours as she is younger and ten thousand Times more handsomer  Here rather ill Luck or rather good Luck sent Mrs  Western  to see her Maid in Tears which began to flow plentifully at her Approach and of which being asked the Reason by her Mistress she presently acquainted her that her Tears were occasioned by the rude Treatment of that Creature there meaning  Honour  'And Madam' continued she 'I could have despised all she said to me but she had the Audacity to affront your Ladyship and to call you uglyYes Madam she called you ugly old Cat to my Face I could not bear to hear your Ladyship called ugly'    Why do you repeat her Impudence so often'  said Mrs  Western  And then turning to Mrs  Honour  she asked her  how she had the Assurance to mention her Name with Disrespect  Disrespect Madam answered  Honour  I never mentioned your Name at all I said somebody was not as handsome as my Mistress and to be sure you know that as well as I  Hussy 'replied the Lady 'I will make such a saucy Trollop as yourself know that I am not a proper Subject of your Discourse And if my Brother doth not discharge you this Moment I will never sleep in his House again I will find him out and have you discharged this Moment'  'Discharged' cries  Honour  'and suppose I am there are more Places in the World than one Thank Heaven good Servants need not want Places and if you turn away all who do not think you handsome you will want Servants very soon let me tell you that  Mrs  Western  spoke or rather thundered in Answer but as she was hardly articulate we cannot be very certain of the Identical Words We shall therefore omit inserting a Speech which at best would not greatly redound to her Honour She then departed in search of her Brother with a Countenance so full of Rage that she resembled one of the Furies rather than a human Creature  The two Chambermaids being again left alone began a second Bout at Altercation which soon produced a Combat of a more active Kind In this the Victory belonged to the Lady of Inferior Rank but not without some Loss of Blood of Hair and of Lawn and Muslin  CHAP IX  The wise Demeanour of Mr  Western  in the Character of a Magistrate A Hint to Justices of Peace concerning the necessary Qualifications of a Clerk with extraordinary Instances of paternal Madness and filial Affection  LOgicians sometimes prove too much by an Argument and Politicians often overreach themselves in a Scheme Thus had it like to have happened to Mrs  Honour  who instead of recovering the rest of her Clothes had like to have stopped even those she had on her Back from escaping For the Squire no sooner heard of her having abused his Sister than he swore twenty Oaths he would send her to  Bridewell  Mrs  Western  was a very goodnatured Woman and ordinarily of a forgiving Temper She had lately remitted the Trespass of a Stagecoach Man who had overturned her Postchaise into a Ditch nay she had even broken the Law in refusing to prosecute a Highwayman who had robbed her not only of a Sum of Money but of her Earrings at the same Time dning her and saying  'such handsome Bs as you don't want Jewels to set them off and be dnd to you  But now so uncertain are our Tempers and so much do we at different Times differ from ourselves she would hear of no Mitigation nor could all the affected Penitence of  Honour  nor all the Entreaties of  Sophia  for her own Servant prevail with her to desist from earnestly desiring her Brother to execute Justiceship for it was indeed a Syllable more than Justice on the Wench  But luckily the Clerk had a Qualification which no Clerk to a Justice of Peace ought ever to be without namely some Understanding in the Law of this  Realm He therefore whispered in the Ear of the Justice that he would exceed his Authority by committing the Girl to  Bridewell  as there had been no Attempt to break the Peace  'for I am afraid Sir' says he 'you cannot legally commit any one to  Bridewell  only for Illbreeding'  In the Matters of high Importance particularly in Cases relating to the Game the Justice was not always attentive to these Admonitions of his Clerk For indeed in executing the Laws under that Head many Justices of Peace suppose they have a large discretionary Power By Virtue of which under the Notion of searching for and taking away Engines for the Destruction of the Game they often commit Trespasses and sometimes Felony at their Pleasure  But this Offence was not of quite so high a Nature nor so dangerous to the Society Here therefore the Justice behaved with some Attention to the Advice of his Clerk For in Fact he had already had two Informations exhibited against him in the King's Bench and had no Curiosity to try a third  The Squire therefore putting on a most wise and significant Countenance after a Preface of several Hum's and Ha's told his Sister that upon more mature Deliberation he was of Opinion that  as there was no breaking up of the Peace such as the Law says he 'calls breaking open a Door or breaking a Hedge or breaking a Head or any such Sort of Breaking the Matter did not amount to a felonious Kind of a Thing nor Trespasses nor Damages and therefore there was no Punishment in the Law for it  Mrs  Western  said  'she knew the Law much better that she had known Servants very severely punished for affronting their Masters and then named a certain Justice of the Peace in  London  who' she said 'would commit a Servant to  Bridewell  at any Time when a Master or Mistress desired it  'Like enough cries the Squire 'it may be so in  London  but the Law is different in the Country'  Here followed a very learned Dispute between the Brother and Sister concerning the Law which we would insert if we imagined many of our Readers could understand it This was however at length referred by both Parties to the Clerk who decided it in Favour of the Magistrate and Mrs  Western  was in the End obliged to content herself with the Satisfaction of having  Honour  turned away to which  Sophia  herself very readily and chearfully consented  Thus Fortune after having diverted herself according to Custom with two or three Frolicks at last disposed all Matters to the Advantage of our Heroine who indeed succeeded admirably well in her Deceit considering it was the first she ever had practised And to say the Truth I have often concluded that the honest Part of Mankind would be much too hard for the knavish if they could bring themselves to incur the Guilt or thought it worth their while to take the Trouble  Honour  acted her Part to the utmost Perfection She no sooner saw herself secure from all Danger of  Bridewell  a Word which had raised most horrible Ideas in her Mind than she resumed those Airs which her Terrours before had a little abated and laid down her Place with as much Affectation of Content and indeed of Contempt as was ever practised at the Resignation of Places of a much greater Importance If the Reader pleases therefore we chuse rather to say she resignedwhich hath indeed been always held a synonymous Expression with being turned out or turned away  Mr  Western  ordered her to be very expeditious in packing For his Sister declared she would not sleep another Night under the same Roof with so impudent  a Slut To work therefore she went and that so earnestly that every Thing was ready early in the Evening when having received her Wages away packed Bag and Baggage to the great Satisfaction of every one but of none more than of  Sophia  who having appointed her Maid to meet her at a certain Place not far from the House exactly at the dreadful and ghostly Hour of Twelve began to prepare for her own Departure  But first she was obliged to give two painful Audiences the one to her Aunt and the other to her Father In these Mrs  Western  herself began to talk to her in a more peremptory Stile than before but her Father treated her in so violent and outragious a Manner that he frightened her into an affected Compliance with his Will which so highly pleased the good Squire that he changed his Frowns into Smiles and his Menaces into promises he vowed his whole Soul was wrapt in hers that her Consent for so he construed the Words  You know Sir I must not nor can refuse to obey any absolute Command of yours  had made him the happiest of Mankind He then gave her a large BankBill to dispose of in any Trinkets she pleased and kissed and embraced her in the fondest Manner while Tears of Joy trickled from those Eyes which a few Moments before had darted Fire and Rage against the dear Object of all his Affection  Instances of this Behaviour in Parents are so common that the Reader I doubt not will be very little astonished at the whole Conduct of Mr  Western  If he should I own I am not able to account for it since that he loved his Daughter most tenderly is I think beyond Dispute So indeed have many others who have rendered their Children most compleatly miserable by the same Conduct which tho' it is almost universal in Parents hath always appeared to me to be the most unaccountable of all the Absurdities  which ever entered into the Brain  of that strange perfidious Creature Man  The latter Part of Mr  Western  's Behaviour had so strong an Effect on the tender Heart of  Sophia  that it suggested a Thought to her which not all the politic Sophistry of her Aunt nor all the Menaces of her Father had ever once brought into her Head She reverenced her Father so piously and loved him so passionately that she had scarce ever felt more pleasing Sensations than what arose from the Share she frequently had of contributing to his Amusement and sometimes perhaps to higher Gratifications for he never could contain the Delight of hearing her commended which he had the Satisfaction of hearing almost every Day of her Life The Idea therefore of the immense Happiness she should convey to her Father by her Consent to this Match made a strong Impression on her Mind Again the extreme Piety of such an Act of Obedience worked very forcibly as she had a very deep Sense of Religion Lastly when she reflected how much she herself was to suffer being indeed to become little less than a Sacrifice or a Martyr to filial Love and Duty she felt an agreeable Tickling in a certain little Passion which tho' it bears no immediate Affinity either to Religion or Virtue is often so kind as to lend great Assistance in executing the Purposes of both  Sophia  was charmed with the Contemplation of so heroic an Action and began to compliment herself with much permature Flattery when  Cupid  who lay hid in her Muff suddenly crept out and like  Punchinello  in a Puppetshew kicked all out before him In Truth for we scorn to deceive our Reader or to vindicate the Character of our Heroine by ascribing her Actions to supernatural Impulse the Thoughts of her beloved  Jones  and some Hopes however distant in which he was very particularly concerned  immediately destroyed all which filial Love Piety and Pride had with their joint Endeavours been labouring to bring about  But before we proceed any farther with  Sophia  we must now look back to Mr  Jones  CHAP X  Containing several Matters natural enough perhaps but  Low  THE Reader will be pleased to remember that we left Mr  Jones  in the Beginning of this Book on his Road to  Bristol  being determined to seek his Fortune at Sea or rather indeed to fly away from his Fortune on Shore  It happened a Thing not very unusual that the Guide who undertook to conduct him on his Way was unluckily unacquainted with the Road so that having missed his right Track and being ashamed to ask Information he rambled about backwards and forwards till Night came on and it began to grow dark  Jones  suspecting what had happened acquainted the Guide with his Apprehensions but he insisted on it that they were in the right Road and added it would be very strange if he should not know the Road to  Bristol  tho' in Reality it would have been much stranger if he had known it having never past through it in his Life before  Jones  had not such implicit Faith in his Guide but that on their arrival at a Village he enquired of the first Fellow he saw whether they were in the Road to  Bristol  'Whence did you come'  cries the Fellow  'no Matter' says  Jones  a little hastily 'I want to know if this be the Road to  Bristol'  'The Road to  Bristol'  cries the Fellow scratching his Head 'Why Master I believe you will hardly get to  Bristol  this Way to Night'  Prithee Friend  then' answered  Jones  'do tell us which is the Way    'Why Measter' cries the Fellow 'you must have come out of your Road the Lord knows whither For thick Way goeth to  Gloucester'  'Well and which Way goes to  Bristol'  said  Jones  Why you be going away from  Bristol  '  answered the Fellow  'Then' said  Jones  'we must go back again'  'Ay you must'  said the Fellow  'Well and when we come back to the Top of the Hill which Way must we take'  'Why you must keep the strait Road'  But I remember there are two Roads one to the Right and the other to the Left'  Why you must keep the righthand Road and then gu strait vorwards only remember to turn first to your Right and then to your Left again and then to your Right and that brings you to the Squire's and then you must keep strait vorwards and turn to the Left'  Another Fellow now came up and asked which Way the Gentlemen were goingof which being informed by  Jones  he first scratched his Head and then leaning upon a Pole he had in his Hand began to tell him  That he must keep the Righthand Road for about a Mile or a Mile and half or zuch a Matter and then he must turn short to the Left which would bring him round by Measter  Jin Bearnes  's' But which is Mr  John Bearnes  's' says  Jones  'O Lord' cries the Fellow 'why don't you know Measter  Jin Bearnes  Whence then did you come  These two Fellows had almost conquered the Patience of  Jones  when a plain welllooking Man who was indeed a Quaker accosted him thus  Friend I perceive thou hast lost thy Way and if thou wilt take my Advice thou wilt not attempt to find it to Night It is almost dark and the Road is difficult to hit besides there have been several Robberies committed lately between this and  Bristol  Here is  a very creditable good House just by where thou may'st find good Entertainment for thyself and thy Cattle till Morning'  Jones  after a little Persuasion agreed to stay in this Place till the Morning and was conducted by his Friend to the PublicHouse  The Landlord who was a very civil Fellow told  Jones  'he hoped he would excuse the Badness of his Accommodation For that his wife was gone from home and had locked up almost every Thing and carried the Keys along with her'  Indeed the Fact was that a favourite Daughter of hers was just married and gone that Morning home with her Husband and that she and her Mother together had almost stript the poor Man of all his Goods as well as Money For tho' he had several Children this Daughter only who was the Mother's Favourite was the Object of her Consideration and to the Humour of this one Child she would with Pleasure have sacrificed all the rest and her Husband into the Bargain  Tho'  Jones  was very unfit for any Kind of Company and would have preferred being alone yet he could not resist the Importunities of the honest Quaker who was the more desirous of sitting with him from having remarked the Melancholy which appeared both in his Countenance and Behaviour and which the poor Quaker thought his Conversation might in some Measure relieve  After they had passed some Time together in such a Manner that my honest Friend might have thought himself at one of his SilentMeetings the Quaker began to be moved by some Spirit or other probably that of Curiosity and said  'Friend I perceive some sad Disaster hath befallen thee but pray be of Comfort Perhaps thou hast lost a Friend If so thou must consider we are all mortal And why should'st thou grieve when thou knowest thy  Grief will do thy Friend no Good We are all born to Affliction I myself have my Sorrows as well as thee and most probably greater Sorrows Tho' I have a clear Estate of a  l  a Year which is as much as I want and I have a Conscience I thank the Lord void of Offence My Constitution is sound and strong and there is no Man can demand a Debt of me nor accuse me of an Injuryyet Friend I should be concerned to think thee as miserable as myself  Here the Quaker ended with a deep Sigh and  Jones  presently answered  'I am very sorry Sir for your Unhappiness whatever is the Occasion of it'  Ah Friend' replyed the Quaker 'one only Daughter is the Occasion One who was my greatest Delight upon Earth and who within this Week is run away from me and is married against my Consent I had provided her a proper Match a sober Man and one of Substance but she forsooth would chuse for herself and away she is gone with a young Fellow not worth a Groat If she had been dead as I suppose thy Friend is I should have been happy'  'That is very strange Sir'  said  Jones  'Why would it not be better for her to be dead than to be a Beggar' replied the Quaker 'For as I told you the Fellow is not worth a Groat and surely she cannot expect that I shall ever give her a Shilling No as she hath married for Love let her live on Love if she can let her carry her Love to Market and see whether any one will change it into Silver or even into Halfpence'  'You know your own Concerns best Sir'  said  Jones  'It must have been' continued the Quaker 'a long premeditated Scheme to cheat me For they have known one another from their infancy and I always preached to her against Loveand told her a thousand Times over it was all Folly and Wickedness Nay the cunning Slut pretended to hearken to me and  to despise all Wantonness of the Flesh and yet at last to break out of a Window up two pair of Stairs For I began indeed a little to suspect her and had locked her up carefully intending the very next Morning to have married her up to my Liking But she disappointed me within a few Hours and escaped away to the Lover of her own chusing who lost no Time For they were married and bedded and all within an Hour  But it shall be the worst Hour's Work for them both that ever they did for they may starve or beg or steal together for me I will never give either of them a Farthing  Here  Jones  starting up cry'd  I really must be excused I wish you would leave me'  'Come come Friend said the Quaker don't give Way to Concern You see there are other People miserable besides yourself'  'I see there are Madmen and Fools and Villains in the World' cries  Jones  'But let me give you a Piece of Advice send for your Daughter and Soninlaw home and don't be yourself the only Cause of Misery to one you pretend to love'  Send for her and her Husband home' cries the Quaker loudly 'I would sooner send for the two greatest Enemies I have in the World'  'Well go home yourself or where you please' said  Jones  'For I will sit no longer in such Company  'Nay Friend' answered the Quaker I scorn to impose my Company on any one'  He then offered to pull Money from his Pocket but  Jones  pushed him with some Violence out of the Room  The Subject of the Quaker's Discourse had so deeply affected  Jones  that he stared very wildly all the Time he was speaking This the Quaker had observed and this added to the rest of his Behaviour inspired honest  Broadbrim  with a Conceit that his Companion was in reality out of his Senses Instead of resenting the Affront therefore the Quaker  was moved with Compassion for his unhappy Circumstances and having communicated his Opinion to the Landlord he desired him to take great Care of his Guest and to treat him with the highest Civility  'Indeed' says the Landlord 'I shall use no such Civility towards him For it seems for all his laced Waistcoat there he is no more a Gentleman than myself but a poor Parish Bastard bred up at a great Squire's about Miles off and now turned out of Doors not for any good to be sure I shall get him out of my House as soon as possible If I do lose my Reckoning the first Loss is always the best It is not above a Year ago that I lost a Silverspoon'  'What dost thou talk of a Parish Bastard  Robin'  answered the Quaker 'Thou must certainly be mistaken in thy Man'  'Not at all' replied  Robin  'the Guide who knows him very well told it me'  For indeed the Guide had no sooner taken his Place at the KitchenFire than he acquainted the whole Company with all he knew or had ever heard concerning  Jones  The Quaker was no sooner assured by this Fellow of the Birth and low Fortune of  Jones  than all Compassion for him vanished and the honest plain Man went home fired with no less Indignation than a Duke would have felt at receiving an Affront from such a Person  The Landlord himself conceived an equal Disdain for his Guest so that when  Jones  rung the Bell in order to retire to Bed he was acquainted that he could have no Bed there Besides Disdain of the mean Condition of his Guest  Robin  entertained violent Suspicion of his Intentions which were he supposed to watch some favourable Opportunity of robbing the House In reality he might have been very well eased of these Apprehensions by the prudent Precautions of his Wife and Daughter who had already removed  every thing which was not fixed to the Freehold but he was by Nature suspicious and had been more particularly so since the Loss of his Spoon In short the Dread of being robbed totally absorbed the comfortable Consideration that he had nothing to lose  Jones  being assured that he could have no Bed very contentedly betook himself to a great Chair made with Rushes when Sleep which had lately shunned his Company in much better Apartments generously paid him a Visit in his humble Cell  As for the Landlord he was prevented by his Fears from retiring to Rest He returned therefore to the Kitchen Fire whence he would survey the only Door which opened into the Parlour or rather Hole where  Jones  was seated and as for the Window to that Room it was impossible for any Creature larger than a Cat to have made his Escape through it  CHAP XI  The Adventure of a Company of Soldiers  THE Landlord having taken his Seat directly opposite to the Door of the Parlour determined to keep Guard there the whole Night The Guide and another Fellow remained long on Duty with him tho' they neither knew his Suspicions nor had any of their own The true Cause of their watching did indeed at length put an End to it for this was no other than the Strength and Goodness of the Beer of which having tippled a very large Quantity they grew at first very noisy and vociferous and afterwards fell both asleep  But it was not in the Power of Liquor to compose the Fears of  Robin  He continued still waking in his Chair with his Eyes fixed stedfastly on the Door which led into the Apartment of Mr  Jones  till a violent Thundering at his outward Gate called him  from his Seat and obliged him to open it which he had no sooner done than his Kitchen was immediately full of Gentlemen in red Coats who all rushed upon him in as tumultuous a Manner as if they intended to take his little Castle by Storm  The Landlord was now forced from his Post to furnish his numerous Guests with Beer which they called for with great Eagerness and upon his second or third Return from the Cellar he saw Mr  Jones  standing before the Fire in the midst of the Soldiers for it may easily be believed that the Arrival of so much good Company should put an End to any Sleep unless that from which we are only to be awakened by the last Trumpet  The Company having now pretty well satisfied their Thirst nothing remained but to pay the Reckoning a Circumstance often productive of much Mischief and Discontent among the inferior Rank of Gentry who are apt to find great Difficulty in assessing the Sum with exact Regard to distributive Justice which directs that every Man shall pay according to the Quantity which he drinks This Difficulty occurred upon the present Occasion and it was the greater as some Gentlemen had in their extreme Hurry marched off after their first Draught and had entirely forgot to contribute any thing towards the the said Reckoning  A violent Dispute now arose in which every Word may be said to have been deposed upon Oath for the Oaths were at least equal to all the other Words spoken In this Controversy the whole Company spoke together and every Man seemed wholly bent to extenuate the Sum which fell to his Share so that the most probable Conclusion which could be foreseen was that a large Portion of the Reckoning would fall to the Landlord's Share to pay or what is much the same thing would remain unpaid  All this while Mr  Jones  was engaged in Conversation with the Serjeant for that Officer was entirely unconcerned in the present Dispute being privileged by immemorial Custom from all Contribution  The Dispute now grew so very warm that it seemed to draw towards a military Decision when  Jones  stepping forward silenced all their Clamours at once by declaring that he would pay the whole Reckoning which indeed amounted to no more than three Shillings and fourpence  This Declaration procured  Jones  the Thanks and Applause of the whole Company The Terms honourable noble and worthy Gentleman resounded through the Room nay my Landlord himself began to have a better Opinion of him and almost to disbelieve the Account which the Guide had given  The Serjeant had informed Mr  Jones  that they were marching against the Rebels and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of  Cumberland  By which the Reader may perceive a Circumstance which we have not thought necessary to communicate before that this was the very Time when the late Rebellion was at the highest and indeed the Banditti were now marched into  England  intending as it was thought to fight the King's Forces and to attempt pushing forward to the Metropolis  Jones  had some Heroic Ingredients in his Composition and was a hearty Wellwisher to the glorious Cause of Liberty and of the Protestant Religion It is no wonder therefore that in Circumstances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild Undertaking it should occur to him to serve as a Volunteer in this Expedition  Our commanding Officer had said all in his Power to encourage and promote this good Disposition from the first Moment he had been acquainted with it He now proclaimed the noble Resolution aloud which was received with great Pleasure by the whole Company  who all cried out  'God bless King  George  and your Honour' and then added with many Oaths 'We will stand by you both to the last Drops of our Blood'  The Gentleman who had been all Night tippling at the Alehouse was prevailed on by some Arguments which a Corporal had put into his Hand to undertake the same Expedition And now the Portmanteau belonging to Mr  Jones  being put up in the Baggagecart the Forces were about to move forwards when the Guide stepping up to  Jones  said  'Sir I hope you will consider that the Horses have been kept out all Night and we have travelled a great ways out of our Way'  Jones  was surprized at the Impudence of this Demand and acquainted the Soldiers with the Merits of his Cause who were all unanimous in condemning the Guide for his Endeavours to put upon a Gentleman Some said he ought to be tied Neck and Heels others that he deserved to run the Gauntlope and the Serjeant shook his Cane at him and wished he had him under his Command swearing heartily he would make an Example of him  Jones  contented himself however with a negative Punishment and walked off with his new Comrades leaving the Guide to the poor Revenge of cursing and reviling him in which latter the Landlord joined saying  'Ay ay he is a pure one I warrant you A pretty Gentleman indeed to go for a Soldier He shall wear a laced Waistcoat truly It is an old Proverb and a true one all is not Gold that glisters I am glad my House is well rid of him'  All that Day the Serjeant and the young Soldier marched together and the former who was an arch Fellow told the latter many entertaining Stories of his Campaigns tho' in Reality he had never made any for he was but lately come into the Service and had by his own Dexterity so well ingratiated himself  with his Officers that he had promoted himself to a Halberd chiefly indeed by his Merit in recruiting in which he was most excellently well skilled  Much Mirth and Festivity passed among the Soldiers during their March In which the many Occurrences that had passed at their last Quarters were remembered and every one with great Freedom made what Jokes he pleased on his Officers some of which were of the coarser Kind and very near bordering on Scandal This brought to our Heroe's Mind the Custom which he had read of among the  Greeks  and  Romans  of indulging on certain Festivals and solemn Occasions the Liberty to Slaves of using an uncontrouled Freedom of Speech towards their Masters  Our little Army which consisted of two Companies of Foot were now arrived at the Place where they were to halt that Evening The Serjeant then acquainted his Lieutenant who was the commanding Officer that they had picked up two Fellows in that Day's March one of which he said was as fine a Man as ever he saw meaning the Tippler for that he was near six Feet wellproportioned and strongly limbed and the other meaning  Jones  would do well enough for their rear Rank  The new Soldiers were now produced before the Officer who having examined the six Foot Man he being first produced came next to survey  Jones  at the first Sight of whom the Lieutenant could not help shewing some Surprize for besides that he was very well dressed and was naturally genteel he had a remarkable Air of Dignity in his Look which is rarely seen among the Vulgar and is indeed not inseparably annexed to the Features of their Superiors  'Sir' said the Lieutenant 'my Serjeant informed me that you are desirous of enlisting in the Company I have at present under my command  if so Sir we shall very gladly receive a Gentleman who promises to do much Honour to the Company by bearing Arms in it'  Jones  answered  'That he had not mentioned any thing of enlisting himself that he was most zealously attached to the glorious Cause for which they were going to fight and was very desirous of serving as a Volunteer'  concluding with some Compliments to the Lieutenant and expressing the great Satisfaction he should have in being under his Command  The Lieutenant returned his Civility commended his Resolution shook him by the Hand and invited him to dine with himself and the rest of the Officers  CHAP XII  The Adventure of a Company of Officers  THE Lieutenant whom we mentioned in the preceding Chapter and who commanded this Party was now near sixty Years of Age He had entered very young into the Army and had served in the Capacity of an Ensign at the Battle of  Tannieres  here he had received two Wounds and had so well distinguished himself that he was by the Duke of  Marlborough  advanced to be a Lieutenant immediately after that Battle  In this Commission he had continued ever since  viz  near forty Years during which Time he had seen vast Numbers preferred over his Head and had now the Mortification to be commanded by Boys whose Fathers were at Nurse when he had first entered into the Service  Nor was this ill Success in his Profession solely owing to his having no Friends among the Men in Power He had the Misfortune to incur the Displeasure of his Colonel who for many Years continued in the Command of this Regiment Nor did he owe  the implacable Illwill which this Man bore him to any Neglect or Deficiency as an Officer nor indeed to any Fault in himself but solely to the Indiscretion of his Wife who was a very beautiful Woman and who tho' she was remarkably fond of her Husband would not purchase his Preferment at the Expence of certain Favours which the Colonel required of her  The poor Lieutenant was more peculiarly unhappy in this that while he felt the Effects of the Enmity of his Colonel he neither knew nor suspected that he really bore him any for he could not suspect an Illwill for which he was not conscious of giving any Cause and his Wife fearing what her Husband's nice Regard to his Honour might have occasioned contented herself with preserving her Virtue without enjoying the Triumphs of her Conquest  This unfortunate Officer for so I think he may be called had many good Qualities besides his Merit in his Profession for he was a religious honest good natured Man and had behaved so well in his Command that he was highly esteemed and beloved not only by the Soldiers of his own Company but by the whole Regiment  The other Officers who marched with him were a  French  Lieutenant who had been long enough out of  France  to forget his own Language but not long enough in  England  to learn ours so that he really spoke no Language at all and could barely make himself understood on the most ordinary Occasions There were likewise two Ensigns both very young Fellows one of whom had been bred under an Attorney and the other was Son to the Wife of a Nobleman's Butler  As soon as Dinner was ended  Jones  informed the Company of the Merriment which had passed among the Soldiers upon their March  'and yet' says he 'notwithstanding all their Vociferation I dare swear they will behave more like  Grecians  than  Trojans  when they come to the Enemy'  'Grecians  and  Trojans'  says one of the Ensigns 'who the Devil are they I have heard of all the Troops in  Europe  but never of any such as these'  'Don't pretend to more Ignorance than you have Mr  Northerton'  said the worthy Lieutenant 'I suppose you have heard of the  Greeks  and  Trojans  tho' perhaps you never read  Pope's Homer  who I remember now the Gentleman mentions it compares the March of the  Trojans  to the Cackling of Geese and greatly commends the Silence of the  Grecians  And upon my Honour there is great Justice in the Cadet's Observation'  'Begar me remember dem ver well' said the  French  Lieutenant 'me ave read dem at School in dans Madam  Daciere  des  Greek  des  Trojan  dey fight for von Womanouy ouy me ave read all dat'  'Dn  Homo  with all my Heart' says  Northerton  'I have the Marks of him in my Ayet There's  Thomas  of our Regiment always carries a  Homo  in his Pocket Dn me if ever I come at it if I don't burn it And there's  Corderius  another dn'd Son of a Whore that hath got me many a Flogging'  'Then you have been at School Mr  Northerton'  said the Lieutenant'  'Ay dn me have I' answered he 'the Devil take my Father for sending me thither The old Put wanted to make a Parson of me but dn me thinks I to myself I'll nick you there old Cull The Devil a Smack of your Nonsense shall you ever get into me There's  Jimmey Oliver  of our Regiment he narrowly escaped being a Pimp too and that would have been a thousand Pities For dn me if he is not one of the prettiest Fellows in the whole World but he went farther than  I with the old Cull For  Jimmey  can neither write nor read'  'You give your Friend a very good Character' said the Lieutenant 'and a very deserved one I dare say but prithee  Northerton  leave off that foolish as well as wicked Custom of swearing For you are deceived I promise you if you think there is Wit or Politeness in it I wish too you would take my Advice and desist from abusing the Clergy Scandalous Names and Reflections cast on any Body of Men must be always unjustifiable but especially so when thrown on so sacred a Function For to abuse the Body is to abuse the Function itself and I leave to you to judge how inconsistent such a Behaviour is in Men who are going to fight in Defence of the Protestant Religion'  Mr  Adderley  which was the Name of the other Ensign had sat hitherto kicking his Heels and humming a Tune without seeming to listen to the Discourse he now answered  '  O Monsieur on ne parle pas de la Religion dans la Guerre'  'Well said  Jack'  cries  Northerton  'if la Religion was the only Matter the Parsons should fight their own Battles for me'  'I don't know Gentlemen' says  Jones  'what may be your Opinion but I think no Man can engage in a nobler Cause than that of his Religion and I have observed in the little I have read of History that no Soldiers have fought so bravely as those who have been inspired with a religious Zeal For my own Part tho' I love my King and Country I hope as well as any Man in it yet the Protestant Interest is no small Motive to my becoming a Volunteer in the Cause'  Northerton  now winked on  Adderley  and whispered to him slily  'Smoke the Prig  Adderley  smoke him'  Then turning to  Jones  said to him  'I am very glad Sir you have chosen our Regiment  to be a Volunteer in For if our Parson should at any Time take a Cup too much I find you can supply his Place I presume Sir you have been at the University may I crave the Favour to know what College'  'Sir' answered  Jones  'so far from having been at the University I have not even had the Advantage of yourself for I was never at School'  'I presumed' cries the Ensign 'only upon the Information of your great Learning'    Oh Sir' answered  Jones  'it is as possible for a Man to know something without having been at School as it is to have been at School and to know nothing'  'Well said young Volunteer' cries the Lieutenant 'upon my Word  Northerton  you had better let him alone for he will be too hard for you'  Northerton  did not very well relish the Sarcasm of  Jones  but he thought the Provocation was scarce sufficient to justify a Blow or a Rascal or Scoundrel which were the only Repartees that suggested themselves He was therefore silent at present but resolved to take the first Opportunity of returning the Jest by Abuse  It now came to the Turn of Mr  Jones  to give a Toast as it is called who could not refrain from mentioning his dear  Sophia  This he did the more readily as he imagined it utterly impossible that any one present should guess the Person he meant  But the Lieutenant who was the Toastmaster was not contented with  Sophia  only He said he must have her Sirname upon which  Jones  hesitated a little and presently after named Miss  Sophia Western  Ensign  Northerton  declared he would not drink her Health in the same Round with his own Toast unless somebody would vouch for her  'I knew one  Sophy Western'  says he that was lainwith by half the young Fellows at  Bath  and perhaps this is the same Woman'  Jones  very solemnly  assured him of the contrary asserting that the young Lady he named was one of great Fashion and Fortune  'Ay ay' says the Ensign 'and so she is dn me it is the same Woman and I'll hold Half a Dozen of  Burgundy Tom French  of our Regiment brings her into Company with us at any Tavern in  Bridgesstreet'  He then proceeded to describe her Person exactly for he had seen her with her Aunt and concluded with saying  'That her Father had a great Estate in  Somersetshire'  The Tenderness of Lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the Names of their Mistresses However  Jones  tho' he had enough of the Lover and of the Heroe too in his Disposition did not resent these Slanders as hastily as perhaps he ought to have done To say the Truth having seen but little of this Kind of Wit he did not readily understand it and for a long Time imagined Mr  Northerton  had really mistaken his Charmer for some other But now turning to the Ensign with a stern Aspect he said  'Pray Sir chuse some other Subject for your Wit For I promise you I will bear no jesting with this Lady's Character'  'Jesting' cries the other 'dn me if ever I was more in Earnest in my Life  Tom French  of our Regiment had both her and her Aunt at  Bath'  'Then I must tell you in Earnest' cries  Jones  'that you are one of the most impudent Rascals upon Earth'  He had no sooner spoken these Words than the Ensign together with a Volly of Curses discharged a Bottle full at the Head of  Jones  which hitting him a little above the right Temple brought him instantly to the Ground  The Conqueror perceiving the Enemy to lie motionless before him and Blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his Wound began now to think of quitting the Field of Battle where no more  Honour was to be gotten but the Lieutenant interposed by stepping before the Door and thus cut off his Retreat  Northerton  was very importunate with the Lieutenant for his Liberty urging the ill Consequences of his Stay asking him what could he have done less  'Zounds' says he 'I was but in Jest with the Fellow I never heard any Harm of Miss  Western  in my Life'  'Have not you' said the Lieutenant 'then you richly deserve to be hanged as well for making such Jests as for using such a Weapon You are my Prisoner Sir nor shall you stir from hence till a proper Guard comes to secure you'  Such an Ascendant had our Lieutenant over this Ensign that all that Fervency of Courage which had levelled our poor Heroe with the Floor would scarce have animated the said Ensign to have drawn his sword against the Lieutenant had he then had one dangling at his Side but all the Swords being hung up in the Room were at the very Beginning of the Fray secured by the  French  Officer So that Mr  Northerton  was obliged to attend the final Issue of this Affair  The  French  Gentleman and Mr  Adderley  at the Desire of their CommandingOfficer had raised up the Body of  Jones  but as they could perceive but little if any sign of Life in him they again let him fall  Adderley  damning him for having blooded his Waistcoat and the  Frenchman  declaring  'Begar me no tush de Engliseman de mort me ave heard de Englise Ley Law what you call hang up de Man dat tush him last'  When the good Lieutenant applied himself to the Door he applied himself likewise to the Bell and the Drawer immediately attending he dispatched him for a File of Musqueteers and a Surgeon These Commands together with the Drawer's Report of what he had himself seen not only produced the Soliders but presently drew up the Landlord of the  House his Wife and Servants and indeed every one else who happened at that Time to be in the Inn  To describe every Particular and to relate the whole Conversation of the ensuing Scene is not within my Power unless I had forty Pens and could at once write with them altogether as the Company now spoke The Reader must therefore content himself with the most remarkable Incidents and perhaps he may very well excuse the rest  The first Thing done was securing the Body of  Northerton  who being delivered into the Custody of six Men with a Corporal at their Head was by them conducted from a Place which he was very willing to leave but it was unluckily to a Place whither he was very unwilling to go To say the Truth so whimsical are the Desires of Ambition the very Moment this Youth had attained the abovementioned Honour he would have been well contented to have retired to some Corner of the World where the Fame of it should never have reached his Ears  It surprizes us and so perhaps it may the Reader that the Lieutenant a worthy and good Man should have applied his chief Care rather to secure the Offender than to preserve the Life of the wounded Person We mention this Observation not with any View of pretending to account for so odd a Behaviour but lest some Critic should hereafter plume himself on discovering it We would have these Gentlemen know we can see what is odd in Characters as well as themselves but it is our Business to relate Facts as they are which when we have done it is the Part of the learned and sagacious Reader to consult that original Book of Nature whence every Passage in our Work is transcribed tho' we quote not always the particular Page for its Authority  The Company which now arrived were of a different Disposition They suspended their Curiosity  concerning the Person of the Ensign till they should see him hereafter in a more engaging Attitude At present their whole Concern and Attention were employed about the bloody Object on the Floor which being placed upright in a Chair soon began to discover some Symptoms of Life and Motion These were no sooner perceived by the Company for  Jones  was at first generally concluded to be dead than they all fell at once to prescribing for him For as none of the physical Order was present every one there took that Office upon him  Bleeding was the Unanimous Voice of the whole Room but unluckily there was no Operator at hand Every one then cry'd 'Call the Barber' but none stirred a Step Several Cordials were likewise prescribed in the same ineffective Manner till the Landlord ordered up a Tankard of his strong Beer with a Toast which he said was the best Cordial in  England  The Person principally assistant on this Occasion indeed the only one who did any Service or seemed likely to do any was the Landlady She cut off some of her Hair and applied it to the Wound to stop the Blood She fell to chafing the Youth's Temples with her Hand and having exprest great Contempt for her Husband's Prescription of Beer she dispatched one of her Maids to her own Closet for a Bottle of Brandy of which as soon as it was brought she prevailed upon  Jones  who was just returned to his Senses to drink a very large and plentiful Draught  Soon afterwards arrived the Surgeon who having viewed the Wound having shaken his Head and blamed every Thing which was done ordered his Patient instantly to Bed in which Place we think proper to leave him some Time to his Repose and shall here therefore put an End to this Chapter  CHAP XIII  Containing the great Address of the Landlady the great Learning of a Surgeon and the solid Skill in Casuistry of the worthy Lieutenant  WHEN the wounded Man was carried to his Bed and the House began again to clear up from the Hurry which this Accident had occasioned the Landlady thus addressed the commanding Officer  'I am afraid Sir' said she 'this young Man did not behave himself as well as he should do to your Honours and if he had been killed I suppose he had had but his  Desarts  to be sure when Gentlemen admit inferior  Parsons  into their Company they  oft  to keep their Distance but as my first Husband used to say few of them knew how to do it For my own Part I am sure I should not have suffered any Fellows to  include  themselves into Gentlemen's Company but I  thoft  he had been an Officer himself till the Serjeant told me he was but a Recruit  'Landlady' answered the Lieutenant 'you mistake the whole Matter The young Man behaved himself extremely well and is I believe a much better Gentleman than the Ensign who abused him If the young Fellow dies the Man who struck him will have most Reason to be sorry for it For the Regiment will get rid of a very troublesome Fellow who is a Scandal to the Army and if he escapes from the Hands of Justice blame me Madam that's all  'Ay Ay good Lackaday' said the Landlady 'who could have  thoft  it Ay ay ay I am satisfied your Honour will see Justice done and to be sure it  oft  to be to every one Gentlemen  oft  not to kill poor Folks without answering for it  A poor Man hath a Soul to be saved as well as his Betters'  'Indeed Madam said the Lieutenant you do the Volunteer wrong I dare swear he is more of a Gentleman than the Officer'  'Ay' cries the Lanlady 'why look you there now Well my first Husband was a wise Man he used to say you can't always know the Inside by the Outside Nay that might have been well enough too For I never  saw'd  him till he was all over Blood Who would have  thoft  it mayhap some young Gentleman crost in Love Good Lackaday if he should die what a Concern it would be to his Parents Why sure the Devil must possess the wicked Wretch to do such an Act To be sure he is a Scandal to the Army as your Honour says For most of the Gentlemen of the Army that ever I saw are quite different Sort of People and look as if they would scorn to spill any Christian Blood as much as any Men I mean that is in a civil Way as my first Husband used to say To be sure when they come into the Wars there must be Bloodshed but they are not to be blamed for that The more of our Enemies they kill there the better and I wish with all my Heart they could kill every Mother's Son' of them  'O fie Madam' said the Lieutenant smiling 'ALL is rather too bloodyminded a Wish'  'Not at all Sir' answered she 'I am not at all bloodyminded only to our Enemies and there is no Harm in that To be sure it is natural for us to wish our Enemies dead that the Wars may be at an End and our Taxes be lowered For it is a dreadful Thing to pay as we do Why now there is above forty Shillings for Windowlights and yet we have stopt up all we could we have  almost blinded the House I am sure Says I to the Exciseman says I I think you  oft  to favour us I am sure we are very good Friends to the Goverment and so we are for  sartain  For we pay a Mint of Money to 'um And yet I often think to myself the Government doth not imagine itself more obliged to us than to those that don't pay 'um a Farthing'  Ay ay it is the Way of the World  She was proceeding in this Manner when the Surgeon entered the Room The Lieutenant immediately asked how his Patient did But he resolved him only by saying  'Better I believe than he would have been by this Time if I had not been called and even as it is perhaps it would have been lucky if I could have been called sooner'  I hope Sir' said the Lieutenant 'the Skull is not fractured' Hum' cries the Surgeon 'Fractures are not always the most dangerous Symptoms Contusions and Lacerations are often attended with worse Phaenomena and with more fatal Consequences than Fractures People who know nothing of the Matter conclude if the Skull is not fractured all is well whereas I had rather see a Man's Skull broke all to Pieces than some Contusions I have met with I hope' says the Lieutenant 'there are no such Symptoms here'  'Symptoms' answered the Surgeon 'are not always regular nor constant I have known very unfavourable Symptoms in the Morning change to favourable ones at Noon and return to unfavourable again at Night Of Wounds indeed it is rightly and truly said  Nem  repente fuit turpissimus  I was once I remember called to a Patient who had received a violent Contusion in his Tibia by which the exterior Cutis was lacerated so that there was a profuse sanguinary Discharge and the interior Membranes were so divellicated that the Os or Bone very plainly appeared through the Aperture of the Vulnus or  Wound Some febrile Symptoms intervening at the same Time for the Pulse was exuberant and indicated much Phlebotomy I apprehended an immediate Mortification To prevent which I presently made a large Orifice in the Vein of the left Arm whence I drew twenty Ounces of Blood which I expected to have found extremely sizy and glutinous or indeed coagulated as it is in pleuritic Complaints but to my Surprize it appeared rosy and florid and its Consistency differed little from the Blood of those in perfect Health I then applied a Fomentation to the Part which highly answered the Intention and after three or four Times dressing the Wound began to discharge a thick Pus or Matter by which Means the Cohesionbut perhaps I do not make myself perfectly well understood'  'No really' answered the Lieutenant 'I cannot say I understand a Syllable'  'Well Sir' said the Surgeon 'then I shall not tire your Patience in short within six Weeks my Patient was able to walk upon his Legs as perfectly as he could have done before he received the Contusion'  'I wish Sir' said the Lieutenant 'you would be so kind only to inform me whether the Wound this young Gentleman hath had the Misfortune to receive is likely to prove mortal'  'Sir' answered the Surgeon 'to say whether a Wound will prove mortal or not at first Dressing would be very weak and foolish Presumption We are all mortal and Symptoms often occur in a Cure which the greatest of our Profession could never foresee'    'But do you think him in Danger'  says the other  'In Danger ay surely' cries the Doctor 'who is there among us who in the most perfect Health can be said not to be in Danger Can a Man therefore with so bad a Wound as this be said to be out of Danger All I can say at present is that it is well I was called as I was and perhaps it would have been  better if I had been called sooner I will see him again early in the Morning and in the mean Time let him be kept extremely quiet and drink liberally of WaterGruel'  'Won't you allow him Sackwhey' said the Landlady  'Ay ay Sackwhey' cries the Doctor 'if you will provided it be very small'  'And a little Chickenbroth too' added she'    'Yes yes Chickenbroth' said the Doctor 'is very good'  'May'nt I make him some Jellies too' said the Landlady'  'Ay ay' answered the Doctor 'Jellies are very good for Wounds for they promote Cohesion'  And indeed it was lucky she had not named Soop or high Sauces for the Doctor would have complied rather than have lost the Custom of the House  The Doctor was no sooner gone than the Landlady began to trumpet forth his Fame to the Lieutenant who had not from their short Acquaintance conceived quite so favourable an Opinion of his physical Abilities as the good Woman and all the Neighbourhood entertained and indeed very rightly for tho' I am afraid the Doctor was a little of a Coxcomb he might be nevertheless very much of a Surgeon  The Lieutenant having collected from the learned Discourse of the Surgeon that Mr  Jones  was in great Danger gave Orders for keeping Mr  Northerton  under a very strict Guard intending in the Morning to attend him to a Justice of Peace and to commit the conducting the Troops to  Glocester  to the  French  Lieutenant who tho' he could neither read write nor speak any language was however a good Officer  In the Evening our Commander sent a Message to Mr  Jones  that if a Visit would not be troublesome he would wait on him This Civility was very kindly and thankfully received by  Jones  and the Lieutenant accordingly went up to his Room  where he found the wounded Man much better than he expected nay  Jones  assured his Friend that if he had not received express Orders to the contrary from the Surgeon he should have got up long ago For he appeared to himself to be as well as ever and felt no other Inconvenience from his Wound but an extreme Soreness on that Side of his Head  'I should be very glad' quoth the Lieutenant 'that you was as well as you fancy yourself For then you would be able to do yourself Justice immediately for when a Matter can't be made up as in Case of a Blow the sooner you take him out the better but I am afraid you think yourself better than you are and he would have too much Advantage over you'  'I'll try however' answered  Jones  'if you please and will be so kind to lend me a Sword For I have none here of my own'  'My Sword is heartily at your Service' my dear Boy cries the Lieutenant kissing him 'you are a brave Lad and I love your Spirit but I fear your Strength For such a Blow and so much Loss of Blood must have very much weakened you and tho' you feel no Want of Strength in your Bed yet you most probably would after a Thrust or two I can't consent to your taking him out Tonight but I hope you will be able to come up with us before we get many Days March advance and I give you my Honour you shall have Satisfaction or the Man who hath injured you shan't stay in our Regiment'  'I wish' said  Jones  'it was possible to decide this Matter Tonight now you have mentioned it to me I shall not be able to rest'  'O never think of it' returned the other 'a few Days will make no Difference The Wounds of  Honour are not like those in your Body They suffer nothing by the Delay of Cure It will be altogether as well for you to receive Satisfaction a Week hence as now'  'But suppose' says  Jones  'I should grow worse and die of the Consequences of my present Wound'  'Then your Honour' answered the Lieutenant 'will require no Reparation at all I myself will do Justice to your Character and will testify to the World your Intention to have acted properly if you had recovered'  'Still' replied  Jones  'I am concerned at the Delay I am almost afraid to mention it to you who are a Soldier but tho' I have been a very wild young Fellow still in my most serious Moments and at the Bottom I am really a Christian'  'So am I too I assure you' said the Officer 'And so zealous a one that I was pleased with you at Dinner for taking up the Cause of your Religion and I am a little offended with you now young Gentleman that you should express a Fear of declaring your Faith before any one'  'But how terrible must it be' cries  Jones  'to any one who is really a Christian to cherish Malice in his Breast in Opposition to the Command of him who hath expresly forbid it How can I bear to do this on a sick Bed Or how shall I make up my Account with such an Article as this in my' Bosom against me  'Why I believe there is such a Command' cries the Lieutenant 'but a Man of Honour can't keep it And you must be a Man of Honour if you will be in the Army I remember I once put the Case to our Chaplain over a Bowl of Punch and he confessed there was much Difficulty in it but said he hoped there might be a Latitude granted to Soldiers in this one Instance and to be sure it is our Duty to hope so For who would bear to  live without his Honour No no my dear Boy be a good Christian as long as you live but be a Man of Honour too and never put up an Affront not all the Books nor all the Parsons in the World shall ever persuade me to that I love my Religion very well but I love my Honour more There must be some Mistake in the wording the Text or in the Translation or in the understanding it or somewhere or other But however that be a Man must run the Risque for he must preserve his Honour So compose yourself Tonight and I promise you you shall have an Opportunity of doing yourself Justice'  Here he gave  Jones  a hearty Buss shook him by the Hand and took his Leave  But tho' the Lieutenant's Reasoning was very satisfactory to himself it was not entirely so to his Friend  Jones  therefore having revolved this Matter much in his Thoughts at last came to a Resolution which the Reader will find in the next Chapter  CHAP XIV  A most dreadful Chapter indeed and which few Readers ought to venture upon in an Evening especially when alone  JONES  swallowed a large Mess of Chicken or rather Cock Broth with a very good Appetite  indeed he would have done the Cock it was made  f with a Pound of Bacon into the Bargain and  ow finding in himself no Deficiency of either Health or Spirit he resolved to get up and seek his  nemy  But first he sent for the Serjeant who was his first  cquaintance among these military Gentlemen Un  ckily that worthy Officer having in a literal Sense  taken his Fill of Liquor had been some Time retired to his Bolster where he was snoaring so loud that it was not easy to convey a Noise in at his Ears capable of drowning that which issued from hi  Nostrils  However as  Jones  persisted in his Desire of seeing him a vociferous Drawer at length found Means to disturb his Slumbers and to acquaint him with the Message Of which the Serjeant was no sooner made sensible than he arose from his Bed and having his Clothes already on immediately attended  Jones  did not think fit to acquaint the Serjeant with his Design tho' he might have done it with great Safety for the Halberdier was himself a Man of Honour and had killed his Man He would therefore have faithfully kept this Secret or indeed any other which no Reward was published for discovering But as  Jones  knew not these Virtues in so short an Acquaintance his Caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough  He began therefore by acquainting the Serjeant that now he was entered into the Army he was ashamed of being without what was perhaps the most necessary Implement of a Soldier namely a Sword adding that he should be infinitely obliged to him if he could procure one  'For which' says he 'I will give you any reasonable Price Nor do I insist upon its being Silverhilted only a good Blade and such as may become a Soldier's Thigh'  The Serjeant who well knew what had happened and had heard that  Jones  was in a very dangerous Condition immediately concluded from such a Message at such a Time of Night and from a Man in such a Situation that he was lightheaded Now as he had his Wit to use that Word in its common Signification always ready he bethought himself of making his Advantage of this Humour in the sick Man  'Sir' says he 'I believe I can fit you I  have a most excellent Piece of Stuff by me It is not indeed Silverhilted which as you say doth not become a Soldier but the Handle is decent enough and the Blade one of the best in  Europe  It is a Blade thata Blade thatIn short I will fetch it you this Instant and you shall see it and handle itI am glad to see your Honour so well with all my Heart'  Being instantly returned with the Sword he delivered it to  Jones  who took it and drew it and then told the Serjeant it would do very well and bid him name his Price  The Serjeant now began to harangue in Praise of his Goods He said nay he swore very heartily  'that the Blade was taken from a  French  Officer of very high Rank at the Battle of  Dettingen  I took it myself' says he 'from his Side after I had knocked him o' the Head The Hilt was a golden one That I sold to one of our fine Gentlemen for there are some of them an't please your Honour who value the Hilt of a Sword more than the Blade'  Here the other stopped him and begged him to name a Price The Serjeant who thought  Jones  absolutely out of his Senses and very near his End was afraid lest he should injure his Family by asking too littleHowever after a Moment's Hesitation he contented himself with naming twenty Guineas and swore he would not sell it for less to his own Brother  Twenty Guineas' says  Jones  in the utmost Surprize 'sure you think I am mad or that I never saw a Sword in my Life Twenty Guineas indeed I did not imagine you would endeavour to impose upon meHere take the SwordNo now I think on't I will keep it myself and shew it your Officer in the Morning acquainting him at the same Time what a Price you asked me for it'  The Serjeant as we have said had always his Wit  in sensu praedicto  about him and now plainly saw that  Jones  was not in the Condition he had apprehended him to be he now therefore counterfeited as great Surprize as the other had shewn and said  'I am certain Sir I have not asked you so much out of the way Besides you are to consider it is the only Sword I have and I must run the Risque of my Officer's Displeasure by going without one myself And truly putting all this together I don't think twenty Shillings was so much out of the Way'  'Twenty Shillings' cries  Jones  'why you just now asked me twenty Guineas'  'How cries the Serjeant'Sure your Honour must have mistaken me or else I mistook myselfand indeed I am but half awakeTwenty Guineas indeed no wonder your Honour flew into such a Passion I say twenty Guineas tooNo no I meant twenty Shillings I assure you And when your Honour comes to consider every thing I hope you will not think that so extravagant a Price It is indeed true you may buy a Weapon which looks as well for' less Money But  Here  Jones  interrupted him saying  'I will be so far from making any Words with you that I will give you a Shilling more than your Demand'  He then gave him a Guinea bid him return to his Bed and wished him a good March adding he hoped to overtake them before the Division reached  Worcester  The Serjeant very civilly took his Leave fully satisfied with his Merchandize and not a little pleased with his dextrous Recovery from that false Step into which his Opinion of the Sick Man's Lightheadedness had betrayed him  As soon as the Serjeant was departed  Jones  rose from his Bed and dressed himself entirely putting on even his Coat which as its colour was white  shewed very visibly the Streams of Blood which had flowed down it and now having grasped his newpurchased Sword in his Hand he was going to issue forth when the Thought of what he was about to undertake laid suddenly hold of him and he began to reflect that in a few Minutes he might possibly deprive a human Being of Life or might lose his own  'Very well' said he 'and in what Cause do I venture my Life Why in that of my Honour And who is this human Being A Rascal who hath injured and insulted me without Provocation But is not Revenge forbidden by HeavenYes but it is enjoined by the World Well but shall I obey the World in Opposition to the express Commands of Heaven Shall I incur the divine Displeasure rather than be calledHaCowardScoundrelI'll think no more I am resolved and must fight him'  The Clock had now struck Twelve and every one in the House were in their Beds except the Centinel who stood to guard  Northerton  when  Jones  softly opening his Door issued forth in Pursuit of his Enemy of whose Place of Confinement he had received a perfect Description from the Drawer It is not easy to conceive a much more tremendous Figure than he now exhibited He had on as we have said a lightcoloured Coat covered with Streams of Blood His Face which missed that very Blood as well as twenty Ounces more drawn from him by the Surgeon was pallid Round his Head was a Quantity of Bandage not unlike a Turban In the right Hand he carried a Sword and in the left a Candle So that the bloody  Banquo  was not worthy to be compared to him In Fact I believe a more dreadful Apparition was never raised in a Churchyard nor in the Imagination of any good People met in a Winter Evening over a Christmas Fire in  Somersetshire  When the Centinel first saw our Heroe approach his Hair began gently to lift up his Grenadier's Cap and in the same Instant his Knees fell to Blows with each other Presently his whole Body was seized with worse than an Ague Fit He then fired his Piece and fell flat on his Face  Whether Fear or Courage was the Occasion of his Firing or whether he took Aim at the Object of his Terror I cannot say If he did however he had the good Fortune to miss his Man  Jones  seeing the Fellow fall guessed the Cause of his Fright at which he could not forbear smiling not in the least reflecting on the Danger from which he had just escaped He then passed by the Fellow who still continued in the Posture in which he fell and entered the Room where  Northerton  as he had heard was confined Here in a solitary Situation he foundan empty Quart Pot standing on the Table on which some Beer being split looked as if the Room had lately been inhabited but at present it was entirely vacant  Jones  then apprehended it might lead to some other Apartment but upon searching all round it he could perceive no other Door than that at which he entered and where the Centinel had been posted He then proceeded to call  Northerton  several Times by his Name but no one answered nor did this serve to any other Purpose than to confirm the Centinel in his Terrors who was now convinced that the Volunteer was dead of his Wounds and that his Ghost was come in Search of the Murtherer He now lay in all the Agonies of Horror and I wish with all my Heart some of those Actors who are hereafter to represent a Man frighted out of his Wits had seen him that they might be taught to copy Nature instead of performing several antic Tricks and Gestures for the Entertainment and Applause of the Galleries  Perceiving the Bird was flown at least despairing to find him and rightly apprehending that the Report of the Firelock would alarm the whole House our Heroe now blew out his Candle and gently stole back again to his Chamber and to his Bed Whither he would not have been able to have gotten undiscovered had any other Person been on the same Staircase save only one Gentleman who was confined to his Bed by the Gout for before he could reach the Door to his Chamber the Hall where the Centinel had been posted was half full of People Some in their Shirts and others not half drest all very earnestly enquiring of each other what was the Matter  The Soldier was now found lying in the same Place and Posture in which we just before left him Several immediately applied themselves to raise him and some concluded him dead But they presently saw their Mistake for he not only struggled with those who laid their Hands on him but fell a roaring like a Bull In reality he imagined so many Spirits or Devils were handling him for his Imagination being possessed with the Horror of an Apparition converted every Object he saw or felt into nothing but Ghosts and Spectres  At length he was overpowered by Numbers and got upon his Legs when Candles being brought and seeing two or three of his Comrades present he came a little to himself but when they asked him what was the Matter he answered  'I am a dead Man that's all I'm a dead Man I can't recover it I have seen him'  What hast thou seen  Jack'  says one of the Soldiers  'Why I have seen the young Volunteer that was killed Yesterday'  He then imprecated the most heavy Curses on himself if he had not seen the Volunteer all over Blood vomiting Fire out of his Mouth and Nostrils pass by him into the Chamber where Ensign  Northerton  was  and then seizing the Ensign by the Throat fly away with him in a Clap of Thunder  This Relation met with a gracious Reception from the Audience All the Women present believed it firmly and prayed Heaven to defend them from Murther Amongst the Men too many had Faith in the Story but others turned it into Derision and Ridicule and a Serjeant who was present answered very coolly  'Young Man you will hear more of this for going to sleep and dreaming on your Post'  The Soldier replied  'You may punish me if you please but I was as broad awake as I am now and the Devil carry me away as he hath the Ensign if I did not see the dead Man as I tell you with Eyes as big and as fiery as two large Flambeaux'  The Commander of the Forces and the Commander of the House were now both arrived For the former being awake at the Time and hearing the Centinel fire his Piece thought it his Duty to rise immediately though he had no great Apprehensions of any Mischief whereas the Apprehensions of the latter were much greater lest her Spoons and Tankards should be upon the March without having received any such Orders from her  Our poor Centinel to whom the Sight of this Officer was not much more welcome than the Apparition as he thought it which he had seen before again related the dreadful Story and with many Additions of Blood and Fire But he had the Misfortune to gain no Credit with either of the last mentioned Persons for the Officer tho' a very religious Man was free from all Terrors of this Kind besides having so lately left  Jones  in the Condition we have seen he had no Suspicion of his being dead As for the Landlady tho' not over religious she had no kind of Aversion to the Doctrine of Spirits but  there was a Circumstance in the Tale which she well knew to be false as we shall inform the Reader presently  But whether  Northerton  was carried away in Thunder or Fire or in whatever other Manner he was gone it was now certain that his Body was no longer in Custody Upon this Occasion the Lieutenant formed a Conclusion not very different from what the Serjeant is just mentioned to have made before and immediately ordered the Centinel to be taken Prisoner So that by a strange Reverse of Fortune tho' not very uncommon in a military Life the Guard became the Guarded  CHAP XV  The Conclusion of the foregoing Adventure  BESIDES the Suspicion of Sleep the Lieutenant harboured another and worse Doubt against the poor Centinel and this was that of Treachery For as he believed not one Syllable of the Apparition so he imagined the whole to be an Invention formed only to impose upon him and that the Fellow had in Reality been bribed by  Northerton  to let him escape And this he imagined the rather as the Fright appeared to him the more unnatural in one who had the Character of as brave and bold a Man as any in the Regiment having been in several Actions having received several Wounds and in a Word having behaved himself always like a good and valiant Soldier  That the Reader therefore may not conceive the least ill Opinion of such a Person we shall not delay a Moment in rescuing his Character from the Imputation of this Guilt  Mr  Northerton  then as we have before observed was fully satisfied with the Glory which he had obtained  from this Action He had perhaps seen or heard or guessed that Envy is apt to attend Fame Not that I would here insinuate that he was heathenishly inclined to believe in or to worship the Goddess  Nemesis  for in fact I am convinced he never heard of her Name He was besides of an Active Disposition and had a great Antipathy to those close Winter Quarters in the Castle of  Gloucester  for which a Justice of Peace might possibly give him a Billet Nor was he moreover free from some uneasy Meditations on a certain wooden Edifice which I forbear to name in Conformity to the Opinion of Mankind who I think rather ought to honour than to be ashamed of this Building as it is or at least might be made of more Benefit to Society than almost any other public Erection In a Word to hint at no more Reasons for his Conduct Mr  Northerton  was desirous of departing that Evening and nothing remained for him but to contrive the  Quomodo  which appeared to be a Matter of some Difficulty  Now this young Gentleman tho' somewhat crooked in his Morals was perfectly strait in his Person which was extremely strong and well made His Face too was accounted handsome by the Generality of Women for it was broad and ruddy with tolerably good Teeth Such Charms did not fail making an Impression on my Landlady who had no little Relish for this kind of Beauty She had indeed a real Compassion for the young Man and hearing from the Surgeon that Affairs were like to go ill with the Volunteer she suspected they might hereafter wear no benign Aspect with the Ensign Having obtained therefore leave to make him a Visit and finding him in a very melancholy Mood which she considerably heightened by telling him there were scarce any Hopes of the Volunteer's Life she proceeded to throw forth some Hints which the other  readily and eagerly taking up they soon came to a right Understanding and it was at length agreed that the Ensign should at a certain Signal ascend the Chimney which communicating very soon with that of the Kitchen he might there again let himself down for which she would give him an Opportunity by keeping the Coast clear  But lest our Readers of a different Complexion should take this Occasion of too hastily condemning all Compassion as a Folly and pernicious to Society we think proper to mention another Particular which might possibly have some little Share in this Action The Ensign happened to be at this Time possessed of the Sum of fifty Pounds which did indeed belong to the whole Company For the Captain having quarrelled with his Lieutenant had entrusted the Payment of his Company to the Ensign This Money however he thought proper to deposite in my Landlady's Hand possibly by way of Bail or Security that he would hereafter appear and answer to the Charge against him but whatever were the Conditions certain it is that she had the Money and the Ensign his Liberty  The Reader may perhaps expect from the compassionate Temper of this good Woman that when she saw the poor Centinel taken Prisoner for a Fact of which she knew him innocent that she should immediately have interposed in his Behalf but whether it was that she had already exhausted all her Compassion in the abovementioned Instance or that the Features of this Fellow tho' not very different from those of the Ensign could not raise it I will not determine but so far from being an Advocate for the present Prisoner she urged his Guilt to his Officer declaring with uplifted Eyes and Hands that she would not have had any Concern in the Escape of a Murderer for all the World  Every thing was now once more quiet and most of the Company returned again to their Beds but the Landlady either from the natural Activity of her Disposition or from her Fear for her Plate having no Propensity to sleep prevailed with the Officers as they were to march within little more than an Hour to spend that Time with her over a Bowl of Punch  Jones  had lain awake all this while and had heard great Part of the Hurry and Bustle that had passed of which he had now some Curiosity to know the Particulars He therefore applied to his Bell which he rung at least twenty Times without any Effect for my Landlady was in such high Mirth with her Company that no Clapper could be heard there but her own and the Drawer and Chambermaid who were sitting together in the Kitchen for neither durst he sit up nor she lie in Bed alone the more they heard the Bell ring the more they were frightened and as it were nailed down in their Places  At last at a lucky Interval of Chat the Sound reached the Ears of our good Landlady who presently sent forth her Summons which both her Servants instantly obeyed  'Joo'  says the Mistress 'don't you hear the Gentleman's Bell ring why don't you go up'  'It is not my Business' answered the Drawer 'to wait upon the Chambers It is  Betty  Chambermaid's'  'If you come to that' answered the Maid 'it is not my Business to wait upon Gentlemen I have done it indeed some times but the Devil fetch me if ever I do again since you make your Preambles about it'  The Bell still ringing violently their Mistress fell into a Passion and swore if the Drawer did not go up immediately she would turn him away that very Morning  'If you do Madam' says he 'I can't help  it I won't do another Servant's Business'  She then applied herself to the Maid and endeavoured to prevail by gentle Means but all in vain  Betty  was as inflexible as  Joo  Both insisted it was not their Business and they would not do it  The Lieutenant then fell a laughing and said 'Come I will put an End to this Contention' and then turning to the Servants commended them for their Resolution in neither giving up the Point but added he was sure if one would consent to go the other would To which Proposal they both agreed in an Instant and accordingly went up very lovingly and close together When they were gone the Lieutenant appeased the Wrath of the Landlady by satisfying her why they were both so unwilling to go alone  They returned soon after and acquainted their Mistress that the sick Gentleman was so far from being dead that he spoke as heartily as if he was well and that he gave his Service to the Captain and should be very glad of the Favour of seeing him before he marched  The good Lieutenant immediately complied with his Desires and sitting down by his Bedside acquainted him with the Scene which had happened below concluding with his Intentions to make an Example of the Centinel  Upon this  Jones  related to him the whole Truth and earnestly begged him not to punish the poor Soldier  'who I am confident' says he 'is as innocent of the Ensign's Escape as he is of forging any Lie or of endeavouring to impose on you'  The Lieutenant hesitated a few Moments and then answered  'Why as you have cleared the Fellow of one Part of the Charge so it will be impossible to prove the other because he was not the only Centinel But I have a good mind to punish the Rascal  for being a Coward Yet who knows what Effect the Terror of such an Apprehension may have and to say the Truth he hath always behaved well against an Enemy Come it is a good Thing to see any Sign of Religion in these Fellows so I promise you he shall be set at liberty when we march But hark the General beats My dear Boy give me another Buss Don't discompose nor hurry yourself but remember the Christian Doctrine of Patience and I warrant you will soon be able to do yourself Justice and take to an honourable Revenge on the Fellow who hath injured you'  The Lieutenant then departed and  Jones  endeavoured to compose himself to Rest  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK VIII  Containing above two Days  CHAP I  A wonderful long Chapter concerning the Marvellous being much the longest of all our introductory Chapters  AS we are now entering upon a Book in which the Course of our History will oblige us to relate some Matters of a more strange and surprizing Kind than any which have hitherto occurred it may not be amiss in the prolegomenous or introductory Chapter to say something of that Species of Writing which is called the Marvellous To this we shall as well for the Sake of ourselves as of others endeavour to set some certain Bounds and indeed nothing can be more necessary as Criticks  By this Word here and in most other Parts of our Work we mean every Reader in the World  of different Complexions are here apt to run into very different Extremes for while some are with M  Dacier  ready to allow that the same Thing which is impossible may be yet probable  It is happy for M  Dacier  that he was not an  Irishman  others have so little Historic or Poetic Faith that they believe nothing to be either possible or probable the like to which hath not occured to their own Observation  First then I think it may very reasonably be required of every Writer that he keeps within the Bounds of Possibility and still remembers that what it is not possible for Man to perform it is scarce possible for Man to believe he did perform This Conviction perhaps gave Birth to many Stories of the antient Heathen Deities for most of them are of poetical Original The Poet being desirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant Imagination took Refuge in that Power of the Extent of which his Readers were no Judges or rather which they imagined to be infinite and consequently they could not be shocked at any Prodigies related of it This hath been strongly urged in Defence of  Homer  's Miracles and it is perhaps a Defence not as Mr  Pope  would have it because  Ulysses  told a set of foolish Lies to the  Phaeacians  who were a very dull Nation but because the Poet himself wrote to Heathens to whom poetical Fables were Articles of Faith For my own Part I must confess so compassionate is my Temper I wish  Polypheme  had confined himself to his Milk Diet and preserved his Eye nor could  Ulysses  be much more concerned than myself when his Companions were turned into Swine by  Circe  who shewed I think afterwards too much Regard for Man's Flesh to be supposed capable of converting it into Bacon I wish likewise with all my Heart that  Homer  could have known the Rule prescribed by  Horace  to introduce supernatural Agents as seldom as possible We should not then have seen his Gods coming on trivial Errands and often behaving themselves so as not only to forfeit all Title to Respect but to become the Objects of Scorn and Derision A Conduct which must have shocked the Credulity of a pious and sagacious Heathen and which could never have been defended unless by agreeing with a Supposition to which I have been sometimes almost inclined that this most glorious Poet as he certainly was had an Intent to burlesque the superstious Faith of his own Age and Country  But I have rested too long on a Doctrine which can be of no Use to a Christian Writer For as he cannot introduce into his Works any of that heavenly Host which make a Part of his Creed so is it horrid Puerility to search the Heathen Theology for any of those Deities who have been long since dethroned from their Immortality Lord  Shaftsbury  observes that nothing is more cold than the Invocation of a Muse by a Modern he might have added that nothing can be more absurd A modern may with much more Elegance invoke a Ballad as some have thought  Homer  did or a Mug of Ale with the Author of  Hudibras  which latter may perhaps have inspired much more Poetry as well as Prose than all the Liquors of  Hippocrene  or  Helicon  The only supernatural Agents which can in any Manner be allowed to us Moderns are Ghosts but of these I would advise an Author to be extremely sparing These are indeed like Arsenic and other dangerous Drugs in Physic to be used with the utmost Caution nor would I advise the Introduction of them at all in those Works or by those Authors to which or to whom a HorseLaugh in the Reader would be any great Prejudice or Mortification  As for Elves and Fairies and other such Mummery I purposely omit the Mention of them as I  should be very unwilling to confine within any Bounds those surprizing Imaginations for whose Capacity the Limits of human Nature are too narrow whose Works are to be considered as a new Creation and who have consequently just Right to do what they will with their own  Man therefore is the highest Subject unless on very extraordinary Occasions indeed which presents itself to the Pen of our Historian or of our Poet and in relating his Actions great Care is to be taken that we do not exceed the Capacity of the Agent we describe  Nor is Possibility alone sufficient to justify us we must keep likewise within the Rules of Probability It is I think the Opinion of  Aristotle  or if not it is the Opinion of some wise Man whose Authority will be as weighty when it is as old 'that it is no Excuse for a Poet who relates what is incredible that the thing related is really Matter of Fact' This may perhaps be allowed true with regard to Poetry but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the Historian For he is obliged to record Matters as he finds them though they may be of so extraordinary a Nature as will require no small Degree of historical Faith to swallow them Such was the successless Armament of  Xerxes  described by  Herodotus  or the successful Expedition of  Alexander  related by  Arrian  Such of later Years was the Victory of  Agincourt  obtained by  Harry  the Fifth or that of  Narva  won by  Charles  the Twelfth of  Sweden  All which Instances the more we reflect on them appear still the more astonishing  Such Facts however as they occur in the Thread of the Story nay indeed as they constitute the essential Parts of it the Historian is not only justifiable in recording as they really happened but indeed would be unpardonable should he omit or alter them  But there are other Facts not of such Consequence nor so necessary which tho' ever so well attested may nevertheless be sacrificed to Oblivion in Complaisance to the Scepticism of a Reader Such is that memorable Story of the Ghost of  George Villers  which might with more Propriety have been made a Present of to Dr  Drelincourt  to have kept the Ghost of Mrs  Veale  Company at the Head of his Discourse upon Death than have been introduced into so solemn a Work as the History of the Rebellion  To say the Truth if the Historian will confine himself to what really happened and utterly reject any Circumstance which tho' never so well attested he must be well assured is false he will sometimes fall into the Marvellous but never into the Incredible He will often raise the Wonder and Surprize of his Reader but never that incredulous Hatred mentioned by  Horace  It is by falling into Fiction therefore that we generally offend against this Rule of deserting Probability which the Historian seldom if ever quits till he forsakes his Character and commences a Writer of Romance In this however those Historians who relate public Transactions have the Advantage of us who confine ourselves to Scenes of private Life The Credit of the former is by common Notoriety supported for a long Time and public Records with the concurrent Testimony of many Authors bear Evidence to their Truth in future Ages Thus a  Trajan  and an  Antoninus  a  Nero  and a  Caligula  have all met with the Belief of Posterity and no one doubts but that Men so very good and so very bad were once the Masters of Mankind  But we who deal in private Characters who search into the most retired Recesses and draw forth Examples of Virtue and Vice from Holes and Corners of the World are in a more dangerous Situation As'  we have no publick Notoriety no concurrent Testimony no Records to support and corroborate what we deliver it becomes us not only to keep within the Limits of Possibility but of Probability too and this more especially in painting what is greatly good and amiable Knavery and Folly though never so exorbitant will more easily meet with Assent for Illnature adds great Support and Strength to Faith  Thus we may perhaps with little Danger relate the History of a  Fisher  who having long owed his Bread to the Generosity of Mr  Derby  and having that very Morning received a considerable Bounty from his Hands in order to possess himself of what remained in his Friend's Scrutore concealed himself in a public Office of the Temple through which there was a Passage into Mr  Derby  's Chambers Here he overheard Mr  Derby  for many Hours solacing himself at an Entertainment which he that Evening gave his Friends and to which  Fisher  had been invited During all this Time no tender no grateful Reflections arose to restrain his Purpose but when the poor Gentleman had let his Company out through the Office  Fisher  came suddenly from his lurking Place and walking softly behind his Friend into his Chamber discharged a Pistol Ball into his Head This may be believed when the Bones of  Fisher  are as rotten as his Heart Nay perhaps it will be credited that the Villain went two Days afterwards with some young Ladies to the Play of  Hamlet  and with an unaltered Countenance heard one of the Ladies who little suspected how near she was to the Person cry out Good God if the Man that murdered Mr  Derby  was now present Manifesting in this a more seared and callous Conscience than even  Nero  himself of whom we are told by  Suetonius  'that the Consciousness of his Guilt after the Death of his Mother became immediately intolerable and so continued  nor could all the Congratulations of the Soldiers of the Senate and the People allay the Horrors of his Conscience'  But now on the other hand should I tell my Reader that I had known a Man whose penetrating Genius had enabled him to raise a large Fortune in a Way where no Beginning was chaulked out to him That he had done this with the most perfect Preservation of his Integrity and not only without the least Injustice or Injury to any one individual Person but with the highest Advantage to Trade and a vast Increase of the public Revenue That he had expended one Part of the Income of this Fortune in discovering a Taste superior to most by Works where the highest Dignity was united with the purest Simplicity and another Part in displaying a Degree of Goodness superior to all Men by acts of Charity to Objects whose only Recommendations were their Merits or their Wants That he was most industrious in searching after Merit in Distress most eager to relieve it and then as careful perhaps too careful to conceal what he had done That his House his Furniture his Gardens his Table his private Hospitality and his public Beneficence all denoted the Mind from which they flowed and were all intrinsically rich and noble without Tinsel or external Ostentation That he filled every Relation in Life with the most adequate Virtue That he was most piously religious to his Creator most zealously loyal to his Sovereign a most tender Husband to his Wife a kind Relation a munificent Patron a warm and firm Friend a knowing and a chearful Companion indulgent to his Servants hospitable to his Neighbours charitable to the Poor and benevolent to all Mankind Should I add to these the Epithits of wise brave elegant and indeed every other amiable Epithet in our Language I might surely say  Quis credet nemo Hercule nemo  Vel duo vel nemo  And yet I know a Man who is all I have here described But a single Instance and I really know not such another is not sufficient to justify us while we are writing to thousands who never heard of the Person nor of any thing like him Such  Rarae Aves  should be remitted to the EpitaphWriter or to some Poet who may condescend to hitch him in a Distich or to slide him into a Rhime with an Air of Carelesness and Neglect without giving any Offence to the Reader  In the last Place the Actions should be such as may not only be within the Compass of human Agency and which human Agents may probably be supposed to do but they should be likely for the very Actors and Characters themselves to have performed For what may be only wonderful and surprizing in one Man may become improbable or indeed impossible when related of another  This last Requisite is what the dramatic Critics call Conservation of Character and it requires a very extraordinary Degree of Judgment and a most exact Knowledge of human Nature  It is admirably remarked by a most excellent Writer That Zeal can no more hurry a Man to act in direct Opposition to itself than a rapid Stream can carry a Boat against its own Current I will venture to say that for a Man to act in direct Contradiction to the Dictates of Nature is if not impossible as improbable and as miraculous as any Thing which can well be conceived Should the best Parts of the Story of  M Antoninus  be ascribed to  Nero  or should the worst Incidents of  Nero  's Life be imputed to  Antoninus  what would be more shocking to Belief than either Instance whereas both these being related of their proper Agent constitute the Truly Marvellous  Our modern Authors of Comedy have fallen almost universally into the Error here hinted at Their Heroes generally are notorious Rogues and their Heroines abandoned Jades during the first four Acts but in the fifth the former become very worthy Gentlemen and the latter Women of Virtue and Discretion Nor is the Writer often so kind as to give himself the least Trouble to reconcile or account for this monstrous Change and Incongruity There is indeed no other Reason to be assigned for it than because the Play is drawing to a Conclusion as if it was no less natural in a Rogue to repent in the last Act of a Play than in the last of his Life which we perceive to be generally the Case at  Tyburn  a Place which might indeed close the Scene of some Comedies with much Propriety as the Heroes in these are most commonly eminent for those very Talents which not only bring Men to the Gallows but enable them to make an heroic Figure when they are there  Within these few Restrictions I think every Writer may be permitted to deal as much in the Wonderful as he pleases nay the more he can surprise the Reader if he thus keeps within the Rules of Credibility the more he will engage his Attention and the more he will charm him As a Genius of the highest Rank observes in his th Chapter of the  Bathos  'The great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth with Fiction in order to join the Credible with the Surprizing'  For though every good Author will confine himself within the Bounds of Probability it is by no means necessary that his Characters or his Incidents should be trite common or vulgar such as happen in every Street or in every House or which may be met with in the home Articles of a Newspaper Nor must he be inhibited from shewing many Persons and Things which may possibly have never fallen within the Knowledge of great Part of his Readers  If the Writer strictly observes the Rules abovementioned he hath discharged his Part and is then intitled to some Faith from his Reader who is indeed guilty of critical Infidelity if he disbelieves him For want of a Portion of such Faith I remember the Character of a young Lady of Quality which was condemned on the Stage for being unnatural by the unanimous Voice of a very large Assembly of Clerks and Apprentices tho' it had had the previous Suffrages of many Ladies of the first Rank one of whom very eminent for her Understanding declared it was the Picture of half the young People of her Acquaintance  CHAP II  In which the Landlady pays a Visit to Mr  Jones  WHEN  Jones  had taken Leave of his Friend the Lieutenant he endeavoured to close his Eyes but all in vain his Spirits were too lively and wakeful to be lulled to Sleep So having amused or rather tormented himself with the Thoughts of his  Sophia  till it was open Daylight he called for some Tea upon which Occasion my Landlady herself vouchsafed to pay him a Visit  This was indeed the first Time she had seen him or at least had taken any Notice of him but as the Lieutenant had assured her that he was certainly some young Gentleman of Fashion she now determined to shew him all the Respect in her Power for to speak truly this was one of those Houses where Gentlemen to use the Language of Advertisements meet with civil Treatment for their Money  She had no sooner begun to make his Tea than she likewise began to discourse  'La Sir' said she I think it is great Pity that such a pretty young Gentleman should undervalue himself so as to go about with these Soldier Fellows They call themselves Gentlemen I warrant you but as my first Husband  used to say they should remember it is we that pay them And to be sure it is very hard upon us to be obliged to pay them and to keep 'em too as we Publicans are I had twenty of 'um last Night besides Officers nay for matter o' that I had rather have the Soldiers than the Officers For nothing is ever good enough for those Sparks and I am sure if you was to see the Bills La Sir it is nothing I have had less Trouble I warrant you with a good Squire's Family where we take forty or fifty Shillings of a Night besides Horses' And yet I warrants me there is  narrow  a one of all those Officer Fellows but looks upon himself to be as good as  arrow  a Squire of  l  a Year To be sure it doth me Good to hear their Men run about after 'um crying your Honour and your Honour Marry come up with such Honour and an Ordinary at a Shilling a Head Then there's such Swearing among 'um to be sure it frightens me out o' my Wits I think nothing can prosper with such wicked People And here one of 'um has used you in so barbarous a Manner I thought indeed how well the rest would secure him they all hang together for if you had been in Danger of Death which I am glad to see you are not it would have been all as one to such wicked People They would have let the Murderer go Laud have Mercy upon 'um I would not have such a Sin to answer for for the whole World But tho' you are likely with the Blessing to recover there is Laa for him yet and if you will employ Layer  Small  I darest be sworn he'll make the Fellow fly the Country for him tho' perhaps he'll have fled the Country before for it is here Today and gone Tomorrow with such Chaps I hope however you will learn more Wit for the future and return back to your Friends I warrant they are all miserable for your Loss and if they was but to know  what had happened La my seeming I would not for the World they should Come come we know very well what all the Matter is but if one won't another will so pretty a Gentleman need never want a Lady I am sure if I was as you I would see the finest she that ever wore a Head hanged before I would go for a Soldier for herNay don't blush so for indeed he did to a violent Degree why you thought Sir I knew nothing of the Matter I warrant you about Madam  Sophia'  'How' says  Jones  starting up 'do you know my  Sophia'  Do I ay marry' cries the Landlady 'many's the Time hath she lain in this House'  'With her Aunt I suppose' says  Jones'    'Why there it is now' cries the Landlady 'Ay ay ay I know the old Lady very well And a sweet young Creature is Madam  Sophia  that's the truth on't'  'A sweet Creature' cries  Jones'  Oh Heavens  Angels are painted fair to look like her  There's in her all that we believe of Heaven  Amazing Brightness Purity and Truth  Eternal Joy and everlasting Love  'And could I ever have imagined that you had known my  Sophia'  'I wish' says the Landlady 'you knew half so much of her What would you have given to have sat by her Bedside What a delicious Neck she hath Her lovely Limbs have stretched themselves in that very Bed you now lie in' 'Here cries  Jones  'hath  Sophia  ever lain here    'Ay ay here there in that very Bed' says the Landlady 'where I wish you had her this Moment and she may wish so too for any thing I know to the contrary For she hath mentioned your Name to me'    'Ha' cries he 'did she ever mention her poor  Jones  You flatter me  now I can never believe so much'  Why then' answered she 'as I hope to be saved and may the Devil fetch me if I speak a Syllable more than the Truth I have heard her mention Mr  Jones  but in a civil and modest Way I confess yet I could perceive she thought a great deal more than she said'  'O my dear Woman' cries  Jones  'her Thoughts of me I shall never be worthy of O she is all Gentleness Kindness Goodness Why was such a Rascal as I born ever to give her soft Bosom a Moment's Uneasiness Why am I cursed I who would undergo all the Plagues and Miseries which any Daemon ever invented for Mankind to procure her any Good nay Torture itself could not be Misery to me did I but know that she was happy'  'Why look you there now' says the Landlady I told her you was a constant Lover' But pray Madam tell me when or where you knew any thing of me for I never was here before nor do I remember ever to have seen you'  'Nor is it possible you should' answered she 'for you was a little Thing when I had you in my Lap at the Squire's''How the Squire's' said  Jones  what do you know the great and good Mr  Allworthy  then'  'Yes marry do I' says she 'Who in this Country doth not'    'the Fame of his Goodness indeed' answered  Jones  'must have extended farther than this but Heaven only can know him can know that Benevolence which is copied from itself and sent upon Earth as its own Pattern Mankind are as ignorant of such divine Goodness as they are unworthy of it but none so unworthy of it as myself I who was raised by him to such a Height taken in as you well must know a poor baseborn Child adopted by him and treated as his own Son to dare by my Follies to disoblige him to draw his Vengeance upon me Yes  I deserve it all For I will never be so ungrateful as even to think he hath done an Act of Injustice by me No I deserve to be turned out of Doors as I am And now Madam says he I believe you will not blame me for turning Soldier especially' with such a Fortune as this in my Pocket  At which words he shook a Purse which had but very little in it and which still appeared to the Landlady to have less  My good Landlady was according to vulgar Phrase struck all of a Heap by this Relation She answered coldly  'That to be sure People were the best Judges what was most proper for their CircumstancesBut hark' says she 'I think I hear some body call Coming coming the Devil's in all our Volk nobody hath any Ears I must go down Stairs if you want any more Breakfast' the Maid will come up Coming'  At which Words without taking any Leave she flung out of the Room For the lower Sort of People are very tenacious of Respect and tho' they are contented to give this  gratis  to Persons of Quality yet they never confer it on those of their own Order without taking Care to be paid for their Pains  CHAP III  In which the Surgeon makes his second Appearance  BEFORE we proceed any farther that the Reader may not be mistaken in imagining the Landlady knew more than she did nor surprized that she knew so much it may be necessary to inform him that the Lieutenant had acquainted her that the Name of  Sophia  had been the Occasion of the Quarrel and as for the rest of her Knowledge the sagacious Reader will observe how she came by it in the preceding Scene Great Curiosity was indeed mixed with her  Virtues and she never willingly suffered any one to depart from her House without enquiring as much as possible into their Names Families and Fortunes  She was no sooner gone than  Jones  instead of animadverting on her Behaviour reflected that he was in the same Bed which he was informed had held his dear  Sophia  This occasioned a thousand fond and tender Thoughts which we would dwell longer upon did we not consider that such kind of Lovers will make a very inconsiderable Part of our Readers  In this Situation the Surgeon found him when he came to dress his Wound The Doctor perceiving upon Examination that his Pulse was disordered and hearing that he had not slept declared that he was in great Danger For he apprehended a Fever was coming on which he would have prevented by bleeding but  Jones  would not submit declaring he would lose no more Blood and  'Doctor' says he 'if you will be so kind only to dress my Head I have no Doubt of being well in a Day or two'  'I wish' answered the Surgeon 'I could assure your being well in a Month or two Well indeed No no People are not so soon well of such Contusions but Sir I am not at this Time of Day to be instructed in my Operations by a Patient and a insist on making a Revulsion before I dress you'  Jones  persisted obstinately in his Refusal and the Doctor at last yielded telling him at the same Time that he would not be answerable for the ill Consequence and hoped he would do him the Justice to acknowledge that he had given him a contrary Advice which the Patient promised he would  The Doctor retired into the Kitchen where addressing himself to the Landlady he complained bitterly of the undutiful Behaviour of his Patient who would not be blooded though he was in a Fever  'It is an eating Fever then' says the Landlady 'For he hath devoured two swinging buttered Toasts this Morning for Breakfast'  'Very likely' says the Doctor 'I have known People eat in a Fever and it is very easily accounted for because the Acidity occasioned by the febrile Matter may stimulate the Nerves of the Diaphragm and thereby occasion a Craving which will not be easily distinguishable from a natural Appetite but the Aliment will not be concreted nor assimilated into Chyle and so will corrode the vascular Orifices and thus will aggravate the febrific Symptoms Indeed I think the Gentleman in a very dangerous Way and if he is not blooded I am afraid will die'  'Every Man must die some Time or other' answered the good Woman 'it is no Business of mine I hope Doctor you would not have me hold him while you bleed himBut harkee a Word in your Ear I would advise you before you proceed too far to take care who is to be your Paymaster'  'Paymaster said the Doctor staring why I've a Gentleman under my Hands have I not'  'I imagined so as well as you' said the Landlady 'but as my first Husband used to say every Thing is not what it looks to be He is an arrant Scrub I assure you However take no Notice that I mentioned any thing to you of the Matter but I think People in Business  oft  always to let one another know such Things'  'And have I suffered such a Fellow as this' cries the Doctor in a Passion 'to instruct me Shall I hear my Practice insulted by one who will not pay me I am glad I have made this Discovery in Time I will see now whether he will be blooded or no'  He then immediately went up Stairs  and flinging open the Door of the Chamber with much Violence awaked poor  Jones  from a very sound Nap into which he was fallen and what was still worse from a delicious dream concerning  Sophia  'Will you be blooded or no' cries the Doctor in a Rage 'I have told you my Resolution already' answered  Jones  'and I wish with all my Heart you had taken my answer For you have awaked me out of the sweetest Sleep which I ever had in my Life'  'Ay ay' cries the Doctor 'many a Man hath dosed away his Life Sleep is not always good no more than Food but remember I demand of you for the last Time will you be blooded'  'I answer you for the last Time said  Jones  I will not'  'Then I wash my Hands of you' cries the Doctor 'and I desire you to pay me for the Trouble I have had already Two Journeys at  s  each two Dressings at  s  more and half a Crown for Phlebotomy'  'I hope' said  Jones  you don't intend to leave me in this Condition'  'Indeed but I shall' said the other  'Then said  Jones  you have used me rascally and I will not pay you a farthing'  'Very well' cries the Doctor 'the first Loss is the best What a Pox did my Landlady mean by sending for me to such Vagabonds'  At which Words he flung out of the Room and his Patient turned himself about soon recovered his Sleep but his Dream was unfortunately gone  CHAP IV  In which is introduced one of the pleasantest Barbers that was ever recorded in History the Barber of  Bagdad  nor he in  Don Quixote  not excepted  THE Clock had now struck Five when  Jones  awaked from a Nap of seven Hours so much refreshed and in such perfect Health and Spirits  that he resolved to get up and dress himself for which Purpose he unlocked his Portmanteau and took out clean Linnen and a Suit of Clothes but first he slipt on a Frock and went down into the Kitchen to bespeak something that might pacify certain Tumults he found rising within his Stomach  Meeting the Landlady he accosted her with great Civility and asked  'what he could have for Dinner'  'For Dinner says she 'it is an odd Time a Day to think of Dinner There is nothing drest in the House and the Fire is almost out  Well but'  says he  'I must have something to eat and it is almost indifferent to me what For to tell you the Truth I never was more hungry in my Life'  'Then' says she 'I believe there is a Piece of cold Buttock and Carrot which will fit you'    'Nothing better' answered  Jones  'but I should be obliged to you if you would let it be fried'  To which the Landlady consented and said smiling  'she was glad to see him so well recovered'  For the Sweetness of our Heroe's Temper was almost irresistable besides she was really no illhumoured Woman at the Bottom but she loved Money so much that she hated every Thing which had the Semblance of Poverty  Jones  now returned in order to dress himself while his Dinner was preparing and was according to his Orders attended by the Barber  This Barber who went by the Name of little  Benjamin  was a Fellow of great Oddity and Humour which had frequently led him into small Inconveniencies such as Slaps in the Face Kicks in the Breech broken Bones  c  For every one doth not understand a Jest and those who do are often displeased with being themselves the Subjects of it This Vice was however incurable in him and though he had often smarted for it yet if ever he conceived a Joke he  was certain to be delivered of it without the least Respect of Persons Time or Place  He had a great many other Particularities in his Character which I shall not mention as the Reader himself will very easily perceive them on his farther Acquaintance with this extraordinary Person  Jones  being impatient to be drest for a Reason which may be easily imagined thought the Shaver was very tedious in preparing his Suds and begged him to make Haste to which the other answered with Gravity For he never discomposed his Muscles on any Account  'Festina lentè  is a Proverb which I learnt long before I ever touched a Razor'  'I find Friend you are a Scholar' replied  Jones  'A poor one' said the Barber  'non omnia possumus omnes  Again' said  Jones  'I fancy you are good at capping Verses'  Excuse me Sir' said the Barber  'non tanti me dignor honore'  And then proceeding to his Operation  'Sir' said he 'since I have dealt in Suds I could never discover more than two Reasons for shaving the one is to get a Beard and the other to get rid of one I conjecture Sir it may not be long since you were shaved from the former of these Motives Upon my Word you have had good Success for one may say of your Beard that it is  Tondenti gravior'  'I conjecture says  Jones  that thou art a very comical Fellow'  'You mistake me widely Sir' said the Barber 'I am too much addicted to the Study of Philosophy  Hinc illae lachrymae  Sir that's my Misfortune Too much Learning hath been my ruin'  'Indeed' says  Jones  'I confess Friend you have more Learning than generally belongs to your Trade but I can't see how it can have injured you'  'Alas Sir' answered the Shaver 'my Father disinherited me for it He was a DancingMaster and because I could read  before I could dance he took an Aversion to me and left every Farthing among his other ChildrenWill you please to have your TemplesO la I ask your Pardon I fancy there is  Hiatus in manuscriptis  I heard you was going to the Wars but I find it was a Mistake'  Why do you conclude so' says  Jones  Sure Sir' answered the Barber 'you are too wise a Man to carry a broken Head thither for that would be carrying Coals to  Newcastle  '  'Upon my word' cries  Jones  'thou art a very odd Fellow and I like thy Humour extremely I shall be very glad if thou wilt come to me after Dinner and drink a Glass with me I long to be' better acquainted with thee  'O dear Sir' said the Barber 'I can do you twenty times as great a Favour if you will accept of it' 'What is that my Friend' cries  Jones  'Why I will drink a Bottle with you if you please for I dearly love Goodnature and as you have found me out to be a comical Fellow so I have no Skill in Physiognomy if you are not one of the bestnatured Gentlemen in the Universe'  Jones  now walked down Stairs neatly drest and perhaps the famed  Adonis  was not a lovelier Figure and yet he had no Charms for my Landlady For as that good Woman did not resemble  Venus  at all in her Person so neither did she in her Taste Happy had it been for  Nanny  the Chambermaid if she had seen with the Eyes of her Mistress for that poor Girl fell so violently in love with  Jones  in five Minutes that her Passion afterwards cost her many a Sigh This  Nancy  was extremely pretty and altogether as coy for she had refused a Drawer and one or two young Farmers in the Neighbourhood but the bright Eyes of our Heroe thawed all her Ice in a Moment  When  Jones  returned to the Kitchen his Cloth was not yet laid nor indeed was there any Occasion  it should his Dinner remaining in  Satu quo  as did the Fire which was to dress it This Disappointment might have put many a philosopical Temper into a Passion but it had no such Effect on  Jones  He only gave the Landlady a gentle Rebuke saying  'Since it was so difficult to get it heated he would eat the Beef cold'  But now the good Woman whether moved by Compassion or by Shame or by whatever other Motive I cannot tell first gave her Servants a round Scold for disobeying the Orders which she had never given and then bidding the Drawer lay a Napkin in the Sun she set about the Matter in good earnest and soon accomplished it  This Sun into which  Jones  was now conducted was truly named as  Lucus a non lucendo  for it was an Apartment into which the Sun had scarce ever looked It was indeed the worst Room in the House and happy was it for  Jones  that it was so However he was now too hungry to find any Fault but having once satisfied his Appetite he ordered the Drawer to carry a Bottle of Wine into a better Room and expressed some Resentment at having been shewn into a Dungeon  The Drawer having obeyed his Commands he was after some Time attended by the Barber who would not indeed have suffered him to wait so long for his Company had he not been listening in the Kitchen to the Landlady who was entertaining a Circle that she had gathered round her with the History of poor  Jones  Part of which she had extracted from his own Lips and the other Part was her own ingenious Composition  'for she said he was a poor Parish Boy taken into the House of Squire  Allworthy  where he was bred up as an Apprentice and now turned out of Doors for his Misdeeds particularly for making Love to his young Mistress and probably for robbing the House for how else should he come by the little Money he hath And this'  says she 'is your Gentleman forsooth'  'A Servant of Squire  Allworthy'  says the Barber 'what's his Name  '  'Why he told me his Name was  Jones  ' says she 'perhaps he goes by a wrong Name Nay and he told me too that the Squire had maintained him as his own Son  thof  he had quarrelled with him now'  'And if his Name be  Jones  he told you the Truth' said the Barber for I have Relations who live in that Country nay and some People say he is his Son  'Why doth he not go by the Name of his Father'  'I can't tell that' said the Barber 'many People's Sons don't go by the Name of their Father'  'Nay' said the Landlady 'if I thought he was a Gentleman's Son  thof  he was a Bye Blow I should behave to him in another guess Manner for many of these Bye Blows come to be great Men and as my poor first Husband used to say Never affront any Customer that's a Gentleman'  CHAP V  A Dialogue between Mr  Jones  and the Barber  THIS Conversation passed partly while  Jones  was at Dinner in his Dungeon and partly while he was expecting the Barber in the Parlour And as soon as it was ended Mr  Benjamin  as we have said attended him and was very kindly desired to sit down  Jones  then filling out a Glass of Wine drank his Health by the Appellation of  Doctissime Tonsorum Ago tibi Gratias Domine  said the Barber and then looking very stedfastly at  Jones  he said with great Gravity and with a seeming Surprize as if he recollected a Face he had seen before  'Sir may I crave the Favour to know if your Name is not  Jones'  To which the other answered That it was  'Proh Deum at{que} Hominum Fidem'  says the Barber 'how strangely Things come to pass  Mr  Jones  I am your most obedient Servant I find you do not know me which indeed is no Wonder since you never saw me but once and then you was very young Pray Sir how doth the good Squire  Allworthy  How doth  Ille optimus omnium Patronus'  'I find' said  Jones  'you do indeed know me but I have not the like Happiness of recollecting you'    I do not wonder at that' cries  Benjamin  'but I am surprized I did not know you sooner for you are not in the least altered And pray Sir may I without Offence enquire whither you are travelling this Way  Fill the Glass Mr Barber' said  Jones  'and ask me no more Questions'  Nay Sir' answered  Benjamin  'I would not be troublesome and I hope you don't think me a Man of an impertinent Curiosity for that is a Vice which nobody can lay to my Charge but I ask Pardon for when a Gentleman of your Figure travels without his Servants we may suppose him to be as we say in  Casu incognito  and perhaps I ought not to have mentioned your Name'  'I own' says  Jones  'I did not expect to have been so well known in this Country as I find I am yet for particular Reasons I shall be obliged to you if you will not mention my Name to any other Person till I am gone from hence'  'Pauca Verba'  answered the Barber 'and I wish no other here knew you but myself for some People have Tongues but I promise you I can keep a Secret My Enemies will allow me that Virtue'  'And yet that is not the Characteristic of your Profession Mr Barber' answered  Jones  'Alas Sir' replied  Benjamin 'Non si male nunc olim sic erat  I was not born nor bred a Barber I assure you I have spent most of my Time among Gentlemen and tho' I say it I understand something of Gentility And if you had thought me as worthy of your Confidence as you have some other People  I should have shewn you I could have kept a Secret better I should not have degraded your Name in a public Kitchen for indeed Sir some People have not used you well for besides making a publick Proclamation of what you told them of a Quarrel between yourself and Squire  Allworthy  they added Lies of their own Things which I knew to be Lies  You surprize me greatly' cries  Jones'  'Upon my Word Sir answered  Benjamin  'I tell the Truth and I need not tell you my Landlady was the Person I am sure it moved me to hear the Story and I hope it is all false for I have a great Respect for you I do assure you I have and have had ever since the Goodnature you shewed to  Black George  which was talked of all over the Country and I received more than one Letter about it Indeed it made you beloved by every body You will pardon me therefore for it was real Concern at what I heard made me ask any Questions for I have no impertinent Curiosity about me but I love Goodnature and thence became  Amoris abundantia ergo Te'  Every Profession of Friendship easily gains Credit with the Miserable it is no wonder therefore if  Jones  who besides his being miserable was extremely openhearted very readily believed all the Professions of  Benjamin  and received him into his Bosom The Scraps of  Latin  some of which  Benjamin  applied properly enough though it did not favour of profound Literature seemed yet to indicate something superior to a common Barber and so indeed did his whole Behaviour  Jones  therefore believed the Truth of what he said as to his Original and Education and at length after much Entreaty he said  'Since you have heard my Friend so much of my Affairs and seem so desirous to know the  Truth if you will have Patience to hear it I will inform you of the whole'  'Patience' cries  Benjamin  'that I will if the Chapter was never so long and I am very much obliged to you for the Honour you do me'  Jones  now began and related the whole History forgetting only a Circumstance or two namely every thing which passed on that Day in which he had fought with  Thwackum  and ended with his Resolution to go to Sea till the Rebellion in the North had made him change his Purpose and had brought him to the Place where he then was  Little  Benjamin  who had been all Attention never once interrupted the Narrative but when it was ended he could not help observing that there must be surely something more invented by his Enemies and told Mr  Allworthy  against him or so good a Man would never have dismissed one he had loved so tenderly in such a Manner To which  Jones  answered  'He doubted not but such villanous Arts had been made use of to destroy him'  And surely it was scarce possible for any one to have avoided making the same Remark with the Barber who had not indeed heard from  Jones  one single Circumstance upon which he was condemned for his Actions were not now placed in those injurious Lights in which they had been misrepresented to  Allworthy  Nor could he mention those many false Accusations which had been from time to time preferred against him to  Allworthy  for with none of these was he himself acquainted He had likewise as we have observed omitted many material Facts in his present Relation Upon the whole indeed every thing now appeared in such favourable Colours to  Jones  that Malice it self would have found it no easy Matter to fix any Blame upon him  Not that  Jones  desired to conceal or to disguise the Truth nay he would have been more unwilling to have suffered any Censure to fall on Mr  Allworthy  for punishing him than on his own Actions for deserving it but in Reality so it happened and so it always will happen For let a Man be never so honest the Account of his own Conduct will in Spite of himself be so very favourable that his Vices will come purified through his Lips and like foul Liquors well strained will leave all their Foulness behind For tho' the Facts themselves may appear yet so different will be the Motives Circumstances and Consequences when a Man tells his own Story and when his Enemy tells it that we scarce can recognize the Facts to be one and the same  Tho' the Barber had drank down this Story with greedy Ears he was not yet satisfied There was a Circumstance behind which his Curiosity cold as it was most eagerly longed for  Jones  had mentioned the Fact of his Amour and of his being the Rival of  Blifil  but had cautiously concealed the Name of the young Lady The Barber therefore after some Hesitation and many Hums and Ha's at last begged Leave to crave the Name of the Lady who appeared to be the principal Cause of all this Mischief  Jones  paused a Moment and then said  'Since I have trusted you with so much and since I am afraid her Name is become too public already on this Occasion I will not conceal it from you Her Name is  Sophia Western'  'Proh Deum atque Hominum Fidem  Squire  Western  hath a Daughter grown a Woman'  'Ay and such a Woman' cries  Jones  'that the World cannot match No Eye ever saw any thing so beautiful but that is her least Excellence Such Sense such Goodness O I could praise her for ever and yet should omit half her Virtues'  'Mr  Western  a Daughter grown up' cries the  Barber 'I remember the Father a Boy well  Tempus edax Rerum'  The Wine being now at an End the Barber pressed very eagerly to be his Bottle but  Jones  absolutely refused saying  'He had already drank more than he ought and that he now chose to retire to his Room where he wished he could procure himself a Book'  'A Book' cries  Benjamin  'what Book would you have  Latin  or  English  I have some curious Books in both Languages Such as  Erasmi Colloquia Ovid de Tristibus Gradus ad Parnassum  and in  English  I have several of the best Books tho' some of them are a little torn but I have a great Part of  Stow  's Chronicle the sixth Volume of  Pope  's  Homer  the third Volume of the Spectator the second Volume of  Echard  's  Roman  History the Craftsman  Robinson Crusoe Thomas a Kempis  and two Volumes of  Tom Brown  's Works'  'Those last' cries  Jones  'are Books I never saw so if you please to lend me one of those Volumes'  The Barber assured him he would be highly entertained for he looked upon the Author to have been one of the greatest Wits that ever the Nation produced He then stepped to his House which was hard by and immediately returned after which the Barber having received very strict Injunctions of Secrecy from  Jones  and having sworn inviolably to maintain it they separated the Barber went home and  Jones  retired to his Chamber  CHAP VI  In which more of the Talents of Mr  Benjamin  will appear as well as who this extraordinary Person was  IN the Morning  Jones  grew a little uneasy at the Desertion of his Surgeon as he apprehended some  Inconvenience or even Danger might attend the not Dressing his Wound he enquired therefore of the Drawer what other Surgeons were to be met with in that Neighbourhood The Drawer told him there was one not far off but he had known him often refuse to be concerned after another had been sent for before him  'but Sir' says he 'if you will take my Advice there is not a Man in the Kingdom can do your Business better than the Barber who was with you last Night We look upon him to be one of the ablest Men at a Cut in all this Neighbourhood For tho' he hath not been here above three Months he hath done several great Cures'  The Drawer was presently dispatched for little  Benjamin  who being acquainted in what Capacity he was wanted prepared himself accordingly and attended but with so different an Air and Aspect from that which he wore when his Bason was under his Arm that he could scarce be known to be the same Person  'So Tonsor' says  Jones  'I find you have more Trades than one how came you not to inform me of this last Night A Surgeon'  answered  Benjamin  with great Gravity  'is a Profession not a Trade The Reason why I did not acquaint you last Night that I professed this Art was that I then concluded you was under the Hands of another Gentleman and I never love to interfere with my Brethren in their Business  Ars omnibus communis  but now Sir if you please I will inspect your Head and when I see into your Skull I will give my Opinion of your Case'  Jones  had no great Faith in this new Professor however he suffered him to open the Bandage and to look at his Wound which as soon as he had done  Benjamin  began to groan and shake his Head violently Upon which  Jones  in a peevish Manner bid  him not play the Fool but tell him in what Condition he found him  'Shall I answer you as a Surgeon or a Friend' said  Benjamin  'As a Friend and seriously' said  Jones  'Why then upon my Soul' cries  Benjamin  'it would require a great deal of Art to keep you from being well after a very few Dressings and if you will suffer me to apply some Salve of mine I will answer for the Success'  Jones  gave his Consent and the Plaister was applied accordingly  'There Sir' cries  Benjamin  'now I will if you please resume my former Self but a Man is obliged to keep up some Dignity in his Countenance whilst he is performing these Operations or the World will not submit to be handled by him You can't imagine Sir of how much Consequence a grave Aspect is to a grave Character A Barber may make you laugh but a Surgeon ought rather to make you cry'  'Mr  Barber  or Mr  Surgeon  or Mr  BarberSurgeon  said  Jones'    'O dear Sir' answered  Benjamin  interrupting him  'Infandum Regina jubes renovare Dolorem  You recal to my Mind that cruel Separation of the united Fraternities so much to the Prejudice of both Bodies as all Separations must be according to the old Adage  Vis unita fortior  which to be sure there are not wanting some of one or of the other Fraternity who are able to construe What a Blow was this to me who unite both in my own Person'Well by whatever Name you please to be called'  continued  Jones  'you certainly are one of the oddest most comical Fellows I ever met with and must have something very surprizing in your Story which you must confess I have a Right to hear'  'I  do confess it' answered  Benjamin  'and will very readily acquaint you with it when you have sufficient Leisure for I promise you it will require a good deal of Time'  Jones  told him he could never be more at Leisure than at present  'Well then' said  Benjamin  'I will obey you but first I will fasten the Door that none may interrupt us'  He did so and then advancing with a solemn Air to  Jones  said  'I must begin by telling you Sir that you yourself have been the greatest Enemy I ever had'  Jones  was a little startled at this sudden Declaration  'I your Enemy Sir'  says he with much Amazement and some Sternness in his Look  'Nay be not angry' said  Benjamin  'for I promise you I am not You are perfectly innocent of having intended me any Wrong for you was then an Infant but I shall I believe unriddle all this the Moment I mention my Name Did you never hear Sir of one  Partridge  who had the Honour of being reputed your Father and the Misfortune of being ruined by that Honour'  'I have indeed heard of that  Partridge'  says  Jones  'and have always believed myself to be his Son'  'Well Sir' answered  Benjamin  'I am that  Partridge  but I hear absolve you from all filial Duty for I do assure you you are no Son of mine'  'How' replied  Jones  'and is it possible that a false Suspicion should have drawn all the ill Consequences upon you with which I am too well acquainted'  'It is possible' cries  Benjamin  'for it is so but tho' it is natural enough for Men to hate even the innocent Causes of their Sufferings yet I am of a different Temper I have loved you ever since I heard of your Behaviour to  Black George  as I told you and am convinced from this extraordinary Meeting that you are born to make me Amends for all I have suffered on that Account Besides I  dreamt the Night before I saw you that I stumbled over a Stool without hurting myself which plainly shewed me something good was towards me and last Night I dreamt again that I rode behind you on a Milk white Mare which is a very excellent Dream and betokens much good Fortune which I am resolved to pursue unless you have the Cruelty to deny me'  'I should be very glad Mr  Partridge'  answered  'Jones  'to have it in my Power to make you Amends for your Sufferings on my Account tho' at present I see no Likelihood of it however I assure you I will deny you nothing which is in my Power to grant'  'It is in your Power sure enough' replied  Benjamin  'for I desire nothing more than Leave to attend you in this Expedition Nay I have so entirely set my Heart upon it that if you should refuse me you will kill both a Barber and a Surgeon in one Breath'  Jones  answered smiling That he should be very sorry to be the Occasion of so much Mischief to the Public He then advanced many prudential Reasons in order to dissuade  Benjamin  whom we shall hereafter call  Partridge  from his Purpose but all were in vain  Partridge  relied strongly on his Dream of the milkwhite Mare  'Besides Sir says he I promise you I have as good an Inclination to the Cause as any Man can possibly have and go I will whether you admit me to go in your Company or not'  Jones  who was as much pleased with  Partridge  as  Partridge  could be with him and who had not consulted his own Inclination but the Good of the other in desiring him to stay behind when he found his Friend so resolute at last gave his Consent but then recollecting himself he said  'Perhaps' Mr  Partridge  you think I shall be able to support you but I really am not'  and then taking out his Purse he told out nine Guineas which he declared were his whole Fortune  Partridge  answered  'that his Dependance was only on his future Favour For he was thoroughly convinced he would shortly have enough in his Power At present Sir said he I believe I am rather the richer Man of the two but all I have is at your Service and at your Disposal I insist upon your taking the whole and I beg only to attend you in the Quality of your Servant  Nil desperandum est Teucro duce et auspice Teucro'  But to this generous Proposal concerning the Money  Jones  would by no means submit  It was resolved to set out the next Morning when a Difficulty arose concerning the Baggage for the Portmanteau of Mr  Jones  was too large to be carried without a Horse  'If I may presume to give my Advice' says  Partridge  'this Portmanteau with every Thing in it except a few Shirts should be left behind Those I shall be easily able to carry for you and the res  of your Clothes will remain very safely locked up' in my House  This Method was no sooner proposed than agreed to and then the Barber departed in order to prepare  every Thing for his intended Expedition  CHAP VII  Containing better Reasons than any which have yet appeared for the Conduct of  Partridge  an Apology for the Weakness of  Jones  and some farther Anecdotes concerning my Landlady  THOUGH  Partridge  was one of the most superstitious of Men he would hardly perhaps  have desired to accompany  Jones  on his Expedition  erely from the Omens of the Jointstool and white  are if his Prospect had been no better than to have  ared the Plunder gained in the Field of Battle In  ct when  Partridge  came to ruminate on the Re  ion he had heard from  Jones  he could not recon  e to himself that Mr  Allworthy  should turn his  n for so he most firmly believed him to be out of  oors for any Reason which he had heard assigned  e concluded therefore that the whole was a Ficti  and that  Jones  of whom he had often from his  orrespondents heard the wildest Character had in  ality run away from his Father It came into his  ead therefore that if he could prevail with the  ung Gentleman to return back to his Father he  ould by that Means render a Service to  Allworthy  which would obliterate all his former Anger nay  deed he conceived that very Anger was counterfeit  and that  Allworthy  had sacrificed him to his own  eputation And this Suspicion indeed he well ac  unted for from the tender Behaviour of that ex  llent Man to the Foundling Child from his great verity to  Partridge  who knowing himself to be in  cent could not conceive that any other should  nk him guilty lastly from the Allowance which had privately received long after the Annuity had  en publicly taken from and which he looked upon a kind of Smartmoney or rather by way of  tonement for Injustice For it is very uncommon believe for Men to ascribe the Benefactions they  ceive to pure Charity when they can possibly im  te them to any other Motive If he could by any  eans therefore persuade the young Gentleman to  turn home he doubted not but that he should again received into the Favour of  Allworthy  and well warded for his Pains nay and should be again re  red to his native Country a Restoration which  Ulysses  himself never wished more heartily than poor  Partridge  As for  Jones  he was well satisfied with the Truth of what the other had asserted and believed that  Partridge  had no other Inducements but Love to him and Zeal for the Cause A blameable Want of Caution and Diffidence in the Veracity of others in which he was highly worthy of Censure To say the Truth there are but two Ways by which Men become possessed of this excellent Quality The one is from long Experience and the other is from Nature which last I presume is often meant by Genius or great natural Parts and it is infinitely the better of the two not only as we are Masters of i  much earlier in Life but as it is much more infallible and conclusive For a Man who hath been imposed on by ever so many may still hope to find others more honest whereas he who receives certain necessary Admonitions from within that this is impossible must have very little Understanding indeed if he ever renders himself liable to be once deceived As  Jones  had not this Gift from Nature he was too young to have gained it by Experience for at the diffident Wisdom which is to be acquired this Way we seldom arrive till very late in Life which is perhaps the Reason why some old Men are apt to despise the Understandings of all those who are a little younger than themselves  Jones  spent most Part of the Day in the Company of a new Acquaintance This was no other than the Landlord of the House or rather the Husband of the Landlady He had but lately made his Descent down Stairs after a long Fit of the Gout in which Distemper he was generally confined to his Room during one half of the Year and during the rest he walked about the House smoaked his Pipe and drank his Bottle with his Friends without concerning himself  in the least with any Kind of Business He had  en bred as they call it a Gentleman that is bred  to do nothing and had spent a very small For  ne which he inherited from an industrious Farmer  Uncle in Hunting Horseracing and Cock  ghting and had been married by my Landlady for  tain Purposes which he had long desisted from an  ering for which she hated him heartily But as  was a surly Kind of Fellow so she contented her  f with frequently upbraiding him by disadvantage  s Comparisons with her first Husband whose Praise  e had eternally in her Mouth and as she was for  e most part Mistress of the Profit so she was sa  fied to take upon herself the Care and Government  the Family and after a long successless Struggle  suffer her Husband to be Master of himself  In the Evening when  Jones  retired to his Room a  all Dispute arose between this fond Couple concern  g him  'What' says the Wife 'you have been  tipling with the Gentleman I see'  'Yes' an  wered the Husband 'we have cracked a Bottle together and a very Gentlemanlike Man he is and hath a very pretty Notion of Horseflesh Indeed  he is young and hath not seen much of the World For I believe he hath been at very few Horseraces'  O ho he is one of your Order is he' replies the  ndlady 'he must be a Gentleman to be sure if he is a Horseracer The Devil fetch such Gentry I am sure I wish I had never seen any of them I have Reason to love Horseracers truly'  'That you have says the Husband for I was one you know'  'Yes answered she 'You are a pure one indeed As my first Husband used to say I may put all the Good I have ever got by you in my Eyes and see never the worse'  'Dn your first Husband' cries he'    'Don't dn a better Man than yourself' answered the Wife 'if he had been  alive you durst not have done it'  'Then you think' says he 'I have not so much Courage as yourself For you have dn'd him often in my Hearing  'If I did' says she 'I have repented of it many's the good Time and oft And if he was so good to forgive me a Word spoken in Haste or so it doth not become such a one as you to  twitter  me He was a Husband to me he was and if ever I did make use of an ill Word or so in a Passion I never called him a Rascal I should have told a Lie if I had called him a Rascal'  Much more she said but not in his Hearing For having lighted his Pipe he staggered off as fast as he could We shall therefore transcribe no more of her Speech as it approached still nearer and nearer to a Subject too indelicate to find any Place in this History  Early in the Morning  Partridge  appeared at the Bedside of  Jones  ready equipped for the Journey with his Knapsack at his Back This was his own Workmanship for besides his other Trades he was no indifferent Taylor He had already put up his whole Stock of Linnen in it consisting of four Shirts to which he now added eight for Mr  Jones  and then packing up the Portmanteau he was departing with it towards his own House but was stopt in his Way by the Landlady who refused to suffer any Removals till after the Payment of the reckoning  The Landlady was as we have said absolute Governess in these Regions it was therefore necessary to comply with her Rules so the Bill was presently writ out which amounted to a much large  Sum than might have been expected from the Entertainment which  Jones  had met with but here we are obliged to disclose some Maxims which Publicans hold to be the grand Mysteries of their Trade The first is if they have any Thing good in their House which indeed very seldom happens to produce i  only to Persons who travel with great Equipages  dly To charge the same for the very worst Provisions as if they were the best And lastly if any of their Guests call but for little to make them pay a double Price for every Thing they have so that the Amount by the Head may be much the same  The Bill being made and discharged  Jones  set forward with  Partridge  carrying his Knapsack nor did the Landlady condescend to wish him a good Journey for this was it seems an Inn frequented by People of Fashion and I know not whence it is but all those who get their Livelihood by People of Fashion contract as much Insolence to the rest of Mankind as if they really belonged to that Rank themselves  CHAP VIII Jones  arrives at  Gloucester  and goes to the  Bell  the Character of that House and of a Pettyfogger which he there meets with  MR  Jones  and  Partridge  or  Little Benjamin  which Epithet of  Little  was perhaps given him ironically he being in reality near six Feet high having left their last Quarters in the Manner before described travelled on to  Gloucester  without meeting any Adventure worth relating  Being arrived here they chose for their House of Entertainment the Sign of the  Bell  an excellent House indeed and which I do most seriously recommend to every Reader who shall visit this ancient City The Master of it is Brother to the great Preacher  Whitefield  but is absolutely untainted with the per  icious Principles of Methodism or of any other heretical Sect He is indeed a very honest plain Man and in my Opinion not likely to create any Disturbance either in Church or State His Wife hath I believe had much Pretension to Beauty and is still a very fine Woman Her Person and Deportment might have made a shining Figure in the politest Assemblies  but though she must be conscious of this and many other Perfections she seems perfectly contented with and resigned to that State of Life to which she is called and this Resignation is entirely owing to the Prudence and Wisdom of her Temper For she is at present as free from any methodistical Notions as her Husband I say at present For she freely confesses that her Brother's Documents made at first some Impression upon her and that she had put herself to the Expence of a long Hood in order to attend the extraordinary Emotions of the Spirit but having found during an Experiment of three Weeks no Emotions she says worth a Farthing she very wisely laid by her Hood and abandoned the Sect To be concise she is a very friendly goodnatured Woman and so industrious to oblige that the Guests must be of a very morose Disposition who are not extremely well satisfied in her House  Mrs  Whitefield  happened to be in the Yard when  Jones  and his Attendant marched in Her Sagacity soon discovered in the Air of our Hero something which distinguished him from the Vulgar She ordered her Servants therefore immediately to shew him into a Room and presently afterwards invited him to Dinner with herself which Invitation he very thankfully accepted For indeed much less agreeable Company than that of Mrs  Whitefield  and a  much worse Entertainment than she had provided would have been welcome after so long fasting and so long a Walk  Besides Mr  Jones  and the good Governess of the Mansion there sat down at Table an Attorney o  Salisbury  indeed the very same who had brought the News of Mrs  Blifil  's Death to Mr  Allworthy  an  whose Name which I think we did not before mention was  Dowling  there was likewise presen  another Person who stiled himself a Lawyer an  who lived somewhere near  Lidlinch  in  Somersetshire  This Fellow I say stiled himself a Lawyer but was indeed a most vile Pettyfogger without Sense or Knowledge of any Kind one of those who may be termed Trainbearers to the Law a Sort of Supernumeraries in the Profession who are the Hackneys of Attornies and will ride more Miles for half a Crown than a Postboy  During the time of Dinner the  Somersetshire  Lawyer recollected the Face of  Jones  which he had seen at Mr  Allworthy  's For he had often visited in that Gentleman's Kitchen He therefore took Occasion to enquire after the good Family there with that Familiarity which would have become an intimate Friend or Acquaintance of Mr  Allworthy  and indeed he did all in his Power to insinuate himself to be such though he had never had the Honour of speaking to any Person in that Family higher than the Butler  Jones  answered all his Questions with much Civility though he never remembred to have seen the Pettyfogger before and though he concluded from the outward Appearance and Behaviour of the Man that he usurped a Freedom with his Betters to which he was by no means intitled  As the Conversation of Fellows of this Kind is of all others the most detestable to Men of any Sense the Cloth was no sooner removed than Mr  Jones  withdrew and a little barbarously left poor Mrs  Whitefield  to do a Penance which I have often heard Mr  Timothy Harris  and other Publicans of good Taste lament as the severest Lot annexed to their Calling namely that of being obliged to keep Company with their Guests  Jones  had no sooner quitted the Room than the Pettyfogger in a whispering Tone asked Mrs  Whitefield  'if she knew who that fine Spark was'  She answered  'she had never seen the Gentleman before The Gentleman indeed' replied the  Pettyfogger 'a pretty Gentleman truly Why he's the Bastard of a Fellow who was hanged for Horsestealing He was dropt at Squire  Allworthy  's Door where one of the Servants found him in a Box so full of Rainwater that he would certainly have been drowned had he not been reserved for another Fate'  Ay ay you need not mention it I protest we understand what that Fate is very well'  cried  Dowling  with a most facetious Grin  'Well' continued the other 'the Squire ordered him to be taken in For he is a timbersome Man every Body knows and was afraid of drawing himself into a Scrape and there the Bastard was bred up and fed and cloathified all to the World like any Gentleman and there he got one of the Servant Maids with Child and persuaded her to swear it to the Squire himself and afterwards he broke the Arm of one Mr  Thwackum  a Clergyman only because he reprimanded him for following Whores and afterwards he snapt a Pistol at Mr  Blifil  behind his Back and once when Squire  Allworthy  was sick he got a Drum and beat it all over the House to prevent him from sleeping And twenty other Pranks he hath played for all which about four or five Days ago just before I left the Country the Squire strip'd him stark naked and turned him out of Doors  'And very justly too I protest' cries  Dowling  'I would turn my own Son out of Doors if he was guilty of half as much And pray what is the' Name of this pretty Gentleman  'The Name o'un' answered Pettyfogger 'why he is a called  Thomas Jones'  Jones'  answered  Dowling  a little eagerly 'what Mr  Jones  that lived at Mr  Allworthy  's was that the Gentleman that dined with us' 'The very same' said the other 'I have heard of the Gentleman' cries  Dowling  'often but I never  heard any ill Character of him' 'And I am sure' says Mrs  Whitefield  'if half what this Gentleman hath said be true Mr  Jones  hath the most deceitful Countenance I ever saw for sure his Looks promise something very different and I must say for the little I have seen of him he is as civil a wellbred Man as you would wish to converse with'  Pettyfogger calling to mind that he had not been sworn as he usually was before he gave his Evidence now bound what he had declared with so many Oaths and Imprecations that the Lady's Ears were shocked and she put a Stop to his swearing by assuring him of her Belief Upon which he said  'I hope Madam you imagine I would scorn to tell such Things of any Man unless I knew them to be true What Interest have I in taking away the Reptutation of a Man who never injured me I promise you every Syllable of what I have said is Fact and the whole Country knows it'  As Mrs  Whitefield  had no Reason to suspect that the Pettyfogger had any Motive or Temptation to abuse  Jones  the Reader cannot blame her for believing what he so confidently affirmed with many Oaths She accordingly gave up her Skill in Physiognomy and henceforwards conceived so ill an Opinion of her Guest that she heartily wished him out of her House  This Dislike was now farther increased by a Report which Mr  Whitefield  made from the Kitchen where  Partridge  had informed the Company  'That tho' he carried the Knapsack and contented himself with staying among Servants while  Tom Jones  as he called him was regaling in the Parlour he was not his Servant but only a Friend and Companion and as good a Gentleman as Mr  Jones  himself'  Dowling  sat all this while silent biting his Fingers making Faces grinning and looking wonderfully arch at last he opened his Lips and protested that the Gentleman looked like another Sort of Man He then called for his Bill with the utmost Haste declared he must be at  Hertford  that Evening lamenting his great Hurry of Business and wished he could divide himself into twenty Pieces in order to be at once in twenty Places  The Pettyfoggar now likewise departed and then  Jones  desired the Favour of Mrs  Whitefield  's Company to drink Tea with him but she refused and with a Manner so different from that with which she had received him at Dinner that it a little surprized him And now he perceived her Behaviour totally changed for instead of that natural Affability which we have before celebrated she wore a constrained Severity on her Countenance which was so disagreeable to Mr  Jones  that he resolved however late to quit the House that Evening  He did indeed account somewhat unfairly for this sudden Change for besides some hard and unjust Surmises concerning Female Fickleness and Mutability he began to suspect that he owed this want of Civility to his Want of Horses a Sort of Animals which as they dirty no Sheets are thought in Inns to pay better for their Beds than their Riders and are therefore considered as the more desirable Company but Mrs  Whitefield  to do her Justice had a much more liberal Way of thinking She was perfectly wellbred and could be very civil to a Gentleman tho' he walked on Foot In Reality she looked on our Heroe as a sorry Scoundrel and therefore treated him as such for which not even  Jones  himself had he known as much as the Reader could have blamed her nay on the Contrary he must have approved her Conduct and have esteemed her the more for the Disrespect shewn towards himself This is indeed  a most aggravating Circumstance which attends unjustly depriving Men of their Reputation for a Man who is Conscious of having an ill Character cannot justly be angry with those who neglect and slight him but ought rather to despise those that affect his Conversation unless where a perfect Intimacy must have convinced them that their Friend's Character hath been falsely and injuriously aspersed  This was not however the Case of  Jones  for as he was a perfect Stranger to the Truth so he was with good Reason offended at the Treatment he received He therefore paid his Reckoning and departed highly against the Will of Mr  Partridge  who having remonstrated much against it to no Purpose at last condescended to take up his Knapsack and to attend his Friend  CHAP IX  Containing several Dialogues between  Jones  and  Partridge  concerning Love Cold Hunger and other Matters with the lucky and narrow Escape of  Partridge  as he was on the very Brink of making a fatal Discovery to his Friend  THE Shadows began now to descend larger from the high Mountains The feather'd Creation had betaken themselves to their Rest Now the highest Order of Mortals were sitting down to their Dinners and the lowest Order to their Suppers In a Word the Clock struck five just as Mr  Jones  took his Leave of  Gloucester  an Hour at which as it was now Midwinter the dirty Fingers of Night would have drawn her sable Curtain over the Universe had not the Moon forbid her who now with a Face as broad and as red as those of some jolly Mortals who like her turn Night into Day began to rise from her Bed where she had slumbered away the Day in order to sit up all Night  Jones  had not travelled far before he paid his Compliments to that beautiful Planet  and turning to his Companion asked him If he had ever beheld so delicious an Evening  Partride  making no ready Answer to his Question he proceeded to comment on the Beauty of the Moon and repeated some Passages from  Milton  who hath certainly excelled all other Poets in his Description of the heavenly Luminaries He then told  Partridge  the Story from the  Spectator  of two Lovers who had agreed to entertain themselves when they were at a great Distance from each other by repairing at a certain fixed Hour to look at the Moon thus pleasing themselves with the Thought that they were both employed in contempiating the same Object at the same Time  'Those Lovers' added he 'must have had Souls truly capable of feeling all the Tenderness of the sublimest of all human Passions'  'Very probably' cries  Partridge  'but I envy them more if they had Bodies incapable of feeling cold for I am almost frozen to Death and am very much afraid I shall lose a Piece of my Nose before we get to another House of Entertainment Nay truly we may well expect some Judgment should happen to us for our Folly in running away so by Night from one of the most excellent Inns I ever set my Foot into I am sure I never saw more good Things in my Life and the greatest Lord in the Land cannot live better in his own House than he may there And to forsake such a House and go a rambling about the Country the Lord knows whither  per devia rura viarum  I say nothing for my Part but some People might not have Charity enough to conclude we were in our sober Senses'  'Fie upon it Mr  Partridge'  says  Jones  'have a better Heart consider you are going to face an Enemy and are you afraid of facing a little Cold I wish indeed we had a Guide to advise which of these Roads we should take'  'May I be so bold' says  Partridge  'to offer my Advice  Interdum  Stultus opportuna loquitur'  'Why which of them' cries  Jones  'would you recommend'  'Truly neither of them' answered  Partridge  'The only Road we can be certain of finding is the Road we came A good hearty Pace will bring us back to  Gloucester  in an Hour but if we go forward the Lord  Harry  knows when we shall arrive at any Place for I see at least fifty Miles before me and no House in all the Way'  'You see indeed a very fair Prospect' says  Jones  'which receives great additional Beauty from the extream Lustre of the Moon However I will keep the Lefthand Track as that seems to lead directly to those Hills which we were informed lie not far from  Worcester  And here if you incline to quit me you may and return back again but for my Part I am resolved to go forward'  'It is unkind in you Sir' says  Partridge  'to suspect me of any such Intention What I have advised hath been as much on your Account as on my own but since you are determined to go on I am as much determined to follow'  I prae sequar te  They now travelled some Miles without speaking to each other during which Suspence of Discourse  Jones  often sighed and  Benjamin  groaned as bitterly tho' from a very different Reason At length  Jones  made a full Stop and turning about cries  'Who knows  Partridge  but the loveliest Creature in the Universe may have her Eyes now fixed on that very Moon which I behold at this Instant'  'Very likely Sir answered  Partridge  and if my Eyes were fixed on a good Surloin of roast Beef the Devil might take the Moon and her Horns into the Bargain'  Did ever  Tramontane  make such an Answer'  cries  Jones  'Prithee  Partridge  wast thou never susceptible of Love in thy Life or hath Time worn away all the Traces of it from thy Memory'  'Alackaday' cries  Partridge  well would it have been for me if I had never known what Love was  Infandum Regina jubes renovare  'Dolorem  I am sure I have tasted all the Tenderness and Sublimities and Bitternesses of the Pason'  'Was your Mistress unkind then' says  Jones  'Very unkind indeed Sir' answered  Partridge  'for she married me and made one of the most confounded Wives in the World However Heaven be praised she's gone and if I believed she was in the Moon according to a Book I once read which teaches that to be the Receptacle of departed Spirits I would never look at it for fear of seeing her but I wish Sir that the Moon was a Lookingglass for your Sake and that Miss  Sophia Western  was now placed before it'  'My dear  Partridge'  cries  Jones  'what a Thought was there A thought which I am certain could never have entered into any Mind but that of a Lover O  Partridge  could I hope once again to see that Face but alas all those golden Dreams are vanished for ever and my only Refuge from future Misery is to forget the Object of all my former Happiness'  'And do you really despair of ever seeing Mifs  Western  again'  answered  Partridge  'if you will follow my Advice I will engage you shall not only see her but have her in your Arms'  'Ha do not awaken a Though of that Nature' cries  Jones  'I have struggled sufficiently to conquer all such Wishes already  'Nay answered  Partridge  'if you do not wish to have your Mistress in your Arms you are a most extraordinary Lover indeed'  Well well' says  Jones  'let us avoid this Subject but pray what is your Advice'  'To give it you in the military Phrase then' says  Partridge'  as we are Soldiers To the Right about' 'Let us return the Way we came we may yet reach  Gloucester  to Night tho' late whereas if we proceed we are likely for ought I see to ramble about for ever with out coming either to House or Home' I have already told you my Resolution is to go on'  answered  Jones  'but I would have you go back I am obliged to you for your company hither and I beg you to accept a Guinea as a small Instance of my Gratitude Nay it would be cruel in me to suffer you to go any farther for to deal plainly with you my chief End and Desire is a glorious Death in the Service of my King and Country'  'As for your Money' replied  Partridge  'I beg Sir you will put it up I will receive none of you at this Time for at present I am I believe the richer Man of the two And as your Resolution is to go on so mine is to follow you if you do Nay now my presence appears absolutely necessary to take Care of you since your Intentions are so desperate for I promise you my Views are much more prudent As you are resolved to fall in Battle if you can so I am resolved as firmly to come to no Hurt if I can help it And indeed I have the Comfort to think there will be but little Danger for a Popish Priest told me the other Day the Business would soon be over and he believed without a Battle'  A popish Priest' cries  Jones  'I have heard is not always to be believed when he speaks in Behalf of his Religion'  'Yes but so far' answered the other 'from speaking in Behalf of his Religion he assured me the Catholicks did not expect to be any Gainers by the Change for that Prince  Charles  was as good a Protestant as any in  England  and that nothing but Regard to Right made him and the rest of the popish Party to be  Jacobites'  'I believe him to be as much a Protestant as I believe he hath any Right' says  Jones  'and I make no Doubt of our Success but not without a Battle So that I am not so sanguine as your Friend the popish Priest'  'Nay to be sure Sir' answered  Parridge  'all the Prophecies I have ever read speak of a great deal of Blood to be spilt in the Quarrel and the Miller with three Thumbs who  is now alive is to hold the Horses of three Kings up to his Knees in Blood Lord have Mercy upon us all and send better Times'  'With what Stuff and Nonsense hast thou filled thy Head' answered  Jones  This too I suppose comes from the popish Priest Monsters and Prodigies are the proper Arguguments to support monstrous and absurd Doctrines The Cause of King  George  is the Cause of Liberty and true Religion In other Words it is the Cause of common Sense my Boy and I warrant you will succeed tho'  Briareus  himself was to rise again with his hundred Thumbs and to turn Miller'  Partridge  made no Reply to this He was indeed cast in the utmost Confusion by this Declaration of  Jones  For to inform the Reader of a Secret which we had no Opportunity of revealing before  Partridge  was in Truth a  Jacobite  and had concluded that  Jones  was of the same Party and was now proceeding to join the Rebels An Opinion which was not without Foundation For the tall longsided Dame mentioned by  Hudibras  that manyeyed manytongued manymouthed manyeared Monster of  Virgil  had related the Story of the Quarrel between  Jones  and the Officer with her usual Regard to Truth She had indeed changed the Name of  Sophia  into that of the Pretender and had reported that drinking his Health was the Cause for which  Jones  was knocked down This  Partridge  had heard and most firmly believed 'Tis no Wonder therefore that he had thence entertained the abovementioned Opinion of  Jones  and which he had almost discovered to him before he found out his own Mistake And at this the Reader will be the less inclined to wonder if he pleases to recollect the doubtful Phrase in which  Jones  first communicated his Resolution to Mr  Partridge  and indeed had the Words been less ambiguous  Partridge  might very well have construed them as he did being persuaded as he was that  the whole Nation were of the same Inclination in their Hearts Nor did it stagger him that  Jones  had travelled in the Company of Soldiers for he had the same Opinion of the Army which he had of the rest of People  But however well affected he might be to  James  or  Charles  he was still much more attached to  Little Benjamin  than to either for which Reason he no sooner discovered the Principles of his Fellowtraveller than he thought proper to conceal and outwardly to give up his own to the Man on whom he depended for the making his Fortune since he by no means believed the Affairs of  Jones  to be so desperate as they really were with Mr  Allworthy  for as he had kept a constant Correspondence with some of his Neighbours since he left that Country he had heard much indeed more than was true of the great Affection Mr  Allworthy  bore this young Man who as  Partridge  had been instructed was to be that Gentleman's Heir and whom as we have said he did not in the least doubt to be his Son  He imagined therefore that whatever Quarrel was between them it would be certainly made up at the Return of Mr  Jones  an Event from which he promised great Advantages if he could take this Opportunity of ingratiating himself with that young Gentleman and if he could by any Means be instrumental in procuring his Return he doubted not as we have before said but it would as highly advance him in the Favour of Mr  Allworthy  We have already observed that he was a very goodnatured Fellow and he hath himself declared the violent Attachment he had to the Person and Character of  Jones  but possibly the Views which I have just before mentioned might likewise have some little Share in prompting him to undertake this Expepedition at least in urging him to continue it after he had discovered that his Master and himself like  some prudent Fathers and Sons tho' they travelled together in great Friendship had embraced opposite Parties I am led into this Conjecture by having remarked that tho' Love Friendship Esteem and such like have very powerful Operations in the human Mind Interest however is an Ingredient seldom omitted by wise Men when they would work others to their own Purposes This is indeed a most excellent Medicine and like  Ward  's Pill flies at once to the particular Part of the Body on which you desire to operate whether it be the Tongue the Hand or any other Member where it scarce ever fails of immediately producing the desired Effect  CHAP X  In which our Travellers meet with a very extraordinary Adventure  JUST as  Jones  and his Friend came to the End of their Dialogue in the preceding Chapter they arrived at the Bottom of a very steep Hill Here  Jones  stopt short and directing his Eyes upwards stood for a while silent At length he called to his Companion and said  'Partridge  I wish I was at the Top of this Hill it must certainly afford a most charming Prospect especially by this Light For the solemn Gloom which the Moon casts on all Objects is beyond Expression beautiful especially to an Imagination which is desirous of cultivating melancholy Ideas'  Very probably' answered  Partridge  'but if the Top of the Hill be properest to produce melancholy Thoughts I suppose the Bottom is the likeliest to produce merry ones and these I take to be much the better of the two I protest you have made my Blood run cold with the very mentioning the Top of that Mountain which seems to me to be one of the highest in the World No  no if we look for any thing let it be for a Place under Ground to screen ourselves from the Frost    Do so said  Jones  let it be but within Hearing of this Place and I will hollow to you at my Return back'  'Surely Sir you are not mad'  said  Partridge  'Indeed I am' answered  Jones  'if ascending this Hill be Madness But as you complain so much of the cold already I would have you stay below I will certainly return to you within an Hour'  Pardon me Sir' cries  Partridge  I have determined to follow you whereever you go'  Indeed he was now afraid to stay behind for tho' he was Coward enough in all Respects yet his chief Fear was that of Ghosts with which the present Time of Night and the Wildness of the Place extremely well suited  At this Instant  Partridge  espied a glimmering Light through some Trees which seemed very near to them He immediately cried out in a Rapture  'Oh Sir Heaven hath at last heard my Prayers and hath brought us to a House perhaps it may be an Inn Let me beseech you Sir if you have any Compassion either for me or yourself do not despise the the Goodness of Providence but let us go directly to yon Light Whether it be a Publickhouse or no I am sure if they be Christians that dwell there they will not refuse a little Houseroom to Persons in our miserable Condition'  Jones  at length yielded to the earnest Supplications of  Partridge  and both together made directly towards the Place whence the Light issued  They soon arrived at the Door of this House or Cottage For it might be called either without much Impropriety Here  Jones  knocked several Times withreceiving any Answer from within at which  Partridge  whose head was full of nothing but of Ghosts Devils Witches and such like began to tremble crying  'Lord have Mercy upon us sure the People  must be all dead I can see no Light neither now and yet I am certain I saw a Candle burning but a Moment beforeWell I have heard of such Things  What hast thou heard of' said  Jones  The People are either fast asleep or probably as this is a lonely Place are afraid to open their Door'  He then began to vociferate pretty loudly and at last an old Woman opening an upper Casement asked who they were and what they wanted  Jones  answered  'they were Travellers who had lost their Way and having seen a Light in the Window had been led thither in Hopes of finding some Fire to warm themselves'  Whoever you are' cries the Woman 'you have no Business here nor shall I open the Door to any body a this Time of Night'  Partridge  whom the Sound of a human Voice had recovered from his Fright fell to the most earnest Supplications to be admitted for a few Minutes to the Fire saying  'he was almost dead with the Cold'  to which Fear had indeed contributed equally with the Frost He assured her that the Gentleman who spoke to her was one of the greatest Squires in the Country and made use of every Argument save one which  Jones  afterwards effectually added and this was the Promise of half a Crown A Bribe too great to be resisted by such a Person especially as the genteel Appearance of  Jones  which the Light of the Moon plainly discovered to her together with his affable Behaviour had entirely subdued those Apprehensions of Thieves which she had at first conceived She agreed therefore at last to let them in where  Partridge  to his infinite Joy found a good Fire ready for his Reception  The poor Fellow however had no sooner warmed himself than those Thoughts which were always uppermost in his Mind began a little to disturb his Brain There was no Article of his Creed in which he had a stronger Faith than he had in Witchcraft  nor can the Reader conceive a Figure more adapted to inspire this Idea than the old Woman who now stood before him She answered exactly to that Picture drawn by  Otway  in his Orphan Indeed if this Woman had lived in the Reign of  James  the First her Appearance alone would have hanged her almost without any Evidence  Many Circumstances likewise conspired to confirm  Partridge  in his Opinion Her living as he then imagined by herself in so lonely a Place and in a House the Outside of which seemed much too good for her but where the Inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant Manner To say the Truth  Jones  himself was not a little surprized at what he saw For besides the extraordinary Neatness of the Room it was adorned with a great Number of Nicknacks and Curiosities which might have engaged the Attention of a Virtuoso  While  Jones  was admiring these Things and  Partridge  sat trembling with the firm Belief that he was in the House of a Witch the old Woman said  'I hope Gentlemen you will make what Haste you can for I expect my Master presently and I would not for double the Money he should find you here'  'Then you have a Master' cries  Jones  indeed you will excuse me good Woman but I was surprized to see all those fine Things in your House'  'Ah Sir' said she 'if the twentieth Part of these Things were mine I should think myself a rich Woman but pray Sir do not stay much longer For I look for him in every Minute'    'Why sure he would not be angry with you' said  Jones  'for doing a common Act of Charity  Alackaday Sir' said she 'he is a strange Man not at all like other People He keeps no Company with any Body and seldom walks out but by Night for he doth not care to be seen and all the Country People  are as much afraid of meeting him for his Dress is enough to frighten those who are not used to it They call him  The Man of the Hill  for there he walks by Night and the Country People are not I believe more afraid of the Devil himself He would be terribly angry if he found you here'  'Pray Sir' says  Partridge  'don't let us offend the Gentleman I am ready to walk and was never warmer in my LifeDo pray Sir let us gohere are Pistols over the Chimney who knows whether they be charged or no or what he may do with them'  'Fear nothing  Partridge'  cries  Jones  'I will secure thee from Danger'    'Nay for Matter o' that he never doth any Mischief' said the Woman 'but to be sure it is necessary he should keep some Arms for his own Safety for his House hath been beset more than once and it is not many Nights ago that we thought we heard Thieves about it for my own Part I have often wondered that he is not murdered by some Villain or other as he walks out by himself at such Hours but then as I said the People are afraid of him and besides they think I suppose he hath nothing about him worth taking'  'I should imagine by this Collection of Rarities' cries  Jones  that your Master had been a Traveller'  'Yes Sir' answered she 'he hath been a very great one there be few Gentlemen that know more of all Matters than he I fancy he hath been crost in Love or whatever it is I know not but I have lived with him above these thirty Years and in all that Time he hath hardly spoke to six living People'  She then again solicited their Departure in which she was backed by  Partridge  but  Jones  purposely protracted the time For his Curiosity was greatly raised to see this extraordinary Person Tho' the old Woman therefore concluded every one of her Answers with desiring him to be gone and  Partridge  proceed  so far as to pull him by the Sleeve he still continued to invent new Questions till the old Woman with an affrighted Countenance declared she heard her Master's Signal and at the same Instant more than one Voice was heard without the Door  rying 'Dn your Blood shew us your Money this Instant Your Money you Villain or we will blow your Brains about your Ears  'O good Heaven' cries the old Woman 'Some Villains to be sure have attacked my Master O la what shall I do what shall I do'  'How cries  Jones  howAre these Pistols loaded'  'O Good Sir there is nothing in them indeedO pray don't murder us Gentlemen'  for in reality she now had the same Opinion of those within as she had for those without  Jones  made her no Answer but snatching an old Broadsword which hung  n the Room he instantly sallied out where he found the old Gentleman struggling with two Ruffians and begging for Mercy  Jones  asked no Questions but  ell so briskly to work with his Broadsword that the Fellows immediately quitted their Hold and without offering to attack our Hero betook themselves to their Heels and made their Escape for he did not attempt to pursue them being contented with having delivered the old Gentleman and indeed he concluded he had pretty well done their Business For both of them as they ran off cried out with bitter Oaths that they were dead Men  Jones  presently ran to lift up the old Gentleman who had been thrown down in the Scuffle expressed  t the same Time great Concern lest he should have  eceived any Harm from the Villians The old Man  ared a Moment at  Jones  and then cried  'No Sir no I have very little Harm I thank you Lord have mercy upon me'  'I see Sir' said  ones  'you are not free from Apprehensions even of those who have had the Happiness to be your  Deliverers nor can I blame any Suspicions which you may have but indeed you have no real Occasion for any here are none but your Friends present Having mist our Way this cold Night we took the Liberty of warming ourselves at your Fire whence we were just departing when we heard you call for Assistance which I must say Providence alone seems to have sent you'    'Providence indeed' cries the old Gentleman 'if it be so'    'So it is I assure you' cries  Jones  'here is your own Sword Sir I have used it in your Defence and I now return it into your own Hand'  The old Man having received the Sword which was stained with the Blood of his Enemies looked stedfastly at  Jones  during some Moments and then with a Sigh cried out  'You will pardon me young Gentleman I was not always of a suspicious Temper nor am I a Friend to Ingratitude'  'Be thankful then' cries  Jones  'to that Providence to which you owe your Deliverance as to my Part I have only discharged the common Duties of Humanity and what I would have done for any Fellow Creature in your Situation'  Let me look at you a little longer' cries the old Gentleman'You are a human Creature then'Well perhaps you are Come pray walk into my little Hutt You have been my' Deliverer indeed  The old Woman was distracted between the Fears which she had of her Master and for him and  Partridge  was if possible in a greater Fright The former of these however when she heard her Master speak kindly to  Jones  and perceived what had happened came again to herself but  Partridge  no sooner saw the Gentleman than the Strangeness of his Dress infused greater Terrors into that poor Fellow than he had before felt either from the strange Description which he had heard or from the Uproar which had happened at the Door  To say the Truth it was an Appearance which might have affected a more constant Mind than that of Mr  Partridge  This Person was of the tallest  ize with a long Beard as white as Snow His Bo  y was cloathed with the Skin of an Ass made something into the Form of a Coat He wore likewise Boots on his Legs and a Cap on his Head both composed of the Skin of some other Animals  As soon as the old Gentleman came into his House  he old Woman began her Congratulations on his hap  y Escape from the Ruffins  'Yes' cries he 'I have escaped indeed Thanks to my Preserver'  O the Blessing on him' answered she 'he is a good Gentleman I warrant him I was afraid your Worship would have been angry with me for letting him in and to be certain I should not have done it had not I seen by the Moonlight that he was a Gentleman and almost frozen to Death And to be certain it must have been some good Angel that sent him hither and tempted me to do it  'I am afraid Sir' said the old Gentleman to  ones  'that I have nothing in this House which you can either eat or drink unless you will accept a Dram of Brandy of which I can give you some most excellent and which I have had by me these thirty Years'  Jones  declined this Offer in a very  ivil and proper Speech and then the other asked him  'Whither he was travelling when he mist his Way saying I must own myself surprized to see such a Person as you appear to be journeying on Foot at this Time of Night I suppose Sir you are a Gentleman of these Parts for you do not look like one who is used to travel far without Horses  'Appearances' cried  Jones  'are often deceitful Men sometimes look like what they are not I assure you I am not of this Country and whither I am traveling in reality I scarce know myself  'Whoever you are or whithersoever you are going answered the old Man I have Obligations to' you which I can never return  'I once more' replied  Jones  'affirm that you have none For there can be no Merit in having hazarded that in your Service on which I set no Value And nothing is so contemptible in my Eye  ' as Life  'I am sorry young Gentleman' answered th  Stranger 'that you have any Reason to be so unhappy' at your Years  'Indeed I am Sir' answered  Jones  'the mo  unhappy of Mankind'    'Perhaps you have ha  a Friend or a Mistress'  replied the other  'Ho  could you' cries  Jones  'mention two Words suf+ficient to drive me to Distraction'  'Either of ther  are enough to drive any Man to Distraction'  an+swered the old Man  'I enquire no farther Sir Perhaps my Curiosity hath led me too far already'  'Indeed Sir cries  Jones  'I cannot censure Passion which I feel at this Instant in the highe  Degree You will pardon me when I assure you that every Thing which I have seen or heard sin  I first entered this House hath conspired to raise th  greatest Curiosity in me Something very extra+ordinary must have determined you to this Cour  of Life and I have reason to fear your own His+tory' is not without Misfortunes'  Here the old Gentleman again sighed and remain+ed silent for some Minutes at last looking earnest on  Jones  he said  'I have read that a good Count  +nance is a Letter of recommendation if so no  ever can be more strongly recommended than your self If I did not feel some Yearnings towar  you from another Consideration I must be the mo  ungrateful Monster upon Earth and I am real  concerned it is no otherwise in my Power than' Words to convince you of my Gratitude'  Jones  after a Moment's Hesitation answered  'That it was in his Power by Words to gratify him extremely I have confest a Curiosity said he Sir need I say how much obliged I should be to you if you would condescend to gratify it Will you suffer me therefore to beg unless any Consideration restrains you that you would be pleased to acquaint me what Motives have induced you thus to withdraw from the Society of Mankind and to betake yourself to a Course of Life to which it sufficiently' appears you was not born  'I scarce think myself at Liberty to refuse you any thing after what hath happened'  replied the old Man  'If you desire therefore to hear the Story of an unhappy Man I will relate it to you Indeed you judge rightly in thinking there is commonly something extraordinary in the Fortunes of those who fly from Society For however it may seem a Paradox or even a Contradiction certain it is that great Philanthropy chiefly inclines us to avoid and detest Mankind not on Account so much of their private and selfish Vices but for those of a relative Kind such as Envy Malice Treachery Cruelty with every other Species of Malevolence These are the Vices which true Philanthropy abhors and which rather than see and converse with she avoids Society itself However without a Compliment to you you do not appear to me one of those whom I should shun or detest nay I must say in what little hath dropt from you there appears some Parity in our Fortunes I hope however yours will conclude more successfully'  Here some Compliments passed between our Heroe and his Host and then the latter was going to begin his History when  Partridge  interrupted him His Apprehensions had now pretty well left him but some Effects of his Terrors remained he therefore reminded the Gentleman of that excellent Brandy  which he had mentioned This was presently brought and  Partridge  swallowed a large Bumper  The Gentleman then without any farther Preface began as you may read in the next Chapter  CHAP XI  In which the Man of the Hill begins to relate his History  'I Was born in a Village of  Somersetshire  called  Mark  in the Year my Father was one of those whom they call Gentlemen Farmers He had a little Estate of about  l  a Year of his own and rented another Estate of near the same Value He was prudent and industrious and so good a Husbandman that he might have led a very easy and comfortable Life had not an errant Vixe  of a Wife soured his domestic Quiet But tho this Circumstance perhaps made him miserable i  did not make him poor For he confined her almost entirely at Home and rather chose to bear eeternal Upbraidings in his own House than to injur  his Fortune by indulging her in the Extravagancie  ' she desired abroad  'By this  Xantippe  so was the Wife of  Socrate  called said  Partridge  'By this  Xantippe  he had two Sons of which I was the younger He designe  to give us both good Educations but my elde  Brother who unhappily for him was the Favourit  of my Mother utterly neglected his Learning insomuch that after having been five or six Years a  School with little or no Improvement my Father being told by his Master that it would be to n  Purpose to keep him longer there at last complie  with my Mother in taking him home from the Hand of that Tyrant as she called his Master thoug  indeed he gave the Lad much less Correction tha  his Idleness deserved but much more it seem  than the young Gentleman liked who constantly complained to his Mother of his severe Treatment' and she as constantly gave him a Hearing  "Yes yes' cries  Partridge  'I have seen such Mothers I have been abused myself by them and very unjustly such Parents deserve Correction' as much as their Children  Jones  chid the Pedagogue for this Interruption  nd then the Stranger proceeded 'My Brother now at the Age of fifteen bid adieu to all Learning and to every Thing else but to his Dog and Gun with which latter he became so expert that though perhaps you may think it incredible he could not only hit a standing Mark with great Certainty but hath actually shot a Crow as it was flying in the Air He was likewise excellent at finding a Hare sitting and was soon reputed one of the best Sportsmen in the Country A Reputation which both he and his Mother enjoyed as much as if he had been thought the finest Scholar  'The Situation of my Brother made me at first think my Lot the harder in being continued at School but I soon changed my Opinion for as I advanced pretty fast in Learning my Labours became easy and my Exercise so delightful that Holidays were my most unpleasant Time For my Mother who never loved me now apprehending that I had the greater Share of my Father's Affection and finding or at least thinking that I was more taken Notice of by some Gentlemen of Learning and particularly by the Parson of the Parish than my Brother she now hated my Sight and made Home so disagreeable to me that what is called by Schoolboys Black Monday was to me the whitest in the whole Year  'Having at length gone through the School at  Taunton  I was thence removed to  Exeter  College in  Oxford  where I remained four Years at the  End of which an Accident happened that put a final End to my Studies and whence I may truly date the Rise of all which happened to me afterwards in Life'  'There was at the same College with myself one Sir  George Gresham  a young Fellow who was intitled to a very considerable Fortune which he was not by the Will of his Father to come into full Possession of till he arrived at the Age of Twentyfive However the Liberality of his Guardians gave him litle Cause to regret the abundant Caution of his Father for they allowed him Five hundred Pound a Year while he remained at the University where he kept his Horses and his Whore and lived as wicked and as profligate a Life as he could have done had he been never so entirely Master of his Fortune for besides the Five hundred a Year which he received from his Guardians he found Means to spend a thousand more He was above the Age of Twentyone and had no Difficulty of gaining what Credit he pleased'  'This young Fellow among many other tolerable bad Qualities had one very diabolical He had a great Delight in destroying and ruining the Youth of inferior Fortune by drawing them into Expences which they could not afford so well as himself and the better and worthier and soberer any young Man was the greater Pleasure and Triumph had he in his Destruction Thus acting the Character which is recorded of the Devil and going about seeking whom he might devour'  'It was my Misfortune to fall into an Acquaintance and Intimacy with this Gentleman My Reputation of Diligence in my Studies made me a desirable Object of his mischievous Intention and my own Inclination made it sufficiently easy for him to effect his Purpose for tho' I had applied myself with much Industry to Books in which I took  great Delight there were other Pleasures in which I was capable of taking much greater for I was highmettled had a violent Flow of animal Spirits was a little ambitious and extremely amorous'  'I had not long contracted an Intimacy with Sir  George  before I became a Partaker of all his Pleasures and when I was once entered on that Scene neither my Inclination nor my Spirit would suffer me to play an UnderPart I was second to none of the Company in any Acts of Debauchery nay I soon distinguished myself so notably in all Riots and Disorders that my Name generally stood first in the Roll of Delinquents and instead of being lamented as the unfortunate Pupil of Sir  George  I was now accused as the Person who had misled and debauched that hopeful young Gentleman for tho' he was the Ringleader and Promoter of all the Mischief he was never so considered I fell at last under the Censure of the ViceChancellor and very narrowly escaped Expulsion  'You will easily believe Sir that such a Life as I am now describing must be incompatible with my further Progress in Learning and that in Proportion as I addicted myself more and more to loose Pleasure I must grow more and more remiss in Application to my Studies This was truly the Consequence but this was not all My Expences now greatly exceeded not only my former Income but those Additions which I extorted from my poor generous Father by Pretences of Sums necessary for preparing for my approaching Degree of Batchelor of Arts These Demands however grew at last so frequent and exorbitant that my Father by slow Degrees opened his Ears to the Accounts which he received from many Quarters of my present Behaviour and which my Mother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly adding 'Ay  this is the fine Gentleman the Scholar who doth so much Honour to his Family and is to be the making of it I thought what all his Learning would come to He is to be the Ruin of us all I find after his elder Brother hath been denied Necessaries for his Sake to perfect his Education forsooth for which he was to pay us such Interest I thought what the Interest would come to" with much more of the same Kind but I have I believe satisfied you with this Taste'  'My Father therefore began now to return Remonstrances instead of Money to my Demands which brought my Affairs perhaps a little sooner to a Crisis but had he remitted me his whole Income you will imagine it could have sufficed a very short Time to support one who kept Pace with the Expences of Sir  George Gresham  'It is more than possible that the Distress I was now in for Money and the Impracticability of going on in this Manner might have restored me at once to my Senses and to my Studies had I opened my Eyes before I became involved in Debts from which I saw no Hopes of ever extricating myself This was indeed the great Art of Sir  George  and by which he accomplished the Ruin of many whom he afterwards laughed at as Fools and Coxcombs for vying as he called it with a Man of his Fortune To bring this about he would now and then advance a little Money himself in order to support the Credit of the unfortunate Youth with other People till by Means of that very Credit he was irretrievably undone'  'My Mind being by these Means grown as desperate as my Fortune there was scarce a Wickedness which I did not meditate in order for my Relief Selfmurder itself became the Subject of my serious Deliberation and I had certainly resolved on it had not a more shameful tho' perhaps  less sinful Thought expelled it from my Head'  Here he hesitated a Moment and then cried out 'I protest so many Years have not washed away the Shame of this Act and I shall blush while I relate it  'Jones  desired him to pass over any thing that might give him pain in the Relation' but  Partridge  eagerly cried out 'O pray Sir let us hear this I had rather hear this than all the rest as I hoped to be saved I will never mention a Word of it'  Jones  was going to rebuke him but the Stranger prevented it by proceeding thus  'I had a Chum a very prudent frugal young Lad who tho' he had no very large Allowance had by his Parsimony heaped up upwards of forty Guineas which I knew he kept in his Escritore I took therefore an Opportunity of purloining his Key from his Breeches Pocket while he was asleep and thus made myself Master of all his Riches After which I again conveyed his Key into his Pocket and counterfeiting Sleep tho' I never once closed my Eyes lay in Bed till after he arose and went to Prayers an Exercise to which I had long been unaccustomed'  'Timorous Thieves by extreme Caution often subject themselves to Discoveries which those of a bolder Kind escape Thus it happened to me for had I boldly broke open his Escritore I had perhaps escaped even his Suspicion but as it was plain that the Person who robbed him had possessed himself of his Key he had no Doubt when he first missed his Money but that his Chum was certainly the Thief Now as he was of a fearful Disposition and much my Inferior in Strength and I believe in Courage he did not dare to confront me with my Guilt for fear of worse bodily Consequences which might happen to him He repaired therefore immediately to the ViceChancellor  and upon swearing to the Robbery and to the Circumstances of it very easily obtained a Warrant against one who had now so bad a Character through the whole University'  'Luckily for me I lay out of the College the next Evening for that Day I attended a young Lady in a Chaise to  Whitney  where we staid all Night and in our Return the next Morning to  Oxford  I met one of my Cronies who acquainted me with sufficient News concerning myself to make me turn my Horse another Way'  'Pray Sir did he mention any thing of the Warrant' said  Partridge  But  Jones  begged the Gentleman to proceed without regarding any impertinent' Questions which he did as follows  'Having now abandoned all Thoughts of returning to  Oxford  the next Thing which offered itself was a Journey to  London  I imparted this Intention to my female Companion who at first remonstrated against it but upon producing my Wealth she immediately consented We then struck across the Country into the great  Cirencester  Road and made such Haste that we spent the next Evening save one in  London  '  'When you consider the Place where I now was and the Company with whom I was you will I fancy conceive that a very short Time brought me to an End of that Sum of which I had so iniquitously' possessed myself  'I was now reduced to a much higher Degree of Distress than before the Necessaries of Life began to be numbered among my Wants and what made my Case still the more grievous was that my Paramour of whom I was now grown immoderately fond shared the same Distresses with myself To see a Woman you love in Distress to be unable to relieve her and at the same Time to reflect that you have brought her into this Situation is perhaps  Curse of which no Imagination can represent the Horrors to those who have not felt it'  I believe it from my Soul' cries  Jones  'and I pity you from the Bottom of my Heart'  He then took two or three disorderly Turns about the Room and at last begged Pardon and flung himself into his Chair crying  'I thank Heaven I have escaped that'  'This Circumstance' continued the Gentleman 'so severely aggravated the Horrors of my present Situation that they became absolutely intolerable I could with less Pain endure the raging of my own natural unsatisfied Appetites even Hunger or Thirst than I could submit to leave ungratified the most whimsical Desires of a Woman on whom I so extravagantly doated that tho' I knew she had been the Mistress of half my Acquaintance I firmly intended to marry her But the good Creature was unwilling to consent to an Action which the World might think so much to my Disadvantage And as possibly she compassionated the daily Anxieties which she must have perceived me suffer on her Account she resolved to put an End to my Distress She soon indeed found Means to relieve me from my troublesome and perplexed Situation For while I was distracted with various Inventions to supply her with Pleasures she very kindlybetrayed me to one of her former Lovers at  Oxford  by whose Care and Diligence I was immediately apprehended and committed to Goal'  'Here I first began seriously to reflect on the Miscarriages of my former Life on the Errors I had been guilty of on the Misfortunes which I had brought on myself and on the Grief which I must have occasioned to one of the best of Fathers When I added to all these the Perfidy of my Mistress such was the Horror of my Mind that Life  instead of being longer desirable grew the Object of my Abhorrence and I could have gladly embraced Death as my dearest Friend if it had offered itself to my Choice unattended by Shame'  'The Time of the Assizes soon came and I was removed by  Habeas Corpus  to  Oxford  where I expected certain Conviction and Condemnation but to my great Surprize none appeared against me and I was at the End of the Sessions discharged for Want of Prosecution In short my Chum had left  Oxford  and whether from Indolence or from what other Motive I am ignorant had declined concerning himself any farther in the Affair'  'Perhaps' cries  Partridge  'he did not care to have your Blood upon his Hands and he was in the right on't If any Person was to be hanged upon my Evidence I should never be able to lie alone afterwards for Fear of seeing his Ghost'  'I shall shortly doubt  Partridge'  says  Jones  'whether thou art more brave or wise  'You may laugh at me Sir if you please' answered  Partridge  'but if you will hear a very short Story which I can tell and which is most certainly true perhaps you may change your Opinion In the Parish where I was born  Here  Jones  would have silenced him but the Stranger interceded that he might be permitted to tell his Story and in the mean time promised to recollect the Remainder of his own  Partridge  then proceeded thus  'In the Parish where I was born there lived a Farmer whose Name was  Bridle  and he had a Son named  Francis  a good hopeful young Fellow I was at the Gram+mar School with him where I remember he wa  got into  Ovid  's  Epistles  and he could construe yo  three Lines together sometimes without looking into a Dictionary Besides all this he was a very goo  Lad never missed Church o' Sundays and was rec+  koned one of the best PsalmSingers in the whole Parish He would indeed now and then take a Cup too much and that was the only Fault he had'    Well but come to the Ghost'  cries  Jones  'Never fear Sir I shall come to him soon enough' answered  Partridge  'You must know then that Farmer  Bridle  lost a Mare a sorrel one to the best of my Remembrance and so it fell out that this young  Francis  shortly afterward being at a Fair at  Hindon  and as I think it was onI can't remember the Day and being as he was what should he happen to meet but a Man upon his Father's Mare  Frank  called out presently Stop Thief and it being in the Middle of the Fair it was impossible you know for the Man to make his Escape So they apprehended him and carried him before the Justice I remember it was Justice  Willoughby  of  Noyle  a very worthy good Gentleman and he committed him to Prison and bound  Frank  in a Recognizance I think they call it a hard Word compounded of  re  and  cognosco  but it differs in its Meaning from the Use of the Simple as many other Compounds do Well at last down came my Lord Justice  Page  to hold the Assizes and so the Fellow was had up and  Frank  was had up for a Witness To be sure I shall never forget the Face of the Judge when he begun to ask him what he had to say against the Prisoner He made poor  Frank  tremble and shake in his Shoes Well you Fellow says my Lord what have you to say Don't stand humming and hawing but speak out but however he soon turned altogether as civil to  Frank  and began to thunder at the Fellow and when he asked him if he had any Thing to say for himself the Fellow said he had found the Horse Ay' answered the Judge 'thou art a lucky Fellow I have travelled the Circuit these forty Years  and never found a Horse in my Life but I'll tell thee what Friend thou wast more lucky than thou didst know of For thou didst not only find a Horse but a Halter too I promise thee To be sure I shall never forget the Word Upon which every Body fell a laughing as how could they help it Nay and twenty other Jests he made which I can't remember now There was something about his Skill in Horse Flesh which made all the Folks laugh To be certain the Judge must have been a very brave Man as well as a Man of much Learning It is indeed charming Sport to hear Trials upon Life and Death One Thing I own I thought a little hard that the Prisoner's Counsel was not suffered to speak for him though he desired only to be heard one very short Word but my Lord would not hearken to him though he suffered a Counsellor to talk against him for above half an Hour I thought it hard I own that there should be so many of them my Lord and the Court and the Jury and the Counsellors and the Witnesse  all upon one poor Man and he too in Chains▪ Well the Fellow was hanged as to be sure it cou'd be no otherwise and poor  Frank  could never be easy about it He never was in the dark alone bu  he fancied he saw the Fellow's Spirit  Well and is this thy Story cries  Jones  No no answer'd  Partridge  'O Lord have Mercy upon meI am just now coming to the Matter for one Night coming from the Alehouse in a long narrow dar  Lane there he ran directly up against him and th  Spirit was all in white and fell upon  Frank  and  Frank  who is a sturdy Lad fell upon the Spirit again and there they had a Tussel together an  poor  Frank  was dreadfully beat indeed he made  shift at last to crawl Home but what with the beating and what with the Fright he lay ill above  Fortnight and all this is most certainly true and the whole Parish will bear Witness to it'  The Stranger smiled at this Story and  Jones  burst into a loud Fit of Laughter upon which  Partridge  cried  'Ay you may laugh Sir and so did some others particularly a Squire who is thought to be no better than an Atheist who forsooth because there was a Calf with a white Face found dead in the same Lane the next Morning would fain have it that the Battle was between  Frank  and that as if a Calf would set upon a Man Besides  Frank  told me he knew it to be a Spirit and could swear to him in any Court in Christendom and he had not drank above a Quart or two or such a Matter of Liquor at the time Lud have Mercy upon us and keep us all from dipping our Hands in Blood I say'  'Well Sir' said  Jones  to the Stranger 'Mr  Partridge  hath finished his Story and I hope will give you no future Interruption if you will be so kind to proceed He then resumed his Narration but as he hath taken Breath for a while we think proper to give it to our Reader and shall therefore put an End to this Chapter'  CHAP XII  In which the Man of the Hill continues his History  'I Had now regained my Liberty said the Stranger but I had lost my Reputation for there is a wide Difference between the Case of a Man who is barely acquitted of a Crime in a Court of Justice and of him who is acquitted in his own Heart and in the Opinion of the People I was conscious of my Guilt and ashamed to look any one in the Face so resolved to leave  Oxford  the next Morning  before the Daylight discovered me to the Eyes of any Beholders'  'When I had got clear of the City it first entered into my Head to return Home to my Father and endeavour to obtain his Forgiveness but as I had no Reason to doubt his Knowledge of all which had past and as I was well assured of his great Aversion to all Acts of Dishonesty I could entertain no Hopes of being received by him especially since I was too certain of all the good Offices in the Power of my Mother Nay had my Father's Pardon been as sure as I conceived his Resentment to be I yet question whether I could have had the Assurance to behold him or whether I could upon any Terms have submitted to live and converse with those who I was convinced knew me to have been guilty of so base an Action'  'I hastened therefore back to  London  the best Retirement of either Grief or Shame unless for Persons of a very publick Character for here you have the Advantage of Solitude without its Disadvantage since you may be alone and in Company at the same Time and while you walk or sit unobserved Noise Hurry and a constant Succession of Objects entertain the Mind and prevent the Spirits from preying on themselves or rather on Grief or Shame which are the most unwholesome Diet in the World and on which though there are many who never taste either but in public there are some who can feed very plentifully and very fatally when alone'  'But as there is scarce any human Good without its concommitant Evil so there are People who find an Inconvenience in this unobserving Temper of Mankind I mean Persons who have no Money for as you are not put out of Countenance so neither are you cloathed or fed by those who do  not know you And a Man may be as easily starved in  Leadenhall  Market as in the Desarts of  Arabia  '  'It was at present my Fortune to be destitute of that great Evil as it is apprehended to be by several Writers who I suppose were over burthened with it namely Money' "With Submission Sir said  Partridge  I do not remember any Writers who have called it  Malorum  but  Irritamenta Malorum Effodiuntur opes irritamenta Malorum"  Well Sir continued the Stranger whether it be an Evil or only the Cause of Evil I was entirely void of it and at the same Time of Friends and as I thought of Acquaintance when one Evening as I was passing through the  Inner Temple  very hungry and very miserable I heard a Voice on a suden haling me with great Familiarity by my Christian Name and upon my turning about I presently recollected the Person who so saluted me to have been my Fellow Collegiate one who had left the University above a Year and long before any of my Misfortunes had befallen me This Gentleman whose Name was  Watson  shook me heartily by the Hand and expressing great Joy at meeting me proposed our immediately drinking a Bottle together I first declined the Proposal and pretended Business but as he was very earnest and pressing Hunger at last overcame my Pride and I fairly confessed to him I had no Money in my Pocket yet not without framing a Lie for an Excuse and imputing it to my having changed my Breeches that Morning Mr  Watson  answered I thought  Jack  you and I had been too old Acquaintance for you to mention such a Matter He then took me by the Arm and was pulling me along but I gave him very little Trouble for  my own Inclinations pulled me much stronger than he could do'  'We then went into the Friers which you know is the Scene of all Mirth and Jollity Here when we arrived at the Tavern Mr  Watson  applied himself to the Drawer only without taking the least Notice of the Cook for he had no Suspicion but that I had dined long since However as the Case was really otherwise I forged another Falshood and told my Companion I had been at the further End of the City on Business of Consequence and had snapt up a Mutton Chop in Haste so that I was again Hungry and wished he would add a Beef Steak to his Bottle'  'Some People cries  Partridge  'ought to have good Memories or did you find just Money enough in your Breeches to pay for the Mutton Chop'  'Your Observation is right' answered the Stranger 'and I believe such Blunders are inseparable from all dealing in UntruthBut to proceedI began now to feel myself extremely happy The Meat and Wine soon revived my Spirits to a high Pitch and I enjoyed much Pleasure in the Conversation of my old Acquaintance the rather as I thought him entirely ignorant of what had happened at the University since his leaving' it  'But he did not suffer me to remain long in this agreeable Delusion for taking a Bumper in one Hand and holding me by the other "Here my Boy" cries he "here's wishing you Joy of your being so honourably acquitted of that Affair laid to your Charge" 'I was Thunderstruck with Confusion at these Words which  Watson  observing proceeded thusNay never be ashamed Man thou hast been acquitted and no one now dares call thee guilty but prithee do tell me who am thy Friend I hope thou didst really rob him for  rat me if it was not a meritorious Action to strip such a sneaking pitiful Rascal and instead of the two hundred Guineas I wish you had taken as many thousand Come come my Boy don't be shy of confessing to me you are not now brought before one of the Pimps Dn me if I don't honour you for it for as I hope for Salvation I would have made no manner of Scruple of doing the same Thing'  'This Declaration a little relieved my Abashment and as Wine had now somewhat opened my Heart I very freely acknowledged the Robbery but acquainted him that he had been misinformed as to the Sum taken which was little more than a fifth Part of what he had mentioned'  'I am sorry for it with all my Heart quoth he and I wish thee better Success another Time Tho' if you will take my Advice you shall have no Occasion' to run any such Risque  Here said he taking some Dice out of his Pocket 'here's the Stuff Here are the Implements here are the little Doctors which cure the Distempers of the Purse Follow but my Counsel and I will shew you a Way to empty the Pockets of a  Queer Cull  without any Danger of the  Nubbing Cheat'  'Nubbing Cheat'  cries  Partridge  'Pay Sir what is that'  'Why that Sir' says the Stranger 'is a Cant Phrase for the Gallows for as Gamesters differ little from Highwaymen in their Morals so do they' very much resemble them in their Language  'We had now each drank our Bottle when Mr  Watson  said the Board was sitting and that he must attend earnestly pressing me at the same Time to go with him and try my Fortune I answered He knew that was at present out of my Power as I had informed him of the emptiness of  my Pocket To say the Truth I doubted not from his many strong Expressions of Friendship but that he would offer to lend me a small Sum for that Purpose but he answered "Never mind' that Man e'en boldly run a Levant  Partridge  was going to enquire the Meaning of that Word but  Jones  stopped his Mouth  'but be circumspect as to the Man I will tip you the proper Person which may be necessary as you do not know the Town nor can distinguish a Rum Cull from a Queer one'  'The Bill was now brought when  Watson  paid his Share and was departing I reminded him not without blushing of my having no Money'  He answered 'That signifies nothing score it behind the Door or make a bold Brush and take no NoticeOrstay" says he "I will go down Stairs first and then do you take up my Money and score the whole Reckoning at the Bar and I will wait for you at the Corner" 'I expressed some Dislike at this and hinted my Expectations that he would have deposited the whole but he swore he had not another Sixpence in his Pocket'  'He then went down and I was prevailed on to take up the Money and follow him which I did close enough to hear him tell the Drawer the Reckoning was upon the Table The Drawer passed by me up Stairs but I made such Haste into the Street that I heard nothing of his Disappointment nor did I mention a Syllable at the Bar according to my Instructions'  'We now went directly to the Gaming Table where Mr  Watson  to my Surprize pulled out a large Sum of Money and placed before him as did many others all of them no doubt considering their own Heaps as so many decoy Birds  which were to entice and draw over the Heaps of' their Neighbours  'Here it would be tedious to relate all the Freaks which Fortune or rather the Dice played in this her Temple Mountains of Gold were in a few Moments reduced to nothing at one Part of the Table and rose as suddenly in another The rich grew in a Moment poor and the Poor as suddenly became rich so that it seemed a Philosopher could no where have so well instructed his Pupils in the Contempt of Riches at least he could no where have better inculcated the Incertainty of their Duration'  'For my own Part after having considerably improved my small Estate I at last entirely demolished it Mr  Watson  too after much Variety of Luck rose from the Table in some Heat and declared he had lost a cool hundred and would play no longer Then coming up to me he asked me to return with him to the Tavern but I positively refused saying I would not bring myself a second Time into such a Dilemma and especially as he had lost all his Money and was now in my own Condition' Pooh" says he "I have just borrowed a couple of Guineas of a Friend and one of them is at your Service" 'He immediately put one of them into my Hand and I no longer resisted his Inclination'  'I was at first a little shocked at returning to the same House whence we had departed in so unhandsome a Manner but when the Drawer with very civil Address told us "he believed we had forgot to pay our Reckoning" I became perfectly easy and very readily gave him a Guinea bid him pay himself and acquiesced in the unjust Charge which had been laid on my Memory'  'Mr  Watson  now bespoke the most extravagant Supper he could well think of and tho' he had contented  himself with simple Claret before nothing but the most precious Burgundy would serve his Purpose'  'Our Company was soon encreased by the Addition of several Gentlemen from the GamingTable most of whom as I afterwards found came not to the Tavern to drink but in the Way of Business for the true Gamesters pretended to be ill and refused their Glass while they plied heartily two young Fellows who were to be afterwards pillaged as indeed they were without Mercy Of this Plunder I had the good Fortune to be a Sharer tho I was not yet let into the Secret'  'There was one remarkable Accident attended this Tavern Play for the Money by Degrees totally disappeared so that tho' at the Beginning the Table was half covered with Gold yet before the Play ended which it did not till the next Day being  Sunday  at Noon there was scarce a Guine  to be seen on the Table and this was the stranger as every Person present except myself declared h  had lost and what was become of the Money unless the Devil himself carried it away is diffi+cult to determine'  'Most certainly he did' says  Partridge  'for evi  Spirits can carry away any Thing without being seen tho' there were never so many Folk in th  Room and I should not have been surprized if h  had carried away all the Company of a Set of wick+ed Wretches who were at play in Sermontime And I could tell you a true Story if I would where the Devil took a man out of Bed from ano+ther Man's Wife and carried him away through th  Keyhole of the Door I've seen the very House where it was done and no Body hath lived in i  these thirty Years'  Tho'  Jones  was a little offended by the Impertinence of  Partridge  he could not however avoi  smiling at his Simplicity The Stranger did the same and then proceeded with his Story as will be seen in the next Chapter  CHAP XIII  In which the foregoing Story is farther continued  'MY Fellow Collegiate had now entered me in a new Scene of Life I soon became acquainted with the whole Fraternity of Sharpers and was let into their Secrets I mean into the Knowledge of those gross Cheats which are proper to impose on the raw and unexperienced For there are some Tricks of a finer Kind which are only known to a few of the Gang who are at the Head of their Profession a Degree of Honour beyond my Expectation for Drink to which I was immoderately addicted and the natural Warmth of my Passions prevented me from arriving at any great Success in an Art which requires as much Coolness as the most austere School of Philosophy'  'Mr  Watson  with whom I now lived in the closest Amity had unluckily the former Failing to a very great Excess so that instead of making a Fortune by his Profession as some others did he was alternately rich and poor and was often obliged to surrender to his cooler Friends over a Bottle which they never tasted that Plunder that he had taken from Culls at the public Table'  'However we both made a Shift to pick up an uncomfortable Livelihood and for two Years I continued of the Calling during which Time I tasted all the Varieties of Fortune sometimes flourishing in Affluence and at others being obliged to struggle with almost incredible Difficulties Today wallowing in Luxury and Tomorrow reduced to the coarsest and most homely Fare My fine  Clothes being often on my Back in the Evening' and at the Pawnshop the next Morning  'One Night as I was returning Pennyless from the Gamingtable I observed a very great Disturbance and a large Mob gathered together in the Street As I was in no Danger from Pickpockets I ventered into the Croud where upon enquiry I found that a Man had been robbed and very ill used by some Ruffians The wounded Man appeared very bloody and seemed scarce able to support himself on his Legs As I had not therefore been deprived of my Humanity by my present Life and Conversation tho' they had left me very little of either Honesty or Shame I immediately offered my Assistance to the unhappy Person who thankfully accepted it and putting himself under my Conduct begged me to convey him to some Tavern where he might send for a Surgeon being as he said faint with Loss of Blood He seemed indeed highly pleased at finding one who appeared in the Dress of a Gentleman For as to all the rest of the Company present their Outside was such that he could not wisely place any Confidence in them'  'I took the poor Man by the Arm and led him to the Tavern where we kept our Rendezvous as it happened to be the nearest at Hand A Surgeon happening luckily to be in the House immediately attended and applied himself to dressing the Wounds which I had the Pleasure to hear were not likely to be mortal'  'The Surgeon having very expeditiously and dextrously finished his Business began to enquire in what Part of the Town the wounded Man lodged who answered "That he was come to Town that very Morning that his Horse was at an Inn in  Piccadilly  and that he had no other Lodging and very little or no Acquaintance in Town'  'This Surgeon whose Name I have forgot tho' I remember it began with an  R  had the first Character in his Profession and was SerjeantSurgeon to the King He had moreover many good Qualities and was a very generous goodnatured Man and ready to do any Service to his FellowCreatures He offered his Patient the Use of his Chariot to carry him to his Inn and at the same Time whispered in his Ear "That if he wanted any Money' he would furnish him  'The poor Man was not now capable of returning Thanks for this generous Offer For having had his Eyes for some Time stedfastly on me he threw himself back in his Chair crying O my Son my Son and then fainted away  'Many of the People present imagined this Accident had happened through his Loss of Blood but I who at the same Time began to recollect the Features of my Father was now confirmed in my Suspicion and satisfied that it was he himself who appeared before me I presently ran to him raised him in my Arms and kissed his cold Lips with the utmost Eagerness Here I must draw a Curtain over a Scene which I cannot describe For though I did not lose my Being as my Father for a while did my Senses were however so overpowered with Affright and Surprize that I am a Stranger to what past during some Minutes and indeed till my Father had again recovered from his Swoon and I found myself in his Arms both tenderly embracing each other while the Tears trickled apace down the Cheeks of each of us'  'Most of those present seemed affected by this Scene which we who might be considered as the Actors in it were desirous of removing from the Eyes of all Spectators as fast as we could my Father therefore  accepted the kind Offer of the Surgeon's Chariot and I attended him in it to his Inn'  'When we were alone together he gently upbraided me with having neglected to write to him during so long a Time but entirely omitted the Mention of that Crime which had occasioned it He then informed me of my Mother's Death and insisted on my returning Home with him saying That he had long suffered the greatest Anxiety on my Account that he knew not whether he had most feared my Death or wished it since he had so many more dreadful Apprenensions for me At last he said a neighbouring Gentleman who had just recovered a Son from the same Place informed him where I was and that to reclaim me from this Course of Life was the sole Cause of his Journey to  London"  'He thanked Heaven he had succeeded so far as to find me out by Means of an Accident which had like to have proved fatal to him and had the Pleasure to think he partly owed his Preservation to my Humanity with which he professed himself to be more delighted than he should have been with my filial Piety if I had known that the Object of all my Care was my own Father'  'Vice had not so depraved my Heart as to excite in it an Insensibility of so much paternal Affection tho' so unworthily bestowed I presently promised to obey his Commands in my return Home with him as soon as he was able to travel which indeed he was in a very few Days by the Assistance of that excellent Surgeon who had undertaken his Cure'  'The Day preceding my Father's Journey before which Time I scarce ever left him I went to take my Leave of some of my most intimate Acquaintance particularly of Mr  Watson  who dissuaded me from burying myself as he called it out of a  simple Compliance with the fond Desires of a foolish  old Fellow Such Solicitations however had no Effect and I once more saw my own Home My Father now greatly solicited me to think of Marriage but my Inclinations were utterly averse to  any such Thoughts I had tasted of Love already and perhaps you know the extravagant Excesses of that most tender and most violent Passion'  Here  e old Gentleman paused and looked earnestly at  ones  whose Countenance within a Minute's Space  splayed the Extremities of both red and white  pon which the old Man without making any Ob  vations renewed his Narrative  'Being now provided with all the Necessaries of Life I betook myself once again to Study and that with a more inordinate Application than I had ever done formerly The Books which now employed my Time solely were those as well ancient as modern which treat of true Philosophy a Word which is by many thought to be the Subject only of Farce and Ridicule I now read over the Works of  Aristotle  and  Plato  with the rest of those inestimable Treasures which ancient  Greece  hath bequeathed to the World  'These Authors though they instructed me in no Science by which Men may promise to themselves to acquire the least Riches or worldly Power taught me however the Art of despising the highest Acquisitions of both They elevate the Mind and steel and harden it against the capricious Invasions of Fortune They not only instruct in the Knowledge of Wisdom but confirm Men in her Habits and demonstrate plainly that this must be our Guide if we propose ever to arrive at the greatest worldly Happiness or to defend ourselves with any tolerable Security against the Misery which every where surrounds and invests us  'To this I added another Study compared to which all the Philosophy taught by the wisest Heathens is little better than a Dream and is indeed as full of Vanity as the silliest Jester ever pleased to represent it This is that divine Wisdom which is alone to be found in the Holy Scriptures for they impart to us the Knowledge and Assurance of Things much more worthy our Attention than all which this World can offer to our Acceptance Of Things which Heaven itself hath condescended to reveal to us and to the smallest Knowledge of which the highest human Wit unassisted could never ascend I began now to think all the Time I had spent with the best Heathen Writers was little more than Labour lost For however pleasant and delightful these Lessons may be or however adequate to the right Regulation of our Conduct with Respect to this World only yet when compared with the Glory revealed in Scripture their highest Documents will appear as trifling and of as little Consequence as the Rules by which Children regulate their Childish little Games and Pastime True it is that Philosophy makes us wiser but Christianity makes us better Men Philosophy elevates and steels the Mind Christianity softens and sweetens it The Former makes us the Objects of human Admiration the Latter of Divine Love That insures us a temporal but this an eternal HappinessBut I am afraid I tire you with my Rhapsody'  'Not at all' cries  Partridge  'Lud forbid we' should be tired with good Things  'I had spent' continued the Stranger 'about four Years in the most delightful Manner to myself totally given up to Contemplation and entirely unembarrassed with the Affairs of the World when I lost the best of Fathers and one whom I so sincerely  loved that my Grief at his Loss exceeds all Description I now abandoned my Books and gave myself up for a whole Month to the Efforts of Melancholy and Despair Time however the best Physician of the Mind at length brought me Relief'  Ay ay  Tempus edax Rerum'  said  Partridge  'I then' continued the Stranger 'betook myself again to my former Studies which I may say perfected my Cure For Philosophy and Religion may be called the Exercises of the Mind and when this is disordered they are as wholesome as Exercise can be to a distempered Body They do indeed produce similar Effects with Exercise For they strengthen and confirm the Mind till' Man becomes in the noble Strain of  Horace  'Fortis in seipso totus teres at{que} rotundus  'Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari  'In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna  Firm in himself who on himself relies  Polish'd and round who runs his proper Course  And breaks Misfortunes with superior Force  Here  Jones  smiled at some Conceit which intruded itself into his Imagination▪ but the Stranger I believe perceived it not and proceeded thus  'My Circumstances were now greatly altered by the Death of that best of Men For my Brother who was now become Master of the House differed so widely from me in his Inclinations and our Pursuits in Life had been so very various that we were the worst of Company to each other but what made our living together still more disagreeble was the little Harmony which could subsist between the few who resorted to me and the numerous Train of Sportsmen who often attended my Brother from the Field to the Table For such  Fellows besides the Noise and Nonsense with which they persecute the Ears of sober Men endeavour always to attack them with Affront and Contempt This was so much the Case that neither I myself nor my Friends could ever sit down to a Meal with them without being treated with Derision because we were unacquainted with the Phrases of Sportsmen For men of true Learning and almost universal Knowledge always compassionate the Ignorance of others but Fellows who excel in some little low contemptible Art are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that Art'  'In short we soon separated and I went by the Advice of a Physician to drink the  Bath  Waters For my violent Affliction added to a sedentary Life have thrown me into a kind of a paralytic Disorder for which those Waters are accounted an almost certain Cure The second Day after my arrival as I was walking by the River the Sun shone so intensely hot tho' it was early in the Year that I retired to the Shelter of some Willows and sat down by the Riverside Here I had not been seated long before I heard a Person on the other Side the Willows sighing and bemoaning himself bitterly On a sudden having uttered a most impious Oath he cried "I am resolved to bear it no longer" and directly threw himself into the Water I immediately started and ran towards the Place calling at the same Time as loudly as I could for Assistance An Angler happened luckily to be a fishing a little below me tho' some very high sedge had hid him from my Sight He immediately came up and both of us together not without some Hazard of our Lives drew the Body to the Shore At first we perceived no Sign of Life remaining but having held the Body up by the  Heels for we soon had Assistance enough it discharged a vast Quantity of Water at the Mouth and at length began to discover some Symptoms of Breathing and a little afterwards to move both its' Hands and its Legs  'An Apothecary who happened to be present among others advised that the Body which seemed now to have pretty well emptied itself of Water and which began to have many convulsive Motions should be directly taken up and carried into a warm Bed This was accordingly performed the Apothecary and myself attending'  'As we were going towards an Inn for we knew not the Man's Lodgings luckily a Woman met us who after some violent Screaming told us that the Gentleman lodged at her House'  'When I had seen the Man safely deposited there I left him to the Care of the Apothecary who I suppose used all the right Methods with him for the next Morning I heard he had perfectly recovered' his Senses  'I then went to visit him intending to search out as well as I could the Cause of his having attempted so desperate an Act and to prevent as far as I was able his pursuing such wicked Intentions for the future I was no sooner admitted into his Chamber than we both instantly knew each other for who should this Person be but my good Friend Mr  Watson  Here I will not trouble you with what past at our first Interview For I would avoid Prolixity as much as possible'  'Pray let us hear all' cries  Partridge  'I want mightily to know what brought him to  Bath'  'You shall hear every thing material' answered the Stranger and then proceeded to relate what we shall proceed to write after we have given a short breathing Time to both ourselves and the Reader  CHAP XIV  In which the Man of the Hill concludes his History  'MR  Watson'  continued the Stranger' 'very freely acquainted me that the unhappy Situation of his Circumstances occasioned by a Tide of IllLuck had in a Manner forced him to a Resolution of destroying himself'  'I now began to argue very seriously with him in Opposition to this Heathenish or indeed diabolical Principle of the Lawfulness of SelfMurder and said every Thing which occurred to me on the Subject but to my great Concern it seemed to have very little Effect on him He seemed not at all to repent of what he had done and gave me Reason to fear he would soon make a second Attempt of the like horrible kind'  'When I had finished my Discourse instead of endeavouring to answer my Arguments he looked me stedfastly in the Face and with a Smile said You are strangely altered my good Friend since I remember you I question whether any of our Bishops could make a better Argument against Suicide than you have entertained me with but unless you can find somebody who will lend me a cool Hundred I must either hang or drown or starve and in my Opinion the last Death is the most terrible of the three'  'I answered him very gravely that I was indeed altered since I had seen him last That I had found Leisure to look into my Follies and to repent of them I then advised him to pursue the same Steps and at last concluded with an Assurance that I myself would lend him a hundred Pound if it would be of any Service to his Affairs and he would not put it into the Power of a Die to deprive him of it'  'Mr  Watson  who seemed almost composed in Slumber by the former Part of my Discourse was roused by the latter He seized my Hand eagerly gave me a thousand Thanks and declared I was a Friend indeed adding that he hoped I had a better Opinion of him than to imagine he had profited so little by Experience as to put any Confidence in those damned Dice which had so often deceived him "No no" cries he "let me but once handsomely be set up again and if ever Fortune makes a broken Merchant of me afterwards I will forgive her'  'I very well understood the Language of  setting up  and  broken Merchant  I therefore said to him with a very grave Face Mr  Watson  you must endeavour to find out some Business or Employment by which you may procure yourself a Livelihood and I promise you could I see any probability of being repaid hereafter I would advance a much larger Sum than what you have mentioned to equip you in any fair and honourable Calling but as to Gaming besides the Baseness and wickedness of making it a Profession you are really to my own Knowledge unfit for it and it will end in your certain Ruin'  "Why now that's strange" answered he 'neither you nor any of my Friends would ever allow me to know any Thing of the Matter and yet I believe I am as good a Hand at every Game as any of you all and I heartily wish I was to play with you only for your whole Fortune I should desire no better Sport and I would let you name your Game into the Bargain but come my dear Boy have you the Hundred in your Pocket  'I answered I had only a Bill for  l  which I delivered him and promised to bring him the rest next Morning and after giving him a little more Avice' took my Leave  'I was indeed better than my Word For I returned to him that very Afternoon When I entered the Room I found him sitting up in his Bed at Cards with a notorious Gamester This Sight you will imagine shocked me not a little to which I may add the Mortification of seeing my Bill delivered by him to his Antagonist and thirty Guineas only given in Exchange for it'  'The other Gamester presently quitted the Room and then  Watson  declared he was ashamed to see me but says he I find Luck runs so damnably against me that I will resolve to leave off Play for ever I have thought of the kind Proposal you made me ever since and I promise you there shall be no Fault in me if I do not put it in Execution'  'Though I had no great Faith in his Promises I produced him the Remainder of the hundred in Consequence of my own for which he gave me a Note which was all I ever expected to see in Return for my Money'  'We were prevented from any further Discourse at present by the Arrival of the Apothecary who with much Joy in his Countenance and without even asking his Patient how he did proclaimed there was great News arrived in a Letter to himself which he said would shortly be public "that the Duke of  Monmouth  was landed in the West with a vast Army of  Dutch  and that another vast Fleet hovered over the Coast of  Norfolk  and was to make a Descent there in order to favour the Duke's Enterprize with a Diversion on that Side'  'This Apothecary was one of the greatest Politicians of his Time He was more delighted with the most paultry Packet than with the best Patient and the highest Joy he was capable of he received from having a Piece of News in his Possession an Hour or two sooner than any other Person in the Town His Advices however were seldom authentic for  he would swallow almost any thing as a Truth a' Humour which many made use to impose upon him  'Thus it happened with what he at present communicated for it was known within a short Time afterwards that the Duke was really landed but that his Army consisted only of a few Attendants and as to the Diversion in  Norfolk  it was entirely false'  'The Apothecary staid no longer in the Room than while he acquainted us with his News and then without saying a Syllable to his Patient on any other Subject departed to spread his Advices all over the Town'  'Events of this Nature in the Public are generally apt to eclipse all private Concerns Our Discourse therefore now became entirely political For my own Part I had been for some Time very seriously affected with the Danger to which the Protestant Religion was so visibly exposed under a Popish Prince and thought the Apprehension of it alone sufficient to justify that Insurrection For no real Security can ever be found against the persecuting Spirit of Popery when armed with Power except the depriving it of that Power as woeful Experience presently shewed You know how King  James  behaved after getting the better of this Attempt how little he valued either his Royal Word or CoronationOath or the Liberties and Rights of his People But all had not the Sense to foresee this at first and therefore the Duke of  Monmouth  was weakly supported yet all could feel when the Evil came upon them and therefore all united at last to drive out that King against whose Exclusion a great Party among us had so warmly contended during the Reign of his Brother and for whom they now fought with such Zeal and Affection'  'What you say' interrupted  Jones  'is very true and it has often struck me as the most wonderful thing I ever read of in History that so soon after this convincing Experience which brought out whole Nation to join so unanimously in expelling King  James  for the Preservation of our Religion and Liberties there should be a Party among us mad enough to desire the placing his Family again on the Throne'  You are not in earnest' answered the old Man 'there can be no such Party As bad an Opinion as I have of Mankind I cannot believe them infatuated to such a Degree There may be some hotheaded Papists led by their Priests to engage in this desperate Cause and think it a Holy War but that Protestants that Members of the Church of  England  should be such Apostates such  Felos de se  I cannot believe it no no young Man unacquainted as I am with what has past in the World for these last thirty Years I cannot be so imposed upon as to credit so foolish a Tale But I see you have a Mind to sport with my Ignorance' Can it be possible' replied  Jones  'that you have lived so much out of the World as not to know that during that Time there have been two Rebellions in favour of the Son of King  James  one of which is now actually raging in the very Heart of this Kingdom At these Words the old Gentleman started up and in a most solemn Tone of Voice conjured  Jones  by his Maker to tell him if what he said was really true Which the other as solemnly affirming he walked several Turns about the Room in a profound Silence then cried then laughed and at last fell down on his Knees and blessed God in a loud ThanksgivingPrayer for having delivered him from all Society with Human Nature which could be capable of such monstrous Extravagances  After which  being reminded by  Jones  that he had broke off his' Story he resumed it again in this Manner  'As Mankind in the Days I was speaking of was not yet arrived to that Pitch of Madness which I find they are capable of now and which to be sure I have only escaped by living alone and at a Distance from the Contagion there was a considerable Rising in favour of  Monmouth  and my Principles strongly inclining me to take the same Part I determined to join him and Mr  Watson  from different Motives concurring in the same Resolution for the Spirit of a Gamester will carry a Man as far upon such an Occasion as the Spirit of Patriotism we soon provided ourselves with all Necessaries and went to the Duke at  Bridgewater  The unfortunate Event of this Enterprize you are I conclude as well acquainted with as myself I escaped together with Mr  Watson  from the Battle at  Sedgemore  in which Action I received a slight Wound We rode near forty Miles together on the  Exeter  Road and then abandoning our Horses scrambled as well as we could through the Fields and ByeRoads till we arrived at a little wild Hut on a Common where a poor old Woman took all the Care of us she could and dressed my Wound with Salve which quickly healed it'  'Pray Sir where was the Wound' says  Partridge  The Stranger satisfied him it was in his Arm and then continued his Narrative 'Here Sir' said he 'Mr  Watson  left me the next Morning in order as he pretended to get us some Provision from the Town of  Cullumpton  butcan I relate it or can you believe itThis Mr  Watson  this Friend this base barbarous treacherous Villain betrayed me to a Party of Horse belonging to King  James  and at his Return delivered me into their Hands'  'The Soldiers being six in Number had now seized me and were conducting me to  Taunton  Goal but neither my present Situation nor the Apprehensions of what might happen to me were half so irksome to my Mind as the Company of my false Friend who having surrendered himself was likewise considered as a Prisoner tho' he was better treated as being to make his Peace at my Expence He at first endeavoured to excuse his Treachery but when he received nothing but Scorn and Upbraiding from me he soon changed his Note abused me as the most atrocious and malicious Rebel and laid all his own Guilt to my Charge who as he declared had solicited and even threatened him to make him take up Arms against his gracious as well as lawful Sovereign'  'This false Evidence for in Reality he had been much the forwarder of the two stung me to the Quick and raised an Indignation scarce conceivable by those who have not felt it However Fortune a  length took Pity on me for as we were got a little beyond  Wellington  in a narrow Lane my Guards received a false Alarm that near fifty of the Enemy were at hand upon which they shifted for themselves and left me and my Betrayer to do the same That Villain immediately ran from me and I am glad he did or I should have certainly endeavoured though I had no Arms to have executed Vengeanc  on his Baseness'  'I was now once more at Liberty and imme+diately withdrawing from the Highway into the Fields  travelled on scarce knowing which Way I went and making it my chief Care to avoid all publick Roads and all Towns nay even th  most homely Houses for I imagined every hu+  man Creature whom I saw desirous of betraying' me  'At last after rambling several Days about the Country during which the Fields afforded me the same Bed and the same Food which Nature bestows on our Savage Brothers of the Creation I at length arrived at this Place where the Solitude and Wildness of the Country invited me to fix my Abode The first Person with whom I took up my Habitation was the Mother of this old Woman with whom I remained concealed till the News of the glorious Revolution put an End to all my Apprehensions of Danger and gave me an Opportunity of once more visiting my own Home and of enquiring a little into my Affairs which I soon settled as agreeably to my Brother as to myself having resigned every thing to him for which he paid me the Sum of a thousand Pounds and settled on me an Annuity for Life'  'His Behaviour in this last Instance as in all others was selfish and ungenerous I could not look on him as my Friend nor indeed did he desire that I should so I presently took my Leave of him as well as of my other Acquaintance and from that Day to this my History is little better than a Blank'  'And is it possible Sir said  Jones  'that you can have resided here from that Day to this' 'O no Sir' answered the Gentleman 'I have been a great Traveller and there are few Parts of  Europe  with which I am not acquainted' 'I have not Sir cried  Jones  'the Assurance to ask it of you now Indeed it would be cruel after so much Breath as you have already spent But you will give me Leave to wish for some further Opportunity of hearing the excellent Observations which a Man of your Sense and Knowledge of the World must have made in so long a Course of Travels'  Indeed  young Gentleman' answered the Stranger 'I will endeavour to satisfy your Curiosity on this Head likewise as far as I am able'  Jones  attempted fresh Apologies but was prevented and while he and  Partridge  sat with greedy and impatient Ears the Stranger proceeded as in the next Chapter  CHAP XV  A brief History of  Europe  And a curious Discourse between Mr  Jones  and the Man of the Hill  IN  Italy  the Landlords are very silent In  France  they are more talkative but yet civil In  Germany  and  Holland  they are generally very impertinent And as for their Honesty I believe it is pretty equal in all those Countries The  Laquais a Louange  are sure to lose no Opportunity of cheating you And as for the Postilions I think they are pretty much alike all the World over These Sir are the Observations on Men which I made in my Travels for these were the only Men I ever conversed with My Design when I went abroad was to divert myself by seeing the wondrous Variety of Prospects Beasts Birds Fishes Insects and Vegetables with which God has been pleased to enrich the several Parts of this Globe A Variety which as it must give great Pleasure to a contemplative Beholder so doth it admirably display the Power and Wisdom and Goodness of the Creator Indeed to say the Truth there is but one Work in his whole Creation that doth him any Dishonour and with that I have long since avoided' holding any Conversation  'You will pardon me' cries  Jones  'but I have always imagined that there is in this very Work you mention as great Variety as in all the rest  for besides the Difference of Inclination Customs and Climates have I am told introduced the utmost Diversity into Human Nature' 'Very little indeed' answered the other 'those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different Manners of Men might spare themselves much Pains by going to a Carnival at  Venice  for there they will see at once all which they can discover in the several Parts of  Europe  The same Hypocrisy the same Fraud in short the same Follies and Vices dressed in different Habits In  Spain  these are equipped with much Gravity and in  Italy  with vast Splendor In  France  a Knave is dressed like a Fop and in the Northern Countries like a Sloven But human Nature is every where the same every where the Object of Detestation and Scorn'  'As for my own Part I past through all these Nations as you perhaps may have done through a Croud at a Shew jostling to get by them holding my Nose with one Hand and defending my Pockets with the other without speaking a Word to any of them while I was pressing on to see what I wanted to see which however entertaining it might be in itself scarce made me Amends for the Trouble the Company gave me'  'Did not you find some of the Nations among which you travelled less troublesome to you than others said  Jones'  'O yes' replied the old Man the  Turks  were much more tolerable to me than the  Christians  For they are Men of profound Taciturnity and never disturb a Stranger with Questions Now and then indeed they bestow a short Curse upon him or spit in his Face as he walks the Streets but then they have done with him and a Man may live an Age in their Country without hearing a Dozen Words from them But of all the People I ever saw Heaven defend me from the  French  With their damned Prate and Civilities and doing the Honour of their Nation to Strangers as they are pleased to call it but indeed setting forth their own Vanity they are so troublesome that I had infinitely rather pass my Life with the  Hottentots  than set my Foot in  Paris  again They are a nasty People but their Nastiness is mostly  without  whereas in  France  and some other Nations that I won't name it is all  within  and makes them stink much more to my Reason than that of  Hottentots  does to my Nose'  'Thus Sir I have ended the History of my Life for as to all that Series of Years during which I have lived retired here it affords no Variety to entertain you and may be almost considered as one Day The Retirement has been so compleat that I could hardly have enjoyed a more absolute Solitude in the Deserts of the  Thebais  than here in the midst of this populous Kingdom As I have no Estate I am plagued with no Tenants or Stewards my Annuity is paid me pretty regularly as indeed it ought to be for it is much less than what I might have expected in Return for what I gave up Visits I admit none and the old Woman who keeps my House knows that her Place entirely depends upon her saving me all the Trouble of buying the Things that I want keeping off all Sollicitation or Business from me and holding her Tongue whenever I am within hearing As my Walks are all by Night I am pretty secure in this wild and unfrequented Place from meeting any Company Some few Persons I have met by Chance and sent them Home heartily frighted as from the Oddness of my Dress and Figure they took me for a Ghost or a Hobgoblin But what has happened to Night shews that even here I cannot be safe from the Villany of  Men for without your Assistance I had not only been robbed but very probably murdered'  Jones  thanked the Stranger for the trouble he had taken in relating his Story and then expressed some Wonder how he could possibly endure a Life of such Solitude  'in which' says he 'you may well complain of the Want of Variety Indeed I am astonished how you have filled up or rather killed so much of your Time'  'I am not at all surprized' answered the other that to one whose Affections and Thoughts are fixed on the World my Hours should appear to have wanted Employment in this Place but there is one single Act for which the whole Life of Man is infinitely too short What Time can suffice for the Contemplation and Worship of that glorious immortal and eternal Being among the Works of whose stupendous Creation not only this Globe but even those numberless Luminaries which we may here behold spangling all the Sky tho' they should many of them be Suns lighting different Systems of Worlds may possibly appear but as a few Atoms opposed to the whole Earth which we inhabit Can a Man who by Divine Meditations is admitted as it were into the Conversation of this ineffable incomprehensible Majesty think Days or Years or Ages too long for the Continuance of so ravishing an Honour Shall the trifling Amusements the palling Pleasures the silly Business of the World roll away our Hours too swiftly from us and shall the Pace of Time seem sluggish to a Mind exercised in Studies so high so important and so glorious As no Time is sufficient so no Place is improper for this great Concern On what Object can we cast our Eyes which may not inspire us with Ideas of his Power of his Wisdom and of his Goodness It is not necessary that the  rising Sun should dart his fiery Glories over the Eastern Horizon nor that the boisterous Winds should rush from their Caverns and shake the lofty Forest nor that the opening Clouds should pour their Deluges on the Plains It is not necessary I say that any of these should proclaim his Majesty there is not an Insect not a Vegetable of so low an Order in the Creation as not to be honoured with bearing Marks of the Attributes of its great Creator Marks not only of his Power but of his Wisdom and Goodness Man alone the King of this Globe the last and greatest Work of the Supreme Being below the Sun Man alone hath basely dishonoured his own Nature and by Dishonesty Cruelty Ingratitude and Treachery hath called his Maker's Goodness in Question by puzzling us to account how a benevolent Being should form so foolish and so vile an Animal Yet this is the Being from whose Conversation you think I suppose that I have been unfortunately restrained and without whose blessed Society Life in your Opinion must be tedious and insipid'  'In the former Part of what you said' replied  Jones  'I most heartily and readily concur but I believe as well as hope that the Abhorrence which you express for Mankind in the Conclusion is much too general Indeed you here fall into an Error which in my little Experience I have observed to be a very common one by taking the Character of Mankind from the worst and basest among them whereas indeed as an excellent Writer observes nothing should be esteemed as characteristical of a Species but what is to be found among the best and most perfect Individuals of that species This Error I believe is generally committed by those who from Want of proper Caution in the Choice of their Friends and Acquaintance have  suffered injuries from bad and worthless Men two or three Instances of which are very unjustly charged on all Human Nature'  'I think I had Experience enough of it' answered he other 'My first Mistress and my first Friend betrayed me in the basest Manner and in Matters which threatened to be of the worst of Consequences even to bring me to a shameful Death'  'But you will pardon me' cries  Jones  'if I desire you to reflect who that Mistress and who that Friend were What better my good Sir could be expected in Love derived from the Stews or in Friendship first produced and nourished at the GamingTable To take the Characters of Women from the former Instance or of Men from the latter would be as unjust as to assert that Air is a+nauseous an unwholesome Element because we find it so in a Jakes I have lived but a short Time in the World and yet have known Men worthy of the highest Friendship and Women of the highest Love'  'Alas young Man' answered the Stranger 'you have lived you confess but a very short Time in the World I was somewhat older than you when I was of the same Opinion'  'You might have remained so still' replies  Jones  'if you had not been unfortunate I will venture to say incautious in the placing your Affections If there was indeed much more Wickedness in the World than there is it would not prove such general Assertions against human Nature since much of this arrives by mere Accident and many a Man who commits Evil is not totally bad and corrupt in his Heart In Truth none seem to have any Title to assert Human Nature to be necessarily and universally evil but those whose own Minds afford them one Instance of this natural Depravity which is not I am convinced your Case'  'And such' said the Stranger 'will be always the most backward to assert any such thing Knaves will no more endeavour to persuade us of the Baseness of Mankind than a Highwayman will inform you that there are Thieves on the Road This would indeed be a Method to put you on your Guard and to defeat their own Purposes For which Reason tho' Knaves as I remember are very apt to abuse particular Persons yet they never cast any Reflection on Human Nature in general'  The old Gentleman spoke this so warmly that as  Jones  despaired of making a Convert and was unwilling to offend he returned no Answer  The Day now began to send forth its first Streams of Light when  Jones  made an Apology to the Stranger for his having staid so long and perhaps having detained him from his Rest The Stranger answered  'He never wanted Rest less than at present for that Day and Night were indifferent Seasons to him and that he commonly made use of the former for the Time of his Repose and of the latter for his Walks and Lucubrations However' said he 'it is now a most lovely Morning and if you can bear any longer to be without your own Rest or Food I will gladly entertain you with the Sight of some very fine Prospects which I believe you have not yet seen'  Jones  very readily embraced this Offer and they immediately set forward together from the Cottage As for  Partridge  he had fallen into a profound Repose just as the Stranger had finished his Story for his Curiosity was satisfied and the subsequent Discourse was not forcible enough in its Operation to conjure down the Charms of Sleep  Jones  therefore left him to enjoy his Nap and as the Reader may perhaps be at this Season glad of the same Favour we will here put an End to the Eighth Book of our History  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK IX  Containing twelve Hours  CHAP I  Of those who lawfully may and of those who may not write such Histories as this  AMONG other good Uses for which I have thought proper to institute these several introductory Chapters I have considered them as a Kind of Mark or Stamp which may hereafter enable a very indifferent Reader to distinguish what is true and genuine in this historic kind of Writing from what is false and counterfeit Indeed it seems likely that some such Mark may shortly become necessary since the favourable Reception which two or three Authors have lately procured for their Works of this Nature from the Public will probably serve as an Encroachment to many others to undertake the like Thus a Swarm of foolish Novels and monstrous Romances will be produced either to the great impoverishing of Booksellers or to the great Loss of Time and Depravation of Morals in the Reader  nay often to the spreading of Scandal and Calumny and to the Prejudice of the Characters of many worthy and honest People  I question not but the ingenious Author of the Spectator was principally induced to perfix  Greek  and  Latin  Mottos to every Paper from the same Consideration of guarding against the Pursuit of those Scribblers who having no Talents of a Writer but what is taught by the Writingmaster are yet no wise afraid nor more ashamed to assume the same Titles with the greatest Genius than their good Brother in the Fable was of braying in the Lion's Skin  By the Device therefore of his Motto it became impracticable for any Man to presume to imitate the Spectators without understanding at least one Sentence in the learned Languages In the same Manner I have now secured myself from the Imitation of those who are utterly incapable of any Degree of Reflection and whose Learning is not equal to an Essay  I would not here be understood to insinuate that the greatest Merit of such historical Productions can ever lie in these introductory Chapters but in Fact those Parts which contain mere Narrative only afford much more Encouragement to the Pen of an Imitator than those which are composed of Observation and Reflection Here I mean such Imitators as  Rowe  was of  Shakespear  or as  Horace  hints some of the the  Romans  were of  Cato  by bare Feet and sour Faces  To invent good Stories and to tell them well are possibly very rare Talents and yet I have observed few Persons who have scrupled to aim at both and if we examine the Romances and Novels with which the world abounds I think we may fairly conclude that most of the Authors would not have attempted to shew their Teeth if the Expression may be allowed me in any other Way of Writing nor could indeed have strung together a dozen Sentences on any other Subject whatever  Scribimus indocti docti{que}  passim  Each desperate Blockhead dares to write  Verse is the Trade of every living Wight  FRANCIS  may be more truly said of the Historian and Biographer than of any other Species of Writing For all the Arts and Sciences even Criticism itself  equire some little Degree of Learning and Know  ege Poetry indeed may perhaps be thought an Ex  eption but then it demands Numbers or something  ike Numbers whereas to the Composition of No  els and Romances nothing is necessary but Paper Pens and Ink with the manual Capacity of using them This I conceive their Productions shew to be the Opinion of the Authors themselves and this must be the Opinion of their Readers if indeed there be any such  Hence we are to derive that universal Contempt which the World who always denominate the Whole from the Majority have cast on all historical Writers who do not draw their Materials from Records And it is the Apprehension of this Contempt that  ath made us so cautiously avoid the Term Romance  Name with which we might otherwise have been well enough contented Though as we have good Authority for all our Characters no less indeed than  oomsday Book or the vast authentic Book of Nature as is elsewhere hinted our Labours have sufficient Title to the Name of History Certainly they de  erve some Distinction from those Works which one of he wittiest of Men regarded only as proceeding from a Pruritus or indeed rather from a Looseness of the Brain  But besides the Dishonour which is thus cast on one of the most useful as well as entertaining of all Kinds of Writing there is just Reason to apprehend that  y encouraging such Authors we shall propagate much Dishonuur of another Kind I mean to the Characters of many good and valuable Members of Society For the dullest Writers no more than the  ullest Companions are always inoffensive They  ave both enough of Language to be indecent and abusive  And surely if the Opinion just above cited be true we cannot wonder that Works so nastily derived should be nasty themselves or have a Tendency to make others so  To prevent therefore for the future such intemperate Abuses of Leisure of Letters and of the Liberty of the Press especially as the World seems a  present to be more than usually threatned with them I shall here venture to mention some Qualifications every one of which are in a pretty high Degree necessary to this Order of Historians  The first is Genius without a rich Vein of which no Study says  Horace  can avail us By Genius would understand that Power or rather those Power of the Mind which are capable of penetrating into all Things within our Reach and Knowledge and o  distinguishing their essential Differences These are no other than Invention and Judgment and they are both called by the collective Name of Genius as they are o  those Gifts of Nature which we bring with us into the World Concerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great Errors For by Invention I believe is generally understood a creative Faculty which would indeed prove most RomanceWriters to have the highest Pretensions to it whereas by Invention is really meant no more and so the Word signifies than Discovery or finding out or to explain it a  large a quick and sagacious Penetration into the tru  Essence of all the Objects of our Contemplation This I think can rarely exist without the Concomi  tancy of Judgment For how we can be said to have discovered the true Essence of two Things without discerning their Difference seems to me hard to conceive now this last is the undisputed Province of Judgement and yet some few Men of Wit have agree  with all the dull Fellows in the World in representing these two to have been seldom or never the Property of one and the same Person  But tho' they should be so they are not sufficient  r our Purpose without a good Share of Learning  r which I could again cite the Authority of  Horace  nd of many others if any was necessary to prove  hat Tools are of no Service to a Workman when  hey are not sharpened by Art or when he wants  ules to direct him in his Work or hath no Matter  work upon All these Uses are supplied by Learning For Nature can only furnish us with Capacity  as I have chose to illustrate it with the Tools  f our Profession Learning must fit them for Use must direct them in it and lastly must contribute  art at least of the Materials A competent Know  edge of History and of the  Belles Letters  is here ab  olutely necessary and without this Share of Know  edge at least to affect the Character of an Historian  as vain as to endeavour at building a House without Timber or Mortar or Brick or Stone  Homer  and  Milton  who though they added the Ornament of Numbers to their Works were both Historians of our Order were Masters of all the Learning of their Times  Again there is another Sort of Knowledge beyond  e Power of Learning to bestow and this is to be  ad by Conversation So necessary is this to the understanding the Characters of Men that none are more  gnorant of them than those learned Pedants whose  ives have been entirely consumed in Colleges and  mong Books For however exquisitely Human Na  re may have been described by Writers the true  ractical System can only be learnt in the World  ndeed the like happens in every other Kind of Know  dge Neither Physic nor Law are to be practi  ally known from Books Nay the Farmer the  lanter the Gardener must perfect by Experience what he hath acquired the Rudiments of by Reading How accurately soever the ingenious Mr  Miller  may  ave described the Plant he himself would advise his  isciple to see it in the Garden As we must perceive  that after the nicest strokes of a  Shakespear  or  Johnson  of a  Wycherly  or an  Otway  some To  +ches of Nature will escape the Reader which the ju+dicious Action of a  Garrick  of a  Cibber  or a  Cli  There is a peculiar Propriety in mentioning this gr  Actor and these two most justly celebrated Actresses in t  Place as they have all formed themselves on the Study Nature only and not on the Imitation of their Pre+cessors Hence they have been able to excel all who h  gone before them a degree of Merit which the serv  Herd of Imitators can never possibly arrive at  can convey to him so on the real Stage th  Character shews himself in a stronger and bold  Light than he can be described And if this be th  Case in those fine and nervous Descriptions which great Authors themselves have taken from Life ho  much more strongly will it hold when the Writer him self takes his Lines not from Nature but from Book Such Characters are only the faint Copy of a Copy and can have neither the Justness nor Spirit of a Original  Now this Conversation in our Historian must universal that is with all Ranks and Degrees of Me  For the Knowledge of what is called HighLif  will not instruct him in low nor  e converso  will  being acquainted with the inferior Part of Mankin  teach him the Manners of the superior And thoug  it may be thought that the Knowledge of either m  sufficiently enable him to describe at least that in whic  he hath been conversant yet he will even here  greatly short of Perfection for the Follies of eith  Rank do in reality illustrate each other For Instance t  Affectation of Highlife appears more glaring and  diculous from the Simplicity of the Low and ag  the rudeness and barbarity of this latter strikes w  much stronger Ideas of Absurdity when contras  with and opposed to the Politeness which contro  the former Besides to say the Truth the Mann  of our Historian will be improved by both these Conversations For in the one he will easily find Examples of Plainness Honesty and Sincerity in the other of Refinement Elegance and a Liberality of Spirit which last Quality I myself have scarce ever  een in Men of low Birth and Education  Nor will all the Qualities I have hitherto given my Historian avail him unless he have what is generally meant by a good Heart and be capable of feeling The Author who will make me weep says  Horace  must first weep himself In reality no Man  an paint a Distress well which he doth not feel while  e is painting it nor do I doubt but that the most  athetic and affecting Scenes have been writ with Tears In the same Manner it is with the Ridiculous  am convinced I never make my Reader laugh hear  ly but where I have laughed before him unless it  hould happen at any Time that instead of laughing with me he should be inclined to laugh at me Perhaps this may have been the Case at some Pas  ages in this Chapter from which Apprehensions I will here put an End to it  CHAP II  Containing a very surprizing Adventure indeed which Mr  Jones  met with in his Walk with the Man of the Hill  AURORA  now first opened her Casement  anglicè  the Day began to break when  Jones  walked  orth in Company with the Stranger and mounted  Mazard  Hill of which they had no sooner gained  he Summit than one of the most noble Prospects in  he World presented itself to their View and which  e would likewise present to the Reader but for two Reasons  First  We despair of making those who  ave seen this Prospect admire our Description  Secondly  We very much doubt whether those who have  ot seen it would understand it  Jones  stood for some Minutes fixed in one Posture and directing his Eyes towards the South upon which the old Gentleman asked What he was looking at with so much Attention  'Alas Sir' answered he with a Sigh 'I was endeavouring to trace out my own Journey hither Good Heavens what a Distance is  Gloucester  from us What a vast Tract of Land must be between me and my own Home' Ay ay young Gentleman' cries the other 'and by your Sighing from what you love better than your own Home or I am mistaken I perceive now the Object of your Contemplation is not within your Sight and yet I fancy you have a Pleasure in looking that Way'  Jones  answered with a Smile I find old Friend you have not yet forgot the Sensations of your YouthI own my Thoughts were employed as you have guessed'  They now walked to that Part of the Hill which looks to the North West and which hangs over a vas  and extensive Wood Here they were no sooner ar+rived than they heard at a Distance the most violent Skreams of a Woman proceeding from the Wood below them  Jones  listened a Moment and then without saying a Word to his Companion for indeed the Occasion seemed sufficiently pressing ran or rather slid down the Hill and without the least Apprehensions or Concern for his own Safety made directly to the Thicket whence the Sound had issued  He had not entered far into the Wood before he beheld a most shocking Sight indeed a Woman strip half naked under the Hands of a Ruffian who had put his Garter round her Neck and was endeavouring to draw her up to a Tree  Jones  asked no Questions at this Interval but fell instantly upon the Villian and made such good Use of his trusty Oaken Stick  that he laid him sprawling on the Ground before h  could defend himself indeed almost before he knew he was attacked nor did he cease the Prosecution o  his Blows till the Woman herself begged him to forbear saying She believed he had sufficiently done his Business  The poor Wretch then fell upon her Knees to  Jones  and gave him a thousand Thanks for her De  iverance He presently lifted her up and told her  e was highly pleased with the extraordinary Acci  ent which had sent him thither for her Relief where  t was so improbable she should find any adding  hat Heaven seemed to have designed him as the hap  y Instrument of her Protection 'Nay' answer  d she 'I could almost conceive you to be some good Angel and to say the Truth you look more like an Angel than a Man in my Eye' Indeed he was a charming Figure and if a very fine Person  nd a most comely Set of Features adorned with Youth Health Strength Freshness Spirit and Good Nature can make a Man resemble an Angel he certainly had that Resemblance  The redeemed Captive had not altogether so much of the humanangelic Species she seemed to be at  east of the middle Age nor had her Face much Ap  earance of Beauty but her Cloaths being torn from  ll the upper Part of the Body her Breasts which were well formed and extremely white attracted  he Eyes of her Deliverer and for a few Moments  hey stood silent and gazing at each other till the Ruffian on the Ground beginning to move  Jones  ook the Garter which had been intended for another  urpose and bound both his Hands behind him And  ow on contemplating his Face he discovered great  y to his Surprize and perhaps not a little to his Satisfaction this very Person to be no other than En  gn  Northerton  Nor had the Ensign forgotten his for  er Antagonist whom he knew the Moment he came  o himself His Surprize was equal to that of  Jones  ut I conceive his Pleasure was rather less on this Occasion  Jones  helped  Northerton  upon his Legs and then looking him stedfastly in the Face  'I fancy Sir' said he 'you did not expect to meet me any more in this World and I confess I had as little Expectation to find you here However Fortune I see hath brought us once more together and hath given me Satisfaction for the Injury I have received even without my own Knowledge'  'It is very much like a Man of Honour indeed' answered  Northerton  'to take Satisfaction by knocking a Man down behind his Back Neither am I capable of giving you Satisfaction here as I have no Sword but if you dare behave like a Gentleman let us go where I can furnish myself with one and I will do by you as a Man of Honour ought'  'Doth it become such a Villain as you are' cries  Jones  'to contaminate the Name of Honour by assuming it But I shall waste no Time in Discourse with youJustice requires Satisfaction of you now and shall have it'  Then turning to the Woman he asked her if she was near her Home or if not whether she was acquainted with any House in the Neighbourhood where she might procure herself some decent Cloaths in order to proceed to a Justice of the Peace  She answered She was an entire Stranger in that Part of the World  Jones  then recollecting himself said he had a Friend near who would direct them indeed he wondered at his not following but in Fact the Good Man of the Hill when our Heroe departed sat himself down on the Brow where tho' he had a Gun in his Hand he with great Patience and Unconcern had attended the Issue  Jones  then stepping without the Wood perceived the old Man sitting as we have just described him he presently exerted his utmost Agility and with surprizing Expedition ascended the Hill  The old Man advised him to carry the Woman to  Upton  which he said was the nearest Town and there he would be sure of furnishing her with all manner of Conveniences  Jones  having received his Direction to the Place took his Leave of the Man of the Hill and desiring him to direct  Partridge  the same Way returned hastily to the Wood  Our Heroe at his Departure to make this Enquiry of his Friend had considered that as the Ruffian's Hands were tied behind him he was incapable of executing any wicked Purposes on the poor Woman Besides he knew he should not be beyond the Reach of her Voice and could return soon enough to prevent any Mischief He had moreover declared to the Villain that if he attempted the least Insult he would be himself immediately the Executioner of Vengeance on him But  Jones  unluckily forgot that tho' the Hands of  Northerton  were tied his Legs were at Liberty nor did he lay the least Injunction on the Prisoner that he should not make what use of these he pleased  Northerton  therefore having given no Parole of that Kind thought he might without any Breach of Honour depart not being obliged as he imagined by any Rules to wait for a formal Discharge He therefore took up his Legs which were at Liberty and walked off thro' the Wood which favoured his Retreat nor did the Woman whose Eyes were perhaps rather turned towards her Deliverer once think of his Escape or give herself any Concern or Trouble to prevent it  Jones  therefore at his Return found the Woman alone He would have spent some Time in searching for  Northerton  but she would not permit him earnestly entreating that he would accompany her to the Town whither they had been directed  'As to the Fellow's Escape' said she 'it gives me no Uneasiness For Philosophy and Christianity both preach up Forgiveness of Injuries But for you Sir I  am concerned at the Trouble I give you nay indeed my Nakedness may well make me ashamed to look you in the Face and if it was not for the Sake of your Protection I should wish to go alone'  Jones  offered her his Coat but I know not for what Reason she absolutely refused the most earnest Solicitations to accept it He then begged her to forget both the Causes of her Confusion  'With Regard to the former' says he 'I have done no more than my Duty in protecting you and as for the latter I will entirely remove it by walking before you all the Way for I would not have my Eyes offend you and I could not answer for my Power of resisting the attractive Charms of so much Beauty'  Thus our Heroe and the redeemed Lady walked in the same Manner as  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  marched heretofore But tho' I cannot believe that  Jones  was designedly tempted by his Fair One to look behind him yet as she frequently wanted his Assistance to help her over Stiles and had besides many Trips and other Accidents he was often obliged to turn about However he had better Fortune than what attended poor  Orpheus  for he brought his Companion or rather Follower safe into the famous Town of  Upton  CHAP III  The Arrival of Mr  Jones  with his Lady at the Inn with a very full Description of the Battle of  Upton  THO' the Reader we doubt not is very eager to know what this Lady was and how she fell into the Hands of Mr  Northerton  we must beg him to suspend his Curiosity for a short Time as we are obliged for some very good Reasons which hereafter  perhaps he may guess to delay his Satisfaction a little longer  Mr  Jones  and his fair Companion no sooner entered the Town than they went directly to that Inn which in their Eyes presented the fairest Appearance to the Street Here  Jones  having ordered a Servant to shew a Room above Stairs was ascending when the dishevelled Fair hastily following was laid hold on by the Master of the House who cried  'Hey day where is that Beggar Wench going stay below Stairs I desire you'  but  Jones  at that Instant thundered from above 'Let the Lady come 'up' in so authoritative a Voice that the good Man instantly withdrew his Hands and the Lady made the best of her way to the Chamber  Here  Jones  wished her Joy of her safe Arrival and then departed in order as he promised to send the Landlady up with some Cloaths The poor Woman thanked him heartily for all his Kindness and said She should see him again soon to thank him a thousand Times more During this short Conversation she covered her white Bosom as well as she could possibly with her Arms For  Jones  could not avoid stealing a Peep or two tho' he took all imaginable Care to avoid giving any Offence  Our Travellers had happened to take up their Residence at a House of exceeding good Repute whither  Irish  Ladies of strict Virtue and many Northern Lasses of the same Predicament were accustomed to resort in their Way to  Bath  The Landlady therefore would by no Means have admitted any Conversation of a disreputable Kind to pass under her Roof Indeed so foul and contagious are all such Proceedings that they contaminate the very innocent Scenes where they are committed and give the Name of a bad House or of a House of ill Repute to all those where they are suffered to be carried on  Not that I would intimate that such strict Chastity as was preserved in the Temple of  Vesta  can possibly be maintained at a public Inn My good Landlady did not hope for such a Blessing nor would any of the Ladies I have spoken of or indeed any others of the most rigid Note have expected or insisted on any such Thing But to exclude all Vulgar Concubinage and to drive all Whores in Rags from within the Walls is within the Power of every one This my Landlady very stiffly adhered to and this her virtuous Guests who did not travel in Rags would very reasonably have expected of her  Now it required no very blameable Degree of Suspicion to imagine that Mr  Jones  and his ragged Companion had certain Purposes in their Intention which tho' tolerated in some Christian Countries connived at in others and practised in all are however as expressly forbidden as Murder or any other horrid Vice by that Religion which is universally believed in those Countries The Landlady therefore had no sooner received an Intimation of the Entrance of the abovesaid Persons than she began to meditate the most expeditious Means for their Expulsion In order to this she had provided herself with a long and deadly Instrument with which in Times of Peace the Chambermaid was wont to demolish the Labours of the Industrious Spider In vulgar Phrase she had taken up the Broomstick and was just about to sally from the Kitchen when  Jones  accosted her with a Demand of a Gown and other Vestments to cover the half naked woman above Stairs  Nothing can be more provoking to the human Temper nor more dangerous to that cardinal Virtue Patience than Solicitations of extraordinary Offices of Kindness on Behalf of those very Persons with whom we are highly incensed For this Reason  Shakespear  hath artfully introduced his  Desdemona  soliciting Favours for  Cassio  of her Husband as the Means of enflaming not only his Jealousy but his Rage to the highest Pitch of Madness and we find the unfortunate Moor less able to Command his Passion on this Occasion than even when he beheld his valued Present to his Wife in the Hands of his supposed Rival In Fact we regard these Efforts as Insults on our Understanding and to such the Pride of Man is very difficultly brought to submit  My Landlady though a very goodtempered Woman had I suppose some of this Pride in her Composition for  Jones  had scarce ended his Request when she fell upon him with a certain Weapon which tho' it be neither long nor sharp nor hard nor indeed threatens from its Appearance with either Death or Wound hath been however held in great Dread and Abhorrence by many wise Men nay by many brave ones insomuch that some who have dared to look into the Mouth of a loaded Cannon have not dared to look into a Mouth where this Weapon was brandished and rather than run the Hazard of its Execution have contented themselves with making a most pitiful and sneaking Figure in the Eyes of all their Acquaintance  To Confess the Truth I am afraid Mr  Jones  was one of these for tho' he was attacked and violently belaboured with the aforesaid Weapon he could not be provoked to make any Resistance but in a most cowardly Manner applied with many Entreatries to his Antagonist to desist from pursuing her Blows in plain  English  he only begged her with the utmost Earnestness to hear him but before he could obtain his Request my Landlord himself entered into the Fray and embraced that Side of the Cause which seemed to stand very little in need of Assistance  There are a Sort of Heroes who are supposed to be determined in their chusing or avoiding a Conflict by the Character and Behaviour of the Person whom they are to engage These are said to know their Man and  Jones  I believe knew his Woman for tho' he had been so submissive to her he was no sooner attacked by her Husband than he demonstrated an immediate Spirit of Resentment and enjoined him Silence under a very severe Penalty no less than that I think of being converted into Fuel for his own Fire  The Husband with great Indignation but with a Mixture of Pity answered  'You must pray first to be made able I believe I am a better Man than yourself ay every Way that I am'  and presently proceeded to discharge half a dozen Whores at the Lady above Stairs the last of which had scarce issued from his Lips when a swinging Blow from the Cudgel that  Jones  carried in his Hand assaulted him over the Shoulders  It is a Question whether the Landlord or the Landlady was the most expeditious in returning this Blow My Landlord whose Hands were empty fell to with his Fist and the good Wife uplifting her Broom and aiming at the Head of  Jones  had probably put an immediate End to the Fray and to  Jones  likewise had not the Descent of this Broom been preventednot by the miraculous Intervention of any Heathen Deity but by a very natural tho' fortunate Accident  viz  by the Arrival of  Partridge  who entered the House at that Instant for Fear had caused him to run every Step from the Hill and who seeing the Danger which threatened his Master o  Companion which you chuse to call him prevented so sad a Catastrophe by catching hold of the Landlady's Arm as it was brandished aloft in the Air  The Landlady soon perceived the Impediment which prevented her Blow and being unable to  rescue her Arm from the Hands of  Partridge  she let fall the Broom and then leaving  Jones  to the Discipline of her Husband she fell with the utmost Fury on that poor Fellow who had already given some Intimation of himself by crying 'Zounds do 'you intend to kill my Friend'  Partridge  though not much addicted to Battle would not however stand still when his Friend was attacked nor was he much displeased with that Part of the Combat which fell to his Share He therefore returned my Landlady's Blows as soon as he received them and now the Fight was obstinately maintained on all Parts and it seemed doubtful to which Side Fortune would incline when the naked Lady who had listened at the Top of the Stairs to the Dialogue which preceded the Engagement descended suddenly from above and without weighing the unfair Inequality of two to one fell upon the poor Woman who was boxing with  Partridge  nor did that great Champion desist but rather redoubled his Fury when he found fresh Succours were arrived to his Assistance  Victory must now have fallen to the Side of the Travellers for the bravest Troops must yield to Numbers had not  Susan  the Chambermaid come luckily to support her Mistress This  Susan  was as twohanded a Wench according to the Phrase as any in the Country and would I believe have beat the famed  Thalestris  herself or any of her subject  Amazons  for her Form was robust and manlike and every Way made for such Encounters As her Hands and Arms were formed to give Blows with great Mischief to an Enemy so was her Face as well contrived to receive Blows without any great Injury to herself Her Nose being already flat to her Face her Lips were so large that no Swelling could be perceived in them and moreover they were so hard  that a Fist could hardly make any Impression on them Lastly her CheekBones stood out as if Nature had intended them for two Bastions to defend her Eyes in those Encounters for which she seemed so well calculated and to which she was most wonderfully well inclined  This fair Creature entering the Field of Battle immediately filed to that Wing where her Mistress maintained so unequal a Fight with one of either Sex Here she presently challenged  Partridge  to single Combat He accepted the Challenge and a most desperate Fight began between them  Now the Dogs of War being let loose began to lick their bloody Lips now Victory with Golden Wings hung hovering in the Air Now Fortune taking her Scales from her Shelf began to weigh the Fates of  Tom Jones  his Female Companion and  Partridge  against the Landlord his Wife and Maid all which hung in exact Ballance before her when a goodnatured Accident put suddenly an End to the bloody Fray with which half of the Combatants had already sufficiently feasted This Accident was the Arrival of a Coach and four upon which my Landlord and Landlady immediately desisted from fighting and at their Entreaty obtained the same Favour of their Antagonists but  Susan  was not so kind to  Partridge  for that  Amazonian  Fair having overthrown and bestrid her Enemy was now cuffing him lustily with both her Hands without any Regard to his Request of a Cessation of Arms or to those loud Acclamations of Murder which he roared forth  No sooner however had  Jones  quitted the Landlord than he flew to the Rescue of his defeated Companion from whom he with much Difficulty drew off the enraged Chambermaid but  Partridge  was not immediately sensible of his Deliverance for he still lay flat on the Floor guarding his Face with his Hands nor did he cease roaring till  Jones  had forced  him to look up and to perceive that the Battle was at an End  The Landlord who had no visible Hurt and the Landlady hiding her well scratched Face with her Handkerchief ran both hastily to the Door to attend the Coach from which a young Lady and her Maid now alighted These the Landlady presently ushered into that Room where Mr  Jones  had at first deposited his fair Prize as it was the best Apartment in the House Hither they were obliged to pass through the Field of Battle which they did with the utmost Haste covering their Faces with their Handkerchiefs as desirous to avoid the Notice of any one Indeed their Caution was quite unnecessary For the poor unfortunate  Helen  the fatal Cause of all the Bloodshed was entirely taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own Face and  Jones  was no less occupied in rescuing  Partridge  from the Fury of  Susan  which being happily effected the poor Fellow immediately departed to the Pump to wash his Face and to stop that bloody Torrent which  Susan  had plentifully set a flowing from his Nostrils  CHAP IV  In which the Arrival of a Man of War puts a final End to Hostilities and causes the Conclusion of a firm and lasting Peace between all Parties  A Serjeant and a File of Musqueteers with a Deserter in their Custody arrived about this Time The Serjeant presently enquired for the principal Magistrate of the Town and was informed by my Landlord that he himself was vested in that Office He then demanded his Billets together with a Mug of Beer and complaining it was cold spread himself before the Kitchen Fire  Mr  Jones  was at this Time comforting the poor distressed Lady who sat down at a Table in the  Kitchen and leaning her Head upon her Arm was bemoaning her Misfortunes but lest my fair Readers should be in Pain concerning a particular Circumstance I think proper here to acquaint them that before she had quitted the Room above Stairs she had so well covered herself with a Pillowbere which she there found that her Regard to Decency was not in the least violated by the Presence of so many Men as were now in the Room  One of the Soldiers now went up to the Serjeant and whispered something in his Ear upon which he stedfastly fixed his Eyes on the Lady and having looked at her for near a Minute he came up to her saying  'I ask Pardon Madam but I am certain I am not deceived you can be no other Person than Captain  Waters  's Lady'  The poor Woman who in her present Distress had very little regarded the Face of any Person present no sooner looked at the Serjeant than she presently recollected him and calling him by his Name answered  'That she was indeed the unhappy Person he imagined her to be but added I wonder any one should know me in this Disguise'  To which the Serjeant replied  'he was very much surprized to see her Ladyship in such a Dress and was afraid some Accident had happened to her'  'An Accident hath happened to me indeed' says she 'and I am highly obliged to this Gentleman pointing to  Jones  that it was not a fatal one or that I am now living to mention it'  'Whatever the Gentleman hath done' cries the Serjeant 'I am sure the Captain will make him Amends for it and if I can be of any Service your Ladyship may command me and I shall think myself very happy to have it in my Power to serve your Ladyship and so indeed may any one for I know the Captain will well reward them for it'  The Landlady who heard from the Stairs all that past between the Serjeant and Mrs  Waters  came hastily down and running directly up to her began to ask Pardon for the Offences she had committed begging that all might be imputed to Ignorance of her Quality For  'Lud Madam' says she 'how should I have imagined that a Lady of your Fashion would appear in such a Dress I am sure Madam if I had once suspected that your Ladyship was your Ladyship I would sooner have burnt my Tongue out than have said what I have said And I hope your Ladyship will accept of a Gown till you can get your own Cloaths'  'Prithee Woman' says Mrs  Waters  'cease your Impertinence How can you imagine I should concern myself about any thing which comes from the Lips of such low Creatures as yourself But I am surprized at your Assurance in thinking after what is past that I will condescend to put on any of your dirty Things I would have you know Creature I have a Spirit above that'  Here  Jones  interfered and begg'd Mrs  Waters  to forgive the Landlady and to accept her Gown  'For I must confess' cries he 'our Appearance was a little suspicious when first we came in and I am well assured all this good Woman did was as she professed out of Regard to the Reputation of her House'  'Yes upon my truly was it' says she 'the Gentleman speaks very much like a Gentleman and I see very plainly is so and to be certain the House is well known to be a House of as good Reputation as any on the Road and tho' I say it is frequented by Gentry of the best Quality both  Irish  and  English  I defy any Body to say black is my Eye for that Matter And as I was saying if I had known your Ladyship to be your Ladyship I would as soon have burnt my Fingers as have affronted  your Ladyship but truly where Gentry come and spend their Money I am not willing that they should be scandalized by a Set of poor shabby Vermin that wherever they go leave more Lice than Money bebind them such Folks never raise my Compassion For to be certain it is foolish to have any for them and if our Justices did as they ought they would be all whipt out of the Kingdom for to be certain it is what is most fitting for them But as for your Ladyship I am heartily sorry your Ladyship hath had a Misfortune and if your Ladyship will do me the Honour to wear my Cloaths till you can get some of your Ladyship's own to be certain the best I have is at your Ladyship's Service'  Whether Cold Shame or the Persuasions of Mr  Jones  prevailed most with Mrs  Waters  I will not determine but she suffered herself to be pacified by this Speech of my Landlady and retired with that good Woman in order to apparel herself in a decent Manner  My Landlord was likewise beginning his Oration to  Jones  but was presently interrupted by that generous Youth who shook him heartily by the Hand and assured him of entire Forgiveness saying  'If you are satisfied my worthy Friend I promise you I am'  and indeed in one Sense the Landlord had the better Reason to be satisfied for he had received a Bellyfull of Drubbing whereas  Jones  had scarce felt a single Blow  Partridge  who had been all this Time washing his bloody Nose at the Pump returned into the Kitchen at the Instant when his Master and the Landlord were shaking Hands with each other As he was of a peaceable Disposition he was pleased with those Symptoms of Reconciliation and tho' his Face bore some Marks of  Susan  's Fist and many more of her Nails he rather chose to be contented with his Fortune  in the last Battle than to endeavour at bettering it in another  The heroic  Susan  was likewise well contented with her Victory tho' it had cost her a BlackEye which  Partridge  had given her at the first Onset Between these two therefore a League was struck and those Hands which had been the Instruments of War became now the Mediators of Peace  Matters were thus restored to a perfect Calm at which the Serjeant tho' it may seem so contrary to the Principles of his Profession testified his Approbation  'Why now that's friendly said he Dn me I hate to see two People bear Illwill to one another after they have had a Tussel The only Way when Friends quarrel is to see it out fairly in a friendly Manner as a Man may call it either with Fist or Sword or Pistol according as they like and then let it be all over For my own Part dn me if ever I love my Friend better than when I am fighting with him To bear Malice is more like a  Frenchman  than an  Englishman  '  He then proposed a Libation as a necessary Part of the Ceremony at all Treaties of that Kind Perhaps the Reader may here conclude that he was well versed  n antient History but this tho' highly probable as he cited no Authority to support the Custom I will not affirm with any Confidence Most likely indeed it is that he founded his Opinion on very good Authority since he confirmed it with many violent Oaths  Jones  no sooner heard the Proposal than immediately agreeing with the learned Serjeant he ordered a Bowl or rather a large Mug filled with the Liquor used on these Occasions to be brought in and then began the Ceremony himself He placed his Right Hand in that of the Landlord and seizing the Bowl with his Left uttered the usual Words and then made his Libation After which the same was observed by  all present Indeed there is very little Need of bein  particular in describing the whole Form as it differe  so little from those Libations of which so much is re+corded in ancient Authors and their modern Tran+scribers The principal Difference lay in two Instan+ces For first the present Company poured the Li+quor only down their Throats and dly The Se  +jeant who officiated as Priest drank the last but h  preserved I believe that ancient Form in swallowing much the largest Draught of the whole Company an  in being the only Person present who contributed no+thing towards the Libation besides his good Offic  in assisting at the Performance  The good People now ranged themselves roun  the Kitchen Fire where good Humour seemed  maintain an absolute Dominion and  Partridge  n  only forgot his shameful Defeat but converted Hun+ger into Thirst and soon became extremely facetiou  We must however quit this agreeable Assembly fo  while and attend Mr  Jones  to Mrs  Waters'  Apartment where the Dinner which he had bespok  was now on the Table Indeed it took no loo  Time in preparing having been all drest three Day before and required nothing more from the Cook tha  to warm it over again  CHAP V  An Apology for all Heroes who have good Stomach▪ with a Description of a Battle of the amorous Kind  HEROES notwithstanding the high Ideas which by the Means of Flatterers they may en+tertain of themselves or the World may conceive o  them have certainly more of mortal than divine about them However elevated their Minds may be thei  Bodies at least which is much the major Part of most are liable to the worst Infirmities and subject to th  vilest Offices of human Nature Among these latter the Act of Eating which hath by several wise Men been considered as extremely mean and derogatory from the Philosophic Dignity must be in some Measure performed by the greatest Prince Heroe or Philosopher upon Earth nay sometimes Nature hath been so Frolicksome as to exact of these dignified Characters a much more exorbitant Share of this Office than she hath obliged those of the lowest Order to perform  To say the Truth as no known Inhabitant of this Globe is really more than Man so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the Necessities of Man demand but when those great Personages I have just mentioned condescend to aim at confining such low Offices to themselves as when by hoarding or destroying they seem desirous to prevent any others from eating they then surely become very low and despicable  Now after this short Preface we think it no Disparagement to our Heroe to mention the immoderate Ardour with which he laid about him at this Season Indeed it may be doubted whether  Ulysses  who by the Way seems to have had the best Stomach of all the Heroes in that eating Poem of the Odyssey ever made a better Meal Three Pounds at least of that Flesh which formerly had contributed to the Composition of an Ox was now honoured with becoming Part of the individual Mr  Jones  This Particular we thought ourselves obliged to mention as it may account for our Heroe's temporary Neglect of his fair Companion who eat but very little and was indeed employed in considerations of a very different Nature which passed unobserved by  Jones  till he had entirely satisfied that Appetite which a Fast of twentyfour Hours had procured him but  his Dinner was no sooner ended than his Attention to other Matters revived with these Matters therefore we shall now proceed to acquaint the Reader  Mr  Jones  of whose personal Accomplishment  we have hitherto said very little was in reality one of the handsomest young Fellows in the World Hi  Face besides being the Picture of Health had in i  the most apparent Marks of Sweetness and Goodna+ture These Qualities were indeed so characteristica  in his Countenance that while the Spirit and Sensibility in his Eyes tho' they must have been perceived by an accurate Observer might have escaped the Notice of the less discerning so strongly was this Goodnature painted in his Look that it was remarked by almost every one who saw him  It was perhaps as much owing to this as to a very fine Complection that his Face had a Delicacy in it almost inexpressible and which might have given him an Air rather too effeminate had it not been joined to a most masculine Person and Mein which latter had as much in them of the  Hercules  as the former had of the  Adonis  He was besides active genteel gay and good humoured and had a Flow o  Animal Spirits which enlivened every Conversation where he was present  When the Reader hath duly reflected on these many Charms which all centered in our Heroe and considers at the same Time the fresh Obligations which Mrs  Waters  had to him it will be a Mark of more Prudery than Candour to entertain a bad Opinion o  her because she conceived a very good Opinion o  him  But whatever Censures may be passed upon her i  is my Business to relate Matters of Fact with Veracity Mrs  Waters  had in Truth not only a good Opinion of our Heroe but a very great Affection for him To speak out boldly at once she was in Love according to the present universally received Sense o  at Phrase by which Love is applied indiscriminate  to the desirable Objects of all our Passions Appe  es and Senses and is understood to be that Prefe  ence which we give to one Kind of Food rather than  another  But tho' the Love to these several Objects may pos  bly be one and the same in all Cases its Operations  owever must be allowed to be different for how  uch soever we may be in Love with an excellent  urloin of Beef or Bottle of  Burgundy  with a Da  ask Rose or  Cremona  Fiddle yet do we never  ile nor ogle nor dress nor flatter nor endeaour by any other Arts or Tricks to gain the Affection  the said Beef  c  Sigh indeed we sometimes may  ut it is generally in the Absence not in the Presence  the beloved Object For otherwise we might possibly  omplain of their Ingratitude and Deafness with the  me Reason as  Pasiphae  doth of her Bull whom she  ndeavoured to engage by all the Coquetry practised  ith good Success in the Drawing Room on the  uch more sensible as well as tender Hearts of the  ne Gentlemen there  The contrary happens in that Love which ope  tes between Persons of the same Species but of  fferent Sexes Here we are no sooner in Love  an it becomes our principal Care to engage the Af  ction of the Object beloved For what other Pur  ose indeed are our Youth instructed in all the Arts  rendering themselves agreeable If it was not with View to this Love I question whether any of those  rades which deal in setting off and adorning the  uman Person would procure a Livelihood Nay  ose great Polishers of our Manners who are by  me thought to teach what principally distinguishes  from the Brute Creation even DancingMasters  emselves might possibly find no Place in Society  short all the Graces which young Ladies and  young Gentlemen too learn from others and the many Improvements which by the help of a Looking Glass they add of their own are in Reality those very  Spicula Faces Amoris  so often mentioned by  Ovid  or as they are sometimes called in our own Language  the whole Artillery of Love  Now Mrs  Watres  and our Heroe had no sooner sat down together than the former began to play this Artillery upon the latter But here as we are about to attempt a Description hitherto unessayed either in Prose or Verse we think proper to invoke the Assistance of certain Aerial Beings who will we doubt not come kindly to our Aid on this Occasion  'Say then you Graces you that inhabit the heavenly Mansions of  Seraphina  's Countenance for you are truly Divine are always in her Presence and well know all the Arts of charming say what were the Weapons now used to captivate the Heart of Mr  Jones  '  'First from two lovely blue Eyes whose bright Orbs flashed Lightning at their Discharge flew forth two pointed Ogles But happily for our Heroe hit only a vast Piece of Beef which he was then conveying into his Plate and harmless spen  their Force The fair Warrior perceived their Miscarriage and immediately from her fair Bosom drew forth a deadly Sigh A Sigh which none could have heard unmoved and which was sufficient at once to have swept off a dozen Beaus so soft so sweet so tender that the insinuating Air must have found its subtle Way to the Heart of our Heroe had it no  luckily been driven from his Ears by the coarse Bubbling of some bottled Ale which at that Time he was pouring forth Many other Weapons did she assay but the God of Eating if there be any such Deity for I do not confidently assert it preserved' his Votary or perhaps it may not be  Dignus  vindice nodus  and the present Security of  Jones  may be accounted for by natural Means For as Love frequently preserves from the Attacks of Hunger so may Hunger possibly in some Cases defend us against Love'  'The Fair One enraged at her frequent Disappointments determined on a short Cessation of Arms Which Interval she employed in making ready every Engine of Amorous Warfare for the renewing of the Attack when Dinner should be over'  'No sooner then was the Cloth removed than she again began her Operations First having planted her Right Eye sideways against Mr  Jones  she shot from its Corner a most penetrating Glance which tho' great Part of its Force was spent before it reached our Heroe did not vent itself absolutely without Effect This the Fair One perceiving hastily withdrew her Eyes and leveled them downwards as if she was concerned for what she had done Tho' by this Means she designed only to draw him from his Guard and indeed to open his Eyes through which she intended to surprize his Heart And now gently lifting up those two bright Orbs which had already begun to make an Impression on poor  Jones  she discharged a Volicy of small Charms at once from her whole Countenance in a Smile Not a Smile of Mirth nor of Joy but a Smile of Affection which most Ladies have always ready at their Command and which serves them to shew at once their GoodHumour their pretty Dimples and their white Teeth'  'This Smile our Heroe received full in his Eyes and was immediately staggered with its Force He then began to see the Designs of the Enemy and indeed to feel their Success A Parley now was set on Foot between the Parties during which the  artful Fair so slily and imperceptibly carried on he  Attack that she had almost subdued the Heart o  our Heroe before she again repaired to Acts o  Hostility To confess the Truth I am afraid Mr  Jones  maintained a Kind of  Dutch  Defence and treacherously delivered up the Garrison with out duly weighing his Allegiance to the fair  Sophia  In short no sooner had the amorous Parley ended and the Lady had unmasked the Royal Battery by carelessly letting her Handherchief drop from he  Neck than the Heart of Mr  Jones  was entirely taken and the fair Conqueror enjoyed the usual Fruits of her Victory'  Here the Graces think proper to end their Descrip+tion and here we think proper to end the Chap+ter  CHAP VI  A friendly Conversation in the Kitche which had very common tho' not friendly Conclusion  WHILE our Lovers were entertaining them+selves in the Manner which is partly described in the foregoing Chapter they were likewise furnish+ing out an entertainment for their good Friends in the Kitchen And this in a double Sense by affording them Matter for their Conversation and at the same Time Drink to enliven their Spirits  There were now assembled round the Kitchen Fire besides my Landlord and Landlady who occasionally went backward and forward Mr  Partridge  th  Serjeant and the Coachman who drove the young Lady and her Maid  Partridge  having acquainted the Company with what he had learnt from the Man of the Hill con+cerning the Situation in which Mrs  Waters  had been found by  Jones  the Serjeant proceeded to that Par  of her History which was known to him He said  she was the Wife of Mr  Waters  who was a Captain  n their Regiment and had often been with him at Quarters  'Some Folks' says he 'used indeed to doubt whether they were lawfully married in a Church or no But for my Part that's no Business of mine I must own if I was put to my Corporal Oath I believe she is little better than one of us and I fancy the Captain may go to Heaven when the Sun shines upon a rainy Day But if he does that is neither here nor there for he won't want Company And the Lady to give the Devil his Due is a very good Sort of Lady and loves the Cloth and is always desirous to do strict Justice to it for she hath begged off many a poor Soldier and by her Goodwill would never have any of them punished But yet to be sure Ensign  Northerton  and she were very well acquainted together at our last Quarters that is the very Right and Truth of the Matter But the Captain he knows nothing about it and as long as there is enough for him too what does it signify He loves her not a bit the worse and I am certain would run any Man through the Body that was to abuse her therefore I don't abuse her for my Part I only repeat what other Folks say and to be certain what every body says there must be some Truth in'  'Ay ay a great deal of Truth I warrant you' cries  Partridge 'Veritas odium parit'  'All a Parcel of scandalous Stuff' answered the Mis  ess of the House 'I am sure now she is drest she looks like a very good Sort of Lady and she behaves herself like one for she gave me a Guinea for the Use of my Cloaths'  'A very good Lady indeed' cries my Landlord 'and if you had not been a little too hasty you would not have quarrelled with her as you did at first'  'You need mention that with my truly' answered she 'if it had not been for your Nonsense nothing had happened You must be meddling with what did not belong to  you and throw in your Fool's Discourse'  'Well well' answered he 'what's past cannot be mended so there's an End of the Matter'  'Yes' cries she 'for this once but will it be mended ever the more hereafter This is not the first Time I have suffered for your Numscull's Pate I wish you would always hold your Tongue in the House and meddle only in Matters without Doors which concern you Don't you remember what happened about seven Years ago    'Nay my Dear' returned he 'don'  rip up old Stories Come come all's well and I am sorry for what I have done'  The Landlady was going to reply but was prevented by the Peace▪ making Serjeant sorely to the Displeasure of  Partridge  who was a great Lover of what is called Fun and a great Promoter of those harmless Quarrels which tend rather to the Production of comical than tragical In+cidents  The Serjeant asked  Partridge  whither he and hi  Master were travelling  'None of your Magisters answered  Partridge  'I am no Man's Servant  assure you for tho' I have had Misfortunes in th  World I write Gentleman after my Name an  as poor and as simple as I may appear now I have taught Grammar School in my Time  Sed he  mihi non sum quod fui'  'No Offence I hope Sir' said the Serjeant 'where then if I ma  venture to be so bold may you and your Frien  be travelling'    'You have now denominated u  right' says  Partridge 'Amici Sumus  And  promise you my Friend is one of the greatest Gen+tlemen in the Kingdom'  at which Words bo  Landlord and Landlady pricked up their Ears  'He is the Heir of Squire  Allworthy'  'What th  Squire who doth so much Good all over the Coun+try'  cries my Landlady  'Even he'  answere  Partridge  'Then I warrant' says she 'he'll ha  'a swinging great Estate hereafter'  Most certainly  answered  Partridge  Well' replied the Landlady 'I thought the first Moment I saw him he looked like a good Sort of Gentleman but my Husband here to be sure is wiser than any body'  'I own my Dear' cries he 'it was a Mistake'  'A Mistake indeed' answered she 'but when did you ever know me to make such Mistakes'    But how comes it Sir' cries the Landlord 'that such a great Gentleman walks about the Country afoot'  'I don't know' returned  Partridge  'great Gentlemen have Humours sometimes He hath now a dozen Horses and Servants at  Gloucester  and nothing would serve him but last Night it being very hot Weather he must cool himself with a Walk to yon high Hill whither I likewise walked with him to bear him Company but if ever you catch me there again For I was never so frightened in all my Life We met with the strangest Man there'  'I'll be hanged' cries the Landlord 'if it was not the Man of the Hill as they call him if indeed he be a Man but I know several People who believe it is the Devil that lives there'  'Nay nay like enough' says  Partridge  'and now you put me in the Head of it I verily and sincerely believe it was the Devil tho' I could not perceive his cloven Foot but perhaps he might have the Power given him to hide that since evil Spirits can appear in what Shapes they please'  'And pray Sir' says the Serjeant 'no Offence I hope but pray what Sort of a Gentleman is the Devil For I have heard some of our Officers say There is no such Person and that it is only a Trick of the Parsons to prevent their being broke for if it was publickly known that there was no Devil the Parsons would be of no more Use than we are in Time of Peace'  Those Officers' says  Partridge'  'are very great Scholars I suppose'  'Not much of Schollards neither' answered the Serjeant 'they have not  half your Learning Sir I believe and to be sure I thought there must be a Devil notwithstanding what they said tho' one of them was a Captain for methought thinks I to my self if there be no Devil how can wicked People be sent to him and I have read all that upon a Book'  'Some of your Officers' quoth the Landlord 'will find there is a Devil to their Shame I believe I don't question but he'll pay off some old Scores upon my Account Here was one quartered upon me half a Year who had the Conscience to take up one of my best Beds tho' he hardly spent a Shilling a Day in the House and suffered his Men to roast Cabbages at the Kitchen Fire because I would not give them a Dinner on a  Sunday  Every good Christian must desire there should be a Devil for the Punishment of such Wretches'  'Harkee Landlord' said the Serjeant 'don't abuse the Cloth for I won't take it'  Dn the Cloth' answered the Landlord 'I have suffered enough by them  'Bear Witness Gentlemen' says the Serjeant 'he curses the King and that's High Treason'  'I curse the King you Villain'  said the Landlord  'Yes you did' cries the Serjeant 'you cursed the Cloth and that's cursing the King It's all one and the same for every Man who curses the Cloth would curse the King if he durst so for Matter o' that it's all one and the same Thing'  Excuse me there Mr Serjeant' quoth  Partridge  'that's a  Non Sequitur'  'None of your outlandish Lingo' answered the Seajeant leaping from his Seat 'I will not sit still and hear the Cloth abused'    'You mistake me Friend' cries  Partridge  'I did not mean to abuse the Cloth I only said your Conclusion was a  Non Sequitur'  This Word which the Serjeant unhappily mistook for an Affront is a Term in Logic and means that the Conclusion doth not follow from the Premises  '  'You are another'  cries the Serjeant 'an you come to that No more a  Sequitur  than yourself You are a Pack of Rascals and I'll prove it for I will fight the best Man of you all for twenty Pound'  This Challenge effectually silenced  Partridge  whose Stomach for drubbing did not so soon return after the hearty Meal which he had lately been treated with but the Coachman whose Bones were less sore and whose Appetite for Fighting was somewhat sharper did not so easily brook the Affront of which he conceived some Part at least fell to his Share He started therefore from his Seat and advancing to the Serjeant swore he looked on himself to be as good a Man as any in the Army and offered to box for a Guinea The military Man accepted the Combat but refused the Wager upon which both immediately stript and engaged till the Driver of Horses was so well mauled by the Leader of Men that he was obliged to exhaust his small Remainder of Breath in begging for Quarter  The young Lady was now desirous to depart and had given Orders for her Coach to be prepared but all in vain for the Coachman was disabled from performing his Office for that Evening An antient Heathen would perhaps have imputed this Disability to the God of Drink no less than to the God of War for in Reality both the Combatants had sacrificed as well to the former Deity as to the latter To speak plainly they were both dead drunk nor was  Partridge  in a much better Situation As for my Landlord drinking was his Trade and the Liquor had no more Effect on him than it had on any other Vessel in his House  The Mistress of the Inn being summoned to attend Mr  Jones  and his Companion at their Tea gave a full Relation of the latter Part of the foregoing Scene  and at the same Time expressed great Concern for the young Lady 'who' she said' was under the utmost Uneasiness at being prevented from pursuing her Journey  'She is a sweet pretty Creature' added she 'and I am certain I have seen her Face before I fancy she is in Love and running away from her Friends Who knows but some young Gentleman or other may be expecting her with a Heart as heavy as her own'  Jones  fetched a hearty Sigh at those Words of which tho' Mrs  Waters  observed it she took no Notice while the Landlady continued in the Room but after the Departure of that good Woman she could not forbear giving our Heroe certain Hints of her suspecting some very dangerous Rival in his Affections The aukward Behaviour of Mr  Jones  on this Occasion convinced her of the Truth without his giving her a direct Answer to any of her Questions but she was not nice enough in her Amours to be greatly concerned at the Discovery The Beauty of  Jones  highly charmed her Eye but as she could not see his Heart she gave herself no concern about it She could feast heartily at the Table of Love without reflecting that some other already had been or hereafter might be feasted with the same Repast A Sentiment which if it deals but little in Refinement deals however much in Substance and is less capricious and perhaps less illnatured and selfish than the Desires of those Females who can be contented enough to abstain from the Possession of their Lovers provided they are sufficiently satisfied that no one else possesses them  CHAP VII  Containing a fuller Account of Mrs  Waters  and by what Means she came into that distressful Situation from which she was rescued by  Jones  THOUGH Nature hath by no Means mixed up an equal Share either of Curiosity or Vanity in every human Composition there is perhaps no Individual to whom she hath not allotted such a Proportion of both as requires much Art and Pains too to subdue and keep under A Conquest however absolutely necessary to every one who would in any Degree deserve the Characters of Wisdom or GoodBreeding  As  Jones  therefore might very justly be called a wellbred Man he had stifled all that Curiosity which the extraordinary Manner in which he had found Mrs  Waters  must be supposed to have occasioned He had indeed at first thrown out some few Hints to the Lady but when he perceived her industriously avoiding any Explanation he was contented to remain in Ignorance the rather as he was not without Suspicion that there were some Circumstances which must have raised her Blushes had she related the whole Truth  Now since it is possible that some of our Readers may not so easily acquiesce under the same Ignorance and as we are very desirous to satisfy them all we have taken uncommon Pains to inform ourselves of the real Fact with the Relation of which we shall conclude this Book  This Lady then had lived some Years with one Captain  Waters  who was a Captain in the same Regiment to which Mr  Northerton  belonged She past for that Gentleman's Wife and went by his Name and yet as the Serjeant said there were  some Doubts concerning the Reality of their Marriage which we shall not at present take upon us to resolve  Mrs  Waters  I am sorry to say it had for some Time contracted an Intimacy with the above mentioned Ensign which did no great Credit to her Reputation That she had a remakable Fondness for that young Fellow is most certain but whether she indulged this to any very criminal Lengths is not so extremely clear unless we will suppose that Women never grant every Favour to a Man but one without granting him that one also  The Division of the Regiment to which Captain  Waters  belonged had two Days preceded the March of that Company to which Mr  Northerton  was the Ensign so that the former had reached  Worcester  the very Day after the unfortunate Rencounter between  Jones  and  Northerton  which we have before recorded  Now it had been agreed between Mrs  Waters  and the Captain that she should accompany him in his March as far as  Worcester  where they were to take their Leave of each other and she was thence to return to  Bath  where she was to stay till the End of the Winter's Campaign against the Rebels  With this Agreement Mr  Northerton  was made acquainted To say the Truth the Lady had made him an Assignation at this very Place and promised to stay at  Worcester  till his Division came thither with what View and for that Purpose must be left to the Reader's Divination For though we are obliged to relate Facts we are not obliged to do a Violence to our Nature by any Comments to the Disadvantage of the loveliest Part of the Creation  Northerton  no sooner obtained a Release from his Captivity as we have seen than he hasted away to overtake Mrs  Waters  which as he was a very active  nimble Fellow he did at the last mentioned City some few Hours after Captain  Waters  had left her At his first Arrival he made no scruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate Accident which he made appear very unfortunate indeed For he totally extracted every Particle of what could be called Fault at least in a Court of Honour though he left some Circumstances which might be questionable in a Court of Law  Women to their Glory be it spoken are more generally capable of that violent and apparently disinterested Passion of Love which seeks only the Good of its Object than Men Mrs  Waters  therefore was no sooner apprized of the Danger to which her Lover was exposed than she lost every Consideration besides that of his Safety and this being a Matter equally agreeable to the Gentleman it became the immediate Subject of Debate between them  After much Consultation on this Matter it was at length agreed that the Ensign should go across the Country to  Hereford  whence he might find some Conveyance to one of the SeaPorts in  Wales  and thence might make his Escape abroad In all which Expedition Mrs  Waters  declared she would bear him Company and for which she was able to furnish him with Money a very material Article to Mr  Northerton  she having then in her Pocket three Bank Notes to the Amount of  l  besides some Cash and a Diamond Ring of pretty considerable Value on her Finger All which she with the utmost Confidence revealed to this wicked Man little suspecting she should by these Means inspire him with a Design of robbing her Now as they must by taking Horses from  Worcester  have furnished any Pursuers with the Means of hereafter discovering their Rout the Ensign proposed and the Lady presently agreed to make their first Stage on Foot for which Purpose the Hardness of the Frost was very seasonable  The main Part of the Lady's Baggage was already at  Bath  and she had nothing with her at present besides a very small Quantity of Linnen which the Gallant undertook to carry in his own Pockets All Things therefore being settled in the Evening they arose early the next Morning and at Five o'Clock departed from  Worcester  it being then above two Hours before Day But the Moon which was then at the full gave them all the Light she was capable of affording  Mrs  Waters  was not of that delicate Race of Women who are obliged to the Invention of Vehicles for the Capacity of removing themselves from one Place to another and with whom consequently a Coach is reckoned among the Necessaries of Life Her Limbs were indeed full of Strength and Agility and as her Mind was no less animated with Spirit she was perfectly able to keep Pace with her nimble Lover  Having travelled on for some Miles in a High Road which  Northerton  said he was informed led to  Hereford  they came at the Break of Day to the Side of a large Wood where he suddenly stopped and affecting to meditate a Moment with himself expressed some Apprehensions from travelling any longer in so public a Way Upon which he easily persuaded his fair Companion to strike with him into a Path which seemed to lead directly through the Wood and which at length brought them both to the Bottom of  MazardHill  Whether the execrable Scheme which he now attempted to execute was the Effect of previous Deliberation or whether it now first came into his Head I cannot determine But being arrived in this lonely Place where it was very improbable he should meet with any Interruption he suddenly slipped his Garter from his Leg and laying violent Hands on the poor Woman endeavoured to perpetrate that  dreadful and detestable Fact which we have before commemorated and which the providential Appearance of  Jones  did so fortunately prevent  Happy was it for Mrs  Waters  that she was not of the weakest Order of Females for no sooner did she perceive by his tying a Knot in his Garter and by his Declarations what his Hellish Intentions were than she stood stoutly to her Defence and so strongly struggled with her Enemy screaming all the while for Assistance that she delayed the Execution of the Villain's Purpose several Minutes by which Means Mr  Jones  came to her Relief at that very Instant when her Strength failed and she was totally overpowered and delivered her from the Ruffian's Hands with no other Loss than that of her Cloaths which were torn from her Back and of the Diamond Ring which during the Contention either dropped from her Finger or was wrenched from it by  Northerton  Thus Reader we have given thee the Fruits of a very painful Enquiry which for thy Satisfaction we have made into this Matter And here we have opened to thee a Scene of Folly as well as Villainy which we could scarce have believed a human Creature capable of being guilty of had we not remembered that this Fellow was at that Time firmly persuaded that he had already committed a Murther and had forfeited his Life to the Law As he concluded therefore that his only Safety lay in Flight he thought the possessing himself of this poor Woman's Money and Ring would make him Amends for the additional Burthen he was to lay on his Conscience  And here Reader we must strictly caution thee that thou dost not take any Occasion from the Misbehaviour of such a Wretch as this to reflect on so worthy and honourable a Body of Men as are the Officers of our Army in general Thou wilt be  pleased to consider that this Fellow as we have already informed thee had neither the Birth nor Education of a Gentleman nor was a proper Person to be enrolled among the Number of such If therefore his Baseness can justly reflect on any besides himself it must be only on those who gave him his Commission  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK X  In which the History goes forward about Twelve Hours  CHAP I  Containing Instructions very necessary to be perused by modern Critics  READER it is impossible we should know what Sort of Person thou wilt be For perhaps thou may'st be as learned in Human Nature as  Shakespear  himself was and perhaps thou may'st be no wiser than some of his Editors Now lest this latter should be the Case we think proper before we go any farther together to give thee a few wholesome Admonitions that thou may'st not as grosly misunderstand and misrepresent us as some of the said Editors have misunderstood and misrepresented their Author  First then we warn the not too hastily to condemn any of the Incidents in this our History as impertinent  and foreign to our main Design because thou dost not immediately conceive in what Manner such Incident may conduce to that Design This Work may indeed be considered as a great Creation of our own and for a little Reptile of a Critic to presume to find Fault with any of its Parts without knowing the Manner in which the Whole is connected and before he comes to the final Catastrophe is a most presumptuous Absurdity The Allusion and Metaphor we have here made use of we must acknowledge to be infinitely too great for our Occasion but there is indeed no other which is at all adequate to express the Difference between an Author of the first Rate and a Critic of the lowest  Another Caution we must give thee my good Reptile is that thou dost not find out too near a Resemblance between certain Characters here introduced as for instance between the Landlady who appears in the Seventh Book and her in the Ninth Thou art to know Friend that there are certain Characteristics in which most Individuals of every Profession and Occupation agree To be able to preserve these Characteristics and at the same Time to diversity their Operations is one Talent of a good Writer Again to mark the nice Distinction between two Persons actuated by the same Vice or Folly is another and as this last Talent is found in very few Writers so is the true Discernment of it found in as few Readers though I believe the Observation of this forms a very principal Pleasure in those who are capable of the Discovery Every Person for Instance can distinguish between Sir  Epicure Mammon  and Sir  Fopling Flutter  but to know the Difference between Sir  Fopling Flutter  and Sir  Courtly Nice  requires a more exquisite Judgment For want of which vulgar Spectators of Plays very often do great Injustice in the Theatre where I have sometimes known a Poet in Danger of being convicted as a Thief upon much  worse Evidence than the Resemblance of Hands hath been held to be in the Law In reality I apprehend every amorous Widow on the Stage would run the Hazard of being condemned as a servile Imitation of  Dido  but that happily very few of our Playhouse Critics understand enough of  Latin  to read  Virgil  In the next place we must admonish thee my worthy Friend for perhaps thy Heart may be better than thy Head not to condemn a Character as a bad one because it is not perfectly a good one If thou dost delight in these models of Perfection there are Books enow written to gratify thy Taste but as we have not in the Course of our Conversation ever happened to meet with any such Person we have not chosen to introduce any such here To say the Truth I a little question whether mere Man ever arrived at this consummate Degree of Excellence as well as whether there hath ever existed a Monster bad enough to verify that  nulla virtute redemptum  A vitiis  Whose Vices are not allayed with a single Virtue  in  Juvenal  Nor do I indeed conceive the good Purposes served by inserting Characters of such angelic Perfection or such diabolical Depravity in any Work of Invention Since from contemplating either the Mind of Man is more likely to be overwhelmed with Sorrow and Shame than to draw any good Uses from such Patterns for in the former Instance he may be both concerned and ashamed to see a Pattern of Excellence in his Nature which he may reasonably despair of ever arriving at and in contemplating the latter he may be no less affected with those uneasy Sensations at seeing the Nature of which he is a Partaker degraded into so odious and detestable a Creature  In Fact if there be enough of Goodness in a Character to engage the Admiration and Affection of a welldisposed Mind though there should appear some of those little Blemishes  quas humana parum cavit natura  they will raise our Compassion rather than our Abhorrence Indeed nothing can be of more moral Use than the Imperfections which are seen in Examples of this Kind since such form a Kind of Surprize more apt to affect and dwell upon our Minds than the Faults of very vicious and wicked Persons The Foibles and Vices of Men in whom there is great Mixture of Good become more glaring Objects from the Virtues which contrast them and which shew their Deformity and when we find such Vices attended with their evil Consequence to our favourite Characters we are not only taught to shun them for our own Sake but to hate them for the Mischiefs they have already brought on those we love  And now my Friend having given you these few Admonitions we will if you please once more set forward with our History  CHAP II  Containing the Arrival of an  Irish  Gentleman with very extraordinary Adventures which ensued at the Inn  NOW the little trembling Hare whom the Dread of all her numerous Enemies and chiefly of that cunning cruel carnivorous Animal Man had confined all the Day to her Lurkingplace sports wantonly o'er the Lawns Now on some hollow Tree the Owl shrill Chorister of the Night hoots forth Notes which might Charm the Ears of some modern Conoisseurs in Music Now in the Imagination of the halfdrunk Clown as he staggars through the Churchyard or rather Charnalyard to his  Home Fear paints the bloody Hobgoblin Now Thieves and Ruffians are awake and honest Watchmen fast asleep In plain  English  it was now Midnight and the Company at the Inn as well those who have been already mentioned in this History as some others who arrived in the Evening were all in Bed  Susan  Chambermaid was now only stirring she being obliged to wash the Kitchen before she retired to the Arms of the fond expecting Ostler  In this Posture were Affairs at the Inn when a Gentleman arrived there Post He immediately alighted from his Horse and coming up to  Susan  enquired of her in a very abrupt and confused Manner being almost out of Breath with Eagerness whether there was any Lady in the House The Hour of Night and the Behaviour of the Man who stared very wildly all the Time a little surprized  Susan  so that she hesitated before she made any Answer Upon which the Gentleman with redoubled Eagerness begg'd her to give him a true Information saying he had lost his 'Wife and was come in Pursuit of her  'Upon my Shoul' cries he 'I have been near catching her already in two or three Places if I had not found her gone just as I came up with her'  'If she be in the House do carry me up in the Dark and shew her to me and if she be gone away before me do tell me which Way I shall go after her to meet her and upon my Shoul I will make you the richest poor Woman in the Nation'  He then pulled out a Handful of Guineas a Sight which would have bribed Persons of much greater Consequence than this poor Wench to much worse Purposes  Susan  from the Account she had received of Mrs  Waters  made not the least Doubt but that she was the very identical Stray whom the right owner pursued As she concluded therefore with great Appearance of Reason that she never could get Money in an honester  Way than by restoring a Wife to her Husband she made no Scruple of assuring the Gentleman that the Lady he wanted was then in the House and was presently afterward prevailed upon by very liberal Promises and some Earnest paid into her Hands to conduct him to the Bedchamber of Mrs  Waters  It hath been a Custom long established in the polite World and that upon very solid and substantial Reasons that a Husband shall never enter his Wife's Apartment without first knocking at the Door The many excellent Uses of this Custom need scarce be hinted to a Reader who hath any Knowledge of the World For by this Means the Lady hath Time to adjust herself or to remove any disagreeable Object out of the Way for there are some Situations in which nice and delicate Women would not be discovered by their Husbands  To say the Truth there are several Ceremonies instituted among the polished Part of Mankind which tho' they may to coarser Judgments appear as Matters of mere Form are found to have much of Substance in them by the more discerning and lucky would it have been had the Custom abovementioned been observed by our Gentleman in the present Instance Knock indeed he did at the Door but not with one of those gentle Raps which is usual on such Occasions On the contrary when he found the Door locked he flew at it with such Violence that the Lock immediately gave Way the Door burst open and he fell headlong into the Room  He had no sooner recovered his Legs than forth from the Bed upon his Legs likewise appearedwith Shame and Sorrow are we obliged to proceedour Heroe himself who with a menacing Voice demanded of the Gentleman who he was and what he meant by daring to burst open his Chamber in that outrageous Manner  The Gentleman at first thought he had committed a  istake and was going to ask Pardon and retreat when on a sudden as the Moon shone very bright  e cast his Eyes on Stays Gowns Petticoats Caps Ribbons Stockings Garters Shoes Clogs  c  ll which lay in a disordered Manner on the Floor All these operating on the natural Jealousy of his Temper so enraged him that he lost all Power of Speech and without returning any Answer to  Jones  e endeavoured to approach the Bed  Jones  immediately interposing a fierce Contention  rose which soon proceeded to Blows on both Sides And now Mrs  Waters  for we must confess she was  n the same Bed being I suppose awakened from  er Sleep and seeing two Men fighting in her Bedchamber began to scream in the most violent Manner crying out Murder Robbery and more frequently Rape which last some perhaps may wonder she should mention who do not consider that these Words of Exclamation are used by Ladies in a Fright as Fa la la ra da  c  are in Music only as the Vehicles of Sound and without any fixed Ideas  Next to the Lady's Chamber was deposited the Body of an  Irish  Gentleman who arrived too late at the Inn to have been mentioned before This Gentleman was one of those whom the  Irish  call a Calabalaro or Cavalier He was a younger Brother of a good Family and having no Fortune at Home was obliged to look abroad in order to get one For which Purpose he was proceeding to the  Bath  to try his Luck with Cards and the Women  This young Fellow lay in Bed reading one of Mrs  Behn  's Novels for he had been instructed by a Friend that he would find no more effectual Method of recommending himself to the Ladies than the improving his Understanding and filling his Mind with good Literature He no sooner therefore heard the violent  Uproar in the next Room than he leapt from hi  Bolster and taking his Sword in one Hand and th  Candle which burnt by him in the other he went directly to Mrs  Waters  's Chamber  If the Sight of another Man in his Shirt at first ad+ded some Shock to the Decency of the Lady it mad her presently Amends by considerably abating he Fears for no sooner had the Calabalaro enter'd th  Room than he cry'd out  'Mr  Fitzpatrick  wha  the Devil is the  Meaning  of this'  Upon which th  other immediately answered  'O Mr  Macklachlan  I am rejoiced you are hereThis Villain hath de+bauched my Wife and is got into Bed with her'What Wife cries  Macklachlan  do not know Mrs  Fitzpatrick  very well and don't I se  that the Lady whom the Gentleman who stand here in his Shirt is lying in Bed with is none o  her'  Fitzpatrick  now perceiving as well by the Glimps  he had of the Lady as by her Voice which might have been distinguished at a greater Distance than he now stood from her that he had made a very unfortunate Mistake began to ask many Pardons of the Lady and then turning to  Jones  he said  'I would have you take Notice I do not ask your Pardon for you have  bate  me for which I am resolved to have your Blood in the Morning'  Jones  treated this Menace with much Contempt and Mr  Macklachlan  answered  'Indeed Mr  Fitzpatrick  you may be ashamed of your ownself to disturb People at this Time of Night If all the People in the Inn were not asleep you would have awakened them as you have me The Gentleman has served you very rightly Upon my Conscience tho' I have no Wife if you had treated her so I would have cut your Throat'  Jones  was so confounded with his Fears for his Lady's Reputation that he knew neither what to say  or do but the Invention of Women is as hath been observed much readier than that of Men She recollected that there was a communication between her  hamber and that of Mr  Jones  relying therefore  n his Honour and her own Assurance she answered I know not what you mean Villains I am Wife to none of you Help Rape Murder Rape'And now the Landlady coming into the Room Mrs  Waters  fell upon her with the utmost Virulence  ying 'She thought herself in a sober Inn and not in a BawdyHouse but that a Set of Villains had broke into her Room with an Intent upon her Honour if not upon her Life and both she said were equally dear to her'  The Landlady now began to roar as loudly as the  oor Woman in Bed had done before She cry'd She was undone and that the Reputation of her House which was never blown upon before was utterly destroyed' Then turning to the Men she  ry'd 'What in the Devil's Name is the Reason of all this Disturbance in the Lady's Room'  Fitzpatrick  hanging down his Head repeated 'that he had committed a Mistake for which he heartily asked Pardon' and then retired with his Countryman  Jones  who was too ingenious to have missed  he Hint given him by his Fair One boldly asserted That he had run to her Assistance upon hearing the Door broke open with what Design he could not conceive unless of robbing the Lady which if they intended he said he had had the good Fortune to prevent "I never had a Robbery committed in my House since I have kept it' cries the Landlady I wou'd have you to know Sir I harbour no Highwaymen here I scorn the Word thof I say it None but honest good Gentlefolks are welcome to my House and I thank good Luck I have always had enow of such Customers indeed as many as I could entertain Here hath been my Lord'  and then she repeated over a Catalogue of Name and Titles many of which we might perhaps b  guilty of a Breach of Privilege by inserting  Jones  after much Patience at length interrupted her by making an Apology to Mrs  Waters  for hav+ing appeared before her in his Shirt assuring her  'That nothing but a Concern for her Safety coul  have prevailed on him to do it'  The Reader ma  inform himself of her Answer and indeed of h  whole Behaviour to the End of the Scene by consi+dering the Situation which she affected being that of modest Lady who was awakened out of her Slee  by three strange Men in her Chamber This was th  Part which she undertook to perform and indeed she executed it so well that none of our Theatric  Actresses could exceed her in any of their Perfor+mances either on or off the Stage  And hence I think we may very fairly draw a  Argument to prove how extremely natural Virtue i  to the Fair Sex For tho' there is not perhaps on  in ten thousand who is capable of making a good Act+ress and even among these we rarely see two wh  are equally able to personate the same Character y  this of Virtue they can all admirably well put on an  as well those Individuals who have it not as thos  who possess it can all act it to the utmost Degree o  Perfection  When the Men were all departed Mrs  Water  recovering from her Fear recovered likewise from her Anger and spoke in much gentler Accents to th  Landlady who did not so readily quit her Concern for the Reputation of the House in Favour of which she began again to number the many great Person  who had slept under her Roof but the Lady stopt he  short and having absolutely acquitted her of having had any Share in the past Disturbance begged to b  left to her Repose which she said she hoped to en+joy unmolested during the Remainder of the Night  Upon which the Landlady after much Civility and  any Curt'sies took her Leave  CHAP III  Dialogue between the Landlady and  Susan  the Chambermaid proper to be read by all Innkeepers and their Servants with the Arrival and affable Behaviour of a beautiful young Lady which may teach Persons of Condition how they may acquire the Love of the whole World  THE Landlady remembring that  Susan  had been the only Person out of Bed when the Door was  urst open resorted presently to her to enquire into  he first Occasion of the Disturbance as well as who  he strange Gentleman was and when and how he  ived  Susan  related the whole Story which the Reader  nows already varying the Truth only in some Circumstances as she saw convenient and totally concealing the Money which she had received But whereas her Mistress had in the Preface to her Enquiry spoken much in Compassion for the Fright which the Lady had been in concerning any intended Depredations on her Virtue  Susan  could not help endeavouring to quiet the Concern which her Mistress seemed to be under on that Account by swear  ng heartily she saw  Jones  leap out from her Bed  The Landlady fell into a violent Rage at these Words  'A likely Story truly' cried she 'that a Woman should cry out and endeavour to expose herself if that was the Case I desire to know what better Proof any Lady can give of her Virtue than her crying out which I believe twenty People can witness for her she did I beg Madam you would spread no such Scandal of any of my Guests For it will not only reflect on them but upon the House and I am sure no Vagabonds nor wicked beggarly People come here'  'Well' says  Susan  'then I must not believe my own Eyes'  'No indeed must you not always' answered her Mistress 'I would not have believed my own Eyes against such good Gentlefolks I have not had a better Supper ordered this half Year than they ordered last Night and so easy and good humoured were they that they found no Fault with my  Worcestershire  Perry which I sold them for  Champagne  and to be sure it is as well tasted and as wholesome as the best  Champagne  in the Kingdom otherwise I would scorn to give it 'em and they drank me two Bottles No no I will never believe any Harm of such sober good Sort of People'  Susan  being thus silenced her Mistress proceeded to other Matters  'And so you tell me' continued she 'That the strange Gentleman came Post and there is a Footman without with the Horses why then he is certainly some of your great Gentlefolks too Why did not you ask him whether he'd have any Supper I think he is in the other Gentleman's Room go up and ask whether he cal+led Perhaps he'll order something when he find any Body stirring in the House to dress it Now don't commit any of your usual Blunders by telling him the Fire's out and the Fowls alive And if he should order Mutton don't blab out that we have none The Butcher I know killed a Sheep just before I went to Bed and he never refuses to cut it up warm when I desire it Go remember there's all Sort of Mutton and Fowls go open the Door with  Gentlemen d'ye call  and if they say nothing ask what his Honour will be pleased to have for Supper Don't forget his Honour Go if you don't mind all these Matters better you'll never come to any Thing'  Susan  departed and soon returned with an Account that the two Gentlemen were got both into the sam  Bed  'Two Gentlemen' says the Landlady 'i  the same Bed that's impossible they are two errant Scrubs I warrant them and I believe young Squire  Allworthy  guessed right that the Fellow intended to rob her Ladyship For if he had broke open the Lady's Door with any of the wicked Designs of a Gentleman he would never have sneaked away to another Room to save the Expence of a Supper and a Bed to himself They are certainly Thieves and their searching after a Wife is nothing but a Pretence'  In these Censures my Landlady did Mr  Fitzpa  ick  great Injustice for he was really born a Gentleman though not worth a Groat and tho' perhaps  e had some few Blemishes in his Heart as well as  n his Head yet being a sneaking or a niggardly Fellow was not one of them In reality he was so generous a Man that whereas he had received a very  andsome Fortune with his Wife he had now spent every Penny of it except some little Pittance which was settled upon her and in order to possess himself  f this he had used her with such Cruelty that together with his Jealousy which was of the bitterest  ind it had forced the poor Woman to run away from him  This Gentleman then being well tired with his long  ourney from  Chester  in one Day with which and  ome good dry Blows he had received in the Scuffle  is Bones were so sore that added to the Soreness of  s Mind it had quite deprived him of any Appetite for eating And now being so violently disappointed  n the Woman whom at the Maid's Instance he had mistaken for his Wife it never once entered into  is Head that she might nevertheless be in the House though he had erred in the first Person he had attacked He therefore yielded to the Dissuasions of his Friend from searching any farther after her that Night and accepted the Kind offer of Part of his Bed  The Footman and Postboy were in a differ  Disposition They were more ready to order th  the Landlady was to provide however after bei  pretty well satisfied by them of the real Truth of  Case and that Mr  Fitzpatrick  was no Thief  was at length prevailed on to set some cold M  before them which they were devouring with gr  Greediness when  Partridge  came into the Kitch  He had been first awakened by the Hurry which  have before seen and while he was endeavouring compose himself again on his Pillow a ScreechO  had given him such a Serenade at his Window that leapt in a most horrible Affright from his Bed  huddling on his Cloaths with great Expedition  down to the Protection of the Company whom heard talking below in the Kitchen  His Arrival detained my Landlady from returni  to her Rest For she was just about to leave the ther two Guests to the Care of  Susan  but the Fri  of young Squire  Allworthy  was not to be so neglect especially as he called for a Pint of Wine to be  led She immediately obeyed by putting the sa  Quantity of Perry to the Fire For this readily swered to the Name of every Kind of Wine  The  Irish  Footman was retired to Bed and PostBoy was going to follow but  Partridge  vited him to stay and partake of his Wine which Lad very thankfully accepted The Schoolma  was indeed afraid to return to Bed by himself an  he did not know how soon he might lose the Co  +pany of my Landlady he was resolved to secure of the Boy in whose Presence he apprehended Danger from the Devil or any of his Adherents  And now arrived another PostBoy at the G  upon which  Susan  being ordered out returned troducing two young Women in Ridinghabits of which was so very richly laced that  Partridge  the Postboy instantly started from their Chairs and my Landlady fell to her Curt'sies and her Ladyships with great Eagerness  The Lady in the rich Habit said with a Smile of great Condescension 'If you will give me Leave Madam I will warm myself a few Minutes at your Kitchen Fire for it is really very cold but I must insist on disturbing no one from their Seats' This was spoken on Account of  Partridge  who had retreated to the other End of the Room struck with the utmost Awe and Astonishment at the Splendor of the Lady's dress Indeed she had a much better Title to Respect than this For she was one of the most beautiful Creatures in the World  The Lady earnestly desired  Partridge  to return to his Seat but could not prevail She then pulled off her Gloves and displayed two Hands which had every Property of Wax in them except that of melting to the Fire Her Companion who was indeed her Maid likewise pulled off her Gloves and discovered what bore an exact Resemblance in Cold and Colour  o a Piece of frozen Beef  'I wish Madam' quoth the latter 'your Ladyship would not think of going any farther to Night I am terribly afraid your Ladyship will not be able to bear the Fatigue  'Why sure' cries the Landlady' 'her Ladyship's Honour can never intend it O bless me farther to Night indeed Let me beseech your Ladyship not to think on'tBut to be sure your Ladyship can't What will your Honour be pleased to have for Supper I have Mutton of all Kinds and some nice Chicken'  'I think Madam' said the Lady 'it would be rather Breakfast than Supper but I can't eat any Thing and if I stay shall only lie down for an Hour or two However if you please Madam  you may get me a little SackWhey made very small and thin'  'Yes Madam' cries the Mistress of the House I have some excellent Whitewine 'You have no Sack then' says the Lady 'Yes an't please your Honour I have I may challange the Country for thatBut let me beg your Ladyship to eat something'  'Upon my Word I can't eat a Morsel' answerred the Lady 'and I shall be much obliged to you if you will please to get my Apartment ready as soon as possible For I am resolved to be o  Horseback again in three Hours'  'Why  Susan'  cries the Landlady 'is there a Fir  lit yet in the  Wildgoose  I am sorry Madam al  my Best Rooms are full Several People of th  first Quality are now in Bed Here's a great youn  Squire and a many other great Gentlefolks of Quality'  Susan  answered 'That the  Irish  Gentlemen wer  got into the  Wildgoose  '  'Was ever any Thing like it' says the Mistress 'why the Devil would you not keep some of the be  Rooms for the Quality when you know scarce Day passes without some calling hereIf they b  Gentlemen I am certain when they know it is fo  her Ladyship they will get up again'  'Not upon my Account' says the Lady 'I wi  have no Person disturbed for me If you have Room that is commonly decent it will serve n  very well though it be never so plain I beg Ma+dam you will not give yourself so much Troub  on my Account O' Madam' cries the other I have several very good Rooms for that Matte  but none good enough for your Honour's Ladyship However as you are so condescending to take u  with the best I have do  Susan  get a Fire in th  Rose  this Minute Will your Ladyship be please  to go up now or stay till the Fire is lighted I think I have sufficiently warmed myself' answered the Lady 'so if you please I will go now I am afraid I have kept People and particularly that Gentleman meaning  Partridge  too long in the Cold already Indeed I cannot bear to think of keeping any Person from the Fire this dreadful Weather'  She then departed with her Maid the Landlady marching with two lighted Candles before her  When that good Woman returned the Conversation in the Kitchen was all upon the Charms of the young Lady There is indeed in perfect Beauty a Power which none almost can withstand For my Landlady though she was not pleased at the Negative given to the Supper declared she had never seen so lovely a Creature  Partridge  ran out into the most extravagant Encomiums on her Face though he could not refrain from paying some Compliments to the Gold Lace on her Habit the Postboy sung forth the Praises of her Goodness which were likewise echoed by the other Postboy who was now come in  'She's a true good Lady I warrant her' says he For she hath Mercy upon dumb Creatures for she asked me every now and tan upon the Journey if I did not think she should hurt the Horses by riding too fast and when she came in she charged me to give them as much Corn as ever they would eat'  Such Charms are there in Affability and so sure is it to attract the Praises of all Kinds of People It may indeed be compared to the celebrated Mrs  Hussy  A celebrated Mantuamaker in the  Strand  famous for setting off the Shapes of Women  It is equally sure to set off every Female Perfection to the highest Advantage and to palliate and conceal every Defect A short Reflection which  we could not forbear making in this Place where my Reader hath seen the Loveliness of an affable Deportment and Truth will now oblige us to contrast it by shewing the Reverse  CHAP IV  Containing infallible Nostrums for procuring universal Disesteem and Hatred  THE Lady had no sooner laid herself on her Pillow than the Waitingwoman returned to the Kitchen to regale with some of those Dainties which her Mistress had refused  The Company at her Entrance shewed her the same Respect which they had before paid to her Mistress by rising but she forgot to imitate her by desiring them to sit down again Indeed it was scarce possible they should have done so For she placed her Chain in such a Posture as almost to occupy the whole Fire She then ordered a Chicken to be broiled that Instant declaring if it was not ready in a Quarter of an Hour she would not stay for it Now tho' the said Chicken was then at Roost in the stable and required the several Ceremonies of catching killing and picking before it was brought to the Gridiron my Landlady would nevertheless have undertaken to do all within the Time but the Guest being unfortunately admitted behind the Scenes must have been Witness to the  Fourberie  the poor Woman was therefore obliged to confess that she had none in the House but Madam said she  'I can get any kind of Mutton in an Instant from the Butcher's'  'Do you think then' answered the Waiting Gentlewoman 'that I have the Stomach of a Horse to eat Mutton at this Time of Night Sure you People that keep Inns imagine your Betters are like yourselves Indeed I expected to get nothing at this wretched place I wonder my Lady would  stop at it I suppose none but Tradesmen and Grasiers ever call here'  The Landlady fired at  is Indignity offered to her House however she supressed her Temper and contented herself with saying  'Very good Quality frequented it she thanked Heaven'  Don't tell me' cries the other 'of Quality I believe I know more of People of Quality than such as youBut prithee without troubling me with any of your Impertinence do tell me what I can have for Supper for tho' I connot eat Horseflesh I am really hungry'  'Why truly Madam' answered the Landlady 'you could not have taken me again at such a Disadvantage For I must confess I have nothing in the House unless a cold Piece of Beef which indeed a Gentlewoman's Footman and the Postboy have almost cleared to the Bone'  Woman said Mrs  Abigail  so for Shortness we will call her I intreat you not to make me sick If I had fasted a Month I could not eat what had been touched by the Fingers of such Fellows Is there nothing neat or decent to be had in this horrid Place'  'What think you of some Eggs and Bacon Madam' said the Landlady 'Are your Eggs new laid Are you certain they were laid Today And let me have the Bacon cut very nice and thin for I can't endure any Thing that's grossPrithee try if you can do a little tolerably for once and don't think you have a Farmer's Wife or some of those Creatures in the House'  The Landlady begun then to handle her Knife but the other stopt her saying  'Good Woman I must insist upon your first washing your Hands for I am extremely nice and have been always used from my Cradle to have every thing in the most elegant Manner'  The Landlady who governed herself with much Difficulty began now the necessary Preprerations for as to  Susan  she was utterly rejected and with  such Disdain that the poor Wench was as hard put to it to restrain her Hands from Violence as her Mistress had been to hold her Tongue This indeed  Susan  did not entirely For tho' she literally kept it within her Teeth yet there it muttered many  'marrycomeups as good Flesh and Blood as yourself with other such indignant Phrases'  While the Supper was preparing Mrs  Abigail  began to lament she had not ordered a Fire in the Parlour but she said that was now too late  'However said she 'I have Novelty to recommend a Kitchen for I do not believe I ever eat in one before'  Then turning to the PostBoys she asked them  'Why they were not in the Stable with their Horses If I must eat my hard Fare here Madam'  cries she to the Landlady  'I beg the Kitchen may be kept clear that I may not be surrounded with all the Blackguards in Town as for you Sir' says she to  Partridge  'you look somewhat like a Gentleman and may sit still if you please I don't desire to disturb any body but Mob'  'Yes yes Madam cries  Partridge  'I am a Gentleman I do assure you and I am not so easily to be disturbed  Non semper vox causalis est verbo nominativus  '  This  Latin  she took to be some Affront and answered  'You may be a Gentleman Sir but you don't shew yourself as one to talk  Latin  to a Wonan'  Partridge  made a genteel Reply and concluded with more  Latin  upon which she tossed up her Nose and contented herself by abusing him with the Name of a great Scholar  The Supper being now on the Table Mrs  Abigail  eat very heartily for so delicate a Person and while a second Course of the same was by her Order preparing she said  'And so Madam you tell me your 'House is frequented by People of great Quality'  The Landlady answered in the Affirmative saying  'There were a great many very good Quality and  Gentlefolks in it now There's young Squire  Allworthy  as that Gentleman there knows'  'And pray who is this young Gentleman of Quality this young Squire  Allworthy'  said  Abigail  'Who should he be' answered  Partridge  'but the Son and Heir of the great Squire  Allworthy  of  Somersetshire  '  'Upon my Word' said she 'you tell me strange News For I know Mr  Allworthy  of  Somersetshire  very well and I know he hath no Son alive'  The Landlady pricked up her Ears at this and  Partridge  looked a little confounded However after a short Hesitatation he answered  'Indeed Madam it is true every body doth not know him to be Squire  Allworthy  's Son for he was never married to his Mother but his Son he certainly is and will be his Heir too as certainly as his Name is  Jones  '  At that Word  Abigail  let drop the Bacon which she was conveying to her Mouth and cried out  'You surprize me Sir Is it possible Mr  Jones  should be now in the House'  'Quare non'  answered  Partridge  'it is possible and it is certain  Abigail  now made Haste to finish the Remainder of her Meal and then repaired back to her Mistress when the Conversation passed which may be read in the next Chapter  CHAP V  Shewing who the amiable Lady and her unamiable Maid were  AS in the Month of  June  the Damask Rose which Chance hath planted among the Lillies with their candid Hue mixes his Vermilion Or as some playsome Heifer in the pleasant Month of  May  diffuses her oderiferous Breath over the flowery Meadows Or as in the blooming Month of  April  the gentle constant Dove perched on some fair Bough  sits meditating her Mate so looking a hundred Charms and breathing as many Sweets her Thoughts being fixed on her  Tommy  with a Heart as good and innocent as her Face was beautiful  Sophia  for it was she herself lay reclining her lovely Head on her Hand when her Maid entered the Room and running directly to the Bed cried  'MadamMadamwho doth your Ladyship think is in the House'  Sophia  starting up cried  'I hope my Father hath not overtaken us'  'No Madam it is one worth a hundred Fathers Mr  Jones  himself is here at this very Instant' Mr  Jones'  says  Sophia  'it is impossible I cannot be so fortunate'  Her Maid averred the Fact and was presently detached by her Mistress to order him to be called for she said she was resolved to see him immediately  Mrs  Honour  had no sooner left the Kitchen in the Manner we have before seen than the Landlady fell severely upon her The poor Woman had indeed been loading her Heart with foul Language for some Time and now it scoured out of her Mouth as Filth doth from a MudCart when the Board which con+sines it is removed  Partridge  likewise shovelled in his share of Calumny and what may surprize the Reader not only bespattered the Maid but attempted to fully the Lillywhite Character of  Sophia  herself  'Never a Barrel the better Herring' cries he  'Noscitur a socio  is a true Saying It must be con+fessed indeed that the Lady in the fine Garment is the civiller of the two but I warrant neither o  them are a Bit better than they should be A Coupl  of  Bath  Trulls I'll answer for them your Qualit  don't ride about at this Time o'Night without Ser+vants'  'Sbodlikins and that's true' cries th  Landlady 'you have certainly hit upon the very Mat+ter for Quality don't come into a House without bespeaking a Supper whether they eat or no'  While they were thus discoursing Mrs  Honour  returned and discharged her Commission by bidding the Landlady immediately awake Mr  Jones  and tell him a Lady wanted to speak with him The Landlady referred to  Partridge  saying  'he was the Squire's Friend but for her Part she never called Men Folks especially Gentlemen'  and then walked sullenly out of the Kitchen  Honour  applied herself to  Partridge  but he refused  'For my Friend' cries he 'went to Bed very late and he would be very angry to be disturbed so soon'  Mrs  Honour  insisted still to have him called saying  'She was sure instead of being angry that he would be to the highest Degree delighted when he knew the Occasion'  Another Time perhaps he might' cries  Partridge  'but  non omnia possumus omnes  One Woman is enough at once for a reasonrble Man  What do you mean by one Woman Fellow'  cries  Honour  None of your Fellow'  answered  Partridge  He then proceeded to inform her plainly that  Jones  was in Bed with a Wench and made use of an Expression too indelicate to be here inserted which so enraged Mrs  Honour  that she called him saucy Jackanapes and returned in a violent Hurry to her Mistress whom she acquainted with the Success of her Errand and with the Account she had received which if possible she exaggerated being as angry with  Jones  as if he had pronounced all the Words that came from the Mouth of  Partridge  She discharged a Torrent of Abuse on the Master and advised her Mistress to quit all Thoughts of a Man who had never shewn himself deserving of her She then ripped up the Story of  Molly Seagrim  and gave the most malicious Turn to his formerly quitting  Sophia  herself which I must confess the present Incident not a littl countenanced  The Spirits of  Sophia  were too much dissipated by Concern to enable her to stop the Torrent of her  Maid  At last however she interrupted her saying 'I never can believe this some Villain hath belied him You say you had it from his Friend but surely it is not the Office of a Friend to betray such Secrets'  'I suppose' cries  Honour  'the Fellow is his Pimp for I never saw so illlooked a Villain Besides such profligate Rakes as Mr  Jones  are never ashamed of these Matters'  To say the Truth this Behaviour of  Partridge  was a little inexcusable but he had not slept off the Effect of the Dose which he swallowed the Evening before which had in the Morning received the Addition of about a Pint of Wine or indeed rather of Malt Spirits for the Perry was by no Means pure Now that Part of his Head which Nature designed for the Reservoir of Drink being very shallow a small Quantity of Liquor overflowed it and opened the Sluices of his Heart so that all the Secrets there deposited run out These Sluices were indeed naturally very ill secured To give the best natured Turn we can to his disposition he was a very honest Man for as he was the most inquisitive of Mortals and eternally prying into the Secrets of others so he very faithfully paid them by communicating in Return every thing within his Knowledge  While  Sophia  tormented with Anxiety knew not what to believe nor what Resolution to take  Susan  arrived with the SackWhey Mrs  Honour  immediately advised her Mistress in a Whisper to pump this Wench who probably could inform her of the Truth  Sophia  approved it and began as follows  'Come hither Child now answer me truly what I am going to ask you and I promise you I will very well reward you Is there a young Gentleman in' this House a handsome young Gentleman that  Here  Sophia  blushed and was confounded  'A young Gentleman' cries  Honour  'that came hither in Company with that fancy Rascal who is now in the  Kitchen'  Susan  answered  'There was''Do you know any Thing of any Lady'  continues  Sophia  'any Lady I don't ask you whether she is handsome or no perhaps she is not that's nothing to the Purpose but do you know of any Lady'  La Madam cries  Honour  you will make a very bad Examiner Harkee Child' says she 'Is not that very young Gentleman now in Bed with' some nasty Trull or other  Here  Susan  smiled and was silent  'Answer the Question Child says  Sophia  'and here's a Guinea for you'  'A Guinea Madam cries  Susan  'La what's a Guinea If my Mistress should know it I shall certainly lose my Place that very Instant'  'Here's another for you' says  Sophia  'and I promise you faithfully your Mistress shall never know it'  Susan  after a very short Hesitation took the Money and told his whole Story concluding with saying  'If you have a great Curiosity Madam I can steal softly into the Room and see whether he be in his own Bed or no'  She accordingly did this by  Sophia  's Desire and returned with an Answer in the Negative  Sophia  now trembled and turned pale Mrs  Honour  begged her to be comforted and not to think any more of so worthless a Fellow  'Why there' says  Susan  'I hope Madam your Ladyship won't be offended but pray Madam is not your Ladyship's Name Madam  Sophia Western'  'How is it possible you should know me answered  Sophia  'Why that Man that the Gentlewoman spoke of who is in the Kitchen told about you last Night But I hope your Ladyship is not angry with me' 'Indeed Child' said she 'I am not pray tell me all and I promise you I'll reward you' 'Why Madam' continued  Susan  'that Man told us all in the Kitchen that Madam  Sophia Western  Indeed I don't know how to bring it out'  Here she stopt till having received Encouragement from  Sophia  and being vehemently pressed by Mrs  Honour  she proceeded thus  'He told us Madam tho' to be sure it is all a Lie that your Ladyship was dying for Love of the young Squire and that he was going to the Wars to get rid of you I thought to myself then he was a falsehearted Wretch but now to see such a fine rich beautiful Lady as you be forsaken for such an ordinary Woman for to be sure so she is and another Man's Wife into the Bargain It is such a strange unnatural thing in a Manner'  Sophia  gave her a third Guinea and telling her she would certainly be her Friend if she mentioned nothing of what had passed nor informed any one who she was dismissed the Girl with Orders to the PostBoy to get the Horses ready immediately  Being now left alone with her Maid she told her trusty Waitingwoman  'That she never was more easy than at present I am now convinced' said she 'he is not only a Villain but a low despicable Wretch I can forgive all rather than his exposing my Name in so barbarous a Manner That renders him the Object of my Contempt Yes  Ho+nour  I am now easy I am indeed I am very easy and then she burst into a violent Flood o  Tears'  After a short Interval spent chiefly by  Sophia  i  crying and assuring her Maid that she was perfectly easy  Susan  arrived with an Account that the Horse  were ready when a very extraordinary Thought sug+gested itself to our young Heroine by which Mr  Jones  would be acquainted with her having been a  the Inn in a Way which if any Sparks of Affec+tion for her remained in him would be some Punish+ment at least for his Faults  The Reader will be pleased to remember a little Muff which hath had the Honour of being more than once remembered already in this History Thi  Muff ever since the Departure of Mr  Jones  ha  been the constant companion of  Sophia  by Day and her Bedfellow by Night and this Muff she had at this very Instant upon her Arm whence she took it off with great Indignation and having writ her Name with her Pencil upon a Piece of Paper which she pinned to it she bribed the Maid to convey it into the empty Bed of Mr  Jones  in which if he did not find it she charged her to take some Method of conveying it before his Eyes in the Morning  Then having paid for what Mrs  Honour  had eaten in which Bill was included an Account for what she herself might have eaten she mounted her Horse and once more assuring her Companion that she was perfectly easy continued her Journey  CHAP VI  Containing among other Things the Ingenuity of  Partridge  the Madness of  Jones  and the Folly of  Fitzpatrick  IT was now past Five in the Morning and other Company began to rise and come to the Kitchen among whom were the Serjeant and the Coachman who being thoroughly reconciled made a Libation or in the  English  Phrase drank a hearty Cup together  In this Drinking nothing more remarkable happened than the Behaviour of  Partridge  who when the Serjeant drank a Health to King  George  repeated only the Word King Nor could he be brought to utter more For tho' he was going to sight against his own Cause yet he could not be prevailed upon to drink against it  Mr  Jones  being now returned to his own Bed but from whence we returned he must beg to be excused from relating summoned  Partridge  from this agreeable Company who after a ceremonious Preface  having obtained leave to offer his Advice delivered himself as follows  'It is Sir an old Saying and a true one that a wise Man may sometimes learn Council from a Fool wish therefore I might be so bold as to offer you my Advice which is to return home again and leave these  Horrida Bella  these bloody Wars to Fellows who are contented to swallow Gunpowder because they have nothing to eat Now every body knows your Honour wants for nothing at home when that's the Case why should any Man travel abroad'  'Partridge'  cries  Jones  'thou art certainly a Coward I wish therefore thou would'st return home thyself and trouble me no more'  'I ask your Honour's Pardon' cries  Partridge  'I spoke on your Account more than my own for as to me Heaven knows my Circumstances are bad enough and I am so far from being afraid that I value a Pistol or a Blunderbuss or any such Thing no more than a Popgun Every Man must die once and what signifies the Manner how besides perhaps I may come off with the Loss only of an Arm or a Leg I assure you Sir I was never less afraid in my Life and so if your Honour is resolved to go on I am resolved to follow you But in that Case I wish I might give my Opinion To be sure it is a scandalous Way of travelling for a great Gentleman like you to walk afoot Now here are two or three good Horses in the Stable which the Landlord will certainly make no Scruple of trusting you with but if he should I can easily contrive to take them and let the worst come to the worst the King would certainly pardon you as you are going to fight in his Cause'  Now as the Honesty of  Partridge  was equal to his Understanding and both dealt only in small Matters he would never have attempted a Roguery of this  Kind had he not imagined it altogether safe for he was one of those who have more consideration of the Gallows than of the Fitness of Things but in Reality he thought he might have committed this Felony without any Danger For besides that he doubted not but the Name of Mr  Allworthy  would sufficiently quiet the Landlord he conceived they should be altogether safe whatever Turn Affairs might take as  Jones  he imagined would have Friends enough on one Side and as his Friends would as well secure him on the other  When Mr  Jones  found that  Partridge  was in earnest in this Proposal he very severely rebuked him and that in such bitter Terms that the other attempted to laugh it off and presently turned the Discourse to other Matters saying he believed they were then in a Bawdyhouse and that he had with much ado prevented two Wenches from disturbing his Honour in the middle of the Night  'Heyday' says he 'I believe they got into your Chamber whether I would or no for here lies the Muff of one of them on the Ground'  Indeed as  Jones  returned to his Bed in the Dark he had never perceived the Muff on the Quilt and in leaping into his Bed he had tumbled it on the Floor This  Partridge  now took up and was going to put into his Pocket when  Jones  desired to see it The Muff was so very remarkable that our Heroe might possibly have recollected it without the Information annexed But his Memory was not put to that hard Office for at the same Instant he saw and read the Words  Sophia Western  upon the Paper which was pinned to it His Looks now grew frantic in a Moment and he eagerly cried out  'Oh Heavens how came this Muff here' 'I know no more than your Honour' cried  Partridge  'but I saw it upon the Arm of one of the Women who would have disturbed you if I would have suffered them' 'Where are they'  cries  Jones  jumping out of Bed and  laying hold of his Clothes  'Many Miles off I believe' by this Time'  said  Partridge  And now  Jones  upon further Enquiry was sufficiently assured that the Bearer of this Muff was no other than the lovely  Sophia  herself  The Behaviour of  Jones  on this Occasion His Thoughts his Looks his Words his Actions were such as  Beggar all Description  After many bitter Execrations on  Partridge  and not fewer on himself he ordered the poor Fellow who was frightened out of his Wits to run down and hire him Horses at any rate and a very few Minutes afterwards having shuffled on his Clothes he hastened down Stairs to execute the Orders himself which he had just before given  But before we proceed to what passed on his Arrival in the Kitchen it will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since  Partridge  had first left it on his Master's Summons  The Serjeant was just marched off with his Party when the two  Irish  Gentlemen arose and came down Stairs both complaining that they had been so often waked by the Noises in the Inn that they had never once been able to close their Eyes all Night  The Coach which had brought the young Lady and her Maid and which perhaps the Reader may have hitherto concluded was her own was indeed a returned Coach belonging to Mr  King  of  Bath  one of the worthiest and honestest Men that ever dealt in Horseflesh and whose Coaches we heartily recom+mend to all our Readers who travel that Road By which Means they may perhaps have the Pleasure of riding in the very Coach and being driven by the very Coachman that is recorded in this History  The Coachman having but two Passengers and hearing Mr  Maclachlan  was bound to  Bath  offered to carry him thither at a very moderate Price He was induced to this by the Report of the Ostler who  said that the Horse which Mr  Maclachlan  had hired  rom  Worcester  would be much more pleased with re  rning to his Friend there than to prosecute a long  ourney for that the said Horse was rather a two  gged than a fourlegged Animal  Mr  Maclachlan  immediately closed with the Proposal of the Coachman and at the same Time per  aded his Friend  Fitzpatrick  to accept of the fourth  lace in the Coach This Conveyance the Soreness  f his Bones made more agreeable to him than a Horse  nd being well assured of meeting with his Wife at  ath  he thought a little Delay would be of no Con  equence  Maclachlan  who was much the sharper Man of the  wo no sooner heard that this Lady came from  Ches  r  with the other Circumstances which he learned  rom the Ostler than it came into his Head that she  ight possibly be his Friend's Wife and presently ac  uainted him with this Suspicion which had never  nce occurred to  Fitzpatrick  himself To say the  ruth he was one of those Compositions which Na  re makes up in two great a Hurry and forgets to at any Brains in their Head  Now it happens to this sort of Men as to bad  ounds who never hit off a Fault themselves but no  oner doth a Dog of Sagacity open his Mouth than  ey immediately do the same and without the Guide  any Scent run directly forwards as fast as they are  le In the same Manner the very Moment Mr  Maclachlan  had mentioned his Apprehension Mr  Fitzpatrick  instantly concurred and flew directly up  airs to surprize his Wife before he knew where she  as and unluckily as Fortune loves to play Tricks  ith those Gentlemen who put themselves entirely un  r her Conduct ran his Head against several Doors  d Posts to no Purpose Much kinder was she to  when she suggested that Simile of the Hounds  before inserted since the poor Wife may on these  Occasions be so justly compared to a hunted Hare Like that little wretched Animal she pricks up her Ears to listen after the Voice of her Pursuer like her flies away trembling when she hears it and like her is generally overtaken and destroyed in the End  This was not however the Case at present for after a long fruitless Search Mr  Fitzpatrick  returned to the Kitchen where as if this had been a rea  Chace entered a Gentleman hallowing as Hunter do when the Hounds are at Fault He was just a lighting from his Horse and had many Attendants a  his Heels  Here Reader it may be necessary to acquaint the  with some Matters which if thou dost know already thou art wiser than I take thee to be And this Infor+mation thou shalt receive in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  In which are included the Adventures that happened a the Inn at  Upton  IN the first Place then this Gentleman just arrive  was no other Person than Squire  Western  himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter an  had he fortunately been two Hours earlier he had no  only found her but his Neice into the Bargain fo  such was the Wife of Mr  Fitzpatrick  who had ru  away with her five Years before out of the Custod  of that sage Lady Madam  Western  Now this Lady had departed from the Inn muc  about at the same Time with  Sophia  For having bee  waked by the Voice of her Husband she had sent u  for the Landlady and being by her apprized of th  Matter had bribed the good Woman at an extra+vagant Price to furnish her with Horses for her e  +cape Such Prevalence had Money in this Family and tho' the Mistress would have turned away he  Maid for a corrupt Hussy if she had known as much  s the Reader yet she was no more Proof against Corruption herself than poor  Susan  had been  Mr  Western  and his Nephew were not known to one another nor indeed would the former have taken any Notice of the latter if he had known him for this being a stolen Match and consequently an unnatural one in the Opinion of the good Squire he had from the Time of her committing it abandoned he poor young Creature who was then no more than Eighteen as a Monster and had never since suffered her to be named in his Presence  The Kitchen was now a Scene of universal Confusion  Western  enquiring after his Daughter and  Fitzpatrick  as eagerly after his Wife when  Jones  entered the Room unfortunately having  Sophia  's Muff in his Hand  As soon as  Western  saw  Jones  he set up the same Holla as is used by Sportsmen when their Game is in View He then immediately run up and laid hold of  Jones  crying 'We have got the Dog Fox I warrant the Bitch is not far off' The Jargon which followed for some Minutes where many spoke different Things at the same Time as it would be very difficult to discribe so would it be no less unpleasant to read  Jones  having at length shaken Mr  Western  off and some of the Company having interfered between them our Heroe protested his Innocence as to knowing any thing of the Lady when Parson  Supple  stepped up and said  'It is Folly to deny it for why the Marks of Guilt are in thy Hands I will myself asseverate and bind it by an Oath that the Muff thou bearest in thy Hand belonged unto Madam  Sophia  for I have frequently observed her of later Days to bear it about her' 'My Daughter's Muff' cries the Squire in a Rage 'Hath he  got my Daughter's Muff Bear Witness the Goo  are found upon him I'll have him before a Justi  of Peace this Instant Where is my Daughter Vi  +lain' 'Sir' said  Jones  'I beg you would  +pacified The Muff I acknowledge is the youn  Lady's but upon my Honour I have never see her'  At these Words  Western  lost all Patienc  and grew inarticulate with Rage  Some of the Servants had acquainted  Fitzpatric  who Mr  Western  was The good  Irishman  there fore thinking he had now an Opportunity to do a Act of Service to his Uncle and by that Means mig  possibly obtain his Favour stept up to  Jones  an  cried out  'Upon my Conscience Sir you may  ashamed of denying your having seen the Gentle+man's Daughter before my Face when you kno  I found you there upon the Bed together'  The turning to  Western  he offered to conduct him imme+diately to the Room where his Daughter was which Offer being accepted he the Squire the Parson and some others ascended directly to Mrs  Waters  Chamber which they entered with no less Violence than Mr  Fitzpatrick  had done before  The poor Lady started from her Sleep with a much Amazement as Terror and beheld at her Bed side a Figure which might very well be supposed  have escaped out of  Bedlam  Such Wildness an  Confusion were in the Looks of Mr  Western  wh  no sooner saw the Lady than he started back show+ing sufficiently by his Manner before he spoke th  this was not the Person sought after  So much more tenderly do Women value their Re+putation than their Persons that tho' the latter seem+ed now in more Danger than before yet as the for+mer was secure the Lady screamed not with such Vi+olence as she had done on the other Occasion How+ever she no sooner found herself alone than she a+bandoned all Thoughts of further Repose and as sh  had sufficient Reason to be dissatisfied with her present Lodging she dressed herself with all possible Expedition  Mr  Western  now proceeded to search the whole House but to as little Purpose as he had disturbed poor Mrs  Waters  He then returned disconsolate into the Kitchen where he found  Jones  in the Custody of his Servants  This violent Uproar had raised all the People in the House tho' it was yet scarcely Daylight Among these was a grave Gentleman who had the Honour to be in the Commission of the Peace for the County of  Worcester  Of which Mr  Western  was no sooner informed than he offered to lay his Complaint before him The Justice declined executing his Office as he said he had no Clerk present nor no Book about Justice Business And that he could not carry all the Law in his Head about stealing away Daughters and such Sort of Things  Here Mr  Fitzpatrick  offered to lend him his Assistance informing the Company that he had been himself bred to the Law And indeed he had served three Years as Clerk to an Attorney in the North of  Ireland  when chusing a genteeler Walk in Life he quitted his Master came over to  England  and set up that Business which requires no Apprenticeship namely that of a Gentleman in which he had succeeded as hath been already partly mentioned  Mr  Fitzpatrick  declared that the Law concerning Daughters was out of the present Case that stealing a Muff was undoubtedly Felony and the Goods being found upon the Person were sufficient Evidence of the Fact  The Magistrate upon the Encouragement of so learned a Coadjutor and upon the violent Intercession of the Squire was at length prevailed upon to seat himself in the Chair of Justice where being placed upon viewing the Muff which  Jones  still held  in his Hand and upon the Parson's swearing it to be the Property of Mr  Western  he desired Mr  Fitzpa+trick  to draw up a Commitment which he said h  would sign  Jones  now desired to be heard which was at last with Difficulty granted him He then produced th  Evidence of Mr  Partridge  as to the finding it but what was still more  Susan  deposed that  Sophia  her+self had delivered the Muff to her and had ordered her to convey it into the Chamber where Mr  Jones  had found it  Whether a natural Love of Justice or the extraor+dinary Comeliness of  Jones  had wrought on  Susa  to make the Discovery I will not determine but such were the Effects of her Evidence that the Ma+gistrate throwing himself back in his Chair declare  that the Matter was now altogether as clear on th  Side of the Prisoner as it had before been against him with which the Parson concurred saying The Lord forbid he should be instrumental in committing an innocent Person to Durance The Justice then arose acquitted the Prisoner and broke up the Court  Mr  Western  now gave every one present a hearty Curse and immediately ordering his Horses departed in pursuit of his Daughter without taking the lea  Notice of his Nephew  Fitzpatrick  or returning any Answer to his Claim of Kindred notwithstanding al  the Obligations he had just received from that Gen+tleman In the Violence moreover of his Hurry and of his Passion he luckily forgot to demand th  Muff of  Jones  I say luckily for he would have died on the Spot rather than have parted with it  Jones  likewise with his Friend  Partridge  set for ward the Moment he had paid his Reckoning in Que  of his lovely  Sophia  whom he now resolved never more to abandon the Pursuit of Nor could he bring him self even to take Leave of Mrs  Waters  of whom  he detested the very Thoughts as she had been tho'  ot designedly the Occasion of his missing the happiest Interview with  Sophia  to whom he now vowed  ternal Constancy  As for Mrs  Waters  she took the Opportunity of he Coach which was going to  Bath  for which Place he set out in Company with the two  Irish  Gentlemen he Landlady kindly lending her her Clothes in  for which she was contented only to receive a  out double their Value as a Recompence for the  oan Upon the Road she was perfectly reconciled  Mr  Fitzpatrick  who was a very handsome Fellow  nd indeed did all she could to console him in the Ab  nce of his Wife  Thus ended the many odd Adventures which Mr  Jones  encountered at his Inn at  Upton  where they  to this Day of the Beauty and lovely Behaviour  f the charming  Sophia  by the Name of the  Somer  shire  Angel  CHAP VIII  In which the History goes backward  BEFORE we proceed any farther in our History it may be proper to look a little back in order account for the extraordinary Appearance of  Sophia  nd her Father at the Inn at  Upton  The Reader may be pleased to remember that in  e Ninth Chapter of the Seventh Book of our His  ry we left  Sophia  after a long Debate between  ove and Duty deciding the Cause as it usually I  elieve happens in Favour of the Former  This Debate had arisen as we have there shewn  om a Visit which her Father had just before made  r in order to force her Consent to a Marriage with  Blifil  and which he had understood to be fully im  ied in her Acknowledgment  that she neither must  could refuse any absolute Command of his  Now from this Visit the Squire retired to his Evening Potation overjoyed at the Success he had had with his Daughter and as he was of a social Disposition and willing to have Partakers in his Happiness the Beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the Kitchen so that before Eleven in the Evening there was not a single Person sober in the House except only Mrs  Western  herself and the charming  Sophia  Early in the Morning a Messenger was dispatched to summon Mr  Blifil  For tho' the Squire imagined that young Gentleman had been much less acquainted than he really was with the former Aversion of hi  Daughter as he had not however yet received he  Consent he longed impatiently to communicate it to him not doubting but that the intended Bride herself would confirm it with her Lips As to the Wedding it had the Evening before been fixed by the Mal  Parties to be celebrated on the next Morning sav  one  Breakfast was now set forth in the Parlour where Mr  Blifil  attended and where the Squire and his Sister likewise were assembled and now  Sophia  was order+ed to be called  O  Shakespear  had I thy Pen O  Hogarth  ha  I thy Pencil then would I draw the Picture of th  poor ServingMan who with pale Countenance staring Eyes chattering Teeth faultering Tongue and trembling Limbs  E'en such a Man so faint so spiritless  So dull so dead in Look so woebegone  Drew  Priam  's Curtains in the dead of Night  And would have told him half his  Troy  wa  burn'd  entered the Room and declared  That Madam  So+phia  was not be found  'Not to be found' cries the Squire starting from his Chair 'Zounds and Dnation Blood and Fury Where when how whatNot to be found where'  'La Brother' said Mrs  Western'  with true political Coldness 'you are always throwing yourself into such violent Passions for nothing My Niece I suppose is only walked out into the Garden I protest you are grown so unreasonable that it is impossible to live in the House with you'  'Nay nay' answered the Squire returning as suddenly to himself as he had gone from himself 'if that be all the Matter it signifies not much but upon my Soul my Mind misgave me when the Fellow said she was not to be found'  He then gave Orders for the Bell to be rung in the Garden and sat himself contentedly down  No two Things could be more the Reverse of each other than were the Brother and Sister in most Instances particularly in this That as the Brother never foresaw any Thing at a Distance but was most sagacious in immediately seeing every Thing the Moment it had happened so the Sister eternally foresaw at a Distance but was not so quicksighted to Objects before her Eyes Of both these the Reader may have observed Examples And indeed both their several Talents were excessive For as the Sister often foresaw what never came to pass so the Brother often saw much more than was actually the Truth  This was not however the Case at present The same Report was brought from the Garden as before had been brought from the Chamber that Madam  Sophia  was not to be found  The Squire himself now sallied forth and begun to  oar forth the Name of  Sophia  as loudly and in as  oarse a Voice as whileom did  Hercules  that of  Hylas  And as the Poet tells us that the whole Shore ecchoed back the Name of that beautiful Youth so did the  House the Garden and all the neighbouring Fields resound nothing but the Name of  Sophia  in the hoarse Voice of the Men and in the shrill Pipes of the Women while Echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved Sound that if there is really such a Person I believe  Ovid  hath belied her Sex  Nothing reigned for a long Time but Confusion 'till at last the Squire having sufficiently spent his Breath returned to the Parlour where he found Mrs  Western  and Mr  Blifil  and threw himself with the utmost Dejection in his Countenance into a great Chair  Here Mrs  Western  began to apply the following Consolation  'Brother I am sorry for what hath happened and that my Niece should have behaved herself in a Manner so unbecoming her Family but it is all your own Doings and you have no Body to thank but yourself You know she hath been educated always in a Manner directly contrary to my Advice and now you see the Consequence Have I not a thousand Times argued with you about giving my Niece her own Will But you know I never could prevail upon you And when I had taken so much Pains to eradicate her headstrong Opinions and to rectify your Errors in Policy you know she was taken out of my Hands so that I have nothing to answer for Had I been trusted entirely with the Care of her Education no such Accident as this had ever befallen you So that you must comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own Doings and indeed what else could be expected from such Indulgence'  "Zounds Sister' answered he' 'you are enough to make one mad Have I indulged her Have I given her her WillIt was no longer ago than last night Night that I threatened if she disobeyed me to confine her to her Chamber upon  Bread and Water as long as she livedYou would provoke the Patience of  Job'  "Did ever Mortal hear the like" replied she 'Brother if I had not the Patience of fifty  Jobs  you would make me forget all Decency and Decorum Why would you interfere Did I not beg you did I not entreat you to leave the whole Conduct to me You have defeated all the Operations of the Campaign by one false Step Would any Man in his Senses have provoked a Daughter by such Threats as these How often have I told you that  English  Women are not to be treated like  Cira  essian  Possibly  Cireassian  Slaves We have the Protection of the World We are to be won by gentle Means only and not to be hectored and bullied and beat into Compliance I thank Heaven no  Salique  Law governs here Brother you have a Roughness in your Manner which no Woman but myself would bear I do not wonder my Niece was frightned and terrified into taking this Measure and to speak honestly I think my Niece will be justified to the World for what she hath done I repeat it to you again Brother you must confort yourself by remembering that it is all your own Fault How often have I advised  'Here  Western  rose hastily from his Chair and venting two or three horrid Imprecations ran out of the Room  When he was departed his Sister expressed more Bitterness if possible against him than she had done while he was present for the Truth of which she appealed to Mr  Blifil  who with great Complaisance acquiesced entirely in all she said but excused all the faults of Mr  Western  'as they must be considered' he said 'to have proceeded from the too inordinate Fondness of a Father which must be allowed the Name of an amiable Weakness'  'So much the  more inexcusable' answer'd the Lady 'for whom doth he ruin by his Fondness but his own Child'  To which  Blifil  immediately agreed  Mrs  Western  then began to express great Confusion on the Account of Mr  Blifil  and of the Usage  which he had received from a Family to which he intended so much Honour On this Subject she treated the Folly of her Niece with great Severity but concluded with throwing the whole on her Brother who she said was inexcusable to have proceeded so far without better Assurances of his Daughter's Consent  'But he was says she always of a violent headstrong Temper and I can scarce forgive myself for all the Advice I have thrown away upon him'  After much of this Kind of Conversation which perhaps would not greatly entertain the Reader was it here particularly related Mr  Blifil  took his Leave and returned home not highly pleased with his Disappointment which however the Philosophy which he had acquired from  Square  and the Religion infused into him by  Thwackum  together with somewhat else taught him to bear rather better than more passionate Lovers bear these Kinds of Evils  CHAP IX  The Escape of  Sophia  IT is now Time to look after  Sophia  whom the Reader if he loves her half so well as I do will rejoice to find escaped from the Clutches of her pas+sionate Father and from those of her dispassionate Lover  Twelve Times did the iron Register of Time bea  on the sonorous Bellmetal summoning the Ghosts to rise and walk their nightly RoundIn plaine Language it was Twelve o' Clock and all the Fa+mily as we have said lay buried in Drink and Sleep except only Mrs  Western  who was deeply engaged in reading a political Pamphlet and except our Heroine  who now softly stole down Stairs and having unbarred and unlocked one of the House Doors sallied forth and hastened to the Place of Appointment  Notwithstanding the many pretty Arts which Ladies sometimes practise to display their Fears on every little Occasion almost as many as the other Sex uses to conceal theirs certainly there is a Degree of Courage which not only becomes a Woman but is often necessary to enable her to discharge her Duty It is indeed the Idea of Fierceness and not of Bravery which destroys the Female Character For who can read the Story of the justly celebrated  Arria  without conceiving as high an Opinion of her Gentleness and Tenderness as of her Fortitude At the same Time perhaps many a Woman who shrieks at a Mouse or a Rat may be capable of poisoning a Husband or what is worse of driving him to poison himself  Sophia  with all the Gentleness which a Woman can have had all the Spirit which she ought to have When therefore she came to the Place of Appointment and instead of meeting her Maid as was agreed saw a Man ride directly up to her she neither screamed out nor fainted away Not that her Pulse then beat with its usual Regularity for she was at first under some Surprize and Apprehension But these were relieved almost as soon as raised when the Man pulling off his Hat asked her in a very submissive Manner  'If her Ladyship did not expect to meet another Lady' And then proceeded to inform her that he was sent to conduct her to that Lady'  Sophia  could have no possible suspicion of any Falshood in this Account She therefore mounted resolutely behind the Fellow who conveyed her safe to a Town about Five Miles distant where she had the Satisfaction of finding the good Mrs  Honour  For as the Soul of the Waitingwoman was wrapt up in  those very Habiliments which used to enwrap her Body she could by no Means bring herself to trust them out of her Sight Upon these therefore she kept Guard in Person while she detached the aforesaid Fellow after her Mistress having given him all proper Instructions  They now debated what Course to take in order to avoid the Pursuit of Mr  Western  who they knew would send after them in a few Hours The  London  Road had such Charms for  Honour  that she was desirous of going on directly alledging that as  Sophia  could not be missed till Eight or Nine the next Morning her Pursuers would not be able to overtake her even though they knew which Way she had gone But  Sophia  had too much at Stake to venture any Thing to Chance nor did she dare to trust too much to her tender Limbs in a Contest which was to be decided only by Swiftness She resolved therefore to travel across the Country for at least Twenty or Thirty Miles and then to take the direct Road to  London  So having hired her Horses to go Twenty Miles one Way when she intended to go Twenty Miles the other she set forward with the same Guide behind whom she had ridden from her Father's House the Guide having now taken up behind him in the Room of  Sophia  a much heavier as well as much less lovely Burthen being indeed a huge Portmanteau well stuffed with those outside Ornaments by Means of which the fair  Honour  hoped to gain many Conquests and finally to make her Fortune in  London  City  When they had gone about Two hundred Paces from the Inn on the  London  Road  Sophia  rode up to the Guide and with a Voice much fuller of Honey than was ever that of  Anacreon  though his Mouth is supposed to have been a Beehive begged him to take the first Turning which led towards  Bristol  Reader I am not superstitious nor any great Believer in modern Miracles I do not therefore deliver the following as a certain Truth for indeed I can scarce credit it myself But the Fidelity of an Historian obliges me to relate what hath been confidently asserted The Horse then on which the Guide rode is reported to have been so charmed by  Sophia  's Voice that he made a full Stop and exprest an Unwillingness to proceed any farther  Perhaps however the Fact may be true and less miraculous then it hath been represented since the natural Cause seems adequate to the Effect For as the Guide at that Moment desisted from a constant Application of his armed right Heel for like  Hudibras  he wore but one Spur it is more than possible that this Omission alone might occasion the Beast to stop especially as this was very frequent with him at other Times  But if the Voice of  Sophia  had really an Effect on the Horse it had very little on the Rider He answered somewhat surlily  'That Measter had ordered him to go a different Way and that he should lose his Place if he went any other than that he was ordered'  Sophia  finding all her Persuasions had no Effect began now to add irresistible Charms to her Voice Charms which according to the Proverb makes the old Mare trot instead of standing still Charms to which modern Ages have attributed all that irresistible Force which the Ancients imputed to perfect Oratory In a Word she promised she would reward him to his utmost Expectation  The Lad was not totally deaf to these Promises but he disliked their being indefinite For tho' perhaps he had never heard that Word yet that in Fact was his Objection  'He said Gentlevolks did not consider the Case of poor Volks that he had like to have been turned away the other Day for riding about the Country  with a Gentleman from Squire  Allworthy  's who did not reward him as he should have done'  'With whom says  Sophia  eagerlyWith a Gentleman from Squire  Allworthy  's repeated the Lad 'the Squire's Son I think they call 'un''Whither which Way did he go says  Sophia  Why a little o' one Side o'  Bristol  about twenty Miles off'  answered the LadGuide me' says  Sophia  'to the same Place and I'll give thee a Guinea or two if one is not sufficient' 'To be certain said the Boy it is honestly worth two when your Ladyship considers what a Risk I run but however if your Ladyship will promise me the two Guineas I'll e'en venture To be certain it is a sinful Thing to ride about my Master's Horses but one Comfort is I can only be turned away and two Guineas will partly make me Amends'  The Bargain being thus struck the Lad turned aside into the  Bristol  Road and  Sophia  set forward in Pursuit of  Jones  highly contrary to the Remonstrances of Mrs  Honour  who had much more Desire to see  London  than to see Mr  Jones  For indeed she was not his Friend with her Mistress as he had been guilty of some Neglect in certain pecuniary Civilities which are by Custom due to the Waitinggentlewoman in all Love Affairs and more especially in those of a clandestine Kind This we impute rather to the Carelessness of his Temper than to any Want of Generosity but perhaps she derived it from the latter Motive Certain it is that she hated him very bitterly on that Account and resolved to take every Opportunity of injuring him with her Mistress It was therefore highly unlucky for her that she had gone to the very same Town and Inn whence  Jones  had started and still more unlucky was she in having stumbled on the same Guide and on this accidental Discovery which  Sophia  had made  Our Travellers arrived at  Hambrook  This was the Village where  Jones  met the Quaker  at the Break of Day where  Honour  was against her Will charged to enquire the Rout which Mr  Jones  had taken Of this indeed the Guide himself could have informed them but  Sophia  I know not for what Reason never asked him the Question  When Mrs  Honour  had made her Report from the Landlord  Sophia  with much Difficulty procured some indifferent Horses which brought her to the Inn where  Jones  had been confined rather by the Misfortune of meeting with a Surgeon than by having met with a broken Head  Here  Honour  being again charged with a Commission of Enquiry had no sooner applied herself to the Landlady and had described the Person of Mr  Jones  than that sagacious Woman began in the vulgar Phrase to smell a Rat When  Sophia  therefore entered the Room instead of answering the Maid the Landlady addressing herself to the Mistress began the following Speech  'Goodlackaday why there now who would have thought it I protest the loveliest Couple that ever Eyes beheld Ifackins Madam it is no Wonder the Squire run on so about your Ladyship He told me indeed you was the finest Lady in the World and to be sure so you be Mercy on him poor Heart I bepitied him so I did when he used to hug his Pillow and call it his dear Madam  Sophia  I did all I could to dissuade himself from going to the Wars I told him there were Men enow that were good for nothing else but to be killed that had not the Love of such fine Ladies'  'Sure' says  Sophia  'the good Woman is distracted  'No no' cries the Landlady 'I am not distracted' 'What doth your Ladyship think I don't know then I assure you he told me all'  What saucy Fellow" cries  Honour  'told you any Thing of my Lady"  No saucy Fellow' answered the Landlady 'but the young Gentleman you enquire after and a very pretty young Gentleman he is and he loves Madam  Sophia Western  to the Bottom of his Soul'  'He love my Lady I'd have you to know Woman' she is Meat for his Master    'Nay  Honour'  said  Sophia  interrupting her 'don't be angry with the good Woman she intends no Harm'  'No marry don't I'  answered the Landlady emboldened by the soft Accents of  Sophia  and then launched into a long Narrative too tedious to be here set down in which some Passages dropt that gave a little Offence to  Sophia  and much more to her Waitingwoman who hence took Occasion to abuse poor  Jones  to her Mistress the Moment they were alone together saying  'that he must be a pitiful Fellow and could have no Love for a Lady whose Name he would thus prostitute in an Alehouse'  Sophia  did not see his Behaviour in so very disadvantageous a Light and was perhaps more pleased with the violent Raptures of his Love which the Landlady exaggrated as much as she had done every other Circumstance than she was offended with the rest and indeed she imputed the whole to the Extravagance or rather Ebullience of his Passion and to the Openness of his Heart  This Incident however being afterward revived in her Mind and placed in the most odious Colours by  Honour  served to heighten and give Credit to those unlucky Occurrences at  Upton  and assisted the Waitingwoman in her Endeavours to make her Mistress depart from that Inn without seeing  Jones  The Landlady finding  Sophia  intended to stay no longer than till her Horses were ready and that without either eating or drinking soon withdrew when  Honour  began to take her Mistress to Task for indeed she used great Freedom and after a long Harangue in which she reminded her of her Intention to go to  London  and gave frequent Hints of the Impropriety of pursuing a young Fellow she at last concluded with this serious Exhortation  'For Heaven's Sake Madam consider what you are about and whither you are a going'  This Advice to a Lady who had already rode near forty Miles and in no very agreeable Season may seem foolish enough It may be supposed she had well considered and resolved this already nay Mrs  Honour  by the Hints she threw out seemed to think so and this I doubt not is the Opinion of many Readers who have I make no Doubt been long since well convinced of the Purpose of our Heroine and have heartily condemned her for it as a wanton Baggage  But in reality this was not the Case  Sophia  had been lately so distracted between Hope and Fear her Duty and Love to her Father her Hatred to  Blifil  her Compassion and why should we not confess the Truth her Love for  Jones  which last the Behaviour of her Father of her Aunt of every one else and more particularly of  Jones  himself had blown into a Flame that her Mind was in that confused State which may be truly said to make us ignorant of what we do or whither we go or rather indeed indifferent as to the Consequence of either  The prudent and sage Advice of her Maid produced however some cool Reflection and she at length determined to go to  Gloucester  and thence to proceed directly to  London  But unluckily a few Miles before she entered that Town she met the HackAttorney who as is beforementioned had dined there with Mr  Jones  This Fellow being well known to Mrs  Honour  stopt and spoke to her of which  Sophia  at that Time took little Notice more than to enquire who he was  But having had a more particular Account from  Honour  of this Man afterwards at  Gloucester  and hearing of the great Expedition he usually made in travelling  for which as hath been before observed he was particularly famous recollecting likewise that she had overheard Mrs  Honour  inform him that they were going to  Gloucester  she began to fear lest her Father might by this Fellow's Means be able to trace her to that City wherefore if she should there strike into the  London  Road she apprehended he would certainly b  able to overtake her She therefore altered her Resolution and having hired Horses to go a Week Journey a Way which she did not intend to travel she again set forward after a light Refreshment con+trary to the Desire and earnest Entreaties of her Maid and to the no less vehement Remonstrances of Mrs  Whitefield  who from good Breeding or perhaps from good Nature for the poor young Lady appeared much fatigued press'd her very heartily to stay that Evening at  Gloucester  Having refreshed herself only with some Tea an  with lying about two Hours on the Bed while he  Horses were getting ready she resolutely left Mrs  Whitefield  's about eleven at Night and striking directly into the  Worcester  Road within less than four Hours arrived at that very Inn where we last saw he  ▪  Having thus traced our Heroine very particularl  back from her Departure till her Arrival at  Upton  we shall in a very few Words bring her Father to th  same Place who having received the first Scent from the Postboy who conducted his Daughter to  Ha  brook  very easily traced her afterwards to  Gloucester  whence he pursued her to  Upton  as he had learn Mr  Jones  had taken that Rout for  Partridge  to  the Squire's Expression left every where a stro  Scent behind him and he doubted not in the least b  Sophia  travelled or as he phrased it ran the sam  Way He used indeed a very coarse Expression which need not be here inserted as Foxhunter who alone would understand it will easily suggest to themselves  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XI  Containing about three Days  CHAP I  a Crust for the Critics  IN our last initial Chapter we may be supposed to have treated that formidable Set of Men who are called Critics with more Freedom than becomes us since they exact and indeed generally receive great Condescention from Authors We shall in this therefore give the Reasons of our Conduct to this august Body and here we shall perhaps place them in a Light in which they have not hitherto been seen  This Word Critic is of  Greek  Derivation and signifies Judgment Hence I presume some Persons who have not understood the Original and have seen the  English  Translation of the Primative have concluded that it meant Judgment in the legal Sense  in which it is frequently used as equivalent to Condemnation  I am the rather inclined to be of that Opinion as the greatest Number of Critics hath of late Year been found amongst the Lawyers Many of these Gentlemen from Despair perhaps of ever rising to the Bench in  Westminsterhall  have placed them selves on the Benches at the Playhouses where they have exerted their judicial Capacity and have given Judgment  i e  condemned without Mercy  The Gentlemen would perhaps be well enough pleased if we were to leave them thus compared to one of the most important and honourable Offices in the Commonwealth and if we intended to apply to their Favour we would do so but as we design to deal very sincerely and plainly too with them we must remind them of another Officer of Justice of a much lower Rank to whom as they not only pronounce but execute their own Judgment they bear likewise some remote Resemblance  But in reality there is another Light in which these modern Critics may with great Justice and Propriety be seen and this is that of a common Slanderer If a Person who prys into the Characters of others with no other Design but to discover their Faults and to publish them to the World deserves the Title of a Slanderer of the Reputations of Men why should not a Critic who reads with the same malevolent View be as properly stiled the Slanderer of the Reputation of Books  Vice hath not I believe a more abject Slave Society produces not a more odious Vermin nor can the Devil receive a Guest more worthy of him no  possibly more welcome to him than a Slanderer The World I am afraid regards not this Monster with half the Abhorrence which he deserves and I am more afraid to assign the Reason of this criminal Lenity shewn towards him yet it is certain that the  Thief looks innocent in the Comparison nay the Murderer himself can seldom stand in Competition with his Guilt For Slander is a more cruel Weapon than a Sword as the Wounds which the former gives are always incurable One Method indeed there is of killing and that the basest and most execrable of all which bears an exact Analogy to the Vice here disclaimed against and that is Poison A Means of Revenge so base and yet so horrible that it was once wisely distinguished by our Laws from all other Murders in the peculiar Severity of the Punishment  Besides the dreadful Mischiefs done by Slander and the Baseness of the Means by which they are effected there are other Circumstances that highly ag  ravate its atrocious Quality For it often proceeds  rom no Provocation and seldom promises itself any Reward unless some black and infernal Mind may  ropose a Reward in the Thoughts of having pro  ured the Ruin and Misery of another  Shakespear  hath nobly touched this Vice when he  ays  Who steals my Gold steals Trash 'tis something nothing  'Twas mine 'tis his and hath been Slave to Thousands  But he who filches from me my good Name  Robs me of that  WHICH NOT ENRICHES HIM  BUT MAKES ME POOR INDEED  With all this my good Reader will doubtless agree  t much of it will probably seem too severe when  pplied to the Slander of Books But let it here be  onsidered that both proceed from the same wicked Disposition of Mind and are alike void of the Ex  use of Temptation Nor shall we conclude the In  y done this Way to be very slight when we con  der a Book as the Author's Offspring and indeed  the Child of his Brain  The Reader who hath suffered his Muse to continue hitherto in a Virgin State can have but a ver  inadequate Idea of this Kind of paternal Fondness To such we may parody the tender Exclamation o  Macduff Alas Thou hast written no Book  Bu  the Author whose Muse hath brought forth will fe  the pathetic Strain perhaps will accompany me wi  Tears especially if his Darling be already no more while I mention the Uneasiness with which the b  Muse bears about her Burden the painful Labour with which she produces it and lastly the Care th  Fondness with which the tender Father nourishes h  Favourite till it be brought to Maturity and produce  into the World  Nor is there any paternal Fondness which seems le  to savour of absolute Instinct which may so well b  reconciled to worldly Wisdom as this These Children may most truly be called the Riches of their Father and many of them have with true filial Piety fe  their Parent in his old Age so that not only the Affection but the Interest of the Author may b  highly injured by these Slanderers whose poisono  Breath brings his Book to an untimely End  Lastly The Slander of a Book is in Truth th  Slander of the Author For as no one can call and ther Bastard without calling the Mother a Whore neither can any one give the Names of sad Stuff horrid Nonsence  c  to a Book without calling the Author a Blockhead which tho' in a moral Sen  it is a preferable Appellation to that of Villain perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly Intere  ▪  Now however ludicrous all this may appear some others I doubt not will feel and acknowledg  the Truth of it nay may perhaps think I have not treated the Subject with decent Solemnity b  surely a Man may speak Truth with a smiling Courtenance In reality to depreciate a Book maliciou  ly or even wontonly is at least a very illnature  Office and a morose snarling Critic may I believe  e suspected to be a bad Man  I will therefore endeavour in the remaining Part of this Chapter to explain the Marks of this Character and to shew what Criticism I here intend to  obviate For I can never be understood unless by the very Persons here meant to insinuate that there are no proper Judges of Writing or to endeavour to exclude from the Commonwealth of Literature any of those noble Critics to whose Labours the learned World are so greatly indebted Such were  Aristotle Horace  and  Longinus  among the Ancients  Dacier  and  Bossu  among the  French  and some perhaps among us who have certainly been duly authorized to execute at least a judicial Authority in  Foro Literario  But without ascertaining all the proper Qualifications of a Critic which I have touched on elsewhere I think I may very boldly object to the Censures of any one past upon Works which he hath not himself read Such Censurers as these whether they speak from their own Guess or Suspicion or from the Report and Opinion of others may properly be said to slander the Reputation of the Book they condemn  Such may likewise be suspected of deserving this Character who without assigning any particular Faults condemn the whole in general deformatory Terms such as vile dull dad Stuff  c  and particularly by the Use of the Monosyllable LOW a Word which becomes the Mouth of no Critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE  Again tho' there may be some Faults justly assigned in the Work yet if those are not in the most essential Parts or if they are compensated by greater Beauties it will savour rather of the Malice of a Slanlerer than of the Judgment of a true Critic to pass  severe Sentence upon the whole merely on account of some vicious Part This is directly contrary to he Sentiments of  Horace  Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis  Offendor maculis quas aut incuria fudit  Aut humana parum cavit natura  But where the Beauties more in Number shine  I am not angry when a casual Line  That with some trivial Faults unequal flows  A careless Hand or human Frailty shows  Mr FRANCIS  For as  Martial  says  Aliter non fit Avite Liber▪ No Book can be otherwise composed  All Beauty o  Character as well as of Countenance and indeed o  every Thing human is to be tried in this Manner Cruel indeed would it be if such a Work as this History which hath employed some Thousands of Hours in the composing should be liable to be condemned because some particular Chapter or perhaps Chapters may be obnoxious to very just and sensible Objections And yet nothing is more common than the most rigorous Sentence upon Books supported by some Objections which if they were rightly taken and that they are not always do by no Means go to the Merit of the whole In the Theatre especially a single Expression which doth not coincide with the Taste of the Audience or with any individual Critic of that Audience is sure to be hissed and one Scene which should be disapproved would hazard the whole Piece To write within such severe Rules as these is as impossible as to live up to some splenetic Opinions and if we judge according to the Sentiments of some Critics and of some Christians no Author will be saved in this World and no Man in the next  CHAP II  The Adventures which  Sophia  met with after her leaving  Upton  OUR History just before it was obliged to turn about and travel backwards had mentioned the  Departure of  Sophia  and her Maid from the Inn we  hall now therefore pursue the Steps of that lovely  reature and leave her unworthy Lover a little longer to bemoan his IllLuck or rather his Ill Con  uct  Sophia  having directed her Guide to travel through  yeRoads cross the Country they now passed the  vern  and had scarce got a Mile from the Inn when  e young Lady looking behind her saw several Horses coming after on full Speed This greatly  armed her Fears and she called to the Guide to  ut on as fast as possible  He immediately obeyed her and away they rode full Gallop But the faster they went the faster  ere they followed and as the Horses behind were  omewhat swifter than those before so the former  ere at length overtaken A happy Circumstance  r poor  Sophia  whose Fears joined to her Fatigue  ad almost overpowered her Spirits but she was now  stantly relieved by a female Voice that greeted  er in the softest Manner and with the utmost Civi  y This Greeting  Sophia  as soon as she could  ecover her Breath with like Civility and with the  ighest Satisfaction to herself returned  The Travellers who joined  Sophia  and who had  iven her such Terror consisted like her own Company of two Females and a Guide The two Par  es proceeded three full Miles together before any  ne offered again to open their Mouths when our  eroine having pretty well got the better of her Fear  ut yet being somewhat surprized that the other still  ontinued to attend her as she pursued no great Road  d had already passed through several Turnings  costed the strange Lady in a most obliging Tone  d said  'She was very happy to find they were both travelling the same Way'  The other who  e a Ghost only wanted to be spoke to readily  swered  'That the Happiness was entirely hers  that she was a perfect Stranger in that Country and was so overjoyed at meeting a Companion o  her own Sex that she had perhaps been guilty o  an Impertinence which required great Apology i  keeping Pace with her'  More Civilities passe  between these two Ladies for Mrs  Honour  had no  given Place to the fine Habit of the Stranger an  had fallen into the Rear But tho'  Sophia  had grea  Curiosity to know why the other Lady continued  travel on through the same ByeRoads with herself nay tho' this gave her some Uneasiness yet Fea  or Modesty or some other Consideration restraind her from asking the Question  The strange Lady now laboured under a Difficult which appears almost below the Dignity of History  mention Her Bonnet had been blown from h  Head not less than five Times within the lastt Mile  nor could she come at any Ribbon or Handkerchi  to tye it under her Chin When  Sophia  was informed of this she immediately supplied her with a Hand+kerchief for this Purpose which while she was pu  ling from her Pocket she perhaps too much neglected the Management of her Horse for the Beast no  unluckily making a false Step fell upon his Four Legs and threw his Fair Rider from his Back  Tho'  Sophia  came Head foremost to the Groun  she happily received not the least Damage and t  same Circumstances which had perhaps contributed her Fall now preserved her from Confusion  the Lane which they were then passing was narr  and very much overgrown with Trees so that t  Moon could here afford very little Light and w  moreover at present so obscured in a Cloud tha  was almost perfectly dark By these Mens t  young Lady's Modesty which was extremely delica  escaped as free from Injury as her Limbs and she w  once more reinstated in her Saddle having receiv  no other Harm than a little Fright by her Fall  Daylight at length appeared in its full Lustre and  ow the two Ladies who were riding over a Common Side by Side looking stedfastly at each other at  he same Moment both their Eyes became fixed both their Horses stopt and both speaking together with  qual Joy pronounced the one the Name of  Sophia  e other that of  Harriet  This unexpected Encounter surprized the Ladies  uch more than I believe it will the sagacious Reader who must have imagined that the strange Lady could  no other than Mrs  Fitzpatrick  the Cousin of Miss  Western  whom we beforementioned to have sallied  om the Inn a few Minutes after her  So great was the Surprize and Joy which these two  ousins conceived at this Meeting for they had for  erly been most intimate Acquaintance and Friends  d had long lived together with their Aunt  Western  at it is impossible to recount half the Congratulations  hich passed between them before either asked a ve  natural Question of the other namely whither she as going  This at last however came first from Mrs  Fitzpatrick  but easy and natural as the Question may  m  Sophia  found it difficult to give it a very ready  tain Answer She begged her Cousin therefore suspend all Curiosity till they arrived at some Inn which I suppose' says she 'can hardly be far  istant and believe me  Harriet  I suspend as much Curiosity on my Side for indeed I believe our Astonishment is pretty equal  The Conversation which passed between these La  s on the Road was I apprehend little worth re  ng and less certainly was that between the two  aitingwomen For they likewise began to pay  ir Compliments to each other As for the Guides  y were debarred from the Pleasure of Discourse one being placed in the Van and the other oblig  to bring up the Rear  In this Posture they travelled many Hours till they came into a wide and wellbeaten Road which as they turned to the Right soon brought them to a very fair promising Inn where they all alighted But so fatigued was  Sophia  that as she had sat her Horse during the last five or six Miles with great Difficulty so was she now incapable of dismounting from him without Assistance This the Landlord who had hold of her Horse presently perceiving offered to lift her in his Arms from her Saddle and she too readily accepted the Tender of his Service Indeed Fortune seems to have resolved to put  Sophia  to the Blush that Day and the second malicious Attempt succeeded better than the first for my Land+lord had no sooner received the young Lady in hi  Arms than his Feet which the Gout had lately very severely handled gave way and down he tumbled but at the same Time with no less Dexterity than Gallantry contrived to throw himself under hi  charming Burthen so that he alone received any Bruise from the Fall for the greatest Injury which happened to  Sophia  was a violent Shock given to he  Modesty by an immoderate Grin which at her rising from the Ground she observed in the Countenance of most of the ByeStanders This made her suspect what had really happened and what we shall not here relate for the Indulgence of those Reader who are capable of laughing at the Offence given to a young Lady's Delicacy Accidents of this Kind w  have never regarded in a comical Light nor wil  we scruple to say that he must have a very inadequate Idea of the Modesty of a beautiful young Wo+man who would wish to sacrifice it to so paultry Satisfaction as can arise from Laughter  This Fright and Shock joined to the violent Fatigue which both her Mind and Body had undergone al+most overcame the excellent Constitution of  Sophia  an  she had scarce Strength sufficient to totter into the  n leaning on the Arm of her Maid Here she was no sooner seated than she called for a Glass of Water but Mrs  Honour  very judiciously in my Opinion changed it into a Glass of Wine  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  hearing from Mrs  Honour  that  Sophia  had not been in Bed during the twolast Nights and observing her to look very pale and wan with her Fatigue earnestly entreated her to refresh herself with some Sleep She was yet a Stranger to her History or her Apprehensions but had she known both she would have given the same Advice for Rest was vi  bly necessary for her and their long Journey through  yeRoads so entirely removed all Danger of Pursuit  hat she was herself perfectly easy on that Account  Sophia  was easily prevailed on to follow the Counsel of her Friend which was heartily seconded by  er Maid Mrs  Fitzpatrick  likewise offered to bear  er Cousin Company which  Sophia  with much Complaisance accepted  The Mistress was no sooner in Bed than the Maid  repared to follow her Example She began to make many Apologies to her Sister  Abigail  for leaving her  lone in so horrid a Place as an Inn but the other  opt her short being as well inclined to a Nap as herself and desired the Honour of being her Bed  ellow  Sophia  's Maid agreed to give her a Share of  er Bed but put in her Claim to all the Honour So  fter many Curt'sies and Compliments to Bed toge  er went the Waitingwomen as their Mistresses  d done before them  It was usual with my Landlord as indeed it is with  e whole Fraternity to enquire particularly of all  oachmen Footmen Postboys and others into the  ames of all his Guests what their Estate was and  here it lay It cannot therefore be wondered at  at the many particular Circumstances which attend  our Travellers and especially their retiring all to  Sleep at so extraordinary and unusual an Hour as ten in the Morning should excite his Curiosity As soon therefore as the Guides entered the Kitchen he began to examine who the Ladies were and whence they came but the Guides tho' they faithfully related all they knew gave him very little Satisfaction On the contrary they rather enflamed his Curiosity than extinguished it  This Landlord had the Character among all his Neighbours of being a very sagacious Fellow He was thought to see farther and deeper into Things than any Man in the Parish the Parson himself not excepted Perhaps his Look had contributed not a little to procure him this Reputation for there was in this something wonderfully wise and significant especially when he had his Pipe in his Mouth which indeed he seldom was without His Behaviour likewise greatly assisted in promoting the Opinion of his Wisdom In his Deportment he was solemn if not sullen and when he spoke which was seldom he always delivered himself in a slow Voice and though his Sentences were short they were still interrupted with many Hum's and Ha's Ay Ays and other Expletives So that though he accompanied his Words with certain explanatory Gestures such as shaking or nodding the Head or pointing with his Forefinger he generally left his Hearers to understand more than he expressed nay he commonly gave them a Hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to disclose This last Circumstance alone may indeed very well account for his Character of Wisdom since Men are strangely inclined to worship what they do not understand A grand Secret upon which severa  Imposers on Mankind have totally relied for the Success of their Frauds  This politic Person now taking his Wife aside asked her 'What she thought of the Ladies lately 'arrived' 'Think of them' said the Wife 'why  what should I think of them' 'I know' answered he 'what I think The Guides tell strange Stories One pretends to be come from  Gloucester  and the other from  Upton  and neither of them for what I can find can tell whither they are going But what People ever travel across the Country from  Upton  hither especially to  London  And one of the MaidServants before she alighted from her Horse asked if this was not the  London  Road Now I have put all these Circumstances together and whom do you think I have found them out to be' 'Nay answered she you know I never pretend to guess at your Discoveries''It is a good Girl' replied he chucking her under her Chin 'I must own you have always submitted to my Knowledge of these Matters Why then depend upon it mind what I saydepend upon it they are certainly some of the Rebel Ladies who they say travel with the young Chevalier and have taken a round about Way to escape the Duke's Army 'Husband quoth the Wife 'you have certainly hit it for one of them is drest as fine as any Princess and to be sure she looks for all the World like oneBut yet when I consider one Thing When you consider' cries the Landlord contemp  ously'Come pray let's hear what you consider'Why it is' answered the Wife that she is too humble to be any very great Lady for while our  Betty  was warming the Bed she called her nothing but Child and my Dear and Sweetheart and when  Betty  offered to pull off her Shoes and Stockings she would not suffer her saying she would not give her the trouble'  'Pugh answered the Husband This is nothing Dost think because you have seen some great Ladies rude and uncivil to Persons below them that none of them know how to behave themselves when they come before their inferiors  I think I know People of Fashion when I see them I think I do Did she not call for a Glass of Water when she came in Another Sort of Woman would have called for a Dram you know they would If she be not a Woman of very great Quality sell me for a Fool and I believe those who buy me will have a bad Bargain Now would a Woman of her Quality travel without a Footman unless upon some such extraordinary Occasion Nay to be sure Husband cries she you know these Matters better than I or most Folk'  I think I do know something said he  To be sure answered the the Wife 'the poor little Heart looked so piteous when she sat down in the Chair I protest I could not help having a Compassion for her almost as much as if she had been a poor Body But what's to be done Husband If an she be a Rebel I suppose you intend to betray her up to the Court Well she's a sweettempered goodhumoured Lady be she what she will and I shall hardly refrain from crying when I hear she is hanged or beheaded Pooh answered the HusbandBut as to what's to be done is not so easy a Matter to determine I hope before she goe  away we shall have the News of a Battle for i  the Chevalier should get the better she my gain u  Interest at Court and make our Fortunes without betraying her Why that's true replied the Wife and I heartily hope she will have it in her Power Certainly she's a sweet good Lady i  would go horribly against me to have her come to any Harm Pooh cries the Landlord Wo+men are always so tenderhearted Why you would not harbour Rebels would you No certainly answered the Wife and as for betraying her come what will on't Nobody can blame us It is what any body would do in our Case'  While our politic Landlord who had not we see undeservedly the Reputation of great Wisdom among  his Neighbours was engaged in debating this Matter with himself for he paid little Attention to the Opinion of his Wife News arrived that the Rebels had given the Duke the Slip and had got a Day's March towards  London  and soon after arrived a famous  Ja  ite  Squire who with great Joy in his Countenance shook the Landlord by the Hand saying All's our own Boy ten thousand honest  Frenchmen  are landed in  Suffolk  Old  England  for ever Ten thousand  French  my brave Lad I am going to tap away directly'  This News determined the Opinion of the wise Man and he resolved to make his Court to the young Lady when she arose for he had now he said discovered that she was no other than Madam  Jenny Cameron  herself  CHAP III  A very short Chapter in which however is a Sun a Moon a Star and an Angel  THE Sun for he keeps very good Hours at this Time of the Year had been some Time retired to rest when  Sophia  arose greatly refreshed by her Sleep which short as it was nothing but her extreme Fatigue could have occasioned for tho' she had told her Maid and perhaps herself too that she was perfectly easy when she left  Upton  yet it is certain her Mind was a little affected with that Malady which is attended with all the restless Symptoms of a Fever and is perhaps the very distemper which Physicians mean if they mean any thing by the Fever on the Spirits  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  likewise left her Bed at the same Time and having summoned her Maid immediately dressed herself She was really a very pretty Woman and had she been in any other Company but that of  Sophia  might have been thought beautiful but when Mrs  Honour  of her own accord attended for her Mistress would not suffer her to be awaked  and had equipped our Heroine the Charms of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  who had performed the Office of the Morning Star and had preceded greater Glories shared the Fate of that Star and were totally eclipsed the Moment those Glories shone forth  Perhaps  Sophia  never looked more beautiful than she did at this Instant We ought not therefore to condemn the Maid of the Inn for her Hyperb  le who when she descended after having lighted the Fire declared and ratified it with an Oath that if ever there was an Angel upon Earth she was now above Stairs  Sophia  had acquainted her Cousin with her Design to go to  London  and Mrs  Fitzpatrick  had agreed to accompany her for the arrival of her Husband a  Upton  had put an End to her Design of going to  Bath  or to her Aunt  Western  They had therefore no sooner finished their Tea than  Sophia  proposed to se  out the Moon then shining extremely bright and as for the Frost she defied it nor had she any of those Apprehensions which many young Ladies would have felt at travelling by Night for she had as we have before observed some little Degree of natural Courage and this her present Sensations which bordered somewhat on Despair greatly encreased Besides as she had already travelled twice with Safety by the Light of the Moon she was the better emboldened to trust to it a third Time  The Disposition of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  was more t  morous for tho' the greater Terrors had conquere  the less and the Presence of her Husband had drive  her away at so unseasonable an Hour from  Upton  ye  being now arrived at a Place where she thought herself safe from his Pursuit these lesser Terrors of know not what operated so strongly that she earnestly entreated her Cousin to stay till the next Morning an  not expose herself to the Dangers of travelling by Night  Sophia  who was yielding to an Excess when sh  could neither laugh nor reason her Cousin out of these  Apprehensions at last gave Way to them Perhaps indeed had she known of her Father's Arrival at  Upton  it might have been more difficult to have persuaded her for as to  Jones  she had I am afraid no great Horror at the Thoughts of being overtaken by him nay to confess the Truth I believe she rather wished than feared it though I might honestly enough have concealed this Wish from the Reader as it was one of those secret spontaneous Emotions of the Soul to which the Reason is often a Stranger  When our young Ladies had determined to remain all that Evening in their Inn they were attended by the Landlady who desired to know what their Ladyships would be pleased to eat Such Charms were there in the Voice in the Manner and in the affable Deportment of  Sophia  that she ravished the Landlady to the highest Degree and that good Woman concluding that she had attended  Jenny Cameron  became in a Moment a staunch  Jacobite  and wished heartily well to the young Pretender's Cause from the great sweetness and Affability with which she had been treated by his supposed Mistress  The two Cousins began now to impart to each other their reciprocal Curiosity to know what extraordinary Accidents on both sides occasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting At last Mrs  Fitzpatrick  having obtained of  Sophia  a Promise of communicating likewise in her Turn began to relate what the Reader if he is desirous to know her History may read in the ensuing Chapter  CHAP IV  The History of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  MRS  Fitzpatrick  after a Silence of a few Moments fetching a deep Sigh thus began  'It is natural to the Unhappy to feel a secret Concern in recollecting those Periods of their Lives  which have been most delightful to them The Remembrance of past Pleasures affects us with a kind of tender Grief like what we suffer for departed Friends and the Ideas of both may be said to haunt our Imaginations'  'For this Reason I never reflect without Sorrow on those Days the happiest far of my Life which we spent together when both were under the Care of my Aunt  Western  Alas why are Miss  Graveairs  and Miss  Giddy  no more You remember I am sure when we knew each other by no other Names Indeed you gave me the latter Appellation with too just Cause I have since experienced how much I deserved it You my  Sophia  was always my Superior in every thing and I heartily hope you will be so in your Fortune I shall never forget the wise and matronly Advice you once gave me when I lamented being disappointed of a Ball though you could not be then fourteen Years oldO my  Sophy  how blest must have been my Situation when I could think such a Disappointment a Misfortune and when indeed it was the greatest I had ever known'  'And yet my dear  Harriet'  answered  Sophia  it was then a serious Matter with you Comfort yourself therefore with thinking that whatever you now lament may hereafter appear as triffling and contemptible as a Ball would at this Time'  'Alas my  Sophia'  replied the other Lady 'you yourself will think otherwise of my present Situation for greatly must that tender Heart be altered if my Misfortunes do not draw many a Sigh nay many a Tear from you The Knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from relating what I am convinced will so much affect you'  Here Mrs  Fitzpatrick  stopt till at the repeated Entreaties o  Sophia  she proceeded  'Though you must have heard much of my Marriage yet as Matters may probably have been mis  represented I will set out from the very Commencement of my unfortunate Acquaintance with my Husband which was at  Bath  soon after you' left my Aunt and returned home to your Father  'Among the gay young Fellows who were at this Season at  Bath  Mr  Fitzpatrick  was one He was handsome degagé extremely gallant and in his Dress exceeded most others In short my Dear if you was unluckily to see him now I could describe him no better than by telling you he was the very Reverse of every Thing which he is For he hath rusticated himself so long that he is become an absolute wild  Irishman  But to proceed in my Story the Qualifications which he then possessed so well recommended him that though the People of Quality at this Time lived separate from the rest of the Company and excluded them from all their Parties Mr  Fitzpatrick  found Means to gain Admittance It was perhaps no easy Matter to avoid him for he required very little or no Invitation and as being handsome and genteel he found it no difficult Matter to ingratiate himself with the Ladies so he having frequently drawn his Sword the Men did not care publickly to affront him Had it not been for some such Reason I believe he would have been soon expelled by his own Sex for surely he had no strict Title to be preferred to the  English  Gentry nor did they seem inclined to shew him any extraordinary Favour They all abused him behind his Back which might probably proceed from Envy for he was well received' and very particularly distinguished by the Women  'My Aunt tho' no Person of Quality herself as she had always lived about the Court was enrolled in that Party For by whatever Means you get into the Polite Circle when you are once there it is sufficient Merit for you that you are there This Observation young as you was you could scarce  avoid making from my Aunt who was free or reserved with all People just as they had more o  ' less of this Merit  'And this Merit I believe it was which principally recommended Mr  Fitzpatrick  to her Favour In which he so well succeeded that he was always one of her private Parties Nor was h  backward in returning such Distinction for he soon grew so very particular in his Behaviour to her tha  the Scandal Club first began to take Notice of it and the better disposed Persons made a Match between them For my own Part I confess I made no Doubt but that his Designs were strictly honourable as the Phrase is that is to rob a Lady of he Fortune by Way of Marriage My Aunt was conceived neither young enough nor handsome enough to attract much wicked Inclination but' she had matrimonial Charms in great Abundance  'I was the more confirmed in this Opinion from the extraordinary Respect which he shewed to my self from the first Moment of our Acquaintance This I understood as an attempt to lessen if possible that Disinclination which my Interest might be supposed to give me towards the Match and I know no but in some Measure it had that Effect for as I was well contented with my own Fortune and of all People the least a Slave to interested Views so could not be violently the Enemy of a Man with whose Behaviour to me I was greatly pleased and the more so as I was the only Object of such Respect for he behaved at the same Time to many' Women of Quality without any Respect at all  'Agreeable as this was to me he soon changed i  into another Kind of Behaviour which was perhaps more so He now put on much Softness and Tenderness and languished and sighed abundantly At Times indeed whether from Art or Nature will not determine he gave his usual loose to Gaye  ty and Mirth but this was always in general Company and with other Women for even in a Country Dance when he was not my Partner he became grave and put on the softest Look imaginable the Moment he approached me Indeed he was in all Things so very particular towards me that I must have been blind not to have discovered it And and and    'And you was more pleased still my dear  Harriet'  cries  Sophia  'you need not be ashamed added she sighing 'for sure there are irresistible Charms in Tenderness which too many Men are able to affect'  'True' answered her Cousin 'Men who in all other Instances want common 'Sense are very  Machiavels  in the Art of Loving I wish I did not know an InstanceWell Scandal now began to be as busy with me as it had before been with my Aunt and some good Ladies did not scruple to affirm that Mr  Fitzpatrick  had an Intrigue with us both'  'But what may seem astonishing my Aunt never saw nor in the least seemed to suspect that which was visible enough I believe from both our Behaviours One would indeed think that Love quite puts out the Eyes of an old Woman In Fact they so greedily swallow the Addresses which are made to them that like an outragious Glutton they are not at Leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same Table This I have observed in more Cases than my own and this was so strongly verified by my Aunt that tho' she often found us together at her Return from the Pump the least canting Word of his pretending Impatience at her Absence effectually smothered all Suspicion One Artifice succeeded with her to Admiration This was his treating me like a little Child and never calling me by any other Name in her Presence but that of pretty Miss This indeed did him some Disservice with your humble Servant but I soon saw  through it especially as in her Absence he behaved to me as I have said in a different Manner However if I was not greatly disobliged by a Conduct of which I had discovered the Design I smarted very severely for it For my Aunt really conceived me to be what her Lover as she thought him called me and treated me in all Respects as a perfect Infant To say the Truth I wonder she had not insisted on my again wearing Leadingstrings'  'At last my Lover for so he was thought proper in a most solemn Manner to disclose a Secret which I had known long before He now placed all the Love which he had pretended to my Aunt to my Account He lamented the Encouragement she had given him in very pathetic Terms and made a high Merit of the tedious Hours in which he had undergone her ConversationWhat shall I tell you my dear  Sophia  Then I will confess the Truth I was pleased with my Man I was pleased with my Conquest To rival my Aunt delighted me to rival so many other Women charmed me In short I am afraid I did not behave as I should do even upon the very first DeclarationI wish I did not almost give him positive Encouragement before we parted'  'The  Bath  now talked loudly I might almost say roared against me Several young Women affected to shun my Acquaintance not so much perhaps from any real Suspicion as from a Desire of banishing me from a Company in which I too much engrossed their favourite Man And here I cannot omit expressing my Gratitude to the Kindness intended me by Mr  Nash  who took me one Day aside and gave me Advice which if I had followed I had been a happy Woman'  "Child" says he 'I am sorry to see the Familiarity which subsists between you and a Fellow who is altogether unworthy of you and I am afraid will prove your  Ruin As for your old stinking Aunt if it was to be no Injury to you and my pretty  Sophia Western  I assure you I repeat his Words I should be heartily glad that the Fellow was in Possession of all that belongs to her I never advise old Women For if they take it into their Heads to go to the Devil it is no more possible than worth while to keep them from him Innocence and Youth and Beauty are worthy a better Fate and I would save them from his Clutches Let me advise you therefore dear Child never suffer this Fellow to be particular with you again" 'Many more Things he said to me which I have now forgotton and indeed I attended very little to them at that Time For Inclination contradicted all he said and besides I could not be persuaded that Women of Quality would condescend to Familiarity with such a Person as he described'  'But I am afraid my Dear I shall tire you with a Detail of so many minute Circumstances To be concise therefore imagine me married imagine me with my Husband at the Feet of my Aunt and then imagine the maddest Woman in  Bedlam  in a raving Fit and your Imagination will suggest to you no more than what really happened'  'The very next Day my Aunt left the Place partly to avoid seeing Mr  Fitzpatrick  or my self and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one else for tho' I am told she hath since denied every thing stoutly I believe she was then a little confounded at her Disappointment Since that Time I have written to her many Letters but never could obtain an Answer which I must own sits somewhat the heavier as she herself was tho' undesignedly the Occasion of all my Sufferings For had it not been under the Colour of paying his Addresses to her Mr  Fitzpatrick  would never have found sufficient Opportunities to have engaged my Heart which  in other Circumstances I still flatter myself would not have been an easy Conquest to such a Person Indeed I believe I should not have erred so grosly in my Choice if I had relied on my own Judgment but I trusted totally to the Opinion of others and very foolishly took the Merit of a Man for granted whom I saw so universally well received by the Women What is the Reason my Dear that we who have Understandings equal to the wisest and greatest of the other Sex so often make Choice of the silliest Fellows for Companions and Favourites It raises my Indignation to the highest Pitch to reflect on the Numbers of Women of Sense who have been undone by Fools'  Here she paused a Moment but  Sophia  making no Answer she proceeded as in the next Chapter  CHAP V  In which the History of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  is continued  'WE remained at  Bath  no longer than a Fortnight after our Wedding For as to any Reconciliation with my Aunt there were no Hopes and of my Fortune not one Farthing could be touched till I was at Age of which I now wanted more than two Years My Husband therefore was resolved to set out for  Ireland  against which I remonstrated very earnestly and insisted on a Promise which he had made me before our Marriage that I should never take this Journey against my Consent and indeed I never intended to consent to it nor will any Body I believe blame me for that Resolution but this however I never mentioned to my Husband and petitioned only for the Reprieve of a Month but he had fixed the Day and to that Day he obstinately adhered'  'The Evening before our Departure as we were disputing this Point with great Eagerness on both  Sides he started suddenly from his Chair and left me abruptly saying he was going to the Rooms He was hardly out of the House when I saw a Paper lying on the Floor which I suppose he had carelesly pulled from his Pocket together with his Handkerchief This Paper I took up and finding it to be a Letter I made no Scruple to open and read it and indeed I read it so often that I can repeat it to you almost Word for Word This then was he Letter'  To Mr  Brian Fitzpatrick  Sir  YOURS received and am surprized you should use me in this Manner as have never seen any of your Cash unless for one Linsey Woolsey Coat and your Bill now is upwards of  l  Consider Sir how often you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this Lady and t'other Lady but I can neither live on Hopes or Promises nor will my Woollendraper take any such in Payment You tell me you are secure of having either the Aunt or the Niece and that you might have married the Aunt before this whose Jointure you say is immense but that you prefer the Niece on account of her ready Money Pray Sir take a Fool's Advice for once and marry the first you can get You will pardon my offering my Advice as you know I sincerely wish you well Shall draw on you  per  next Post in favour of Messieurs  John Drugget  and Company at fourteen Days which doubt not your honouring and am  Sir  Your humble Servant SAM COSGRAVE  'This was the Letter Word for Word Guess my dear Girl guess how this Letter affected me  You prefer the Niece on account of her Ready Money  If every one of these Words had been a Dagger I could with Pleasure have stabbed them into his Heart but I will not recount my frantic Behaviour on the Occasion I had pretty well spent my Tears before his return home but sufficient Remains of them appeared in my swollen Eyes He threw himself sullenly into his Chair and for a long Time we were both silent At length in a haughty Tone he said "I hope Madam your Servants have packed up all your Things for the Coach will be ready by Six in the Morning" My Patience was totally subdued by this Provocation and I answered No Sir there is a Letter still remains unpacked and then throwing it on the Table I fell to upbraiding him with the most bitter Language I could invent'  'Whether Guilt or Shame or Prudence restrained him I cannot say but tho' he is the most passionate of Men he exerted no Rage on this Occasion He endeavoured on the contrary to pacify me by the most gentle Means He swore the Phrase in the Letter to which I principally objected was not his nor had he ever written any such He owned indeed the having mentioned his Marriage and that Preference which he had given to myself but denied with many Oaths the having assigned any such Reason And he excused the having mentioned any such Matter at all on account of the Straits he was in for Money arising he said from his having too long neglected his Estate in  Ireland  And this he said which he could not bear to discover to me was the only Reason of his having so strenuously insisted on our Journey He then used several endearing Expressions and concluded by a very fond Caress and many violent Protestations of Love'  'There was one Circumstance which tho' he did not appeal to it had much Weight with me in  his Favour and that was the Word Jointure in the Taylor's Letter whereas my Aunt never had been married and this Mr  Fizpatrick  well knewAs I imagined therefore that the Fellow must have inserted this of his own Head or from Hearsay I persuaded myself he might have ventured likewise on that odious Line on no better Authority What Reasoning was this my Dear Was I not an Advocate rather than a JudgeBut why do I mention such a Circumstance as this or appeal to it for the Justification of my ForgivenessIn short had he been guilty of twenty Times as much half the Tenderness and Fondness which he used would have prevailed on me to have forgiven him I now made no farther Objections to our setting out which we did the next Morning and in a little more than a Week arrived at the Seat of Mr  Fitzpatrick  '  'Your Curiosity will excuse me from relating any Occurrences which past during our Journey For it would indeed be highly disagreeable to travel it over again and no less so to you to travel it over with me'  'This Seat then is an ancient MansionHouse If I was in one of those merry Humours in which you have so often seen me I could describe it to you ridiculously enough It looked as if it had been formerly inhabited by a Gentleman Here was Room enough and not the less Room on account of the Furniture For indeed there was very little in it An old Woman who seemed coeval with the Building and greatly resembled her whom  Chamont  mentions in the  Orphan  received us at the Gate and in a Howl scarce human and to me unintelligible welcomed her Master home In short the whole Scene was so gloomy and melancholy that it threw my Spirits into the lowest Dejection which my Husband discerning instead of relieving encreased by two or three malicious Observations  There are good Houses Madam" says he "  you find in other Places besides  England  b  perhaps you had rather be in a dirty Lodging  Bath  '  'Happy my Dear is the Woman who in an  State of Life hath a cheerful goodnatured Companion to support and comfort her but why do reflect on happy Situations only to aggravate m  own Misery My Companion far from clearing up the Gloom of Solitude soon convinced me that I must have been wretched with him in an  Place and in any Condition In a Word he wa  a surly Fellow a Character you have perhaps never seen For indeed no Woman ever sees it exemplified but in a Father a Brother or a Husband and tho' you have a Father he is not of that Character This surly Fellow had formerly appeared to me the very Reverse and so he did still t  every other Person Good Heaven how is it possible for a Man to maintain a constant Lie in h  Appearance abroad and in Company and to conten  himself with shewing disagreeable Truth only a home Here my Dear they make themselves Amends for the uneasy Restraint which they put o  their Tempers in the World for I have observe  the more merry and gay and goodhumoured m  Husband hath at any Time been in Company th  more sullen and morose he was sure to be at ou  next private Meeting How shall I describe hi  Barbarity To my Fondness he was cold and insible My little comical Ways which you m  Sophy  and which others have called so agreeable he treated with Contempt In my most seriou  Moments he sung and whistled and whenever was thoroughly dejected and miserable he was angry and abused me for though he was never pleased with my good Humour nor ascribed it to my Satisfaction in him yet my low Spirits always of  fended him and those he imputed to my Repentance of having as he said married an  Irishman  '  'You will easily conceive my dear  Graveairs  I ask your Pardon I really forgot myself that when a Woman makes an imprudent Match in the Sense of the World that is when she is not an arrant Prostitute to pecuniary Interest she must necessarily have some Inclination and Affection for her Man You will as easily believe that this Affection may possibly be lessened nay I do assure you Contempt will wholly eradicate it This Contempt I now began to entertain for my Husband whom I now discover to beI must use the Expressionan errant Blockhead Perhaps you will wonder I did not make this Discovery long before but Women will suggest a thousand Excuses to themselves for the Folly of those they like Besides give me Leave to tell you it requires a most penetrating Eye to discern a Fool through the Disguises of Gayety and Goodbreeding'  'It will be easily imagined that when I once despised my Husband as I confess to you I soon did I must consequently dislike his Company and indeed I had the Happiness of being very little troubled with it for our House was now most elegantly furnished our Cellars well stocked and Dogs and Horses provided in great Abundance As my Gentleman therefore entertained his Neighbours with great Hospitality so his Neighbours resorted to him with great Alacrity and Sports and Drinking consumed so much of his Time that a small Part of his Conversation that is to say of his Illhumours fell to my Share'  'Happy would it have been for me if I could as easily have avoided all other disagreeable Company but alas I was confined to some which constantly tormented me and the more as I saw no Prospect of being relieved from them These Companions  were my own racking Thoughts which plagued and in a Manner haunted me Night and Day I this Situation I past through a Scene the Horror of which can neither be painted nor imagined Think my Dear figure if you can to yourself what I must have undergone I became a Mother by the Man I scorned hated and detested I we  through all the Agonies and Miseries of a Lyingi  ten Times more painful in such a Circumstance than the worst Labour can be when one endures for a Man one loves in a Desert or rather indeed a Scene of Riot and Revel without a Friend without a Companion or without any of those agreeable Circumstances which often alleviate and perhaps sometimes more than compensate the Sufferings of our Sex at this Season'  CHAP VI  In which the Mistake of the Landlord throws  Sophia  into a dreadful Consternation  MRS  Fitzpatrick  was proceeding in her Narrative when she was interrupted by the Entrance of Dinner greatly to the Concern of  Sophia  For the Misfortunes of her Friend had raised her Anxiety and left her no Appetite but what Mrs  Fitzpatrick  was to satisfy by her Relation  The Landlord now attended with a Plate under hi  Arm and with the same Respect in his Countenance and Address which he would have put on had th  Ladies arrived in a Coach and Six  The married Lady seemed less affected with he own Misfortunes than was her Cousin For the former eat very heartily whereas the latter could hardl  swallow a Morsel  Sophia  likewise shewed mor  Concern and Sorrow in her Countenance than appeared in the other Lady who having observed the  Symptoms in her Friend begged her to be comforted  saying 'Perhaps all may yet end better than either you or I expect  Our Landlord thought he had now an Opportunity  o open his Mouth and was resolved not to omit it I am sorry Madam' cries he 'that your Ladyship can't eat for to be sure you must be hungry after so long fasting I hope your Ladyship is not uneasy at any Thing For as Madam there says all may end better than any body expects A Gentleman who was here just now brought excellent News and perhaps some Folks who have given other Folks the slip may get to  London  before they are overtaken and if they do I make no Doubt but they will find People who will be very ready to receive them  All Persons under the Apprehension of Danger  onvert whatever they see and hear into the Objects of that Apprehension  Sophia  therefore immediately  oncluded from the foregoing Speech that she was  nown and pursued by her Father She was now  ruck with the utmost Consternation and for a few  linutes deprived of the Power of Speech which  e no sooner recovered than she desired the Land  ord to send his Servants out of the Room and then  ddressing herself to him said 'I perceive Sir you know who we are but I beseech younay I am convinced if you have any Compassion or Goodness you will not betray us  'I betray your Ladyship' quoth the Landlord No and then he swore several hearty Oaths 'I would sooner be cut in ten thousand Pieces I hate all Treachery I I never betrayed any one in my Life yet and I am sure I shall not begin with so sweet a Lady as your Ladyship All the World would very much blame me if I should since it will be in your Ladyship's Power so shortly to reward me My Wife can Witness for me I knew  your Ladyship the Moment you came into the House I said it was your Honour before I lifted you from your Horse and I shall carry the Bruises I got in your Ladyship's Service to the Grave but what signified that as long as I saved your Ladyship To be sure some People this Morning would have thought of getting a Reward but no such▪ Thought ever entered into my Head I would sooner starve than take any Reward for betraying your Ladyship'  'I promise you Sir says  Sophia  if it be ever in my Power to reward you you shall not lose by your Generosity'  'Alackaday Madam' answered the Landlord in your Ladyship's Power Heaven put it as much into your Will I am only afraid your Honour will forget such a poor Man as an Innkeeper but if your Ladyship should not I hope you will remember what Reward I refusedrefused  that is I would have refused and to be sure it may be called refusing for I might have had it certainly and to be sure you might have been in some Housesbut for my Part I would not methinks for the World have your Ladyship wrong me so much as to imagine I ever thought of betraying you even before I heard the good News What News pray' says  Sophia  somewhat eagerly'  'Hath not your Ladyship heard it then' cries the Landlord nay like enough For I heard it only a few Minutes ago and if I had never heard it may the Devil fly away with me this Instant if I would have betrayed your Honour no if I would may IHere he subjoined several dreadful Execrations which  Sophia  at last interrupted and begged to know what he meant by the News'  He was going to answer when Mrs  Honour  came running into the Room all pale and breathless and cried out 'Madam  we are all undone all ruined they are come they are come' These Words almost froze up the  ood of  Sophia  but Mrs  Fitzpatrick  asked  Ho  ur  who are come'Who answered she why the  French  several hundred thousands of them are landed and we shall be all murdered and ravished'  As a Miser who hath in some wellbuilt City a Cottage value twenty Shillings when at a Distance  e is alarmed with the News of a Fire turns pale and  embles at his Loss but when he finds the beau  ful Palaces only are burnt and his own Cottage retains safe he comes instantly to himself and smiles this good Fortune Or as for we dislike something  the former Simile the tender Mother when ter  fied with the Apprehension that her darling Boy is towned is struck senseless and almost dead with Consternation but when she is told that little Master  safe and the  Victory  only with twelve hundred  ave Men gone to the Bottom Life and Sense again  eturn maternal Fondness enjoys the sudden Relief  rom all its Fears and the general Benevolence which a another Time would have deeply felt the dreadful  astrophe lies fast asleep in her Mind  So  Sophia  than whom none was more capable of  derly feeling the general Calamity of her Country  nd such immediate Satisfaction from the Relief  f those Terrors she had of being overtaken by her  ther that the Arrival of the  French  scarce made my Impression on her She gently chid her Maid  the Fright into which she had thrown her and  'she was glad it was no worse for that she had feared somebody else was come'  'Ay ay' quoth the Landlord smiling 'her Ladyship knows better things she knows the  French  are our very best Friends and come over hither only for our good They are the People who are to make old  England  flourish again I warrant  her Honour thought the Duke was coming  and that was enough to put her into a Fright I was going to tell your Ladyship the NewsHis Honour's Majesty Heaven bless him hath given the Duke the slip and is marching as fast as he can to  London  and ten thousand  French  are landed to join him on the Road'  Sophia  was not greatly pleased with this News nor with the Gentleman who related it but as she still imagined he knew her for she could not possibly have any Suspicion of the real Truth she durst no shew any Dislike And now the Landlord having removed the Cloth from the Table withdrew but at his Departure frequently repeated his Hopes of being remembered hereafter  The Mind of  Sophia  was not at all easy under the Supposition of being known at this House for she still applied to herself many Things which the Landlord had addressed to  Jenny Cameron  she therefore ordered her Maid to pump out of him by what Means he had become acquainted with her Person and who had offered him the Reward for betraying her she likewise ordered the Horses to be in Readiness by four in the Morning at which Hour Mrs  Fitzpatrick  promised to bear her Company and then composing herself as well as she could she desired that Lady to continue her Story  CHAP VII  In which Mrs  Fitzpatrick  concludes her History  WHILE Mrs  Honour  in Pursuance of the Commands of her Mistress ordered a Bowl of Punch and invited my Landlord and Landlay to partake of it Mrs  Fitzpatrick  thus went on with her Relation  'Most of the Officers who were quartered at a Town in our Neighbourhood were of my Husband's  Acquaintance Among these was a Lieutenant a very pretty Sort of Man and who was married to a Woman who was so agreeable both in her Temper and Conversation that from our first knowing each other which was soon after my Lyingin we were almost inseparable Companions for I had the good Fortune to make myself equally agreeable to her'  'The Lieutenant who was neither a Sot nor a Sportsman was frequently of our Parties indeed he was very little with my Husband and no more than goodBreeding constrained him to be as he lived almost constantly at our House My Husband often expressed much dissatisfaction at the Lieutenant's preferring my Company to his he was very angry with me on that Account and gave me many a hearty Curse for drawing away his Companions saying "I ought to be dned for having spoiled one of the prettiest Fellows in the World by making a Milksop of him'  'You will be mistaken my dear  Sophia  if you imagine that the Anger of my Husband arose from my depriving him of a Companion for the Lieutenant was not a Person with whose Society a Fool could be pleased and if I should admit the Possibility of this so little Right had my Husband to place the Loss of his Companion to me that I am convinced it was my Conversation alone which induced him ever to come to the House No Child it was Envy the worst and most rancorous Kind of Envy the Envy of Superiority of Understanding The Wretch could not bear to see my Conversation preferred to his by a Man of whom he could not entertain the least Jealousy O my dear  Sophy  you are a Woman of Sense if you marry a Man as is most probable you will of less Capacity than yourself make frequent Trials of his  Temper before Marriage and see whether he can bear to submit to such a SuperiorityPromise me  Sophy  you will take this Advice for you will hereafter find its Importance' 'It is very likely I shall never marry at all' answered  Sophia  'I think at least I shall never marry a Man in whose Understanding I see any Defects before Marriage and I promise you I would rather give up my own than see any such afterwards''Give up your Understanding' replied Mrs  Fitzpatrick  'Oh fie Child I will not believe so meanly of you Every thing else I might myself be brought to give up but never this Nature would not have allotted this Superiority to the Wife in so many Instances if she intended we should have all surrendered it to the Husband This indeed Men of Sense never expect of us of which the Lieutenant I have just mentioned was one notable Example for tho' he had a very good Understanding he always acknowledged as was really true that his Wife had a better And this perhaps was one Reason of the Hatred my Tyrant bore her'  'Before he would be so governed by a Wife' he said especially such an ugly Bfor indeed she was not a regular Beauty but very agreeable and extremely genteel he would see all the Women upon Earth at the Devil which was a very usual Phrase with him'  He said 'he wondered what I could see in her to be so charmed with her Company since this Woman says he 'hath come among us there is an End of your beloved Reading which you pretended to like so much that you could not afford Time to return the Visits of the Ladies in this Country and I must confess I had been guilty of a little Rudeness this Way for the Ladies there are at least no better than the mere Country Ladies here and I think I need make no other  Excuse to you for declining any Intimacy with them'  'This Correspondence however continued a whole Year even all the while the Lieutenant was quartered in that Town for which I was contented to pay the Tax of being constantly abused in the Manner abovementioned by my Husband I mean when he was at home for he was frequently absent a Month at a Time at  Dublin  and once made a Journey of two Months to  London  in all which Journeys I thought it a very singular Happiness that he never once desired my Company nay by his frequent Censures on Men who could not travel as he phrased it without a Wife tied up to their Tail he sufficiently intimated that had I been never so desirous of accompanying him my Wishes would have been in vain but Heaven knows such Wishes were very far from my Thoughts'  'At length my Friend was removed from me and I was again left to my Solitude to the tormenting Conversation with my own Reflections and to apply to Books for my only Comfort I now read almost all Day longHow many Books do you think I read in three Months' 'I can't guess indeed Cousin' answered  Sophia'  Perhaps half a Score' 'Half a Score half a thousand Child' answered the other 'I read a good deal in  Daniel  's  English  History of  France  a great deal in  Plutarch  's Lives the  Atalantis Pope  's  Homer Dryden  's Plays  Chillingworth  the Countess  D' Anois  and  Lock  's Human Understanding'  'During this Interval I wrote three very supplicating and I thought moving Letters to my Aunt but as I received no Answer to any of them my Disdain would not suffer me to continue my Application'    Here she stopt and looking earnestly at  Sophia  said 'Methinks my Dear I read something in your Eyes which reproaches me of a  Neglect in another Place where I should have met with a kinder Return'  'Indeed dear  Harriet'  answered  Sophia  your Story is an Apology for any Neglect but indeed I feel that I have been guilty of a Remissness without so good an ExcuseYet pray proceed for I long tho' I tremble to hear the End'  Thus then Mrs  Fitzpatrick  resumed her Narrative  'My Husband now took a second Journey to  England  where he continued upwards of three Months During the greater Part of this Time I led a Life which nothing but having led a worse could make me think tolerable for perfect Solitude can never be reconciled to a social Mind like mine but when it relieves you from the Company of those you hate What added to my Wretchedness was the Loss of my little Infant Not that I pretend to have had for it that extravagant Tenderness of which I believe I might have been capable under other Circumstances but I resolved in every Instance to discharge the Duty of the tenderest Mother and this Care prevented me from feeling the Weight of that heaviest of all Things when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our Hands'  'I had spent full ten Weeks almost entirely by myself having seen no body all that Time except my Servants and a very few Visitors when a young Lady a Relation of my Husband came from a distant Part of  Ireland  to visit me She had staid once before a Week at my House and I then gave her a pressing Invitation to return for she was a very agreeable Woman and had improved good natural Parts by a proper Education Indeed she was to me a most welcome Guest'  'A few Days after her Arrival perceiving me in very low Spirits without enquiring the Cause which indeed she very well knew the young Lady fell to compassionating my Case She said 'Tho' Politeness  had prevented me from complaining of my Husband's Behaviour to his Relations yet they all were very sensible of it and felt great Concern upon that Account but none more than herself" and after some general Discourse on this Head which I own I could not forbear Countenancing at last after much previous Precaution and enjoined Concealment she communicated to me as a profound Secretthat my Husband kept a Mistress'  'You will certainly imagine I heard this News with the utmost InsensibilityUpon my Word if you do your Imagination will mislead you Contempt had not so kept down my Anger to my Husband but that Hatred rose again on this occasion What can be the Reason of this Are we so abominably selfish that we can be concerned at others having the Possession even of what we despise Or are we not rather abominably vain and is not this the greatest Injury done to our Vanity What think you  Sophia  '  'I don't know indeed' answered  Sophia  'I have never troubled myself with any of these deep Contemplations but I think the Lady did very ill in communicating to you such a Secret'  'And yet my Dear this Conduct is natural' replied Mrs  Fitzpatrick  'and when you have seen and read as much as myself you will acknowledge it to be so'  'I am sorry to hear it is natural' returned  Sophia  for I want neither Reading nor Experience to convince me that it is very dishonourable and very illnatur'd Nay it is surely as illbred to tell a Husband or Wife of the Faults of each other as to tell them of their own'  'Well' continued Mrs  Fitzpatrick  'my Husband at last returned and if I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts I hated him now more  than ever but I despised him rather less For certainly nothing so much weakens our Contempt as an Injury done to our Pride or our Vanity'  'He now assumed a Carriage to me so very different from what he had lately worn and so nearly resembling his Behaviour the first Week of our Marriage that had I now had any Spark of Love remaining he might possibly have rekindled my Fondness for him But though Hatred may succeed to Contempt and may perhaps get the better of it Love I believe cannot The Truth is the Passion of Love is too restless to remain conconted without the Gratification which it receives from its Object and one can no more be inclined to love without loving than we can have Eyes without seeing When a Husband therefore ceases to be the Object of this Passion it is most probable some other ManI say my dear if your Husband grows indifferent to youif you once come to despise himI saythat isif you have the Passion of Love in youLud I have bewildered myself sobut one is apt in these abstracted Considerations to lose the Concatenation of Ideas as Mr  Locke  saysIn short the Truth isIn short I scarce know what it is but as I was saying my Husband returned and his Behaviour at first greatly surprized me but he soon acquainted me with the Motive and taught me to account for it In a Word then he had spent and lost all the ready Money of my Fortune and as he could mortgage his own Estate no deeper he was now desirous to supply himself with Cash for his Extravagance by selling a little Estate of mine which he could not do without my Assistance and to obtain this Favour was the whole and sole Motive of all the Fondness which he now put on'  'With this I peremptorily refused to comply I told him and I told him truly that had I been possessed of the  Indies  at our first Marriage he might have commanded it all For it had been a constant Maxim with me that where a Woman disposes of her Heart she should always deposite her Fortune but as he had been so kind long ago to restore the former into my Possession I was resolved likewise to retain what little remained of the latter'  'I will not describe to you the Passion into which these Words and the resolute Air in which they were spoken threw him Nor will I trouble you with the whole Scene which succeeded between us Out came you may be well assured the Story of the Mistress and out it did come with all the Embellishments which Anger and Disdain could bestow upon it'  'Mr  Fitzatrick  seemed a little Thunderstruck with this and more confused than I had seen him tho' his Ideas are always confused enough Heaven knows He did not however endeavour to exculpate himself but took a Method which almost equally confounded me What was this but Recrimination He affected to be jealoushe may for ought I know be inclined enough to Jealousy in his natural Temper Nay he must have had it from Nature or the Devil must have put it into his Head For I defy all the World to cast a just Aspersion on my Character Nay the most scandalous Tongues have never dared censure my Reputation My Fame I thank Heaven hath been always as spotless as my Life and let Falshood itself accuse that if it dare No my dear  Graveairs  however provoked however ill treated however injured in my Love I have firmly resolved never to give the least Room for Censure on this AccountAnd yet my dear there are some  People so malicious some Tongues so venomous that no Innocence can escape them The most undesigned Word the most accidental Look the least Familiarity or most innocent Freedom will be misconstrued and magnified into I know not what by some People But I despise my dear  Graveairs  I despise all such Slander No such Malice I assure you ever gave me an uneasy Moment No no I promise you I am above all thatBut where was I O let me see I told you my Husband was jealousAnd of whom prayWhy of whom but the Lieutenant I mentioned to you before He was obliged to resort above a Year and more back to find an Object for this unaccountable Passion if indeed he really felt any such and was not an errant Counterfeit in order to abuse me'  'But I have tired you already with too many Particulars I will now bring my Story to a very speedy Conclusion In short then after many Scenes very unworthy to be repeated in which my Cousin engaged so heartily on my Side that Mr  Fitzpatrick  at last turned her out of Doors when he found I was neither to be soothed nor bullied into Compliance he took a very violent Method indeed Perhaps you will conclude he beat me but this tho' he hath approached very near to it he never actually did He confined me to my Room without suffering me to have either Pen Ink Paper or Book and a Servant every Day made my Bed and brought me my Food'  'When I had remained a Week under this Imprisonment he made me a Visit and with the Voice of a Schoolmaster or what is often much the same a Tyrant asked me "If I would yet comply" I answered very stoutly "That I would die first" Then so you shall and be dn'd" cries he for you shall never go alive out of this Room'  'Here I remained a Fortnight longer and to say the Truth my Constancy was almost subdued and I began to think of Submission when one Day in the Absence of my Husband who was gone abroad for some short Time by the greatest good Fortune in the World an Accident happenedIat a Time when I began to give Way to the utmost Despairevery Thing would be excusable at such a Timeat that very Time I receivedBut it would take up an Hour to tell you all ParticularsIn one Word then for I will not tire you with Circumstances Gold the common Key to all Padlocks opened my Door and set me at Liberty'  'I now made Haste to  Dublin  where I immediately procured a Passage to  England  and was proceeding to  Bath  in Order to throw myself into the Protection of my Aunt or of your Father or of any Relation who would afford it me My Husband overtook me last Night at the Inn where I lay and which you left a few Minutes before me but I had the good Luck to escape him and to follow you'  'And thus my Dear ends my History A tragical one I am sure it is to myself but perhaps I ought rather to apologize to you for its Dulness'  Sophia  heaved a deep Sigh and answered 'Indeed  Harriet  I pity you from my SoulBut what could you expect Why why would you marry an  Irishman'  'Upon my Word' replied her Cousin 'your Censure is unjust There are among the  Irish  Men of as much Worth and Honour as any among the  English  Nay to speak the Truth Generosity of Spirit is rather more common among them I have known some Examples there too of good Husbands and I believe these are not very plenty in  England  Ask me rather what I could expect when I married a Fool and I will tell you a solemn  Truth I did not know him to be so'    'Can no Man' said  Sophia  in a very low and altered Voice do you think make a bad Husband who is not a Fool'  'That' answered the other 'is too general a Negative but none I believe is so likely as a Fool to prove so Among my Acquaintance the silliest Fellows are the worst Husbands and I will venture to assert as a Fact that a Man of Sense rarely behaves very ill to a Wife who deserves very well'  CHAP VIII  A dreadful Alarm in the Inn with the Arrival of an unexpected Friend of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  SOPHIA  now at the Desire of her Cousin relatednot what follows but what hath gone before in this History For which reason the Reader will I suppose excuse me for not repeating it over again  One Remark however I cannot forbear making on her Narrative namely that she made no more mention of  Jones  from the Beginning to the End than if there had been no such Person alive This I will neither endeavour to account for nor to excuse Indeed if this may be called a Kind of Dishonesty it seems the more inexcusable from the apparent Openness and explicit Sincerity of the other LadyBut so it was  Just as  Sophia  arrived at the Conclusion of her Story there arrived in the Room where the two Ladies were sitting a Noise not unlike in Loudness to that of a Pack of Hounds just let out from their Kennel nor in Shrillness to Cats when caterwauling or to ScreechOwls or indeed more like for what Animal can resemble a human Voice to those Sounds which in the pleasant Mansions of that Gate which seems to derive its Name from a Duplicity of Tongues issue from the Mouths and sometimes  from the Nostrils of those fair River Nymphs yeleped of old the  Napaeae  or the  Naiades  in the vulgar Tongue translated OysterWenches For when instead of the antient Libations of Milk and Honey and Oil the rich Distillation from the JuniperBerry or perhaps from Malt hath by the early Devotion of their Votaries been poured forth into great Abundance should any daring Tongue with unhallowed License prophane i e depreciate the delicate fat  Milton  Oyster the Plaice sound and firm the Flounder as much alive as when in the Water the Shrimp as big as a Prawn the fine Cod alive but a few Hours ago or any other of the various Treasures which those Water Deities who fish the Sea and Rivers have committed to the Care of the Nymphs the angry  Naiades  lift up their immortal Voices and the prophane Wretch is struck deaf for his Impiety  Such was the Noise which now burst from one of the Rooms below and soon the Thunder which  ong had rattled at a Distance began to approach nearer and nearer 'till having ascended by Degrees up Stairs it at last entered the Apartment where the Ladies were In short to drop all Metaphor and Figure Mrs  Honour  having scolded violently below Stairs and continued the same all the Way up came  n to her Mistress in a most outrageous Passion crying out 'What doth your Ladyship think Would you imagine that this impudent Villain the Master of this House hath had the Impudence to tell me nay to stand it out to my Face that your Ladyship is that nasty stinking Whre  Jenny Cameron  they call her that runs about the Country with the Pretender Nay the lying fancy Villain had the Assurance to tell me that your Ladyship had owned yourself to be so But I have clawed the Rascal I have left the Marks of my Nails in his impudent Face My Lady' says I  'you fancy Scoundrel My Lady is Meat for no Pretenders  She is a young Lady of as good Fashion and Family and Fortune as any in  Somersetshire  Did you never hear of the great Squire  Western  Sirrah She is his only Daughter she isand Heiress to all his great Estate My Lady to be called a nasty  Scotch  Whre by such a VarletTo be sure I wish I had knocked his Brains out with the Punchbowl'  The principal Uneasiness with which  Sophia  was affected on this Occasion  Honour  had herself caused by having in her Passion discovered who she was However as this Mistake of the Landlord sufficiently accounted for those Passages which  Sophia  had before mistaken she acquired some Ease on that Account nor could she upon the whole forbear smiling This enraged  Honour  and she cried  'Indeed Madam I did not think your Ladyship would have made a  laughing Matter of it To be called Whore by such an impudent low Rascal Your Ladyship may be angry with me for ought I know for taking your Part since proferred Service they say stinks but to be sure I could never bear to hear a Lady of mine called WhoreNor will I bear it I am sure your Ladyship is as virtuous a Lady as ever sat Foot on  English  Ground and I will claw any Villain's Eyes out who dares for to offer to presume for to say the least Word to the contrary No body ever could say the least ill of the Character of any Lady that ever I waited upon'  Hinc illae Lachrymae  in plain Truth  Honour  had as much Love for her Mistress as most Servants have that is to sayBut besides this her Pride obliged her to support the Character of the Lady she waited on for she thought her own was in a very close Manner connected with it In Proportion as the Character of her Mistress was raised hers likewise as she conceived was raised with it and on the contrary she thought the one could not be lowered without the other  On this Subject Reader I must stop a Moment to tell thee a Story  'The famous  Nell Gwynn  stepping one Day from a House where she had made a short Visit in her Coach saw a great Mob assembled and her Footman all bloody and dirty the Fellow being asked by his Mistress the Reason of his being in that Condition answered 'I have been fighting Madam with an impudent Rescal who called your Ladyship a Whre 'You Blockhead' replied Mrs  Gwynn  'at this Rate you must fight every Day of your Life why you Fool all the World knows it'  "Do they" cries the Fellow in a muttering Voice after he had shut the Coach Door 'they shan't call me a Whore's Footman for all that'  Thus the Passion of Mrs  Honour  appears natural enough even if it were to be no otherwise accounted for but in reality there was another Cause of her Anger for which we must beg Leave to remind our Reader of a Circumstance mentioned in the above Simile There are indeed certain Liquors which being applied to our Passions or to Fire produce Effects the very Reverse of those produced by Water as they serve to kindle and inflame rather than to extinguish Among these the generous Liquor called Punch is one It was not therefore without Reason that the learned Dr  Cheney  used to call drinking Punch pouring liquid Fire down your Throat  Now Mrs  Honour  had unluckily poured so much of this liquid Fire down her Throat that the Smoke of it began to ascend into her Pericranium and blinded the Eyes of Reason which is there supposed to keep her Residence while the Fire itself from the Stomach easily reached the Heart and there inflamed the noble Passion of Pride So that upon the whole we shall cease to wonder at the violent Rage of the Waitingwoman tho' at first Sight we must confess the Cause seems inadequate to the Effect  Sophia  and her Cousin both did all in their Power to extinguish these Flames which had roared so loudly all over the House They at length prevailed or to carry the Metaphor one Step farther the Fire having consumed all the Fuel which the Language affords to wit every reproachful Term in it at last went out of its own Accord  But tho' Tranquillity was restored above Stairs it was not so below where my Landlady highly resenting the Injury done to the Beauty of her Husband by the FleshSpades of Mrs  Honour  called aloud for Revenge and Justice As to the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement he was perfectly quiet Perhaps the Blood which he lost might have cooled his Anger For the Enemy had not only applied her Nails to his Cheeks but likewise her Fist to his Nostils which lamented the Blow with Tears of Blood in great Abundance To this we may add Reflections on his Mistake but indeed nothing so effectually silenced his Resentment as the Manner in which he now discovered his Error for as to the Behaviour of Mrs  Honour  it had the more confirmed him in his Opinion but he was now assured by a Person of great Figure and who was attended by a great Equipage that one of the Ladies was a Woman of Fashion and his intimate Acquaintance  By the Orders of this Person the Landlord now ascended and acquainted our fair Travellers that a great Gentleman below desired to do them the Honour of waiting on them  Sophia  turned pale and trembled at this Message tho' the Reader will conclude it was too civil notwithstanding the Landlord's Blunder to have come from her Father but Fear hath the common Fault of a Justice of Peace and is apt to conclude hastily from every slight Circumstance without examining the Evidence on both Sides  To ease the Reader's Curiosity therefore rather than his Apprehensions we proceed to inform him  that an  Irish  Peer had arrived very late that Evening at the Inn in his Way to  London  This Nobleman having sallied from his Supper at the Hurricane before commemorated had seen the Attendant of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  and upon a short Enquiry was informed that her Lady with whom he was very particularly acquainted was above This Information he had no sooner received than he addressed himself to the Landlord pacified him and sent him up Stairs with Compliments rather civiler than those which were delivered  It may perhaps be wondered at that the Waitingwoman herself was not the Messenger employed on this Occasion but we are sorry to say she was not at present qualified for that or indeed for any other Office The Rum for so the Landlord chose to call the Distillation from Malt had basely taken the Advantage of the Fatigue which the poor Woman had undergone and had made terrible Depredations on her noble Faculties at a Time when they were very unable to resist the Attack  We shall not describe this tragical Scene too fully but we thought ourselves obliged by that historic Integrity which we profess shortly to hint a Matter which we would otherwise have been glad to have spared Many Historians indeed for Want of this Integrity or of Diligence to say no worse often leave the Reader to find out these little Circumstances in the Dark and sometimes to his great Confusion and Perplexity  Sophia  was very soon eased of her causeless Fright by the Entry of the noble Peer who was not only an intimate Acquaintance of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  but in reality a very particular Friend of that Lady To say Truth it was by his Assistance that she had been enabled to escape from her Husband for this Nobleman had the same gallant Disposition with those renowned Knights of whom we read in heroic Story  and had delivered many an imprisoned Nymph from Durance He was indeed as bitter an Enemy to the savage Authority too often exercised by Husbands and Fathers over the young and lovely of the other Sex as ever Knight Errant was to the barbarous Power of Enchanters nay to say Truth I have often suspected that those very Enchanters with which Romance every where abounds were in reality no other than the Husbands of those Days and Matrimony itself was perhaps the enchanted Castle in which the Nymphs were said to be confined  This Nobleman had an Estate in the Neighbourhood of  Fitzpatrick  and had been for some Time acquainted with the Lady No sooner therefore did he hear of her Confinement than he earnestly applied himself to procure her Liberty which he presently effected not by storming the Castle according to the Example of ancient Heroes but by corrupting the Governor in Conformity with the modern Art of War in which Craft is held to be preferable to Valour and Gold is found to be more irresistible than either Lead or Steel  This Circumstance however as the Lady did not think it material enough to relate to her Friend we would not at that Time impart it to the Reader We rather chose to leave him a while under a Supposition that she had found or coined or by some very extraordinary perhaps supernatural Means had possessed herself of the Money with which she had bribed her Keeper than to interrupt her Narrative by giving a Hint of what seemed to her of too little Importance to be mentioned  The Peer after a short Conversation could not forbear expressing some Surprize at meeting the Lady in that Place nor could he refrain from telling her he imagined she had been gone to  Bath  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  very freely answered  'That she had been prevented in her Purpose by the Arrival of a Person  she need not mention In short' says she 'I was overtaken by my Husband for I need not affect to conceal what the World knows too well already I had the good Fortune to escape in a most surprizing Manner and am now going to  London  with this young Lady who is a near Relation of mine and who hath escaped from as great a Tyrant as my own'  His Lordship concluding that this Tyrant was likewise a Husband made a Speech full of Compliments to both the Ladies and as full of Invectives against his own Sex nor indeed did he avoid some oblique Glances at the matrimonial Institution itself and at the unjust Powers given by it to Man over the more sensible and more meritorious Part of the Species He ended his Oration with an Offer of his Protection and of his Coach and Six which was instantly accepted by Mrs  Fitzpatrick  and at last upon her Persuasions by  Sophia  Matters being thus adjusted his Lordship took his Leave and the Ladies retired to Rest where Mrs  Fitzpatrick  entertained her Cousin with many high Encomiums on the Character of the noble Peer and enlarged very particularly on his great Fondness for his Wife saying she believed he was almost the only Person of his Rank who was entirely constant to the Marriage Bed  'Indeed added she my dear  Sophy  that is a very rare Virtue amongst Men of Condition Never expect it when you marry for believe me if you do you will certainly be deceived'  A gentle Sigh stole from  Sophia  at these Words which perhaps contributed to form a Dream of no very pleasant Kind but as she never revealed this Dream to any one so the Reader cannot expect to see it related here  CHAP IX  The Morning introduced in some pretty Writing A Stage Coach The Civility of Chambermaids The heroic Temper of  Sophia  Her Generosity The Return to it The Departure of the Company and their Arrival at  London  with some Remarks for the Use of Travellers  THOSE Members of the Society who are born to furnish the Blessings of Life now began to light their Candles in order to pursue their daily Labours for the Use of those who are born to enjoy these Blessings The sturdy Hind now attends the Levee of his Fellow Labourer the OX the cunning Artificer the diligent mechanic spring from their hard Mattress and now the bonny Housemaid begins to repair the disordered DrumRoom while the riotous Authors of that Disorder in broken interrupted Slumbers tumble and toss as if the Hardness of Down disquieted their Repose  In simple Phrase the Clock had no sooner struck Seven than the Ladies were ready for their Journey and at their Desire his Lordship and his Equipage were prepared to attend them  And now a Matter of some Difficulty arose and this was how his Lordship himself should be conveyed For tho' in Stage Coaches where Passengers are properly considered as so much Luggage the ingenious Coachman stows half a Dozen with perfect Ease into the Place of four for well he contrives that the fat Hostess or wellfed Alderman may take up no more Room than the slim Miss or taper Master it being the Nature of Guts when well squeezed to give Way and to lie in a narrow Compass yet in these Vehicles which are called for Distinctionsake Gentlemens Coaches tho' they are often larger  than the others this Method of packing is never attempted  His Lordship would have put a short End to the Difficulty by very gallantly desiring to mount his Horse but Mrs  Fitzpatrick  would by no Means consent to it It was therefore concluded that the  Abigails  should by Turns relieve each other on one of his Lordship's Horses which was presently equipped with a SideSaddle for that Purpose  Every thing being settled at the Inn the Ladies discharged their former Guides and  Sophia  made a present to the Landlord partly to repair the Bruise which he had received under herself and partly on Account of what he had suffered under the Hands of her enraged Waitingwoman And now  Sophia  first discovered a Loss which gave her some Uneasiness and this was of the hundred Pound Bank Bill which her Father had given her at their last Meeting and which within a very inconsiderable Trifle was all the Treasure she was at present worth She searched every where and shook and tumbled all her Things to no Purpose the Bill was not to be found And she was at last fully persuaded that she had lost it from her Pocket when she had the Misfortune of tumbling from her Horse in the dark Lane as before recorded A Fact that seemed the more probable as she now recollected some Discomposure in her Pockets which had happened at that Time and the great Difficulty with which she had drawn forth her Handkerchief the very Instant before her Fall in order to relieve the Distress of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  Misfortunes of this Kind whatever Inconveniencies they may be attended with are incapable of subduing a Mind in which there is any Strength without the Assistance of Avarice  Sophia  therefore tho' nothing could be worse timed than this Accident at such a Season immediately got the better of her Concern and with her wonted Serenity and Cheerfulness  of Countenance returned to her Company His Lordship conducted the Ladies into the Vehicle as he did likewise Mrs  Honour  who after many Civilities and more Dear Madams at last yielded to the wellbred Importunities of her Sister  Abigail  and submitted to be complimented with the first Ride in the Coach in which indeed she would afterwards have been contented to have pursued her whole Journey had not her Mistress after several fruitless Intimations at length forced her to take her Turn on Horseback  The Coach now having received its Company began to move forwards attended by many Servants and by two led Captains who had before rode with his Lordship and who would have been dismissed from the Vehicle upon a much less worthy Occasion than was this of accommodating two Ladies In this they acted only as Gentlemen but they were ready at any Time to have performed the Office of a Footman or indeed would have condescended lower for the Honour of his Lordship's Company and for the Convenience of his Table  My Landlord was so pleased with the Present he had received from  Sophia  that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his Bruise or his Scratches The Reader will perhaps be curious to know the  Quantum  of this Present but we cannot satisfy his Curiosity Whatever it was it satisfied the Landlord for his bodily Hurt but he lamented he had not known before how little the Lady valued her Money  'For to be sure' says he 'one might have charged every Article double and she would have made no Cavil at the Reckoning'  His Wife however was far from drawing this Conclusion whether she really felt any Injury done to her Husband more than he did himself I will not say certain it is she was much less satisfied with the Generosity of  Sophia  Indeed' cries she 'my Dear  the Lady knows better how to dispose of her Money than you imagine She might very well think we should not put up such a Business without some Satisfaction and the Law would have cost her an infinite deal more than this poor little Matter which I wonder you would take' 'You are always so bloodily wise' quoth the Husband 'It would have cost her more would it Dost fancy I don't know that as well as thee But would any of that more or so much have come into our Pockets Indeed if Son  Tom  the Lawyer had been alive I could have been glad to have put such a pretty Business into his Hands He would have got a good Picking out of it but I have no Relation now who is a Lawyer and why should I go to Law for the Benefit of Strangers Nay to be sure' answered she you must know best' 'I believe I do' replied  e 'I fancy when Money is to be got I can smell it out as well as another Every body let me tell you would not have talked People out of this Mind that I say every body would not have cajoled this out of her mind that' The Wife then  oined in the Applause of her Husband's Sagacity  nd thus ended the short Dialogue between them on his Occasion  We will therefore take our Leave of these good People and attend his Lordship and his fair Companions who made such good Expedition that they performed a Journey of ninety Miles in two Days  nd on the second Evening arrived in  London  without having encountered any one Adventure on the Road worthy the Dignity of this History to relate Our Pen therefore shall imitate the Expedition which describes and our History shall keep Pace with the Travellers who are its Subject Good Writers will  ndeed do well to imitate the ingenious Traveller in his Instance who always proportions his Stay at any Place to the Beauties Elegancies and Curiosities  which it affords At  Eshur  at  Stowe  at  Wilton  at  Eastbury  and at  Prior  's  Park  Days are too short for the ravished Imagination while we admire the wonderous Power of Art in improving Nature In some of these Art chiefly engages our Admiration in others Nature and Art contend for our Applause but in the last the former seems to triumph Here Nature appears in her richest Attire and A  dressed with the modestest Simplicity attends he  benignant

Hint or two concerning Virtue and a few more concerning Suspicion  OUR Company being arrived at  London  were set down at his Lordship's House where while they refreshed themselves after the Fatigue of their  ourney Servants were dispatched to provide a Lodging for the two Ladies for as her Ladyship was  ot then in Town Mrs  Fitzpatrick  would by no  leans consent to accept a Bed in the Mansion of  he Peer  Some Readers will perhaps condemn this extraordinary Delicacy as I may call it of Virtue as too  ice and scrupulous but we must make Allowances  for her Situation which must be owned to have been very ticklish and when we consider the Malice of censorious Tongues we must allow if it was a Fault the Fault was an Excess on the right Side and which every Woman who is in the selfsame Situation will do well to imitate The most formal Appearance of Virtue when it is only an Appearance may perhaps in very abstracted Considerations seem to be rather less commendable than Virtue itself without this Formality but it will however be always more commended and this I believe will be granted by all that it is necessary unless in some very particular Cases for every Women to support either the one or the other  A Lodging being prepared  Sophia  accompanied her Cousin for that Evening but resolved early in the Morning to enquire after the Lady into whose Protection as we have formerly mentioned she had determined to throw herself when she quitted her Father's House And this she was the more eager in doing for some Observations she had made during her Journey in the Coach  Now as we could by no Means fix the odious Character of Suspicion on  Sophia  we are almost afraid to open to our Reader the Conceits which filled he Mind concerning Mrs  Fitzpatrick  of whom she certainly entertained at present some Doubts which as they are very apt to enter into the Bosoms of th  worst of People we think proper not to mention more plainly till we have first suggested a Word o  two to our Reader touching Suspicion in general  Of this there have always appeared to me to b  two Degrees The first of these I chuse to deriv  from the Heart as the extreme Velocity of its Discernment seems to denote some previous inward Impulse and the rather as this superlative Degre  often forms its own Objects sees what it is not  and always more than really exists This is that quicksighted Penetration whose Hawk's Eyes no Symptom of Evil can escape which observes not only upon the Actions but upon the Words and Looks of Men and as it proceeds from the Heart of the Observer so it dives into the Heart of the Observed and there espies Evil as it were in the first Embryo nay sometimes before it can be said to be conceived An admirable Faculty if it were infallible but as this Degree of Perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal Being so from the Fallibility of such acute Discernment have arisen many sad Mischiefs and most grievous Heartakes to Innocence and Virtue I cannot help therefore regarding this vast Quicksightedness into Evil as a vicious Excess and a very pernicious Evil in itself And I am the more inclined to this Opinion as I am afraid it always proceeds from a Bad Heart for the Reasons I have abovementioned and for one more namely because I never knew it the Property of a good one Now from this Degree of Suspicion I entirely and absolutely acquit  Sophia  A second Degree of this Quality seems to arise from the Head This is indeed no other than the Faculty of seeing what is before your Eyes and of drawing Conclusions from what you see The former of these is unavoidable by those who have any Eyes and the latter is perhaps no less certain and necessary a Consequence of our having any Brains This is altogether as bitter an Enemy to Guilt as the former is to Innocence nor can I see it in an unamiable Light even though through human Fallibility it should be sometimes mistaken For Instance if a Husband should accidentally surprize his Wife in the Lap or in the Embraces of some of those pretty young Gentlemen who profess the Art of Cuckoldom I should not highly I think blame him for  concluding more than what he saw from the Familiarities which he really had seen and which we are at least favourable enough to when we call them innocent Freedoms The Reader will easily suggest great Plenty of Instances to himself I shall add but one more which however unchristian it may be thought by some I cannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable and this is a Suspicion that a Man iscapable of doing what he hath done already and tha  it is possible for one who hath been a Villain once to act the same Part again And to confess the Truth of this Degree of Suspicion I believe  Sophia  was guilty From this Degree of Suspicion she had in Fact conceived an Opinion that her Cousin was really not better than she should be  The Case it seems was this Mrs  Fitzpatrick  wisely considered that the Virtue of a young Lady is in the World in the same Situation with a poor Hare which is certain whenever it ventures abroad to meet its Enemies For it can hardly meet any other No sooner therefore was she determined to take the first Opportunity of quitting the Protection of her Husband than she resolved to cast herself under the Protection of some other Man and whom could she so properly chuse to be her Guardian as a Person of Quality of Fortune of Honour and who besides a gallant Disposition which inclines Men to KnightErrantry that is to be the Champions of Ladies in Distress had often declared a violent Attachment to herself and had already given her all the Instances of it in his Power  But as the Law hath foolishly omitted this Office of ViceHusband or Guardian to an eloped Lady and as Malice is apt to denominate him by a more disagreeable Appellation it was concluded that his Lordship should perform all such kind Offices to the Lady in secret and without publickly assuming the Character of her Protector Nay to prevent any other  Person from seeing him in this Light it was agreed that the Lady should proceed directly to  Bath  and that his Lordship should first go to  London  and thence should go down to that Place by the Advice of his Physicians  Now all this  Sophia  very plainly understood not from the Lips or Behaviour of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  but from the Peer who was infinitely less expert at retaining a Secret than was the good Lady and perhaps the exact Secrecy which Mrs  Fitzpatrick  had observed on this Head in her Narrative served not a little to heighten those Suspicions which were now risen in the Mind of her Cousin  Sophia  very easily found out the Lady she sought for indeed there was not a Chairman in Town to whom her House was not perfectly well known and as she received in Return of her first Message a most pressing Invitation she immediately accepted it Mrs  Fitzpatrick  indeed did not desire her Cousin to stay with her with more earnestness than Civility required Whether she had discerned and resented the Suspicion abovementioned or from what other Motive it arose I cannot say but certain it is she was full as desirous of parting with  Sophia  as  Sophia  herself could be of going  The young Lady when she came to take Leave of her Cousin could not avoid giving her a short Hint of Advice She begged her for Heaven's Sake to take Care of herself and to consider in how dangerous a Situation she stood adding she hoped some Method would be found of reconciling her to her Husband  'You must remember my Dear says she the Maxim which my Aunt  Western  hath so often repeated to us both  That whenever the Matrimonial Alliance is broke and War declared between Husband and Wife she can hardly make a disadvantageous Peace for herself on any Conditions  These are my Aunt's very Words and she hath had a great deal of Experience in the World'  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  answered with a contemptuous Smile  'Never fear me Child take Care of yourself for you are younger than me I will come and visit you in a few Days but dear  Sophy  let me give you one Piece of Advice Leave the Character of  Graveairs  in the Country for believe me it will sit very aukwardly upon you in this Town'  Thus the two Cousins parted and  Sophia  repaired directly to Lady  Bellaston  where she found a most hearty as well as most polite Welcome The Lady had taken a great Fancy to her when she had seen her formerly with her Aunt  Western  She was indeed extremely glad to see her and was no sooner acquainted with the Reasons which induced her to leave the Squire and fly to  London  than she highly applauded her Sense and Resolution and after expressing the highest Satisfaction in the Opinion which  Sophia  had declared she entertained of her Ladyship by chusing her House for an Asylum she promised her all the Protection which it was in her Power to give  As we have now brought  Sophia  into safe Hands the Reader will I apprehend be contented to deposite her there a while and to look a little after other Personages and particularly poor  Jones  whom we have left long enough to do Penance for his past Offences which as is the Nature of Vice brought sufficient Punishment upon him themselves  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XII  Containing the same individual Time with the former  CHAP I  Shewing what is to be deemed Plagiarism in a modern Author and what is to be considered as lawful Prize  THE learned Reader must have observed that in the Course of this mighty Work I have often translated Passages out of the best antient Authors without quoting the Original or without taking the least Notice of the Book from whence they were borrowed  This Conduct in Writing is placed in a proper Light by the ingenious Abbe  Bannier  in his Preface to his Mythology a Work of great Erudition and of equal Judgment  'It will be easy' says he 'for the Reader to observe that I have frequently had greater Regard to him than to my own Reputation For an Author certainly pays him a considerable  Compliment when for his Sake he suppresses learned Quotations that come in his Way and which would have cost him but the bare Trouble of translating'  To fill up a Work with these Scraps may indeed be considered as a downright Cheat on the learned World who are by such Means imposed upon to buy a second Time in Fragments and by Retail what they have already in Gross if not in their Memories upon their Shelves and it is still more cruel upon the Illiterate who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of Use to them A Writer who intermixes great Quaintity of  Greek  and  Latin  with his Works deals by the Ladies and fine Gentlemen in the same paultry Manner with which they are treated by the Auctioneers who often endeavour so to confound and mix up their Lots that in order to purchase the Commodity you want you are obliged at the same Time to purchase that which will do you no Service  And yet as there is no Conduct so fair and disinterested but that it may be misunderstood by Ignorance and misrepresented by Malice I have been sometimes tempted to preserve my own Reputation at the Expence of my Reader and to transcribe the Original or at least to quote Chapter and Verse whenever I have made Use either of the Thought or Expression of another I am indeed in some Doubt that I have often suffered by that contrary Method and that by suppressing the original Author's Name I have been rather suspected of Plagiarism than reputed to act from the amiable Motive aboveassigned by that justly celebrated  Frenchman  Now to obviate all such Imputations for the future I do here confess and justify the Fact The Ancients may be considered as a rich Common where every Person who hath the smallest Tenement in  Parnassus  hath a free Right to fatten his Muse Or to place it in a clearer Light we Moderns are to the Antients  what the Poor are to the Rich By the Poor here I mean that large and venerable Body which in  English  we call The Mob Now whoever hath had the Honour to be admitted to any Degree of Intimacy with this Mob must well know that it is one of their established Maxims to plunder and pillage their rich Neighbours without any Reluctance and that this is held to be neither Sin nor Shame among them And so constantly do they abide and act by this Maxim that in every Parish almost in the Kingdom there is a Kind of Confederacy ever carrying on against a certain Person of Opulence called the Squire whose Property is considered as FreeBooty by all his poor Neighbours who as they conclude that there is no Manner of Guilt in such Depredations look upon it is a Point of Honour and moral Obligation to conceal and to preserve each other from Punishment on all such Occasions  In like Manner are the Ancients such as  Homer Virgil Horace Cicero  and the rest to be esteemed among us Writers as so many wealthy Squires from whom we the Poor of  Parnassus  claim an immemorial Custom of taking whatever we can come at This Liberty I demand and this I am as ready to allow again to my poor Neighbours in their Turn All profess and all I require from my Brethren is to maintain the same strict Honesty among ourselves which the Mob shew to one another To steal from one another is indeed highly criminal and indecent for this may be strictly stiled defrauding the Poor sometimes perhaps those who are poorer than ourselves or to see it under the most opprobrious Colours robbing the Spittal  Since therefore upon the strictest Examination my own Conscience cannot lay any such pitiful Theft to my Charge I am contented to plead guilty to the former Accusation nor shall I ever scruple to take to my self any Passage which I shall find in an ancient Author  to my Purpose without setting down the Name of the Author from whence it was taken Nay I absolutely claim a Property in all such Sentiments the Moment they are transcribed into my Writings and I expect all Readers henceforward to regard them as purely and entirely my own This Claim however I desire to be allowed me only on Condition that I preserve strict Honesty towards my poor Brethren from whom if ever I borrow any of that little of which they are possessed I shall never fail to put their Mark upon it that it may be at all Times ready to be restored to the right Owner  The Omission of this was highly blameable in one Mr  Moore  who having formerly borrowed some Lines of  Pope  and Company took the Liberty to transcribe six of them into his Play of the  Rival Modes  Mr  Pope  however very luckily found them in the said Play and laying violent Hands on his own Property transferred it back again into his own Works and for a further Punishment imprisoned the said  Moore  in the loathsome Dungeon of the  Dunciad  where his unhappy Memory now remains and eternally will remain as a proper Punishment for such his unjust Dealings in the poetical Trade  CHAP II  In which tho' the Squire doth not find his Daughter something is found which puts an End to his Pursuit  THE History now returns to the Inn at  Upton  whence we shall first trace the Footsteps of Squire  Western  for as he will soon arrive at an End of his Journey we shall have then full Leisure to attend our Heroe  The Reader may be pleased to remember that the said Squire departed from the Inn in great Fury and in that Fury he pursued his Daughter The Hostler having informed him that she had crossed the  Severn  he likewise past that River with his Equipage and rode full Speed vowing the utmost Vengeance against poor  Sophia  if he should but overtake her  He had not gone far before he arrived at a Crossway Here he called a short Council of War in which after hearing different Opinions he at last gave the Direction of his Pursuit to Fortune and struck directly into the  Worcester  Road  In this Road he proceeded about two Miles when he began to bemoan himself most bitterly frequently crying out  'What Pity is it Sure never was so unlucky a Dog as myself and then burst forth a Volley of Oaths and Execrations'  The Parson attempted to administer Comfort to him on this Occasion  'Sorrow not Sir' says he like those without Hope Howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young Madam we may account it some good Fortune that we have hitherto traced her Course aright Peradventure she will soon be fatigated with her Journey and will tarry in some Inn in order to renovate her corporeal Functions and in that Case in all moral Certainty you will very briefly be  compos voti  '  'Pogh Dn the Slut' answered the Squire I am lamenting the Loss of so fine a Morning for Hunting It is confounded hard to lose one of the best Scenting Days in all Appearance which hath been this Season and especially after so long a Frost'  Whether Fortune who now and then shews some Compassion in her wantonest Tricks might not take Pity of the Squire and as she had detirmined not to let him overtake his Daughter might not resolve to make him Amends some other Way I will not assert but he had hardly uttered the Words just before commemorated and two or three Oaths at their Heels when a Pack of Hounds began to open their melodious Throats at a small Distance from them which the Squire's Horse and his Rider both perceiving  both immediately pricked up their Ears and the Squire crying 'She's gone she's gone' Damn me 'if she is not gone' instantly clapped Spurs to the Beast who little needed it having indeed the same Inclination with his Master and now the whole Company crosing into a Corn field rode directly towards the Hounds with much Hollowing and Hooping while the poor Parson blessing himself brought up the Rear  Thus Fable reports that the fair  Grimalkin  whom  Venus  at the Desire of a passionate Lover converted from a Cat into a fine Woman no sooner perceived a Mouse than mindful of her former Sport and still retaining her pristine Nature she lept from the Bed of her Husband to pursue the little Animal  What are we to understand by this Not that the Bride was displeased with the Embraces of her amorous Bridegroom For tho' some have remarked that Cats are subject to Ingratitude yet Women and Cats too will be pleased and purr on certain Occasions The Truth is as the sagacious Sir  Roger L'Estrange  observes in his deep Reflections that  'if we shut Nature out at the Door she will come in at the Window and that Puss tho' a Madam will be a Mouser still'  In the same Manner we are not to arraign the Squire of any Want of Love for his Daughter For in reality he had a great deal we are only to consider that he was a Squire and a Sportsman and then we may apply the Fable to him and the judicious Reflections likewise  The Hounds ran very hard as it is called and the Squire pursued over Hedge and Ditch with all his usual Vociferation and Alacrity and with all his usual Pleasure nor did the Thoughts of  Sophia  ever once intrude themselves to allay the Satisfaction he enjoyed in the Chace which he said was one of the finest he ever saw and which he swore was very well worth going fifty Miles for As the Squire forgot his  Daughter the Servants we may easily believe forgot their Mistress and the Parson after having express'd much Astonishment in  Latin  to himself at length likewise abandoned all farther Thoughts of the young Lady and jogging on at a Distance behind began to meditate a Portion of Doctrine for the ensuing  Sunday  The Squire who owned the Hounds was highly pleased with the Arrival of his Brother Squire and Sportsman For all Men approve Merit in their own Way and no Man was more expert in the Field than Mr  Western  nor did any other better know how to encourage the Dogs with his Voice and to animate the Hunt with his Holla  Sportsmen in the Warmth of a Chace are too much engaged to attend to any Manner of Ceremony nay even to the Office of Humanity For if any of them meet with an Accident by tumbling into a Ditch or into a River the rest pass on regardless and generally leave him to his Fate during this Time therefore the two Squires tho' often close to each other interchanged not a single Word The Master of the Hunt however often saw and approved the great Judgment of the Stranger in drawing the Dogs when they were at a Fault and hence conceived a very high Opinion of his Understanding as the Number of his Attendants inspired no small Reverence to his Quality As soon therefore as the Sport was ended by the Death of the little Animal which had occasioned it the two Squires met and in all Squirelike Greeting saluted each other  The Conversation was entertaining enough and what we may perhaps relate in an Appendix or on some other Occasion but as it nowise concerns this History we cannot prevail on ourselves to give it a Place here It concluded with a second Chace and that with an Invitation to Dinner This being accepted was followed by a hearty Bout of Drinking  which ended in as hearty a Nap on the Part of Squire  Western  Our Squire was by no Means a Match either for his Host or for Parson  Supple  at his Cups that Evening for which the violent Fatigue of Mind as well as Body that he had undergone may very well account without the least Derogation from his Honour He was indeed according to the vulgar Phrase whistled drunk for before he had swallowed the third Bottle he became so entirely overpowered that tho' he was not carried off to Bed till long after the Parson considered him as absent and having acquainted the other Squire with all relating to  Sophia  he obtained his Promise of seconding those Arguments which he intended to urge the next Morning for Mr  Western  's Return  No sooner therefore had the good Squire shaken off his Evening and began to call for his Morning Draught and to summon his Horses in order to renew his Pursuit than Mr  Supple  began his Dissuasives which the Host so strongly seconded that they at length prevailed and Mr  Western  agreed to return home being principally moved by one Argument  viz  That he knew not which Way to go and might probably be riding farther from his Daughter instead of towards her He then took Leave of his Brother Sportsman and expressing great Joy that the Frost was broken which might perhaps be no small Motive to his hastening home set forwards or rather backwards for  Somersetshire  but not before he dispatched Part of his Retinue in quest of his Daughter after whom he likewise sent a Volley of the most bitter Execrations which he could invent  CHAP III  The Departure of  Jones  from  Upton  with what past between him and  Partridge  on the Road  AT length we are once more come to our Heroe and to say Truth we have been obliged to part with him so long that considering the Condition in which we left him I apprehend many of our Readers have concluded we intended to abandon him for ever he being at present in that Situation in which prudent People usually desist from enquiring any farther after their Friends lest they should be shocked by hearing such Friends had hanged themselves  But in reality if we have not all the Virtues I will boldly say neither have we all the Vices of a prudent Character and tho' it is not easy to conceive Circumstances much more miserable than those of poor  Jones  at present we shall return to him and attend upon him with the same Diligence as if he was wantoning in the brightest Beams  Fortune  Mr  Jones  then and his Companion  Partridge  left the Inn a few Minutes after the Departure of Squire  Western  and pursued the same Road on Foot for the Ostler told them that no Horses were by any Means to be at that Time procured at  Upton  On they marched with heavy Hearts for tho' their Disquiet proceeded from very different Reasons yet displeased they were both and if  Jones  sighed bitterly  Partridge  grunted altogether as sadly every Step  When they came to the Crossroads where the Squire had stopt to take Council  Jones  stopt likewise and turning to  Partridge  asked his Opinion which Track they should pursue  Ah Sir' answered  Partridge  I wish your Honour would follow my Advice'  'Why should I not' replied  Jones  for it is now indifferent to me whither I go or what  becomes of me  'My Advice then said  Partridge  is that you immediately face about and return home For who that had such a Home to return to as your Honour would travel thus about the Country like a' Vagabond I ask Pardon  sed vox easola reperta est  '  'Alas cries  Jones  I have no Home to return tobut if my Friend my Father would receive me could I bear the Country from which  Sophia  is flownCruel  Sophia  Cruel No Let me blame myselfNo let me blame thee Dnation seize thee Fool Blockhead thou hast undone me' and I will tear thy Soul from thy Body  At which Words he laid violent Hands on the Collar of poor  Partridge  and shook him more heartily than an Ague Fit or his own Fears had ever done before  Partridge  fell trembling on his Knees and begged for Mercy vowing he had meant no Harmwhen  Jones  after staring wildly on him for a Moment quitted his Hold and discharged a Rage on himself that had it fallen on the other would certainly have put an End to his  eing which indeed the very Apprehension of it had almost effected  We would bestow some Pains here in minutely describing all the mad Pranks which  Jones  played on this Occasion could we be well assured that the Reader would take the same Pains in perusing them but as we are appprehensive that after all the Labour which we should employ in painting this Scene the said Reader would be very apt to skip it entirely over we have saved ourselves that Trouble To say the Truth we have from this Reason alone often done great Violence to the Luxuriance of our Genius and have left many excellent Descriptions out of our Work which would otherwise have been in it And this Suspicion to be honest arises as is generally the Case from our own wicked Heart for we have ourselves been very often most horridly given to jumping as we have run through the Pages of voluminous Historians  Suffice it then simply to say that  Jones  after having played the Part of a Madam for many Minutes came by Degrees to himself which no sooner happened than turning to  Partridge  he very earnestly begged his Pardon for the Attack he had made on him in the Violence of his Passion but concluded by desiring him never to mention his Return again for he was resolved never to see that Country any more  Partridge  easily forgave and faithfully promised to obey the Injunction now laid upon him And then  Jones  very briskly cried out  'Since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the Steps of my AngelI will pursue those of Glory Come on my brave Lad now for the ArmyIt is a glorious Cause and I would willingly sacrifice my Life in it even tho' it was worth my preserving'  And so saying he immediately struck into the different Road from that which the Squire had taken and by mere Chance pursued the very same thro' which  Sophia  had before passed  Our Travellers now marched a full Mile without speaking a Syllable to each other tho'  Jones  indeed muttered many things to himself as to  Partridge  he was profoundly silent For he was not perhaps perfectly recovered from his former Fright besides he had Apprehensions of provoking his Friend to a second Fit of Wrath especially as he now began to entertain a Conceit which may not perhaps create any great Wonder in the Reader In short he began now to suspect that  Jones  was absolutely out of his Senses  At length  Jones  being weary of Soliloquy addressed himself to his Companion and blamed him for his Taciturnity For which the poor Man very honestly accounted from his Fear of giving Offence And now this Fear being pretty well removed by the most absolute Promises of Indemnity  Partradge  again took the Bridle from his Tongue which perheps rejoiced no less at regaining its Liberty than a young Colt when the Bridle is slipt from his Neck and he is turned loose into the Pastures  As  Partridge  was inhibited from that Topic which would have first suggested itself he fell upon that which was next uppermost in his Mind namely the Man of the Hill  'Certainly Sir says he that could never be a Man who dresses himself and lives after such a strange Manner and so unlike other Folks Besides his Diet as the old Woman told me is chiefly upon Herbs which is a fitter Food for a Horse than a Christian Nay Landlord at  Upton  says that the Neighbours thereabouts have very fearful Notions about him It runs strangely in my Head that it must have been some Spirit who perhaps might be sent to forewarn us And who knows but all that Matter which he told us of his going to Fight and of his being taken Prisoner and of the great Danger he was in of being hanged might be intended as a Warning to us considering what we are going about Besides I dreamt of nothing all last Night but of Fighting and methought the Blood ran out of my Nose as Liquor out of a Tap Indeed Sir  infandum Regina jubes renovare dolorem'  'Thy Story  Partridge'  answered  Jones  is almost as ill applied as thy  Latin  Nothing can be more likely to happen than Death to Men who go into Battle Perhaps we shall both fall in itand what then'  'What then' replied  Partridge  Why then there is an End of us is there not When I am gone all is over with me What matters the Cause to me or who gets the Victory if I am killed I shall never enjoy any Advantage from it What are all the ringing of Bells and Bonfires to one that is six Foot under Ground There will be an End of poor  Partridge  And an End  of poor  Partridge  cries  Jones  there must be one Time or other If you love  Latin  I will repeat you some fine Lines out of  Horace  which' would Inspire Courage into a Coward  Dulce decorum est pro Patria mori  Mors fugacem persequitur virum  Nec parcit imbellis juventae  Popliti  us timidoque tergo  'I wish you would construe them' cries  Partride  'for  Horace  is a hard Author and I cannot understand as you repeat them'  'I will repeat you a bad Imitation or rather Paraphrase of my own said  Jones  for I am but an' indifferent Poet'  'Who would not die in his dear Country's Cause  'Since if base Fear his dastard Step withdraws  'From Death he cannot flyOne common Grave  'Receives at last the Coward and the Brave'  'That's very certain cries  Partridge  Ay sure  Mors omnibus communis  But there is a great Difference between dying in ones Bed a great many Years hence like a good Christian with all our Friends crying about us and being shot ToDay or Tomorrow like a Maddog or perhaps hacked in twenty Pieces with a Sword and that too before we have repented of all our Sins O Lord have Mercy upon us To be sure the Soldiers are a wicked Kind of People I never loved to have any Thing to do with them I never could bring myself hardly to look upon them as Christians There is nothing but Cursing and Swearing among them I wish your Honour would repent I heartily wish you would repent before it is too late and not think of going among  themEvil Communication corrupts good Manners That is my principal Reason For as for that Matter I am no more afraid than another Man not I as to Matter of that I know all human Flesh must die but yet a Man may live many Years for all that Why I am a middleaged Man now and yet I may live a great Number of Years I have read of several who have lived to be above a hundred and some a great deal above a hundred Not that I hope I mean that I promise myself to live to any such Age as that neitherBut if it be only to eighty or ninety Heaven be praised that is a great Ways off yet and I am not afraid of dying then no more than another Man But surely to tempt Death before a Man's Time is come seems to me downright Wickedness and Presumption Besides if it was to do any good indeed but let the Cause be what it will what mighty Matter of Good can two People do And for my Part I understand nothing of it I never fired off a Gun above ten Times in my Life and then it was not charged with Bullets And for the Sword I never learned to fence and know nothing of the Matter And then there are those Cannons which certainly it must be thought the highest Presumption to go in the Way of and nobody but a MadmanI ask Pardon upon my Soul I meant no Harm I beg I may not throw your Honour into another Passion'  'Be under no Apprehension  Partridge'  cries  Jones  I am now so well convinced of thy Cowardice that thou couldst not provoke me on any Account Your Honour answered he may call me Coward or any Thing else you please If loving to Sleep in a whole Skin makes a Man a Coward  non immunes ab illis malis sumus  I never read in my Grammar that a Man can't be a good Man without fighting  Vir bonus est quis  Qui consulta Patrum qui leges juraque servat  Not a Word of Fighting and I am sure the Scripture is so much against it that a Man shall never persuade me he is a good Christian while he sheds Christianblood'  CHAP IV  The Adventure of a BeggarMan  JUST as  Partridge  had uttered that good and pious Doctrine with which the last Chapter concluded they arrived at another Crossway when a lame Fellow in Rags asked them for Alms upon which  Partridge  gave him a severe Rebuke saying 'Every Parish ought to keep their own Poor'  Jones  then fell a laughing and asked  Partridge  if he was not ashamed with so much Charity in his Mouth to have no Charity in his Heart  'Your Religion says he serves you only for an Excuse for your Faults but is no Incentive to your Virtue Can any Man who is really a Christian abstain from relieving one of his Brethren in such a miserable Condition'  and at the same time putting his Hand in his Pocket he gave the poor Object a Shilling  'Master' cries the fellow after thanking him  'I have a curious Thing here in my Pocket which I found about two Miles off if your Worship will please to buy it I should not venture to pull it out to every one but as you are so good a Gentleman and so kind to the Poor you won't suspect a Man of being a Thief only because he is poor'  He then pulled out a little gilt Pocketbook and delivered it into the Hands of  Jones  Jones  presently opened it and guess Reader what he felt saw in the first Page the Words  Sophia Western  written by her own fair Hand He no sooner read the Name than he prest it close to his Lips nor could he avoid falling into some very frantick Raptures  notwitstanding his Company but perhaps these very Raptures made him forget he was not alone  While  Jones  was kissing and mumbling the Book as if he had an Excellent brown butter'd Crust in his Mouth or as if he had been really a Bookworm or an Author who hath nothing to eat but his own Works a Piece of Paper fell from its Leaves to the Ground which  Partridge  took up and delivered to  Jones  who presently perceived it to be a Bankbill It was indeed the very Bill which  Western  had given his Daughter the Night before her Departure and a  Jew  would have jumped to purchase it at five Shilllngs less than  l  The Eyes of  Partridge  sparkled at this News which  Jones  now proclaimed aloud and so did tho' with somewhat a different Aspect those of the poor Fellow who had found the Book and who I hope from a Principle of Honesty had never opened it But we should not deal honestly by the Reader if we omitted to inform him of a Circumstance which may be here a little material  viz  That the Fellow could not read  Jones  who had felt nothing but pure Joy and Transport from the finding the Book was affected with a Mixture of Concern at this new Discovery For his Imagination instantly suggested to him that the Owner of the Bill might possibly want it before he could be able to convey it to her He then acquainted the Finder that he knew the Lady to whom the Book belonged and would endeavour to find her out as soon as possible and return it her  The PocketBook was a late Present from Mrs  Western  to her Neice It had cost five and twenty Shillings having been bought of a celebrated Toyman but the real Value of the Silver which it contained in its clasp was about  d  and that Price the said  Toyman as it was altogether as good as when it first issued from his Shop would now have given for it A prudent Person would however have taken proper Advantage of the Ignorance of this Fellow and would not have offered more than a Shilling or perhaps Sixpence for it nay some perhaps would have given nothing and left the Fellow to his Action of Trover which some learned Serjeants may doubt whether he could under these Circumstances have maintained  Jones  on the contrary whose Character was on the outside of Generosity and may perhaps not very unjustly have been suspected of Extravagance without any Hesitation gave a Guinea in Exchange for the Book The poor man who had not for a long Time before been possessed of so much Treasure gave Mr  Jones  a thousand Thanks and discovered little less of Transport in his Muscles than  Jones  had before shewn when he had first read the Name of  Sophia Western  The Fellow very readily agreed to attend our Travellers to the Place where he had found the PocketBook Together therefore they proceeded directly thither but not so fast as Mr  Jones  desired for his Guide unfortunately happened to be lame and could not possibly travel faster than a Mile an Hour As this Place therefore was at above three Miles Distance though the Fellow had said otherwise the Reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it  Jones  opened the Book a hundred Times during their Walk kissed it as often talked much to himself and very little to his Companions At all which the Guide exprest some Signs of Astonishment to  Partridge  who more than once shook his Head and cry'd poor Gentleman  orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano  At length they arrived at the very Spot where  Sophia  unhappily dropt the PocketBook and where the Fellow had as happily found it Here  Jones  offered to take Leave of his Guide and to improve his Pace but the Fellow in whom that violent Surprize and Joy which the first Receipt of the Guinea had occasioned was now considerably abated and who had now had sufficient Time to recollect himself put on a discontented Look and scratching his Head said  'He hoped his Worship would give him something more Your Worship' said he 'will I hope take it into your Consideration that if I had not been honest I might have kept the Whole'  And indeed this the Reader must confess to have been true  'If the Paper there said he be worth  l  I am sure the finding it deserves more than a Guinea Besides suppose your Worship should never see the Lady nor give it herand though your Worship looks and talks very much like a Gentleman yet I have only your Worship's bare Word And certainly if the right Owner ben't to be found it all belongs to the first Finder I hope your Worship will consider all these Matters I am but a poor Man and therefore don't desire to have all but it is but reasonable I should have my Share'  'Your Worship looks like a good Man and I hope will consider my Honesty For I might have kept every Farthing and no Body ever the wiser' I promise thee upon my Honour' cries  Jones  that I know the right Owner and will restore it her' Nay your Worship' answered the Fellow 'may do as you please as to that if you will but give me my Share that is one half of the Money your Honour may keep the rest yourself if you please'  and concluded with swearing by a very vehement Oath  'that he would never mention a Syllable of it to any Man living'  'Lookee Friend cries  Jones  the right Owner shall certainly have again all that she lost and as for any further Gratuity I really cannot give it you at present but let me know your Name and where you live and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further Reason to rejoice at this Morning's Adventure'  'I don't know what you mean by Venture' cries the Fellow it seems I must venture whether you will return the Lady her Money or no But I hope your Worship will considerCome come said  Partridge  tell his Honour your Name and where you may be found I warrant you will never repent having put the Money into his Hands'  The Fellow seeing no Hopes of recovering the Possession of the PocketBook at last complied in giving in his Name and Place of Abode which  Jones  writ upon a Piece of Paper with the Pencil of  Sophia  and then placing the Paper in the same Page where she had writ her Name he cry'd out  'There Friend you are the happiest Man alive I have joined your Name to that of an Angel' 'I don't know any Thing about Angels' answered the Fellow 'but I wish you would give me a little more Money or else return me the PocketBook'  Partridge  now waxed wroth he called the poor Cripple by several vile and opprobrious Names and was absolutely proceeding to beat him but  Jones  would not suffer any such Thing And now telling the Fellow he would certainly find some Opportunity of serving him Mr  Jones  departed as fast as his Heels would carry him and  Partridge  into whom the Thoughts of the hundred Pound had infused new Spirits followed his Leader while the Man who was obliged to stay behind fell to cursing them both as well as his Parents  'For had they says he sent me to Charity School to learn to write and read and cast Account I should  have known the Value of these Matters as well as other People'  CHAP V  Containing more Adventures which Mr  Jones  and his Companion met on the Road  OUR Travellers now walked so fast that they had very little Time or Breath for Conversation  Jones  meditating all the Way on  Sophia  and  Partridge  on the BankBill which though it gave him some Pleasure caused him at the same Time to repine at Fortune which in all his Walks had never given him such an Opportunity of shewing his Honesty They had proceeded above three Miles when  Partridge  being unable any longer to keep up with  Jones  called to him and begged him a little to slacken his Pace with this he was the more ready to comply as he had for some Time lost the Footsteps of the Horses which the Thaw had enabled him to trace during several Miles and he was now upon a wide Common where were several Roads  He here therefore stopt to consider which of these Roads he should pursue when on a sudden they heard the Noise of a Drum that seemed at no great Distance This Sound presently alarmed the Fears of  Partridge  and he cried out 'Lord have Mercy upon us all 'they are certainly a coming' 'Who is coming' cries  Jones  for Fear had long since given Place to softer Ideas in his Mind and since his Adventure with the lame Man he had been totally intent on pursuing  Sophia  without entertaining one Thought of an Enemy 'Who' cries  Partridge  'why the Rebels but why should I call them Rebels they may be very honest Gentlemen for any thing I know to the contrary The Devil take him that affronts them I say I am sure if they have nothing to say to me I will have nothing to say to them but in a civil Way  For Heaven's Sake Sir don't affront them if they should come and perhaps they may do us no Harm but would it not be the wiser Way to creep into some of yonder Bushes till they are gone by What can two unarmed Men do perhaps against fifty thousand Certainly nobody but a Madman I hope your Honour is not offended but certainly no Man who hath  Mens sana in Corpore sano'  Here  Jones  interrupted this Torrent of Eloquence which Fear had inspired saying  'That by the Drum he perceived they were near some Town'  He then made directly towards the Place whence the Noise proceeded bidding  Partridge  'take Courage for that he would lead him into no Danger and adding it was impossible the Rebels should be so near'  Partridge  was a little comforted with this last Assurance and though he would more gladly have gone the contrary Way he followed his Leader his Heart beating Time but not after the Manner of Heroes to the Music of the Drum which ceased not till they had traversed the Common and were come into a narrow Lane  And now  Partridge  who kept even Pace with  Jones  discovered something painted flying in the Air very few Yards before him which fancying to be the Colours of the Enemy he fell a bellowing 'O Lord Sir here they are there is the Crown and Coffin Oh Lord I never saw any Thing so terrible and we are within Gun shot of them already'  Jones  no sooner looked up than he plainly perceived what it was which  Partridge  had thus mistaken  Partridge'  says he 'I fancy you will be able to engage this whole Army yourself for by the Colours I guess what the Drum was which we heard before and which beats up for Recruits to a Puppetshow  'A Puppetshow' answered  Partridge  with most  ger Transport 'And is it really no more than  that I love a Puppetshow of all the Pastimes upon Earth Do good Sir let us tarry and see it Besides I am quite famished to Death for it is now almost dark and I have not eat a Morsel since three o'Clock in the Morning'  They now arrived at an Inn or indeed an Alehouse where  Jones  was prevailed upon to stop the rather as he had no longer any Assurance of being in the Road he desired They walked both directly into the Kitchen where  Jones  began to enquire if no Ladies had passed that Way in the Morning and  Partridge  as eagerly examined into the State of their Provisions and indeed his Enquiry met with the better Success for  Jones  could not hear News of  Sophia  but  Partridge  to his great Satisfaction found good Reason to expect very shortly the agreeable Sight of an excellent smoaking Dish of Eggs and Bacon  In strong and healthy Constitutions Love hath a very different Effect from what it causes in the puny Part of the Species In the latter it generally destroys all that Appetite which tends towards the Conservation of the Individual but in the former tho' it often induces Forgetfulness and a Neglect of Food as well as of every thing else yet place a good Piece o  wellpowered Buttock before a hungry Lover and he seldom fails very handsomely to play his Part Thus it happened in the present Case for tho'  Jones  perhaps wanted a Prompter and might have travelled much farther had he been alone with an empty Stomach yet no sooner did he sit down to the Bacon and Eggs than he fell to as heartily and voraciously a  Partridge  himself  Before our Travellers had finished their Dinner Night came on and as the Moon was now past the full it was extremely dark  Partridge  therefore prevaile on  Jones  to stay and see the Puppetshow which wa  just going to begin and to which they were very eagerly invited by the Master of the said Show who declared  that his Figures were the finest which the World had ever produced and that they had given great Satisfaction to all the Quality in every Town in  England  The Puppetshow was performed with great Regularity and Decency It was called the fine and serious Part of the  Provok'd Husband  and it was indeed a very grave and solemn Entertainment without any low Wit or Humour or Jests or to do it no more than Justice without any thing which could provoke a Laugh The Audience were all highly pleased A grave Matron told the Master she would bring her two Daughters the next Night as he did not shew any Stuff and an Attorney's Clerk and an Exciseman both declared that the Characters of Lord and Lady  Townly  were well preserved and highly in Nature  Partridge  likewise concurred with this Opinion  The Master was so highly elated with these Encomiums that he could not refrain from adding some more of his own He said  'The present Age was not improved in any Thing so much as in their Puppetshows which by throwing out Punch and his Wife  Joan  and such idle Trumpery were at last brought to be a rational Entertainment I remember' said he 'when I first took to the Business there was a great deal of low Stuff that did very well to make Folks laugh but was never calculated to improve the Morals of young People which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every Puppetshow For why may not good and instructive Lessons be conveyed this Way as well as any other My Figures are as big as the Life and they represent the Life in every particular and I question not but People rise from my little  Drama  as much improved as they do from the great I would by no Means degrade the Ingenuity of your  Profession answered  Jones  but I should have been glad to have seen my old Acquaintance Master  Punch  for all that and so far from improving I think by leaving out him and his merry Wife  Joan  you have spoiled your Puppetshow'  The Dancer of Wires conceived an immediate and high Contempt for  Jones  from these Words And with much Disdain in his Countenance he replied  'Very probably Sir that may be your Opinion but I have the Satisfaction to know the best Judges differ from you and it is impossible to please every Taste I confess indeed some of the Quality at  Bath  two or three Years ago wanted mightily to bring Punch again upon the Stage I believe I lost some Money for not agreeing to it but let others do as they will a little Matter shall never bribe me to degrade my own Profession nor will I ever willingly consent to the spoiling the Decency and Regularity of my Stage by introducing any such low Stuff upon it'  'Right Friend cries the Clerk you are very right Always avoid what is low There are several of my Acquaintance in  London  who are resolved to drive every Thing which is low from the Stage'  'Nothing can be more proper' cries the Exciseman pulling his Pipe from his Mouth 'I remember added he for I then lived with my Lord I was in the Footman's Gallery the Night when this Play of the Provok'd Husband was acted first There was a great deal of low Stuff in it about a Country Gentleman come up to Town to stand for Parliament Man and there they brought a Parcel of his Servants upon the Stage his Coachman I remember particularly but the Gentlemen in our Gallery could not bear any thing so low and they damned it I observe Friend you have left all that Matter out and you are to be commended for it'  'Nay Gentlemen cries  Jones  I can never maintain my Opinion against so many indeed if the Generality of his Audience dislike him the learned Gentleman who conducts the Show may have done very right in dismissing Punch from his Service'  The Master of the Show then began a second Harangue and said much of the great Force of Example and how much the inferior Part of Mankind would be deterred from Vice by observing how odious it was in their Superiors when he was unluckily interrupted by an Incident which though perhaps we might have omitted it at another Time we cannot help relating at present but not in this Chapter  CHAP VI  From which it may be inferred that the best Things are liable to be misunderstood and misinterpreted  A Violent Uproar now arose in the Entry where my Landlady was well cuffing her Maid both with her Fist and Tongue She had indeed missed the Wench from her Employment and after a little Search had found her on the Puppetshow Stage in Company with the  Merry Andrew  and in a Situation not very proper to be described  Tho'  Grace  for that was her Name had forfeited all Title to Modesty yet had she not Impudence enough to deny a Fact in which she was actually surprized she therefore took another Turn and attempted to mitigate the Offence  'Why do you beat me in this Manner Mistress cries the Wench If you don't like my Doings you may turn me away If I am a We for the other had liberally bestowed that Appellation on her my Betters are so as well as I What was the fine Lady in the Puppetshow  just now I suppose she did not lie all Night out from her Husband for nothing'  The Landlady now burst into the Kitchen and fell foul on both her Husband and the poor Puppetmover  'Here Husband says she you see the Consequence of harbouring these People in your House If one doth draw a little Drink the more for them one is hardly made Amends for the Litter they make and then to have one's House made a Bawdyhouse of by such lousy Vermin In short I desire you would be gone tomorrow Morning for I will tolerate no more such Doings It is only the Way to teach our Servants Idleness and Nonsense for to be sure nothing better can be learned by such idle Shows as these I remember when Puppetshows were made of good Scripture Stories as  Jephtha  's Rash Vow and such good Things and when wicked People were carried away by the Devil There was some Sense in those Matters but as the Parson told us last  Sunday  nobody believes in the Devil nowadays and here you bring about a Parcel of Puppets drest up like Lords and Ladies only to turn the Heads of poor Country Wenches and when their Heads are once turned topsy turvy no wonder every thing else is so'  Virgil  I think tells us that when the Mob are assembled in a riotous and tumultuous Manner and all Sorts of missible Weapons fly about if a Man of Gravity and Authority appears amongst them the Tumult is presently appeased and the Mob which when collected into one Body may be well compared to an Ass erect their long Ears at the grave Man's Discourse  On the contrary when a Set of grave Men and Philosophers are disputing when Wisdom herself may in a Manner be considered as present and administring Arguments to the Disputants should a Tumult arise among the Mob or should one Scold who  is herself equal in Noise to a mighty Mob appear among the said Philosophers their Disputes cease in a Moment Wisdom no longer performs her ministerial Office and the Attention of every one is immediately attracted by the Scold alone  Thus the Uproar aforesaid and the Arrival of the Landlady silenced the Master of the Puppetshew and put a speedy and final End to that grave and solemn Harangue of which we have given the Reader a sufficient Taste already Nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this Accident the most wanton Malice of Fortune could not have contrived such another Stratagem to confound the poor Fellow while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good Morals inculcated by his Exhibitions His Mouth was now as effectually stopt as that of a Quack must be if in the Midst of a Declamation on the great Virtues of his Pills and Powders the Corpse of one of his Martyrs should be brought forth and deposited before the Stage as a Testimony of his Skill  Instead therefore of answering my Landlady the Puppetshow Man ran out to punish his  Merry Andrew  and now the Moon beginning to put forth her Silver Light as the Poets call it tho' she looked at that Time more like a Piece of Copper  Jones  called for his Reckoning and ordered  Partridge  whom my Landlady had just awaked from a profound Nap to prepare for his Journey but  Partridge  having lately carried two Points as my Reader hath seen before was emboldened to attempt a third which was to prevail with  Jones  to take up a Lodging that Evening in the House where he then was He introduced this with an affected Surprize at the Intention which Mr  Jones  declared of removing and after urging many excellent Arguments against it he at last insisted strongly that it could be to no manner of Purpose whatever For that unless  Jones  knew which Way the Lady was gone every Step he took might very possibly  lead him the farther from her  'for you find Sir said he by all the People in the House that she is not gone this Way How much better therefore would it be to stay till the Moraing when we may expect to meet with Somebody to enquire of'  This last Argument had indeed some Effect on  Jones  and while he was weighing it the Landlord threw all the Rhetoric of which he was Master into the same Scale  'Sure Sir said he your Servant gives you most excellent Advice For who would travel by Night at this Time of the Year'  He then began in the usual Stile to trumpet forth the excellent Accommodation which his House afforded and my Landlady likewise opened on the OccasionBut not to detain the Reader with what is common to every Host and Hostess it is sufficient to tell him  Jones  was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh himself with a few Hours Rest which indeed he very much wanted for he had hardly shut his Eyes since he had left the Inn where the Accident of the broken Head had happened  As soon as  Jones  had taken a Resolution to proceed no farther that Night he presently retired to Rest with his two Bedfellows the PocketBook and the Muff but  Partridge  who at several Times had refreshed himself with several Naps was more inclined to Eating than to Sleeping and more to Drinking than to either  And now the Storm which  Grace  had raised being at an End and my Landlady being again reconciled to the Puppetman who on his Side forgave the indecent Reflection which the good Woman in her Passion had cast on his Performances a Face of perfect Peace and Tranquillity reigned in the Kitchen where there assembled round the Fire the Landlord and Landlady of the House the Master of the Puppetshow the Attorney's Clerk the Exciseman and the ingenious Mr  Partridge  in which Company past the  agreeable Conversation which will be found in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  Containing a Remark or two of our own and many more of the good Company assembled in the Kitchen  THOUGH the Pride of  Partridge  did not submit to acknowledge himself a Servant yet he condescended in most Particulars to imitate the Manners of that Rank One Instance of this was his greatly magnifying the Fortune of his Companion as he called  Jones  such is a general Custom with all Servants among Strangers as none of them would willingly be thought the Attendent on a Beggar For the higher the Situation of the Master is the higher consequently is that of the Man in his own Opinion the Truth of which Observation appears from the Behaviour of all the Footmen of the Nobility  But tho' Title and Fortune communicate a Splendor all around them and the Footmen of Men of Quality and of Estate think themselves entitled to a Part of that Respect which is paid to the Quality and Estates of their Masters it is clearly otherwise with Regard to Virtue and Understanding These Advantages are strictly personal and swallow themselves all the Respect which is paid to them To say the Truth this is so very little that they cannot well afford to let any others partake with them As these therefore reflect no Honour on the Domestic so neither is he at all dishonoured by the most deplorable Want of both in his Master Indeed it is otherwise in the Want of what is called Virtue in a Mistress the Consequence of which we have before seen For in this Dishonour there is a Kind of Contagion which like that of Poverty communicates itself to all who approach it  Now for these Reasons we are not to wonder that Servants I mean among the Men only should have  so great Regard for the Reputation of the Wealth of their Masters and little or none at all for their Character in other Points and that tho' they would be ashamed to be the Footman of a Beggar they are not so to attend upon a Rogue or a Blockhead and do consequently make no Scruple to spread the Fame of the Iniquities and Follies of their said Masters as far as possible and this often with great Humour and Merriment In reality a Footman is often a Wit as well as a Beau at the Expence of the Gentleman whose Livery he wears  After  Partridge  therefore had enlarged greatly on the vast Fortune to which Mr  Jones  was Heir he very freely communicated an Apprehension which he had begun to conceive the Day before and for which as we hinted at that very Time the Behaviour of  Jones  seemed to have furnished a sufficient Foundation In short he was now pretty well confirmed in an Opinion that his Master was out of his Wits with which Opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good Company round the Fire  With this Sentiment the Puppetshow Man immediately coincided  'I own said he the Gentleman surprized me very much when he talked so absurdly about Puppetshows It is indeed hardly to be conceived that any Man in his Senses should be so much mistaken what you say now accounts very well for all his monstrous Notions Poor Gentleman I am heartily concerned for him indeed he hath a strange Wildness about his Eyes which I took Notice of before tho' I did not mention it'  The Landlord agreed with this last Assertion and likewise claimed the Sagacity of having observed it  'And certainly added he it must be so for no one but a Madman would have thought of leaving so good a House to ramble about the Country at that Time of Night'  The Exciseman pulling his Pipe from his Mouth said  'He thought the Gentleman looked and talked a little wildly' and then turning to  Partridge  'If he be a Madman says he he should not be suffered to travel thus about the Country for possibly he may do some Mischief It is Pity he was not secured and sent home to his Relations'  Now some Conceits of this Kind were likewise lurking in the Mind of  Partridge  For as he was now persuaded that  Jones  had run away from Mr  Allworthy  he promised himself the highest Rewards if he could by any Means convey him back But Fear of  Jones  of whose Fierceness and Strength he had seen and indeed felt some Instances had however represented any such Scheme as impossible to be executed and had discouraged him from applying himself to form any regular Plan for the Purpose But no sooner did he hear the Sentiments of the Exciseman than he embraced that Opportunity of declaring his own and expressed a hearty Wish that such a Matter could be brought about  'Could be brought about says the Exciseman why there is nothing easier'  'Ah Sir answered  Partridge  you don't know what a Devil of a Fellow he is He can take me up with one Hand and throw me out at Window and he would too if he did but imagine'  'Pogh' says the Exciseman  'I believe I am as good a Man as he'  Besides here are five of us  'I don't know what five' cries the Landlady 'my Husband shall have nothing to do in it Nor shall any violent Hands be laid upon any Body in my House The young Gentleman is as pretty a young Gentleman as ever I saw in my Life and I believe he is no more mad than any of us What do you tell of his having a wild Look with his Eyes They are the prettiest Eyes I ever saw and he hath the  prettiest Look with them and a very modest civil young Man he is I am sure I have bepitied him heartily ever since The Gentleman there in the Corner told us he was crost in Love Certainly it is enough to make any Man especially such a sweet young Gentleman as he is to look a little otherwise than he did before Lady indeed What the Devil would the Lady have better than such a handsome Man with a great Estate I suppose she is one of your Qualityfolks one of your Townly Ladies that we saw last Night in the Puppetshow who don't know what they would be at'  The Attorney's Clerk likewise declared he would have no Concern in the Business without the Advice of Council  'Suppose syas he an Action of false Imprisonment should be brought against us what Defence could we make Who knows what may be sufficient Evidence of Madness to a Jury But I only speak upon my own Account for it don't look well for a Lawyer to be concerned in these Matters unless it be as a Lawyer Juries are always less favourable to us than to other People I don't therefore dissuade you Mr  Thompson  to the Exciseman nor the Gentleman nor any Body else'  The Exciseman shook his Head at this Speech and the PuppetshowMan said  'Madness was sometimes a difficult Matter for a Jury to decide For I remember' says he 'I was once present at a Trial of Madness where twenty Witnesses swore that the Person was as mad as a  March  Hare and twenty others that he was as much in his Senses as any Man in  England  And indeed it was the Opinion of most People that it was only a Trick of his Relations to rob the poor Man of his Right'  'Very likely cries the Landlady I myself knew a poor Gentleman who was kept in a Madhouse all his Life by his Family and they enjoyed his Estate  but it did them no Good For tho' the Law gave it them it was the Right of another'  'Pogh' cries the Clerk with great Contempt Who hath any Right but what the Law gives them If the Law gave me the best Estate in the Country I should never trouble myself much who had the Right'  'If it be so says  Partridge Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum  '  My Landlord who had been called out by the Arrival of a Horseman at the Gate now returned into the Kitchen and with an affrighted Countenance cried out  'What do you think Gentlemen the Rebels have given the Duke the Slip and are got almost to  London  It is certainly true for a Man on Horseback just now told me so'  'I am glad of it with all my Heart' cries  Partridge  'then there will be no fighting in these Parts  'I am glad cries the Clerk for a better Reason 'for I would always have Right take Place  'Ay but answered the Landlord 'I have heard some People say this Man hath no Right'  'I will prove the contrary in a Moment cries the Clerk if my Father dies seized of a Right do you mind me seized of a Right I say Doth not that Right descend to his Son And doth not one Right descend as well as another'  'But how can he have any Right to make us Papishes' says the Landlord  'Never fear that' cries  Partridge  'As to the Matter of Right the Gentleman there hath proved it as clear as the Sun and as to the Matter of Religion it is quite out of the Case The Papists themselves don't expect any such Thing A Popish Priest whom I know very well and who is a very honest Man told me upon his Word and Honour they had no such Design'  'And another Priest of my Acquaintance said the Landlady hath told me the same ThingBut my Husband is always so afraid of Papishes I know a great many Papishes that are very honest Sort of People and spend their Money very freely and it is always a Maxim with me that one Man's Money is as good as another's'  'Very true Mistress' said the PuppetshowMan I don't care what Religion comes provided the Presbyterians are not uppermost for they are Enemies to Puppetshows'  'And so you would sacrifice your Religion to your Interest' cries the Exciseman and are desirous to see Propery brought in are you'  'Not I truly' answered the other 'I hate Popery as much as any Man but yet it is a Comfort to one that one should be able to live under it which I could not do among Presbyterians To be sure every Man values his Livelihood first that must be granted and I warrant if you would confess the Truth you are more afraid of losing your Place than any Thing else but never fear Friend there will be an Excise under another Government as well as under this'  'Why certainly replied the Exciseman I should be a very ill Man if I did not honour the King whose Bread I eat That is no more than natural as a Man may say For what signifies it to me that there would be an Exciseoffice under another Government since my Friends would be out and I could expect no better than to follow them No no Friend I shall never be bubbled out of my Religion in Hopes only of keeping my Place under another Government for I should certainly be no better and very probably might be worse'  'Why that is what I say cries the Landlord whenever Folks say who knows what may happen Odsooks should not I be a Blockhead to lend my  Money to I know not who because mayhap he may return it again I am sure it is safe in my own Bureau and there I will keep it'  The Attorney's Clerk had taken a great Fancy to the Sagacity of  Partridge  Whether this proceeded from the great Discernment which the former had into Men as well as Things or whether it arose from the Sympathy between their Minds for they were both truly  Jacobites  in Principle they now shook Hands heartily and drank Bumpers of strong Beer to Healths which we think proper to bury in Oblivion  These Healths were afterwards pledged by all present and even by my Landlord himself tho' reluctantly but he could not withstand the Menaces of the Clerk who swore he would never set his Foot within his House again if he refused The Bumpers which were swallowed on this Occasion soon put an End to the Conversation Here therefore we will put an End to the Chapter  CHAP VIII  In which Fortune seems to have been in a better Humour with  Jones  than we have hitherto seen her  AS there is no wholesomer so perhaps there are few stronger Sleeping potions than Fatigue Of this  Jones  might be said to have taken a very large Dose and it operated very forcibly upon him He had already slept nine Hours and might perhaps have slept longer had he not been awaked by a most violent Noise at his Chamber Door where the Sound of many heavy Blows was accompanied with as many Exclamations of Murder  Jones  presently leapt from his Bed where he found the Master of the Puppetshow belabouring the Back and Ribs of his poor Merry Andrew without either Mercy or Moderation  Jones  instantly interposed on Behalf of the Suffering Party and pinned the insulting Conqueror up to the Wall For the PuppetshowMan was no more able to contend with  Jones  than the poor partycoloured Jester had been to contend with this Puppetman  But tho' the Merry Andrew was a little Fellow and not very strong he had nevertheless some Choler about him He therefore no sooner found himself delivered from the Enemy than he began to attack him with the only weapon at which he was his Equal From this he first discharged a Volley of general abusive Words and thence proceeded to some particular Accusations  'Dn your Bld you Rascal says he I have not only supported you for you owe all the Money you get to me but I have saved you from the Gallows Did you not want to rob the Lady of her fine RidingHabit no longer ago than Yesterday in the Backlane here Can you deny that you wished to have had her alone in a Wood to strip her to strip one of the prettiest Ladies that ever was seen in the World and here you have fallen upon me and have almost murdered me for doing no Harm to a Girl as willing as myself only because she likes me better than you'  Jones  no sooner heard this than he quitted the Master laying at the same time the most violent Injunctions of Forbearance from any further Insult on the Merry Andrew and then taking the poor Wretch with him into his own Apartment he soon learnt tidings of his  Sophia  whom the Fellow as he was attending his Master with his Drum the Day before had seen pass by He easily prevailed with the Lad to shew him the exact Place and then having summoned  Partridge  he departed with the utmost Expedition  It was almost eight of the Clock before all Matters could be got ready for his Departure For  Partridge  was not in any Haste nor could the Reckoning be presently adjusted and when both these were settled and over  Jones  would not quit the Place before he had perfectly reconciled all Differences between Master and Man  When this was happily accomplished he set forwards and was by the trusty Merry Andrew conducted to the Spot where  Sophia  had past and then having handsomely rewarded his Conductor he again pushed on with the utmost eagerness being highly delighted with the extraordinary Manner in which he received his Intelligence Of this  Partridge  was no sooner acquainted than he with great Earnestness began to prophesy and assured  Jones  that he would certainly have good Success in the End For he said 'two such Accidents could never have happened 'to direct him after his Mistress if Providence 'had not designed to bring them together at last' And this was the first Time that  Jones  lent Attention to the Superstitious Doctrines of his Companion  They had not gone above two Miles when a violent Storm of Rain overtook them and as they happened to be at the same Time in Sight of an Alehouse  Partridge  with much earnest Entreaty prevailed with  Jones  to enter and Weather the Storm  Hunger is an Enemy if indeed it may be called one which partakes more of the  English  than of the  French  Disposition for tho' you subdue this never so often it will always rally again in Time and so it did with  Partridge  who was no sooner arrived within the Kitchen than he began to ask the same Questions which he had asked the Night before The Consequence of this was an excellent cold Chine being produced upon the Table upon which not only  Partridge  but  Jones  himself made a very hearty Breakfast tho' the latter began to grow again uneasy as  the People of the House could give him no fresh Information concerning  Sophia  Their Meal being over  Jones  was again preparing to sally notwithstanding the Violence of the Storm still continued but  Partridge  begged heartily for another Mugg and at length casting his Eyes on a Lad at the Fire who had entered into the Kitchen and who at that Instant was looking as earnestly at him he turned suddenly to  Jones  and cried  'Master give me your Hand a single Mugg shan't serve the Turn this Bout Why here's more News of Madam  Sophia  come to Town The Boy there standing by the Fire is the very Lad that rid before her I can swear to my own Plaister on his Face Heavens bless you Sir cries the Boy it is your own Plaister sure enough I shall have always Reason to remember your Goodness for it hath almost cured me'  At these Words  Jones  started from his Chair and bidding the Boy follow him immediately departed from the Kitchen into a private Apartment for so delicate was he with regard to  Sophia  that he never willingly mentioned her Name in the Presence of many People and tho' he had as it were from the Overflowings of his Heart given  Sophia  as a Toast among the Officers where he thought it was impossible she should be known yet even there the Reader may remember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her Sirname  Hard therefore was it and perhaps in the Opinion of many sagacious Readers very absurd and monstrous that he should principally owe his present Misfortune to the supposed Want of that Delicacy with which he so abounded for in reality  Sophia  was much more offended at the Freedoms which she thought and not without good Reason he had taken with her Name and Character than any Freedoms in which under his present Circumstances he had  indulged himself with the Person of another Woman and to say Truth I believe  Honour  would never have prevailed on her to leave  Upton  without seeing her  Jones  had it not been for those two strong Instances of a Levity in his Behaviour so void of all Respect and indeed so highly inconsistent with any Degree of Love and Tenderness in great and delicate Minds  But so Matters fell out and so I must relate them and if any Reader is shocked at their appearing unnatural I cannot help it I must remind such Persons that I am not writing a System but a History and I am not obliged to reconcile every Matter to the received Notions concerning Truth and Nature But if this was never so easy to do perhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it For Instance as the Fact at present before us now stands without any Comment of mine upon it tho' it may at first Sight offend some Readers yet upon more mature Consideration it must please all for wise and good Men may consider what happened to  Jones  at  Upton  as a just Punishment for his Wickedness with Regard to Women of which it was indeed the immediate Consequence and silly and bad persons may comfort themselves in their Vices by flattering their own Hearts that the Characters of Men are rather owing to Accident than to Virtue Now perhaps the Reflections which we should be here inclined to draw would alike contradict both these Conclusions and would shew that these Incidents contribute only to confirm the great useful and uncommon Doctrine which it is the Purpose of this whole Work to inculcate and which we must not fill up our Pages by frequently repeating as an ordinary Parson fills his Sermon by repeating his Text at the End of every Paragraph  We are contented that it must appear however unhappily  Sophia  had erred in her Opinion of  Jones  she had sufficient Reason for her Opinion since I believe every other youngLady would in her Situation have erred in the same Manner Nay had she followed her Lover at this very Time and had entered this very Alehouse the Moment he was departed from it she would have found the Landlord as well acquainted with her Name and Person as the Wench at  Upton  had appeared to be For while  Jones  was examining his Boy in Whispers in an inner Room  Partridge  who had no such Delicacy in his Disposition was in the Kitchen very openly catechising the other Guide who attended Mrs  Fitzpatrick  by which Means the Landlord whose Ears were open enough on all such Occasions became perfectly well acquainted with the Tumble of  Sophia  from her Horse  c  with the Mistake concerning  Jenny Cameron  with the many Consequences of the Punch and in short with almost every thing which had happened at the Inn whence we dispatched our Ladies in a Coach and Six when we last took our Leaves of them  CHAP IX  Containing little more than a few odd Observations  JONES  had been absent a full half Hour when he returned into the Kitchen in a Hurry desiring the Landlord to let him know that Instant what was to pay And now the Concern which  Partridge  felt at being obliged to quit a warm Chimneycorner and a Cup of excellent Liquor was somewhat compensated by hearing he was to proceed no farther on Foot for  Jones  by Golden Arguments had prevailed with the Boy to attend him back to the Inn whither he had before conducted  Sophia  but to this however the Lad consented upon Condition that the other Guide would wait for him at the Alehouse because as the Landlord at  Upton  was an intimate Acquaintance of the  Landlord at  Gloucester  it might some Time or other come to the Ears of the latter that his Horses had been let to more than one Person and so the Boy might be brought to Account for Money which he wisely intended to put in his own Pocket  We were obliged to mention this Circumstance trifling as it may seem since it retarded Mr  Jones  a considerable Time in his setting out for the honesty of this latter Boy was somewhat highthat is somewhat highpriced and would indeed have cost  Jones  very dear had not  Partridge  who as we have said was a very cunning Fellow artfully thrown in half a Crown to be spent at that very Alehouse while the Boy was waiting for his Companion This half Crown the Landlord no sooner got Scent of than he opened after it with such vehement and persuasive Outcry that the Boy was soon overcome and consented to take half a Crown more for his Stay Here we cannot help observing that as there is so much of Policy in the lowest Life great Men often overvalue themselves on those Refinements in Imposture in which they are frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the Human Species  The Horses being now produced  Jones  directly leapt into the SideSaddle on which his dear  Sophia  had rid The Lad indeed very civilly offered him the Use of his but he chose the SideSaddle probably because it was softer  Partridge  however tho' full as effeminate as  Jones  could not bear the Thoughts of degrading his Manhood he therefore accepted the Boy's offer and now  Jones  being mounted on the SideSaddle of his  Sophia  the Boy on that of Mrs  Honour  and  Partridge  bestriding the third Horse they set forwards on their Journey and within four Hours arrived at the Inn where the Reader hath already spent so much Time  Partridge  was in very high Spirits during the whole  Way and often mentioned to  Jones  the many good Omens of his future Success which had lately befriended him and which the Reader without being the least superstitious must allow to have been peculiarly fortunate  Partridge  was moreover better pleased with the present Pursuit of his Companion than he had been with his Pursuit of Glory and from these very Omens which assured the Pedagogue of Success he likewise first acquired a clear Idea of the Amour between  Jones  and  Sophia  to which he had before given very little Attention as he had originally taken a wrong Scent concerning the Reasons of  Jones  's Departure and as to what happened at  Upton  he was too much frightened just before and after his leaving that Place to draw any other Conclusions from thence than that  Jones  was a downright Madman A conceit which was not at all disagreeable to the Opinion he before had of his extraordinary Wildness of which he thought his Behaviour on their quitting  Gloucester  so well justified all the Accounts he had formerly received He was how however pretty well satisfied with his present Expedition and henceforth began to conceive much worthier Sentiments of his Friend's Understanding  The Clock had just struck Three when they arrived and  Jones  immediately bespoke Post Horses but unluckily there was not a Horse to be procured in the whole Place which the Reader will not wonder at when he considers the Hurry in which the whole Nation and especially this Part of it was at this time engaged when Expresses were passing and repassing every Hour of the Day and Night  Jones  endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former Guide to escorte him to  Coventry  but he was inexorable While he was arguing with the Boy in the Innyard a Person came up to him and saluting him by his Name enquired how all the good Family did in  Somersetshire  and now  Jones  casting his Eyes  upon this Person presently discovered him to be Mr  Dowling  the Lawyer with whom he had dined at  Gloucester  and with much Courtesy returned his Salutation  Dowling  very earnestly pressed Mr  Jones  to go no further that Night and backed his Solicitations with many unanswerable Arguments such as that it was almost dark that the Roads were very dirty and that he would be able to travel much better by Daylight with many others equally good some of which  Jones  had probably suggested to himself before but as they were then ineffectual so they were still and he continued resolute in his Design even tho' he should be obliged to set out on Foot  When the good Attorney found he could not prevail on  Jones  to stay he as strenuously applied himself to persuade the Guide to accompany him He urged many Motives to induce him to undertake this short Journey and at last concluded with saying  'Do you think the Gentleman won't very well reward you for your Trouble'  Two to one are odds at every other thing as well as at Football But the Advantage which this united Force hath in Persuasion or Entreaty must have been visible to a curious Observer for he must have often seen that when a Father a Master a Wife or any other Person in Authority have stoutly adhered to a Denial against all the Reasons which a single Man could produce they have afterwards yielded to the Repetition of the same Sentiments by a second or third Person who hath undertaken the Cause without attempting to advance any thing new in its Behalf And hence perhaps proceeds the Phrase of seconding an Argument or a Motion and the great Consequence of which this is in all Assemblies of public Debate Hence likewise probably it is that in our Courts of Law we often hear a learned Gentleman generally a Serjeant repeating for an Hour together what another learned Gentleman who spoke before him had just been saying  Instead of accounting for this we shall proceed in our usual Manner to exemplify it in the Conduct of the Lad abovementioned who submitted to the Persuasions of Mr  Dowling  and promised once more to admit  Jones  into his SideSaddle but insisted on first giving the poor Creatures a good Bait saying they had travelled a great Ways and been rid very hard Indeed this Caution of the Boy was needless for  Jones  notwithstanding his Hurry and Impatience would have ordered this of himself for he by no Means agreed with the Opinions of those who consider Animals as mere Machines and when they bury their Spurs in the Belly of their Horse imagine the Spur and the Horse to have an equal Capacity of feeling Pain  While the Beasts were eating their Corn or rather were supposed to eat it for as the Boy was taking Care of himself in the Kitchen the Ostler took great Care that his Corn should not be consumed in the Stable Mr  Jones  at the earnest Desire of Mr  Dowling  accompanied that Gentleman into his Room where they sat down together over a Bottle of Wine  CHAP X  In which Mr  Jones  and Mr  Dowling  drink a Bottle together  MR  Dowling  pouring out a Glass of Wine named the Health of the good Squire  Allworthy  adding  'If you please Sir we will likewise remember his Nephew and Heir the young Squire Come Sir here's Mr  Blifil  to you a very pretty young Gentleman and who I dare swear will hereafter make a very considerable Figure in his Country I have a Borough for him myself in my Eye'  'Sir answered  Jones  I am convinced you don't intend to affront me so I shall not resent it but I promise you you have joined two Persons very improperly  together for one is the Glory of the humanSpecies and the other is a Rascal who dishonours the Name of a Man'  Dowling  stared at this He said 'He thought both the Gentlemen had a very unexceptionable Character  'As for Squire  Allworthy  himself says he 'I never had the Happiness to see him but all the World talks of his Goodness And indeed as to the young Gentleman I never saw him but once when I carried him the News of the Loss of his Mother and then I was so hurried and drove and tore with the Multiplicity of Business that I had hardly Time to converse with him but he looked so like a very honest Gentleman and behaved himself so prettily that I protest I never was more delighted with any Gentleman since I was born'  'I don't wonder' answered  Jones  that he should impose upon you in so short an Acquaintance for he hath the Cunning of the Devil himself and you may live with him many Years without discovering him I was bred up with him from my Infancy and we were hardly ever asunder but it is very lately only that I have discovered half the Villainy which is in him I own I never greatly liked him I thought he wanted that Generosity of Spirit which is the sure Foundation of all that is great and noble in Human Nature I saw a Selfishness in him long ago which I despised but it is lately very lately that I have found him capable of the basest and blackest Designs for indeed I have at last found out that he hath taken an Advantage of the Openness of my own Temper and hath concerted the deepest Project by a long Train of wicked Artifice to work my Ruin which at last he hath effected'  'Ay ay cries  Dowling  I protest then it is a Pity such a Person should inherit the great Estate of your Uncle  Allworthy'  'Alas Sir cries  Jones  you do me an Honour to which I have no Title It is true indeed his Goodness once allowed me the Liberty of calling him by a much nearer Name but as this was a voluntary Act of Goodness only I can complain of no Injustice when he thinks proper to deprive me of this Honour since the Loss cannot be more unmerited than the Gift originally was I assure you Sir I am no Relation of Mr  Allworthy  and if the World who are incapable of setting a true Value on his Virtue should think in his Behaviour by me he hath dealt hardly by a Relation they do an Injustice to the best of Men For Ibut I ask your Pardon I shall trouble you with no Particulars relating to myself only as you seemed to think me a Relation of Mr  Allworthy  I thought proper to set you right in a Matter that might draw some Censures upon him which I promise you I would rather lose my life than give Occasion to'  'I protest Sir cried  Dowling  you talk very much like a Man of Honour but instead of giving me any Trouble I protest it would give me great Pleasure to know how you came to be thought a Relation of Mr  Allworthy  's if you are not Your Horses won't be ready this half Hour and as you have sufficient Opportunity I wish you would tell me how all that happened for I protest it seems very surprizing that you should pass for a Relation of a Gentleman without being so'  Jones  who in the Compliance of his Disposition tho' not in his Prudence a little resembled his lovely  Sophia  was easily prevailed on to satisfy Mr  Dowling  's Curiosity by relating the History of his Birth and Education which he did like  Othello  even from his boyish Years  To th' very Moment he was bad to tell the which to hear  Dowling  like  Desdemona  did  seriousy incline  He swore 'twas strange 'twas passing strange  'Twas pitiful 'twas wonderous pitiful  Mr  Dowling  was indeed very greatly affected with this Relation for he had not divested himself of Humanity by being an Attorney Indeed nothing is more unjust than to carry our Prejudices against a Profession into private Life and to borrow our Idea of a Man from our Opinion of his Calling Habit it is true lessens the Horror of those Actions which the Profession makes necessary and consequently habitual but in all other Instances Nature works in Men of all Professions alike nay perhaps even more strongly with those who give her as it were a Holiday when they are following their ordinary Business A Butcher I make no doubt would feel Compunction at the Slaughter of a fine Horse and though a Surgeon can conceive no Pain in cutting off a Limb I have known him compassionate a Man in a Fit of the Gout The common Hangman who hath stretched the Neck of Hundreds is known to have trembled at his first Operation on a Head And the very Professors of Human Blood who in their Trade of War butcher Thousands not only of their Fellow Professors but often of Women and Children without Remorse even these I say in Times of Peace when Drums and Trumpets are laid aside often lay aside all their Ferocity and become very gentle Members of civil Society In the same Manner an Attorney may feel all the Miseries and Distresses of his Fellow Creatures provided he happens not to be concerned against them  Jones  as the Reader knows was yet unacquainted with the very black Colours in which he had been represented to Mr  Allworthy  and as to other Matters he did not shew them in the most disadvantageous Light For though he was unwilling to cast any Blame on his former Friend and Patron yet he was not very desirous of heaping too much upon himself  Dowling  therefore observed and not without Reason that very  ill Offices must have been done him by some Body  'For certainly cries he the Squire would never have disinherited you only for a few Faults which any young Gentleman might have committed Indeed I cannot properly say disinherited for to be sure by Law you cannot claim as Heir That's certain that no Body need go to Council for Yet when a Gentleman had in a Manner adopted you thus as his own Son you might reasonably have expected some considerable Part if not the Whole nay if you had expected the Whole I should not have blamed you For certainly every one is for getting as much as they can and they are not to be blamed on that Account'  'Indeed you wrong me said  Jones  'I should have been contented with very little I never had any View upon Mr  Allworthy  's Fortune nay I believe I may truly say I never once considered what he could or might give me This I solemnly declare if he had done a Prejudice to his Nephew in my Favour I would have undone it again I had rather enjoy my own Mind than the Fortune of another Man What is the poor Pride arising from a magnificent House a numerous Equipage a splendid Table and from all the other Advantages or Appearances of Fortune compared to the warm solid Content the swelling Satisfaction the thrilling Transports and the exulting Triumphs which a good Mind enjoys in the Contemplation of a generous virtuous noble benevolent Action I envy not  Blifil  in the Prospect of his Wealth nor shall I envy him in the Possession of it I would not think myself a Rascal half an Hour to exchange Situations I believe indeed Mr  Blifil  suspected me of the Views you mention and I suppose these Suspicions as they arose from the Baseness of his own Heart so they occasioned his Baseness to me But I thank Heaven I know I feelI feel my Innocence  my Friend and I would not part with that Feeling for the WorldFor as long as I know I have never done nor even designed an Injury to any Being whatever  Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis  Arbor aestiva recreatur aur a  Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque  Jupiter urget  Pone sub curru nimium propinqui  Solis in Terra domibus negata  Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo  Dulce loquentem'  Place me where never Summer Breeze  Unbinds the Glebe or warms the Trees  Where ever lowering Clouds appear  And angry  Jove  deforms th'inclement Year  Place me beneath the burning Ray  Where rolls the rapid Carr of Day  Love and the Nymph shall charm my Toils  The Nymph who sweetly speaks and sweetly smiles  Mr  Francis  He then filled a Bumper of Wine and drank it off to the Health of his dear  Lalage  and filling  Dowling  's Glass likewise up to the Brim insisted on his pledging him  'Why then here's Miss  Lalage  's Health with all my Heart cries  Dowling  I have heard her toasted often I protest though I never saw her but they say she's extremely handsome'  Though the  Latin  was not the only Part of this Speech which  Dowling  did not perfectly understand yet there was somewhat in it that made a very strong Impression upon him And though he endeavoured by winking nodding sneering and grinning to hide the Impression from  Jones  for we are as often ashamed  of thinking right as of thinking wrong it is certain he secretly approved as much of his Sentiments as he understood and really felt a very strong Impulse of Compassion for him But we may possibly take some other Opportunity of commenting upon this especially if we should happen to meet Mr  Dowling  any more in the Course of our History At present we are obliged to take our Leave of that Gentleman a little abrubtly in Imitation of Mr  Jones  who was no sooner informed by  Partridge  that his Horses were ready than he deposited his Reckoning wished his Companion a good Night mounted and set forward towards  Coventry  though the Night was dark and it just then began to rain very hard  CHAP XI  The Disasters which befel  Jones  on his Departure for  Coventry  with the sage Remarks of  Partridge  NO Road can be plainer than that from the Place they now were to  Coventry  and though neither  Jones  nor  Partridge  nor the Guide had ever travelled it before it would have been almost impossible to have missed their Way had it not been for the two Reasons mentioned in the Conclusion of the last Chapter  These two Circumstences however happening both unfortunately to intervene our Travellers deviated into a much less frequented Track and after riding full Six miles instead of arriving at the stately Spires of  Coventry  they found themselves still in a very dirty Lane where they saw no Symptoms of approaching the Suburbs of a large City  Jones  now declared that they must certainly have lost their Way but this the Guide insisted upon was impossible a Word which in common Conversation is often used not only to signify improbable but often what is really very likely and sometimes what hath certainly happened An hyperbolical Violence  like that which is so frequently offered to the Words Infinite and Eternal by the former of which it is usual to express a Distance of half a Yard and by the latter a Duration of five Minutes And thus it is as usual to assert the impossibility of losing what is already actually lost This was in fact the Case at present For notwithstanding all the confident Assertions of the Lad to the contrary it is certain they were no more in the right Road to  Coventry  than the fradulent griping cruel canting Miser is in the right Road to Heaven  It is not perhaps easy for a Reader who hath never been in those Circumstances to imagine the Horror with which Darkness Rain and Wind fill Persons who have lost their Way in the Night and who consequently have not the pleasant Prospect of warm Fires dry Cloaths and other Refreshments to support their Minds in struggling with the Inclemencies of the Weather A very imperfect Idea of this Horror will however serve sufficiently to account for the Conceits which now filled the Head of  Partridge  and which we shall presently be obliged to open  Jones  grew more and more positive that they were out of their Road and the Boy himself at last acknowledged he believed they were not in the right Road to  Coventry  tho' he affirmed at the same Time it was impossible they should have mist the Way But  Partridge  was of a different Opinion He said  'When they first set out he imagined some Mischief or other would happenDid not you observe Sir' said he to  Jones  that old Woman who stood at the Door just as you was taking Horse I wish you had given her a small Matter with all my Heart for she said then you might repent it and at that very Instant it began to rain and the Wind hath continued rising ever since Whatever some People may think I am very certain it is in the Power of Witches to raise the Wind whenever they  please I have seen it happen very often in my Time And if ever I saw a Witch in all my Life that old Woman was certainly one I thought so to myself at that very Time and if I had had any Halfpence in my Pocket I would have given her some For to be sure it is always good to be charitable to those Sort of People for Fear what may happen and many a Person hath lost his Cattle by saving a Halfpenny'  Jones  tho' he was horridly vexed at the Delay which this Mistake was likely to occasion in his Journey could not help smiling at the Superstition of his Friend whom an Accident now greatly confirmed in his Opinion This was a Tumble from his Horse by which however he received no other Injury than what the Dirt conferred on his Cloaths  Partridge  had no sooner recovered his Legs than he appealed to his Fall as conclusive Evidence of all he had asserted But  Jones  finding he was unhurt answered with a Smile  'This Witch of yours  Partridge  is a most ungrateful Jade and doth not I find distinguish her Friends from others in her Resentment If the old Lady had been angry with me for neglecting her I don't see why she should tumble you from your Horse after all the Respect you have expressed for her'  'It is ill jesting cries  Partridge  with People who have Power to do these Things for they are often very malicious I remember a Farrier who provoked one of them by asking her when the Time she had bargained with the Devil for would be out and within three Months from that very Day one of his best Cows was drowned Nor was she satisfied with that for a little Time afterwards he lost a Barrel of BestDrink For the old Witch pulled out the Spicket and let it run all over the Cellar the very first Evening he had tapped it to make merry with some of his Neighbours In  short nothing ever thrived with him afterwards for she worried the poor Man so that he took to Drinking and in a Year or two his Stock was seized and he and his Family are now come to the Parish'  The Guide and perhaps his Horse too were both so attentive to this Discourse that either thro' Want of Care or by the Malice of the Witch they were now both sprawling in the Dirt  Partridge  entirely imputed this Fall as he had done his own to the same Cause He told Mr  Jones  'it would certainly be his Turn next' and earnestly intreated him 'to return back and find out the old Woman and pacify her We shall very soon added he reach the Inn For tho' we have seemed to go forward I am very certain we are in the identical Place in which we were an Hour ago and I dare swear if it was Daylight we might now see the Inn we set out from'  Instead of returning any Answer to this sage Advice  Jones  was entirely attentive to what had happened to the Boy who received no other Hurt than what had before befallen  Pattridge  and which his Cloaths very easily bore as they had been for many Years inured to the like He soon regained his SideSaddle and by the hearty Curses and Blows which he bestowed on his Horse quickly satisfied Mr  Jones  that no Harm was done  CHAP XII  Relates that Mr  Jones  continued his Journey contrary to the Advice of  Partridge  with what happened on that Occasion  THEY now discovered a Light at some Distance to the great Pleasure of  Jones  and to the no small Terror of  Partridge  who firmly believed himself  to be bewitched and that this Light was a  Jack  with a Lanthorn or somewhat more mischievous  But how were these Fears increased when as they approached nearer to this Light or Lights as they now appeared they heard a confused Sound of Human Voices of singing laughing and hallowing together with a strange Noise that seemed to proceed from some Instruments but could hardly be allowed the Name of Music Indeed to favour a little the Opinion of  Partridge  it might very well be called Music bewitched  It is impossible to conceive a much greater Degree of Horror than what now seized on  Partridge  the Contagion of which had reached the Postboy who had been very attentive to many Things that the other had uttered He now therefore joined in petitioning  Jones  to return saying he firmly believed what  Partridge  had just before said that tho' the Horses seemed to go on they had not moved a Step forwards during at least the last half Hour  Jones  could not help smiling in the midst of his Vexation at the Fears of these poor Fellows  'Either we advance says he towards the Lights or the Lights have advanced towards us for we are now at a very little Distance from them but how can either of you be afraid of a Set of People who appear only to be merrymaking'  'Merrymaking Sir' cries  Partridge  'who could be merrymaking at this Time of Night and in such a Place and such weather They can be nothing but Ghosts or Witches or some Evil Spirits or other that's certain'  'Let them be what they will' cries  Jones  'I am resolved to go up to them and enquire the Way to  Coventry  All Witches  Partridge  are not such illnatured Hags as that we had the Misfortune to meet with last'  'Oh Lord Sir cries  Partridge  there is no knowing what Humour they will be in to be sure it is always best to be civil to them but what if we should meet with something worse than Witches with Evil Spirits themselvesPray Sir be advised pray Sir do If you had read so many terrible Accounts as I have of these Matters you would not be so FoolhardyThe Lord knows whither we have got already or whither we are going For sure such Darkness was never seen upon Earth and I question whether it can be darker in the other World'  Jones  put forwards as fast as he could notwithstanding all these Hints and Cautions and poor  Partridge  was obliged to follow For tho' he hardly dared advance he dared still less to stay behind by himself  At length they arrived at the Place whence the Lights and different Noises had issued This  Jones  perceived to be no other than a Barn where a great Number of Men and Women were assembled and were diverting themselves with much apparent Jollity  Jones  no sooner appeared before the great Doors of the Barn which were open than a masculine and very rough Voice from within demanded who was thereTo which  Jones  gently answered a Friend and immediately asked the Road to  Coventry  'If you are a Friend cries another of the Men in the Barn you had better alight till the Storm is over for indeed it was now more violent than ever you are very welcome to put up your Horse for there is sufficient Room for him at one End of the Barn'  'You are very obliging' returned  Jones  'and I will accept your Offer for a few Minutes whilst the Rain continues and here are two more who will be glad of the same Favour'  This was accorded  with more Goodwill than it was accepted For  Partridge  would rather have submitted to the utmost Inclemency of the Weather than have trusted to the Clemency of those whom he took for Hobgoblins and the poor Postboy was now infected with the same Apprehensions but they were both obliged to follow the Example of  Jones  the one because he durst not leave his Horse and the other because he feared nothing so much as being left by himself  Had this History been writ in the Days of Superstition I should have had too much Compassion for the Reader to have left him so long in Suspence whether  Beelzebub  or  Satan  was about actually to appear in Person with all his Hellish Retinue but as these Doctrines are at present very unfortunate and have but few if any Believers I have not been much aware of conveying any such Terrors To say Truth the whole Furniture of the infernal Regions hath long been appropriated by the Managers of Playhouses who seem lately to have lain them by as Rubbish capable only of affecting the Upper Gallery a Place in which few of our Readers ever sit  However tho' we do not suspect raising any great Terror on this Occasion we have Reason to fear some other Apprehensions may arise in our Reader into which we would not willingly betray him I mean that we are going to take a Voyage into Fairy Land and to introduce a Set of Beings into our History which scarce any one was ever childish enough to believe tho' many have been foolish enough to spend their Time in writing and reading their Adventures  To prevent therefore any such Suspicions so prejudicial to the Credit of an Historian who professes to draw his Materials from Nature only we shall now proceed to acquaint the Reader who these People were whose sudden Appearance had struck such Terrors  into  Partridge  had more than half frightened the PostBoy and had a little surprized even Mr  Jones  himself  The People then assembled in this Barn were no other than a Company of  Aegyptians  or as they are vulgarly called  Gypsies  and they were now celebrating the Wedding of one of their Society  It is impossible to conceive a happier Set of People than appeared here to be met together The utmost Mirth indeed shewed itself in every Countenance nor was their Ball totally void of all Order and Decorum Perhaps it had more than a Country Assembly is sometimes conducted with For these People are subject to a formal Government and Laws of their own and all pay Obedience to one great Magistrate whom they call their King  Greater Plenty likewise was no where to be seen than what flourished in this Barn Here was indeed no Nicety nor Elegance nor did the keen Appetite of the Guests require any Here was good Store of Bacon Fowls and Mutton to which every one present provided better Sauce himself than the best and dearest  French  Cook can prepare  Aeneas  is not described under more Consternation in the Temple of  Juno  Dum stupet obtutu{que} haeret defixus in uno  than was our Heroe at what he saw in this Barn While he was looking every where round him with Astonishment a venerable Person approached him with many friendly Salutations rather of too hearty a Kind to be called courtly This was no other than the King of the  Gypsies  himself He was very little distingnished in Dress from his Subjects nor had he any  Regalia  of Majesty to support his Dignity and yet there seemed as Mr  Jones  said to be somewhat in his Air which denoted Authority and inspired the Beholders with an Idea of Awe and Respect tho'  all this was perhaps imaginary in  Jones  and the Truth may be that such Ideas are incident to Power and almost inseparable from it  There was somewhat in the open Countenance and courteous Behaviour of  Jones  which being acompanied with much Comeliness of Person greatly recommended him at first Sight to every Beholder These were perhaps a little heightened in the present Instance by that profound Respect which he paid to the King of the  Gypsies  the Moment he was acquainted with his Dignity and which was the sweeter to his  Gypseian  Majesty as he was not used to receive such Homage from any but his own Subjects  The King ordered a Table to be spread with the choicest of their Provisions for his Accommodation and having placed himself at his Right Hand his Majesty began to discourse our Heroe in the following Mannner  'Me doubt not Sir but you have often seen some of my People who are what you call de Parties detache For dey go about every where but me fancy you imagine not we be so considerable Body as we be and may be you will surprise more when you hear de  Gypsy  be as orderly and well govern People as any upon Face of de Earth'  'Me have Honour as me say to be deir King and no Monarch can do boast of more dutiful Subject ne no more affectionate How far me deserve deir Goodwill me no say but dis me can say dat me never design any Ting but to do dem Good Me sall no do boast of dat neider For what can me do oderwise dan consider of de Good of dose poor People who go about all Day to give me always de best of what dey get Dey love and honour me darefore because me do love and take Care of dem dat is all me know no oder Reason'  'About a tousand or two tousand Years ago me cannot tell to a Year or two as can neider write  nor read there was a great what you calla Volution among de  Gypsy  for dere was de Lord  Gypsy  in dose Days and dese Lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de Place but de King of de  Gypsy  did demolish dem all and made all his Subject equal vid each oder and since dat time dey have agree very well for dey no tink of being King and may be it be better for dem as dey be For me assure you it be ver troublesome ting to be King and always to do Justice me have often wish to be de private  Gypsy  when me have been forced to punish my dear Friend and Relation for dough we never put to Death our Punishments be ver severe Dey make de  Gypsy  ashamed of demselves and dat be ver terrible Punishment me ave scarce ever known de  Gypsy  so punish do Harm any more'  The King then proceeded to express some Wonder that there was no such Punishment as Shame in other Governments Upon which  Jones  assured him to the contrary For there were many Crimes for which Shame was inflicted by the  English  Laws and that it was indeed one Consequence of all Punishment  'Dat be ver strange said the King For me know and hears good deal of your People dough me no live among dem and me ave often hear dat Sham is de Consequence and de Cause too of many your Rewards Are your Rewards and Punishments den de same Ting'  While his Majesty was thus discoursing with  Jones  a sudden Uproar arose in the Barn and as it seems upon this Occasion The Curtesy of these People by Degrees had removed all Apprehensions of  Partridge  and he was prevailed upon not only to stuff himself with their Food but to taste some of their Liquors which by Degrees entirely expelled all Fear from his Composition and in its Stead introduced much more agreeable Sensations  A young Female  Gypsy  more remarkable for her Wit than her Beauty had decoyed the honest Fellow aside pretending to tell his Fortune Now when they were alone together in a remote Part of the Barn whither it proceeded from the strong Liquor which is never so apt to inflame inordinate Desire as after moderate Fatigue or whither the fair  Gypsy  herself threw aside the Delicacy and Decency of her Sex and tempted the Youth  Partridge  with express Solicitations but they were discovered in a very improper Manner by the Husband of the  Gypsy  who from Jealousy it seems had kept a watchful Eye over his Wife and had dogged her to the Place where he found her in the Arms of her Gallant  To the great Coufusion of  Jones Partridge  was now hurried before the King who heard the Accusation and likewise the Culprit's Defence which was indeed very trifling For the poor Fellow was confounded by the plain Evidence which appeared against him and had very little to say for himself His Majesty then turning towards  Jones  said  'Sir you have hear what dey say what Punishment do you tink your Man deserve'  Jones  answered  'He was sorry for what had happened and that  Partridge  should make the Husband all the Amends in his Power He said he had very little Money about him at that Time and putting his Hand into his Pocket offered the Fellow a Guinea'  To which he immediately answered  He hoped his Honour would not think of giving him less than five'  This Sum after some Altercation was reduced to two and  Jones  having stipulated for the full Forgiveness of both  Partridge  and the Wife was going to pay the Money when his Majesty restraining his Hand turned to the Witness and asked him  'At what Time he had discovered the Criminals' To  which he answered That he had been desired by the Husband to watch the Motions of his Wife from her first speaking to the Stranger and that he had never lost Sight of her afterwards till the Crime had been committed' The King then asked 'If the Husband was with him all that Time in his lurking Place'  To which he answered in the Affirmative His  Aegyptian  Majesty then addressed himself to the Husband as follows  'Me be sorry to see any  Gypsy  dat have no more Honour dan to sell de Honour of his Wife for Money If you had had de Love for your Wife you would have prevented dis Matter and not endeavour to make her de Whore dat you might discover her Me do order dat you have no Money given you for you deserve Punishment not Reward me do order derefore dat you be de infamous  Gypsy  and do wear Pair of Horns upon your Forehead for one Month and dat your Wife be called de Whore and pointed at all dat Time For you be de infamous  Gypsy  but she be no less de infamous Whore'  The  Gypsies  immediately proceeded to execute the Sentence and left  Jones  and  Partridge  alone with his Majesty  Jones  greatly applauded the Justice of the Sentence upon which the King turning to him said  'Me believe you be surprize For me suppose you have ver bad Opinion of my People me suppose you tink us all de Tieves'  'I must confess Sir" said  Jones  I have not heard so favourable an Account of them as they seem to deserve'  'Me vil tell you' said the King how the Difference is between you and us My People rob your People and your People rob one anoder'  Jones  afterwards proceeded very gravely to sing forth the Happiness of those Subjects who lived under such a Magistrate  Indeed their Happiness appears to have been so compleat that we are aware lest some Advocate for arbitrary Power should hereafter quote the Case of those People as an Instance of the great Advantages which attend that Government above all others  And here we will make a concession which would not perhaps have been expected from us That no limited Form of Government is capable of rising to the same Degree of Perfection or of producing the same Benefits to Society with this Mankind have never been so happy as when the greatest Part of the then known World was under the Dominion of a single Master and this State of their Felicity continued during the Reigns of five successive Princes  Nerva Trajan Adrian  and the two  Antonini  This was the true Aera of the Golden Age and the only Golden Age which ever had any Existence unless in the warm Imaginations of the Poets from the Expulsion from  Eden  down to this Day  In reality I know but of one solid Objection to absolute Monarchy The only Defect of this excellent Constitution seems to be the Difficulty of finding any Man adequate to the Office of an absolute Monarch For this indispensably requires three Qualities very difficult as it appears from History to be found in princely Natures First a sufficient Quantity of Moderation in the Prince to be contented with all the Power which is possible for him to have dly Enough of Wisdom to know his own Happiness And dly Goodness sufficient to support the Happiness of others when not only compatible with but instrumental to his own  Now if an absolute Monarch with all these great and rare Qualifications should be allowed capable of conferring the greatest Good on Society it must be surely granted on the contrary that absolute Power vested in the Hands of one who is deficient in them all is likely to be attended with no less a Degree of Evil  In short our own Religion furnishes us with adequate Ideas of the Blessing as well as Curse which may attend absolute Power The Pictures of Heaven and of Hell will place a very lively Image of both before our Eyes For though the Prince of the latter can have no Power but what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former yet it plainly appears from Scripture that absolute Power in his infernal Dominions is granted to their Diabolical Ruler This is indeed the only absolute Power which can by Scripture be derived from Heaven If therefore the several Tyrannies upon Earth can prove any Title to a divine Authority it must be derived from this original Grant to the Prince of Darkness and these subordinate Deputations must consequently come immediately from him whose Stamp they so expresly bear  To conclude as the Examples of all Ages shew us that Mankind in general desire Power only to do Harm and when they obtain it use it for no other Purpose it is not consonant with even the least Degree of Prudence to hazard an Alteration where our Hopes are poorly kept in Countenance by only two or three Exceptions out of a thousand Instances to alarm our Fears In this Case it will be much wiser to submit to a few Inconveniencies arising from the dispassionate Deafness of Laws than to remedy them by applying to the passionate open Ears of a Tyrant  Nor can the Examples of the  Gypsies  tho' possibly they may have long been happy under this Form of Government be here urged since we must remember the very material Respect in which they differ from all other People and to which perhaps this their Happiness is entirely owing namely that they have no false Honours among them and that they look on Shame as the most grievous Punishment in the World  CHAP XIII  A Dialogue between  Jones  and  Partridge  THE honest Lovers of Liberty will we doubt not pardon that long Digression into which we were led at the Close of the last Chapter to prevent our History from being applied to the Use of the most pernicious Doctrine which Priestcraft had ever the Wickedness or the Impudence to preach  We will now proceed with Mr  Jones  who when the Storm was over took Leave of his  Egyptian  Majesty after many Thanks for his courteous Behaviour and kind Entertainment and set out for  Coventry  to which Place for it was still dark a  Gypsy  was ordered to conduct him  Jones  having by Reason of his Deviation travelled eleven Miles instead of six and most of those through very execrable Roads where no Expedition could have been made in Quest of a Midwife did not arrive at  Coventry  till near Twelve Nor could he possibly get again into the Saddle till past Two for PostHorses were now not easy to get nor were the Hostler or PostBoy in half so great a Hurry as himself but chose rather to imitate the tranquil Disposition of  Partridge  who being denied the Nourishment of Sleep took all Opportunities to supply its Place with every other Kind of Nourishment and was never better pleased than when he arrived at an Inn nor ever more dissatisfied than when he was again forced to leave it  Jones  now travelled Post we will follow him therefore according to our Custom and to the Rules of  Longinus  in the same Manner From  Coventry  he arrived at  Daventry  from  Daventry  at  Stratford  and from  Stratford  at  Dunstable  whither he came the next Day a little after Noon and within a few Hours after  Sophia  had left it and though he was obliged to stay here longer than he wished while a  Smith with great Deliberation shoed the PostHorse he was to ride he doubted not but to overtake his  Sophia  before she should set out from  St Albans  at which Place he concluded and very reasonably that his Lordship would stop and dine  And had he been right in this Conjecture he most probably would have overtaken his Angel at the aforesaid Place but unluckily my Lord had appointed a Dinner to be prepared for him at his own House in  London  and in order to enable him to reach that Place in proper Time he had ordered a Relay of Horses to meet him at  St Albans  When  Jones  therefore arrived there he was informed that the Coach and Six had set out two Hours before  If fresh PostHorses had been now ready as they were not it seemed so apparently impossible to overtake the Coach before it reached  London  that  Partridge  thought he had now a proper Opportunity to remind his Friend of a Matter which he seemed entirely to have forgotton what this was the Reader will guess when we inform him that  Jones  had eat nothing more than one poached Egg since he had left the Alehouse where he had first met the Guide returning from  Sophia  for with the Gypsies he had only feasted his Understanding  The Landlord so entirely agreed with the Opinion of Mr  Partridge  that he no sooner heard the latter desire his Friend to stay and dine than he very readily put in his Word and retracting his Promise before given of furnishing the Horses immediately he assured Mr  Jones  he would lose no Time in bespeaking a Dinner which he said could be got ready sooner than it was possible to get the Horses up from Grass and to prepare them for their Journey by a Feed of Corn  Jones  was at length prevailed on chiefly by the latter Argument of the Landlord and now a Joint of Mutton was put down to the Fire While this was  preparing  Partridge  being admitted into the same Apartment with his Friend or Master began to harangue in the following Manner  'Certainly Sir if ever Man deserved a young Lady you deserve young Madam  Western  for what a vast Quantity of Love must a Man have to be able to live upon it without any other Food as you do I am positive I have eat thirty times as much within these last twenty four Hours as your Honour and yet I am almost famished for nothing makes a Man so hungry as travelling especially in this cold raw weather And yet I can't tell how it is but your Honour is seemingly in perfect good Health and you never looked better nor fresher in your Life It must certainly be Love that you live upon'  'And very rich Diet too  Partridge'  answered  Jones  But did not Fortune send me an excellent Dainty Yesterday Dost thou imagine I cannot live more than twentyfour Hours on this dear PocketBook'  'Undoubtedly' cries  Partridge  there is enough in that PocketBook to purchase many a good Meal Fortune sent it to your Honour very opportunely for present Use as your Honour's Money must be almost out by this Time'  'What do you mean' answered  Jones  I hope you don't imagine I should be dishonest enough even if it belonged to any other Person besides Miss  Western  '  'Dishonest replied  Partridge  Heaven forbid I should wrong your Honour so much but where's the Dishonesty in borrowing a little for present spending since you will be so well able to pay the Lady hereafter No indeed I would have your Honour pay it again as soon as it is convenient by all Means but where can be the Harm in making use of it now you want it Indeed if it belonged to a poor Body it would be another  thing but so great a Lady to be sure can never want it especially now as she is along with a Lord who it can't be doubted will let her have whatever she hath need of Besides if she should wan't a little she can't want the whole therefore I would give her a little but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having found it at first and before I got some Money of my own for  London  I have heard is the very worst of Places to be in without Money Indeed if I had not known to whom it belonged I might have thought it was the Devil's Money and have been afraid to use it but as you know otherwise and came honestly by it it would be an Affront to Fortune to part with it all again at the very Time when you want it most you can hardly expect she should ever do you such another good Turn for  Fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona  You will do as you please notwithstanding all I say but for my Part I would be hanged before I mentioned a Word of the Matter'  'By what I can see  Partridge  cries  Jones  hanging is a Matter  non longe alienum à Scaevolae studiis'  You should say  alienus'  says  Partridge  I remember the Passage it is an Example under  Communis Alienus immunis variis casibus serviunt'  If you do remember it' cries  Jones  'I find you don't understand it but I tell thee Friend in plain  English  that he who finds another's Property and wilfully detains it from the known Owner deserves  in Foro Conscientiae  to be hanged no less than if he had stolen it And as for this very identical Bill which is the Property of my Angel and was once in her dear Possession I will not deliver it into any Hands but her own upon any Consideration whatever No tho' I was as hungry as thou art and had no other Means to satisfy  my craving Appetite this I hope to do before I sleep but if it should happen otherwise I charge thee if thou wouldst not incur my Displeasure for ever not to shock me any more by the bare Mention of such detestable Baseness'  'I should not have mentioned it now cries  Partridge  if it had appeared so to me for I'm sure I scorn any Wickedness as much as another but perhaps you know better and yet I might have imagined that I should not have lived so many Years and have taught School so long without being able to distinguish between  Fas Nefas  but it seems we are to live and learn I remember my oldSchoolmaster who was a prodigious great Scholar used often to say  Polly Matete cry Town is my Daskalon  The  English  of which he told us was That a Child may sometimes teach his Grandmother to suck Eggs I have lived to a fine Purpose truly if I am to be taught my Grammar at this Time of Day Perhaps young Gentleman you may change your Opinion if you live to my Years For I remember I thought myself as wise when I was a Stripling of one or two and twenty as I am now I am sure I always taught  alienus  and my Master read it so before me'  There were not many Instances in which  Partridge  could provoke  Jones  nor were there many in which  Partridge  himself could have been hurried out of his Respect Unluckily however they had both hit on one of these We have already seen  Partridge  could not bear to have his Learning attacked nor could  Jones  bear some Passage or other in the foregoing Speech And now looking upon his Companion with a contemptuous and disdainful Air a thing not usual with him he cried  'Partridge  I see thou art a conceited old Fool and I wish thou art not likewise an old Rogue Indeed if I was as well convinced of the latter as I am of the former  thou shouldst travel no farther in my Company'  The sage Pedagogue was contented with the Vent which he had already given to his Indignation and as the vulgar Phrase is immediately drew in his Horns He said He was sorry he had uttered any thing which might give Offence for that he had never intended it but  Nemo omnibus horis sapit  As  Jones  had the Vices of a warm Disposition he was entirely free from those of a cold one and if his Friends must have confest his Temper to have been a little too easily ruffled his Enemies must at the same Time have confest that it as soon subsided nor did it at all resemble the Sea whose Swelling is more violent and dangerous after a Storm is over than while the Storm itself subsists He instantly accepted the Submission of  Partridge  shook him by the Hand and with the most benign Aspect imaginable said twenty kind Things and at the same Time very severely condemned himself tho' not half so severely as he will most probably be condemned by many of our good Readers  Partridge  was now highly comforted as his Fears of having offended were at once abolished and his Pride completely satified by  Jones  's having owned himself in the wrong which Submission he instantly applied to what had principally nettled him and repeated in a muttering Voice  'To be sure Sir your Knowledge may be superior to mine in some Things but as to the Grammar I think I may challenge any Man living I think at least I have that at my Finger's Ends'  If any thing could add to the Satisfaction which the poor Man now enjoyed he received this Addition by the Arrival of an excellent Shoulder of Mutton that at this Instant came smoaking to the Table On which having both plentifully feasted they again mounted their Horses and set forward for  London  CHAP XIV  What happened to Mr  Jones  on his Journey from St  Albans  THEY were got about two Miles beyond  Barnett  and it was now the Dusk of the Evening when a genteel looking Man but upon a very shabby Horse rode up to  Jones  and asked him whether he was going to  London  to which  Jones  answered in the affirmative The Gentleman replied  'I should be obliged to you Sir if you will accept of my Company for it is very late and I am a Stranger to the Road'  Jones  readily complied with the Request and on they travelled together holding that Sort of Discourse which is usual on such Occasions  Of this indeed Robbery was the principal Topic upon which Subject the Stranger expressed great Apprehensions but  Jones  declared he had very little to lose and consequently as little to fear Here  Partridge  could not forbear putting in his Word  'Your Honour said he may think it a little but I am sure if I had a hundred Pound Bank Note in my Pocket as you have I should be very sorry to lose it but for my Part I never was less afraid in my Life for we are four of us and if we all stand by one another the best Man in  England  can't rob us Suppose he should have a Pistol he can kill but one of us and a Man can die but once that's my Comfort a Man can die but once'  Besides the Reliance on superior Numbers a kind of Valour which hath raised a certain Nation among the Moderns to a high Pitch of Glory there was another Reason for the extraordinary Courage which  Partridge  now discovered for he had at present as much of that Quality as was in the Power of Liquor to bestow  Our Company were now arrived within a Mile of  Highgate  when the Stranger turned short upon  Jones  and pulling out a Pistol demanded that little Bank Note which  Partridge  had mentioned  Jones  was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected Demand however he presently recollected himself and told the Highwayman all the Money he had in his Pocket was entirely at his Service and so saying he pulled out upwards of three Guineas and offered to deliver it but the other answered with an Oath That would not do  Jones  answered cooly He was very sorry for it and returned the Money into his Pocket  The Highwayman then threatned if he did not deliver the Bank Note that Moment he must shoot him holding his Pistol at the same Time very near to his Breast  Jones  instantly caught hold of the Fellow's Hand which trembled so that he could scarce hold the Pistol in it and turned the Muzzle from him A Struggle then ensued in which the former wrested the Pistol from the Hand of his Antagonist and both came from their Horses on the Ground together the Highwayman upon his Back and the victorious  Jones  upon him  The poor Fellow now began to implore Mercy of the Conqueror for to say the Truth he was in Strength by no Means a Match for  Jones  'Indeed Sir says he I could have had no Intention to shoot you for you will find the Pistol was not loaded This is the first Robbery I ever attempted and I have been driven by Distress to this'  At this Instant at about a hundred and fifty Yards Distance lay another Person on the Ground roaring for Mercy in a much louder Voice than the Highwayman This was no other than  Partridge  himself who endeavouring to make his Escape from the Engagement had been thrown from his Horse and  lay flat on his Face not daring to look up and expecting every Minute to be shot  In this Posture he lay till the Guide who was no otherwise concerned than for his Horses having secured the stumbling Beast came up to him and told him his Master had got the better of the Highwayman  Partridge  leapt at this News and ran back to the Place where  Jones  stood with his Sword drawn in his Hand to guard the poor Fellow which  Partridge  no sooner saw than he cried out  'Kill the Villain Sir run him through the Body kill him this Instant'  Luckily however for the poor Wretch he had fallen into more merciful Hands for  Jones  having examined the Pistol and found it to be really unloaded began to believe all the Man had told him before  Partridge  came up namely that he was a Novice in the Trade and that he had been driven to it by the Distress he mentioned the greatest indeed imaginable that of five hungry Children and Wife lying in of a sixth in the utmost Want and Misery The Truth of all which the Highwayman most vehemently asserted and offered to convince Mr  Jones  of if he would take the Trouble to go to his House which was not above two Miles off saying  'That he desired no Favour but upon Condition of proving all he had alledged'  Jones  at first pretended that he would take the Fellow at his Word and return with him declaring that his Fate should depend entirely on the Truth of his Story Upon this the poor Fellow immediately expressed so much Alacrity that  Jones  was perfectly satisfied with his Veracity and began now to entertain Sentiments of Compassion for him He returned the Fellow his empty Pistol advised him to think of honester Means of relieving his Distress and gave him a couple of Guineas for the immediate Support of his Wife and  his Family adding  'he wished he had more for his Sake but the hundred Pound that had been mentioned was not his own'  Our Readers will probably be divided in their Opinions concerning this Action some may applaud it perhaps as an Act of extraordinary Humanity while those of a more saturnine Temper will consider it as a Want of Regard to that Justice which every Man owes his Country  Partridge  certainly saw it in that Light for he testified much Dissatisfaction on the Occasion quoted an old Proverb and said He should not wonder if the Rogue attacked them again before they reached  London  The Highwayman was full of Expressions of Thankfulness and Gratitude He actually dropt Tears or pretended so to do He vowed he would immediately return home and would never afterwards commit any such Transgression whether he kept his Word or no perhaps may appear hereafter  Our Travellers having remounted their Horses arrived in Town without encountering any new mishap On the Road much pleasant Discourse passed between  Jones  and  Partridge  on the Subject of their last Adventure In which  Jones  exprest a great Compassion for those Highwaymen who are by unavoidable Distress driven as it were to such illegal Courses as generally bring them to a shameful Death  'I mean said he those only whose highest Guilt extends no farther than to Robbery and who are never guilty of Cruelty nor insult to any Person which is a Circumstance that I must say to the Honour of our Country distinguishes the Robbers of  England  from those of all other Nations for Murder is amongst those almost inseparably incident to Robbery'  'No doubt answered  Partridge  it is better to take away one's Money than one'  Life and yet it  is very hard upon honest Men that they can't travel about their Business without being in Danger of these Villains And to be sure it would be better that all Rogues were hanged out of the Way than that one honest Man should suffer For my own Part indeed I should not care to have the Blood of any of them on my own Hands but it is very proper for the Law to hang them all What Right hath any Man to take Sixpence from me unless I give it him Is there any honesty in such a Man'  'No surely cries  Jones  no more than there is in him who takes the Horses out of another Man's Stable or who applies to his own Use the Money which he finds when he knows the Right Owner'  These Hints stopt the Mouth of  Partridge  nor did he open it again till  Jones  having thrown some sarcastical Jokes on his Cowardice he offered to excuse himself on the Inequality of Fire Arms saying  'A thousand naked Men are nothing to one Pistol for though it is true it will kill but one at a single Discharge yet who can tell but that one may be himself'  The End of the Second Volume
