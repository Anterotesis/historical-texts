work and leaves themHarlequin after deploring his situation determines to kill himself and telling the Clown his intention advises him to do the samethe Clown begs to be excused but tells Harlequin he'll leave the coast clear rather than be witness to the death of his friendthis he does after taking leave in a very comic manner Harlequin being now alone considers how he had best dispatch himselfa pistol a halter and a phial of poison appear to him by the hands of three statues which rise on trapsHarlequin makes an obedience to them and first resolves to take the pistol but upon considering it will make his head ach he rejects itin like manner he refuses the poison for fear of a pain in the stomach and upon putting his hands round his throat to try the effects of strangling he will have nothing to do with the halterupon second thought however he plucks up resolution and takes the pistol when  Orosmanes appears attended by two Genii  RECITATIVE  OROSMANES  Banish thy

Harlequin comes on is struck with her charms and does every thing in his power to induce her to notice him she at last sees him falls in love with him and they are contriving how to get at each other when the chief Eunuch comes behind Zulma on the balcony and forces her away Harlequin in fear of being seen slips offThe Clown comes on describing he has searched every where for his friend to no purpose and concludes he has hanged himselfThe chief Eunuch comes on and finding the Clown lamenting a comical explanation takes place after which the Eunuch gives the Clown a letter to carry to the Sultan appointing him to come immediately and celebrate the marriage  SCENE IV A Grove  Harlequin comes and considers what he shall do to get at Zulma he touches the stump of a tree which turns into a writing desk he writes a  letter and shuts it up againHis next idea is how to send it this he effects by turning a cypress into a pigeonhouse calling down one of the pigeons and tying the letter about his neckHe describes that he has appointed Zulma to meet him at a mosque sends the pigeon away and goes off himself rejoicing at his project  SCENE V A Gallery in the Seraglio  The Clown comes on still lamenting the loss of Hariequin and yet intent upon the letter which he holds in his handAs he spells out the address he hears a noise over his head and upon looking up sees the pigeon within his reach with Harlequin's letter about his neckHe takes hold of him and laughs at the idea of the pigeon's being a lettercarrier as well as himselfupon reflection he thinks he may as well make the pigeon carry both letters and for that purpose ties the other round his neck but after considering that the pigeon may not know the direction of the letter he ought himself to carry he is determined to take it back againHere a new difficulty occurs upon a recollection that he cannot read he however upon comparing the two letters seems pretty well satisfied though it is apparent he has changed the lettersHe now wishes the pigeon a good journey who immediately flies away and the Clown goes off  SCENE VI A Garden  Harlequin comes on in anxious expectation of seeing Zulma After waiting with impatience Octar and Osmyn drag on the Clown demanding of him with threats where he got Harlequin's letter which Osmyn holds in his hand the Clown comically describes his getting it from the pigeon and Harlequin coming to see what's the matter discovers his old friend in jeopardyThe Clown spying Harlequin tells Osmyn that he is the cause of all the mischief but at the same time cannot refrain from catching him round the neck at seeing him alive Harlequin disengages himself from the Clown just at the time they are about to seize him and by a jump through a vase escapesThey all go off to find him and Harlequin coming on and finding himself alone immediately changes the scene to  SCENE VII Zulma's DressingRoom  Zulma is sitting on a sophaHarlequin apprizes her that their enemies are at hand and if she would save herself she must fly with him  They go off soon after which come on Octar Osmyn the Clown and Slaves but first the Dwarf who sees Harlequin and Zulma make their escapeThey are determined to go in pursuit of them but first Octar orders the Clown to be strangled two mutes bring on a sort of stake to which they fasten the Clown and put the cord of the bowstring about his neck but cannot pull it tight enough to strangle himThe Clown makes a hideous noise and finding the mutes do no good declares he'll strangle him himself at this moment Harlequin comes on and touching the Clown he sinks under the stage and Octar appears playing upon a doublebass the bowstring serving for the bow and the stake for the finger board the remaining part having slipt up behind Pierrot when he was surrounded by the mutesOctar finds his mistake vows vengeance against Harlequin and goes off followed by the rest being first apprized by the Dwarf which way the fugitives were gone  SCENE

after they have begged their lives upon their kneesAs the Janissaries hold each of them a jug and are hugging themselves at their expedient to get at the wine Harlequin Zulma the Clown and the English Captain come on describing that they could get no wine at the caravansera Harlequin remedies this by taking two vases which are ornaments to one of the houses and drawing off into them all the wine from the jugs held by the two Janissaries After this Harlequin Zulma the Captain and Clown go offThe Janissaries who had been eating while the above trick was playing them now begin to think of drinking but before they can get the jugs to their mouths a Dervise comes on and stops their handshe represents to them the wickedness of drinking wine they however not only coax him to forgive them but to drink with them and at last he consentsThey drink his health and hastily take the jugs from their mouths when finding they have tasted nothing but water they enquire what is the matter and in order to convince him they pour water from one jug to the other he visibly expresses surprize for a moment but recollecting himself  he tells them he performed the miracle to convince them of their impiety At last they go off in astonishment while he laughs at their credulity and goes off drinking wine out of a bottle which had been concealed under his cloak  SCENE IX The SeaCoasta Ship in the
