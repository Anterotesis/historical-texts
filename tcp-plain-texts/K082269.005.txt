 CECILIA OR MEMOIRS OF AN HEIRESS  BY THE AUTHOR OF EVELINA  IN FIVE VOLUMES  VOL V  LONDON Printed for T PAYNE and SON at the MewsGate and T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXXXII  CECILIA  BOOK IX  CHAPTER I A COGITATION  LADY Margaret Monckton received Cecilia with the most gloomy coldness she apologised for the liberty she had taken in making use of her ladyship's house but meeting no return of civility she withdrew to the room which had been prepared for her and resolved as much as possible to keep out of her sight  It now became necessary without further delay to settle her plan of life and fix her place of residence The forbidding looks of Lady Margaret made her hasten her resolves which otherwise would for a while  have given way to grief for her recent misfortune  She sent for the surveyor who had the superintendance of her estates to enquire how soon her own house would be fit for her reception and heard there was yet work for near two months  This answer made her very uncomfortable To continue two months under the roof with Lady Margaret was a penance she could not enjoin herself nor was she at all sure Lady Margaret would submit to it any better she determined therefore to release herself from the conscious burthen of being an unwelcome visitor by boarding with some creditable family at Bury and devoting the two months in which she was to be kept from her house to a general arrangement of her affairs and a final settling with her guardians  For these purposes it would be necessary she should go to London but with whom or in what manner she could not decide She desired therefore another conference with Mr Monckton who met her in the parlour  She then communicated to him her schemes and begged his counsel in her perplexities  He was delighted at the application and extremely well pleased with her design of  boarding at Bury well knowing he could then watch and visit her at his pleasure and have far more comfort in her society than even in his own house where all the vigilance with which he observed her was short of that with which he was himself observed by Lady Margaret He endeavoured however to dissuade her from going to town but her eagerness to pay the large sum she owed him was now too great to be conquered Of age her fortune wholly in her power and all attendance upon Mrs Charlton at an end she had no longer any excuse for having a debt in the world and would suffer no persuasion to make her begin her career in life with a negligence in settling her accounts which she had so often censured in others To go to London therefore she was fixed and all that she desired was his advice concerning the journey  He then told her that in order to settle with her guardians she must write to them in form to demand an account of the sums that had been expended during her minority and announce her intention for the future to take the management of her fortune into her own hands  She immediately followed his directions and consented to remain at the grove till their answers arrived  Being now therefore unavoidably fixed  for some time at the house she thought it proper and decent to attempt softening Lady Margaret in her favour She exerted all her powers to please and to oblige her but the exertion was necessarily vain not only from the disposition but the situation of her ladyship since every effort made for this conciliatory purpose rendered her doubly amiable in the eyes of her husband and consequently to herself more odious than ever Her jealousy already but too well founded received every hour the poisonous nourishment of fresh conviction which so much soured and exasperated a temper naturally harsh that her malignity and illhumour grew daily more acrimonious Nor would she have contented herself with displaying this irascibility by general moroseness had not the same suspicious watchfulness which discovered to her the passion of her husband served equally to make manifest the indifference and innocence of Cecilia to reproach her therefore she had not any pretence though her knowledge how much she had to dread her past current in her mind for sufficient reason to hate her The Angry and the Violent use little discrimination whom they like they enquire not if they approve but whoever no matter how unwittingly stands in their way  they scruple not to ill use and conclude they may laudably detest  Cecilia though much disgusted gave not over her attempt which she considered but as her due while she continued in her house Her general character also for peevishness and haughty illbreeding skilfully from time to time displayed and artfully repined at by Mr Monckton still kept her from suspecting any peculiar animosity to herself and made her impute all that passed to the mere rancour of illhumour She confined herself however as much as possible to her own apartment where her sorrow for Mrs Charlton almost hourly encreased by the comparison she was forced upon making of her house with the grove  That worthy old lady left her granddaughters her coheiresses and sole executrixes She bequeathed from them nothing considerable though she left some donations for the poor and several of her friends were remembered by small legacies Among them Cecilia had her picture and favourite trinkets with a paragraph in her will that as there was no one she so much loved had her fortune been less splendid she should have shared with her granddaughters whatever she had to bestow  Cecilia was much affected by this last and  solemn remembrance She more than ever coveted to be alone that she might grieve undisturbed and she lamented without ceasing the fatigue and the illness which in so late a period at it proved of her life she had herself been the means of occasioning to her  Mr Monckton had too much prudence to interrupt this desire of solitude which indeed cost him little pain as he considered her least in danger when alone She received in about a week answers from both her guardians Mr Delvile's letter was closely to the purpose without a word but of business and couched in the haughtiest terms As he had never he said acted he had no accounts to send in but as he was going to town in a few days he would see her for a moment in the presence of Mr Briggs that a joint release might be signed to prevent any future application to him  Cecilia much lamented there was any necessity for her seeing him at all and looked forward to the interview as the greatest mortification she could suffer  Mr Briggs though still more concise was far kinder in his language but he advised her to defer her scheme of taking the money into her own hands assuring her she would be cheated and had better leave it to him  When she communicated these epistles to Mr Monckton he failed not to read with an emphasis by which his arrogant meaning was still more arrogantly enforced the letter of Mr Delvile aloud Nor was he sparing in comments that might render it yet more offensive Cecilia neither concurred in what he said nor opposed it but contented herself when he was silent with producing the other letter  Mr Monckton read not this with more favour He openly attacked the character of Briggs as covetous rapacious and overreaching and warned her by no means to abide by his counsel without first taking the opinion of some disinterested person He then stated the various arts which might be practised upon her inexperience enumerated the dangers to which her ignorance of business exposed her and annotated upon the cheats double dealings and tricks of stock jobbing to which he assured her Mr Briggs owed all he was worth till perplexed and confounded she declared herself at a loss how to proceed and earnestly regretted that she could not have his counsel upon the spot  This was his aim to draw the wish from her drew all suspicion of selfish views from himself and he told her that he considered her present situation as so critical  the future confusion or regularity of her money transactions seeming to depend upon it that he would endeavour to arrange his affairs for meeting her in London  Cecilia gave him many thanks for the kind intention and determined to be totally guided by him in the disposal and direction of her fortune  Mean time he had now another part to act he saw that with Cecilia nothing more remained to be done and that harbouring not a doubt of his motives she thought his design in her favour did her nothing but honour but he had too much knowledge of the world to believe it would judge him in the same manner and too much consciousness of duplicity to set its judgment at defiance To parry therefore the conjectures which might follow his attending her he had already prepared Lady Margaret to wish herself of the party for however disagreeable to him was her presence and her company he had no other means to be under the same roof with Cecilia  Miss Bennet the wretched tool of his various schemes and the mean sycophant of his lady had been employed by him to work upon her jealousy by secretly informing her of his intention to go to town at the same time that Cecilia went thither to meet her guardians She pretended to have  learned this intelligence by accident and to communicate it from respectful regard and advised her to go to London herself at the same time that she might see into his designs and be some check upon his pleasure  The encreasing infirmities of Lady Margaret made this counsel by no means palatable but Miss Bennet following the artful instructions which she received put in her way so strong a motive by assuring her how little her company was wished that in the madness of her spite she determined upon the journey And little heeding how she tormented herself while she had any view of tormenting Mr Monckton she was led on by her false confident to invite Cecilia to her town house  Mr Monckton in whom by long practice artifice was almost nature well knowing his wife's perverseness affected to look much disconcerted at the proposal while Cecilia by no means thinking it necessary to extend her compliance to such a punishment instantly made an apology and declined the invitation  Lady Margaret little versed in civility and unused to the arts of persuasion could not even for a favourite project prevail upon herself to use entreaty and therefore thinking her scheme defeated looked gloomily disappointed and said nothing more  Mr Monckton saw with delight how much this difficulty inflamed her though the moment he could speak alone with Cecilia he made it his care to remove it  He represented to her that however privately she might live she was too young to be in London lodgings by herself and gave an hint which she could not but understand that in going or in staying with only servants suspicions might soon be raised that the plan and motive of her journey were different to those given out  She knew he meant to insinuate that it would be conjectured she designed to meet Delvile and though colouring vext and provoked at the suggestion the idea was sufficient to frighten her into his plan  In a few days therefore the matter was wholly arranged Mr Monckton by his skill and address leading every one whither he pleased while by the artful coolness of his manner he appeared but to follow himself He sat out the day before though earnestly wishing to accompany them but having as yet in no single instance gone to town in the same carriage with Lady Margaret he dared trust neither the neighbourhood nor the servants with so dangerous a subject for their comments  Cecilia compelled thus to travel with only her Ladyship and Miss Bennet had a  journey the most disagreeable and determined if possible to stay in London but two days She had already fixed upon a house in which she could board at Bury when she returned and there she meant quietly to reside till she could enter her own  Lady Margaret herself exhilarated by a notion of having outwitted her husband was in unusual good spirits and almost in good humour The idea of thwarting his designs and being in the way of his entertainment gave to her a delight she had seldom received from any thing and the belief that this was effected by the superiority of her cunning doubled her contentment and raised it to exultation She owed him indeed much provocation and uneasiness and was happy in this opportunity of paying her arrears  Mean while that consummate master in every species of hypocrisy indulged her in this notion by the air of dissatisfaction with which he left the house It was not that she meant by her presence to obviate any impropriety early and long acquainted with the character of Cecilia she well knew that during her life the passion of her husband must be confined to his own breast but conscious of his aversion to herself which she resented with the bitterest illwill and  knowing how little at any time he desired her company she consoled herself for her inability to give pleasure by the power she possessed of giving pain and bore with the fatigue of a journey disagreeable and inconvenient to her with no other view than the hope of breaking into his plan of avoiding her Little imagining that the whole time she was forwaring his favourite pursuit and only acting the part which he had appointed her to perform  CHAP II A SURPRIZE  LADY Margaret's town house was in Soho Square and scarcely had Cecilia entered it before her desire to speed her departure made her send a note to each of her guardians acquainting them of her arrival and begging if possible to see them the next day  She had soon the two following answers  TO Miss CECILIA BEVERLEY  These  November  Miss  Received yours of the same date can't come tomorrow Will Wednesday the th  Am c JN  o  BRIGGS  Miss Cecilia Beverley  TO Miss BEVERLEY  Mr Delvile has too many affairs of importance upon his hands to make any appointment  till he has deliberated how to arrange them Mr Delvile will acquaint Miss Beverley when it shall be in his power to see her  St James'sSquare  Nov  These characteristic letters which at another time might have diverted Cecilia now merely served to torment her She was eager to quit town she was more eager to have her meeting with Mr Delvile over who oppressive to her even when he meant to be kind she foresaw now he was in wrath would be imperious even to rudeness Desirous however to make one interview suffice for both and to settle whatever business might remain unfinished by letters she again wrote to Mr Briggs whom she had not spirits to encounter without absolute necessity and informing him of Mr Delvile's delay begged he would not trouble himself to call till he heard from her adain  Two days passed without any message from them they were spent chiefly alone and very uncomfortably Mr Monckton being content to see little of her while he knew she saw nothing of any body else On the third morning weary of her own thoughts weary of Lady Margaret's illhumoured looks and still more weary of  Miss Bennet's parasitical conversation she determined for a little relief to the heaviness of her mind to go to her bookseller and look over and order into the country such new publications as seemed to promise her any pleasure  She sent therefore for a chair and glad to have devised for herself any amusement set out in it immediately  Upon entering the shop she saw the Bookseller engaged in close conference with a man meanly dressed and much muffled up who seemed talking to him with uncommon earnestness and just as she was approaching said  "To terms I am indifferent for writing is no labour to me on the contrary it is the first delight of my life and therefore and not for dirty pelf I wish to make it my profession"  The speech struck Cecilia but the voice struck her more it was Belfield's and her amazement was so great that she stopt short to look at him without heeding a man who attended her and desired to know her commands  The bookseller now perceiving her came forward and Belfield turning to see who interrupted them started as if a spectre had crossed his eyes flapped his hat over his face and hastily went out of the shop  Cecilia checking her inclination to speak  to him from observing his eagerness to escape her soon recollected her own errand and employed herself in looking over new books  Her surprize however at a change so sudden in the condition of this young man and at a declaration of a passion for writing so opposite to all the sentiments which he had professed at their late meeting in the cottage awakened in her a strong curiosity to be informed of his situation and after putting aside some books which she desired to have packed up for her she asked if the gentleman who had just left the shop and who she found by what he had said was an Author had written any thing that was published with his name  "No ma'am"  answered the Bookseller  "nothing of any consequence he is known however to have written several things that have appeared as anonymous and I fancy now soon we shall see something considerable from him"  "He is about some great work then"  "Why no not exactly that perhaps at present we must feel our way with some little smart  jeu d'esprit  before we undertake a great work But he is a very great genius and I doubt not will produce something extraordinary"  "Whatever he produces"  said Cecilia  "as I have now chanced to see him I shall be glad you will at any time send to me"  "Certainly ma'am but it must be among other things for he does not chuse just now to be known and it is a rule in our business never to tell people's names when they desire to be secret He is a little out of cash just now as you may suppose by his appearance so instead of buying books he comes to sell them However he has taken a very good road to bring himself home again for we pay very handsomely for things of any merit especially if they deal smartly in a few touches of the times"  Cecilia chose not to risk any further questions lest her knowledge of him should be suspected but got into her chair and returned to Lady Margaret's  The sight of Belfield reminded her not only of himself the gentle Henrietta again took her place in her memory whence her various distresses and suspences had of late driven from it every body but Delvile and those whom Delvile brought into it But her regard for that amiable girl though sunk in the busy scenes of her calamitous uncertainties was only sunk in her own bosom and ready upon their removal to revive with fresh vigour She was now indeed more unhappy than even in the period  of her forgetfulness yet her mind was no longer filled with the restless turbulence of hope which still more than despondency unfitted it for thinking of others  This remembrance thus awakened awakened also a desire of renewing the connection so long neglected All scruples concerning Delvile had now lost their foundation since the doubts from which they arose were both explained and removed she was certain alike of his indifference to Henrietta and his separation from herself she knew that nothing was to be feared from painful or offensive rivalry and she resolved therefore to lose no time in seeking the first pleasure to which since her disappointment she had voluntarily looked forward  Early in the evening she told Lady Margaret she was going out for an hour or two and sending again for a chair was carried to PortlandStreet  She enquired for Miss Belfield and was shewn into a parlour where she found her drinking tea with her mother and Mr Hobson their landlord  Henrietta almost screamed at her sight from a sudden impulse of joy and surprize and running up to her flung her arms round her neck and embraced her with the most rapturous emotion but then drawing back with a look of timidity and shame  she bashfully apologized for her freedom saying  "Indeed dearest Miss Beverley it is no want of respect but I am so very glad to see you it makes me quite forget myself"  Cecilia charmed at a reception so ingenuously affectionate soon satisfied her doubting diffidence by the warmest thanks that she had preserved so much regard for her and by doubling the kindness with which she returned her caresses  "Mercy on me madam"  cried Mrs Belfield who during this time had been busily employed in sweeping the hearth wiping some slops upon the table and smoothing her handkerchief and apron  "why the girl's enough to smother you Henny how can you be so troublesome I never saw you behave in this way before"  "Miss Beverley madam"  said Henrietta again retreating  "is so kind as to pardon me and I was so much surprised at seeing her that I hardly knew what I was about"  "The young ladies ma'am"  said Mr Hobson  "have a mighty way of saluting one another till such time as they get husbands and then I'll warrant you they can meet without any salutation at all That's my remark at least and what I've seen of the world has set me upon making it"  This speech led Cecilia to check however  artless the tenderness of her fervent young friend whom she was much teized by meeting in such company but who seemed not to dare understand the frequent looks which she gave her expressive of a wish to be alone with her  "Come ladies"  continued the facetious Mr Hobson  "what if we were all to sit down and have a good dish of tea and suppose Mrs Belfield you was to order us a fresh round of toast and butter do you think the young ladies here would have any objection and what if we were to have a little more water in the teakettle not forgetting a little more tea in the teapot What I say is this let us all be comfortable that's my notion of things"  "And a very good notion too"  said Mrs Belfield  "for you who have nothing to vex you Ah ma'am you have heard I suppose about my son gone off nobody knows where left that lord's house where he might have lived like a king and gone out into the wide world nobody knows for what"  "Indeed"  said Cecilia who from seeing him in London concluded he was again with his family  "and has he not acquainted you where he is"  "No ma'am no"  cried Mrs Belfield  he's never once told me where he is gone  nor let me know the least about the matter for if I did I would not taste a dish of tea again for a twelvemonth till I saw him get back again to that lord's and I believe in my heart there's never such another in the three kingdoms for he has sent here after him I dare say a score of times And no wonder for I will take upon me to say he won't find his fellow in a hurry Lord as he is"  "As to his being a Lord"  said Mr Hobson  "I am one of them that lay no great stress upon that unless he has got a good long purse of his own and then to be sure a Lord's no bad thing But as to the matter of saying Lord such a one how d'ye do and Lord such a one what do you want and such sort of compliments why in my mind it's a mere nothing in comparison of a good income As to your son ma'am he did not go the right way to work He should have begun with business and gone into pleasure afterwards and if he had but done that I'll be bold to say we might have had him at this very minute drinking tea with us over this fireside"  "My son Sir"  said Mrs Belfield rather angrily  "was another sort of a person than a person of business he always despised  it from a child and come of it what may I am sure he was born to be a gentleman"  "As to his despising business"  said Mr Hobson very contemptuously  "why so much the worse for business is no such despiseable thing And if he had been brought up behind a counter instead of dangling after these same Lords why he might have had a house of his own over his head and been as good a man as myself"  "A house over his head"  said Mrs Belfield  "why he might have had what he would and have done what he would if he had but followed my advice and put himself a little forward I have told him a hundred times to ask some of those great people he lived amongst for a place at court for I know they've so many they hardly know what to do with them and it was always my design from the beginning that he should be something of a great man but I never could persuade him though for any thing I know as I have often told him if he had but had a little courage he might have been an Ambassador by this time And now all of a sudden to be gone nobody knows where"  "I am sorry indeed"  said Cecilia who knew not whether most to pity or wonder at her blind folly  "but I doubt not you will hear of him soon"  "As to being an Ambassador ma'am"  said Mr Hobson  "it's talking quite out of character Those sort of great people keep things of that kind for their own poor relations and cousins What I say is this a man's best way is to take care of himself The more those great people see you want them the less they like your company Let every man be brought up to business and then when he's made his fortune he may walk with his hat on Why now there was your friend ma'am"  turning to Cecilia  "that shot out his brains without paying any body a souse pray how was that being more genteel than standing behind a counter and not owing a shilling"  "Do you think a young lady"  cried Mrs Belfield warmly  "can bear to hear of such a thing as standing behind a counter I am sure if my son had ever done it I should not expect any lady would so much as look at him And yet though I say it she might look a good while and not see many such persons let her look where she pleased And then he has such a winning manner into the bargain that I believe in my heart there's never a lady in the land could say no to him And yet he has such a prodigious shyness I never could make him own he had so much as  asked the question And what lady can begin first"  "Why no"  said Mr Hobson  "that would be out of character another way Now my notion is this let every man be agreeable and then he may ask what lady he pleases And when he's a mind of a lady he should look upon a frown or two as nothing for the ladies frown in courtship as a thing of course it's just like a man's swearing at a coachman why he's not a bit more in a passion only he thinks he sha'n't be minded without it"  "Well for my part"  said Mrs Belfield  "I am sure if I was a young lady and most especially if I was a young lady of fortune and all that I should like a modest young gentleman such as my son for example better by half than a bold swearing young fellow that would make a point to have me whether I would or no"  "Ha Ha Ha"  cried Mr Hobson  "but the young ladies are not of that way of thinking they are all for a little life and spirit Don't I say right young ladies"  Cecilia who could not but perceive that these speeches was levelled at herself felt offended and tired and finding she had no chance of any private conversation with Henrietta arose to take leave but while  she stopped in the passage to enquire when she could see her alone a footman knocked at the door who having asked if Mr Belfield lodged there and been answered in the affirmative begged to know whether Miss Beverley was then in the house  Cecilia much surprised went forward and told him who she was  "I have been madam"  said he  "with a message to you at Mr Monckton's in SohoSquare but nobody knew where you was and Mr Monckton came out and spoke to me himself and said that all he could suppose was that you might be at this house So he directed me to come here"  "And from whom Sir is your message"  "From the honourable Mr Delvile madam in St James'sSquare He desires to know if you shall be at home on Saturday morning the day after tomorrow and whether you can appoint Mr Briggs to meet him by twelve o'clock exactly as he sha'n't be able to stay above three minutes"  Cecilia gave an answer as cold as the message that she would be in SohoSquare at the time he mentioned and acquaint Mr Briggs of his intention  The footman then went away and Henrietta told her that if she could call some morning she might perhaps contrive to be alone  with her and added  "indeed I wish much to see you if you could possibly do me so great an honour for I am very miserable and have nobody to tell so Ah Miss Beverley you that have so many friends and that deserve as many again you little know what a hard thing it is to have nonebut my brother's strange disappearing has half broke our hearts"  Cecilia was beginning a consolatory speech in which she meant to give her private assurances of his health and safety when she was interrupted by Mr Albany who came suddenly into the passage  Henrietta received him with a look of pleasure and enquired why he had so long been absent but surprised by the sight of Cecilia he exclaimed without answering her  "why didst thou fail me why appoint me to a place thou wert quitting thyselfthou thing of  air professions thou inveigler of esteem thou vain delusive promiser of pleasure"  "You condemn me too hastily"  said Cecilia  "if I failed in my promise it was not owing to caprice or insincerity but to real and bitter misfortune which incapacitated me from keeping it I shall soon howevernay I am already at your disposal if you have any commands for me"  "I have always"  answered he  "commands  for the rich for I have always compassion for the poor"  "Come to me then at Mr Monckton's in SohoSquare"  cried she and hastened into her chair impatient to end a conference which she saw excited the wonder of the servants and which also now drew out from the parlour Mr Hobson and Mrs Belfield She then kissed her hand to Henrietta and ordered the chairmen to carry her home  It had not been without difficulty that she had restrained herself from mentioning what she knew of Belfield when she found his mother and sister in a state of such painful uncertainty concerning him But her utter ignorance of his plans joined to her undoubted knowledge of his wish of concealment made her fear doing mischief by officiousness and think it wiser not to betray what she had seen of him till better informed of his own views and intentions Yet willing to shorten a suspence so uneasy to them she determined to entreat Mr Monckton would endeavour to find him out and acquaint him with their anxiety  That gentleman when she returned to his house was in a state of mind by no means enviable Missing her at tea he had asked Miss Bennet where she was and hearing  she had not left word he could scarce conceal his chagrin Knowing however how few were her acquaintances in town he soon concluded she was with Miss Belfield but not satisfied with sending Mr Delvile's messenger after her he privately employed one in whom he trusted for himself to make enquiries at the house without saying whence he came  But though this man was returned and he knew her safety he still felt alarmed he had flattered himself from the length of time in which she had now done nothing without consulting him she would scarce even think of any action without his previous concurrence And he had hoped by a little longer use to make his counsel become necessary which he knew to be a very short step from rendering it absolute  Nor was he well pleased to perceive by this voluntary excursion a struggle to cast off her sadness and a wish to procure herself entertainment it was not that he desired her misery but he was earnest that all relief from it should spring from himself and though far from displeased that Delvile should lose his sovereignty over her thoughts he was yet of opinion that till his own liberty was restored he had less to apprehend from grief indulged than grief allayed  one could but lead her to repining retirement the other might guide her to a consolatory rival  He well knew however it was as essential to his cause to disguise his disappointments as his expectations and certain that by pleasing alone he had any chance of acquiring power he cleared up when Cecilia returned who as unconscious of feeling as of owing any subjection to him preserved uncontrolled the right of acting for herself however desirous and glad of occasional instruction  She told him where she had been and related her meeting Belfield and the unhappiness of his friends and hinted her wish that he could be informed what they suffered Mr Monckton eager to oblige her went instantly in search of him and returning to supper told her he had traced him through the Bookseller who had not the dexterity to parry his artful enquiries and had actually appointed him to breakfast in SohoSquare the next morning  He had found him he said writing but in high spirits and good humour He had resisted for a while his invitation on account of his dress all his clothes but the very coat which he had on being packed up and at his mother's but when laughed at by Mr Monckton for still retaining some foppery  he gayly protested what remained of it should be extinguished and acknowledging that his shame was no part of his philosophy declared he would throw it wholly aside and in spite of his degradation renew his visits at his house  "I would not tell him"  Mr Monckton continued  "of the anxiety of his family I thought it would come more powerfully from yourself who having seen can better enforce it"  Cecilia was very thankful for this compliance with her request and anticipated the pleasure she hoped soon to give Henrietta by the restoration of a brother so much loved and so regretted  She sent mean time to Mr Briggs the message she had received from Mr Delvile and had the satisfaction of an answer that he would observe the appointment  CHAP III A CONFABULATION  THE next morning while the family was at breakfast Belfield according to his promise made his visit  A high colour overspread his face as he entered the room resulting from a sensation of grief at his fallen fortune and shame at his altered appearance which though he endeavoured to cover under an air of gaiety and unconcern gave an awkwardness to his manners and a visible distress to his countenance Mr Monckton received him with pleasure and Cecilia who saw the conflict of his philosophy with his pride dressed her features once more in smiles which however faint and heartless shewed her desire to reassure him Miss Bennet as usual when not called upon by the master or lady of the house sat as a cypher and Lady Margaret always disagreeable and repulsive to the friends of her husband though she was not now more than commonly ungracious struck the quickfeeling and irritable Belfield to wear an air of rude  superiority meant to reproach him with his disgrace  This notion which strongly affected him made him for one instant hesitate whether he should remain another in the same room with her but the friendliness of Mr Monckton and the gentleness and good breeding of Cecilia seemed so studious to make amends for her moroseness that he checked his too ready indignation and took his seat at the table Yet was it some time before he could recover even the assumed vivacity which this suspected insult had robbed him of sufficiently to enter into conversation with any appearance of ease or pleasure But after a while soothed by the attentions of Cecilia and Mr Monckton his uneasiness wore off and the native spirit and liveliness of his character broke forth with their accustomed energy  "This good company I hope"  said he addressing himself however only to Cecilia  "will not so much  mistake the thing  as to criticise my dress of this morning since it is perfectly according to rule and to rule established from time immemorial but lest any of you should so much err as to fancy shabby what is only characteristic I must endeavour to be beforehand with the malice of conjecture and have the honour to inform you that I am enlisted in  the GrubStreet regiment of the third story and under the tattered banner of scribbling volunteers a race which if it boasts not the courage of heroes at least equals them in enmity This coat therefore is merely the uniform of my corps and you will all I hope respect it as emblematical of wit and erudition"  "We must at least respect you"  said Cecilia  "who thus gaily can sport with it"  "Ah madam"  said he more seriously  "it is not from you I ought to look for respect I must appear to you the most unsteady and cowardhearted of beings But lately I blushed to see you from poverty though more worthily employed than when I had been seen by you in affluence that shame vanquished another equally narrow took its place and yesterday I blushed again that you detected me in a new pursuit though I had only quitted my former one from a conviction it was ill chosen There seems in human nature a worthlessness not to be conquered yet I will struggle with it to the last and either die in the attempt or dare seem that which I am without adding to the miseries of life the sting the envenomed sting of dastardly false shame"  "Your language is wonderfully altered  within this twelvemonth"  said Mr Monckton  "the  worthlessness of human nature  the  miseries of life  this from you so lately the champion of human nature and the panegyrist of human life"  "Soured by personal disappointment"  answered he  "I may perhaps speak with too much acrimony yet ultimately my opinions have not much changed Happiness is given to us with more liberality than we are willing to confess it is judgment only that is dealt us sparingly and of that we have so little that when felicity is before us we turn to the right or left or when at the right or left we proceed strait forward It has been so with me I have sought it at a distance amidst difficulty and danger when all that I could wish has been immediately within my grasp"  "It must be owned"  said Mr Monckton  "after what you have suffered from this world you were wont to defend there is little reason to wonder at some change in your opinion"  "Yet whatever have been my sufferings"  he answered  "I have generally been involved in them by my own rashness or caprice My last enterprise especially from which my expectations were highest was the most ill judged of any I considered not how little my way of life had fitted me  for the experiment I was making how irreparably I was enervated by long sedentary habits and how insufficient for bodily strength was mental resolution We may fight against partial prejudices and by spirit and fortitude we may over come them but it will not do to war with the general tenor of education We may blame despise regret as we please but customs long established and habits long indulged assume an empire despotic though their power is but prescriptive Opposing them is vain Nature herself when forced aside is not more elastic in her rebound"  "Will you not then"  said Cecilia  "since your experiment has failed return again to your family and to the plan of life you formerly settled"  "You speak of them together"  said he with a smile  "as if you thought them inseparable and indeed my own apprehension they would be deemed so has made me thus fear to see my friends since I love not resistance yet cannot again attempt the plan of life they would have me pursue I have given up my cottage but my independence is as dear to me as ever and all that I have gathered from experience is to maintain it by those employments for which my education has fitted me instead of seeking  it injudiciously by the very road for which it has unqualified me"  "And what is this independence"  cried Mr Monckton  "which has thus bewitched your imagination a mere idle dream of romance and enthusiasm without existence in nature without possibility in life In uncivilised countries or in lawless times independence for a while may perhaps stalk abroad but in a regular government 'tis only the vision of a heated brain one part of a community must inevitably hang upon another and 'tis a farce to call either independent when to break the chain by which they are linked would prove destruction to both The soldier wants not the officer more than the officer the soldier nor the tenant the landlord more than the landlord the tenant The rich owe their distinction their luxuries to the poor as much as the poor owe their rewards their necessaries to the rich"  "Man treated as an Automaton"  answered Belfield  "and considered merely with respect to his bodily operations may indeed be called dependent since the food by which he lives or rather without which he dies cannot wholly be cultivated and prepared by his own hands but considered  n a nobler sense he deserves not the degrading epithet speak of him then as a  being of feeling and understanding with pride to alarm with nerves to tremble with honour to satisfy and with a soul to be immortalas such may he not claim the freedom of his own thoughts may not that claim be extended to the liberty of speaking and the power of being governed by them and when thoughts words and actions are exempt from controul will you brand him with dependency merely because the Grazier feeds his meat and the Baker kneeds his bread"  "But who is there in the whole world"  said Mr Monckton  "extensive as it is and dissimilar as are it inhabitants that can pretend to assert his thoughts words and actions are exempt from controul even where interest which you so much disdain interferes notthough where that is I confess I cannot tellare we not kept silent where we wish to reprove by the fear of offending and made speak where we wish to be silent by the desire of obliging do we not bow to the scoundrel as low as to the man of honour are we not by mere forms kept standing when tired made give place to those we despise and smiles to those we hate or if we refuse these attentions are we not regarded as savages and shut out of society"  "All these"  answered Belfield  "are  so merely matters of ceremony that the concession can neither cost pain to the proud nor give pleasure to the vain The bow is to the coat the attention is to the rank and the fear of offending ought to extend to all mankind Homage such as this infringes not our sincerity since it is as much a matter of course as the dress that we wear and has as little reason to flatter a man as the shadow which follows him I no more therefore hold him deceitful for not opposing this pantomimical parade than I hold him to be dependent for eating corn he has not sown"  "Where then do you draw the line and what is the boundary beyond which your independence must not step"  "I hold that man"  cried he with energy  "to be independent who treats the Great as the Little and the Little as the Great who neither exults in riches nor blushes in poverty who owes no man a groat and who spends not a shilling he has not earned"  "You will not indeed then have a very numerous acquaintance if this is the description of those with whom you purpose to associate but is it possible you imagine you can live by such notions why the Carthusian in his monastery who is at least removed from temptation is not mortified so severely as a man of spirit living in  the world who would prescribe himself such rules"  "Not merely have I prescribed"  returned Belfield  "I have already put them in practice and far from finding any pennance I never before found happiness I have now adopted though poor the very plan of life I should have elected if rich my pleasure therefore is become my business and my business my pleasure"  "And is this plan"  cried Monckton  "nothing more than turning Knighterrant to the Booksellers"  "'Tis a Knighterrantry"  answered Belfield laughing  "which however ludicrous it may seem to you requires more soul and more brains than any other Our giants may indeed be only windmills but they must be attacked with as much spirit and conquered with as much bravery as any fort or any town in time of war should be demolished and though the siege I must confess may be of less national utility the assailants of the quill have their honour as much at heart as the assailants of the sword"  "I suppose then"  said Monckton archly  "if a man wants a biting lampoon or an handsome panegyric some newspaper scandal or a a sonnet for a lady"  "No no"  interrupted Belfield eagerly  "if you imagine me a hireling scribble  for the purposes of defamation or of flattery you as little know my situation as my character My subjects shall be my own and my satire shall be general I would as much disdain to be personal with an anonymous pen as to attack an unarmed man in the dark with a dagger I had kept concealed"  A reply of rallying incredulity was rising to the lips of Mr Monckton when reading in the looks of Cecilia an entire approbation of this sentiment he checked his desire of ridicule and exclaimed  "spoken like a man of honour and one whose works may profit the world"  "From my earliest youth to the present hour"  continued Belfield  "literature has been the favourite object of my pursuit my recreation in leisure and my hope in employment My propensity to it indeed has been so ungovernable that I may properly call it the source of my several miscarriages throughout life It was the bar to my preferment for it gave me a distaste to other studies it was the cause of my unsteadiness in all my undertakings because to all I preferred it It has sunk me to distress it has involved me in difficulties it has brought me to the brink of ruin by making me neglect the means of living  yet never till now did I discern it might itself be my support"  "I am heartily glad Sir"  said Cecilia  "your various enterprizes and struggles have at length ended in a project which promises you so much satisfaction But you will surely suffer your sister and your mother to partake of it for who is there that your prosperity will make so happy"  "You do them infinite honour madam by taking any interest in their affairs but to own to you the truth what to me appears prosperity will to them wear another aspect They have looked forward to my elevation with expectations the most improbable and thought every thing within my grasp with a simplicity incredible But though their hopes were absurd I am pained by their disappointment and I have not courage to meet their tears which I am sure will not be spared when they see me"  "'Tis from tenderness then"  said Cecilia half smiling  "that you are cruel and from affection to your friends that you make them believe you have forgotten them"  There was a delicacy in this reproach exactly suited to work upon Belfield who feeling it with quickness started up and cried  "I believe I am wrongI will go to them this moment"  Cecilia felt eager to second the generous impulse but Mr Monckton laughing at his impetuosity insisted he should first finish his breakfast  "Your friends"  said Cecilia  "can have no mortification so hard to bear as your voluntary absence and if they see but that you are happy they will soon be reconciled to whatever situation you may chuse"  "Happy"  repeated he with animation  "Oh I am in Paradise I am come from a region in the first rude state of nature to civilization and refinement the life I led at the cottage was the life of a savage no intercourse with society no consolation from books my mind locked up every source dried of intellectual delight and no enjoyment in my power but from sleep and from food Weary of an existence which thus levelled me with a brute I grew ashamed of the approximation and listening to the remonstrance of my understanding I gave up the precipitate plan to pursue one more consonant to reason I came to town hired a room and sent for pen ink and paper what I have written are trifles but the Bookseller has not rejected them I was settled therefore in a moment and comparing my new occupation with that I had just quitted I seemed exalted on the sudden from a mere creature of instinct to  a rational and intelligent being But when first I opened a book after so long an abstinence from all mental nourishmentOh it was rapture no halffamished beggar regaled suddenly with food ever seized on his repast with more hungry avidity"  "Let fortune turn which way it will"  cried Monckton  "you may defy all its malice while possessed of a spirit of enjoyment which nothing can subdue"  "But were you not Sir"  said Cecilia  "as great an enthusiast the other day for your cottage and for labour"  "I was madam but there my philosophy was erroneous in my ardour to fly from meanness and from dependence I I thought in labour and retirement I should find freedom and happiness but I forgot that my body was not seasoned for such work and considered not that a mind which had once been opened by knowledge could ill endure the contraction of dark and perpetual ignorance The approach however of winter brought me acquainted with my mistake It grew cold it grew bleak little guarded against the inclemency of the weather I felt its severity in every limb and missed a thousand indulgencies which in possession I had never valued To rise at break of day chill freezing and comfortless no sun abroad no fire at home  to go out in all weather to work that work rough coarse and laboriousunused to such hardships I found I could not bear them and however unwillingly was compelled to relinquish the attempt"  Breakfast now being over he again arose to take leave  "You are going then Sir"  said Cecilia  "immediately to your friends"  "No madam"  answered he hesitating  "not just this moment tomorrow morning perhapsbut it is now late and I have business for the rest of the day"  "Ah Mr Monckton"  cried Cecilia  "what mischief have you done by occasioning this delay  "This goodness madam"  said Belfield  "my sister can never sufficiently acknowledge But I will own that though just now in a warm moment I felt eager to present myself to her and my mother I rather wish now I am cooler to be saved the pain of telling them in person my situation I mean therefore first to write to them"  "You will not fail then to see them tomorrow"  "CertainlyI think not"  "Nay but certainly you  must  not for I shall call upon them today and assure them they may expect you Can I soften  your task of writing by giving them any message from you"  "Ah madam have a care"  cried he  "this condescension to a poor author may be more dangerous than you have any suspicion and before you have power to help yourself you may see your name prefixed to the Dedication of some trumpery pamphlet"  "I will run"  cried she  "all risks remember therefore you will be responsible for the performance of my promise"  "I will be sure"  answered he  "not to forget what reflects so much honour upon myself"  Cecilia was satisfied by this assent and he then went away  "A strange flighty character"  cried Mr Monckton  "yet of uncommon capacity and full of genius Were he less imaginative wild and eccentric he has abilities for any station and might fix and distinguish himself almost whereever he pleased"  "I knew not"  said Cecilia  "the full worth of steadiness and prudence till I knew this young man for he has every thing else talents the most striking a love of virtue the most elevated and manners the most pleasing yet wanting steadiness and prudence he can neither act with consistency nor prosper with continuance"  "He is well enough"  said Lady Margaret who had heard the whole argument in sullen taciturnity  "he is well enough I say and there comes no good from young women's being so difficult"  Cecilia offended by a speech which implied a rude desire to dispose of her went up stairs to her own room and Mr Monckton always enraged when young men and Cecilia were alluded to in the same sentence retired to his library  She then ordered a chair and went to PortlandStreet to fulfil what she had offered to Belfield and to revive his mother and sister by the pleasure of the promised interview  She found them together and her intelligence being of equal consequence to both she did not now repine at the presence of Mrs Belfield She made her communication with the most cautious attention to their characters softening the ill she had to relate with respect to Belfield's present way of living by endeavouring to awaken affection and joy from the prospect of the approaching meeting She counselled them as much as possible to restrain their chagrin at his misfortunes which he would but construe into reproach of his ill management and she represented that when once he was restored to his family he might almost imperceptibly  be led into some less wild and more profitable scheme of business  When she had told all she thought proper to relate kindly interspersing her account with the best advice and best comfort she could suggest she made an end of her visit for the affliction of Mrs Belfield upon hearing the actual situation of her son was so clamorous and unappeaseable that little wondering at Belfield's want of courage to encounter it and having no opportunity in such a storm to console the soft Henrietta whose tears flowed abundantly that her brother should thus be fallen she only promised before she left town to see her again and beseeching Mrs Belfield to moderate her concern was glad to leave the house where her presence had no power to quiet their distress  She passed the rest of the day in sad reflections upon the meeting she was herself to have the next morning with Mr Delvile She wished ardently to know whether his son was gone abroad and whether Mrs Delvile was recovered whose health in her own letter was mentioned in terms the most melancholy yet neither of these enquiries could she even think of making since reasonably without them apprehensive of some reproach  CHAP IV A WRANGLING  MR Monckton the next day as soon breakfast was over went out to avoid showing even to Cecilia the anxiety he felt concerning the regulation of her fortune and arrangement of her affairs He strongly however advised her not to mention her large debt which though contracted in the innocence of the purest benevolence would incur nothing but reproof and disapprobation from all who only heard of it when they heard of its inutility  At eleven o'clock though an hour before the time appointed while Cecilia was sitting in Lady Margaret's dressingroom  "with sad civility and an aching head"  she was summoned to Mr Briggs in the parlour  He immediately began reproaching her with having eloped from him in the summer and with the various expences she had caused him from useless purchases and spoilt provisions He then complained of Mr Delvile whom he charged with defrauding him of his dues but observing in the midst  of his railing her dejection of countenance he suddenly broke off and looking at her with some concern said  "what's the matter Ducky a'n't well look as if you could not help it"  "O yes"  cried Cecilia  "I thank you Sir I am very well"  "What do look so blank for then"  said he  "hay what are fretting forcrossed in lovelost your sweetheart"  "No no no"  cried she with quickness  "Never mind my chick never mind"  said he pinching her cheek with resumed good humour  "more to be had if one won't snap another will put me in a passion by going off from me with that old grandee or would have got one long ago Hate that old Don used me very ill wish I could trounce him Thinks more of a fusty old parchment than the price of stocks Fit for nothing but to be stuck upon an old monument for a Death's head"  He then told her that her accounts were all made out and he was ready at any time to produce them he approved much of her finishing wholly with the  old Don  who had been a mere cypher in the executorship but he advised her not to think of taking her money into her own hands as he was willing to keep the charge of it himself till she was married  Cecilia thanking him for the offer said she meant now to make her acknowledgments for all the trouble he had already taken but by no means purposed to give him any more  He debated the matter with her warmly told her she had no chance to save herself from knaves and cheats but by trusting to nobody but himself and informing her what interest he had already made of her money enquired how she would set about getting more  Cecilia though prejudiced against him by Mr Monckton knew not how to combat his arguments yet conscious that scarce any part of the money to which he alluded was in fact her own she could not yield to them He was however so stubborn and so difficult to deal with that she at length let him talk without troubling herself to answer and privately determined to beg Mr Monckton would fight her battle  She was not therefore displeased by his interruption though very much surprised by the sight of his person when in the midst of Mr Briggs's oratory Mr Hobson entered the parlour  "I ask pardon ma'am"  cried he  "if I intrude but I made free to call upon the account of two ladies that are acquaintances  of yours that are quite as one may say at their wit's ends"  "What is the matter with them Sir"  "Why ma'am no great matter but mothers are soon frightened and when once they are upon the fret one may as well talk to the boards they know no more of reasoning and arguing than they do of a shop ledger however my maxim is this every body in their way one has no more right to expect courageousness from a lady in them cases than one has from a child in arms for what I say is they have not the proper use of their heads which makes it very excusable"  "But what has occasioned any alarm nothing I hope is the matter with Miss Belfield"  "No ma'am thank God the young lady enjoys her health very well but she is taking on just in the same way as her mamma as what can be more natural Example ma'am is apt to be catching and one lady's crying makes another think she must do the same for a little thing serves for a lady's tears being they can cry at any time but a man is quite of another nature let him but have a good conscience and be clear of the world and I'll engage he'll not wash his face without soap that's what I say"  "Will will"  cried Mr Briggs  "do it myself never use soap nothing but waste take a little sand does as well"  "Let every man have his own proposal"  answered Hobson  "for my part I take every morning a large bowl of water and souse my whole head in it and then when I've rubbed it dry on goes my wig and I am quite fresh and agreeable and then I take a walk in Tottenham Court Road as far as the Tabernacle or thereabouts and snuff in a little fresh country air and then I come back with a good wholesome appetite and in a fine breathing heat asking the young lady's pardon and I enjoy my pot of fresh tea and my round of hot toast and butter with as good a relish as if I was a Prince"  "Pot of fresh tea"  cried Briggs  "bring a man to ruin toast and butter never suffer it in my house Breakfast on watergruel sooner done fills one up in a second Give it my servants can't eat much of it bob 'em there"  nodding significantly  "Watergruel"  exclaimed Mr Hobson  "why I could not get it down if I might have the world for it it would make me quite sick asking the young lady's pardon by reason I should always think I was preparing for the smallpox My notion is quite of another nature the first thing I  do is to have a good fire for what I say is this if a man is cold in his fingers it's odds if ever he gets warm in his purse ha ha  warm  you take me Sir I mean a pun Though I ought to ask pardon for I suppose the young lady don't know what I am a saying"  "I should indeed be better pleased Sir"  said Cecilia  "to hear what you have to say about Miss Belfield"  "Why ma'am the thing is this we have been expecting the young 'Squire as I call him all the morning and he has never come so Mrs Belfield not knowing where to send after him was of opinion he might be here knowing your kindness to him and that"  "You make the enquiry at the wrong place Sir"  said Cecilia much provoked by the implication it conveyed  "if Mr Belfield is in this house you must seek him with Mr Monckton"  "You take no offence I hope ma'am at my just asking of the question for Mrs Belfield crying and being in that dilemma I thought I could do no less than oblige her by coming to see if the young gentleman was here"  "What's this what's this"  cried Mr Briggs eagerly  "who are talking of hay  who do mean is this the sweetheart eh Duck"  "No no Sir"  cried Cecilia  "No tricks won't be bit who is it will know tell me I say"  "  I'll  tell you Sir"  cried Mr Hobson  "it's a very handsome young gentleman with as fine a person and as genteel a way of behaviour and withal as pretty a manner of dressing himself and that as any lady need desire He has no great head for business as I am told but the ladies don't stand much upon that topic being they know nothing of it themselves"  "Has got the ready"  cried Mr Briggs impatiently  "can cast an account that's the point can come down handsomely eh"  "Why as to that Sir I'm not bound to speak to a gentleman's private affairs What's my own is my own and what is another person's is another person's that's my way of arguing and that's what I call talking to the purpose"  "Dare say he's a rogue don't have him chick Bet a wager i'n't worth two shillings and that will go for powder and pomatum hate a plaistered pate commonly a numscull love a good bob jerom"  "Why this is talking quite wide of the mark"  said Mr Hobson  "to suppose a  young lady of fortunes would marry a man with a bobjerom What I say is let every body follow their nature that's the way to be comfortable and then if they pay every one his own who's a right to call 'em to account whether they wear a bobjerom or a pigtail down to the calves of their legs"  "Ay ay"  cried Briggs sneeringly  "or whether they stuff their gullets with hot rounds of toast and butter"  "And what if they do Sir"  returned Hobson a little angrily  "when a man's got above the world where's the harm of living a little genteel as to a round of toast and butter and a few oysters fresh opened by way of a damper before dinner no man need be ashamed of them provided he pays as he goes and as to living upon watergruel and scrubbing one's flesh with sand one might as well be a galleyslave at once You don't understand life Sir I see that"  "Do do"  cried Briggs speaking through his shut teeth  "you're out there oysterscome to ruin tell you bring you to jail"  "To jail Sir"  exclaimed Hobson  "this is talking quite ungenteel let every man be civil that's what  I  say for that's the way to make every thing agreeable but as to telling a man he'll go to jail and that it's tantamount to affronting him"  A rap at the streetdoor gave now a new relief to Cecilia who began to grow very apprehensive lest the delight of spending money thus warmly contested with that of hoarding it should give rise to a quarrel which between two such sturdy champions for their own opinions might lead to a conclusion rather more rough and violent than she desired to witness but when the parlourdoor opened instead of Mr Delvile whom she now fully expected Mr Albany made his entrance  This was rather distressing as her real business with her guardians made it proper her conference with them should be undisturbed and Albany was not a man with whom a hint that she was engaged could be risked but she had made no preparation to guard against interruption as her little acquaintance in London had prevented her expecting any visitors  He advanced with a solemn air to Cecilia and looking as if hardly determined whether to speak with severity or gentleness said  "once more I come to prove thy sincerity now wilt thou go with me where sorrow calls thee sorrow thy charity can mitigate"  "I am very much concerned"  she answered  "but indeed at present it is utterly impossible"  "Again"  cried he with a look at once stern and disappointed  "again thou failest me what wanton trifling why shouldst thou thus elate a wornout mind only to make it feel its lingering credulity or why teaching me to think I had found an angel so unkindly undeceive me"  "Indeed"  said Cecilia much affected by this reproof  "if you knew how heavy a loss I had personally suffered"  "I do know it"  cried he  "and I grieved for thee when I heard it Thou hast lost a faithful old friend a loss which with every setting sun thou may'st mourn for the rising sun will never repair it but was that a reason for shunning the duties of humanity was the sight of death a motive for neglecting the claims of benevolence ought it not rather to have hastened your fulfilling them and should not your own suffering experience of the brevity of life have taught you the vanity of all things but preparing for its end  "Perhaps so but my grief at that time made me think only of myself  "And of what else dost thou think now"  "Most probably of the same person still"  said she half smiling  "but yet believe me I have real business to transact"  "Frivolous unmeaning everready excuses what business is so important as the relief of a fellowcreature"  "I shall not I hope there"  answered she with alacrity  "be backward but at least for this morning I must beg to make you my Almoner"  She then took out her purse  Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson whose quarrel had been suspended by the appearance of a third person and who had stood during this short dialogue in silent amazement having first lost their anger in their mutual consternation now lost their consternation in their mutual displeasure Mr Hobson felt offended to hear business spoken of slightly and Mr Briggs felt enraged at the sight of Cecilia's ready purse Neither of them however knew which way to interfere the stern gravity of Albany joined to a language too lofty for their comprehension intimidating them both They took however the relief of communing with one another and Mr Hobson said in a whisper  "This you must know is I am told a very particular old gentleman quite what I call a genius He comes often to my house to see my lodger Miss Henny Belfield though I never happened to light upon him myself except once in the passage but what I hear of him is this he makes a practice as one may say of going about into people's houses to do nothing but find fault"  "Shan't get into mine"  returned Briggs  "promise him that don't half like him be bound he's an old sharper"  Cecilia mean time enquired what he desired to have  Half a guinea he answered  "Will that do"  "For those who have nothing"  said he  "it is much Hereafter you may assist them again Go but and see their distresses and you will wish to give them every thing"  Mr Briggs now when actually between her fingers he saw the half guinea could contain no longer he twitched the sleeve of her gown and pinching her arm with a look of painful eagerness said in a whisper  "Don't give it don't let him have it chouse him chouse him nothing but an old bite"  "Pardon me Sir"  said Cecilia in a low voice  "his character is very well known to me"  And then disengaging her arm from him she presented her little offering  At this sight Mr Briggs was almost outrageous and losing in his wrath all fear of the stranger he burst forth with fury into the following outcries  "Be ruined see it plainly be fleeced be stript be robbed won't have a gown to your back  won't have a shoe to your foot won't have a rag in the world be a beggar in the street come to the parish rot in a jailhalf a guinea at a timeenough to break the Great Mogul  "Inhuman spirit of selfish parsimony"  exclaimed Albany  "repinest thou at this loan given from thousands to those who have worse than nothing who pay to day in hunger for bread they borrowed yesterday from pity who to save themselves from the deadly pangs of famine solicit but what the rich know not when they possess and miss not when they give"  "Anan"  cried Briggs recovering his temper from the perplexity of his understanding at a discourse to which his ears were wholly unaccustomed  "what d'ye say"  "If to thyself distress may cry in vain"  continued Albany  "if thy own heart resists the suppliant's prayer callous to entreaty and hardened in the world suffer at least a creature yet untainted who melts at sorrow and who glows with charity to pay from her vast wealth a generous tax of thankfulness that fate has not reversed her doom and those whom she relieves relieve not her"  "Anan"  was again all the wondering Mr Briggs could say  "Pray ma'am"  said Mr Hobson to Cecilia  "if its no offence was the Gentleman ever a player"  "I fancy not indeed"  "I ask pardon then ma'am I mean no harm but my notion was the gentleman might be speaking something by heart"  "Is it but on the stage humanity exists"  cried Albany indignantly  "Oh thither hasten then ye monopolizers of plenty ye selfish unfeeling engrossers of wealth which ye dissipate without enjoying and of abundance which ye waste while ye refuse to distribute thither thither haste if there humanity exists"  "As to engrossing"  said Mr Hobson happy to hear at last a word with which he was familiar  "it's what I never approved myself My maxim is this if a man makes a fair penny without any underhand dealings why he has as much a title to enjoy his pleasure as the Chief Justice or the Lord Chancellor and its odds but he's as happy as a greater man Though what I hold to be best of all is a clear conscience with a neat income of or a year That's my notion and I don't think it's a bad one"  "Weak policy of shortsighted ignorance"  cried Albany  "to wish for what if used brings care and if neglected remorse  have you not now beyond what nature craves why then still sigh for more"  "Why"  cried Mr Briggs who by dint of deep attention began now better to comprehend him  "why to buy in to be sure ever hear of stocks eh know any thing of money"  "Still to make more and more"  cried Albany  "and wherefore to spend in vice and idleness or hoard in chearless misery not to give succour to the wretched not to support the falling all is for self however little wanted all goes to added stores or added luxury no fellowcreature served nor even one beggar relieved  "Glad of it"  cried Briggs  "glad of it would not have 'em relieved don't like 'em hate a beggar ought to be all whipt live upon spunging"  "Why as to a beggar I must needs say"  cried Mr Hobson  "I am by no means an approver of that mode of proceeding being I take 'em all for cheats for what I say is this what a man earns he earns and it's no man's business to enquire what he spends for a freeborn Englishman is his own master by the nature of the law and as to his being a subject why a Duke is no more nor a Judge nor the Lord High Chancellor and the like of those  which makes it tantamount to nothing being he is answerable to nobody by the right of Magna Charta except in cases of treason felony and that But as to a beggar it's quite another thing he comes and asks me for money but what has he to shew for it what does he bring me in exchange why a long story that he i'n't worth a penny what's that to me nothing at all Let every man have his own that's my way of arguing"  "Ungentle mortals"  cried Albany  "in wealth exulting even in inhumanity think you these wretched outcasts have less sensibility than yourselves think you in cold and hunger they lose those feelings which even in voluptuous prosperity from time to time disturb you you say they are all cheats 'tis but the niggard cant of avarice to lure away remorse from obduracy Think you the naked wanderer begs from choice give him your wealth and try"  "Give him a whip"  cried Briggs sha'n't have a souse send him to Bridewell nothing but a pauper hate 'em hate 'em all full of tricks break their own legs put out their arms cut off their fingers snap their own anclesall for what to get at the chink to chouse us of cash  ought to be well flogged have 'em all sent to the Thames worse than the Convicts  "Poor subterfuge of callous cruelty you cheat yourselves to shun the fraud of others and yet how better do you use the wealth so guarded what nobler purpose can it answer to you than even a chance to snatch some wretch from sinking think less how  much  ye save and more for  what  and then consider how thy full coffers may hereafter make reparation for the empty catalogue of thy virtues"  "Anan"  said Mr Briggs again lost in perplexity and wonder  "Oh yet"  continued Albany turning towards Cecilia  "preach not here the hardness which ye practice rather amend yourselves than corrupt her and give with liberality what ye ought to receive with gratitude"  "This is not my doctrine  "cried Hobson  "I am not a near man neither but as to giving at that rate it's quite out of character I have as good a right to my own savings as to my own gettings and what I say is this who'll give to  me  let me see that and it's quite another thing and begin who will I'll be bound to go on with him pound for pound or pence for pence But as to giving to them beggars it's what I don't approve I pay the poor's  rate and that's what I call charity enough for any man But for the matter of living well and spending one's money handsomely and having one's comforts about one why it's a thing of another nature and I can say this for myself and that is I never grudged myself any thing in my life I always made myself agreeable and lived on the best That's my way"  "Bad way too"  cried Briggs  "never get on with it never see beyond your nose won't be worth a plum while your head wags"  then taking Cecilia apart  "hark'ee my duck"  he added pointing to Albany  "who is that Mr Bounce eh what is he"  "I have known him but a short time Sir but I think of him very highly"  "Is he a  good  man that's the point is he a  good  man"  "Indeed he appears to me uncommonly benevolent and charitable"  "But that i'n't the thing is he  warm  that's the point is he  warm  "  "If you mean  passionate  "  said Cecilia  "I believe the energy of his manner is merely to enforce what he says"  "Don't take me don'ttake me"  cried he impatiently  "can come down with the ready that's the matter can chink the little gold boys eh"  "Why I rather fear not by his appearance but I know nothing of his affairs"  "What does come for eh come a courting"  "Mercy on me no"  "What for then only a spunging"  "No indeed He seems to have no wish but to assist and plead for others"  "All fudge think he i'n't touched ay ay nothing but a trick only to get at the chink see he's as poor as a rat talks of nothing but giving money a bad sign if he'd got any would not do it Wanted to make us come down warrant thought to bam us all out there a'n't so soon gulled"  A knock at the streetdoor gave now a new interruption and Mr Delvile at length appeared  Cecilia whom his sight could not fail to disconcert felt doubly distressed by the unnecessary presence of Albany and Hobson she regretted the absence of Mr Monckton who could easily have taken them away for though without scruple she could herself have acquainted Mr Hobson she had business she dreaded offending Albany whose esteem she was ambitious of obtaining  Mr Delvile entered the room with an air stately and erect he took off his hat but  deigned not to make the smallest inclination of his head nor offered any excuse to Mr Briggs for being past the hour of his appointment but having advanced a few paces without looking either to the right or left said  "as I have never acted my coming may not perhaps be essential but as my name is in the Dean's Will and I have once or twice met the other executors mentioned in it I think it a duty I owe to my own heirs to prevent any possible future enquiry or trouble to them"  This speech was directly addressed to no one though meant to be attended to by every one and seemed proudly uttered as a mere apology to himself for not having declined the meeting  Cecilia though she recovered from her confusion by the help of her aversion to this selfsufficiency made not any answer Albany retired to a corner of the room Mr Hobson began to believe it was time for him to depart and Mr Briggs thinking only of the quarrel in which he had separated with Mr Delvile in the summer stood swelling with venom which he longed for an opportunity to spit out  Mr Delvile who regarded this silence as the effect of his aweinspiring presence became rather more complacent but casting his eyes round the room and perceiving  the two strangers he was visibly surprised and looking at Cecilia for some explanation seemed to stand suspended from the purpose of his visit till he heard one  Cecilia earnet to have the business concluded turned to Mr Briggs and said  "Sir here is pen and ink  to write or am I or what is to be done"  "No no"  said he with a sneer  "give it t'other all in our turn don't come before his Grace the Right Honourable Mr Vampus"  "Before whom Sir"  said Mr Delvile reddening  "Before my Lord Don Pedigree"  answered Briggs with a spiteful grin  "know him eh ever hear of such a person"  Mr Delvile coloured still deeper but turning contemptuously from him disdained making any reply  Mr Briggs who now regarded him as a defeated man said exultingly to Mr Hobson  "what do stand here forhayfall o' your marrowbones don't see 'Squire High and Mighty"  "As to falling on my marrowbones"  answered Mr Hobson  "it's what I shall do to no man except he was the King himself or the like of that and going to make me Chancellor of the Exchequer or Commissioner of Excise Not that I mean  the gentleman any offence but a man's a man and for one man to worship another is quite out of law"  "Must must"  cried Briggs  "tell all his old granddads else keeps 'em in a roll locks 'em in a closet says his prayers to 'em can't live without 'em likes 'em better than cashwish had 'em here pop 'em all in the sink"  "If your intention Sir"  cried Mr Delvile fiercely  "is only to insult me I am prepared for what measures I shall take I declined seeing you in my own house that I might not be under the same restraint as when it was my unfortunate lot to meet you last"  "Who cares"  cried Briggs with an air of defiance  "what can do eh poke me into a family vault bind me o' top of an old monument tie me to a stinking carcase make a corpse of me and call it one of your famous cousins"  "For heaven's sake Mr Briggs"  interrupted Cecilia who saw that Mr Delvile trembling with passion scarce refrained lifting up his stick  "be appeased and let us finish our business"  "Albany now hearing in Cecilia's voice the alarm with which she was seized came forward and exclaimed  "whence this unmeaning dissention to what purpose this  irritating abuse Oh vain and foolish live ye so happily last ye so long that time and peace may thus be trifled with"  "There there"  cried Briggs holding up his finger at Mr Delvile  "have it now got old Mr Bounce upon you give you enough of it promise you that"  "Restrain"  continued Albany  "this idle wrath and if ye have ardent passions employ them to nobler uses let them stimulate acts of virtue let them animate deeds of beneficence Oh waste not spirits that may urge you to good lead you to honour warm you to charity in poor and angry words in unfriendly unmanly debate"  Mr Delvile who from the approach of Albany had given him his whole attention was struck with astonishment at this address and almost petrified with wonder at his language and exhortations  "Why I must own"  said Mr Hobson  "as to this matter I am much of the same mind myself for quarreling's a thing I don't uphold being it advances one no way for what I say is this if a man gets the better he's only where he was before and if he gets worsted why it's odds but the laugh's against him so if I may make bold to give my verdict I would have one of these gentlemen take the other by the  hand and so put an end to bad words That's my maxim and that's what I call being agreeable"  "Mr Delvile at the words  one of these gentlemen take the other by the hand  looked scornfully upon Mr Hobson with a frown that expressed his highest indignation at being thus familiarly coupled with Mr Briggs And then turning from him to Cecilia haughtily said  "Are these two persons"  pointing towards Albany and Hobson  "waiting here to be witnesses to any transaction"  "No Sir no"  cried Hobson  "I don't mean to intrude I am going directly So you can give me no insight ma'am"  addressing Cecilia  "as to where I might light upon Mr Belfield"  "Me no"  cried she much provoked by observing that Mr Delvile suddenly looked at her  "Well ma'am well I mean no harm only I hold it that the right way to hear of a young gentleman is to ask for him of a young lady that's my maxim Come Sir"  to Mr Briggs  "you and I had like to have fallen out but what I say is this let no man bear malice that's my way so I hope we part without ill blood"  "Ay ay"  said Mr Briggs giving him a nod  "Well then"  added Hobson  "I hope the goodwill may go round and that not only you and I but these two good old gentlemen will also lend a hand"  Mr Delvile now was at a loss which way to turn for very rage but after looking at every one with a face flaming with ire he said to Cecilia  "If you have collected together these persons for the purpose of affronting me I must beg you to remember I am not one to be affronted with impunity"  Cecilia half frightened was beginning an answer that disclaimed any such intention when Albany with the most indignant energy called out  "Oh pride of heart with littleness of soul check this vile arrogance too vain for man and spare to others some part of that lenity thou nourishest for thyself or justly bestow on thyself that contempt thou nourishest for others"  And with these words he sternly left the house  The thunderstruck Mr Delvile began now to fancy that all the demons of torment were designedly let loose upon him and his surprise and resentment operated so powerfully that it was only in broken sentences he could express either  "Very extraordinarya new method of conduct  liberties to which I am not much usedimpertinences I shall not hastily forgettreatment that would scarce be pardonable to a person wholly unknown"  "Why indeed Sir"  said Hobson  "I can't but say it was rather a cut up but the old gentleman is what one may call a genius which makes it a little excusable for he does things all his own way and I am told it's the same thing who he speaks to so he can but find fault and that"  "Sir"  interrupted the still more highly offended Mr Delvile  "what  you  may be told is extremely immaterial to  me  and I must take the liberty to hint to you a conversation of this easy kind is not what I am much in practice in hearing"  "Sir I ask pardon"  said Hobson  "I meant nothing but what was agreeable however I have done and I wish you good day Your humble servant ma'am and I hope Sir"  to Mr Briggs  "you won't begin bad words again"  "No no"  said Briggs  "ready to make up all at end only don't much like  Spa    that's all"  winking significantly  "not  over fond of a  skeleton  "  Mr Hobson now retired and Mr Delville and Mr Briggs being both  and  in haste to have done settled  five minutes all for which they    after passing more than an hour in agreeing what that was  Mr Briggs then saying he had an engagement upon business declined settling his own accounts till another time but promised to see Cecilia again soon and added  "be sure take care of that old Mr Bounce cracked in the noddle see that with half an eye better not trust him break out some day do you a mischief"  He then went away but while the parlourdoor was still open to the no little surprise of Cecilia the servant announced Mr Belfield He hardly entered the room and his countenance spoke haste and eagerness  "I have this moment madam"  he said  "been informed a complaint has been lodged against me here and I could not rest till I had the honour of assuring you that though I have been rather dilatory I have not neglected my appointment nor has the condescension of your interference been thrown away"  He then bowed shut the door and ran off Cecilia though happy to understand by this speech that he was actually restored to his family was sorry at these repeated intrusions in the presence of Mr Delvile who was now the only one that remained  She expected every instant that he would ring for his chair which he kept in waiting  but after a pause of some continaunce to her equal surprise and disturbance he made the following speech  "As it is probable I am now for the last time alone with you ma'am and as it is certain we shall meet no more upon business I cannot in justice to my own character and to the respect I retain for the memory of the Dean your uncle take a final leave of the office with which he was pleased to invest me without first fulfilling my own ideas of the duty it requires from me by giving you some counsel relating to your future establishment"  This was not a preface much to enliven Cecilia it prepared her for such speeches as she was least willing to hear and gave to her the mixt and painful sensation of spirits depressed with pride alarmed  "My numerous engagements"  he continued  "and the appropriation of my time already settled to their various claims must make me brief in what I have to represent and somewhat perhaps abrupt in coming to the purpose But that you will excuse"  Cecilia disdained to humour this arrogance by any compliments or concessions she was silent therefore and when they were both seated he went on  "You are now at a time of life when it  is natural for young women to wisn for some connection and the largeness of your fortune will remove from you such difficulties as prove bars to the pretensions in this expensive age of those who possess not such advantages It would have been some pleasure to me while I yet considered you as my Ward to have seen you properly disposed of but as that time is past I can only give you some general advice which you may follow or neglect as you think fit By giving it I shall satisfy myself for the rest I am not responsible"  He paused but Cecilia felt less and less inclination to make use of the opportunity by speaking in her turn  "Yet though as I just now hinted young women of large fortunes may have little trouble in finding themselves establishments they ought not therefore to trifle when proper ones are in their power nor to suppose themselves equal to any they may chance to desire"  Cecilia coloured high at this pointed reprehension but feeling her disgust every moment encrease determined to sustain herself with dignity and at least not suffer him to perceive the triumph of his ostentation and rudeness  "The proposals"  he continued  "of the Earl of Ernolf had always my approbation  it was certainly an illjudged thing to neglect such an opportunity of being honourably settled The clause of the name was to  him  immaterial since his own name half a century ago was unheard of and since he is himself only known by his title He is still however I have authority to acquaint you perfectly well disposed to renew his application to you"  "I am sorry Sir"  said Cecilia coldly  "to hear it"  "You have perhaps some other better offer in view"  "No Sir"  cried she with spirit  "nor even in desire"  "Am I then to infer that some inferior offer has more chance of your approbation"  "There is no reason Sir to infer any thing I am content with my actual situation and have at present neither prospect nor intention of changing it"  "I perceive but without surprise your unwillingness to discuss the subject nor do I mean to press it I shall merely offer to your consideration one caution and then relieve you from my presence Young women of ample fortunes who are early independent are sometimes apt to presume they may do every thing with impunity but they are mistaken they are as liable to  censure as those who are wholly unprovided for"  "I hope Sir"  said Cecilia staring  "this at least is a caution rather drawn from my situation than my behaviour"  "I mean not ma'am narrowly to go into or investigate the subject what I have said you may make your own use of I have only to observe further that when young women at your time of life are at all negligent of so nice a thing as reputation they commonly live to repent it"  He then arose to go but Cecilia not more offended than amazed said  "I must beg Sir you will explain yourself"  "Certainly this matter"  he answered  "must be immaterial to  me  yet as I have once been your guardian by the nomination of the Dean your uncle I cannot forbear making an effort towards preventing any indiscretion and frequent visits to a young man"  "Good God Sir"  interrupted Cecilia  "what is it you mean"  "It can certainly as I said before be nothing to  me  though I should be glad to see you in better hands but I cannot suppose you have been led to take such steps without some serious plan and I would advise you without loss of time to think better of what you are about"  "Should I think Sir to eternity"  cried Cecilia  "I could never conjecture what you mean"  "You may not chuse"  said he proudly  "to understand me but I have done If it had been in my power to have interfered in your service with my Lord Derford notwithstanding my reluctance to being involved in any fresh employment I should have made a point of not refusing it but this young man is nobodya very imprudent connection"  "What young man Sir"  "Nay  I  know nothing of him it is by no means likely I should but as I had already been informed of your attention to him the corroborating incidents of my servant's following you to his house his friend's seeking him at yours and his own waiting upon you this morning were not well calculated to make me withdraw my credence to it"  "Is it then Mr Belfield Sir concerning whom you draw these inferences from circumstances the most accidental and unmeaning"  "It is by no means my practice"  cried he haughtily and with evident marks of high displeasure at this speech  "to believe any thing lightly or without even unquestionable authority what once therefore I  have credited I do not often find erro+neous Mistake not however what I have said into supposing I have any objection to your marrying on the contrary it had been for the honour of my family had you been married a year ago I should not then have suffered the degradation of seeing a son of the first expectations in the kingdom upon the point of renouncing his birth nor a woman of the first distinction ruined in her health and broken for ever in her constitution"  The emotions of Cecilia at this speech were too powerful for concealment her colour varied now reddening with indignation now turning pale with apprehension she arose she trembled and sat down she arose again but not knowing what to say or what to do again sat down  Mr Delvile then making a stiff bow wished her good morning  "Go not so Sir"  cried she in faltering accents  "let me at least convince you of the mistake with regard to Mr Belfield"  "My mistakes ma'am"  said he with a contemptuous smile  "are perhaps not easily convicted and I may possibly labour under others that would give you no less trouble it may therefore be better to avoid any further disquisition"  "No not better"  answered she again  recovering her courage from this fresh provocation  "I fear no disquisition on the contrary it is my interest to solicit one"  "This intrepidity in a young woman"  said he ironically  "is certainly very commendable and doubtless as you are your own mistress your having run out great part of your fortune is nothing beyond what you have a right to do"  "Me"  cried Cecilia astonished  "run out great part of my fortune"  "Perhaps that is another  mistake  I have not often been so unfortunate and you are not then in debt"  "In debt Sir"  "Nay I have no intention to enquire into your affairs Good morning to you ma'am"  "I beg I entreat Sir that you will stopmake me at least understand what you mean whether you deign to hear my justification or not"  "O I am mistaken it seems misinformed deceived and you have neither spent more than you have received nor taken up money of Jews your minority has been clear of debts and your fortune now you are of age will be free from incombrances"  Cecilia who now began to understand  him eagerly answered  "do you mean Sir the money which I took up last spring"  "O no by no means I conceive the whole to be a  mistake  "  And he went to the door  "Hear me but a moment Sir"  cried she hastily following him  "since you know of that transaction do not refuse to listen to its occasion I took up the money for Mr Harrel it was all and solely for him"  "For Mr Harrel was it"  said he with an air of supercilious incredulity  "that was rather an unlucky step Your servant ma'am"  And he opened the door  "You will not hear me then you will not credit me"  cried she in the cruellest agitation  "Some other time ma'am at present my avocations are too numerous to permit me"  And again stiffly bowing he called to his servants who were waiting in the hall and put himself into his chair  CHAP V A SUSPICION  CECILIA was now left in a state of perturbation that was hardly to be indured The contempt with which she had been treated during the whole visit was nothing short of insult but the accusations with which it was concluded did not more irritate than astonish her  That some strange prejudice had been taken against her even more than belonged to her connection with young Delvile the message brought her by Dr Lyster had given her reason to suppose what that prejudice was she now knew though how excited she was still ignorant but she found Mr Delvile had been informed she had taken up money of a Jew without having heard it was for Mr Harrel and that he had been acquainted with her visits in PortlandStreet without seeming to know Mr Belfield had a sister Two charges such as these so serious in their nature and so distructive of her character filled her with horror and consternation and even somewhat  served to palliate his illiberal and injurious behaviour  But how reports thus false and thus disgraceful should be raised and by what dark work of slander and malignity they had been spread remained a doubt inexplicable They could not she was certain be the mere rumour of chance since in both the assertions there was some foundation of truth however cruelly perverted or basely overcharged  This led her to consider how few people there were not only who had interest but who had power to propagate such calumnies even her acquaintance with the Belfield's she remembered not ever mentioning for she knew none of their friends and none of her own knew them How then should it be circulated that she  "visited often at the house"  how ever be invented that it was from her  "attention to the young man"  Henrietta she was sure was too good and too innocent to be guilty of such perfidy and the young man himself had always shewn a modesty and propriety that manifested his total freedom from the vanity of such a suspicion and an elevation of sentiment that would have taught him to scorn the boast even if he believed the partiality  The mother however had neither been  so modest nor so rational she had openly avowed her opinion that Cecilia was in love with her son and as that son by never offering himself had never been refused her opinion had received no check of sufficient force for a mind so gross and literal to change it  This part therefore of the charge she gave to Mrs Belfield whose officious and loquacious forwardness she concluded had induced her to narrate her suspicions till step by step they had reached Mr Delvile  But though able by the probability of this conjecture to account for the report concerning Belfield the whole affair of the debt remained a difficulty not to be solved Mr Harrel his wife Mr Arnott the Jew and Mr Monckton were the only persons to whom the transaction was known and though from five a secret in the course of so many months might easily be supposed likely to transpire those five were so particularly bound to silence not only for her interest but their own that it was not unreasonable to believe it as safe among them all as if solely consigned to one For herself she had revealed it to no creature but Mr Monckton not even to Delvile though upon her consenting to marry him he had an undoubted right to be acquainted with the true state of her affairs but such  had been the hurry distress confusion and irresolution of her mind at that period that this whole circumstance had been driven from it entirely and she had since frequently blamed herself for such want of recollection Mr Harrel for a thousand reasons she was certain had never named it and had the communication come from his widow or from Mr Arnott the motives would have been related as well as the debt and she had been spared the reproach of contracting it for purposes of her own extravagance The Jew indeed was to her under no obligation of secrecy but he had an obligation far more bindinghe was tied to himself  A suspicion now arose in her mind which made it thrill with horror  good God  she exclaimed  can Mr Monckton"  She stopt even to herselfshe checked the ideashe drove it hastily from hershe was certain it was false and cruelshe hated herself for having started it  "No cried she he is my friend the confirmed friend of many years my wellwisher from childhood my zealous counsellor and assistant almost from my birth to this hoursuch perfidy from him would not even be human"  Yet still her perplexity was undiminished the affair was undoubtedly known and it  only could be known by the treachery of some one entrusted with it and however earnestly her generosity combated her rising suspicions she could not wholly quell them and Mr Monckton's strange aversion to the Delviles his earnestness to break off her connexion with them occurred to her remembrance and haunted her perforce with surmises to his disadvantage  That gentleman when he came home found her in this comfortless and fluctuating state endeavouring to form conjectures upon what had happened yet unable to succeed but by suggestions which one moment excited her abhorrence of him and the next of herself  He enquired with his usual appearance of easy friendliness into what had passed with her two guardians and how she had settled her affairs She answered without hesitation all his questions but her manner was cold and reserved though her communication was frank  This was not unheeded by Mr Monckton who after a short time begged to know if any thing had disturbed her  Cecilia ashamed of her doubts though unable to get rid of them then endeavoured to brighten up and changed the subject to the difficulties she had had to encounter from the obstinacy of Mr Briggs  Mr Monckton for a while humoured this evasion but when by her own exertion her solemnity began to wear off he repeated his interrogatory and would not be satisfied without an answer  Cecilia earnest that surmises so injurious should be removed then honestly but without comments related the scene which had just past between Mr Delvile and herself  No comments were however wanting to explain to Mr Monckton the change of her behaviour  "I see"  he cried hastily  "what you cannot but suspect and I will go myself to Mr Delvile and insist upon his clearing me"  Cecilia shocked to have thus betrayed what was passing within her assured him his vindication required not such a step and begged he would counsel her how to discover this treachery without drawing from her concern at it a conclusion so offensive to himself  He was evidently however and greatly disturbed he declared his own wonder equal to her's how the affair had been betrayed expressed the warmest indignation at the malevolent insinuations against her conduct and lamented with mingled acrimony and grief that there should exist even  the possibility of casting the odium of such villainy upon himself  Cecilia distressed perplexed and ashamed at once again endeavoured to appease him and though a lurking doubt obstinately clung to her understanding the purity of her own principles and the softness of her heart pleaded strongly for his innocence and urged her to detest her suspicion though to conquer it they were unequal  "It is true"  said he with an air ingenuous though mortified  "I dislike the Delvile's and have always disliked them they appear to me a jealous vindictive and insolent race and I should have thought I betrayed the faithful regard I professed for you had I concealed my opinion when I saw you in danger of forming an alliance with them I spoke to you therefore with honest zeal thoughtless of any enmity I might draw upon myself but though it was an interference from which I hoped by preventing the connection to contribute to your happiness it was not with a design to stop it at the expence of your charactera design black horrible and diabolical a design which must be formed by a Daemon but which even a Daemon could never I think execute"  The candour of this speech in which his aversion to the Delvile's was openly acknowledged  and rationally justified somewhat quieted the suspicions of Cecilia which far more anxiously sought to be confuted than confirmed she began therefore to conclude that some accident inexplicable as unfortunate had occasioned the partial discovery to Mr Delvile by which her own goodness proved the source of her defamation and though something still hung upon her mind that destroyed that firm confidence she had hitherto felt in the friendship of Mr Monckton she held it utterly unjust to condemn him without proof which she was not more unable to procure than to satisfy herself with any reason why so perfidiously he should calumniate her  Comfortless however and tormented with conjectures equally vague and afflicting she could only clear him to be lost in perplexity she could only accuse him to be penetrated with horror She endeavoured to suspend her judgment till time should develop the mystery and only for the present sought to finish her business and leave London  She renewed therefore again the subject of Mr Briggs and told him how vain had been her effort to settle with him Mr Monckton instantly offered his services in assisting her and the next morning they went together to his house where after an  obstinate battle they gained a complete victory Mr Briggs gave up all his accounts and in a few days by the active interference of Mr Monckton her affairs were wholly taken out of his hands He stormed and prophesied all ill to Cecilia but it was not to any purpose he was so disagreeable to her by his manners and so unintelligible to her in matters of business that she was happy to have done with him even though upon inspecting his accounts they were all found clear and exact and his desire to retain his power over her fortune proved to have no other motive than a love of money so potent that to manage it even for another gave him a satisfaction he knew not how to relinquish  Mr Monckton who though a man of pleasure understood business perfectly well now instructed and directed her in making a general arrangement of her affairs The estate which devolved to her from her uncle and which was all in landed property she continued to commit to the management of the steward who was employed in his lifetime and her own fortune from her father which was all in the stocks she now diminished to nothing by selling out to pay Mr Monckton the principal and interest which she owed him and by settling with her Bookseller  While these matters were transacting which notwithstanding her eagerness to leave town could not be brought into such a train as to permit her absence in less than a week she passed her time chiefly alone Her wishes all inclined her to bestow it upon Henrietta but the late attack of Mr Delvile had frightened her from keeping up that connection since however carefully she might confine it to the daughter Mrs Belfield she was certain would impute it all to the son  That attack rested upon her mind in defiance of all her endeavours to banish it the contempt with which it was made seemed intentionally offensive as if he had been happy to derive from her supposed ill conduct a right to triumph over as well as reject her She concluded also that Delvile would be informed of these calumnies yet she judged his generosity by her own and was therefore convinced he would not credit them but what chiefly at this time encreased her sadness and uneasiness was the mention of Mrs Delvile's broken constitution and ruined health She had always preserved for that lady the most affectionate respect and could not consider herself as the cause of her sufferings without feeling the utmost concern however conscious she had not wilfully occasioned them  Nor was this scene the only one by which her efforts to forget this family were defeated her watchful monitor Albany failed not again to claim her promise and though Mr Monckton earnestly exhorted her not to trust herself out with him she preferred a little risk to the keenness of his reproaches and the weather being good on the morning that he called she consented to accompany him in his rambles only charging her footman to follow whereever they went and not to fail enquiring for her if she stayed long out of his sight These precautions were rather taken to satisfy Mr Monckton than herself who having now procured intelligence of the former disorder of his intellects was fearful of some extravagance and apprehensive for her safety  He took her to a miserable house in a court leading into Piccadilly where up three pair of stairs was a wretched woman ill in bed while a large family of children were playing in the room  "See here"  cried he  "what human nature can endure look at that poor wretch distracted with torture yet lying in all this noise unable to stir in her bed yet without any assistant suffering the pangs of acute disease yet wanting the necessaries of life"  Cecilia went up to the bedside and enquired  more particularly into the situation of the invalid but finding she could hardly speak from pain she sent for the woman of the house who kept a Green Grocer's shop on the ground floor and desired her to hire a nurse for her sick lodger to call all the children down stairs and to send for an apothecary whose bill she promised to pay She then gave her some money to get what necessaries might be wanted and said she would come again in two days to see how they went on  Albany who listened to these directions with silent yet eager attention now clasped both his hands with a look of rapture and exclaimed  "Virtue yet livesand I have found her"  Cecilia proud of such praise and ambitious to deserve it chearfully said  "where Sir shall we go now"  "Home"  answered he with an aspect the most benign  "I will not wear out thy pity by rendering woe familiar to it"  Cecilia though at this moment more disposed for acts of charity than for business or for pleasure remembered that her fortune however large was not unlimited and would not press any further bounty for objects she knew not certain that occasions and claimants far beyond her ability of answering would but too frequently arise  among those with whom she was more connected she therefore yielded herself to his direction and returned to SohoSquare  Again however he failed not to call at the time she had appointed for revisiting the invalid to whom with much gladness he conducted her  The poor woman whose disease was a rheumatic fever was already much better she had been attended by an apothecary who had given her some alleviating medicine she had a nurse at her bedside and the room being cleared of the children she had had the refreshment of some sleep  She was now able to raise her head and make her acknowledgments to her benefactress but not a little was the surprise of Cecilia when upon looking in her face she said  "Ah madam I have seen you before"  "Cecilia who had not the smallest recollection of her in return desired to know when or where"  "When you were going to be married madam I was the PewOpener at Church"  Cecilia started with secret horror and involuntarily retreated from the bed while Albany with a look of astonishment exclaimed  "Marriedwhy then is it unknown"  Ask me not"  cried she hastily  "it is all a mistake"  "Poor thing"  cried he  "this then is the string thy nerves endure not to have touched sooner will I expire than a breath of mine shall make it vibrate Oh sacred be thy sorrow for thou canst melt at that of the indigent"  Cecilia then made a few general enquiries and heard that the poor woman who was a widow had been obliged to give up her office from the frequent attacks which she suffered of the rheumatism that she had received much assistance both from the Rector and the Curate of Church but her continual illness with the largeness of her family kept her distressed in spite of all help  Cecilia promised to consider what she could do for her and then giving her more money returned to Lady Margaret's  Albany who found that the unfortunate recollection of the PewOpener had awakened in his young pupil a melancholy train of reflections seemed now to compassionate the sadness which hitherto he had reproved and walking silently by her side till she came to SohoSquare said in accents of kindness  "Peace light upon thy head and dissipate thy woes"  and left her  "Ah when"  cried she to herself  "if thus they are to be revived forever"  Mr Monckton who observed that something had greatly affected her now expostulated warmly against Albany and his wild schemes  "You trifle with your own happiness"  he cried  "by witnessing these scenes of distress and you will trifle away your fortune upon projects you can never fulfil the very air in those miserable houses is unwholesome for you to breathe you will soon be infected with some of the diseases to which you so incautiously expose yourself and while not half you give in charity will answer the purpose you wish you will be plundered by cheats and sharpers till you have nothing left to bestow You must be more considerate for yourself and not thus governed by Albany whose insanity is but partially cured and whose projects are so boundless that the whole capital of the East India Company would not suffice to fulfil them"  Cecilia though she liked not the severity of this remonstrance acknowledged there was some truth in it and promised to be discreet and take the reins into her own hands  There remained for her however no other satisfaction and the path which had thus been pointed out to her grew more  and more alluring every step Her old friends the poor Hills now occurred to her memory and she determined to see herself in what manner they went on  The scene which this enquiry presented to her was by no means calculated to strengthen Mr Monckton's doctrine for the prosperity in which she found this little family amply rewarded the liberality she had shewn to it and proved an irresistible encouragement to similar actions Mrs Hill wept for joy in recounting how well she succeeded and Cecilia delighted by the power of giving such pleasure forgot all cautions and promises in the generosity which she displayed She paid Mrs Roberts the arrears that were due to her she discharged all that was owing for the children who had been put to school desired they might still be sent to it solely at her expence and gave the mother a sum of money to be laid out in presents for them all  To perform her promise with the PewOpener was however more difficult her ill health and the extreme youth of her children making her utterly helpless but these were not considerations for Cecilia to desert her but rather motives for regarding her as more peculiarly an object of charity She found she had once been a clearstarcher  and was a tolerable plain workwoman she resolved therefore to send her into the country where she hoped to be able to get her some business and knew that at least she could help her if unsuccessful and see that her children were brought up to useful employments The woman herself was enchanted at the plan and firmly persuaded the country air would restore her health Cecilia told her only to wait till she was well enough to travel and promised in the mean time to look out some little habitation for her She then gave her money to pay her bills and for her journey and writing a full direction where she would hear of her at Bury took leave of her till that time  These magnificent donations and designs being communicated to Albany seemed a renovation to him of youth spirit and joy while their effect upon Mr Monckton resembled an annihilation of all three to see money thus sported away which he had long considered as his own to behold those sums which he had destined for his pleasures thus lavishly bestowed upon beggars excited a rage he could with difficulty conceal and an uneasiness he could hardly endure and he languished he sickened for the time when he might put a period to such romantic proceedings  Such were the only occupations which interrupted the solitude of Cecilia except those which were given to her by actual business and the moment her affairs were in so much forwardness that they could be managed by letters she prepared for returning into the country She acquainted Lady Margaret and Mr Monckton with her design and gave orders to her servants to be ready to set off the next day  Mr Monckton made not any opposition and refused himself the satisfaction of accompanying her and Lady Margaret whose purpose was now answered and who wished to be in the country herself determined to follow her  CHAP VI A DISTURBANCE  THIS matter being settled at breakfast Cecilia having but one day more to spend in London knew not how to let it pass without taking leave of Henrietta though she chose not again to expose herself to the forward insinuations of her mother she sent her therefore a short note begging to see her at Lady Margaret's and acquainting her that the next day she was going out of town  Henrietta returned the following answer  To Miss BEVERLEY  Madam  My mother is gone to market and I must not go out without her leave I have run to the door at every knock this whole week in hopes you were coming and my heart has jumpt at every coach that has gone through the street Dearest lady why did you tell me you would come I should not have thought of such a great honour if you had  not put it in my head And now I have got the use of a room where I can often be alone for two or three hours together And so I shall this morning if it was possible my dear Miss Beverley could come But I don't mean to be teasing and I would not be impertinent or encroaching for the world but only the thing is I have a great deal to say to you and if you was not so rich a lady and so much above me I am sure I should love you better than any body in the whole world almost and now I dare say I shan't see you at all for it rains very hard and my mother I know will be sadly angry if I ask to go in a coach O dear I don't know what I can do for it will half break my heart if my dear Miss Beverley should go out of town and I not see her  I am Madam with the greatest respectfulness your most humble servant HENRIETTA BELFIELD  This artless remonstrance joined to the intelligence that she could see her alone made Cecilia instantly order a chair and go herself to Portlandstreet for she found by this letter there was much doubt if she could otherwise see her and the earnestness of Henrietta made her now not endure to disappoint her  "She has much cried she  to say to me and I will no longer refuse to hear her she shall unbosom to me her gentle heart for we have now nothing to fear from each other She promises herself pleasure from the communication and doubtless it must be some relief to her Oh were there any friendly bosom in which I might myself confidehappier Henrietta less fearful of thy pride less tenacious of thy dignity thy sorrows at least seek the consolation of sympathymine alas fettered by prudence must fly it"  She was shewn into the parlour which she had the pleasure to find empty and in an instant the warmhearted Henrietta was in her arms  "This is sweet of you indeed"  cried she  "for I did not know how to ask it though it rains so hard I could not have walked to you and I don't know what I should have done if you had gone away and quite forgot me"  She then took her into the back parlour which she said they had lately hired and as it was made but little use of she had it almost entirely to herself  There had passed a sad scene she told her at the meeting with her brother though now they were a little more comfortable yet her mother she was sure would never be at rest till he got into some higher way of life  "And indeed I have some hopes"  she continued  "that we shall be able by and bye to do something better for him for he has got one friend in the world yet thank God and such a noble friendindeed I believe he can do whatever he pleases for himthat is I mean I believe if he was to ask any thing for him there's nobody would deny him And this is what I wanted to talk to you about"  Cecilia who doubted not but she meant Delvile scarce knew how to press the subject though she came with no other view Henrietta however too eager to want solicitation went on  "But the question is whether we shall be able to prevail upon my brother to accept any thing for he grows more and more unwilling to be obliged and the reason is that being poor he is afraid I believe people should think he wants to beg of them though if they knew him as well as I do they would not long think that for I am sure he would a great deal rather be starved to death But indeed to say the truth I am afraid he has been sadly to blame in this affair and quarrelled when there was no need to be affronted for I have seen a gentleman who knows a great deal better than my brother what people should do and he says he took every thing  wrong that was done all the time he was at Lord Vannelt's"  "And how does this gentleman know it"  "O because he went himself to enquire about it for he knows Lord Vannelt very well and it was by his means my brother came acquainted with him And this gentleman would not have wished my brother to be used ill any more than I should myself so I am sure I may believe what he says But my poor brother not being a lord himself thought every body meant to be rude to him and because he knew he was poor he suspected they all behaved disrespectfully to him But this gentleman gave me his word that every body liked him and esteemed him and if he would not have been so suspicious they would all have done any thing for him in the world"  "You know this gentleman very well then"  O no madam  "she answered hastily"  I don't know him at all he only comes here to see my brother it would be very impertinent for me to call him an acquaintance of mine"  "Was it before your brother then he held this conversation with you"  "O no my brother would have been  affronted with him too if he had but he called here to enquire for him at the time when he was lost to us and my mother quite went down upon her knees to him to beg him to go to Lord Vannelt's and make excuses for him if he had not behaved properly but if my brother was to know this he would hardly speak to her again so when this gentleman came next I begged him not to mention it for my mother happened to be out and so I saw him alone"  "And did he stay with you long"  "No ma'am a very short time indeed but I asked him questions all the while and kept him as long as I could that I might hear all he had to say about my brother"  "Have you never seen him since"  "No ma'am not once I suppose he does not know my brother is come back to us Perhaps when he does he will call"  "Do you wish him to call"  "Me"  cried she blushing  "a littlesometimes I dofor my brother's sake"  "For your brother's sake Ah my dear Henriettabut tell meor  don't  tell me if you had rather notdid I not once see you kissing a letter perhaps it was from this same noble friend"  "It was not a letter madam"  said she  looking down  "it was only the cover of one to my brother"  "The cover of a letter onlyand that to your brotheris it possible you could so much value it"  "Ah madam  You  who are always used to the good and the wise who see no other sort of people but those in high life  you  can have no notion how they strike those that they are new tobut I who see them seldom and who live with people so very unlike themOh you cannot guess how sweet to  me  is every thing that belongs to them whatever has but once been touched by their hands I should like to lock up and keep for ever though if I was used to them as you are perhaps I might think less of them"  Alas thought Cecilia who by  them  knew she only meant  him  little indeed would further intimacy protect you  "We are all overready"  continued Henrietta  "to blame others and that is the way I have been doing all this time myself but I don't blame my poor brother now for living so with the great as I used to do for now I have seen a little more of the world I don't wonder any longer at his behaviour for I know how it is and I see that those who have had good educations  and kept great company and mixed with the worldO it is another thingthey seem quite a different speciesthey are so gentle so softmannered nothing comes from them but what is meant to oblige they seem as if they only lived to give pleasure to other people and as if they never thought at all of themselves"  "Ah Henrietta"  said Cecilia shaking her head  "you have caught the enthusiasm of your brother though you so long condemned it Oh have a care lest like him also you find it as pernicious as it is alluring"  "There is no danger for  me  madam"  answered she  "for the people I so much admire are quite out of my reach I hardly ever even see them and perhaps it may so happen I may see them no more"  "The people"  said Cecilia smiling  "are there then many you so much distinguish"  "Oh no indeed"  cried she eagerly  "there is only one there  can  beI mean there are only a few"  she checked herself and stopt  "Whoever you admire"  cried Cecilia  "your admiration cannot but honour yet indulge it not too far lest it should wander from your heart to your peace and make you wretched for life"  "Ah madamI see you know who is the particular person I was thinking of but indeed you are quite mistaken if you suppose any thing bad of me"  "Bad of you"  cried Cecilia embracing her  "I scarce think so well of any one"  "But I mean madam if you think I forget he is so much above me But indeed I never do for I only admire him for his goodness to my brother and never think of him at all but just by way of comparing him sometimes to the other people that I see because he makes me hate them so that I wish I was never to see them again"  "His acquaintance then"  said Cecilia  "has done you but an ill office and happy it would be for you could you forget you had ever made it"  "O I shall never do that for the more I think of him the more I am out of humour with every body else O Miss Beverley we have a sad acquaintance indeed I'm sure I don't wonder my brother was so ahamed of them They are all so rude and so free and put one so out of countenanceO how different is this person you are thinking of he would not distress any body or make one ashamed for all the world  You  only are like him always gentle always obligingsometimes I think you must be his sisteronce too I heardbut that was contradicted"  A deep sigh escaped Cecilia at this speech she guessed too well what she might have heard and she knew too well how it might be contradicted  "Surely  you  cannot be unhappy Miss Beverley"  said Henrietta with a look of mingled surprise and concern  "I have much I own"  cried Cecilia assuming more chearfulness  "to be thankful for and I endeavour not to forget it"  "O how often do I think"  cried Henrietta  "that you madam are the happiest person in the world with every thing at your own disposalwith every body in love with you with all the money that you can wish for and so much sweetness that nobody can envy you it with power to keep just what company you please and every body proud to be one of the numberOh if I could chuse who I would be I should sooner say Miss Beverley than any princess in the world"  Ah thought Cecilia if such is my situationhow cruel that by one dreadful blow all its happiness should be thrown away  "Were I a rich lady like you"  continued Henrietta  "and quite in my own power then indeed I might soon think of nothing but those people that I admire and that makes me often wonder that  you  madam who are just such another as himself  but then indeed you may see so many of the same sort that just this one may not so much strike you and for that reason I hope with all my heart that he will never be married as long as he lives for as he must take some lady in just such high life as his own I should always be afraid that she would never love him as she ought to do"  He need not now be single thought Cecilia were that all he had cause to apprehend  "I often think"  added Henrietta  "that the rich would be as much happier for marrying the poor as the poor for marrying the rich for then they would take somebody that would try to deserve their kindness and now they only take those that know they have a right to it Often and often have I thought so about this very gentleman and sometimes when I have been in his company and seen his civility and his sweetness I have fancied I was rich and grand myself and it has quite gone out of my head that I was nothing but poor Henrietta Belfield"  "Did he then"  cried Cecilia a little alarmed  "ever seek to ingratiate himself into your favour"  "No never but when treated with so much softness 'tis hard always to remember  ones meanness You madam have no notion of that task no more had I myself till lately for I cared not who was high nor who was low but now indeed I must own I have sometimes wished myself richer yet he assumes so little that at other times I have almost forgot all distance between us and even thoughtOh foolish thought"  "Tell it sweet Henrietta however"  "I will tell you madam every thing for my heart has been bursting to open itself and nobody have I dared trust I have thought then I have sometimes thoughtmy true affection my faithful fondness my glad obediencemight make him if he did but know them happier in me than in a greater lady"  "Indeed"  cried Cecilia extremely affected by this plaintive tenderness  "I believe itand were I him I could not I think hesitate a moment in my choice"  Henrietta now hearing her mother coming in made a sign to her to be silent but Mrs Belfield had not been an instant in the passage before a thundering knocking at the streetdoor occasioned it to be instantly reopened A servant then enquired if Mrs Belfield was at home and being answered by herself in the affirmative a chair was brought into the house  But what was the astonishment of Cecilia when in another moment she heard from the next parlour the voice of Mr Delvile senior saying  "Your servant ma'am Mrs Belfield I presume"  There was no occasion now to make a sign to her of silence for her own amazement was sufficient to deprive her of speech  "Yes Sir"  answered Mrs Belfield  "but I suppose Sir you are some gentleman to my son"  "No madam"  he returned  "my business is with yourself"  Cecilia now recovering from her surprise determined to hasten unnoticed out of the house well knowing that to be seen in it would be regarded as a confirmation of all that he had asserted She whispered therefore to Henrietta that she must instantly run away but upon softly opening the door leading to the passage she found Mr Delvile's chairmen and a footman there in waiting  She closed it again irresolute what to do but after a little deliberation she concluded to outstay him as she was known to all his servants who would not fail to mention seeing her and a retreat so private was worse than any other risk A chair was also in waiting for herself but it was a hackney one and she could not be known by it and her  footman she had fortunately dismissed as he had business to transact for her journey next day  Meanwhile the thinness of the partition between the two parlours made her hearing every word that was said unavoidable  "I am sure Sir I shall be very willing to oblige you"  Mrs Belfield answered  "but pray Sir what's your name"  "My name ma'am"  he replied in a rather elevated voice  "I am seldom obliged to announce myself nor is there any present necessity I should make it known It is sufficient I assure you you are speaking to no very common person and probably to one you will have little chance to meet with again"  "But how can I tell your business Sir if I don't so much as know your name"  "My business madam I mean to tell myself your affair is only to hear it I have some questions indeed to ask which I must trouble you to answer but they will sufficiently explain themselves to prevent any difficulty upon your part There is no need therefore of any introductory ceremonial"  "Well Sir"  said Mrs Belfield wholly insensible of this ambiguous greatness  "if you mean to make your name a secret"  "Few names I believe ma'am"  cried  he haughtily  "have less the advantage of secrecy than mine on the contrary this is but one among a very few houses in this town to which my person would not immediately announce it That however is immaterial and you will be so good as to rest satisfied with my assurances that the person with whom you are now conversing will prove no disgrace to your character"  Mrs Belfield overpowered though hardly knowing with what only said  he was very welcome  and begged him to sit down  "Excuse me ma'am"  he answered  "My business is but of a moment and my avocations are too many to suffer my infringing that time You say you have a son I have heard of him also somewhere before pray will you give me leave to enquireI don't mean to go deep into the matterbut particular family occurrences make it essential for me to knowwhether there is not a young person of rather a capital fortune to whom he is supposed to make proposals"  "Lackaday no Sir"  answered Mrs Belfield to the infinite relief of Cecilia who instantly concluded this question referred to herself  "I beg your pardon then good morning to you ma'am"  said Mr Delvile in a tone that spoke his disappointment but  added  "And there is no such young person you say who favours his pretensions"  "Dear Sir"  cried she  "why there's nobody he'll so much as put the question to there's a young lady at this very time a great fortune that has as much a mind to him I tell him as any man need desire to see but there's no making him think it though he has been brought up at the university and knows more about all the things or as much as any body in the king's dominions"  "O then"  cried Mr Delvile in a voice of far more complacency  "it is not on the side of the young woman that the difficulty seems to rest"  "Lord no Sir he might have had her again and again only for asking She came after him ever so often but being brought up as I said at the university he thought he knew better than me and so my preaching was all as good as lost upon him"  The consternation of Cecilia at these speeches could by nothing be equalled but the shame of Henrietta who though she knew not to whom her mother made them felt all the disgrace and the shock of them herself  "I suppose Sir"  continued Mrs Belfield  "you know my son"  "No ma'am my acquaintance isnot very universal"  "Then Sir you are no judge how well he might make his own terms And as to this young lady she found him out Sir when not one of his own natural friends could tell where in the world he was gone She was the first Sir to come and tell me news of him though I was his own mother Love Sir is prodigious for quickness it can see I sometimes think through bricks and mortar Yet all this would not do he was so obstinate not to take the hint"  Cecilia now felt so extremely provoked she was upon the point of bursting in upon them to make her own vindication but as her passions though they tried her reason never conquered it she restrained herself by considering that to issue forth from a room in that house would do more towards strengthening what was thus boldly asserted than all her protestations could have chance to destroy  "And as to young ladies themselves"  continued Mrs Belfield  "they know no more how to make their minds known than a baby does so I suppose he'll shilly shally till somebody else will cry snap and take her It is but a little while ago that it was all the report she was to have young Mr Delvile one of her guardians sons"  "I am sorry report was so impertinent"  cried Mr Delvile with much displeasure  "young Mr Delvile is not to be disposed of with so little ceremony he knows better what is due to his family"  Cecilia here blushed from indignation and Henrietta sighed from despondency  "Lord Sir"  answered Mrs Belfield  "what should his family do better I never heard they were any so rich and I dare say the old gentleman being her guardian took care to put his son enough in her way however it came about that they did not make a match of it for as to old Mr Delvile all the world says"  "All the world takes a very great liberty"  angrily interrupted Mr Delvile  "in saying any thing about him and you will excuse my informing you that a person of his rank and consideration is not lightly to be mentioned upon every little occasion that occurs"  "Lord Sir"  cried Mrs Belfield somewhat surprised at this unexpected prohibition  "I don't care for my part if I never mention the old gentleman's name again I never heard any good of him in my life for they say he's as proud as Lucifer and nobody knows what it's of for they say"  "  They  say"  cried he firing with rage  "and who are  they  be so good as inform me that"  "Lord every body Sir it's his common character"  "Then every body is extremely indecent"  speaking very loud  "to pay no more respect to one of the first families in England It is a licentiousness that ought by no means to be suffered with impunity"  Here the streetdoor being kept open by the servants in waiting a new step was heard in the passage which Henrietta immediately knowing turned with uplifted hands to Cecilia and whispered  "How unlucky it's my brother I though the would not have returned till night"  "Surely he will not come in here"  rewhispered Cecilia  But at the same moment he opened the door and entered the room He was immediately beginning an apology and starting back but Henrietta catching him by the arm told him in a low voice that she had made use of his room because she had thought him engaged for the day but  ged him to keep still and quiet as the  st noise would discover them  Belfield then stopt but the embarrass  of Cecilia was extreme to find her in his room after the speeches she had  from his mother and to continue  him in it by connivance when she  she had been represented as quite at  vice distressed and provoked her im  urably and she felt very angry with  Henrietta for not sooner informing her whose apartment she had borrowed Yet now to remove and to be seen was not to be thought of she kept therefore fixed to her seat though changing colour every moment from the variety of her emotions  During this painful interruption she lost Mrs Belfield's next answer and another speech or two from Mr Delvile to whose own passion and loudness was owing Belfield's entering his room unheard but the next voice that called their attention was that of Mr Hobson who just then walked into the parlour  "Why what's to do here"  cried he facetiously  "nothing but chairs and livery servants Why ma'am what is this your rout day Sir your most humble servant I ask pardon but I did not know you at first But come suppose we were all to sit down Sitting's as cheap as standing and what I say is this when a man's tired it's more agreeable"  "Have you any thing further ma'am"  said Mr Delvile with great solemnity  "to communicate to me"  "No Sir"  said Mrs Belfield rather angrily"  it's no business of mine to be communicating myself to a gentleman that I don't know the name of Why Mr Hobson how come you to know the gentleman"  "To know  me  "  repeated Mr Delvile scornfully  "Why I can't say much ma'am"  answered Mr Hobson  "as to my knowing the gentleman being I have been in his company but once and what I say is to know a person if one leaves but a quart in a hogshead it's two pints too much That's my notion But Sir that was but an ungain business at 'Squire Monckton's t'other morning Every body was nohow as one may say But Sir if I may be so free pray what is your private opinion of that old gentleman that talked so much out of the way"  "My private opinion Sir"  "Yes Sir I mean if its no secret for as to a secret I hold it's what no man has a right to enquire into being of its own nature it's a thing not to be told Now as to what I think myself my doctrine is this I am quite of the old gentleman's mind about some things and about others I hold him to be quite wide of the mark But as to talking in such a whisky frisky manner that nobody can understand him why it's tantamount to not talking at all being he might as well hold his tongue That's what  I  say And then as to that other article of abusing a person for not giving away all his lawful ga  s to every cripple in the streets just  because he happens to have but one leg or one eye or some such matter why it's knowing nothing of business it's what I call talking at random"  "When you have finished Sir"  said Mr Delvile  "you will be so good to let me know"  "I don't mean to intrude Sir that's not my way so if you are upon business"  "What else Sir could you suppose brought me hither However I by no means purpose any discussion I have only a few words more to say to this gentlewoman and as my time is not wholly inconsequential I should not be sorry to have an early opportunity of being heard"  "I shall leave you with the lady directly Sir for I know business better than to interrupt it but seeing chairs in the entry my notion was I should see ladies in the parlour not much thinking of gentlemen's going about in that manner being I never did it myself But I have nothing to offer against that let every man have his own way that's what  I say  Only just let me ask the lady before I go what's the meaning of my seeing two chairs in the entry and only a person for one in the parlour The gentleman I suppose did not come in  both  ha ha ha"  "Why now you put me in mind"  said Mrs Belfield  "I saw a chair as soon as I come in and I was just going to say who's here when this gentleman's coming put it out of my head"  "Why this is what I call Hocus Pocus work"  said Mr Hobson  "but I shall make free to ask the chairman who they are waiting for"  Mrs Belfield however anticipated him for running into the passage she angrily called out  "What do you do here Misters do you only come to be out of the rain I'll have no stand made of my entry I can tell you"  "Why we are waiting for the lady"  cried one of them  "Waiting for a fiddlestick"  said Mrs Belfield  "here's no lady here nor no company so if you think I'll have my entry filled up by two hulking fellows for nothing I shall shew you the difference One's dirt enough of one's own without taking people out of the streets to help one Who do you think's to clean after you"  "That's no business of ours the lady bid us wait"  answered the man  Cecilia at this dispute could with pleasure have cast herself out of the window to avoid being discovered but all plan of  ape was too late Mrs Belfield called a  d for her daughter and then returning  to the front parlour said  "I'll soon know if there's company come to my house without my knowing it"  and opened a door leading to the next room  Cecilia who had hitherto sat fixed to her chair now hastily arose but in a confusion too cruel for speech Belfield wondering even at his own situation and equally concerned and surprised at her evident distress had himself the feeling of a culprit though without the least knowledge of any cause and Henrietta terrified at the prospect of her mother's anger retreated as much as possible out of sight  Such was the situation of the discovered abashed perplexed and embarrassed while that of the discoverers far different was bold delighted and triumphant  "So"  cried Mrs Belfield  "why here's Miss Beverleyin my son's back room"  winking at Mr Delvile  "Why here's a lady sure enough"  said Mr Hobson  "and just where she should be and that is with a gentleman Ha ha that's the right way according to my notion that's the true maxim for living agreeable"  "I came to see Miss Belfield"  cried Cecilia endeavouring but vainly to speak with composure  "and she brought me into this room"  "I am but this moment"  cried Belfield with eagerness  "returned home and unfortunately broke into the room from total ignorance of the honour which Miss Beverley did my sister"  These speeches though both literally true sounded in the circumstances which brought them out so much as mere excuses that while Mr Delvile haughtily marked his incredulity by a motion of his chin Mrs Belfield continued winking at him most significantly and Mr Hobson with still less ceremony laughed aloud  "I have nothing more ma'am"  said Mr Delvile to Mrs Belfield  "to enquire for the few doubts with which I came to this house are now entirely satisfied Good morning to you ma'am"  "Give me leave Sir"  said Cecilia advancing with more spirit  "to explain in presence of those who can best testify my veracity the real circumstances"  "I would by no means occasion you such unnecessary trouble ma'am"  answered he with an air at once exulting and pompous  "the situation in which I see you abundantly satisfies my curiosity and saves me from the apprehension I was under of being again convicted of a  mistake  "  He then made her a stiff bow and went to his chair  Cecilia colouring deeply at this contemptuous treatment coldly took leave of Henrietta and courtsying to Mrs Belfield hastened into the passage to get into her own  Henrietta was too much intimidated to speak and Belfield was too delicate to follow her Mr Hobson only said  "The young lady seems quite dashed"  but Mrs Belfield pursued her with entreaties she would stay  She was too angry however to make any answer but by a distant bow of the head and left the house with a resolution little short of a vow never again to enter it  Her reflections upon this unfortunate visit were bitter beyond measure the situation in which she had been surprisedclandestinely concealed with only Belfield and his sisterjoined to the positive assertions of her partiality for him made by his mother could not to Mr Delvile but appear marks irrefragable that his charge in his former conversation was rather mild than overstrained and that the connection he had mentioned for whatever motives denied was incontestably formed  The apparent conviction of this part of the accusation might also authorise to one but too happy in believing ill of her an implicity faith in that which regarded her having  run out her fortune His determination not to hear her shewed the inflexibility of his character and it was evident notwithstanding his parading pretensions of wishing her welfare that his inordinate pride was inflamed at the very supposition he could be mistaken or deceived for a moment  Even Delvile himself if gone abroad might now hear this account with exaggerations that would baffle all his confidence his mother too greatly as she esteemed and loved her might have the matter so represented as to stagger her good opinionthese were thoughts the most afflicting she could harbour though their probability was such that to banish them was impossible  To apply again to Mr Delvile to hear her vindication was to subject herself to insolence and almost to court indignity She disdained even to write to him since his behaviour called for resentment not concession and such an eagerness to be heard in opposition to all discouragement would be practising a meanness that would almost merit repulsion  Her first inclination was to write to Mrs Delvile but what now to her was either her defence or accusation She had solemnly renounced all further intercourse with her she had declared against writing again  and prohibited her letters and therefore after much fluctuation of opinion her delicacy concurred with her judgment to conclude it would be most proper in a situation so intricate to leave the matter to chance and commit her character to time  In the evening while she was at tea with Lady Margaret and Miss Bennet she was suddenly called out to speak to a young woman and found to her great surprise she was no other than Henrietta  "Ah madam"  she cried  "how angrily did you go away this morning it has made me miserable ever since and if you go out of town without forgiving me I shall fret myself quite ill my mother is gone out to tea and I have run here all alone and in the dark and in the wet to beg and pray you will forgive me for else I don't know what I shall do"  "Sweet gentle girl  cried Cecilia affectionately embracing her  "if you had excited all the anger I am capable of feeling such softness as this would banish it and make me love you more than ever"  Henrietta then said in her excuse that she had thought herself quite sure of her brother's absence who almost always spent the whole day at the booksellers as in writing  himself he perpetually wanted to consult other authors and had very few books at their lodgings but she would not mention that the room was his lest Cecilia should object to making use of it and she knew she had no other chance of having the conversation with her she had so very long wished for She then again begged her pardon and hoped the behaviour of her mother would not induce her to give her up as she was shocked at it beyond measure and as her brother she assured her was as innocent of it as herself  Cecilia heard her with pleasure and felt for her an encreasing regard The openness of her confidence in the morning had merited all her affection and she gave her the warmest protestations of a friendship which she was certain would be lasting as her life  Henrietta then with a countenance that spoke the lightness of her heart hastily took her leave saying she did not dare be out longer lest her mother should discover her excursion Cecilia insisted however upon her going in a chair which she  ed her servant to attend and take care himself to discharge  This visit joined to the tender and unreserved conversation of the morning gave Cecilia the strongest desire invite her to  her house in the country but the terror of Mrs Belfield's insinuations added to the cruel interpretations she had to expect from Mr Delvile forbid her indulging this wish though it was the only one that just now she could form  CHAP VII A CALM  CECILIA took leave over night of the family as she would not stay their rising in the morning Mr Monckton though certain not to sleep when she was going forbearing to mark his solicitude by quitting his apartment at any unusual hour Lady Margaret parted from her with her accustomed ungraciousness and Miss Bennet because in her presence in a manner scarce less displeasing  The next morning with only her servants the moment it was light she set out Her journey was without incident or interruption and she went immediately to the house of Mrs Bayley where she had settled to board till her own was finished  Mrs Bayley was a mere good sort of woman who lived decently well with her servants and tolerably well with her neighbours upon a small annuity which made her easy and comfortable though by no means superior to such an addition to her little income as an occasional boarder might produce  Here Cecilia continued a full month which time had no other employment than what she voluntarily gave to herself by active deeds of benevolence  At Christmas to the no little joy of the neighbourhood she took possession of her own house which was situated about three miles from Bury  The better sort of people were happy to see her thus settled amongst them and the poorer who by what they already had received knew well what they still might expect regarded the day in which she fixed herself in her mansion as a day to themselves of prosperity and triumph  As she was no longer as hitherto repairing to a temporary habitation which at pleasure she might quit and to which at a certain period she could have no possible claim but to a house which was her own for ever or at least could solely by her own choice be transferred she determined as much as was in her power in quitting her desultory dwellings to empty her mind of the transactions which had passed in them and upon entering a house where she was permanently to reside to make the expulsion of her past sorrows the basis upon which to establish her future serenity  And this though a work of pain and difficulty was not impracticable her sensibility  indeed was keen and she had suffered from it the utmost torture but her feelings were not more powerful than her understanding was strong and her fortitude was equal to her trials Her calamities had saddened but not weakened her mind and the words of Delvile in speaking of his mother occurred to her now with all the conviction of experience that  "evils inevitable are always best supported because known to be past amendment and felt to give defiance to struggling"  See Vol IV p  A plan by which so great a revolution was to be wrought in her mind was not to be effected by any sudden effort of magnanimity but by a regular and even tenour of courage mingled with prudence Nothing therefore appeared to her so indispensable as constant employment by which a variety of new images might force their way in her mind to supplant the old ones and by which no time might be allowed for brooding over melancholy retrospections  Her first effort in this work of mental reformation was to part with Fidel whom hitherto she had almost involuntarily guarded but whom she only could see to revive the most dangerous recollections She sent him therefore to the castle but without  any message Mrs Delvile she was sure would require none to make her rejoice in his restoration  Her next step was writing to Albany who had given her his direction to acquaint him she was now ready to put in practice their long concerted scheme Albany instantly hastened to her and joyfully accepted the office of becoming at once her Almoner and her Monitor He made it his business to seek objects of distress and always but too certain to find them of conducting her himself to their habitations and then leaving to her own liberality the assistance their several cases demanded and in the overflowing of his zeal upon these occasions and the rapture of his heart in thus disposing almost at his pleasure of her noble fortune he seemed at times to feel an extasy that from its novelty and its excess was almost too exquisite to be borne He joined with the beggars in pouring blessings upon her head he prayed for her with the poor and he  ked her with the succoured  The pewopener and her children failed not to keep their appointment and Cecilia presently contrived to settle them in her neighbourhood where the poor woman as she recovered her strength soon got a little work and all deficiencies in her power of maintaining herself were supplied by her  generous patroness The children however she ordered to be coarsely brought up having no intention to provide for them but by helping them to common employments  The promise also so long made to Mrs Harrel of an apartment in her house was now performed That lady accepted it with the utmost alacrity glad to make any change in her situation which constant solitude had rendered wholly insupportable Mr Arnott accompanied her to the house and spent one day there but receiving from Cecilia though extremely civil and sweet to him no hint of any invitation for repeating his visit he left it in sadness and returned to his own in deep dejection Cecilia saw with concern how he nourished his hopeless passion but knew that to suffer his visits would almost authorise his feeding it and while she pitied unaffectedly the unhappiness she occasioned she resolved to double her own efforts towards avoiding similar wretchedness  This action however was a point of honour not of friendship the time being long since past that the society of Mrs Harrel could afford her any pleasure but the promises she had so often made to Mr Harrel in his distresses though extorted from her merely by the terrors of the moment  still were promises and therefore she held herself bound to fulfil them  Yet far from finding comfort in this addition to her family Mrs Harrel proved to her nothing more than a trouble and an incumbrance with no inherent resources she was continually in search of occasional supplies she fatigued Cecilia with wonder at the privacy of her life and tormented her with proposals of parties and entertainments She was eternally in amazement that with powers so large she had wishes so confined and was evidently disappointed that upon coming to so ample an estate she lived with respect to herself and her family with no more magnificence or shew than if Heiress to only  l  a year  But Cecilia was determined to think and to live for herself without regard to unmeaning wonder or selfish remonstrances she had neither ambition for splendour nor spirits for dissipation the recent sorrow of her heart had deadened it for the present to all personal taste of happiness and her only chance for regaining it seemed through the medium of bestowing it upon others She had seen too by Mr Harrel how wretchedly external brilliancy could cover inward woe and she had learned at Delvile Castle to grow sick of parade and grandeur Her equipage therefore was without glare  though not without elegance her table was plain though hospitably plentiful her servants were for use though too numerous to be for labour The system of her oeconomy like that of her liberality was formed by rules of reason and her own ideas of right and not by compliance with example nor by emulation with the gentry in her neighbourhood  But though thus deviating in her actions from the usual customs of the young and rich she was peculiarly careful not to offend them by singularity of manners When she mixed with them she was easy unaffected and well bred and though she saw them but seldom her good humour and desire of obliging kept them always her friends The plan she had early formed at Mrs Harrel's she now studied daily to put in practice but that part by which the useless or frivolous were to be excluded her house she found could only be supported by driving from her half her acquaintance  Another part also of that project she found still less easy of adoption which was solacing herself with the society of the wise good and intelligent Few answered this description and those few were with difficulty attainable Many might with joy have sought out her liberal dwelling but no one had idly waited till the moment it was at her disposal All who possessed at once  both talents and wealth were so generally courted they were rarely to be procured and all who to talents alone owed their consequence demanded if worth acquiring time and delicacy to be obtained Fortune she knew however was so often at war with Nature that she doubted not shortly meeting those who would gladly avail themselves of her offered protection  Yet tired of the murmurs of Mrs Harrel she longed for some relief from her society and her desire daily grew stronger to owe that relief to Henrietta Belfield The more she meditated upon this wish the less unattainable it appeared to her till by frequently combating its difficulties she began to consider them imaginary Mrs Belfield while her son was actually with herself might see she took not Henrietta as his appendage and Mr Delvile should he make further enquiries might hear that her real connection was with the sister since she received her in the country where the brother made no pretence to follow her She considered too how ill she should be rewarded in giving up Henrietta for Mr Delvile who was already determined to think ill of her and whose prejudices no sacrifice would remove  Having hesitated therefore some time between the desire of present alleviation and  the fear of future mischief the consciousness of her own innocence at length vanquished all dread of unjust censure and she wrote an invitation to Henrietta enclosed in a letter to her mother  The answer of Henrietta expressed her rapture at the proposal and that of Mrs Belfield made no objection but to the expence  Cecilia therefore sent her own maid to travel with her into Suffolk with proper directions to pay for the journey  The gratitude of the delighted Henrietta at the meeting was boundless and her joy at so unexpected a mark of favour made her half wild Cecilia suffered it not to languish for want of kindness to support it she took her to her bosom became the soother of all her cares and reposed in her in return every thought that led not to Delvile  There however she was uniformly silent solemnly and eternally parted from him far from trusting the secret of her former connexion to Henrietta the whole study of her life was to drive the remembrance of it from herself  Henrietta now tasted a happiness to which as yet her whole life had been a stranger she was suddenly removed from turbulent vulgarity to the enjoyment of  calm elegance and the gentleness of her disposition instead of being tyrannically imposed upon not only made her loved with affection but treated with the most scrupulous delicacy Cecilia had her share in all the comfort she bestowed she had now a friend to oblige and a companion to converse with She communicated to her all her schemes and made her the partner of her benevolent excursions she found her disposition as amiable upon trial as her looks and her manners had been engaging at first sight and her constant presence and constant sweetness imperceptibly revived her spirits and gave a new interest to her existence  Meantime Mr Monckton who returned in about a fortnight to the Grove observed the encreasing influence of Albany with the most serious concern The bounties of Cecilia extensive magnificent unlimited were the theme of every tongue and though sometimes censured and sometimes admired they were wondered at universally He suffered her for a while to go on without remonstrance hoping her enthusiasm would abate as its novelty wore out but finding that week following week was still distinguished by some fresh act of beneficence he grew so alarmed and uneasy he could restrain himself no longer He spoke to her with warmth he represented  her conduct as highly dangerous in its consequence he said she would but court impostors from every corner of the kingdom called Albany a lunatic whom she should rather avoid than obey and insinuated that if a report was spread of her proceedings a charity so prodigal would excite such alarm that no man would think even her large and splendid fortune would ensure him from ruin in seeking her alliance  Cecilia heard this exhortation without either terror or impatience and answered it with the utmost steadiness His influence over her mind was no longer uncontrolled for though her suspicions were not strengthened they had never been removed and friendship has no foe so dangerous as distrust She thanked him however for his zeal but assured him his apprehensions were groundless since though she acted from inclination she acted not without thought Her income was very large and she was wholly without family or connection to spend it merely upon herself would be something still worse than extravagance it must result from wilfulness the most inexcusable as her disp  sition was naturally averse to luxury and expence She might save indeed but for whom not a creature had such a claim upon her and with regard  to herself she was so provided for it would be unnecessary She would never she declared run in debt even for a week but while her estate was wholly clear she would spend it without restriction  To his hint of any future alliance she only said that those who disapproved her conduct would probably be those she should disapprove in her turn should such an event however take place the retrenching from that time all her present peculiar expences would surely in a clear  l  ayear leave her rich enough for any man without making it incumbent upon her at present to deny herself the only pleasure she could taste in bestowing that money which to her was superfluous upon those who received it as the prolongation of their existence  A firmness so deliberate in a system he so much dreaded greatly shocked Mr Monckton though it intmidated him from opposing it he saw she was too earnest and too well satisfied she was right to venture giving her disg  by controverting her arguments the conversation therefore ended with new discontent to himself and with an impression upon the mind of Cecilia that though he was zealous and friendly he was somewhat too worldly and suspicious  She went on therefore as before distributing  with a lavish hand all she could spare from her own houshold careful of nothing but of guarding against imposition which though she sometimes unavoidably endured her discernment and the activity of her investigating diligence saved her from suffering frequently And the steadiness with which she repulsed those whom she detected in deceit was a check upon tricks and fraud though it could not wholly put a stop to them  Money to her had long appeared worthless and valueless it had failed to procure her the establishment for which she once flattered herself it seemed purposely designed it had been disdained by the Delviles for the sake of whose connection she had alone ever truly rejoiced in possessing it and after such a conviction of its inefficacy to secure her happiness she regarded it as of little importance to herself and therefore thought it almost the due of those whose distresses gave it a consequence to which with her it was a stranger  In this manner with Cecilia passed the first winter of her majority She had sedulously filled it with occupations and her occupations had proved fertile in keeping her mind from idleness and in restoring it to chearfulness Calls upon her attention  so soothing and avocations so various for her time had answered the great purpose for which originally she had planned them in almost forcing from her thoughts those sorrows which if indulged would have rested in them incessantly  CHAP VIII AN ALARM  THE spring was now advancing and the weather was remarkably fine when one morning while Cecilia was walking with Mrs Harrel and Henrietta on the lawn before her house to which the last dinner bell was just summoning them to return Mrs Harrel looked round and stopt at sight of a gentleman galloping towards them who in less than a minute approached and dismounting and leaving his horse to his servant struck them all at the same instant to be no other than young Delvile  A sight so unexpected so unaccountable so wonderful after an absence so long and to which they were mutually bound almost wholly overpowered Cecilia from surprise and a thousand other feelings and she caught Mrs Harrel by the arm not knowing what she did as if for succour while Henrietta with scarce less though much more glad emotion suddenly exclaimed  "'tis Mr Delvile"  and sprang forward to meet him  He had reached them and in a voice that spoke hurry and perturbation respectfully made his compliments to them all before Cecilia recovered even the use of her feet but no sooner were they restored to her than she employed them with the quickest motion in her power still leaning upon Mrs Harrel to hasten into the house Her solemn promise to Mrs Delvile became uppermost in her thoughts and her surprise was soon succeeded by displeasure that thus without any preparation he forced her to break it by an interview she had no means to prevent  Just as they reached the entrance into the house the Butler came to tell Cecilia that dinner was upon the table Delvile then went up to her and said  "May I wait upon you for one instant beforeor after you dine"  "I am engaged Sir"  answered she though hardly able to speak  "for the whole day"  "You will not I hope refuse to hear me"  cried he eagerly  "I cannot write what I have to say"  "There is no occasion that you should Sir"  interrupted she  "since I should scarcely find time to read it"  She then courtsied though without looking at him and went into the house Delvile  remaining in utter dismay not daring however wishing to follow her But when Mrs Harrel much surprised at behaviour so unusual from Cecilia approached him with some civil speeches he started and wishing her good day bowed and remounted his horse pursued by the soft eyes of Henrietta till wholly out of sight  They then both followed Cecilia to the diningparlour  Had not Mrs Harrel been of this small party the dinner would have been served in vain Cecilia still trembling with emotion bewildered with conjecture angry with Delvile for thus surprising her angry with herself for so severely receiving him amazed what had tempted him to such a violation of their joint agreement and irresolute as much what to wish as what to think was little disposed for eating and with difficulty compelled herself to do the honours of her table  Henrietta whom the sight of Delvile had at once delighted and disturbed whom the behaviour of Cecilia had filled with wonder and consternation and whom the evident inquietude and disappointment which that behaviour had given to Delvile had struck with grief and terror could not swallow even a morsel but having cut her  meat about her plate gave it untouched to a servant  Mrs Harrel however though she had had her share in the surprise had wholly escaped all other emotion and only concluded in her own mind that Cecilia could sometimes be out of humout and ill bred as well as the rest of the world  While the desert was serving a note was brought to Henrietta which a servant was waiting in great haste to have answered  Henrietta stranger to all forms of politeness though by nature soft obliging and delicate opened it immediately she started as she cast her eye over it but blushed sparkled and looked enchanted and hastily rising without even a thought of any apology ran out of the room to answer it  Cecilia whose quick eye by a glance unavoidable had seen the hand of Delvile was filled with new amazement at the sight As soon as the servants were gone she begged Mrs Harrel to excuse her and went to her own apartment  Here in a few minutes she was followed by Henrietta whose countenance beamed with pleasure and whose voice spoke tumultuous delight  "My dear dear Miss Beverley"  she cried  "I have such a thing to tell youyou would never guess itI don't know how to believe it myselfbut  Mr Delvile has written to mehe has indeed that note was from himI have been locking it up for fear of accidents but I'll run and fetch it that you may see it yourself"  She then ran away leaving Cecilia much perplexed much uneasy for herself and both grieved and alarmed for the too tender too susceptible Henrietta who was thus easily the sport of every airy and credulous hope  "If I did not shew it you"  cried Henrietta running back in a moment  "you would never think it possible for it is to make such a requestthat it has frightened me almost out of my wits"  Cecilia then read the note  TO Miss BELFIELD  Mr Delvile presents his compliments to Miss Belfield and begs to be permitted to wait upon her for a few minutes at any time in the afternoon she will be so good as to appoint  "Only think"  cried the rapturous Henrietta  "it was  me  poor simple  me  of all people that he wanted so to speak withI am sure I thought a different thought when he went away but do dearest Miss  Beverley tell me this one thing what do you think he can have to say to me"  "Indeed"  replied Cecilia extremely embarrassed  "it is impossible for me to conjecture"  "If  you  can't I am sure then it is no wonder  I  can't and I have been thinking of a million of things in a minute It can't be about any business because I know nothing in the world of any business and it can't be about my brother because he would go to our house in town about him and there he would see him himself and it can't be about my dear Miss Beverley because then he would have written the note to her and it can't be about any body else because I know nobody else of his acquaintance"  Thus went on the sanguine Henrietta settling whom and what it could  not  be about till she left but the one thing to which her wishes pointed that it  could  be about Cecilia heard her with true compassion certain that she was deceiving herself with imaginations the most pernicious yet unable to know how to quell them while in such doubt and darkness herself  This conversation was soon interrupted by a message that a gentleman in the parlour begged to speak with Miss Belfield  "O dearest dearest Miss Beverley"  cried Henrietta with encreasing agitation  "what in the world shall I say to him advise me pray advise me for I can't think of a single word"  "Impossible my dear Henrietta unless I knew what he would say to you"  "O but I can guess I can guess"  cried she her cheeks glowing while her whole frame shook  "and I sha'n't know what in the whole world to answer him I know I shall behave like a foolI know I shall disgrace myself sadly"  Cecilia truly sorry Delvile should see her in such emotion endeavoured earnestly to compose her though never less tranquil herself But she could not succeed and she went down stairs with expectations of happiness almost too potent for her reason  Not such were those of Cecilia a dread of some new conflict took possession of her mind that mind so long tortured with struggles so lately restored to serenity  Henrietta soon returned but not the same Henrietta she wentthe glow the hope the flutter were all over she looked pale and wan but attempting as she entered the room to call up a smile she failed and burst into tears  Cecilia threw her arms round her neck and tried to console her but happy to hide her face in her bosom she only gave  the freer indulgence to her grief and rather melted than comforted by her tenderness sobbed aloud  Cecilia too easily conjectured the disappointment she had met to pain her by asking it she forbore even to gratify her own curiosity by questions that could not but lead to her mortification and suffering her therefore to take her own time for what she had to cummunicate she hung over her in silence with the most patient pity  Henrietta was very sensible of this kindness though she knew not half its merit but it was a long time before she could articulate for sobbing that  all  Mr Delvile wanted at last was only to beg she would acquaint Miss Beverley that he had done himself the honour of waiting upon her with a message from Mrs Delvile  "From Mrs Delvile"  exclaimed Cecilia all emotion in her turn  "good heaven how much then have I been to blame where is he nowwhere can I send to himtell me my sweet Henrietta this instant"  Oh madam"  cried Henrietta bursting into a fresh flood of tears  "how foolish have I been to open my silly heart to youhe is come to pay his addresses to youI am sure he is"  "No no no"  cried Cecilia  "indeed  he is notbut I must I ought to see himwhere my love is he"  "In the parlourwaiting for an answer"  Cecilia who at any other time would have been provoked at such a delay in the delivery of a message so important felt now nothing but concern for Henrietta whom she hastily kissed but instantly however quitted and hurried to Delvile with expectations almost equally sanguine as those her poor friend but the moment before had crushed  "Oh now thought she if at last Mrs Delvile herself has relented with what joy will I give up all reserve all disguise and frankly avow the faithful affection of my heart"  Delvile received her not with the eagerness with which he had first addressed her he looked extremely disturbed and even after her entrance undetermined how to begin  She waited however his explanation in silence and after an irresolute pause he said with a gravity not wholly free from resentment  "I presumed madam to wait upon you from the permission of my mother but I believe I have obtained it so late that the influence I hoped from it is past"  "I had no means Sir"  answered she chearfully  "to know that you came from her I should else have received her commands without any hesitation"  "I would thank you for the honour you do her were it less pointedly exclusive I have however no right of reproach yet suffer me to ask could you madam after such a parting after a renunciation so absolute of all future claim upon you which though extorted from me by duty I was bound having promised to fulfil by principlecould you imagine me so unsteady so dishonourable as to obtrude myself into your presence while that promise was still in force"  "I find  cried Cecilia in whom a secret hope every moment grew stronger  "I have been too hasty I did indeed believe Mrs Delvile would never authorise such a visit but as you have so much surprised me I have a right to your pardon for a little doubt"  "There spoke Miss Beverley"  cried Delvile reanimating at this little apology  "the same the unaltered Miss Beverley I hoped to findyet  is  she unaltered am I not too precipitate and is the tale I have heard about Belfield a dream an error a falsehood"  But that so quick a succession of quarrels"  said Cecilia half smiling  "would be endless perplexity I now would be affronted that you can ask me such a question"  "Had I indeed  thought  it a question"  cried he  "I would not have asked it but never for a moment did I credit it till the rigour of your repulse alarmed me You have condescended now to account for that and I am therefore encouraged to make known to you the purpose of my venturing this visit Yet not with confidence shall I speak if scarce even with hopeit is a purpose that is the offspring of despair"  One thing Sir"  cried Cecilia who now became frightened again  "let me say before you proceed if your purpose has not the sanction of Mrs Delvile as well as your visit I would gladly be excused hearing it since I shall most certainly refuse it"  I would mention nothing"  answered he  "without her concurrence she has given it me and my father himself has permitted my present application"  "Good Heaven"  cried Cecilia  "is it possible"  clasping her hands together in the eagerness of her surprise and delight  "  Is it possible  "  repeated Delvile with a look of rapture  "ah Miss Beverley  once my own Ceciliado you can you  wish  it possible"  No no"  cried she while pleasure and expectation sparkled in her eyes  "I wish nothing about itYet tell me how it has happenedI am  curious  "  added she smiling  "though not interested in it"  "What hope would this sweetness give me"  cried he  "were my scheme almost any other than it isbut you cannotno it would be unreasonableit would be madness to expect your complianceit is next to madness even in me to wish itbut how shall a man who is desperate be prudent and circumspect"  "Spare spare yourself"  cried the ingenuous Cecilia  "this unnecessary painyou will find from me no unnecessary scruples"  "You know not what you sayall noble as you are the sacrifice I have to propose"  "Speak it"  cried she  "with confidence speak it even with certainty of success I will be wholly undisguised and openly honestly own to you that no proposal no sacrifice can be mentioned to which I will not instantly agree if first it has had the approbation of Mrs Delvile"  Delvile's gratitude and thanks for a concession never before so voluntarily made  to him interrupted for a while even his power of explaining himself And now for the first time Cecilia's sincerity was chearful since now for the first time it seemed opposed by no duty  When still therefore he hesitated she herself held out her hand to him saying  "what must I do more must I offer this pledge to you"  "For my life would I not resign it"  cried he delightedly receiving it  "but oh how soon will you withdraw it when the only terms upon which I can hold it are those of making it sign from itself its natural right and inheritance"  Cecilia not comprehending him only looked amazed and he proceeded  "Can you for my sake make such a sacrifice as this can you for a man who for yours is not permitted to give up his name give up yourself the fortune of your late uncle consent to such settlements as I can make upon you from my own part with so splendid an income wholly and foreverand with only your paternal  l  condescend to become mine as if your uncle had never existed and you had been Heiress to no other wealth"  This indeed was a stroke to Cecilia unequalled by any she had met and more cruel than any she could have in reserve  At the proposal of parting with her uncle's fortune which desirable as it was had as yet been only productive to her of misery her heart disinterested and wholly careless of money was prompt to accede to the condition but at the mention of her paternal fortune that fortune of which now not the smallest vestige remained horror seized all her faculties she turned pale she trembled she involuntarily drew back her hand and betrayed by speechless agitation the sudden agonies of her soul  Delvile struck by this evident dismay instantly concluded his plan had disgusted her He waited some minutes in anxious expectation of an answer but finding her silence continue while her emotion encreased the deepest crimson dyed his face and unable to check his chagrin though not daring to confess his disappointment he suddenly quitted her and walked in much disorder about the room But soon recovering some composure from the assistance of pride  "Pardon madam"  he said  "a trial such as no man can be vindicated in making I have indulged a romantic whim which your better judgment disapproves and I receive but the mortification my presumption deserved"  "You know not then"  said Cecilia  in a faint voice  "my inability to comply"  "Your ability or inability I presume are elective"  "Oh nomy power is lostmy fortune itself is gone"  "Impossible utterly impossible"  cried he with vehemence  "Oh that it wereyour father knows it but too well"  "My father"  "Did he then never hint it to you"  "Oh distraction"  cried Delvile  "what horrible confirmation is coming"  and again he walked away as if wanting courage to hear her  Cecilia was too much shocked to force upon him her explanation but presently returning to her he said  "  you  only could have made this credible"  "Had you then actually heard it"  "Oh I had heard it as the most infamous of falshoods my heart swelled with indignation at so villainous a calumny and had it not come from my father my resentment at it had been inveterate"  "Alas"  cried Cecilia  "the fact is undeniable yet the circumstances you may have heard with it are I doubt not exaggerated"  "Exaggerated indeed"  he answered  "I was told you had been surprised concealed with Belfield in a back room I was told that your parental fortune was totally exhausted and that during your minority you had been a dealer with Jews I was told all this by my fatheryou may believe I had else not easily been made hear it"  "Yet thus far"  said she  "he told you but what is true though"  "True"  interrupted Delvile with a start almost frantic  "Oh never then was truth so scandalously wrongedI denied the whole chargeI disbelieved every syllableI pledged my own honour to prove every assertion false"  Generous Delvile"  cried Cecilia melting into tears  "this is what I expected from you and believe me in  your  integrity my reliance had been similar"  "Why does Miss Beverley weep"  cried he softened and approaching her  "and why has she given me this alarm these things must at least have been misrepresented deign then to clear up a mystery in which suspense is torture"  Cecilia then with what precision and clearness her agitation allowed her related the whole history of her taking up the money of the Jew for Mr Harrel and told without reserve the reason of her trying to abscond from his father at Mrs Belfield's  Delvile listened to her account with almost an agony of attention now admiring her conduct now resenting her ill usage now compassionating her losses but though variously moved by different parts receiving from the whole the delight he most coveted in the establishment of her innocence  Thanks and applause the warmest both accompanied and followed her narration and then at her request he related in return the several incidents and circumstances to which he had owed the permission of this visit  He had meant immediately to have gone abroad but the indisposition of his mother made him unwilling to leave the kingdom till her health seemed in a situation less precarious That time however came not the Winter advanced and she grew evidently worse He gave over therefore his design till the next Spring when if she were able it was her desire to try the South of France for her recovery whither he meant to conduct her  But during his attendance upon her the plan he had just mentioned occurred to him and he considered how much greater would be his chance of happiness in marrying Cecilia with scarce any fortune at all than in marrying another with the largest  He was convinced she was far other than expensive or a lover of shew and soon flattered himself she might be prevailed upon to concur with him that in living together though comparatively upon little they should mutually be happier than in living asunder upon much  When he started this scheme to his mother she heard it with mingled admiration of his disinterestedness and regret at its occasion yet the loftiness of her own mind her high personal value for Cecilia her anxiety to see her son finally settled while she lived lest his disappointment should keep him single from a lasting disgust joined to a dejection of spirits from an apprehension that her interference had been cruel all favoured his scheme and forbid her resistance She had often protested in their former conflicts that had Cecilia been portionless her objections had been less than to an estate so conditioned and that to give to her son a woman so exalted in herself she would have conquered the mere opposition of interest though that of family honour she held invincible Delvile now called upon her to remember those words and ever strict in fidelity she still promised to abide by them  Ah thought Cecilia is virtue then as inconsistent as vice and can the same character  be thus highsouled thus nobly disinterested with regard to riches whose pride is so narrow and so insurmountable with respect to family prejudice  Yet such a sacrifice from Cecilia herself whose income intitled her to settlements the most splendid Mrs Delvile thought scarcely to be solicited but as her son was conscious he gave up in expectation no less than she would give up in possession he resolved upon making the experiment and felt an internal assurance of success  This matter being finally settled with his mother the harder task remained of vanquishing the father by whom and before whom the name of Cecilia was never mentioned not even after his return from town though loaded with imaginary charges against her Mr Delvile held it a diminution of his own in the honour of his son to suppose he wanted still fresh motives for resigning her He kept therefore to himself the ill opinion he brought down as a resource in case of danger but a resource he disdained to make use of unless driven to it by absolute necessity  But at the new proposal of his son the accusation held in reserve broke out he called Cecilia a dabler with Jews and said she had been so from the time of her uncle's death he charged her with the grossest  general extravagance to which he added a most insiduous attack upon her character drawn from her visits at Belfield's of long standing as well as the particular time when he had himself surprised her concealed with the young man in a back parlour and he asserted that most of the large sums she was continually taking up from her fortune were lavished without scruple upon this dangerous and improper favourite  Delvile had heard this accusation with a rage scarce restrained from violence confident in her innocence he boldly pronounced the whole a forgery and demanded the author of such cruel defamation Mr Delvile much offended refused to name any authority but consented with an air of triumph to abide by the effect of his own proposal and gave him a supercilious promise no longer to oppose the marriage if the terms he meant to offer to Miss Beverley of renouncing her uncle's estate and producing her father's fortune were accepted  "Oh little did I credit"  said Delvile in conclusion  "that he knew indeed so well this last condition was impracticable his assertions were without proof I thought them prejudiced surmises and I came in the full hope I should convict him of his error My mother too who warmly and  even angrily defended you was as firmly satisfied as myself that the whole was a mistake and that enquiry would prove your fortune as undiminished as your purity How will she be shocked at the tale I have now to unfold how irritated at your injuries from Harrel how grieved that your own too great benevolence should be productive of such black aspersions upon your character"  "I have been"  cried Cecilia  "too facile and too unguarded yet always at the moment I seemed but guided by common humanity I have ever thought myself secure of more wealth than I could require and regarded the want of money as an evil from which I was unavoidably exempted My own fortune therefore appeared to me of small consequence while the revenue of my uncle ensured me perpetual prosperityOh had I foreseen this moment"  "Would you then have listened to my romantic proposal"  "Would I have listeneddo you not see too plainly I could not have hesitated"  "Oh yet then most generous of human beings yet then be mine By our own oeconomy we will pay off our mortgages by living a while abroad we will  clear all our estates I will still keep the name to which my family is bigotted and my gratitude for your compliance shall make you forget what you lose by it"  "Speak not to me such words"  cried Cecilia hastily rising  "your friends will not listen to them neither therefore must I"  "My friends"  cried he with energy  "are henceforth out of the question my father's concurrence with a proposal he  knew  you had not power to grant was in fact a mere permission to insult you for if instead of dark charges he had given any authority for your losses I had myself spared you the shock you have so undeservedly received from hearing itBut to consent to a plan which  could  not be acceptedto make  me  a tool to offer indignity to Miss BeverleyHe has released me from his power by so erroneous an exertion of it and my own honour has a claim to which his commands must give place That honour binds me to Miss Beverley as forcibly as my admiration and no voice but her own shall determine my future destiny"  "That voice then"  said Cecilia  "again refers you to your mother Mr Delvile indeed has not treated me kindly and this last mock concession was unnecessary  cruelty but Mrs Delvile merits my utmost respect and I will listen to nothing which has not her previous sanction"  "But will her sanction be sufficient and may I hope in obtaining it the security of yours"  "When I have said I will hear nothing without it may you not almost inferI will refuse nothing with it"  The acknowledgements he would now have poured forth Cecilia would not hear telling him with some gaiety they were yet unauthorized by Mrs Delvile She insisted upon his leaving her immediately and never again returning without his mother's express approbation With regard to his father she left him totally to his own inclination she had received from him nothing but pride and incivility and determined to shew publicly her superior respect for Mrs Delvile by whose discretion and decision she was content to abide  "Will you not then from time to time"  cried Delvile  "suffer me to consult with you"  "No no"  answered she  "do not ask it I have never been insincere with you never but from motives not to be overcome reserved even for a moment I have told you I will put every thing into the power of Mrs Delvile but I will not a second  time risk my peace by any action unknown to her"  Delvile gratefully acknowledged her goodness and promised to require nothing more He then obeyed her by taking leave eager himself to put an end to this new uncertainty and supplicating only that her good wishes might follow his enterprise  And thus again was wholly broken the tranquility of Cecilia new hopes however faint awakened all her affections and strong fears but too reasonable interrupted her repose Her destiny once more was as undecided as ever and the expectations she had crushed retook possession of her heart  The suspicions she had conceived of Mr Monckton again occurred to her though unable to ascertain and unwilling to believe them she tried to drive them from her thoughts She lamented however with bitterness her unfortunate connexion with Mr Harrel whose unworthy impositions upon her kindness of temper and generosity now proved to her an evil far more serious and extensive than in the midst of her repugnance to them she had ever apprehended  CHAP IX A SUSPENSE  DELVILE had been gone but a short time before Henrietta her eyes still red though no longer streaming opened the parlour door and asked if she might come in  Cecilia wished to be alone yet could not refuse her  "Well madam"  cried she with a forced smile and constrained air of bravery  "did not I guess right"  "In what"  said Cecilia unwilling to understand her  "In what I said would happenI am sure you know what I mean"  Cecilia extremely embarrassed made no answer she much regretted the circumstances which had prevented an earlier communication and was uncertain whether now it would prove most kind or most cruel to acquaint her with what was in agitation which should it terminate in nothing was unnecessarily wounding her delicacy for the openness of her confidence and which  however serviceable it might prove to her in the end was in the means so rough and piercing she felt the utmost repugnance to the experiment  "You think me madam too free"  said Henrietta  "in asking such a question and indeed your kindness has been so great it may well make me forget myself but if it does I am sure I deserve you should send me home directly and then there is not much fear I shall soon be brought to my senses"  "No my dear Henrietta I can never think you too free I have told you already every thing I thought you would have pleasure in hearing whatever I have concealed I have been fearful would only pain you"  "I have  deserved  madam"  said she with spirit  "to be pained for I have behaved with the folly of a baby I am very angry with myself indeed I was old enough to have known betterand I ought to have been wise enough"  "You must then be angry with yourself next"  said Cecilia anxious to reencourage her  "for all the love that I bear you since to your openness and frankness it was entirely owing"  "But there are some things that people should  not  be frank in however I am only  come now to beg you will tell me madam when it is to beand don't think I ask out of nothing but curiosity for I have a very great reason for it indeed"  "What be my dear Henriettayou are very rapid in your ideas"  "I will tell you madam what my reason is I shall go away to my own homeand so I would if it were ten times a worse home than it isjust exactly the day before Because afterwards I shall never like to look that gentleman in the facenever neverfor married ladies I know are not to be trusted"  "Be not apprehensive you have no occasion Whatever may be my fate I will never be so treacherous as to betray my beloved Henrietta to  any  body"  "May I ask you madam one question"  "Certainly"  "Why did all this never happen before"  "Indeed"  cried Cecilia much distressed  "I know not that it will happen now"  "Why what dear madam can hinder it"  "A thousand thousand things nothing can be less secure"  "And then I am still as much puzzled as ever I heard a good while ago and we all heard that it was to be and I thought  that it was no wonder I am sure for I used often to think it was just what was most likely but afterwards we heard it was no such thing and from that moment I always believed there had been nothing at all in it"  "I must speak to you I find with sincerity my affairs have long been in strange perplexity I have not known myself what to expect one day has perpetually reversed the prospect of another and my mind has been in a state of uncertainty and disorder that has kept itthat still keeps it from comfort and from rest"  "This surprises me indeed madam I thought  you  were all happiness but I was sure you deserved it and I thought you had it for that reward And this has been the thing that has made me behave so wrong for I took it into my head I might tell you every thing because I concluded it could be nothing to you for if great people loved one another I always supposed they married directly poor people indeed must stay till they are able to settle but what in the whole world thought I if they like one another should hinder such a rich lady as Miss Beverley from marrying such a rich gentleman at once"  Cecilia now finding there was no longer any chance for concealment thought it better to give the poor Henrietta at least the  gratification of unreserved confidence which might somewhat sooth her uneasiness by proving her reliance in her faith She frankly therefore confessed to her the whole of her situation Henrietta wept at the recital with bitterness thought Mr Delvile a monster and Mrs Delvile herself scarce human pitied Cecilia with unaffected tenderness and wondered that the person could exist who had the heart to give grief to young Delvile She thanked her most gratefully for reposing such trust in her and Cecilia made use of this opportunity to enforce the necessity of her struggling more seriously to recover her indifferency  She promised she would not fail and forbore steadily from that time to name Delvile any more but the depression of her spirits shewed she had suffered a disappointment such as astonished even Cecilia Thought modest and humble she had conceived hopes the most romantic and though she denied even to herself any expectations from Delvile she involuntarily nourished them with the most sanguine simplicity To compose and to strengthen her became the whole business of Cecilia who during her present suspense could find no other employment in which she could take any interest  Mr Monckton to whom nothing was unknown that related to Cecilia was soon informed of Delvile's visit and hastened in the utmost alarm to learn its event She had now lost all the pleasure she had formerly derived from confiding in him but though averse and confused could not withstand his enquiries  Unlike the tender Henrietta's was his disappointment at this relation and his rage at such repeated trials was almost more than he could curb He spared neither the Delviles for their insolence of mutability in rejecting or seeking her at their pleasure nor herself for her easiness of submission in being thus the dupe of their caprices The subject was difficult for Cecilia to dilate up  she wished to clear as he deserved Delvile himself from any share in the censure and she felt hurt and offended at the charge of her own improper readiness yet shame and pride united in preventing much vindication of either and she heard almost in silence what with pain she bore to hear at all  He now saw with inexpressible disturbance that whatever was his power to make her uneasy he had none to make her retract and that the conditional promise she had given Delvile to be wholly governed by  his mother she was firm in regarding to be as sacred as one made at the altar  Perceiving this he dared trust his temper with no further debate he assumed a momentary calmness for the purpose of taking leave of her and with pretended good wishes for her happiness whatever might be her determination he stifled the reproaches with which his whole heart was swelling and precipitately left her  Cecilia affected by his earnestness yet perplexed in all her opinions was glad to be relieved from useless exhortations and not sorry in her present uncertainty that his visit was not repeated  She neither saw nor heard from Delvile for a week and augured nothing but evil from such delay The following letter then came by the post  To Miss BEVERLEY  April d  I MUST write without comments for I dare not trust myself with making any I must write without any beginning address for I know not how you will permit me to address you  I have lived a life of tumult since last compelled to leave you and when it may subside I am still in utter ignorance  The affecting account of the losses you have suffered thro' your beneficence to the Harrels and the explanatory one of the calumnies you have sustained from your kindness to the Belfields I related with the plainness which alone I thought necessary to make them felt I then told the high honour I had received in meeting with no other repulse to my proposal than was owing to an inability to accede to it and informed my mother of the condescending powers with which you had invested her In conclusion I mentioned my new scheme and firmly before I would listen to any opposition I declared that though wholly to their decision I left the relinquishing my own name or your fortune I was not only by your generosity more internally yours than ever but that since again I had ventured and with permission to apply to you I should hold myself hence forward unalterably engaged to you  And so I do and so I shall nor after a renewal so public will any prohibition but yours have force to keep me from throwing myself at your feet  My father's answer I will not mention I would I could forget it his prejudices are irremediable his resolutions are inflexible Who or what has worked him into him into an animosity so irreclaimable I cannot conjecture  nor will he tell but something darkly mysterious has part in his wrath and his injustice  My mother was much affected by your reference to herself Words of the sweetest praise broke repeatedly from her no other such woman she said existed no other such instance could be found of fidelity so exalted her son must have no heart but for low and mercenary selfishness if after a proof of regard so unexampled he could bear to live without her Oh how did such a sentence from lips so highly reverenced animate delight confirm and oblige me at once  The displeasure of my father at this declaration was dreadful his charges always as improbable as injurious now became too horrible for my ears he disbelieved you had taken up the money for Harrel he discredited that you visited the Belfields for Henrietta passion not merely banished his justice but clouded his reason and I soon left the room that at least I might not hear the aspersions he forbid me to answer  I left not however your fame to a weak champion my mother defended it with all the spirit of truth and all the confidence of similar virtue yet they parted without conviction and so mutually irritated with each other that they agreed to meet no more  This was too terrible and I instantly consolidated my resentment to my father and my gratitude to my mother into concessions and supplications to both I could not however succeed my mother was deeply offended my father was sternly inexorable nor here rests the evil of their dissention for the violence of the conflict has occasioned a return more alarming than ever of the illness of my mother  All her faith in her recovery is now built upon going abroad she is earnest to set off immediately but Dr Lyster has advised her to make London in her way and have a consultation of physicians before she departs  To this she has agreed and we are now upon the road thither  Such is at present the melancholy state of my affairs My mother  advised  me to write forgive me therefore that I waited  something more decisive to say I could prevail upon neither party to meet before the journey nor could I draw from my father the base fabricator of the calumnies by which he has been thus abused  Unhappily I have nothing more to add and whether intelligence such as this or total suspense would be least irksome I know not If my mother bears her journey tolerably well I have yet one more effort  to make and of that the success or the failure will be instantly communicated to Miss Beverley by her eternally devoted but half distracted  MORTIMER DELVILE  Scarcely could Cecilia herself decide whether this comfortless letter or none at all were preferable The implacability of Mr Delvile was shocking but his slandering her character was still more intolerable yet the praises of the mother and her generous vindication joined to the invariable reliance of Delvile upon her innocence conferred upon her an honour that offered some alleviation  The mention of a fabricator again brought Mr Monckton to her mind and not all her unwillingness to think him capable of such treachery could now root out her suspicions Delvile's temper however she knew was too impetuous to be trusted with this conjecture and her fear of committing injustice being thus seconded by prudence she determined to keep to herself doubts that could not without danger be divulged  She communicated briefly to Henrietta who looked her earnest curiosity the continuance of her suspense and to her own fate Henrietta became somewhat more reconciled when she saw that no station in life rendered happiness certain or permanent  CHAP X A RELATION  ANOTHER week past still without any further intelligence Cecilia was then summoned to the parlour and to Delvile himself  He looked hurried and anxious yet the glow of his face and the animation of his eyes immediately declared he at least came not to take leave of her  "Can you forgive"  cried he  "the dismal and unsatisfactory letter I wrote you I would not disobey you twice in the same manner and I could not till now have written in any other"  "The consultation with the physicians then"  said Cecilia  "is over"  "Alas yes and the result is most alarming they all agree my mother is in a dangerous way and they rather forbear to oppose than advise her going abroad but upon that she is earnestly bent and intends to set out without delay I shall return to her therefore with all speed and mean not to take any rest till I have seen her"  Cecilia expressed with tenderness her sorrow for Mrs Delvile nor were her looks illiberal in including her son in her concern  "I must hasten"  he cried  "to the credentials by which I am authorised for coming and I must hasten to prove if Miss Beverley has not flattered my mother in her appeal"  He then informed her that Mrs Delvile apprehensive for herself and softened for him by the confession of her danger which she had extorted from her physicians had tenderly resolved upon making one final effort for his happiness and ill and impatient as she was upon deferring her journey to wait its effect  Generously therefore giving up her own resentment she wrote to Mr Delvile in terms of peace and kindness lamenting their late dissention and ardently expressing her desire to be reconciled to him before she left England She told him the uncertainty of her recovery which had been acknowledged by her physicians who had declared a calmer mind was more essential to her than a purer air She then added that such serenity was only to be given her by the removal of her anxiety at the comfortless state of her son She begged him therefore to make known the author  of Miss Beverley's defamation assuring him that upon enquiry he would find her character and her fame as unsullied as his own and strongly representing that after the sacrifice to which she had consented their son would be utterly dishonourable in thinking of any other connexion She then to this reasoning joined the most earnest supplication protesting in her present disordered state of health her life might pay the forfeiture of her continual uneasiness  "I held out"  she concluded  "while his personal dignity and the honour of his name and family were endangered but where interest alone is concerned and that interest is combatted by the peace of his mind and the delicacy of his word my opposition is at an end And though our exttensive and well founded views for a splendid alliance are abolished you will agree with me hereafter upon a closer inspection that the object for whom he relinquishes them offers in herself the noblest reparation"  Cecilia felt gratified humbled animated and depressed at once by this letter of which Delvile brought her a copy  "And what"  cried she  "was the answer"  "I cannot in decency"  he replied  "speak my opinion of it read it yourselfand let me hear yours"  To the Honourable Mrs DELVILE  YOUR extraordinary letter madam has extremely surprised me I had been willing to hope the affair over from the time my disapprobation of it was formally announced I am sorry you are so much indisposed but I cannot conclude your health would be restored by my acceding to a plan so derogatory to my house I disapprove it upon every account not only of the name and the fortune but the lady herself I have reasons more important than those I assign but they are such as I am bound in honour not to mention After such a declaration nobody I presume will affront me by asking them Her defence you have only from herself her accusation I have received from authority less partial I command therefore that my son upon pain of my eternal displeasure may never speak to me on the subject again and I hope madam from you the same complaisance to my request I cannot explain myself further nor is it necessary it is no news I flatter myself to Mortimer Delvile or his mother that I do nothing without reason and I believe nothing upon slight grounds  A few cold compliments concerning her journey and the reestablishment of her health concluded the letter  Cecilia having read hastily returned it and indignantly said  "My opinion Sir upon this letter must surely be yours that we had done wiser long since to have spared your mother and ourselves those vain and fruitless conflicts which we ought better to have foreseen were liable to such a conclusion Now at least let them be ended and let us not pursue disgrace wilfully after suffering from it with so much rigour involuntarily"  "O no"  cried Delvile  "rather let us now spurn it for ever those conflicts must indeed be ended but not by a separation still more bitter than all of them"  He then told her that his mother highly offended to observe by the extreme coldness of this letter the rancour he still nourished for the contest preceding her leaving him no longer now refused even her separate consent for a measure which she thought her son absolutely engaged to take  "Good heaven"  cried Cecilia much amazed  "this from Mrs Delvilea separate consent"  "She has always maintained"  he answered  "an independent mind always judged for herself and refused all other  arbitration when so impetuously she parted us my father's will happened to be her's and thence their concurrence my father of a temper immoveable and stern retains stubbornly the prejudices which once have taken possession of him my mother generous as fiery and noble as proud is open to conviction and no sooner convinced than ingenuous in acknowledging it and thence their dissention From my father I may hope forgiveness but must never expect concession from my mother I may hope all she ought to grant for pardon but her vehemenceand she has every great quality that can dignify human nature"  Cecilia whose affection and reverence for Mrs Delvile were unfeigned and who loved in her son this filial enthusiasm readily concurred with him in praising her and sincerely esteemed her the first among women  "Now then"  cried he with earnestness"  now is the time when your generous admiration of her is put to the test see what she writes to youshe has left to me all explanation but I insisted upon some credential lest you should believe I only owed her concurrence to a happy dream"  Cecilia in much trepidation took the letter and hastily run it over  TO Miss BEVERLEY  MISERY my sweet young friend has long been busy with us all much have we owed to the clash of different interests much to that rapacity which to enjoy any thing demands every thing and much to that general perverseness which labours to place happiness in what is withheld Thus do we struggle on till we can struggle no longer the felicity with which we trifle at best is but temporary and before reason and reflection shew its value sickness and sorrow are commonly become stationary  Be it yours my love and my son's to profit by the experience while you pity the errors of the many who illustrate this truth Your mutual partiality has been mutually unfortunate and must always continue so for the interests of both but how blind is it to wait in our own peculiar lots for that perfection of enjoyment we can all see wanting in the lot of others My expectations for my son had  "outsteped the modesty of"  probability I looked for rank and high birth with the fortune of Cecilia and Cecilia's rare character Alas a new constellation in the  heavens might as rationally have been looked for  My extravagance however has been all for his felicity dearer to me than lifedearer to me than all things but his own honour Let us but save that and then let wealth ambition interest grandeur and pride since they cannot constitute his happiness be removed from destroying it I will no longer play the tyrant that weighing good and evil by my own feelings and opinions insists upon his acting by the notions I have formed whatever misery they may bring him by opposing all his own  I leave the kingdom with little reason to expect I shall return to it I leave itOh blindness of vanity and passionfrom the effect of that violence with which so lately I opposed what now I am content to advance But the extraordinary resignation to which you have agreed shews your heart so wholly my son's and so even more than worthy the whole possession of his that it reflects upon him an honour more bright and more alluring than any the most illustrious other alliance could now confer  I would fain see you ere I go lest I should see you no more fain ratify by word of mouth the consent that by word of mouth I so absolutely refused I know not how to come to Suffolkis it not possible you can  come to London I am told you leave to me the arbitration of your fatein giving you to my son I best shew my sense of such an honour  Hasten then my love to town that I may see you once more wait no longer a concurrence thus unjustly withheld but hasten that I may bless the daughter I have so often wished to own that I may entreat her forgiveness for all the pain I have occasioned her and committing to her charge the future happiness of my son fold to my maternal heart the two objects most dear to it  AUGUSTA DELVILE  Cecilia wept over this letter with tenderness grief and alarm but declared had it even summoned her to follow her abroad she could not after reading it have hesitated in complying  "O now then"  cried Delvile  "let our long suspenses end hear me with the candour my mother has already listened to mebe mine my Cecilia at onceand force me not by eternal scruples to risk another separation"  "Good heaven Sir"  cried Cecilia starting  "in such a state as Mrs Delvile thinks herself would you have her journey delayed"  "No not a moment I would but ensure you mine and go with her all over the world"  "Wild and impossibleand what is to be done with Mr Delvile"  "It is on his account wholly I am thus earnestly precipitate If I do not by an immediate marriage prevent his further interference all I have already suffered may again be repeated and some fresh contest with my mother may occasion another relapse"  Cecilia who now understood him ardently protested she would not listen for a moment to any clandestine expedient  He besought her to be patient and then anxiously represented to her their peculiar situations All application to his father he was peremptorily forbid making all efforts to remove his prejudices their impenetrable mystery prevented a public marriage therefore with such obstacles would almost irritate him to phrenzy by its daring defiance of his prohibition and authority  "Alas"  exclaimed Cecilia  "we can never do right but in parting"  "Say it not"  cried he  "I conjure you we shall yet live I hope to prove the contrary"  "And can you then"  cried she reproachfully  "Oh Mr Delvile can you  again urge me to enter your family in secret"  "I grieve indeed"  he answered  "that your goodness should so severely be tried yet did you not condescend to commit the arbitration to my mother"  "True and I thought her approbation would secure my peace of mind but how could I have expected Mrs Delvile's consent to such a scheme"  "She has merely accorded it from a certainty there is no other resource Believe me therefore my whole hope rests upon your present compliance My father I am certain by his letter will now hear neither petition nor defence on the contrary he will only enrage at the temerity of offering to confute him But when he knows you are his daughter  his  honour will then be concerned in yours and it will be as much his desire to have it cleared as it is now to have it censured"  "Wait at least your return and let us try what can be done with him"  "Oh why"  cried Delvile with much earnestness  "must I linger out month after month in this wretched uncertainty" If I wait I am undone my father by the orders I must unavoidably leave will discover the preparations making without his consent and he will work upon you in my absence and compel you to give me up"  "Are you sure"  said she half smiling  "he would have so much power"  "I am but too sure that the least intimation in his present irritable state of mind reaching him of my intentions would make him not scruple in his fury pronouncing some malediction upon my disobedience that  neither  of us I must own could tranquilly disregard"  This was an argument that came home to Cecilia whose deliberation upon it though silent was evidently not unfavourable  He then told her that with respect to settlements he would instantly have a bond drawn up similar to that prepared for their former intended union which should be properly signed and sealed and by which he would engage himself to make upon coming to his estate the same settlement upon her that was made upon his mother  "And as instead of keeping up three houses"  he continued  "in the manner my father does at present I mean to put my whole estate  out to nurse  while we reside for a while abroad or in the country I doubt not but in a very few years we shall be as rich and as easy as we shall desire"  He told her also of his wellfounded expectations from the Relations already mentioned which the concurrence of his  mother with his marriage would thence forward secure to him  He then with more coherence stated his plan at large He purposed without losing a moment to return to London he conjured her in the name of his mother to set out herself early the next day that the following evening might be dedicated wholly to Mrs Delvile through her intercession he might then hope Cecilia's compliance and every thing on the morning after should be prepared for their union The longdesired ceremony over he would instantly ride post to his father and pay him at least the respect of being the first to communicate it He would then attend his mother to the Continent and leave the arrangement of every thing to his return  "Still therefore as a single man"  he continued  "I mean to make the journey and I shall take care by the time I return to have all things in readiness for claiming my sweet Bride Tell me then now if you can reasonably oppose this plan"  "Indeed"  said Cecilia after some hesitation  "I cannot see the necessity of such violent precipitancy"  "Do you not try me too much"  cried Delvile impatiently  "to talk  now  of precipitancy after such painful waiting such  wearisome expectation I ask you not to involve your own affairs in confusion by accompanying me abroad sweet to me as would be such an indulgence I would not make a runaway of you in the opinion of the world All I wish is the secret certainty I cannot be robbed of you that no cruel machinations may again work our separation that you are mine unalterably mine beyond the power of caprice or ill fortune"  Cecilia made no answer tortured with irresolution she knew not upon what to determine  "We might then according to the favour or displeasure of my father settle wholly abroad for the present or occasionally visit him in England my mother would be always and openly our friendOh be firm then I conjure you to the promise you have given her and deign to be mine on the conditions she prescribes She will be bound to you for ever by so generous a concession and even her health may be restored by the cessation of her anxieties With such a wife such a mother what will be wanting for  me  Could I lament not being richer I must be rapacious indeedSpeak then my Cecilia relieve me from the agony of this eternal uncertainty and tell me your word is invariable as your honour and tell me my mother gives not her sanction in vain"  Cecilia sighed deeply but after some hesitation said  "I little knew what I promised nor know I now what to performthere must ever I find be some check to human happiness yet since upon these terms Mrs Delvile herself is content to wish me of her family"  She stopt but urged earnestly by Delvile added  "I must not I think withdraw the powers with which I entrusted her"  Delvile grateful and enchanted now forgot his haste and his business and lost every wish but to reanimate her spirits she compelled him however to leave her that his visit might less be wondered at and sent by him a message to Mrs Delvile that wholly relying upon her wisdom she implicitly submitted to her decree  CHAP XI AN ENTERPRISE  CECILIA now had no time for afterthoughts or anxious repentance since notwithstanding the hurry of her spirits and the confusion of her mind she had too much real business to yield to pensive indulgence  Averse to all falsehood she invented none upon this occasion she merely told her guests she was summoned to London upon an affair of importance and though she saw their curiosity not being at liberty to satisfy it with the truth she attempted not to appease it by fiction but quietly left it to its common fare conjecture She would gladly have made Henrietta the companion of her journey but Henrietta was the last to whom that journey could give pleasure She only therefore took her maid in the chaise and attended by one servant on horseback at six o'clock the next morning she quitted her mansion to enter into an engagement by which soon she was to resign it for ever  Disinterested as she was she considered her situation as peculiarly perverse that from the time of her coming to a fortune which most others regarded as enviable she had been a stranger to peace a fruitless seeker of happiness a dupe to the fraudulent and a prey to the needy the little comfort she had received had been merely from dispensing it and now only had she any chance of being happy herself when upon the point of relinquishing what all others built their happiness upon obtaining  These reflections only gave way to others still more disagreeable she was now a second time engaged in a transaction she could not approve and suffering the whole peace of her future life to hang upon an action dark private and imprudent an action by which the liberal kindness of her late uncle would be annulled by which the father of her intended husband would be disobeyed and which already in a similar instance had brought her to affliction and disgrace These melancholy thoughts haunted her during the whole journey and though the assurance of Mrs Delvile's approbation was some relief to her uneasiness she involuntarily prepared herself for meeting new mortifications and was tormented  with an apprehension that this second attempt made her merit them  She drove immediately by the previous direction of Delvile to a lodginghouse in AlbemarleStreet which he had taken care to have prepared for her reception She then sent for a chair and went to Mrs Delvile's Her being seen by the servants of that house was not very important as their master was soon to be acquainted with the real motive of her journey  She was shewn into a parlour while Mrs Delvile was informed of her arrival and there flown to by Delvile with the most grateful eagerness Yet she saw in his countenance that all was not well and heard upon enquiry that his mother was considerably worse  Extremely shocked by this intelligence she already began to lament her unfortunate enterprise Delvile struggled by exerting his own spirits to restore her's but forced gaiety is never exhilarating and full of care and anxiety he was ill able to appear sprightly and easy  They were soon summoned up stairs into the apartment of Mrs Delvile who was lying upon a couch pale weak and much altered Delvile led the way saying  "Here madam comes one whose sight will bring peace and pleasure to you"  "This indeed"  cried Mrs Delvile half rising and embracing her  "is the form in which they are most welcome to me virtuous noble Cecilia what honour you do my son with what joy should I ever recover shall I assist him in paying the gratitude he owes you"  Cecilia grieved at her situation and affected by her kindness could only answer with her tears which however were not shed alone for Devile's eyes were full as he passionately exclaimed  "This this is the sight my heart has thus long desired the wife of my choice taken to the bosom of the parent I revere be yet but well my beloved mother and I will be thankful for every calamity that has led to so sweet a conclusion"  "Content yourself however my son with one of us"  cried Mrs Delvile smiling  "and content yourself if you can though your hard lot should make that one this creature of full bloom health and youth Ah my love"  added she more seriously and addressing the still weeping Cecilia  "should now Mortimer in losing me lose those cares by which alone for some months past my life has been rendered tolerable how peaceably shall I resign him to one so able to recompense his filial patience and services"  This was not a speech to stop the tears of Cecilia though such warmth of approbation quieted her conscientious scruples Delvile now earnestly interfered he told her that his mother had been ordered not to talk or exert herself and entreated her to be composed and his mother to be silent  "Be it  your  business then"  said Mrs Delvile more gaily  "to find us entertainment We will promise to be very still if you will take that trouble upon yourself"  "I will not"  answered he  "be rallied from my purpose if I cannot entertain it will be something to weary you for that may incline you to take rest which will be answering a better purpose"  "Mortimer"  returned she  "is this the ingenuity of duty or of love and which are you just now thinking of my health or a conversation uninterrupted with Miss Beverley"  "Perhaps a little of both"  said he chearfully though colouring  "But you rather meant it should pass"  said Mrs Delvile  "you were thinking only of me I have always observed that where one scheme answers two purposes the ostensive is never the purpose most at heart"  "Why it is but common prudence"  answered Delvile  "to feel our way a little  before we mention what we most wish and so cast the hazard of the refusal upon something rather less important"  "Admirably settled"  cried Mrs Delvile  "so my rest is but to prove Miss Beverley's disturbanceWell it is only anticipating our future way of life when her disturbance in taking the management of you to herself will of course prove my rest"  She then quietly reposed herself and Delvile discoursed with Cecilia upon their future plans hopes and actions  He meant to set off from the churchdoor to Delvile Castle to acquaint his father with his marriage and then to return instantly to London there he entreated Cecilia to stay with his mother that finding them both together he might not exhaust her patience by making his parting visit occasion another journey to Suffolk  But here Cecilia resolutely opposed him saying her only chance to escape discovery was going instantly to her own house and representing so earnestly her desire that their marriage should be unknown till his return to England upon a thousand motives of delicacy propriety and fearfulness that the obligation he owed already to a compliance which he saw grew more and more reluctant restrained him both in gratitude and  pity from persecuting her further Neither would she consent to seeing him in Suffolk which could but delay his mother's journey and expose her to unnecessary suspicions she promised however to write to him often and as from his mother's weakness he must travel very slowly she took a plan of his route and engaged that he should find a letter from her at every great town  The bond which he had already had altered he insisted upon leaving in her own custody averse to applying to Mr Monckton whose behaviour to him had before given him disgust and in whom Cecilia herself no longer wished to confide He had again applied to the same lawyer Mr Singleton to give her away for though to his secrecy he had no tie he had still less to any entire stranger Mrs Delvile was too ill to attend them to church nor would Delvile have desired from her such absolute defiance of his father  Cecilia now gave another sigh to her departed friend Mrs Charlton whose presence upon this awful occasion would else again have soothed and supported her She had no female friend in whom she could rely but feeling a repugnance invincible to being accompanied only by men she accepted the attendance of Mrs Delvile's own woman who had lived many  years in the family and was high in the favour and confidence of her lady  The arrangement of these and other articles with occasional interruptions from Mrs Delvile fully employed the evening Delvile would not trust again to meeting her at the church but begged her to send out her servants between seven and eight o'clock in the morning at which time he would himself call for her with a chair  She went away early that Mrs Delvile might go to rest and it was mutually agreed they should risk no meeting the next day Delvile conjured them to part with firmness and chearfulness and Cecilia fearing her own emotion would have retired without bidding her adieu But Mrs Delvile calling after her said  "Take with you my blessing"  and tenderly embracing her added  "My son as my chief nurse claims a prescriptive right to govern me but I will break from his control to tell my sweet Cecilia what ease and what delight she has already given to my mind my best hope of recovery is founded on the pleasure I anticipate in witnessing your mutual happiness but should my illness prove fatal and that felicity be denied me my greatest earthly care is already removed by the security I feel of Mortimer's future peace Take with you then my blessing  for you are become one to me long daughter of my affection now wife of my darling son love her Mortimer as she merits and cherish her with tenderest gratitudebanish sweetest Cecilia every apprehension that oppresses you and receive in Mortimer Delvile a husband that will revere your virtues and dignify your choice"  She then embraced her again and seeing that her heart was too full for speech suffered her to go without making any answer Delvile attended her to her chair scarce less moved than herself and found only opportunity to entreat her punctuality the next morning  She had indeed no inclination to fail in her appointment or risk the repetition of scenes so affecting or situations so alarming Mrs Delvile's full approbation somewhat restored to her her own but nothing could remove the fearful anxiety which still privately tormented her with expectations of another disappointment  The next morning she arose with the light and calling all her courage to her aid determined to consider this day as decisive of her destiny with regard to Delvile and rejoicing that at least all suspense would be over to support herself with fortitude be that destiny what it might  At the appointed time she sent her maid  to visit Mrs Hill and gave some errands to her man that carried him to a distant part of the town but she charged them both to return to the lodgings by nine o'clock at which hour she ordered a chaise for returning into the country  Delvile who was impatiently watching for their quitting the house only waited till they were out of sight to present himself at the door He was shewn into a parlour where she instantly attended him and being told that the clergyman Mr Singleton and Mrs Delvile's woman were already in the church she gave him her hand in silence and he led her to the chair  The calmness of stifled hope had now taken place in Cecilia of quick sensations and alarm Occupied with a firm belief she should never be the wife of Delvile she only waited with a desperate sort of patience to see when and by whom she was next to be parted from him  When they arrived near the church Delvile stopt the chair He handed Cecilia out of it and discharging the chairmen conducted her into the church He was surprised himself at her composure but earnestly wishing it to last took care not to say to her a word that should make any answer from her necessary  He gave her as before to Mr Singleton  secretly praying that not as before she might be given him in vain Mrs Delvile's woman attended her the clergyman was ready and they all proceeded to the altar  The ceremony was begun Cecilia rather mechanically than with consciousness appearing to listen to it but at the words  If any man can shew any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together  Delvile himself shook with terror lest some concealed person should again answer it and Cecilia with a sort of steady dismay in her countenance cast her eyes round the church with no other view than that of seeing from what corner the prohibiter would start  She looked however to no purpose no prohibiter appeared the ceremony was performed without any interruption and she received the thanks of Delvile and the congratulations of the little set before the idea which had so strongly preoccupied her imagination was sufficiently removed from it to satisfy her she was really married  They then went to the vestry where their business was not long and Delvile again put Cecilia into a chair which again he accompanied on foot  Her sensibility now soon returned though still attended with strangeness and a sensation  of incredulity But the sight of Delvile at her lodgings contrary to their agreement wholly recovered her senses from the stupor which had dulled them He came however but to acknowledge how highly she had obliged him to see her himself restored to the animation natural to her character and to give her a million of charges resulting from anxiety and tenderness And then fearing the return of her servants he quitted her and set out for Delvile Castle  The amazement of Cecilia was still unconquerable to be actually united with Delvile to be his with the full consent of his motherto have him her's beyond the power of his fathershe could not reconcile it with possibility she fancied it a dreambut a dream from which she wished not to awake  BOOK X  CHAP I A DISCOVERY  CECILIA's journey back to the country was as safe and free from interruption as her journey had been to town and all that distinguished them was what passed in her own mind the doubts apprehensions and desponding suspense which had accompanied her setting out were now all removed and certainty ease the expectation of happiness and the cessation of all perplexity had taken their place She had nothing left to dread but the inflexibility of Mr Delvile and hardly any thing even to hope but the recovery of his lady  Her friends at her return expressed their wonder at her expedition but their wonder at what occasioned it though still greater met no satisfaction Henrietta rejoiced in her sight though her absence had been so  short and Cecilia whose affection with her pity increased intimated to her the event for which she wished her to prepare herself and frankly acknowledged she had reason to expect it would soon take place  Henrietta endeavoured with composure to receive this intelligence and to return such a mark of confidence with chearful congratulations but her fortitude was unequal to an effort so heroic and her character was too simple to assume a greatness she felt not she sighed and changed colour and hastily quitted the room that she might sob aloud in another  Warmhearted tender and susceptible her affections were all undisguised struck with the elegance of Delvile and enchanted by his services to her brother she had lost to him her heart at first without missing it and when missed without seeking to reclaim it The hopelessness of such a passion she never considered nor asked herself its end or scarce suspected its aim it was pleasant to her at the time and she looked not to the future but fed it with visionary schemes and soothed it with voluntary fancies Now she knew all was over she felt the folly she had committed but though sensibly and candidly angry at her own error its conviction offered nothing but sorrow to succeed it  The felicity of Cecilia whom she loved admired and revered she wished with the genuine ardour of zealous sincerity but that Delvile the very cause and sole subject of her own personal unhappiness should himself constitute that felicity was too much for her spirits and seemed to her mortified mind too cruel in her destiny  Cecilia who in the very vehemence of her sorrow saw its innocence was too just and too noble to be offended by it or impute to the bad passions of envy or jealousy the artless regret of an untutored mind To be penetrated too deeply with the merit of Delvile with her wanted no excuse and she grieved for her situation with but little mixture of blame and none of surprise She redoubled her kindness and caresses with the hope of consoling her but ventured to trust her no further till reflection and her natural good sense should better enable her to bear an explanation  Nor was this friendly exertion any longer a hardship to her the sudden removal in her own feelings and affairs of distress and expectation had now so much lightened her heart that she could spare without repining some portion of its spirit to her dejected young friend  But an incident happened two mornings after which called back and most unpleasantly  her attention to herself She was told that Mrs Matt the poor woman she had settled in Bury begged an audience and upon sending for her up stairs and desiring to know what she could do for her  "Nothing madam just now"  she answered  "for I don't come upon my own business but to tell some news to you madam You bid me never take notice of the wedding that was to be and I'm sure I never opened my mouth about it from that time to this but I have found out who it was put a stop to it and so I come to tell you"  Cecilia extremely amazed eagerly desired her to go on  "Why madam I don't know the gentlewoman's name quite right yet but I can tell you where she lives for I knew her as soon as I set eyes on her when I see her at church last Sunday and I would have followed her home but she went into a coach and I could not walk fast enough but I asked one of the footmen where she lived and he said at the great house at the Grove and perhaps madam you may know where that is and then he told me her name but that I can't just now think of"  "Good heaven"  cried Cecilia  "it could not be Bennet"  "Yes ma'am that's the very name I know it again now I hear it"  Cecilia then hastily dismissed her first desiring her not to mention the circumstance to any body  Shocked and dismayed she now saw but saw with horror the removal of all her doubts and the explanation of all her difficulties in the full and irrefragable discovery of the perfidy of her oldest friend and confident  Miss Bennet herself she regarded in the affair as a mere tool which though in effect it did the work was innocent of its mischief because powerless but in the hand of its employer  "That employer"  cried she  "must be Mr Monckton Mr Monckton whom so long I have known who so willingly has been my counsellor so ably my instructor in whose integrity I have confided upon whose friendship I have relied my succour in all emergencies my guide in all perplexitiesMr  Monckton  thus dishonourably thus barbarously to betray me to turn against me the very confidence I had reposed in his regard for me and make use of my own trust to furnish the means to injure me"  She was now wholly confirmed that he had wronged her with Mr Delvile she could not have two enemies so malignant without provocation and he who so unfeelingly could dissolve a union at the very  altar could alone have the baseness to calumniate her so cruelly  Evil thoughts thus awakened stopt not merely upon facts conjecture carried her further and conjecture built upon probability The officiousness of Morrice in pursuing her to London his visiting her when there and his following and watching Delvile she now reasonably concluded were actions directed by Mr Monckton whose house he had but just left and whose orders whatever they might be she was almost certain he would obey Availing himself therefore of the forwardness and suppleness which met in this young man she doubted not but his intelligence had contributed to acquaint him with her proceedings  The motivof such deep concerted and accummulated treachery was next to be sought nor was the search long one only could have tempted him to schemes so hazardous and costly and unsuspicious as she was she now saw into his whole design  Long accustomed to regard him as a safe and disinterested old friend the respect with which as a child she had looked up to him she had insensibly preserved when a woman That respect had taught her to consider his notice as a favour and far from suspiciously shunning she had innocently courted it  and his readiness in advising and tutoring her his frank and easy friendliness of behaviour had kept his influence unimpaired by preventing its secret purpose from being detected  But now the whole mystery was revealed his aversion to the Delviles to which hitherto she had attributed all she disapproved in his behaviour she was convinced must be inadequate to stimulate him to such lengths That aversion itself was by this late surmise accounted for and no sooner did it occur to her than a thousand circumstances confirmed it  The first among these was the evident ill will of Lady Margaret which though she had constantly imputed to the general irascibility for which her character was notorious she had often wondered to find impenetrable to all endeavours to please or soften her His care of her fortune his exhortations against her expences his wish to make her live with Mr Briggs all contributed to point out the selfishness of his attentions which in one instance rendered visible became obvious in every other  Yet various as were the incidents that now poured upon her memory to his disgrace not one among them took its rise from his behaviour to herself which always had been scrupulously circumspect or if for  a moment unguarded only at a season when her own distress or confusion had prevented her from perceiving it This recollection almost staggered her suspicions yet so absolute seemed the confirmation they received from every other that her doubt was overpowered and soon wholly extinguished  She was yet ruminating upon this subject when word was brought her that Mr Monckton was in the parlour  Mingled disgust and indignation made her shudder at his name and without pausing a moment she sent him word she was engaged and could not possibly leave her room  Astonished by such a dismission he left the house in the utmost confusion But Cecilia could not endure to see him after a discovery of such hypocrisy and villainy  She considered however that the matter could not rest here he would demand an explanation and perhaps by his unparalleled address again contrive to seem innocent notwithstanding appearances were at present so much against him Expecting therefore some artifice and determined not to be duped by it she sent again for the Pewopener to examine her more strictly  The woman was out at work in a private family and could not come till the evening but when further questioned the description  she gave of Miss Bennet was too exact to be disputed  She then desired her to call again the next morning and sent a servant to the Grove with her compliments to Miss Bennet and a request that she might send her carriage for her the next day at any time she pleased as she wished much to speak with her  This message she was aware might create some suspicion and put her upon her guard but she thought nevertheless a sudden meeting with the Pewopener whom she meant abruptly to confront with her would baffle the security of any previously settled scheme  To a conviction such as this even Mr Monckton must submit and since he was lost to her as a friend she might at least save herself the pain of keeping up his acquaintance  CHAP II AN INTERVIEW  THE servant did not return till it was dark and then with a look of much dismay said he had been able to meet with nobody who could either give or take a message that the Grove was all in confusion and the whole country in an uproar for Mr Monckton just as he arrived had been brought home dead  Cecilia screamed with involuntary horror a pang like remorse seized her mind with the apprehension she had some share in this catastrophe and innocent as she was either of his fall or his crimes she no sooner heard he was no more than she forgot he had offended her and reproached herself with severity for the shame to which she meant to expose him the next morning  Dreadfully disturbed by this horrible incident she entreated Mrs Harrel and Henrietta to sup by themselves and going into her own room determined to write the whole affair to Delvile in a letter she should direct to be left at the postoffice for him at Margate  And here strongly she felt the happiness of being actually his wife she could now without reserve make him acquainted with all her affairs and tell to the master of her heart every emotion that entered it  While engaged in this office the very action of which quieted her a letter was brought her from Delvile himself She received it with gratitude and opened it with joy he had promised to write soon but  so  soon she had thought impossible  The reading took not much time the letter contained but the following words  To Miss BEVERLEY  My CECILIA  Be alone I conjure you dismiss every body and admit me this moment  Great was her astonishment at this note no name to it no conclusion the characters indistinct the writing crooked the words so few and those few scarce legible  He desired to see her and to see her alone she could not hesitate in her compliancebut whom could she dismissher servants if ordered away would but be curiously upon the watchshe could think  of no expedient she was all hurry and amazement  She asked if any one waited for an answer The footman said no that the note was given in by somebody who did not speak and who ran out of sight the moment he had delivered it  She could not doubt this was Delvile himselfDelvile who should now be just returned from the castle to his mother and whom she had thought not even a letter would reach if directed any where nearer than Margate  All she could devise in obedience to him was to go and wait for him alone in her dressingroom giving orders that if any one called they might be immediately brought up to her as she expected somebody upon business with whom she must not be interrupted  This was extremely disagreeable to her yet contrary as it was to their agreement she felt no inclination to reproach Delvile the abruptness of his note the evident handshaking with which it had been written the strangeness of the request in a situation such as theirsall concurred to assure her he came not to her idly and all led her to apprehend he came to her with evil tidings  What they might be she had no time to  conjecture a servant in a few minutes opened the dressingroom door and said  "Ma'am a gentleman"  and Delvile abruptly entering shut it himself in his eagerness to get rid of him  At his sight her prognostication of ill became stronger she went forward to meet him and he advanced to her smiling and in haste but that smile did not well do its office it concealed not a pallid countenance in which every feature spoke horror it disguised not an aching heart which almost visibly throbbed with intolerable emotion Yet he addressed her in terms of tenderness and peace but his tremulous voice counteracted his words and spoke that all within was tumult and war  Cecilia amazed affrighted had no power to hasten an explanation which on his own part he seemed unable or fearful to begin He talked to her of his happiness in again seeing her before he left the kingdom entreated her to write to him continually said the same thing two and three times in a breath began with one subject and seemed unconscious he wandered presently into another and asked her questions innumerable about her health journey affairs and ease of mind without hearing from her any answer or seeming to miss that she made none  Cecilia grew dreadfully terrified something strange and most alarming she was sure must have happened but  what  she had no means to know nor courage nor even words to enquire  Delvile at length the first hurry of his spirits abating became more coherent and considerate and looking anxiously at her said  "Why this silence my Cecilia"  "I know not"  said she endeavouring to recover herself  "but your coming was unexpected I was just writing to you at Margate"  "Write still then but direct to Ostend I shall be quicker than the post and I would not lose a lettera linea word from you for all the world can offer me"  "Quicker than the post"  cried Cecilia  "but how can Mrs Delvile"  she stopt not knowing what she might venture to ask  "She is now on the road to Margate I hope to be there to receive her I mean but to bid you adieu and be gone"  Cecilia made no answer she was more and more astonished more and more confounded  "You are thoughtful"  said he with tenderness  "are you unhappysweetest Cecilia most excellent of human creatures if I have made you unhappyand I mustit is inevitable"  "Oh Delvile"  cried she now assuming more courage  "why will you not speak to me openlysomething I see is wrong may I not hear it may I not tell you at least my concern that any thing has distressed you"  "You are too good"  cried he  "to deserve you is not possiblebut to afflict you is inhuman"  "Why so"  cried she more chearfully  "must I not share the common lot or expect the whole world to be new modelled lest I should meet in it any thing but happiness"  "There is not indeed much danger Have you pen and ink here"  She brought them to him immediately with paper  "You have been writing to me you sayI will begin a letter myself"  "To me"  cried she  He made no answer but took up the pen and wrote a few words and then flinging it down said  "FoolI could have done this without coming"  "May I look at it"  said she and finding he made no opposition advanced and read  I fear to alarm you by rash precipitationI fear to alarm you by lingering suspensebut all is not well  "Fear nothing"  cried she turning to him with the kindest earnestness  "tell me whatever it may beAm I not your wife bound by every tie divine and human to share in all your sorrows if unhappily I cannot mitigate them"  "Since you allow me"  cried he gratefully  "so sweet a claim a claim to which all others yield and which if you repent not giving me will make all others nearly immaterial to meI will own to you that all indeed is not well I have been hastyyou will blame me I deserve indeed to be blamedentrusted with your peace and happiness to suffer rage resentment violence to make me forego what I owed to such a depositeIf your blame however stops short of repentancebut it cannot"  "What then"  cried she with warmth  "must you have done for there is not an action of which I believe you capable there is not an event which I believe to be possible that can ever make me repent belonging to you wholly"  "Generous condescending Cecilia"  cried he  "Words such as these hung there not upon me an evil the most depressing would be almost more than I could bearwould make me too blest for mortality"  "But words such as these"  said she  more gaily  "I might long have coquettedere I had spoken had you not drawn them from me by this alarm Take therefore the good with the ill and remember if all does not go right you have now a trusty friend as willing to be the partner of your serious as your happiest hours"  "Shew but as much firmness as you have shewn sweetness"  cried he  "and I will fear to tell you nothing"  She reiterated her assurances they then both sat down and he began his account  "Immediately from your lodgings I went where I had ordered a chaise and stopt only to change horses till I reached Delvile Castle My father saw me with surprise and received me with coldness I was compelled by my situation to be abrupt and told him I came before I accompanied my mother abroad to make him acquainted with an affair which I thought myself bound in duty and respect to suffer no one to communicate to him but myself He then sternly interrupted me and declared in high terms that if this affair concerned  you  he would not listen to it I attempted to remonstrate upon this injustice when he passionately broke forth into new and horrible charges against you affirming that he had them from authority as indisputable as  ocular demonstration I was then certain of some foul play"  "Foul play indeed"  cried Cecilia who now knew but too well by whom she had been injured  "Good heaven how have I been deceived where most I have trusted"  "I told him"  continued Delvile  "some gross imposition had been practiced upon him and earnestly conjured him no longer to conceal from me by whom This unfortunately encreased his rage imposition he said was not so easily played upon him he left that for  me  who so readily was duped while for himself he had only given credit to a man of much consideration in Suffolk who had known you from a child who had solemnly assured him he had repeatedly endeavoured to reclaim you who had rescued you from the hands of Jews at his own hazard and loss and who actually shewed him bonds acknowledging immense debts which were signed with your own hand"  "Horrible"  exclaimed Cecilia  "I believed not such guilt and perfidy possible"  "I was scarce myself"  resumed Delvile  "while I heard him I demanded even with fierceness his author whom I scrupled not to execrate as he deserved he coldly answered he was bound by an oath never to reveal him nor should he repay his honourable  attention to his family by a breach of his own word were it even less formally engaged I then lost all patience to mention honour I cried was a farce where such infamous calumnies were listened tobut let me not shock you unnecessarily you may readily conjecture what passed"  "Ah me"  cried Cecilia  "you have then quarrelled with your father"  "I have"  said he  "nor does he yet know I am married in so much wrath there was no room for narration I only pledged myself by all I held sacred never to rest till I had cleared your fame by the detection of this villainy and then left him without further explanation"  "Oh return then to him directly"  cried Cecilia  "he is your father you are bound to bear with his displeasurealas had you never known me you had never incurred it"  "Believe me"  he answered  "I am ill at ease under it if you wish it when you have heard me I will go to him immediately if not I will write and you shall yourself dictate what"  Cecilia thanked him and begged he would continue his account  "My first step when I left the Castle was to send a letter to my mother in which I entreated her to set out as soon as possible  for Margate as I was detained from her unavoidably and was unwilling my delay should either retard our journey or oblige her to travel faster At Margate I hoped to be as soon as herself if not before her"  "And why"  cried Cecilia  "did you not go to town as you had promised and accompany her"  "I had business another way I came hither"  "Directly"  "Nobut soon"  "Where did you go first"  "My Cecilia it is now you must summon your fortitude I left my father without an explanation on  my  partbut not till in his rage of asserting his authority he had unwarily named his informant"  "Well"  "That informantthe most deceitful of menwas your long pretended friend Mr Monckton"  "So I feared"  said Cecilia whose blood now ran cold through her veins with sudden and new apprehensions  "I rode to the Grove on hackhorses and on a full gallop the whole way I got to him early in the evening I was shewn into his library I told him my errandYou look pale my love You are not well"  Cecilia too sick for speech leant he head upon a table Delvile was going to call for help but she put her hand upon his arm to stop him and perceiving she was only mentally affected he rested and endeavoured by every possible means to revive her  After a while she again raised her head faintly saying  "I am sorry I interrupted you but the conclusion I already knowMr Monckton is dead"  "Not dead"  cried he"  "dangerously indeed wounded but thank heaven not actually dead"  "Not dead"  cried Cecilia with recruited strength and spirits  "Oh then all yet may be wellif he is not dead he may recover"  "He may I hope he will"  "Now then"  she cried  "tell me all I can bear any intelligence but of death by human means"  "I meant not to have gone such lengths far from it I hold duels in abhorrence as unjustifiable acts of violence and savage devices of revenge I have offended against my own convictionbut transported with passion at his infamous charges I was not master of my reason I accused him of his perfidy he denied it I told him I had it from my fatherhe changed the subject to  pour abuse upon him I insisted on a recantation to clear you he asked by what right I fiercely answered by a husband's His countenance then explained at least the motives of his treacheryhe loves you himself he had probably schemed to keep you free till his wife died and then concluded his machinations would secure you his own For this purpose finding he was in danger of losing you he was content even to blast your character rather than suffer you to escape him But the moment I acknowledged my marriage he grew more furious than myself and in shortfor why relate the frenzies of rage we walked out together my travelling pistols were already charged I gave him his choice of them and the challenge being mine for insolence joined with guilt had robbed me of all forbearance he fired first but missed me I then demanded whether he would clear your fame he called out  "Fire I will make no terms"  I did fireand unfortunately aimed better We had neither of us any second all was the result of immediate passion but I soon got people to him and assisted in conveying him home He was at first believed to be dead and I was seized by his servants but he afterwards shewed signs of life and by sending for my friend Biddulph I was released Such is  the melancholy transaction I came to relate to you flattering myself it would something less shock you from me than from another yet my own real concern for the affair the repentance with which from the moment the wretch fell I was struck in being his destroyer and the sorrow the remorse rather which I felt in coming to wound you with such black such fearful intelligenceyou to whom all I owe is peace and comfortthese thoughts gave me so much disturbance that in fact I knew less than any other how to prepare you for such a tale"  He stopt but Cecilia could say nothing to censure him now would both be cruel and vain yet to pretend she was satisfied with his conduct would be doing violence to her judgment and veracity She saw too that his error had sprung wholly from a generous ardor in her defence and that his connfidence in her character had resisted without wavering every attack that menaced it For this she felt truly grateful yet his quarrel with his fatherthe danger of his motherhis necessary absenceher own clandestine situationand more than all the threatened death of Mr Monckton by his hands were circumstances so full of dread and sadness she knew  not upon which to speakhow to offer him comforthow to assume a countenance that looked able to receive any or by what means to repress the emotions which so many ways assailed her Delvile having vainly waited some reply then in a tone the most melancholy said  "If it is yet possible you can be sufficiently interested in my fate to care what becomes of me aid me now with your counsel or rather with your instructions I am scarce able to think for myself and to be thought for by you would yet be a consolation that would give me spirit for any thing"  Cecilia starting from her reverie repeated  "To care what becomes of you Oh Delvilemake not my heart bleed by words of such unkindness"  "Forgive me"  cried he  I meant not a reproach I meant but to state my own consciousness how little I deserve from you You talked to me of going to my father do you still wish it"  "I think so"  cried she too much disturbed to know what she said yet fearing again to hurt him by making him wait her answer  "I will go then"  said he  "without doubt too happy to be guided by you whichever way I steer I have now indeed  much to tell him but whatever may be his wrath there is little fear at this time that my own temper cannot bear it what next shall I do"  "What next"  repeated she  "indeed I know not"  "Shall I go immediately to Margate or shall I first ride hither"  "If you please"  said she much perturbed and deeply sighing  "I please nothing but by your direction to follow that is my only chance of pleasure Which then shall I doyou will not now refuse to direct me"  "No certainly not for the world"  "Speak to me then my love and tell mewhy are you thus silentis it painful to you to counsel me"  "No indeed"  said she putting her hand to her head  "I will speak to you in a few minutes"  "Oh my Cecilia"  cried he looking at her with much alarm  "call back your recollection you know not what you say you take no interest in what you answer"  "Indeed I do"  said she sighing deeply and oppressed beyond the power of thinking beyond any power but an internal consciousness of wretchedness  "Sigh not so bitterly"  cried he  "if you have any compassion sigh not so bitterlyI cannot bear to hear you"  "I am very sorry indeed"  said she fighing again and not seeming sensible she spoke  "Good Heaven"  cried he rising  "distract me not with this horrorspeak not to me in such broken sentencesDo you hear me Ceciliawhy will you not answer me"  She started and trembled looked pale and affrighted and putting both her hands upon her heart said  "Oh yesbut I have an oppression herea tightness a fulnessI have not room for breath"  "Oh beloved of my heart"  cried he wildly casting himself at her feet  "kill me not with this terrorcall back your facultiesawake from this dreadful insensibility tell me at least you know metell me I have not tortured you quite to madnesssole darling of my affections my own my wedded Ceciliarescue me from this agony it is more than I can support"  This energy of distress brought back her scattered senses scarce more stunned by the shock of all this misery than by the restraint of her feelings in  struggling to conceal it But these passionate exclamations restoring her sensibility she burst into tears which happily relieved her mind from the conflict with which it was labouring and which not thus effected might have ended more fatally  Never had Delvile more rejoiced in her smiles than now in these seasonable tears which he regarded and blest as the preservers of her reason They flowed long without any intermission his soothing and tenderness but melting her to more sorrow after a while however the return of her faculties which at first seemed all consigned over to grief was manifested by the returning strength of her mind she blamed herself severely for the little fortitude she had shewn but having now given vent to emotions too forcible to be wholly stifled she assured him he might depend upon her better courage for the future and entreated him to consider and settle his affairs  Not speedily however could Delvile himself recover The torture he had suffered in believing though only for a few moments that the terror he had given to Cecilia had affected her intellects made even a deeper impression upon his imagination than the scene of fury and death which had occasioned that terror and Cecilia who  now strained every nerve to repair by her firmness the pain which by her weakness she had given him was sooner in a condition for reasoning and deliberation than himself  "Ah Delvile"  she cried comprehending what passed within him  "do you allow nothing for surprize and nothing for the hard conflict of endeavouring to suppress it do you think me still as unfit to advise with and as worthless as feeble a counsellor as during the first confusion of my mind"  "Hurry not your tender spirits I beseech you"  cried he  "we have time enough we will talk about business by and by"  "What time"  cried she  "what is it now o'clock"  "Good Heaven"  cried he looking at his watch  "already past ten you must turn me out my Cecilia or calumny will still be busy even though poor Monckton is quiet"  "I  will  turn you out"  cried she  "I am indeed most earnest to have you gone But tell me your plan and which way you mean to go"  "That"  he answered  "you shall decide for me yourself whether to Delvile Castle to finish one tale and wholly communicate  another or to Margate to hasten my mother abroad before the news of this calamity reaches her"  "Go to Margate"  cried she eagerly  "set off this very moment you can write to your father from Ostend But continue I conjure you on the continent till we see if this unhappy man lives and enquire of those who can judge what must follow if he should not"  "A trial"  said he  "must follow and it will go I fear but hardly with me the challenge was mine his servants can all witness I went to him not he to meOh my Cecilia the rashness of which I have been guilty is so opposite to my principles and all generous as is your silence I know it so opposite to yours that never should his blood be on my hands wretch as he was never will my heart be quiet more"  "He will live he will live"  cried Cecilia repressing her horror  "fear nothing for he will liveand as to his wound and his sufferings his perfidy has deserved them Go then to Margate think only of Mrs Devile and save her if possible from hearing what has happened"  "I will gostaydo which and whatever you bid me but should what I fear come to pass should my mother continue  ill my father inflexible should this wretched man die and should England no longer be a country I shall love to dwell incould you then bear to ownwould you then consent to follow me"  "Could Iam I not yours may you not command me tell me thenyou have only to sayshall I accompany you at once"  Delvile affected by her generosity could scarce utter his thanks yet he did not hesitate in denying to avail himself of it  "No my Cecilia"  he cried  "I am not so selfish If we have not happier days we will at least wait for more desperate necessity With the uncertainty if I have not this man's life to answer for at the hazard of my own to take my wifemy bridefrom the kingdom I must flyto make her a fugitive and an exile in the first publishing that she is mine No if I am not a destined alien for life I can never permit it Nothing less believe me shall ever urge my consent to wound the chaste propriety of your character by making you an eloper with a duelist"  They then again consulted upon their future plans and concluded that in the present disordered state of their affairs it would be best not to acknowledge even to  Mr Delvile their mariage to whom the news of the duel and Mr Monckton's danger would be a blow so severe that to add to it any other might half distract him  To the few people already acquainted with it Delvile therefore determined to write from Ostend reurging his entreaties for their discretion and secresy Cecilia promised every post to acquaint him how Mr Monckton went on and she then besought him to go instantly that he might outtravel the ill news to his mother  He complied and took leave of her in the tenderest manner conjuring her to support her spirits and be careful of her health  "Happiness"  said he  "is much in arrears with us and though my violence may have frightened it away your sweetness and gentleness will yet attract it back all that for me is in store must be received at your handswhat is offered in any other way I shall only mistake for evil droop not therefore my generous Cecilia but in yourself preserve me"  "I will not droop"  said she  "you will find I hope you have not intrusted yourself in ill hands"  "Peace then be with you my lovemy comforting my soulreviving Cecilia Peace such as angels give and such as may  drive from your mind the remembrance of this bitter hour"  He then tore himself away  Cecilia who to his blessings could almost like the tender Belvidera have exclaimed  O do not leave mestay with me and curse me  listened to his steps till she could hear them no longer as if the remaining moments of her life were to be measured by them but then remembering the danger both to herself and him of his stay she endeavoured to rejoice that he was gone and but that her mind was in no state for joy was too rational not to have succeeded  Grief and horror for what was past apprehension and suspense for what was to come so disordered her whole frame so confused even her intellects that when not all the assistance of fancy could persuade her she still heard the footsteps of Delvile she went to the chair upon which he had been seated and taking possession of it sat with her arms crossed silent quiet and erect almost vacant of all thought yet with a secret idea she was doing something right  Here she continued till Henrietta came to wish her good night whose surprise  and concern at the strangeness of her look and attitude once more recovered her But terrified herself at this threatened wandering of her reason and certain she must all night be a stranger to rest she accepted the affectionate offer of the kindhearted girl to stay with her who was too much grieved for her grief to sleep any more than herself  She told her not what had passed that she knew would be fruitless affliction to her but she was soothed by her gentleness and her conversation was some security from the dangerous rambling of her ideas  Henrietta herself found no little consolation in her own private sorrows that she was able to give comfort to her beloved Miss Beverley from whom she had received favours and kind offices innumerable she quitted her not night nor day and in the honest pride of a little power to shew the gratefulness of her heart she felt a pleasure and selfconsequence she had never before experienced  CHAP III A SUMMONS  CECILIA's earliest care almost at break of day was to send to the Grove from thence she heard nothing but evil Mr Monckton was still alive but with little or no hope of recovery constantly delirious and talking of Miss Beverley and of her being married to young Delvile  Cecilia who knew well this at least was no delirium though shocked that he talked of it hoped his danger less than was apprehended  The next day however more fatal news was brought her though not from the quarter she expected it Mr Monckton in one of his raving fits had sent for Lady Margaret to his bed side and used her almost inhumanly he had railed at her age and infirmities with incredible fury called her the cause of all his sufferings and accused her as the immediate agent of Lucifer in his present wound and danger Lady  Margaret whom neither jealousy nor malignity had cured of loving him was dismayed and affrighted and in hurrying out of the room upon his attempting in his frenzy to strike her she dropt down dead in an apoplectic fit  "Good Heaven thought Cecilia what an exemplary punishment has this man he looses his hated wife at the very moment when her death could no longer answer his purposes Poor Lady Margaret her life has been as bitter as her temper married from a view of interest ill used as a bar to happiness and destroyed from the fruitless ravings of despair"  She wrote all this intelligence to Ostend whence she received a letter from Delvile acquainting her he was detained from proceeding further by the weakness and illness of his mother whose sufferings from seasickness had almost put an end to her existence  Thus passed a miserable week Monckton still merely alive Delvile detained at Ostend and Cecilia tortured alike by what was recently passed actually present and fearfully expected when one morning she was told a gentleman upon business desired immediately to speak with her  She hastily obeyed the summons the  constant image of her own mind Delvile being already present to her and a thousand wild conjectures upon what had brought him back rapidly occurring to her  Her expectations however were ill answered for she found an entire stranger an elderly man of no pleasant aspect or manners  She desired to know his business  "I presume madam you are the lady of this house"  She bowed an assent  "May I take the liberty madam to ask your name"  "My name sir"  "You will do me a favour madam by telling it me"  "Is it possible you are come hither without already knowing it"  "I know it only by common report madam"  "Common report sir I believe is seldom wrong in a matter where to be right is so easy"  "Have you any objection madam to telling me your name"  "No sir but your business can hardly be very important if you are yet to learn whom you are to address It will be time enough therefore for us to meet when you are elsewhere satisfied in this point"  She would then have left the room  "I beg madam"  cried the stranger  "you will have patience it is necessary before I can open my business that I should hear your name from yourself"  "Well sir"  cried she with some hesitation  "you can scarce have come to this house without knowing that its owner is Cecilia Beverley"  "That madam is your maiden name"  "My maiden name"  cried she starting  "Are you not married madam"  "Married sir"  she repeated while her cheeks were the colour of scarlet  "It is properly therefore madam the name of your husband that I mean to ask"  "And by what authority sir"  cried she equally astonished and offended  "do you make these extraordinary enquiries"  "I am deputed madam to wait upon you by Mr Eggleston the next heir to this estate by your uncle's will if you die without children or change your name when you marry His authority of enquiry madam I presume you will allow and he has vested it in me by a letter of attorney"  Cecilia's distress and confusion were now unspeakable she knew not what to own or deny she could not conjecture how she had been betrayed and she had never made the smallest preparation against such an attack  "Mr Eggleston"  madam he continued  "has been pretty credibly informed that you are actually married he is very desirous therefore to know what are your intentions for your continuing to be called  Miss  Beverley as if still single leaves him quite in the dark but as he is so deeply concerned in the affair he expects as a lady of honour you will deal with him without prevarication"  "This demand sir"  said Cecilia stammering  "is so extremelysoso little expected"  "The way madam in these cases is to keep pretty closely to the point are you married or are you not"  Cecilia quite confounded made no answer to disavow her marriage when thus formally called upon was every way unjustifiable to acknowledge it in her present situation would involve her in difficulties innumerable  "This is not madam a slight thing Mr Eggleston has a large family and a small  fortune and that into the bargain very much encumbered it cannot therefore be expected that he will knowingly connive at cheating himself by submitting to your being actually married and still enjoying your estate though your husband does not take your name"  Cecilia now summoning more presence of mind answered  "Mr Eggleston sir has at least nothing to fear from imposition those with whom he has or may have any transactions in this affair are not accustomed to practice it"  "I am far from meaning any offence madam my commission from Mr Eggleston is simply this to beg you will satisfy him upon what grounds you now evade the will of your late uncle which till cleared up appears a point manifestly to his prejudice"  "Tell him then sir that whatever he wishes to know shall be explained to him in about a week At present I can give no other answer"  "Very well madam he will wait that time I am sure for he does not wish to put you to any inconvenience But when he heard the gentleman was gone abroad without owning his marriage he thought it high time to take some notice of the matter"  Cecilia who by this speech found she was every way discovered was again in the utmost confusion and with much trepidation said  "since you seem so well sir acquainted with this affair I should be glad you would inform me by what means you came to the knowledge of it"  "I heard it madam from Mr Eggleston himself who has long known it"  "Long sirimpossible when it is not yet a forrnightnot ten days or no more that"  She stopt recollecting she was making a confession better deferred  "That madam"  he answered  "may perhaps bear a little contention for when this business comes to be settled it will be very essential to be exact as to the time even to the very hour for a large income per annum divides into a small one per diem and if your husband keeps his own name you must not only give up your uncle's inheritance from the time of relinquishing yours but refund from the very day of your marriage"  "There is not the least doubt of it"  answered she  "nor will the smallest difficulty be made"  "You will please then to recollect madam that this sum is every hour encreasing  and has been since last September which made half a year accountable for last March Since then there is now added"  "Good Heaven sir"  cried Cecilia  "what calculation are you making out do you call last week last September"  "No madam but I call last September the month in which you were married"  "You will find yourself then sir extremely mistaken and Mr Eggleston is preparing himself for much disapointment if he supposes me so long in arrears with him"  "Mr Eggleston madam happens to be well informed of this transaction as if there is any dispute in it you will find He was your immediate successor in the house to which you went last September in in PallMall the woman who kept it acquainted his servants that the last lady who hired it stayed with her but a day and only came to town she found to be married and hearing upon enquiry this lady was Miss Beverley the servants well knowing that their master was her conditional heir old him the circumstance"  "You will find all this sir end in nothing"  "That madam as I said before remains  to be proved If a young lady at eight o'clock in the morning is seenand she was seen going into a church with a young gentleman and one female friend and is afterwards observed to come out of it followed by a clergyman and another person supposed to have officiated as father and is seen get into a coach with same young gentleman and same female friend why the circumstancs are pretty strong"  "They may seem so sir but all conclusions drawn from them will be erroneous I was not married then upon my honour"  "We have little madam to do with professions the circumstances are strong enough to bear a trial and"  "A trial"  "We have traced madam many witnesses able to stand to divers particulars and eight months share of such an estate as this is well worth a little trouble"  "I am amazed sir surely Mr Eggleston never desired you to make use of this language to me"  "Mr Eggleston madam has behaved very honourably though he knew the whole affair so long ago he was persuaded Mr Delvile had private reasons for a short concealment  and expecting every day when they would be cleared up by his taking your name he never interfered but being now informed he set out last week for the continent he has been advised by his friends to claim his rights"  "That claim sir he need not fear will be satisfied and without any occasion for threats of enquiries or law suits"  "The truth madam is this Mr Eggleston is at present in a little difficulty about some money matters which makes it a point with him of some consequence to have the affair settled speedily unless you could conveniently compromise the matter by advancing a particular sum till it suits you to refund the whole that is due to him and quit the premises"  "Nothing sir is due to him at least nothing worth mentioning I shall enter into no terms for I have no compromise to make As to the premises I will quit them with all the expedition in my power"  "You will do well madam for the truth is it will not be convenient to him to wait much longer"  He then went away  "When next"  cried Cecilia  "shall I again be weak vain blind enough to  form any plan with a hope of secresy or enter with  any  hope into a clandestine scheme betrayed by those I have trusted discovered by those I have not thought of exposed to the cruellest alarms and defenceless from the most shocking attacksSuch has been the life I have led since the moment I first consented to a private engagementAh Delvile your mother in her tenderness forgot her dignity or she would not have concurred in an action which to such disgrace made me liable"  CHAP IV A DELIBERATION  IT was necessary however not to moralize but to act Cecilia had undertaken to give her answer in a week and the artful attorney had drawn from her an acknowledgement of her situation by which he might claim it yet sooner  The lawsuit with which she was threatened for the arrears of eight months alarmed her not though it shocked her as she was certain she could prove her marriage so much later  It was easy to perceive that this man had been sent with a view of working from her a confession and terrifying from her some money the confession indeed in conscience and honesty she could not wholly elude but she had suffered too often by a facility in parting with money to be there easily duped  Nothing however was more true than that she now lived upon an estate of which she no longer was the owner and that all she either spent or received was to be accounted  for and returned since by the will of her uncle unless her husband took her name her estate on the very day of her marriage was to be forfeited and entered upon by the Egglestons Delvile's plan and hope of secresy had made them little weigh this matter though this premature discovery so unexpectedly exposed her to their power  The first thought that occurred to her was to send an express to Delvile and desire his instructions how to proceed but she dreaded his impetuosity of temper and was almost certain that the instant he should hear she was in any uneasiness or perplexity he would return to her at all hazards even though Mr Monckton were dead and his mother herself dying This step therefore she did not dare risk preferring any personal hardship to endangering the already precarious life of Mrs Delvile or to hastening her son home while Mr Monckton was in so desperate a situation  But though what to avoid was easy to settle what to seek was difficult to devise She had now no Mrs Charlton to receive her nor a creature in whom she could confide To continue her present way of living was deeply involving Delvile in debt a circumstance she had never considered in the confusion and hurry attending all  their plans and conversations and a circumstance which though to him it might have occurred he could not in common delicacy mention  Yet to have quitted her house and retrenched her expences would have raised suspicions that must have anticipated the discovery she so much wished to have delayed That wish by the present danger of its failure was but more ardent to have her affairs and situation become publicly known at the present period she felt would half distract herPrivately married parted from her husband at the very moment of their union a husband by whose hand the apparent friend of her earliest youth was all but killed whose father had execrated the match whose mother was now falling a sacrifice to the vehemence with which she had opposed it and who himself little short of an exile knew not yet if with personal safety he might return to his native land  To circumstances so dreadful she had now the additional shock of being uncertain whether her own house might not be seized before any other could be prepared for her reception  Yet still whither to go what to do or what to resolve she was wholly unable to  determine and after meditating almost to madness in the search of some plan or expedient she was obliged to give over the attempt and be satisfied with remaining quietly where she was till she had better news from Delvile of his mother or better news to send him of Mr Monckton carefully mean time in all her letters avoiding to alarm him by any hint of her distress  Yet was she not idle either from despair or helplessness she found her difficulties encreased and she called forth more resolution to combat them she animated herself by the promise she had made Delvile and recovering from the sadness to which she had at first given way she now exerted herself with vigour to perform it as she ought  She began by making an immediate inspection into her affairs and endeavouring where expence seemed unnecessary to lessen it She gave Henrietta to understand she feared they must soon part and so afflicted was the unhappy girl at the news that she found it the most cruel office she had to execute The same intimation she gave to Mrs Harrel who repined at it more openly but with a selfishness so evident that it blunted the edge of pity She then announced to Albany her inability to pursue at present their extensive schemes  of benevolence and though he instantly left her to carry on his laborious plan elsewhere the reverence she had now excited in him of her character made him leave her with no sensation but of regret and readily promise to return when her affairs were settled or her mind more composed  These little preparations which were all she could make with enquiries after Mr Monckon and writing to Delvile sufficiently filled up her time though her thoughts were by no means confined to them Day after day passed and Mr Monckton continued to linger rather than live the letters of Delvile still only dated from Ostend contained the most melancholy complaints of the illness of his mother and the time advanced when her answer would be claimed by the attorney  The thought of such another visit was almost intolerable and within two days of the time that she expected it she resolved to endeavour herself to prevail with Mr Eggleston to wait longer  Mr Eggleston was a gentleman whom she knew little more than by sight he was no relation to her family nor had any connection with the Dean but by being a cousin to a lady he had married and who had left him no children The dean had no particular regard for him and had rather  mentioned him in his will as the successor of Cecilia in case she died unmarried or changed her name as a mark that he approved of her doing neither than as a matter he thought probable if even possible to turn out in his favour  He was a man of a large family the sons of which who were extravagant and dissipated had much impaired his fortune by prevailing with him to pay their debts and much distressed him in his affairs by successfully teasing him for money  Cecilia acquainted with these circumstances knew but too well with what avidity her estate would be seized by them and how little the sons would endure delay even if the father consented to it Yet since the sacrifice to which she had agreed must soon make it indisputably their own she determined to deal with them openly and acknowledged therefore in her letter her marriage without disguise but begged their patience and secresy and promised in a short time the most honourable retribution and satisfaction  She sent this letter by a man and horse Mr Eggleston's habitation being within fifteen miles of her own  The answer was from his eldest son who acquainted her that his father was very ill and had put all his affairs into the hands of  Mr Carn his attorney who was a man of great credit and would see justice done on all sides  If this answer which she broke open the instant she took it into her hand was in itself a cruel disappointment to her how was that disappointment embittered by shame and terror when upon again folding it up she saw it was directed to Mrs Mortimer Delvile  This was a decisive stroke what they wrote to her she was sure they would mention to all others she saw they were too impatient for her estate to be moved by any representations to a delay and that their eagerness to publish their right took from them all consideration of what they might make her suffer Mr Eggleston she found permitted himself to be wholly governed by his son his son was a needy and profligate spendthrift and by throwing the management of the affair into the hands of an attorney craftily meant to shield himself from the future resentment of Delvile to whom hereafter he might affect at his convenience to disapprove Mr Carn's behaviour while Mr Carn was always secure by averring he only exerted himself for the interest of his client  The discerning Cecilia though but little experienced in business and wholly unsuspicious  by nature yet saw into this management and doubted not these excuses were already arranged She had only therefore to save herself an actual ejectment by quitting a house in which she was exposed to such a disgrace  But still whither to go she knew not One only attempt seemed in her power for an honourable asylum and that was more irksomely painful to her than seeking shelter in the meanest retreat it was applying to Mr Delvile senior  The action of leaving her house whether quietly or forcibly could not but instantly authenticate the reports spread by the Egglestons of her marriage to hope therefore for secresy any longer would be folly and Mr Delvile's rage at such intelligence might be still greater to hear it by chance than from herself She now lamented that Delvile had not at once told the tale little foreseeing such a discovery as the present they had mutually concluded to defer the communication till his return  Her own anger at the contemptuous ill treatment she had repeatedly met from him she was now content not merely to suppress but to dismiss since as the wife of his son without his consent she considered herself no longer as wholly innocent of incurring it Yet such was her dread of his austerity  and the arrogance of his reproaches that by choice she would have preferred an habitation with her own pensioner the pewopener to the grandest apartment in Delvile Castle while he continued its lord  In her present situation however her choice was little to be consulted the honour of Delvile was concerned in her escaping even temporary disgrace and nothing she knew would so much gratify him as any attention from her to his father She wrote to him therefore the following letter which she sent by an express  TO the Hon COMPTON DELVILE  SIR  APRIL th  I should not even by letter presume thus to force myself upon your remembrance did I not think it a duty I now owe your son both to risk and to bear the displeasure it may unhappily occasion After such an acknowledgment all other confession would be superfluous and uncertain as I am if you will ever deign to own me more words than are necessary would be merely impertinent  It was the intention of your son Sir when he left the kingdom to submit wholly  to your arbitration at his return which should be resigned his own name or my fortune but his request for your decision and his supplication for your forgiveness are both most unfortunately prevented by a premature and unforeseen discovery of our situation which renders an immediate determination absolutely unavoidable  At this distance from him I cannot in time receive his directions upon the measures I have to take pardon me then Sir if well knowing my reference to him will not be more implicit than his own to you I venture in the present important crisis of my affairs to entreat those commands instantly by which I am certain of being guided ultimately  I would commend myself to your favour but that I dread exciting your resentment I will detain you therefore only to add that the father of Mr Mortimer Devile will ever meet the most profound respect from her who without his permission dares sign no name to the honour she now has in declaring herself  his most humble and most obedient servant  Her mind was somewhat easier when this letter was written because she thought it a duty yet felt reluctance in performing it  She wished to have represented to him strongly the danger of Delvile's hearing her distress but she knew so well his inordinate selfsufficiency she feared a hint of that sort might be construed into an insult and concluded her only chance that he would do any thing was by leaving wholly to his own suggestions the weighing and settling what  But though nothing was more uncertain than whether she should be received at Delvile Castle nothing was more fixed than that she must quit her own house since the pride of Mr Delvile left not even a chance that his interest would conquer it She deferred not therefore any longer making preparations for her removal though wholly unsettled whither  Her first which was also her most painful task was to acquaint Henrietta with her situation she sent therefore to desire to speak with her but the countenance of Henrietta shewed her communication would not surprise her  "What is the matter with my dear Henrietta"  cried Cecilia  "who is it has already afflicted that kind heart which I am now compelled to afflict for myself"  Henrietta in whom anger appeared to be struggling with sorrow answered  "No  madam not afflicted for  you  it would be strange if I were thinking as I think"  "I am glad"  said Cecilia calmly  "if you are not "for I would give to you were it possible nothing but pleasure and joy"  "Ah madam"  cried Henrietta bursting into tears  "why will you say so when you don't care what becomes of me when you are going to cast me offand when you will soon be too happy ever to think of me more"  "If I am never happy till then"  said Cecilia  "sad indeed will be my life no my gentlest friend you will always have your share in my heart and always to me would have been the welcomest guest in my house but for those unhappy circumstances which make our separating inevitable"  "Yet you suffered me madam to hear from any body that you was married and going away and all the common servants in the house knew it before me"  "I am amazed"  said Cecilia  "how and which way can they have heard it"  "The man that went to Mr Eggleston brought the first news of it for he said all the servants there talked of nothing else and that their master was to come and take possession here next Thursday"  Cecilia started at this most unwelcome intelligence  "Yet you envy me"  she cried  "Henrietta though I am forced from my house though in quitting it I am unprovided with any other and though him for whom I relinquish it is far off without means of protecting or power of returning to me"  "But you are married to him madam"  cried she expressively  "True my love but also I am parted from him"  "Oh how differently"  exclaimed Henrietta  "do the great think from the little were  I  marriedand  so  married I should want neither house nor fine cloaths nor riches nor any thingI should not care where I livedevery place would be paradise I would walk to him barefoot if he were a thousand miles off and I should mind nobody else in the world while I had him to take care of me"  Ah Delvile thought Cecilia what powers of fascination are yours should I be tempted to repine at what I have to bear I will think of this heroick girl and blush  Mrs Harrel now broke in upon them eager to be informed of the truth or falsehood of the reports which were buzzed  throughout the house Cecilia briefly related to them both the state of her affairs earnestly expressing her concern at the abrupt separation which must take place and for which she had been unable to prepare them as the circumstances which led to it had been wholly unforeseen by herself  Mrs Harrel listened to the account with much curiosity and surprize but Henrietta wept incessantly in hearing it the object of a passion ardent as it was romantic lost to her past recovery torn herself probably for ever from the best friend she had in the world and obliged to return thus suddenly to an home she detestedHenrietta possessed not the fortitude to hear evils such as these which to her inexperienced heart appeared the severest that could be inflicted  This conversation over Cecilia sent for her Steward and desired him with the utmost expedition to call in all her bills and instantly to go round to her tenants within twenty miles and gather in from those who were able to pay the arrears now due to her charging him however upon no account to be urgent with such as seemed distressed  The bills she had to pay were collected  without difficulty she never owed much and creditors are seldom hard of access but the money she hoped to receive fell very short of her expectations for the indulgence she had shewn to her tenants had ill prepared them for so sudden a demand  CHAP V A DECISION  THIS business effectually occupied the present and following day the third Cecilia expected her answer from Delvile Castle and the visit she so much dreaded from the attorney  The answer arrived first  To Miss BEVERLEY  Madam  As my son has never apprized me of the extraordinary step which your letter intimates I am too unwilling to believe him capable of so far forgetting what he owes his family to ratify any such intimation by interfering with my counsel or opinion  I am Madam c COMPTON DELVILE  DELVILECASTLE  May st  Cecilia had little right to be surprised by this letter and she had not a moment to  comment upon it before the attorney arrived  "Well madam"  said the man as he entered the parlour  "Mr Eggleston has stayed your own time very patiently he commissions me now to enquire if it is convenient to you to quit the premises"  "No Sir it is by no means convenient to me and if Mr Eggleston will wait some time longer I shall be greatly obliged to him"  "No doubt madam but he will upon proper considerations"  "What Sir do you call proper"  "Upon your advancing to him as I hinted before an immediate particular sum from what must by and bye be legally restituted"  "If this is the condition of his courtesy I will quit the house without giving him further trouble"  "Just as it suits you madam He will be glad to take possession tomorrow or next day"  "You did well Sir to commend his patience I shall however merely discharge my servants and settle my accounts and be ready to make way for him"  "You will not take it amiss madam if I remind you that the account with Mr Eggleston must be the first that is settled"  "If you mean the arrears of this last fortnight or three weeks I believe I must desire him to wait Mr Delvile's return as I may otherwise myself be distressed for ready money"  "That madam is not likely as it is well known you have a fortune that was independent of your late uncle and as to distress for ready money it is a plea Mr Eggleston can urge much more strongly"  "This is being strangely hasty Sirso short a time as it is since Mr Eggleston could expect  any  part of this estate"  "That madam is nothing to the purpose from the moment it is his he has as many wants for it as any other gentleman He desired me however to acquaint you that if you still chose an apartment in this house till Mr Delvile returns you shall have one at your service"  "To be a  guest  in this house Sir"  said Cecilia drily  "might perhaps seem strange to me I will not therefore be so much in his way"  Mr Cran then informed her she might put her seal upon whatever she meant hereafter to claim or dispute and took his leave  Cecilia now shut herself up in her own room to meditate without interruption before she would proceed to any action  She felt much inclination to send instantly for some lawyer but when she considered her peculiar situation the absence of her husband the renunciation of his father the loss of her fortune and her ignorance upon the subject she thought it better to rest quiet till Delvile's own fate and own opinion could be known than to involve herself in a lawsuit she was so little able to superintend  In this cruel perplexity of her mind and her affairs her first thought was to board again with Mrs Bayley but that was soon given up for she felt a repugnance unconquerable to continuing in her native county when deprived of her fortune and cast out of her dwelling Her situation indeed was singularly unhappy since by this unforeseen vicissitude of fortune she was suddenly from being an object of envy and admiration sunk into distress and threatened with disgrace from being every where caressed and by every voice praised she blushed to be seen and expected to be censured and from being generally regarded as an example of happiness and a model of virtue she was now in one moment to appear to the world an outcast from her own house yet received into no other a bride unclaimed by a  husband an HEIRESS dispossessed of all wealth  To be first acknowledged as  Mrs Delvile  in a state so degrading she could not endure and to escape from it one way alone remained which was going instantly abroad  Upon this therefore she finally determined her former objections to such a step being now wholly though unpleasantly removed since she had neither estate nor affairs to demand her stay and since all hopes of concealment were totally at an end Her marriage therefore and its disgraceful consequences being published to the world she resolved without delay to seek the only asylum which was proper for her in the protection of the husband for whom she had given up every other  She purposed therefore to go immediately and privately to London whence she could best settle her route for the continent where she hoped to arrive before the news of her distress reached Delvile whom nothing she was certain but her own presence could keep there for a moment after hearing it  Thus decided at length in her plan she proceeded to put it in execution with calmness and intrepidity comforting herself that the conveniencies and indulgencies  with which she was now parting would soon be restored to her and though not with equal power with far more satisfaction She told her steward her design of going the next morning to London bid him pay instantly all her debts and discharge all her servants determining to keep no account open but that with Mr Eggleston which he had made so intricate by double and undue demands that she thought it most prudent and safe to leave him wholly to Delvile  She then packed up all her papers and letters and ordered her maid to pack up her clothes  She next put her own seal upon her cabinets draws and many other things and employed almost all her servants at once in making complete inventories of what every room contained  She advised Mrs Harrel to send without delay for Mr Arnott and return to his house She had first purposed to carry Henrietta home to her mother herself but another scheme for her now occurred from which she hoped much future advantage to the amiable and dejected girl  She knew well that deep as was at present her despondency the removal of all possibility of hope by her knowledge of Delvile's marriage must awaken her before  long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy Mr Arnott himself was in a situation exactly similar and the knowledge of the same event would probably be productive of the same effect When Mrs Harrel therefore began to repine at the solitude to which she was returning Cecilia proposed to her the society of Henrietta which glad to catch at any thing that would break into her loneliness she listened to with pleasure and seconded by an invitation  Henrietta to whom all houses appeared preferable to her own home joyfully accepted the offer committing to Cecilia the communication of the change of her abode to Mrs Belfield  Cecilia who in the known and tried honour of Mr Arnott would unreluctantly have trusted a sister was much pleased by this little arrangement from which should no good ensue no evil at least was probable But she hoped through the mutual pity their mutual melancholy might inspire that their minds already not dissimilar would be softened in favour of each other and that in conclusion each might be happy in receiving the consolation each could give and a union would take place in which their reciprocal disappointment might in time be nearly forgotten  There was not indeed much promise of such an event in the countenance of Mr Arnott when late at night he came for his sister nor in the unbounded sorrow of Henrietta when the moment of leavetaking arrived Mr Arnott looked half dead with the shock his sister's intelligence had given him and Henrietta's heart torn asunder between friendship and love was scarce able to bear a parting which from Cecilia she regarded as eternal added to the consciousness it was occasioned by her going to join Delvile for life  Cecilia who both read and pitied these conflicting emotions was herself extremely hurt by this necessary separation She tenderly loved Henrietta she loved her even the more for the sympathy of their affections which called forth the most forcible commiserationthat which springs from fellow feeling  "Farewell"  she cried  "my Henrietta be but happy as you are innocent and be both as I love you and nothing will your friends have to wish for you or yourself to regret"  "I must always regret"  cried the sobbing Henrietta  "that I cannot live with you for ever I should regret it if I were queen of all the world how much more then when I am nothing and nobody I  do not wish  you  happy madam for I think happiness was made on purpose for you and nobody else ever had it before I only wish you health and long life for the sake of those who will be made as happy as youfor you will spoil themas you have spoilt mefrom being ever happy without you"  Cecilia reiterated her assurances of a most faithful regard embraced Mrs Harrel spoke words of kindness to the drooping Mr Arnott and then parted with them all  Having still many small matters to settle and neither company nor appetite she would eat no supper but in passing thro' the hall in her way to her own room she was much surprised to see all her domestics assembled in a body She stopt to enquire their intention when they eagerly pressed forward humbly and earnestly entreating to know why they were discharged  "For no reason in the world"  cried Cecilia  "but because it is at present out of my power to keep you any longer"  "Dont part with  me  madam for that"  cried one of them  "for I will serve you for nothing"  "So will I"  cried another  "And I"  "And I"  was echoed by them all while  "no other such mistress is to be found"  "We can never bear any other place"  and  "keep  me  madam at least"  was even clamorously urged by each of them  Cecilia distressed and slattered at once by their unwillingness to quit her received this testimony of gratitude for the kind and liberal treatment they had received with the warmest thanks both for their services and fidelity and assured them that when again she was settled all those who should be yet unprovided with places should be preferred in her house before any other claimants  Having with difficulty broken from them she sent for her own man Ralph who had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean and told him she meant still to continue him in her service The man heard it with great delight and promised to redouble his deligence to deserve her favour She then communicated the same news to her maid who had also resided with her some years and by whom with the same or more pleasure it was heard  These and other regulations employed her almost all night yet late and fatigued as she went to bed she could not close her eyes fearful something was left undone she robbed herself of the short time she had allowed to rest by incessant meditation  upon what yet remained to be executed She could recollect however one only thing that had escaped her vigilance which was acquainting the pewopener and two or three other poor women who had weekly pensions from her that they must at least for the present depend no longer upon her assistance  Nothing indeed could be more painful to her than giving them such information yet not to be speedy with it would double the barbarity of their disappointment She even felt for these poor women whose loss in her she knew would be irreparable a compassion that drove from her mind almost every other subject and determined her in order to soften to them this misfortune to communicate it herself that she might prevent their from sinking under it by reviving them with hopes of her future assistance  She had ordered at seven o'clock in the morning an hired chaise at the door and she did not suffer it long to wait for her She quitted her house with a heart full of care and anxiety grieving at the necessity of making such a sacrifice uncertain how it would turn out and labouring under a thousand perplexities with respect to the measures she ought immediately to take She passed when she reached the hall  through a row of weeping domestics not one of whom with dry eyes could see the house bereft of such a mistress She spoke to them all with kindness and as much as was in her power with chearfulness but the tone of her voice gave them little reason to think the concern at this journey was all their own  She ordered her chaise to drive round to the pewopener's and thence to the rest of her immediate dependents She soon however regretted that she had given herself this task the affliction of these poor pensioners was clamorous was almost heartbreaking they could live they said no longer they were ruined for ever they should soon be without bread to eat and they might cry for help in vain when their generous their only benefactress was far away  Cecilia made the kindest efforts to comfort and encourage them assuring them the very moment her own affairs were arranged she would remember them all visit them herself and contribute to their relief with all the power she should have left Nothing however could console them they clung about her almost took the horses from the chaise and conjured her not to desert those who were solely cherished by her bounty  Nor was this all she had to suffer the news of her intention to quit the county was now reported throughout the neighbourhood and had spread the utmost consternation among the poor in general and the lower class of her own tenants in particular and the road was soon lined with women and children wringing their hands and crying They followed her carriage with supplications that she would return to them mixing blessings with their lamentations and prayers for her happiness with the bitterest repinings at their own loss  Cecilia was extremely affected her liberal and everready hand was every other instant involuntarily seeking her purse which her many immediate expences made her prudence as often check and now first she felt the capital error she had committed in living constantly to the utmost extent of her income without ever preparing though so able to have done it against any unfortunate contingency  When she escaped at last from receiving any longer this painful tribute to her benevolence she gave orders to her man to ride forward and stop at the Grove that a precise and minute account of Mr Monckton might be the last as it was now become the most important news she should hear in Suffolk This he did when to her  equal surprise and delight she heard that he was suddenly so much better there were hopes of his recovery  Intelligence so joyful made her amends for almost every thing yet she hesitated not in her plan of going abroad as she knew not where to be in England and could not endure to hurry Delvile from his sick mother by acquainting him with her helpless and distressed situation But so revived were her spirits by these unexpected tidings that a gleam of brightest hope once more danced before her eyes and she felt herself invigorated with fresh courage and new strength sufficient to support her through all hardships and fatigues  Spirits and courage were indeed much wanted for the enterprize she had formed but little used to travelling and having never been out of England she knew nothing of the route but by a general knowledge of geography which though it could guide her east or west could teach her nothing of foreign customs the preparations necessary for the journey the impositions she should guard against nor the various dangers to which she might be exposed from total ignorance of the country through which she had to pass  Conscious of these deficiencies for such an undertaking she deliberated without intermission  how to obviate them Yet sometimes when to these hazards those arising from her youth and sex were added she was upon the point of relinquishing her scheme as too perilous for execution and resolving to continue privately in London till some change happened in her affairs  But though to every thing she could suggest doubts and difficulties arose she had no friend to consult nor could devise any means by which they might be terminated Her maid was her only companion and Ralph who had spent almost his whole life in Suffolk her only guard and attendant To hire immediately some French servant used to travelling in his own country seemed the first step she had to take and so essential that no other appeared feasible till it was done But where to hear of such a man she could not tell and to take one not well recommended would be exposing herself to frauds and dangers innumerable  Yet so slow as Delvile travelled from whom her last letter was still dated Ostend she thought herself almost certain could she once reach the continent of overtaking him in his route within a day or two of her landing  The earnest inclination with which this scheme was seconded made her every moment  less willing to forego it It seemed the only harbour for her after the storm she had weathered and the only refuge she could properly seek while thus houseless and helpless Even were Delvile in England he had no place at present to offer her nor could any thing be proposed so unexceptionable as her living with Mrs Delvile at Nice till he knew his father's pleasure and in a separate journey home had arranged his affairs either for her return or her continuance abroad  With what regret did she now look back to the time when in a distress such as this she should have applied for and received the advice of Mr Monckton as oracular The loss of a counsellor so long so implicitly relied upon lost to her also only by his own interested worthlessness she felt almost daily for almost daily some intricacy or embarrassment made her miss his assistance and though glad since she found him so undeserving that she had escaped the snares he had spread for her she grieved much that she knew no man of honest character and equal abilities that would care for her sufficiently to supply his place in her confidence  As she was situated at present she could think only of Mr Belfield to whom she could apply for any advice Nor even to  him was the application unexceptionable the calumnies of Mr Delvile senior making it disagreeable to her even to see him But he was at once a man of the world and a man of honour he was the friend of Mortimer whose confidence in him was great and his own behaviour had uniformly shewn a respect far removed from impertinence or vanity and a mind superior to being led to them by the influence of his gross mother She had indeed when she last quitted his house determined never to reenter it but determinations hasty or violent are rarely observed because rarely practicable she had promised Henrietta to inform Mrs Belfield whither she was gone and reconcile her to the absence she still hoped to make from home She concluded therefore to go to PortlandStreet without delay and enquire openly and at once whether and when she might speak with Mr Belfield resolving if tormented again by any forward insinuations to rectify all mistakes by acknowledging her marriage  She gave directions accordingly to the postboy and Ralph  With respect to her own lodgings while in town as money was no longer unimportant to her she meant from the Befields to go to the Hills by whom she might be recommended to some reputable and cheap  place To the Belfields however though very late when she arrived in town she went first unwilling to lose a moment in promoting her scheme of going abroad  She left her maid in the chaise and sent Ralph on to Mrs Hill with directions to endeavour immediately to procure her a lodging  CHAP VI A PRATING  CECILIA was shewn into a parlour where Mrs Belfield was very earnestly discoursing with Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins and Belfield himself to her great satisfaction was already there and reading  "Lackaday"  cried Mrs Belfield  "if one does not always see the people one's talking of Why it was but this morning madam I was saying to Mr Hobson I wonder says I a young lady of such fortunes as Miss Beverley should mope herself up so in the country Don't you remember it Mr Hobson"  "Yes madam"  answered Mr Hobson  "but I think for my part the young lady's quite in the right to do as she's a mind for that's what I call living agreeable and if I was a young lady tomorrow with such fine fortunes and that it's just what I should do myself for what I say is this where's the joy of having a little money and being a little matter above the world if one has not one's own will"  "Ma'am"  said Mr Simkins who had scarce yet raised his head from the profoundness of his bow upon Cecilia's entrance into  the room  "if I may be so free may I make bold just for to offer you this chair"  "I called madam"  said Cecilia seizing the first moment in her power to speak  "in order to acquaint you that your daughter who is perfectly well has made a little change in her situation which she was anxious you should hear from myself"  "Ha ha stolen a match upon you I warrant"  cried the facetious Mr Hobson  "a good example for you young lady and if you take my advice you won't be long before you follow it for as to a lady let her be worth never so much she's a mere nobody as one may say till she can get herself a husband being she knows nothing of business and is made to pay for every thing through the nose"  "Fie Mr Hobson fie"  said Mr Simkins  "to talk so slighting of the ladies before their faces what one says in a corner is quite of another nature but for to talk so rude in their companyI thought you would scorn to do such a thing"  "Sir I don't want to be rude no more than yourself"  said Mr Hobson  "for what I say is rudeness is a thing that makes nobody agreeable but I don't see because of that why a man is not to speak his mind to a lady as well as to a gentleman provided he does it in a complaisant fashion"  "Mr Hobson"  cried Mrs Belfield very impatiently  "you might as well let  me  speak when the matter is all about my own daughter"  "I ask pardon ma'am"  said he  "I did not mean to stop you for as to not letting a lady speak one might as well tell a man in business not to look at the Daily Advertiser why its morally impossible"  "But sure madam"  cried Mrs Belfield  "it's no such thing You can't have got her off already"  I would I had thought Cecilia who then explained her meaning but in talking of Mrs Harrel avoided all mention of Mr Arnott well foreseeing that to hear such a man existed and was in the same house with her daughter would be sufficient authority to her sanguine expectations for depending upon a union between them and reporting it among her friends  This circumstance being made clear Cecilia added  "I could by no means have consented voluntarily to parting so soon with Miss Belfield but that my own affairs call me at present out of the kingdom"  And then addressing herself to Belfield she enquired if he could recommend to her a trusty foreign servant who would be hired only for the time she was to spend abroad  While Belfield was endeavouring to recollect  some such person Mr Hobson eagerly called out  "As to going abroad madam to be sure you're to do as you like for that as I say is the soul of every thing but else I can't say it's a thing I much approve for my notion is this here's a fine fortune got as a man may say out of the bowels of one's mother country and this fine fortune in default of male issue is obliged to come to a female the law making no proviso to the contrary Well this female going into a strange country naturally takes with her this fortune by reason it's the main article she has to depend upon what's the upshot why she gets pilfered by a set of sharpers that never saw England in their lives and that never lose sight of her till she has not a sous in the world But the hardship of the thing is this when it's all gone the lady can come back but will the money come backNo you'll never see it again now this is what I call being no true patriot"  "I am quite ashamed for to hear you talk so Mr Hobson"  cried Mr Simkins affecting to whisper  "to go for to take a person to task at this rate is behaving quite unbearable it's enough to make the young lady afraid to speak before you"  "Why Mr Simkins"  answered Mr Hobson  "Truth is truth whether one speaks it or not and that ma'am I dare  say a young lady of your good sense knows as well as myself"  "I think madam"  said Belfield who waited their silence with great impatience  "that I know just such a man as you will require and one upon whose honesty I believe you may rely"  "That's more"  said Mr Hobson  "than I would take upon me to say for any  Englishman  where you may meet with such a  Frenchman  I won't be bold to say"  "Why indeed"  said Mr Simkins  "if I might take the liberty for to put in though I don't mean in no shape to go to contradicting the young gentleman but if I was to make bold to speak my private opinion upon the head I should be inclinable for to say that as to putting a dependance upon the French it's a thing quite dubious how it may turn out"  "I take it as a great favour ma'am"  said Mrs Belfield  "that you have been so complaisant as to make me this visit tonight for I was almost afraid you would not have done me the favour any more for to be sure when you was here last things went a little unlucky but I had no notion for my part who the old gentleman was till after he was gone when Mr Hobson told me it was old Mr Delvile though sure enough I thought it rather upon the  extraordinary order that he should come here into my parlour and make such a secret of his name on purpose to ask me questions about my own son"  "Why I think indeed if I may be so free"  said Mr Simkins  "it was rather petickeler of the gentleman for to be sure if he was so over curious to hear about your private concerns the genteel thing if I may take the liberty for to differ would have been for him to say ma'am says he I'm come to ask the favour of you just to let me a little into your son's goings on and any thing ma'am you should take a fancy for to ask me upon the return why I shall be very compliable ma'am says he to giving of you satisfaction"  "I dare say"  answered Mrs Belfield  "he would not have said so much if you'd have gone down on your knees to ask him Why he was upon the very point of being quite in a passion because I only asked him his name though what harm that could do him I'm sure I never could guess However as he was so mighty inquisitive about my son if I had but known who he was in time I should have made no scruple in the world to ask him if he could not have spoke a few words for him to some of those great people that could have done him some good But the thing that I believe put him  so out of humour was my being so unlucky as to say before ever I knew who he was that I had heard he was not over and above goodnatured for I saw he did not seem much to like it at the time"  "If he had done the generous thing"  said Mr Simkins  "it would have been for him to have made the proffer of his services of his own freewill and it's rather surpriseable to me he should never have thought of it for what could be so natural as for him to say I see ma'am says he you've got a very likely young gentleman here that's a little out of cash says he so I suppose ma'am says he a place or a pension or something in that shape of life would be no bad compliment says he"  "But no such good luck as that will come to my share"  cried Mrs Belfield  "I can tell you that for every thing I want to do goes quite contrary Who would not have thought such a son as mine though I say it before his face could not have made his fortune long ago living as he did among all the great folks and dining at their table just like one of themselves yet for all that you see they let him go on his own way and think of him no more than of nobody I'm sure they might be ashamed to shew their faces and so I should tell them at once if I could but get sight of them"  "I don't mean ma'am"  said Mr Simkins  "for to be finding fault with what you say for I would not be unpelite in no shape but if I might be so free as for to differ a little bit I must needs say I am rather for going to work in anotherguess sort of a manner and if I was as you"  "Mr Simkins"  interrupted Belfield  "we will settle this matter another time"  And then turning to the wearied Cecilia  "The man madam"  he said  "whom I have done myself the honour to recommend to you I can see tomorrow morning may I then tell him to wait upon you"  "I ask pardon for just putting in"  cried Mr Simkins before Cecilia could answer and again bowing down to the ground  "but I only mean to say I had no thought for to be impertinent for as to what I was a going to remark it was not of no consequence in the least"  "Its a great piece of luck ma'am"  said Mrs Belfield  "that you should happen to come here of a holiday If my son had not been at home I should have been ready to cry for a week and you might come any day the year through but a Sunday and not meet with him any more than if he had never a home to come to"  "If Mr Belfield's homevisits are so periodical"  said Cecilia  "it must be rather  less than more difficult to meet with him"  "Why you know ma'am"  answered Mrs Belfield  "to day is a redletter day so that's the reason of it"  "A redletter day"  "Good lack madam why have not you heard that my son is turned bookkeeper"  Cecilia much surprised looked at Belfield who colouring very high and apparently much provoked by his mother's loquacity said  "Had Miss Beverley not heard it even now madam I should probably have lost with her no credit"  "You can surely lose none Sir"  answered Cecilia  "by an employment too little pleasant to have been undertaken from any but the most laudable motives"  "It is not madam the employment"  said he  "for which I so much blush as for the person employedfor  myself  In the beginning of the winter you left me just engaged in another business a business with which I was madly delighted and fully persuaded I should be enchanted for evernow again in the beginning of the summeryou find me already in a new occupation"  "I am sorry"  said Cecilia  "but far indeed from surprised that you found yourself  deceived by such sanguine expectations"  "Deceived"  cried he with energy  "I was bewitched I was infatuated common sense was estranged by the seduction of a chimera my understanding was in a ferment from the ebullition of my imagination But when this new way of life lost its noveltynovelty that shortliv'd but exquisite bliss no sooner caught than it vanishes no sooner tasted than it is gone which charms but to fly and comes but to destroy what it leaves behindwhen that was lost reason cool heartless reason took its place and teaching me to wonder at the frenzy of my folly brought me back to the tamenessthe sadness of reality"  "I am sure"  cried Mrs Belfield  "whatever it has brought you back to it has brought you back to no good it's a hard case you must needs think madam to a mother to see a son that might do whatever he would if he'd only set about it contenting himself with doing nothing but scribble and scribe one day and when he gets tired of that thinking of nothing better than casting up two and two"  "Why madam"  said Mr Hobson  "what I have seen of the world is this there's nothing methodizes a man but business  If he's never so much upon the stilts that's always a sure way to bring him down by reason he soon finds there's nothing to be got by rhodomontading Let every man be his own carver but what I say is them gentlemen that are what one may call geniuses commonly think nothing of the main chance till they get a tap on the shoulder with a writ and a solid lad that knows three times five is fifteen will get the better of them in the long run But as to arguing with gentlemen of that sort where's the good of it You can never bring them to the point say what you will all you can get from them is a farrago of fine words that you can't understand without a dictionary"  "I am inclinable to think"  said Mr Simkins  "that the young gentleman is rather of opinion to like pleasure better than business and to be sure it's very excusable of him because its more agreeabler And I must needs say if I may be so free I'm partly of the young gentleman's mind for business is a deal more trouble"  "I hope however"  said Cecilia to Belfield  "your present situation is less irksome to you"  "Any situation madam must be less irksome than that which I quitted to write by rule to compose by necessity to make  the understanding nature's first gift subservient to interest that meanest offspring of artwhen weary listless spiritless to rack the head for invention the memory for images and the fancy for ornament and allusion and when the mind is wholly occupied by its own affections and affairs to call forth all its faculties for foreign subjects uninteresting discussions or fictitious incidentsHeavens what a life of struggle between the head and the heart how cruel how unnatural a war between the intellects and the feelings"  "As to these sort of things"  said Mr Hobson  "I can't say I am much versed in them by reason they are things I never much studied but if I was to speak my notion it is this the best way to thrive in the world is to get money but how is it to be got Why by business for business is to money what fine words are to a lady a sure road to success Now I don't mean by this to be censorious upon the ladies being they have nothing else to go by for as to examining if a man knows any thing of the world and that they have nothing whereby to judge knowing nothing of it themselves So that when they are taken in by rogues and sharpers the fault is all in the law for making no proviso against their having money in their own hands Let  every one be trusted according to their headpiece and what I say is this a lady in them cases is much to be pitied for she is obligated to take a man upon his own credit which is tantamount to no credit at all being what man will speak an ill word of himself you may as well expect a bad shilling to cry out don't take me That's what I say and that's my way of giving my vote"  Cecilia quite tired of these interruptions and impatient to be gone now said to Belfield  "I should be much obliged to you Sir if you could send to me the man you speak of tomorrow morning I wished also to consult you with regard to the route I ought to take My purpose is to go to Nice and as I am very desirous to travel expeditiously you may perhaps be able to instruct me what is the best method for me to pursue"  "Come Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins"  cried Mrs Belfield with a look of much significance and delight  "suppose you two and I was to walk into the next room There's no need for us to hear all the young lady may have a mind to say"  "She has nothing to say madam"  cried Cecilia  "that the whole world may not hear Neither is it my purpose to talk but to listen if Mr Belfield is at leisure to favour me with his advice"  "I must always be at leisure and always be proud madam"  Belfield began when Hobson interrupting him said  "I ask pardon Sir for intruding but I only mean to wish the young lady good night As to interfering with business that's not my way for it's not the right method by reason"  "We will listen to your reason Sir"  cried Belfield  "some other time at present we will give you all credit for it unheard"  "Let every man speak his own maxim Sir"  cried Hobson  "for that's what I call fair arguing but as to one person's speaking and then making an answer for another into the bargain why it's going to work nohow you may as well talk to a counter and think because you make a noise upon it with your own hand it gives you the reply"  "Why Mr Hobson"  cried Mrs Belfield  "I am quite ashamed of you for being so dull don't you see my son has something to say to the lady that you and I have no business to be meddling with"  "I'm sure ma'am for my part"  said Mr Simkins  "I'm very agreeable to going away for as to putting the young lady to the blush it's what I would not do  no shape"  "I only mean"  said Mr Hobson when he was interrupted by Mrs Belfield who out of all patience now turned him out of the room by the shoulders and pulling Mr Simkins after followed herself and shut the door though Cecilia much provoked desired she would stay and declared repeatedly that all her business was public  Belfield who had looked ready to murder them all during this short scene now approached Cecilia and with an air of mingled spirit and respect said  "I am much grieved much confounded madam that your ears should be offended by speeches so improper to reach them yet if it is possible I can have the honour of being of any use to you in me still I hope you feel you may confide I am too distant from you in situation to give you reason to apprehend I can form any sinister views in serving you and permit me to add I am too near you in mind ever to give you the pain of bidding me remember that distance"  Cecilia then extremely unwilling to shock a sensibility not more generous than jealous determined to continue her enquiries and at the same time to prevent any further misapprehension by revealing her actual situation  "I am sorry Sir"  she answered  "to have occasioned this disturbance Mrs  Belfield I find is wholly unacquainted with the circumstance which now carries me abroad or it would not have happened"  Here a little noise in the passage interrupting her she heard Mrs Belfield though in a low voice say  "Hush Sir hush you must not come in just now you've caught me I confess rather upon the listening order but to tell you the truth I did not know what might be going forward However there's no admittance now I assure you for my son's upon particular business with a lady and Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins and I have all been as good as turned out by them but just now"  Cecilia and Belfie  d though they heard this speech with mutual indignation had no time to mark or express it as it was answered without in a voice at once loud and furious  "  You  madam may be content to listen here pardon me if I am less humbly disposed"  And the door was abruptly opened by young Delvile  Cecilia who half screamed from excess of astonishment would scarcely even by the presence of Belfield and his mother have been restrained from flying to meet him had his own aspect invited such a mark of tenderness but far other was the  case when the door was open he stopt short with a look half petrified his feet seeming rooted to the spot upon which they stood  "I declare I ask pardon ma'am"  cried Mrs Belfield  "but the interruption was no fault of mine for the gentleman would come in and"  "It is no interruption madam"  cried Belfield  "Mr Delvile does me nothing but honour"  "I thank you Sir"  said Delvile trying to recover and come forward but trembling violently and speaking with the most frigid coldness  They were then for a few instants all silent Cecilia amazed by his arrival still more amazed by his behaviour feared to speak lest he meant not as yet to avow his marriage and felt a thousand apprehensions that some new calamity had hurried him home while Belfield was both hurt by his strangeness and embarrassed for the sake of Cecilia and his mother though wondering at them all was kept quiet by her son's looks  Delvile then struggling for an appearance of more ease said  "I seem to have made a general confusion herepray I beg"  "None at all Sir"  said Belfield and offered a chair to Cecilia  "No Sir"  she answered in a voice scarce audible  "I was just going"  And again rang the bell  "I fear I hurry you madam"  cried Delvile whose whole frame was now shaking with uncontrollable emotion  "you are upon businessI ought to beg your pardonmy entrance I believe was unfeasonable"  "Sir"  cried she looking aghast at this speech  "I should have been rather surprised"  he added  "to have met you here so lateso unexpectedlyso deeply engagedhad I not happened to see your servant in the street who told me the honour I should be likely to have by coming"  "Good God"  exclaimed she involuntarily but checking herself as well as she could she courtsied to Mrs Belfield unable to speak to her and avoiding even to look at Belfield who respectfully hung back she hastened out of the room accompanied by Mrs Belfield who again began the most voluble and vulgar apologies for the intrusion she had met with  Delvile also after a moment's pause followed saying  "Give me leave madam to see you to your carriage"  Cecilia then notwithstanding Mrs Belfield still kept talking could no longer refrain saying  "Good heaven what does all this mean"  "Rather for  me  is that queston"  he answered in such agitation he could not though he meant it assist her into the chaise  "for mine I believe is the greater surprise"  "What surprise"  cried she  "explain I conjure you"  "By and bye I will"  he answered  "go on postilion"  "Where Sir"  "Where you came from I suppose"  "What Sir back to Rumford"  "Rumford"  exclaimed he with encreasing disorder  "you came then from Suffolk hitherfrom Suffolk to this very house"  "Good heaven"  cried Cecilia  "come into the chaise and let me speak and hear to be understood"  "Who is that now in it"  "My maid"  "Your maidand she waits for you thus at the door"  "What what is it you mean"  "Tell the man madam whither to go"  "I don't know myselfany where you pleasedo you order him"  "  I  order himyou came not hither to receive orders from  me  where was it you had purposed to rest"  "I don't knowI meant to go to Mrs Hill'sI have no place taken"  "No place taken"  repeated he in a voice faultering between passion and grief  "you purposed then to stay hereI have perhaps driven you away"  "Here"  cried Cecilia mingling in her turn indignation with surprise  "gracious heaven what is it you mean to doubt"  "Nothing"  cried he with emphasis  "I never  have  had I never  will  have a doubt I will  know  I will have  conviction  for every thing Postilion drive to St James'ssquareto Mr Delvile's There madam I will wait upon you"  "No stay postilion"  called out Cecilia seized with terror inexpressible  "let me get out let me speak with you at once"  "  t cannot be I will follow you in a few minutesdrive on postilion"  "No noI will not goI dare not leave youunkind Delvilewhat is it you suspect"  "Cecilia"  cried he putting his hand upon the chaisedoor  "I have ever believed you spotless as an angel and by heaven I believe you so still in spite of appearances  in defiance of every thingNow then be satisfiedI will be with you very soon Mean while take this letter I was just going to send to youPostilion drive on or be at your peril"  The man waited no further orders nor regarded the prohibition of Cecilia who called out to him without ceasing but he would not listen to her till he got to the end of the street he then stopt and she broke the seal of her letter and read by the light of the lamps enough to let her know that Delvile had written it upon the road from Dover to London to acquaint her his mother was now better and had taken pity of his suspense and impatience and insisted upon his coming privately to England to satisfy himself fully about Mr Monckton communicate his marriage to his father and give those orders towards preparing for its being made public which his unhappy precipitation in leaving the kingdom had prevented  This letter which though written but a few hours before she received it was full of tenderness gratitude and anxiety for her happiness instantly convinced her that his strange behaviour had been wholly the effect of a sudden impulse of jealousy excited by so unexpectedly finding her in town at the very house where his father had assured him  she had an improper connexion and alone so suspiciously with the young man affirmed to be her favourite He knew nothing of the ejectment nothing of any reason for her leaving Suffolk every thing had the semblance of no motive but to indulge a private and criminal inclination  These thoughts which confusedly yet forcibly rushed upon her mind brought with them at once an excuse for his conduct and an alarm for his danger  "He must think"  she cried  "I came to town only to meet Mr Belfield"  then opening the chaisedoor herself she jumpt out and ran back into Portlandstreet too impatient to argue with the postilion to return with her and stopt not till she came to Mrs Belfield's house  She knocked at the door with violence Mrs Belfield came to it herself  "Where"  cried she hastily entering as she spoke  "are the gentlemen"  "Lackaday ma'am"  answered Mrs Belfield  "they are both gone out"  "Gone outwhere towhich way"  "I am sure I cant tell ma'am no more than you can but I am sadly afraid they'll have a quarrel before they've done"  "Oh heaven"  cried Cecilia who now doubted not a second duel  "tell me shew me which way they went"  "Why ma'am to let you into the secret"  answered Mrs Belfield  "only I beg you'll take no notice of it to my son but seeing them so much out of sorts I begged the favour of Mr Simkins as Mr Hobson was gone out to his club just to follow them and see what they were after"  Cecilia was much rejoiced this caution had been taken and determined to wait his return She would have sent for the chaise to follow her but Mrs Belfield kept no servant and the maid of the house was employed in preparing the supper  When Mr Simkins came back she learnt after various interruptions from Mrs Belfield and much delay from his own slowness and circumlocution that he had pursued the two gentlemen to the **** coffeehouse  She hesitated not a moment in resolving to follow them she feared the failure of any commission nor did she know whom to entrust with one and the danger was too urgent for much deliberation She begged therefore that Mr Simkins would walk with her to the chaise but hearing that the coffeehouse was another way she desired Mrs Belfield to let the servant run and order it to Mrs Roberts in Fetterlane and then eagerly requested Mr Simkins to accompany her on foot till they met with an hackneycoach  They then set out Mr Simkins feeling  proud and happy in being allowed to attend her while Cecilia glad of any protection accepted his offer of continuing with her even after she met with an hackneycoach  When she arrived at the coffeehouse she ordered the coachman to desire the master of it to come and speak with her  He came and she hastily called out  "Pray are two gentlemen here"  "Here are several gentlemen here madam"  "Yes yesbut are two upon any businessany particular business"  "Two gentlemen madam came about half an hour ago and asked for a room to themselves"  "And where are they noware they up stairsdown stairswhere are they"  "One of them went away in about ten minutes and the other soon after"  Bitterly chagrined and disappointed she knew not what step to take next but after some consideration concluded upon obeying Delvile's own directions and proceeding to St James'ssquare where alone now she seemed to have any chance of meeting with him Gladly however she still consented to be accompanied by Mr Simkins for her dread of being alone at so late an hour in an  hackneycoach was invincible Whether Delvile himself had any authority for directing her to his father's or whether in the perturbation of his newexcited and agonizing sensations of jealousy he had forgotten that any authority was necessary she knew not nor could she now interest herself in the doubt a second scene such as had so lately passed with Mr Monckton occupied all her thoughts she knew the too great probability that the high spirit of Belfield would disdain making the explanation which Delvile in his present agitation might require and the consequence of such a refusal must almost inevitably be fatal  CHAP VII A PURSUIT  THE moment the porter came to the door Cecilia eagerly called out from the coach  "Is Mr Delvile here"  "Yes madam"  he answered  "but I believe he is engaged"  "Oh no matter for any engagement"  cried she  "open the doorI must speak to him this moment"  "If you will please to step into the parlour madam I will tell his gentleman you are here but he will be much displeased if he is disturbed without notice"  "Ah heaven"  exclaimed she  "what Mr Delvile are you talking of"  "My master madam"  Cecilia who had got out of the coach now hastily returned to it and was some time in too great agony to answer either the porter who desired some message or the coachman who asked whither he was to drive To see Mr Delvile unprotected by his son and contrary to his orders appeared to her insupportable yet to what  place could she go where was she likely to meet with Delvile how could he find her if she went to Mrs Hill's and in what other house could she at present claim admittance  After a little recovering from this cruel shock she ventured though in a faultering voice to enquire whether young Mr Delvile had been there  "Yes madam"  the porter answered  "we thought he was abroad but he called just now and asked if any lady had been at the house He would not even stay to go up to my master and we have no  dared tell him of his arrival"  This a little revived her to hear that he had actually been enquiring for her at least assured her of his safety from any immediate violence and she began to hope she might now possibly meet with him time enough to explain all that had past in his absence and occasioned her seemingly strange and suspicious situation at Belfield's She compelled herself therefore to summon courage for seeing his father since as he had directed her to the house she concluded he would return there to seek her when he had wandered else where to no purpose  She then though with much timidity and reluctance sent a message to Mr Delvile to entreat a moment's audience  An answer was brought her that he saw no company so late at night  Losing now all dread of his reproaches in her superior dread of missing Delvile she called out earnestly to the man  "Tell him Sir I beseech him not to refuse me tell him I have something to communicate that requires his immediate attention"  The servant obeyed but soon returning said his master desired him to acquaint her he was engaged every moment he stayed in town and must positively decline seeing her  "Go to him again"  cried the harrassed Cecilia  "assure him I come not from myself but by the desire of one he most values tell him I entreat but permission to wait an hour in his house and that I have no other place in the world whither I can go"  Mr Delvile's own gentleman brought with evident concern the answer to this petition which was that while the Honourable Mr Delvile was himself alive he thought the desire of any other person concerning his house was taking with him a very extraordinary liberty and that he was now going to bed and had given orders to his servants to carry him no more messages whatsoever upon pain of instant dismission  Cecilia now seemed totally destitute of  all resource and for a few dreadful minutes gave herself up to utter despondency nor when she recovered her presence of mind could she form any better plan than that of waiting in the coach to watch the return of Delvile  She told the coachman therefore to drive to a corner of the square begging Mr Simkins to have patience which he promised with much readiness and endeavoured to give her comfort by talking without cessation  She waited here near half an hour She then feared the disappointment of Delvile in not meeting her at first had made him conclude she meant not to obey his directions and had perhaps urged him to call again upon Belfield whom he might fancy privy to her nonappearance This was new horror to her and she resolved at all risks to drive to Portlandstreet and enquire if Belfield himself was returned home Yet lest they should mutually be pursuing each other all night she stopt again at Mr Delvile's and left word with the porter that if young Mr Delvile should come home he would hear of the person he was enquiring for at Mrs Roberts's in Fetterlane To Belfield's she did not dare to direct him and it was her intention if there she procured no new intelligence to leave the same message and  then go to Mrs Roberts without further delay To make such an arrangement with a servant who knew not her connection with his young master was extremely repugnant to her but the exigence was too urgent for scruples and there was nothing to which she would not have consented to prevent the fatal catastrophe she apprehended  When she came to Belfield's not daring to enter the house she sent in Mr Simkins to desire that Mrs Belfield would be so good as to step to the coach door  "Is your son madam"  she cried eagerly  "come home and is any body with him"  "No ma'am he has never once been across the threshold since that gentleman took him out and I am half out of my wits to think"  "Has that gentleman"  interrupted Cecilia  "been here any more"  "Yes ma'am that's what I was going to tell you he came again just now and said"  "Just nowgood heavenand which way is he gone"  "Why he is after no good I am afraid for he was in a great passion and would hardly hear any thing I said"  "Pray pray answer me quickwhere which way did he go"  "Why he asked me if I knew whither my son was come from the ** coffeehouse why says I I'm sure I can't tell for if it had not been for Mr Simkins I should not so much as have known he ever went to the ** coffeehouse however I hope he a'n't come away because if he is poor Miss Beverley will have had all that trouble for nothing for she's gone after him in a prodigious hurry and upon my only saying that he seemed quite beside himself and said if I don't meet with your son at the ** coffeehouse myself pray when he comes in tell him I shall be highly obliged to him to call there and then he went away in as great a pet as ever you saw"  Cecilia listened to this account with the utmost terror and misery the suspicions of Delvile would now be aggravated and the message he had left for Belfield would by him be regarded as a defiance Again however to the ** coffeehouse she instantly ordered the coach an immediate explanation from herself seeming the only possible chance for preventing the most horrible conclusion to this unfortunate and eventful evening  She was still accompanied by Mr Simkins and but that she attended to nothing he said would not inconsiderably have been tormented by his conversation She sent  him immediately into the coffeeroom to enquire if either of the gentleman were then in the house  He returned to her with a waiter who said  "One of them madam called again just now but he only stopt to write a note which he left to be given to the gentleman who came with him at first He is but this moment gone and I don't think he can be at the bottom of the street"  "Oh drive then gallop after him"  cried Cecilia  "coachman go this moment"  "My horses are tired"  said the man  "they have been out all day and they will gallop no further if I don't stop and give them a drink"  Cecilia too full both of hope and impatience for this delay forced open the door herself and without saying another word jumped out of the carriage with intention to run down the street but the coachman immediately seizing her protested she should not stir till he was paid  In the utmost agony of mind at an hindrance by which she imagined Delvile would be lost to her perhaps for ever she put her hand in her pocket in order to give up her purse for her liberty but Mr Simkins who was making a tiresome expostulation with the coachman took it himself and declaring  he would not see the lady cheated began a tedious calculation of his fare  "O pay him any thing"  cried she  "and let us be gone an instant's delay may be fatal"  Mr Simkins too earnest to conquer the coachman to attend to her distress continued his prolix harangue concerning a disputed shilling appealing to some gathering spectators upon the justice of his cause while his adversary who was far from sober still held Cecilia saying the coach had been hired for the lady and he would be paid by herself  "Good God"  cried the agitated Cecilia  "give him my purse at oncegive him every thing he desires"  The coachman at this permission encreased his demands and Mr Simkins taking the number of his coach protested he would summons him to the Court of Conscience the next morning A gentleman who then came out of the coffeehouse offered to assist the lady but the coachman who still held her arm swore he would have his right  "Let me go let me pass"  cried she with encreasing eagerness and emotion  "detain me at your perilrelease me this momentonly let me run to the end  of the streetgood God good Heaven detain me not for mercy"  Mr Simkins humbly desiring her not to be in haste began a formal apology for his conduct but the inebriety of the coachman became evident a mob was collecting Cecilia breathless with vehemence and terror was encircled yet struggled in vain to break away and the stranger gentleman protesting with sundry compliments he would himself take care of her very freely seized her hand  This moment for the unhappy Cecilia teemed with calamity she was wholly overpowered terror for Delvile horror for herself hurry confusion heat and fatigue all assailing her at once while all means of repelling them were denied her the attack was too strong for her fears feelings and faculties and her reason suddenly yet totally failing her she madly called out  "He will be gone he will be gone and I must follow him to Nice"  The gentleman now retreated but Mr Simkins who was talking to the mob did not hear her and the coachman too much intoxicated to perceive her rising frenzy persisted in detaining her  "I am going to France"  cried she still more wildly  "why do you stop me he  will die if I do not see him he will bleed to death"  The coachman still unmoved began to grow very abusive but the stranger touched by compassion gave up his attempted gallantry and Mr Simkins much astonished entreated her not to be frightened she was however in no condition to listen to him with a strength hitherto unknown to her she forcibly disengaged herself from her persecutors yet her senses were wholly disordered she forgot her situation her intention and herself the single idea of Delvile's danger took sole possession of her brain though all connection with its occasion was lost and the moment she was released she fervently clasped her hands exclaiming  "I will yet heal his wound even at the hazard of my life"  and springing forward was almost instantly out of sight  Mr Simkins now much alarmed and earnestly calling after her entered into a compromise with the coachman that he might attend her but the length of his negociation defeated its purpose and before he was at liberty to follow her all trace was lost by which he might have overtaken her He stopt every passenger he met to make enquiries but though they led him on some way they led him on in vain and after a useless and illmanaged pursuit he  went quietly to his own home determining to acqaint Mrs Belfield with what had happened the next morning  Mean while the frantic Cecilia escaped both pursuit and insult by the velocity of her own motion She called aloud upon Delvile as she flew to the end of the street No Delvile was thereshe turned the corner yet saw nothing of him she still went on though unknowing whither the distraction of her mind every instant growing greater from the inflammation of fatigue heat and disappointment She was spoken to repeatedly she was even caught once or twice by her riding habit but she forced herself along by her own vehement rapidity not hearing what was said not heeding what was thought Delvile bleeding by the arm of Belfield was the image before her eyes and took such full possession of her senses that still as she ran on she fancied it in view She scarce touched the ground she scarce felt her own motion she seemed as if endued with supernatural speed gliding from place to place from street to street with no consciousness of any plan and following no other direction than that of darting forward whereever there was most room and turning back when she met with any obstruction till quite spent and exhausted she abruptly ran into a yet  open shop where breathless and panting she sunk upon the floor and with a look disconsolate and helpless sat for some time without speaking  The people of the house concluding at first she was a woman of the town were going roughly to turn her out but soon seeing their mistake by the evident distraction of her air and manner they enquired of some idle people who late as it was had followed her if any of them knew who she was or whence she came  They could give no account of her but supposed she was broke lose from Bedlam  Cecilia then wildly starting up exclaimed  "No noI am not madI am going to Niceto my husband"  "She's quite crazy"  said the man of the house who was a PawnBroker  "we had better get rid of her before she grows mischievous"  "She's somebody broke out from a private mad house I dare say"  said a man who had followed her into the shop  "and if you were to take care of her a little while ten to one but you'll get a reward for it"  "She's a gentlewoman sure enough"  said the mistress of the house  "because she's got such good things on"  And then under pretence of trying to find some direction to her upon a letter  or paper she insisted upon searching her pockets here however she was disappointed in her expectations her purse was in the custody of Mr Simkins but neither her terror nor distress had saved her from the daring dexterity of villainy and her pockets in the mob had been rifled of whatever else they contained The woman therefore hesitated some time whether to take charge of her or not but being urged by the man who made the proposal and who said they might depend upon seeing her soon advertised as having escaped from her keepers they ventured to undertake her  Mean while she endeavoured again to get out calling aloud upon Delvile to rescue her but so wholly bereft of sense and recollection she could give no account who she was whence she came or whither she wished to go  They then carried her up stairs and attempted to make her lie down upon a bed but supposing she refused because it was not of straw they desisted and taking away the candle locked the door and all went to rest  In this miserable condition alone and raving she was left to pass the night in the early part of it she called upon Delvile without intermission beseeching him to come to her defence in one moment and deploring  his death the next but afterwards her strength being wholly exhausted by these various exertions and farigues she threw herself upon the floor and lay for some minutes quite still Her head then began to grow cooler as the fever into which terror and immoderate exercise had thrown her abated and her memory recovered its functions  This was however only a circumstance of horror to her she found herself shut up in a place of confinement without light without knowledge where she was and not a human being near her  Yet the same returning reason which enabled her to take this view of her own situation brought also to her mind that in which she had left Delvileunder all the perturbation of newkindled jealousy just calling upon BelfieldBelfield tenacious of his honour even more than himselfto satisfy doubts of which the very mention would be received as a challenge  "Oh yet oh yet"  cried she  "let me fly and overtake themI may find them before morning and to night it must surely have been too late for this work of death"  She then arose to feel for the door and succeeded but it was locked and no effort she could make enabled her to open it  Her agony was unspeakable she called  out with violence upon the people of the house conjured them to set her at liberty offered any reward for their assistance and threatened them with a prosecution if detained  Nobody however came near her some slept on notwithstanding all the disturbance she could make and others though awakened by her cries concluded them the ravings of a mad woman and listened not to what she said  Her head was by no means in a condition to bear this violence of distress every pulse was throbbing every vein seemed bursting her reason so lately returned could not bear the repetition of such a shock and from supplicating for help with all the energy of feeling and understanding she soon continued the cry from mere vehemence of distraction  Thus dreadfully passed the night and in the morning when the woman of the house came to see after her she found her raving with such frenzy and desperation that her conscience was perfectly at ease in the treatment she had given her being now firmly satisfied she required the strictest confinement  She still however tried to get away talked of Delvile without cessation said she should be too late to serve him told the  woman she desired but to prevent murder and repeatedly called out  "Oh beloved of my heart wait but a moment and I will snatch thee from destruction"  Mrs Wyers this woman now sought no longer to draw from her whence she came or who she was but heard her frantic exclamations without any emotion contentedly concluding that her madness was incurable and though she was in a high fever refused all sustenance and had every symptom of an alarming and dangerous malady she was fully persuaded that her case was that of decided insanity and had not any notion of temporary or accidental alienation of reason  All she could think of by way of indulgence to her was to bring her a quantity of straw having heard that mad people were fond of it and putting it in a heap in one corner of the room she expected to see her eagerly fly to it  Cecilia however distracted as she was was eager for nothing but to escape which was constantly her aim alike when violent or when quiet Mrs Wyers finding this kept her closely confined and the door always locked whether absent or present  CHAP VIII AN ENCOUNTER  TWO whole days passed thus no enquires reached Mrs Wyers and she found in the newspapers no advertisement Meanwhile Cecilia grew worse every moment tasted neither drink nor food raved incessantly called out twenty times in a breath  "Where is he which way is he gone"  and implored the woman by the most pathetic remonstrances to save her unhappy Delvile  dearer to her than life more precious than peace or rest  At other times she talked of her marriage of the displeasure of his family and of her own remorse entreated the woman not to betray her and promised to spend the remnant of her days in the heaviness of sorrow and contrition  Again her fancy roved and Mr Monckton took sole possession of it She reproached him for his perfidy she bewailed that he was massacred she would not a moment outlive him and wildly declared  her last remains should moulder in his hearse  And  thus though naturally and commonly of a silent and quiet disposition she was now not a moment still for the irregular starts of a terrified and disordered imagination were changed into the constant ravings of morbid delirium  The woman growing uneasy from her uncertainty of pay for her trouble asked the advice of some of her friends what was proper for her to do and they counselled her to put an advertisement into the papers herself the next morning  The following therefore was drawn up and sent to the printer of the Daily Advertiser  MADNESS  Whereas a crazy young lady tall fair complexioned with blue eyes and light hair ran into the Three Blue Balls in street on Thursday night the d instant and has been kept there since out of charity She was dressed in a riding habit Whoever she belongs to is desired to send after her immediately She has been treated with the utmost care and tenderness She talks much of some person by the name of Delvile  N B  She had no money about her  May  This had but just been sent off when Mr Wyers the man of the house coming up stairs said  "Now we shall have two of them for here's the crazy old gentleman below that says he has just heard in the neighbourhood of what has happened to us and he desires to see the poor lady"  "It's as well let him come up then"  answered Mrs Wyers  "for he goes to all sort of places and people and ten to one but he'll bustle about till he finds out who she is"  Mr Wyers then went down stairs to send him up  He came instantly It was Albany who in his vagrant rambles having heard an unknown mad lady was at this pawnbroker's came with his customary eagerness to visit and serve the unhappy to see what could be done for her  When he entered the room she was sitting upon the bed her eyes earnestly fixed upon the window from which she was privately indulging a wish to make her escape Her dress was in much disorder her fine hair was dishevelled and the feathers of her riding hat were broken and half falling down some shading her face others reaching to her shoulder  "Poor lady"  cried Albany approaching  her  "how long has she been in this state"  She started at the sound of a new voice she looked roundbut what was the astonishment of Albany to see who it wasHe stept backhe came forwardhe doubted his own senseshe looked at her earnestlyhe turned from her to look at the woman of the househe cast his eyes round the room itself and then lifting up his hands  "O sight of woe"  he cried  "the generous and good the kind reliever of distress the benign sustainer of miseryis  This  Cecilia"  Cecilia imperfectly recollecting though not understanding him sunk down at his feet tremblingly called out  "Oh if he is yet to be saved if already he is not murderedgo to him fly after him you will presently overtake him he is only in the next street I left him there myself his sword drawn and covered with human blood"  "Sweet powers of kindness and compassion"  cried the old man  "look upon this creature with pity she who raised the depressed she who cheared the unhappy she whose liberal hand turned lamentations into joy who never with a tearless eye could hear the voice of sorrowis  This  she herselfcan  This  be Cecilia"  "O do not wait to talk"  cried she  "go to him now or you will never see him more the hand of death is on himcold claycold is its touch he is breathing his lastOh murdered Delvile massacred husband of my heart groan not so piteously fly to him and weep over himfly to him and pluck the poniard from his wounded bosom"  "Oh sounds of anguish and horror"  cried the melted moralist tears running quick down his rugged cheeks  "melancholy indeed is this sight humiliating to morality such is human strength such human felicityweak as our virtues frail as our guilty natures"  "Ah"  cried she more wildly  "no one will save me now I am married and no one will listen to me ill were the auspices under which I gave my hand Oh it was a work of darkness unacceptable and offensive it has been sealed therefore with blood and tomorrow it will be signed with murder"  "Poor distracted creature"  exclaimed he  "thy pangs I have felt but thy innocence I have forfeitedmy own wounds bleed afreshmy own brain threatens new frenzy"  Then starting up  "Good woman"  he added  "kindly attend herI will seek  out her friends put her into bed comfort sooth compose herI will come to you again and as soon as I can"  He then hurried away  "Oh hour of joy"  cried Cecilia  "he is gone to rescue him oh blissful moment he will yet be snatched from slaughter"  The woman lost not an instant in obeying the orders she had received she was put into bed and nothing was neglected as far as she had power and thought to give a look of decency and attention to her accommodations  He had not left them an hour when Mary the maid who had attended her from Suffolk came to enquire for her lady Albany who was now wandering over the town in search of some of her friends and who entered every house where he imagined she was known had hastened to that of Mrs Hill the first of any as he was well acquainted with her obligations to Cecilia there Mary herself by the directions which her lady had given Mrs Belfield had gone and there in the utmost astonishment and uneasiness had continued till Albany brought news of her  She was surprised and afflicted beyond measure not only at the state of her mind and her health but to find her in a bed and an appartment so unsuitable to her  rank of life and so different to what she had ever been accustomed She wept bitterly while she enquired at the bedside how her lady did but wept still more when without answering or seeming to know her Cecilia started up and called out  "I must be removed this moment I must go to St James'ssquareif I stay an instant longer the passingbell will toll and then how shall I be in time for the funeral"  Mary alarmed and amazed turned hastily from her to the woman of the house who calmly said the lady was only in a raving fit and must not be minded  Extremely frightened at this intelligence she entreated her to be quiet and lie still But Cecilia grew suddenly so violent that force only could keep her from rising and Mary unused to dispute her commands prepared to obey them  Mrs Wyers now in her turn opposed in vain Cecilia was peremptory and Mary became implicit and though not without much difficulty she was again dressed in her riding habit This operation over she moved towards the door the temporary strength of delirium giving her a hardiness that combated fever illness fatigue and feebleness Mary however averse and fearful assisted her and Mrs Wyers  compelled by the obedience of her own servant went before them to order a chair  Cecilia however felt her weakness when she attempted to move down stairs her feet tottered and her head became dizzy she leaned it against Mary who called aloud for more help and made her sit down till it came Her resolution however was not to be altered a stubbornness wholly foreign to her genuine character now made her stern and positive and Mary who thought her submission indispensable cried but did not offer to oppose her  Mr and Mrs Wyers both came up to assist in supporting her and Mr Wyers offered to carry her in his arms but she would not consent when she came to the bottom of the stairs her head grew worse she again lent it upon Mary but Mr Wyers was obliged to hold them both She still however was firm in her determination and was making another effort to proceed when Delvile rushed hastily into the shop  He had just encountered Albany who knowing his acquaintance though ignorant of his marriage with Cecilia had informed him where to seek her  He was going to make enquiry if he was come to the right house when he perceived herfeeble shaking leaning upon  one person and half carried by anotherhe started back staggered gasped for breathbut finding they were proceeding advanced with trepidation furiously calling out  "Hold stopwhat is it you are doing Monsters of savage barbarity are you murdering my wife"  The wellknown voice no sooner struck the ears of Cecilia than instantly recollecting it she screamed and in suddenly endeavouring to spring forward fell to the ground  Delvile had vehemently advanced to catch her in his arms and save her fall which her unexpected quickness had prevented her attendants from doing but the sight of her changed complection and the wildness of her eyes and air again made him starthis blood froze through his veins and he stood looking at her cold and almost petrified  Her own recollection of him seemed lost already and exhausted by the fatigue she had gone through in dressing and coming down stairs she remained still and quiet forgetting her design of proceeding and forming no new one for returning  Mary to whom as to all her fellow servants the marriage of Cecilia had been known before she left the country now  desired from Delvile directions what was to be done  Delvile starting suddenly at this call from the deepest horror into the most desperate rage fiercely exclaimed  "Inhuman wretches unfeeling execrable wretches what is it you have done to her how came she hitherwho brought her who dragged herby what infamous usage has she been sunk into this state"  "Indeed sir I don't know"  cried Mary  "I assure you sir"  said Mrs Wyers  "the lady"  "Peace"  cried he furiously  "I will not hear your falshoodspeace and begone"  Then casting himself upon the ground by her side  "Oh my Cecilia"  he cried  "where hast thou been thus long how have I lost thee what dreadful calamity has befallen theeanswer me my love raise your sweet head and answer meoh speaksay to me any thing the bitterest words will be mercy to this silence"  Cecilia then suddenly looking up called out with great quickness  "Who are you"  "Who am I"  cried he amazed and affrighted  "I should be glad you would go away"  cried she in a hurrying manner  "for you are quite unknown to me"  Delvile unconscious of her insanity and attributing to resentment this aversion and repulse hastily moved from her mournfully answering  "Well indeed may you disclaim me refuse all forgiveness load me with hatred and reproach and consign me to eternal anguish I have merited severer punishment still I have behaved like a monster and I am abhorrent to myself"  Cecilia now half rising and regarding him with mingled terror and anger eagerly exclaimed  "If you do not mean to mangle and destroy me begone this instant"  "To mangle you"  repeated Delvile shuddering  "how horriblebut I deserve itlook not however so terrified and I will tear myself away from you Suffer me but to assist in removing you from this place and I will only watch you at a distance and never see you more till you permit me to approach you"  "Why why"  cried Cecilia with a look of perplexity and impatience  "will you not tell me your name and where you come from"  "Do you not know me"  said he struck with new horror  "or do you only mean to kill me by the question"  "Do you bring me any message from Mr Monckton"  "From Mr Moncktonno but he lives and will recover"  "I thought you had been Mr Monckton yourself"  "Too cruel yet justly cruel Ceciliais then Delvile utterly renouncedthe guilty the unhappy Delvileis he cast off for ever have you driven him wholly from your heart do you deny him even a place in your remembrance"  "Is your name then Delvile"  "O what is it you mean is it me or my name you thus disown"  "'Tis a name"  cried she sitting up  "I well remember to have heard and once I loved it and three times I called upon it in the dead of night And when I was cold and wretched I cherished it and when I was abandoned and left alone I repeated it and sung to it"  "Allgracious powers"  cried Delvile  "her reason is utterly gone"  And hastily rising he desperately added  "what is death to this blowCecilia I am content to part with thee"  Mary now and Mrs Wyers poured upon him eagerly an account of her illness and insanity her desire of removal and their inability to control her  Delvile however made no answer he scarce heard them the deepest despair took possession of his mind and rooted to the spot where he stood he contemplated in dreadful stillness the fallen and altered object of his best hopes and affections already in her faded cheeks and weakened frame his agonizing terror read the quick impending destruction of all his earthly happiness the sight was too much for his fortitude and almost for his understanding and when his woe became utterable he wrung his hands and groaning aloud called out  "Art thou gone so soon my wife my Cecilia have I lost thee already"  Cecilia with utter insensibility to what was passing now suddenly and with a rapid yet continued motion turned her head from side to side her eyes wildly glaring yet apparently regarding nothing  "Dreadful dreadful"  exclaimed Delvile  "what a sight is this"  and turning from her to the people of the house he angrily said  "why is she here upon the floor could you not even allow her a bed  Who attends her Who waits upon her Why has nobody sent for helpDon't answer meI will not hear you fly this moment for a physicianbring two bring threebring all you can find"  Then still looking from Cecilia whose sight he could no longer support he consulted with Mary whither she should be conveyed and as the night was far advanced and no place was prepared for her elsewhere they soon agreed that she could only be removed up stairs  Delvile now attempted to carry her in his arms but trembling and unsteady he had not strength to sustain her yet not enduring to behold the helplessness he could not assist he conjured them to be careful and gentle and committing her to their trust ran out himself for a physician  Cecilia resisted them with her utmost power imploring them not to bury her alive and averring she had received intelligence they meant to entomb her with Mr Monckton  They put her however to bed but her raving grew still more wild and incessant  Delvile soon returned with a physician but had not courage to attend him to her room He waited for him at the foot of the stairs where hastily stopping him  "Well sir"  he cried  "is it not all over is it not impossible she can live"  "She is very ill indeed sir"  he answered  "but I have given directions which perhaps"  "  Perhaps  "  interrupted Delvile shuddering  "do not stab me with such a word"  "She is very delirious"  he continued  "but as her fever is very high that is not so material If the orders I have given take effect and the fever is got under all the rest will be well of course"  He then went away leaving Delvile as much thunderstruck by answers so alarming as if he had consulted him in full hope and without even suspicion of her danger  The moment he recovered from this shock he flew out of the house for more advice  He returned and brought with him two physicians  They confirmed the directions already given but would pronounce nothing decisively of her situation  Delvile half mad with the acuteness of his misery charged them all with want of skill and wrote instantly into the country for Dr Lyster  He went out himself in search of a messenger to ride off express though it was midnight with his letter and then returning he was hastening to her room but while yet at the door hearing her still raving his horror conquered his eagerness and hurrying down stairs he spent the remnant of the long and seemingly endless night in the shop  CHAP IX A TRIBUTE  MEANWHILE Cecilia went thro' very severe discipline sometimes strongly opposing it at other times scarce sensible what was done to her  The whole of the next day passed in much the same manner neither did the next night bring any visible alteration She had now nurses and attendants even more than sufficient for Delvile had no relief but from calling in more help His terror of again seeing her encreased with his forbearance the interview which had already past had almost torn him asunder and losing all courage for attempting to enter her room he now spent almost all his time upon the stairs which led to it Whenever she was still he seated himself at her chamber door where if he could hear her breathe or move a sudden hope of her recovery gave to him a momentary extasy that recompensed all his sufferings But the instant she spoke unable to bear the sound of so loved a voice uttering nothing  but the incoherent ravings of lightheadedness he hastened down stairs and flying out of the house walked in the neighbouring streets till he could again gather courage to enquire or to listen how she went on  The following morning however Dr Lyster came and every hope revived He flew to embrace him told him instantly his marriage with Cecilia and besought him by some superior effort of his extraordinary abilities to save him the distraction of her loss  "My good friend"  cried the worthy Doctor  "what is this you ask of me and how can this poor young lady herself want advice more than you do Do you think these able physicians actually upon the spot with all the experience of full practice in London to assist their skill want a petty Doctor out of the country to come and teach them what is right"  "I have more reliance upon you"  cried Delvile  "than upon the whole faculty come therefore and prescribe for hertake some new course"  "Impossible my good Sir impossible I must not lose my wits from vanity because you have lost yours from affliction I could not refuse to come to you when you wrote to me with such urgency and I will  now go and see the young lady as a  friend  with all my heart I am sorry for you at my soul Mr Mortimer She is a lovely young creature and has an understanding for her years and sex unequalled"  "Never mention her to me"  cried the impatient Delvile  "I cannot bear it Go up to her dear Doctor and if you want a consultation send if you please for every physician in town"  Dr Lyster desired only that those who had already attended might be summoned and then giving up to his entreaties the accustomed ceremonial of waiting for them he went to Cecilia  Delvile did not dare accompany him and so well was he acquainted with his plainness and sincerity that though he expected his return with eagerness he no sooner heard him upon the stairs than fearing to know his opinion he hastily snatched up his hat and rushed vehemently out of the house to avoid him  He continued to walk about the streets till even the dread of ill news was less horrible to him than this voluntary suspense and then he returned to the house  He found Dr Lyster in a small back parlour which Mrs Wyers finding she should now be well paid had appropriated for Delvile's use  Delvile putting his hand upon the Doctor's shoulder said  "Well my dear Doctor Lyster  you  still I hope"  "I would I could make you easy"  interrupted the Doctor  "yet if you are rational one comfort at all events I can give you the crisis seems approaching and either she will recover or before tomorrow morning"  "Don't go on Sir"  cried Delvile with mingled rage and horror  "I will not have her days limited I sent not for you to give me such an account"  And again he flew out of the house leaving Dr Lyster unaffectedly concerned for him and too kindhearted and too wise to be offended at the injustice of immoderate sorrow  In a few minutes however from the effect rather of despair than philosophy Delvile grew more composed and waited upon Dr Lyster to apologize for his behaviour He received his hearty forgiveness and prevailed upon him to continue in town till the whole was decided  About noon Cecilia from the wildest rambling and most perpetual agitation sunk suddenly into a state of such utter insensibility that she appeared unconscious even of her existence and but that she breathed she might already have passed for being dead  When Delvile heard this he could no longer endure even his post upon the stairs he spent his whole time in wandering about the streets or stopping in Dr Lyster's parlour to enquire if all was over  That humane physician not more alarmed at the danger of Cecilia than grieved at the situation of Delvile thought the present fearful crisis at least offered an opportunity of reconciling him with his father He waited therefore upon that gentleman in St James'ssquare and openly informed him of the dangerous state of Cecilia and the misery of his son  Mr Delvile though he would gladly to have annulled an alliance he held disgraceful to his family have received intelligence that Cecilia was no more was yet extremely disconcerted to hear of sufferings to which his own refusal of an asylum he was conscious had largely contributed and after a haughty struggle between tenderness and wrath he begged the advice of Dr Lyster how his son might be drawn from such a scene  Dr Lyster who well knew Delvile was too desperate to be tractable proposed surprising him into an interview by their returning together Mr Delvile however apprehensive and relenting conceded most unwillingly to a measure he held beneath  him and when he came to the shop could scarce be persuaded to enter it Mortimer at that time was taking a solitary ramble and Dr Lyster to complete the work he had begun of subduing the hard pride of his father contrived under pretence of waiting for him to conduct him to the room of the invalide  Mr Delvile who knew not whither he was going at first sight of the bed and the attendants was hastily retreating but the changed and livid face of Cecilia caught his eye and struck with sudden consternation he involuntarily stopt  "Look at the poor young lady"  cried Dr Lyster  "can you wonder a sight such as this should make Mr Mortimer forget every thing else"  She was wholly insensible but perfectly quiet she seemed to distinguish nothing and neither spoke nor moved  Mr Delvile regarded her with the utmost horror the refuge he so implacably refused her on the night when her intellects were disordered he would now gladly have offered at the expence of almost similar sufferings to have relieved himself from those rising pangs which called him author of this scene of woe His pride his pomp his ancient name were now sunk in his estimation and while he considered himself  the destroyer of this unhappy young creature he would have sacrificed them all to have called himself her protector Little is the boast of insolence when it is analysed by the conscience bitter is the agony of selfreproach where misery follows hardness of heart yet when the first painful astonishment from her situation abated the remorse she excited being far stronger than the pity he gave an angry glance at Dr Lyster for betraying him into such a  ight and hastily left the room  Delvile who was now impatiently waiting to see Dr Lyster in the little parlour alarmed at the sound of a new step upon the stairs came out to enquire who had been admitted When he saw his father he shrunk back but Mr Delvile no longer supported by pride and unable to recover from the shock he had just received caught him in his arms and said  "Oh come home to me my son this is a place to destroy you"  "Ah Sir"  cried Delvile  "think not of me nowyou must shew me no kindness I am not in a state to bear it"  And forcibly breaking from him he hurried out of the house  Mr Delvile all the father awakened in his bosom saw his departure with more dread than anger and returned himself to  St James'ssquare tortured with parental fears and stung by personal remorse lamenting his own inflexibility and pursued by the pale image of Cecilia  She was still in this unconscious state and apparently as free from suffering as from enjoyment when a new voice was suddenly heard without exclaiming  "Oh where is she where is she where is my dear Miss Beverley"  and Henrietta Belfield ran wildly into the room  The advertisement in the newspapers had at once brought her to town and directed her to the house the mention that the lost lady  talked much of a person by the name of Delvile  struck her instantly to mean Cecilia the description corresponded with this idea and the account of the dress confirmed it Mr Arnott equally terrified with herself had therefore lent her his chaise to learn the truth of this conjecture and she had travelled all night  Flying up to the bedside  "Who is this"  she cried  "this is not Miss Beverley"  and then screaming with unrestrained horror  "Oh mercy mercy"  she called out  "yes it is indeed and nobody would know herher own mother would not think her her child"  "You must come away Miss Belfield"  said Mary  "you must indeedthe doctors all say my lady must not be disturbed"  "Who shall take me away"  cried she angrily  "nobody Mary not all the doctors in the world Oh sweet Miss Beverly I will lie down by your sideI will never quit you while you liveand I wish I wish I could die to save your precious life"  Then leaning over her and wringing her hands  "Oh I shall break my heart"  she cried  "to see her in this condition Is this the so happy Miss Beverley that I thought every body born to give joy to the Miss Beverley that seemed queen of the whole world yet so good and so gentle so kind to the meanest person excusing every body's faults but her own and telling them how they might mend and trying to make them as good as herselfOh who would know her who would know her what have they done to you my beloved Miss Beverley how have they altered and disfigured you in this wicked and barbarous manner"  In the midst of this simple yet pathetic testimony to the worth and various excellencies of Cecilia Dr Lyster came into the room The women all flocked around him except Mary to vindicate themselves from any share in permitting this new comer's entrance and behaviour but Mary only told him who she was and said that if her lady was well enough to know her there  was nobody she was certain she would have been so glad to see  "Young lady"  said the doctor  "I would advise you to walk into another room till you are a little more composed  "Every body I find is for hurrying me away"  cried the sobbing Henrietta whose honest heart swelled with its own affectionate integrity  "but they might all save themselves the trouble for go I will not"  "This is very wrong"  said the doctor  "and must not be suffered do you call it friendship to come about a sick person in this manner"  "Oh my Miss Beverley"  cried Henrietta  "do you hear how they all upbraid me how they all want to force me away from you and to hinder me even from looking at you Speak for me sweet lady speak for me yourself tell them the poor Henrietta will not do you any harm tell them she only wishes just to sit by you and to see youI will hold by this dear handI will cling to it till the last minute and you will not I know you will not give orders to have it taken away from me"  Dr Lyster though his own good nature was much affected by this fond sorrow now half angrily represented to her the impropriety of indulging it but Henrietta  unused to disguise or repress her feelings grew only the more violent the more she was convinced of Cecilia's danger  "Oh look but at her"  she exclaimed  "and take me from her if you can see how her sweet eyes are fixed look but what a change in her complexionShe does not see me she does not know meshe does not hear me her hand seems quite lifeless already her face is all fallen awayOh that I had died twenty deaths before I had lived to see this  ightpoor wretched Henrietta thou hast now no friend left in the world thou mayst go and lie down in some corner and no one will come and say to thee a word of comfort"  "This must not be"  said Dr Lyster  "you must take her away"  "You shall not"  cried she desperately  "I will stay with her till she has breathed her last and I will stay with her still longer and if she was to speak to you at this moment she would tell you that she chose it She loved the poor Henrietta and loved to have her near her and when she was ill and in much distress she never once bid me leave her room Is it not true my sweet Miss Beverley do you not know it to be true Oh look not so dreadfully turn to your unhappy Henrietta sweetest best of ladies will you not speak  to her once more will you not say to her one single word"  Dr Lyster now grew very angry and telling her such violence might have fatal consequences frightened her into more order and drew her away himself He had then the kindness to go with her into another room where when her first vehemence was spent his remonstrances and reasoning brought her to a sense of the danger she might occasion and made her promise not to return to the room till she had gained strength to behave better  When Dr Lyster went again to Delvile he found him greatly alarmed by his long stay he communicated to him briefly what had passed and counselled him to avoid encreasing his own grief by the sight of what was suffered by this unguarded and ardent girl Delvile readily assented for the weight of his own woe was too heavy to bear any addition  Henrietta now kept in order by Dr Lyster contented herself with only sitting upon the bed without attempting to speak and with no other employment than alternately looking at her sick friend and covering her streaming eyes with her handkerchief from time to time quitting the room wholly for the relief of sobbing at liberty and aloud in another  But in the evening while Delvile and Dr Lyster were taking one of their melancholy rambles a new scene was acted in the apartment of the still senseless Cecilia Albany suddenly made his entrance into it accompanied by three children two girls and one boy from the ages of four to six neatly dressed clean and healthy  "See here"  cried he as he came in  "see here what I have brought you raise raise your languid head and look this way you think me rigidan enemy to pleasure austere harsh and a forbidder of joy look at this sight and see the contrary who shall bring you comfort joy pleasure like this three innocent children clothed and fed by your bounty"  Henrietta and Mary who both knew him well were but little surprised at any thing he said or did and the nurses presumed not to interfere but by whispers  Cecilia however observed nothing that passed and Albany somewhat astonished approached nearer to the bed  "Wilt thou not speak"  he cried  "She can't Sir"  said one of the women  "she has been speechless many hours"  The air of triumph with which he had entered the room was now changed into disappointment and consternation For some minutes he thoughtfully and sorrowfully  contemplated her and then with a deep sigh said  "How will the poor rue this day"  Then turning to the children who awed by this scene were quiet from terror  "Alas"  he said  "ye helpless babes ye know not what you have lost presumptuously we came unheeded we must return I brought you to be seen by your benefactress but she is going where she will find many such"  He then led them away but suddenly coming back  "I may see her perhaps no more shall I not then pray for her Great and aweful is the change she is making what are human revolutions how pitiful how insignificant compared with itCome little babies come with gifts has she often blessed  you  with wishes bless  her  Come let us kneel round her bed let us all pray for her together lift up your innocent hands and for all of you I will speak"  He then made the children obey his injunctions and having knelt himself while Henrietta and Mary instantly did the same  "Sweet flower"  he cried  "untimely cropt in years yet in excellence mature early decayed in misery yet fragrant in innocence Gentle be thy exit for unsullied have been thy days brief be thy pains for  few have been thy offences Look at her sweet babes and bear her in your remembrance often will I visit you and revive the solemn scene Look at her ye also who are nearer to your endAh will you bear it like her"  He paused and the nurses and Mrs Wyers struck by this call and moved by the general example crept to the bed and dropt on their knees almost involuntarily  "She departs"  resumed Albany  "the envy of the world while yet no guilt had seized her soul and no remorse had marred her peace She was the handmaid of charity and pity dwelt in her bosom her mouth was never opened but to give comfort her footsteps were followed by blessings Oh happy in purity be thine the song of triumphsoftly shalt thou sink to temporary sleepsublimely shalt thou rise to life that wakes for ever"  He then got up took the children by their little hands and went away  CHAP X A TERMINATION  DR Lyster and Delvile met them at the entrance into the house Extremely alarmed lest Cecilia had received any disturbance they both hastened up stairs but Delvile proceeded only to the door He stopt there and listened but all was silent the prayers of Albany had struck an awe into every one and Dr Lyster soon returned to tell him there was no alteration in his patient  "And he has not disturbed her"  cried Delvile  "No not at all"  "I think then"  said he advancing though trembling  "I will yet see her once more"  "No no Mr Mortimer"  cried the doctor  "why should you give yourself so unnecessary a shock"  "The shock"  answered he  "is overtell me however is there any chance I may hurt  her  "  "I believe not I do not think just now she will perceive you"  "Well thenI may grieve perhaps hereafter that once morethat one glance"  He stopt irresolute the doctor would again have dissuaded him but after a little hesitation he assured him he was prepared for the worst and forced himself into the room  When again however he beheld Ceciliasenseless speechless motionless her features void of all expression her cheeks without colour her eyes without meaninghe shrunk from the sight he leant upon Dr Lyster and almost groaned aloud  The doctor would have conducted him out of the apartment but recovering from this first agony he turned again to view her and casting up his eyes fervently ejaculated  "Oh merciful powers Take or destroy her let her not linger thus rather let me loss her for everOh far rather would I see her dead than in this dreadful condition"  Then advancing to the bed side and yet more earnestly looking at her  "I pray not now"  he cried  "for thy life inhumanly as I have treated thee I am not yet so hardened as to wish thy misery lengthened no quick be thy restoration or short as pure thy passage to eternityOh my Cecilia lovely however altered sweet even in the arms of death and insanity and dearer  to my tortured heart in this calamitous state than in all thy pride of health and beauty"  He stopt and turned from her yet could not tear himself away he came back he again looked at her he hung over her in anguish unutterable he kissed each burning hand he folded to his bosom her feeble form and recovering his speech though almost bursting with sorrow faintly articulated  "Is all over no ray of reason left no knowledge of thy wretched Delvileno none the hand of death is on her and she is utterly gonesweet suffering excellence loved lost expiring Ceciliabut I will not repine peace and kindred angels are watching to receive thee and if thou art parted from thyself it were impious to lament thou shouldst be parted from meYet in thy tomb will be deposited all that to me could render existence supportable every frail chance of happiness every sustaining hope and all alleviation of sorrow"  Dr Lyster now again approaching thought he perceived some change in his patient and peremptorily forced him away from her then returning himself he found that her eyes were shut and she was dropt asleep  This was an omen the most favourable  he could hope He now seated himself by the bedside and determined not to quit her till the expected crisis was past He gave the strictest orders for the whole house to be kept quiet and suffered no one in the room either to speak or move  Her sleep was long and heavy yet when she awoke her sensibility was evidently returned She started suddenly raised her head from the pillow looked round her and called out  "where am I now"  "Thank Heaven"  cried Henrietta and was rushing forward when Dr Lyster by a stern and angry look compelled her again to take her seat  He then spoke to her himself enquired how she did and found her quite rational  Henrietta who now doubted not her perfect recovery wept as violently for joy as she had before wept for grief and Mary in the same belief ran instantly to Delvile eager to carry to him the first tidings that her mistress had recovered her reason  Delvile in the utmost emotion then returned to the chamber but stood at some distance from the bed waiting Dr Lyster's permission to approach it  Cecilia was quiet and composed her recollection seemed restored and her intellects sound but she was faint and weak  and contentedly silent to avoid the effort of speaking  Dr Lyster encouraged this stillness and suffered not any one not even Delvile to advance to her After a short time however she again and very calmly began to talk to him She now first knew him and seemed much surprised by his attendance She could not tell she said what of late had happened to her nor could guess where she was or by what means she came into such a place Dr Lyster desired her at present not to think upon the subject and promised her a full account of every thing when she was stronger and more fit for conversing  This for a while silenced her But after a short pause  "Tell me"  she said  "Dr Lyster have I no friend in this place but you"  "Yes yes you have several friends here"  answered the Doctor  "only I keep them in order lest they should hurry or disturb you"  She seemed much pleased by this speech but soon after said  "You must not Doctor keep them in order much longer for the sight of them I think would much revive me"  "Ah Miss Beverley"  cried Henrietta who could not now restrain herself  "may  not  I  among the rest come and speak to you"  "Who is that"  said Cecilia in a voice of pleasure though very feeble  "is it my everdear Henrietta"  "Oh this is joy indeed"  cried she fervently kissing her cheeks and forehead  "joy that I never never expected to have more"  "Come come"  cried Doctor Lyster  "here's enough of this did I not do well to keep such people off"  "I believe you did"  said Cecilia faintly smiling  "my too kind Henrietta you must be more tranquil"  "I will I will indeed madammy dear dear Miss Beverley I will indeednow once you have owned me and once again I hear your sweet voice I will do any thing and every thing for I am made happy for my whole life"  "Ah sweet Henrietta"  cried Cecilia giving her her hand  "you must suppress these feelings or our Doctor here will soon part us But tell me Doctor is there no one else that you can let me see"  Delvile who had listened to this scene in the unspeakable perturbation of that hope which is kindled from the very ashes of despair was now springing forward but Dr Lyster fearful of the consequences hastily  arose and with a look and air not to be disputed took hold of his arm and led him out of the room He then represented to him strongly the danger of agitating or disturbing her and charged him to keep from her sight till better able to bear it assuring him at the same time that he might now reasonably hope her recovery  Delvile lost in transport could make no answer but flew into his arms and almost madly embraced him he then hastened out of sight to pour forth fervent thanks and hurrying back with equal speed again embraced the Doctor and while his manly cheeks were burnt with tears of joy he could not yet articulate the glad tumult of his soul  The worthy Dr Lyster who heartily partook of his happiness again urged him to be discreet and Delvile no longer intractable and desperate gratefully concurred in whatever he commanded Dr Lyster then returned to Cecilia and to relieve her mind from any uneasy suspense talked to her openly of Delvile gave her to understand he was acquainted with her marriage and told her he had prohibited their meeting till each was better able to support it  Cecilia by this delay seemed half gratified and half disappointed but the rest of the physicians who had been summoned  upon this happy change now appearing the orders were yet more strictly enforced for keeping her quiet  She submitted therefore peaceably and Delvile whose gladdened heart still throbbed with speechless rapture contentedly watched at her chamber door and obeyed implicitly whatever was said to him  She now visibly and almost hourly grew better and in a short time her anxiety to know all that was passed and by what means she became so ill and confined in a house of which she had not any knowledge obliged Dr Lyster to make himself master of these particulars that he might communicate them to her with a calmness that Delvile could not attain  Delvile himself happy to be spared the bitter task of such a relation informed him all he knew of the story and then entreated him to narrate to her also the motives of his own strange and he feared unpardonable conduct and the scenes which had followed their parting  He came he said to England ignorant of all that had past in his absence intending merely to wait upon his father and communicate his marriage before he gave directions to his lawyer for the settlements and preparations which were to precede its  further publication He meant also to satisfy himself of the real situation of Mr Monckton and then after an interview with Cecilia to have returned to his mother and waited at Nice till he might publicly claim his wife  To this purpose he had written in his letter which he meant to have put in the Postoffice in London himself and he had but just alighted from his chaise when he met Ralph Cecilia's servant in the street  Hastily stopping him he enquired if he had left his place  "No"  answered Ralph  "I am only come up to town with my lady"  "With your lady"  cried the astonished Delvile  "is your lady then in town"  "Yes sir she is at Mrs Belfield's"  "At Mrs Belfield'sis her daughter returned home"  "No sir we left her in the country"  He was then going on with a further account but in too much confusion of mind to hear him Delvile abruptly wished him good night and marched on himself towards Belfield's  The pleasure with which he would have heard that Cecilia was so near to him was totally lost in his perplexity to account for her journey Her letters had never hinted at such a purposethe news reached him  only by accidentit was ten o'clock at nightyet she was at Belfield'sthough the sister was awaythough the mother was professedly odious to herIn an instant all he had formerly heard all he had formerly disregarded rushed suddenly upon his memory and he began to believe he had been deluded that his father was right and that Belfield had some strange and improper influence over her heart  The suspicion was death to him he drove it from him he concluded the whole was some error his reason as powerfully as his tenderness vindicated her innocence and though he arrived at the house in much disorder he yet arrived with a firm persuasion of an honourable explanation  The door was opena chaise was at it in waitingMrs Belfield was listening in the passage these appearances were strange and encreased his agitation He asked for her son in a voice scarce audibleshe told him he was engaged with a lady and must not be disturbed  That fatal answer at a moment so big with the most horrible surmises was decisive furiously therefore he forced himself past her and opened the doorbut when he saw them togetherthe rest of the family confessedly excluded his rage  turned to horror and he could hardly support himself  "O Dr Lyster"  he continued  "ask of the sweet creature if these circumstances offer any extenuation for the fatal jealousy which seized me never by myself while I live will it be forgiven but she perhaps who is all softness all compassion and all peace may some time hence think my sufferings almost equal to my offence"  He then proceeded in his narration  When he had so peremptorily ordered her chaise to St James'ssquare he went back to the house and desired Belfield to walk out with him He complied and they were both silent till they came to a Coffeehouse where they asked for a private room The whole way they went his heart secretly satisfied of the purity of Cecilia smote him for the situation in which he had left her yet having unfortunately gone so far as to make his suspicions apparent he thought it necessary to his character that their abolition should be equally public  When they were alone  "Belfield"  he said  "to obviate any imputation of impertinence in my enquiries I deny not what I presume you have been told by herself that I have the nearest interest in whatever  concerns the lady from whom we are just now parted I must beg therefore an explicit account of the purpose of your private conversation with her"  "Mr Delvile"  answered Belfield with mingled candour and spirit  "I am not commonly much disposed to answer enquiries thus cavalierly put to me yet here as I find myself not the principal person concerned I think I am bound in justice to speak for the absent who is I assure you therefore most solemnly that your interest in Miss Beverley I never heard but by common report that our being alone together was by both of us undesigned and undesired that the honour she did our house in calling at it was merely to acquaint my mother with my sister's removal to Mrs Harrel's and that the part which I had myself in her condescension was simply to be consulted upon a journey which she has in contemplation to the South of France And now sir having given you this peaceable satisfaction you will find me extremely at your service to offer any other"  Delvile instantly held out his hand to him  "What you assert"  he said  "upon your honour requires no other testimony Your gallantry and your probity are equally well known to me with either therefore  I am content and by no means require the intervention of both"  They then parted and now his doubts removed and his punctilio satisfied he flew to St James'ssquare to entreat the forgiveness of Cecilia for the alarm he had occasioned her and to hear the reason of her sudden journey and change of measures But when he came there to find that his father whom he had concluded was at Delvile Castle was in the house while Cecilia had not even enquired for him at the door  Oh let me not"  he continued  "even to myself let me not trace the agony of that momentwhere to seek her I knew not why she was in London I could not divine for what purpose she had given the postilion a new direction I could form no idea Yet it appeared that she wished to avoid me and once more in the frenzy of my disappointment I supposed Belfield a party in her concealment Again therefore I sought himat his own houseat the coffeehouse where I had left himin vain wherever I came I just missed him for hearing of my search he went with equal restlessness from place to place to meet me I rejoice we both failed a repetition of my enquiries in my then irritable state must inevitably have provoked the most fatal resentment  "I will not dwell upon the scenes that  followedmy laborious search my fruitless wanderings the distraction of my suspense the excess of my despaireven Belfield the fiery Belfield when I met with him the next day was so much touched by my wretchedness that he bore with all my injustice feeling noble young man never will I lose the remembrance of his highsouled patience  "And now Dr Lyster go to my Cecilia tell her this tale and try for you have skill sufficient to soften yet not wound her with my sufferings If then she can bear to see me to bless me with the sound of her sweet voice no longer at war with her intellects to hold out to me her loved hand in token of peace and forgivenessOh Dr Lyster preserver of  my  life in hers give to me but that exquisite moment and every past evil will be for ever obliterated"  "You must be calmer Sir"  said the Doctor  "before I make the attempt These heroicks are mighty well for sound health and strong nerves but they will not do for an invalide"  He went however to Cecilia and gave her this narration suppressing whatever he feared would most affect her and judiciously enlivening the whole by his strictures Cecilia was much easier for this removal of  her perplexities and as her anguish and her terror had been unmixed with resentment she had now no desire but to reconcile Delvile with himself  Dr Lyster however by his friendly authority obliged her for some time to be content with this relation but when she grew better her impatience became stronger and he feared opposition would be as hurtful as compliance  Delvile therefore was now admitted yet slowly and with trepidation he advanced terrified for her and fearful of himself filled with remorse for the injuries she had sustained and impressed with grief and horror to behold her so ill and altered  Supported by pillows she sat almost upright The moment she saw him she attempted to bend forward and welcome him calling out in a tone of pleasure though faintly  "Ah dearest Delvile is it you"  but too weak for the effort she had made she sunk back upon her pillow pale trembling and disordered  Dr Lyster would then have interfered to postpone their further conversation but Delvile was no longer master of himself or his passions he darted forward and kneeling at the bed side  "Sweet injured excellence"  he cried  "wife of my heart sole object of my chosen affection dost thou  yet live do I hear thy loved voicedo I see thee againart thou my Cecilia and have I indeed not lost thee"  then regarding her more fixedly  "Alas"  he cried  "art thou indeed my Cecilia so pale so emaciatedOh suffering angel and couldst thou then call upon Delvile the guilty but heartbroken Delvile thy destroyer thy murderer and yet not call to execrate him"  Cecilia extremely affected could not utter a word she held out to him her hand she looked at him with gentleness and kindness but tears started into her eyes and trickled in large drops down her colourless cheeks  "Angelic creature"  cried Delvile his own tears overflowing while he pressed to his lips the kind token of her pardon  "can you give to me again a hand so ill deserved can you look with such compassion on the author of your woes on the wretch who for an instant could doubt the purity of a mind so seraphic"  "Ah Delvile"  cried she a little reviving  "think no more of what is pastto see youto be yoursdrives all evil from my remembrance"  "I am not worthy this joy"  cried he rising kneeling and rising again  "I know not how to sustain it a forgiveness such  as thiswhen I believed you must hate me for ever when repulse and aversion were all I dared expectwhen my own inhumanity had bereft thee of thy reasonwhen the grave the pitiless grave was already open to receive thee"  "Too kind too feeling Delvile"  cried the penetrated Cecilia  "relieve your loaded heart from these bitter recollections mine is lightened alreadylightened I think of every thing but its affection for  you  "  "Oh words of transport and extacy"  cried the enraptured Delvile  "oh partner of my life friend solace darling of my bosom that so lately I thought expiring that I folded to my bleeding heart in the agony of eternal separation"  "Come away Sir come away"  cried Dr Lyster who now saw that Cecilia was greatly agitated  "I will not be answerable for the continuation of this scene"  and taking him by the arm he awakened him from his frantic rapture by assuring him she would faint and forced him away from her  Soon after he was gone and Cecilia became more tranquil Henrietta who had wept with bitterness in a corner of the room during this scene approached her and with an attempted smile though in a voice  hardly audible said  "Ah Miss Beverley you will at last then be happy happy as all your goodness deserves And I am sure I should rejoice in it if I was to die to make you happier"  Cecilia who but too well knew her full meaning tenderly embraced her but was prevented by Dr Lyster from entering into any discourse with her  The first meeting however with Delvile being over the second was far more quiet and in a very short time he would scarcely quit her a moment Cecilia herself receiving from his sight a pleasure too great for denial yet too serene for danger  The worthy Dr Lyster finding her prospect of recovery thus fair prepared for leaving London but equally desirous to do good out of his profession as in it he first at the request of Delvile waited upon his father to acquaint him with his present situation solicit his directions for his future proceedings and endeavour to negociate a general reconciliation  Mr Delvile to whose proud heart social joy could find no avenue was yet touched most sensibly by the restoration of Cecilia Neither his dignity nor his displeasure had been able to repress remorse a feeling to which with all his foibles he had not been accustomed The view of  her distraction had dwelt upon his imagination the despondency of his son had struck him with fear and horror He had been haunted by self reproach and pursued by vain regret and those concessions he had refused to tenderness and entreaty he now willingly accorded to change repentance for tranquility He sent instantly for his son whom even with tears he embraced and felt his own peace restored as he pronounced his forgiveness  New however to kindness he retained it not long and a stranger to generosity he knew not how to make her welcome the extinction of his remorse abated his compassion for Cecilia and when solicited to receive her he revived the charges of Mr Monckton  Cecilia informed of this determined to write to that gentleman herself whose long and painful illness joined to his irrecoverable loss of her she now hoped might prevail with him to make reparation for the injuries he had done her  To Mr MONCKTON  I write not Sir to upbraid you the woes which have followed your ill offices and which you may some time hear will  render my reproaches superfluous I write but to beseech that what is past may content you and that however while I was single you chose to misrepresent me to the Delvile family you will have so much honour since I am now become one of it as to acknowledge my innocence of the crimes laid to my charge  In remembrance of my former long friendship I send you my good wishes and in consideration of my hopes from your recantation I send you Sir if you think it worth acceptance my forgiveness  CECILIA DELVILE  Mr Monckton after many long and painful struggles between useless rage and involuntary remorse at length sent the following answer  To Mrs MORTIMER DELVILE  Those who could ever believe you guilty must have been eager to think you so I meant but your welfare at all times and to have saved you from a connection I never thought equal to your merit I am grieved but not surprised to hear of your injuries from the alliance you have formed  nothing else could be expected if my testimony to your innocence can however serve to mitigate them I scruple not to declare I believe it without taint  Delvile sent by Dr Lyster this letter to his father whose rage at the detection of the perfidy which had deceived him was yet inferior to what he felt that his family was mentioned so injuriously  His conference with Dr Lyster was long and painful but decisive that sagacious and friendly man knew well how to work upon his passions and so effectually awakened them by representing the disgrace of his own family from the present situation of Cecilia that before he quitted his house he was authorised to invite her to remove to it  When he returned from his embassy he found Delvile in her room and each waiting with impatience the event of his negociation  The Doctor with much alacrity gave Cecilia the invitation with which he had been charged but Delvile jealous for her dignity was angry and dissatisfied his father brought it not himself and exclaimed with much mortification  "Is this all the grace accorded me"  "Patience patience Sir"  answered the Doctor  "when you have thwarted any body in their first hope and ambition do  you expect they will send you their compliments and many thanks for the disappointment Pray let the good gentleman have his way in some little matters since you have taken such effectual care to put out of his reach the power of having it in greater"  "O far from starting obstacles"  cried Cecilia  "let us solicit a reconciliation with whatever concessions he may require The misery of DISOBEDIENCE we have but too fatally experienced and thinking as we think of filial ties and parental claims how can we ever hope happiness till forgiven and taken into favour"  "True my Cecilia"  answered Delvile  "and generous and condescending as true and if  you  can thus sweetly comply I will gratefully forbear making any opposition Too much already have you suffered from the impetuosity of my temper but I will try to curb it in future by the remembrance of your injuries"  "The whole of this unfortunate business"  said Dr Lyster  "has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE Your uncle the Dean began it by his arbitrary will as if an ordinance of his own could arrest the course of nature and as if  he  had power to keep alive by the loan of a name a family in the male branch already extinct Your father Mr Mortimer continued it  with the same selfpartiality preferring the wretched gratification of tickling his ear with a favourite sound to the solid happiness of his son with a rich and deserving wife Yet this however remember if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your miseries so wonderfully is good and evil balanced that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination for all that I could say to Mr Delvile either of reasoning or entreatyand I said all I could suggest and I suggested all a man need wish to hearwas totally thrown away till I pointed out to him his  own  disgrace in having a  daughterinlaw  immured in these mean lodgings  "Thus my dear young lady the terror which drove you to this house and the sufferings which have confined you in it will prove in the event the source of your future peace for when all my best rhetorick failed to melt Mr Delvile I instantly brought him to terms by coupling his name with a pawnbroker's And he could not with more disgust hear his son called Mr Beverley than think of his son's wife when he hears of the  Three Blue Balls  Thus the same passions taking but different directions  do  mischief and  cure  it alternately  "Such my good young friends is the MORAL of your calamities You have  all in my opinion been strangely at cross purposes and trifled no one knows why with the first blessings of life My only hope is that now having among you thrown away its luxuries you will have known enough of misery to be glad to keep its necessaries"  This excellent man was yet prevailed upon by Delvile to stay and assist in removing the feeble Cecilia to St James'ssquare  Henrietta for whom Mr Arnott's equipage and servants had still remained in town was then though with much difficulty persuaded to go back to Suffolk but Cecilia however fond of her society was too sensible of the danger and impropriety of her present situation to receive from it any pleasure  Mr Delvile's reception of Cecilia was formal and cold yet as she now appeared publicly in the character of his son's wife the best apartment in his house had been prepared for her use his domestics were instructed to wait upon her with the utmost respect and Lady Honoria Pemberton who was accidently in town offered from curiosity what Mr Delvile accepted from parade to be herself in St James'ssquare in order to do honour to his daughterinlaw's first entrance  When Cecilia was a little recovered from  the shock of the first interview and the fatigueof her removal the anxious Mortimer would instantly have had her conveyed to her own apartment but willing to exert herself and hoping to oblige Mr Delvile she declared she was well able to remain some time longer in the drawingroom  "My good friends"  said Dr Lyster  "in the course of my long practice I have found it impossible to study the human frame without a little studying the human mind and from all that I have yet been able to make out either by observation reflection or comparison it appears to me at this moment that Mr Mortimer Delvile has got the best wife and that you Sir have here the most faultless daughterinlaw that any husband or any father in the three kingdoms belonging to his Majesty can either have or desire"  Cecilia smiled Mortimer looked his delighted concurrence Mr Delvile forced himself to make a stiff inclination of the head and Lady Honoria gaily exclaimed  "Dr Lyster when you say the  best  and the most  faultless  you should always add the rest of company excepted"  "Upon my word"  cried the Doctor  "I beg your ladyship's pardon but there is a certain unguarded warmth comes across a man now and then that drives  etiquette  out of his head and makes him speak truth before he well knows where he is"  "O terrible"  cried she  "this is sinking deeper and deeper I had hoped the town air would have taught you better things but I find you have visited at Delvile Castle till you are fit for no other place"  "Whoever Lady Honoria"  said Mr Delvile much offended  "is fit for Delvile Castle must be fit for  every  other place though every other place may by no means be fit for him"  "O yes Sir"  cried she giddily  "every possible place will be fit for him if he can once bear with that Don't you think so Dr Lyster"  "Why when a man has the honour to see your ladyship"  answered he goodhumouredly  "he is apt to think too much of the person to care about the place"  "Come I begin to have some hopes of you"  cried she  "for I see for a Doctor you have really a very pretty notion of a compliment only you have one great fault still you look the whole time as if you said it for a joke"  "Why in fact madam when a man has been a plain dealer both in word and look for upwards of fifty years 'tis expecting too quick a reformation to demand  ductility of voice and eye from him at a blow However give me but a little time and a little encouragement and with such a tutress 'twill be hard if I do not in a very few lessons learn the right method of seasoning a simper and the newest fashion of twisting words from meaning"  "But pray"  cried she  "upon those occasions always remember to look serious Nothing sets off a compliment so much as a long face If you are tempted to an unseasonable laugh think of Delvile Castle 'tis an expedient I commonly make use of myself when I am afraid of being too frisky and it always succeeds for the very recollection of it gives me the headache in a moment Upon my word Mr Delvile you must have the constitution of five men to have kept such good health after living so long at that horrible place You can't imagine how you've surprised me for I have regularly expected to hear of your death at the end of every summer and I assure you once I was very near buying mourning"  "The estate which descends to a man from his own ancestors Lady Honoria"  answered Mr Delvile  "will seldom be apt to injure his health if he is conscious of committing no misdemeanour which has degraded their memory"  "How vastly odious this new father of yours is"  said Lady Honoria in a whisper to Cecilia  "what could ever induce you to give up your charming estate for the sake of coming into his fusty old family I would really advise you to have your marriage annulled You have only you know to take an oath that you were forcibly run away with and as you are an Heiress and the Delviles are all so violent it will easily be credited And then as soon as you are at liberty I would advise you to marry my little Lord Derford"  "Would you only then"  said Cecilia  "have me regain my freedom in order to part with it"  "Certainly"  answered Lady Honoria  "for you can do nothing at all without being married a single woman is a thousand times more shackled than a wife for she is accountable to every body and a wife you know has nothing to do but just to manage her husband"  "And that"  said Cecilia smiling  "you consider as a trifle"  "Yes if you do but marry a man you don't care for"  "You are right then indeed to recommend to me my Lord Derford"  "O yes he will make the prettiest husband in the world you may fly about yourself  as wild as a lark and keep him the whole time as tame as a jackdaw and though he may complain of you to your friends he will never have the courage to find fault to your face But as to Mortimer you will not be able to govern him as long as you live for the moment you have put him upon the fret you'll fall into the dumps yourself hold out your hand to him and losing the opportunity of gaining some material point make up at the first soft word"  "You think then the quarrel more amusing than the reconciliation"  "O a thousand times for while you are quarrelling you may say any thing and demand any thing but when you are reconciled you ought to behave pretty and seem contented"  "Those who presume to have any pretensions to your ladyship"  said Cecilia  "would be made happy indeed should they hear your principles"  "O it would not signify at all"  answered she  "for one's fathers and uncles and those sort of people always make connexions for one and not a creature thinks of our principles till they find them out by our conduct and nobody can possibly do that till we are married for they give us no power beforehand The men know nothing  of us in the world while we are single but how we can dance a minuet or play a lesson upon the harpsichord"  "And what else"  said Mr Delvile who advanced and heard this last speech  "need a young lady of rank desire to be known for your ladyship surely would not have her degrade herself by studying like an artist or professor"  "O no Sir I would not have her study at all it's mighty well for children but really after sixteen and when one is come out one has quite fatigue enough in dressing and going to public places and ordering new things without all that torment of first and second position and E upon the first line and F upon the first space"  "Your ladyship must however pardon me for hinting"  said Mr Delvile  "that a young lady of condition who has a proper sense of her dignity cannot be seen too rarely or known too little"  "O but I hate dignity"  cried she carelessly  "for its the dullest thing in the world I always thought it was owing to that you were so little amusingreally I beg your pardon Sir I meant to say so little talkative"  "I can easily credit that your ladyship spoke hastily"  answered he highly piqued  "for I believe indeed a person of a family such as mine will hardly be supposed to have come into the world for the office of amusing it"  "O no Sir"  cried she with pretended innocence  "nobody I am sure ever saw you with such a thought"  Then turning to Cecilia she added in a whisper  "You cannot imagine my dear Mrs Mortimer how I detest this old cousin of mine Now pray tell me honestly if you don't hate him yourself"  "I hope"  said Cecilia  "to have no reason"  "Lord how you are always upon your guard If I were half as cautious I should die of the vapours in a month the only thing that keeps me at all alive is now and then making people angry for the folks at our house let me go out so seldom and then send me with such stupid old chaperons that giving them a little torment is really the only entertainment I can procure myself Obut I had almost forgot to tell you a most delightful thing"  "What is it"  "Why you must know I have the greatest hopes in the world that my father will quarrel with old Mr Delvile"  "And is that such a delightful thing"  "O yes I have lived upon the very  idea this fortnight for then you know they'll both be in a passion and I shall see which of them looks frightfullest"  "When Lady Honoria whispers"  cried Mortimer  "I always suspect some mischief"  "No indeed"  answered her ladyship  "I was merely congratulating Mrs Mortimer about her marriage Though really upon second thoughts I don't know whether I should not rather condole with her for I have long been convinced she has a prodigious antipathy to you I saw it the whole time I was at Delvile Castle where she used to change colour at the very sound of your name a symptom I never perceived when I talked to her of my Lord Derford who would certainly have made her a thousand times a better husband"  "If you mean on account of his title Lady Honoria"  said Mr Delvile  "your ladyship must be strangely forgetful of the connections of your family not to remember that Mortimer after the death of his uncle and myself must inevitably inherit one far more honourable than a newsprungup family like my Lord Ernolf's could offer"  "Yes Sir but then you know she would have kept her estate which would have been a vastly better thing than an old pedigree of new relations Besides I don't  find that any body cares for the noble blood of the Delviles but themselves and if she had kept her fortune every body I fancy would have cared for  that  "  "Every body then"  said Mr Delvile  "must be highly mercenary and ignoble or the blood of an ancient and honourable house would be thought contaminated by the most distant hint of so degrading a comparison"  "Dear Sir what should we all do with birth if it was not for wealth it would neither take us to Ranelagh nor the Opera nor buy us caps nor wigs nor supply us with dinners nor bouquets"  "Caps and wigs dinners and bouquets"  interrupted Mr Delvile  "your ladyship's estimate of wealth is really extremely minute"  "Why you know Sir as to caps and wigs they are very serious things for we should look mighty droll figures to go about bareheaded and as to dinners how would the Delviles have lasted all these thousand centuries if they had disdained eating them"  "Whatever may be your ladyship's satisfaction"  said Mr Delvile angrily  "in depreciating a house that has the honour of being nearly allied with your own you will not I hope at least instruct this lady"  turning to Cecilia  "to adopt a similar contempt of its antiquity and dignity"  "This lady"  cried Mortimer  "will at least by condescending to become one of it secure us from any danger that such contempt may spread further"  "Let me but"  said Cecilia looking gratefully at him  "be as secure from exciting as I am from feeling contempt and what can I have to wish"  "Good and excellent young lady"  said Dr Lyster  "the first of blessings indeed is yours in the temperance of your own mind When you began your career in life you appeared to us shortsighted mortals to possess more than your share of the good things of this world such a union of riches beauty independence talents education and virtue seemed a monopoly to raise general envy and discontent but mark with what scrupulous exactness the good and bad is ever balanced You have had a thousand sorrows to which those who have looked up to you have been strangers and for which not all the advantages you possess have been equivalent There is evidently throughout this world in things as well as persons a levelling principle at war with preeminence and destructive of perfection"  "Ah"  cried Mortimer in a low voice  to Cecilia  "how much higher must we all rise or how much lower must you fall ere any levelling principle will approximate us with YOU"  He then entreated her to spare her strength and spirits by returning to her own apartment and the conversation was broken up  "Pray permit me Mrs Mortimer"  cried Lady Honoria in taking leave  "to beg that the first guest you invite to Delvile Castle may be me You know my partiality to it already I shall be particularly happy in waiting upon you in tempestuous weather We can all stroll out together you know very sociably and I sha'n't be much in your way for if there should happen to be a storm you can easily lodge me under some great tree and while you amuse yourselves with a têteàtête give me the indulgence of my own reflections I am vastly fond of thinking and being alone you knowespecially in thunder and lightening"  She then ran away and they all separated Cecilia was conveyed up stairs and the worthy Dr Lyster loaded with acknowledgments of every kind set out for the country  Cecilia still weak and much emaciated for some time lived almost wholly in her  own room where the grateful and solicitous attendance of Mortimer alleviated the pain both of her illness and confinement but as soon as her health permitted travelling he hastened with her abroad  Here tranquility once more made its abode the heart of Cecilia that heart so long torn with anguish suspense and horrour Mrs Delvile received her with the most rapturous fondness and the impression of her sorrows gradually wore away from her kind and maternal cares and from the watchful affection and delighted tenderness of her son  The Egglestons now took entire possession of her estate and Delvile at her entreaty forbore shewing any personal resentment of their conduct and put into the hands of a lawyer the arrangement of the affair  They continued abroad some months and the health of Mrs Delvile was tolerably reestablished They were then summoned home by the death of Lord Delvile who bequeathed to his nephew Mortimer his town house and whatever of his estate was not annexed to his title which necessarily devolved to his brother  The sister of Mrs Delvile a woman of high spirit and strong passions lived not long after him but having in her latter  days intimately connected herself with Cecilia she was so much charmed with her character and so much dazzled by her admiration of the extraordinary sacrifice she had made that in a fit of sudden enthusiasm she altered her will to leave to her and to her sole disposal the fortune which almost from his infancy she had destined for her nephew Cecilia astonished and penetrated opposed the alteration but even her sister now Lady Delvile to whom she daily became dearer earnestly supported it while Mortimer delighted to restore to her through his own family any part of that power and independence of which her generous and pure regard for himself had deprived her was absolute in refusing that the deed should be revoked  Cecilia from this flattering transaction received a further conviction of the malignant falsehood of Mr Monckton who had always represented to her the whole of the Delvile family as equally poor in their circumstances and illiberal in their minds The strong spirit of active benevolence which had ever marked her character was now again displayed though no longer as hitherto unbounded She had learnt the error of profusion even in charity and beneficence and she had a motive for oeconomy in her animated affection for Mortimer  She soon sent for Albany whose surprise that she still existed and whose rapture at her recovered prosperity now threatened his senses from the tumult of his joy with nearly the same danger they had lately been menaced by terror But though her donations were circumscribed by prudence and their objects were selected with discrimination she gave to herself all her former benevolent pleasure in solacing his afflictions while she softened his asperity by restoring to him his favourite office of being her almoner and monitor  She next sent to her own pensioners relieved those distresses which her sudden absence had occasioned and renewed and continued the salaries she had allowed them All who had nourished reasonable expectations from her bounty she remembered though she raised no new claimants but with oeconomy and circumspection But neither Albany nor the old pensioners felt the satisfaction of Mortimer who saw with new wonder the virtues of her mind and whose admiration of her excellencies made his gratitude perpetual for the happiness of his lot  The tenderhearted Henrietta in returning to her new friends gave way with artless openness to the violence of untamed grief but finding Mr Arnott as wretched  as herself the sympathy Cecilia had foreseen soon endeared them to each other while the little interest taken in either by Mrs Harrel made them almost inseparable companions  Mrs Harrel wearied by their melancholy and sick of retirement took the earliest opportunity that was offered her of changing her situation she married very soon a man of fortune in the neighbourhood and quickly forgetting all the past thoughtlessly began the world again with new hopes new connectionsnew equipages and new engagements  Henrietta was then obliged to go again to her mother where though deprived of all the indulgencies to which she was now become familiar she was not more hurt by the separation than Mr Arnott So sad and so solitary his house seemed in her absence that he soon followed her to town and returned not till he carried her back its mistress And there the gentle gratitude of her soft and feeling heart engaged from the worthy Mr Arnott the tenderest affection and in time healed the wound of his early and hopeless passion  The injudicious the volatile yet nobleminded Belfield to whose mutable and enterprising disposition life seemed always rather beginning than progressive roved from employment to employment and from  public life to retirement soured with the world and discontented with himself till vanquished at length by the constant friendship of Delvile he consented to accept his good offices in again entering the army and being fortunately ordered out upon foreign service his hopes were revived by ambition and his prospects were brightened by a view of future honour  The wretched Monckton dupe of his own cunning and artifices still lived in lingering misery doubtful which was most acute the pain of his wound and confinement or of his defeat and disappointment Led on by a vain belief that he had parts to conquer all difficulties he had indulged without restraint a passion in which interest was seconded by inclination Allured by such fascinating powers he shortly suffered nothing to stop his course and though when he began his career he would have started at the mention of actual dishonour long before it was concluded neither treachery nor perjury were regarded by him as stumbling blocks All fear of failing was lost in vanity all sense of probity was sunk in interest all scruples of conscience were left behind by the heat of the chace Yet the unforeseen and melancholy catastrophe of his long arts illustrated in his despite what his principles had obscured  that even in worldly pursuits where fraud outruns integrity failure joins dishonour to loss and disappointment excites triumph instead of pity  The upright mind of Cecilia her purity her virtue and the moderation of her wishes gave to her in the warm affection of Lady Delvile and the unremitting fondness of Mortimer all the happiness human life seems capable of receivingyet human it was and as such imperfect she knew that at times the whole family must murmur at her loss of fortune and at times she murmured herself to be thus portionless tho' an HEIRESS Rationally however she surveyed the world at large and finding that of the few who had any happiness there were none without some misery she checked the rising sigh of repining mortality and grateful with general felicity bore partial evil with chearfullest resignation
