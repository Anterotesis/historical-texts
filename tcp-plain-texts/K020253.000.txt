 REMARKS ON A PRINTED PAPER LATELY HANDED ABOUT INTITULED  A Catalogue of the Sacred Vessels restored by  Cy∣rus  and of the  Chief Jews  who returned at first from the Captivity together with the Names of the returning  Families  and the  Number  of the Persons at that Time in each Family Disposed in such a Manner as to shew most clearly the great Cor∣ruption of  Proper Names  and  Numbers  in the pre∣sent Text of the OldTestament  Addressed to all such GENTLEMEN as have received or read the same  THE SECOND EDITION  By GRANVILLE SHARP  LONDON Printed for B WHITE at HORACE'SHEAD FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXV  REMARKS ON A PRINTED PAPER  c  GENTLEMEN  HAVING received from a worthy Friend in the country for whom I have the greatest esteem a printed paper which had been sent him by Dr Kennicott intituled  A Cata∣logue of the  Sacred Vessels  restored by  Cyrus  and of the  Chief Jews  who re∣turned at first from the Captivity to∣gether with the Names of the return∣ing  Families  and the  Number  of the Persons at that Time in each Family disposed in such a manner as to shew  most clearly the great corruption of  Proper Names  and  Numbers  in the pre∣sent Text of the OldTestament  and being desired to return the said paper when I had perused it I thought I could not handsomely do so without sending my opinion of it at the same time The nature of the subject is indeed so foreign to my own business and way of life that I should scarcely have presumed to med∣dle with it had not a point of good man∣ners to this Gentleman first of all induced me to do so but afterwards when I had considered Dr Kennicott's manner of ex∣pressing himself in the title of this cata∣logue I thought myself obliged through a desire of vindicating the Holy Scrip∣tures to apply as closely to the examina∣tion of this charge against them as my small share of leisure would permit be∣ing apprehensise that this paper might cause such prejudices against the integrity of the Text of the OldTestament as the  learned Author himself perhaps never conceived and would be sorry to have occasioned by his catalogue  The Letter to my friend which was the result of this examination was at my desire shewn to Dr Kennicott but the arguments therein had not sufficient weight to convince him that some apo∣logy was necessary to be made to his friends to prevent their misinterpreting his real design in the said catalogue and to remove all appearance of his having charged  the present Text of the OldTes∣tament  with more faults than it really deserves Not being able however to lay aside my own apprehensions of the ill ef∣fects which might possibly be occasioned by this catalogue I have therefore ven∣tured to print some of my remarks upon it lest any person not having leisure to examine it sufficiently should be led to conceive that all the differences in  names and numbers found therein are really corruptions  in the present Text of the OldTestament  In the first part of the Catalogue the Doctor has compared Ezra's account of the sacred vessels with the account given of the same in the Book of Esdras and as if he had  clearly shewn  thereby some great corruptions he has affixed the fol∣lowing motto to his quotations viz  non potest verum asseri quod  In the letter which I sent to my friend on this subject I endeavoured to shew that a disagreement in numbers when the accounts of historians are compa∣red is not a sufficient authority to justify a charge of corruption and I supposed an example of two histori∣ans giving an account of the number of slain in a battle the one that men were killed and the other that no less than were lost in the same battle and I observed that if the account is true of being killed the other account cannot be called a contradic∣tion to it because a less number is mentioned there∣in and this I thought sufficient to exemplify that a smaller number when given  without an absolute limita∣tion  is no contradiction to a greater number But it has been objected to this example that it is  by no means parallel to the case in question because the numbers of slain in battle in large armies as given by Historians  are from the nature  of the thing hardly ever to be depended upon where∣as when an inventory of goods is given it is reasonably sup∣posed to be exact to an unit because it easily may be so  I will therefore mention another example not liable to the same objection and more proper to be inserted in these remarks because it is quoted by Dr  Kennicott  see page of his st dissertation viz  In    Kings  iv  we read that Solomon had    stalls for horses but in    Chr  ix  only    This Dr  Kennicott  men∣tions as one of the instances of  mistakes  which  are most easilyaccounted for by admitting the addition omission or transposition of a cypher  and the Doctor's favourite Author Father  Houbigant  thinks to remove all difficul∣ty from the same by altering the Text in  Kings  iv from  to  viz from to  But the ingenious Author of a small MS book lent me by a worthy and learned friend to whom I have great obligation on this as well as many other ac∣counts makes it appear very plainly that the opinions of  Bochart  and  Lud Capellus  who think the word  instead of should be translated would cause greater difficulties than what are at present found in the Text for says he  let this Rabbinical use of plural ordinal numbers be what they please yet in the Scripture Style they are never taken singular∣ly and this I affirm after having examined some hundreds of places where they are either joined with appellatives persons or things or greater numbers as an hundred or thousand and so these  Hebrew  words  signify be∣yond exception in all other Texts they are found in and so the LXX turn them here and  Josephus  pre∣serves the same high number  He then proceeds to shew the great probability  from the Riches and Gran∣deur of Solomon  and the more terrible execution a  Quadriga  would make than a  Biga  that  Solomon  's Chariots were drawn by horses which opinion he supports by a variety of quotations and learned argu∣ments and afterwards observes that as  Solomon  had Chariots  Kings  x and  Chron  i the number of horses allowing to each chariot would require Stalls besides the Stalls necessary for the single Troop Horses which numbers will oc∣casion great difficulties if we suppose that  Solomon  had only Stalls He also observes that besides the Stalls necessary for  Solomon  's standing forces standings were necessary for horses presented to him by foreign Princes as also for Baggage Mules and Dromedaries which must be very numerous not only for the carriage of provisions tents and other warlike necessaries both for horse and foot but also for water in the vast sandy wild of Arabia Deserta as far as Euphrates Moreover he observes that as Solomon trafficked by his mer∣chants with horses brought out of Egypt furnishing the Kings of Syria and the Hittites  so this running trade might occasion these stalls to be so numerous not on∣ly serving the purposes of war but of traffick  Many more reasons are given by the same Author which are confirmed by a great variety of learned quotations and authorities but I trust that those few I have men∣tioned are quite sufficient to prove that Father  Houbi∣gant  has been much too hasty in altering the Sacred Text from to and that he has thereby loaded it with a real difficulty when he might have avoided the imaginary one by admitting a very rea∣sonable and fair solution which has been approved of by a great variety of learned commentators I mean that of construing the word  not Stalls but Stables which intirely removes all the difficulty for supposing each Stable capable of containing Horses you very easily account for the number of Stalls and this opinion is approved of by Abarbinel Junius and Tremellius Bp Patrick Sir Walter Raleigh Mons Martin and a great variety of other Commen∣tators  Some have indeed supposed that the chariot Horses spoken of in the parallel passage in d Chronicles ix were but which King Solomon kept at or near Jerusalem for his constant guard and that the other speaks of those which were dispersed throughout his whole kingdom  But what is most material to my purpose is observed by the author of the little treatise abovementioned viz  the diversity between these two relations  viz in Kings iv and Chron ix amounts to but if the first account is proved true  which he most clearly has done  the second must be so too as the less is included in the greater number  Now this is the very conclusion that I drew from my former example viz of the two historians giving dif∣ferent accounts of the number of men slain in a battle which was objected to and this is another reason for my having quoted this example of Solomon's Horses and I have the more pleasure in doing so because it is not liable to the same objection as the former for the numbers therein may as  reasonably be supposed to be exact to a unit  as the account of any  other inventory  whatever because it easily might have been so we find likewise that the difficulty therein may reasonably be accounted for without the supposition of a  mistake  or the necessity of having recourse to Father Houbigant's dangerous and unwarrantable expedient of altering the text  ita diversum est  But this account of Esdras is not  ita diversum  as to amount to a contra∣diction  of the other and therefore the doctor's motto is not at all applicable  For  Ezra  might at one time make particu∣lar mention of such Vessels only as were  perhaps  A very apt and ingenious objection has been made to this argument and communicated to the writer of these Remarks who hopes that the worthy and learned Author will excuse his inserting it here at length as the omission of it in this place might per∣haps be deemed an injustice to the subject in question The Objection was as follows  That Ezra did not mean to mention particularly the chief vessels only and then to include the rest in the general round Sum is evident from hence that he does do this be∣fore he comes to make up the Sum for he throws together all the Vessels not before specified under the article  other Vessels  and into the general round Sum and this round Sum added to the particular Sums before specified ought in common sense to make the Sum total which here it does not do  But notwithstanding the seeming propriety of this objection yet while there is any reasonable way left of accounting for a difficulty we ought to be very cau∣tious of supposing a corruption not from any idea of the  absolute Integrity  of the Hebrew Text but because many very learned and experienced persons have led themselves and others into errors by esteeming some difficult passages to be corrupt when the truth and in∣tegrity of the same might have been very sufficiently vindicated  In the present case though I have not met with any thing which in my opinion ought to be adopted as the only true interpretation yet I think that one of the solutions given by Bp Patrick is so far reasonable that it removes the absolute necessity of supposing a corrup∣tion  viz  It is said in  Chron xxxvi  Nebu∣chadnezzar carried away all the vessels both great and small Now in the account that is here given the larger vessels only which were of greater bigness and price are mentioned  Among which are also reckoned the other Vessels which  round Sum  was not inten∣ded to make up the gross but only to include all the other  great  or  larger Vessels  the species of which were not particularized as Josephus testifies  And other  great  Vessels a thousand        But the gross Sum compre∣hends all both great and small and amounts to the num∣ber    chiefly used or were most remarkable and might mean to include  all the rest in the  general round  Sum of and yet might afterwards think  proper to write a more circumstantial history setting down the  exact  number of each kind of vessel together with the  particular  amount or total of the whole  In  Josephus  the  and the  correspond very well with the chargers of gold and basons of gold mentioned by  Ezra  As to the other numbers they all differ as well from the account in  Ezra  as from that in  Esdras  except the other vessels and the addition of the whole amounts to no more than yet as he has not himself given a total number he cannot be said to contradict either of the others Now as not one of the articles in the  Heb  account of  Ezra  exceeds the numbers of those in  Esdras  there can be no contradiction therein because each number may be  included in the corresponding number in  Esdras  And farther if the number of each article in  Ezra  had been exactly the same with those in  Esdras  the  Sum To∣tal  would have appeared more like a mistake but as they amount to no more than it is plain that the writer did not mean to enumerate every single vessel because he afterwards gives a  round  Sum Total of  even Hundreds  viz which is more frequent in Histo∣rians than exact and particular sums therefore a person must be very little ac∣quainted with History who supposes that this is a contradiction to the Sum Total in  Esdras  because  the odd number  is omitted  This numerical exactness in the Account of Es∣dras which is wanting in the Hebrew Account has occasioned a supposition that the latter by some means or other has undergone some alteration But it must be observed that some ancient copies of the book of Es∣dras have been  equally exact  in making the Sum total the amount of the several sorts of vessels to a unit not∣withstanding that the particulars are very different and that the Sum total exceeds the common reading by vessels The old Latin Bibles from which the present Vulgate was taken have the reading just mentioned which was probably translated from MSS as ancient as those from which the present Greek Text of Esdras was taken and the same reading is found in Tindal's old English Bible printed in Therefore this numerical exactness is not a sufficient proof of the au∣thenticity of the book of Esdras in this place so that if the Heb of Ezra was to be corrected by it to the same numerical exactness and if  such other  corrections as have been proposed were to take place in the Text of the OldTestament I am apt to think that our Ho∣ly Bible itself would soon by too many be esteemed as little better than apocryphal    As to the difference of the names by which the Vessels are called however unlike they appear in the  English  Tran∣slation yet whoever is acquainted with the original Text must know that they correspond sufficiently except indeed the  Heb  word which is translated  knives  and that is capable of being construed several different ways but there is not  the least reason to suppose that it has been corrupted  The next thing that I have to observe is that Dr  K  has been particularly un∣fortunate in fixing upon this part of the sacred History as a proof of  the great cor∣ruption of the proper names and numbers in the present Text of the OldTestament  First  Because it was the custom of the  Ba∣bylonians  to give new Names to their cap∣tives so that it was very common a∣mong the  Jewish  Captives to be called by two names of this the Book of  Daniel  gives sufficient proof and therefore this difference is of the less consequence be∣cause two different names may mean the same person  And Secondly because these three Books all agree in the sum total of per∣sons  This agreement of the three Books in the sum total of Persons has occasioned a supposition  that the Catalogue in all three was originally the same and that all three are now imperfect in some of the parti∣culars since the particulars in none of them now amount to the sum which is said to be the sum of each  But there is no proof that the list which Nehemiah found was exactly the same with that from which Ezra copied for many different ac∣counts might have been taken by the Persons appoint∣ed to number the people even under the same title of  the Children of the Province that went up out of Captivity  c and though they might find it very easy to agree in the sum total  even to a unit  by reckoning the peo∣ple promiscuously by fifties hundreds or thousands in which method the want of pedigrees would cause no difficulty yet in taking the numbers of the families se∣parately they might be very liable to differ on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the legitimacy of some particular persons in many of the said Families  It must be observed too that not one of the three lists mentions the number of Priests who were rejected for want of proper Registers though the names of their fa∣milies are the very last in each list just preceding the Sum total so that there is no doubt but that they are included therein notwithstanding therefore as the consent of all three informs us beyond contradiction of the real Sum total so the want of the number of these Priests  in all three lists  seems  as clearly  to prove that the particular numbers in each were  not intended  to make up exactly the said Sum total because it must otherwise seem very unaccountable that  all these three Lists  as well as  all the ancient versions which have been made from them  should happen to be corrupted  in the same identical place  Dr Kennicott seemed to be aware of this objection when he first  published  his Catalogue of names in his second Dissertation page c for he has there omitted these three last names which have no num∣bers specified though he has thought fit to add them to his second Edition in the printed sheet because he must have been convinced that they ought to be in∣cluded in the Sum total notwithstanding the triple evidence of these Lists that  no number ought to be added to the same  and consequently that the exact number was never intended to be made appear from the addition of the particular Sums in any of these Lists  viz and yet none of their accounts amount to that sum by  upwards of  so that were the names and numbers which are particularized in each book much more different than they really are they could not with jus∣tice be accused of contradiction because there is sufficient room left  in any  of these histories for the mention of  many different Families  which might have been omit∣ted by the others  Now those who content themselves with the Doctor's Catalogue without farther examination may indeed ima∣gine that he has shewn them  most clear∣ly  some great corruptions of proper names  c  because he has  disposed them in such a manner  as to compare the name  Bezai  in  Ezra  with  Hashum  in  Nehemiah  and again  Jorah  in  Ezra  with  Bezai  in  Nehemiah  which should have been placed in the line above also  Hashum  in  Ezra  which should have been placed two lines higher with  Hariph  in  Nehemiah  Likewise he has placed  Lod  opposite to  Jericho Hadid  to  Lod Ono  to  Hadid  and  Jericho  to  Ono  each in a wrong line So that he must either allow this to be a great mistake or else that these names are  "disposed in such a manner"  as to prove nothing at all of what he pre∣tends  By way of excuse for Dr Kennicott it has been urged that the names are taken in the order in which they stand in each writer to shew how the order of the original Catalogue has been disturbed and that he did not intend to compare those names which are mani∣festly different as if meant for the same person but as no sufficient evidence has ever yet been produced that the order of the names has really been disturbed in any of the Lists from what it was when written by the Authors of each and as I have in a former note shewn a probability that the Catalogue in all three Lists  was not originally exactly the same  and as this seems to be proved by these very variations in the or∣der of the names therefore I think that the Doctor's  manner of disposing  the names cannot with justice be de∣fended    At the head of the names the Doctor has placed a Title  viz "The Twelve Chief Men"  by which people may un∣warily be led to suppose that the chief men were confined to the limited num∣ber of Twelve but the Scriptures make no mention of a limited number of Chief Men  Dr Kennicott nevertheless informs us in page Second Dissertation that the  twelve Chiefs  re∣presented the  twelve Tribes  but only of names therefore it is not an inconsistency in the account of  Ezra  to mention only Eleven names On this account likewise the difference in the names is of less consequence be∣cause it is not easy to prove that different persons were not intended to have been  expressed thereby on the other hand it may be as difficult to prove that they were though there is some appearance of a proof in one instance  viz  the names  Reelius  and  Roimus  in  Esdras  if we consider the  Greek  manner of ex∣pressing  Hebrew  names will answer very well to  Reelaiah    in  Ezra  and  Raamiah    in  Nehemiah  which last names Dr K has compared together as supposing them to have been originally the same though the similar names just mentioned in  Esdras  give us great reason to believe the contrary  But before I leave Dr Kennicott's twelve Chief Men I will endeavour to clear up another difficulty and will now take his side of the question to prove that he has done right in comparing  Re∣hum  in Ezra with  Nehum  in Nehemiah as the name of one man notwithstand∣ing the great difference between them in  sound which may at first sight seem to favour my suggestion about different per∣sons and I shall have the more pleasure in doing this because at the same time I shall  shew most clearly  that neither the one nor the other is corrupted Now every person who is tolerably acquainted with the Chaldee and Syriac tongues must know that N  is frequently changed for R  in words derived from the Hebrew and therefore it is much more easy to believe that Nehemiah like a Babylonian wrote  for    Nehum  for  Rehum  than to sup∣pose that either of the words has been since corrupted  Whatever difference there may be be∣tween Ezra and Nehemiah in numbers which are of less consequence as both of them fall so far short of the total yet the difference in names is very imma∣terial though Dr Kennicott has  dis∣posed  them in such a manner  as to make it seem very considerable  There is but  one name  viz Hariph in all this  long list of Families  mentioned by Nehemiah which has any material difference from those mentioned by Ezra and there are  but four names  in Ezra viz  Jorah Magbish Hagab  and  Asnah  which are not found in Nehemiah therefore as there are no names in Ne∣hemiah to compare with these last ex∣cepting the single name  Hariph  it is im∣possible for Dr K to prove  any corrup∣tion of names in the Hebrew text through∣out this whole list of families  Perhaps the Doctor may imagine that the difference of names in the Apocry∣phal Greek book of Esdras is a sufficient proof against the integrity of the Hebrew text of the other two otherwise he must allow that his Catalogue proves very  little in this article of names But sup∣posing that these differences were real contradictions which they are not the suspicion of corruption must of course fall on the book of  See Dr Kennicott's second Dissertation on the State of the Hebrew Text pages and where he intirely gives up the authority of the Book of Es∣dras so that its testimony ought to have but very little weight especially with Dr K himself in correcting the Text  Esdras First Because the two best Greek copies of this same book viz the Vatican and Alexandrian copies differ very much from each other both in the names and numbers  Secondly Because it is not of equal au∣thority with the others being apocry∣phal and therefore not received into the canon of the Scriptures  And Thirdly Because two evidences against one though they were all to be of equal authority would undoubtedly gain the cause in this critical trial  But I will now endeavour to shew that even the apocryphal Book of Esdras is not so widely different from the others as the Doctor has made them appear in his Ca∣talogue and of this I hope the few ex∣amples that follow will be a sufficient proof  Verse  Aterezias  is in the original Greek  agreeable to the Hebrew  AterHezekiah  Verse  Bethsamos  is  in the Alexandrian copy which is very agreeable to the Hebrew of Nehemiah  Bithozmouth  or  Bethazma∣veth  Verse  Gabdes  is  the ge∣nitive of  agreeable to the He∣brew  Gaba  Verse  Annaas  is  agree∣able to the Hebrew  Senaah  Ver  Carme  appears very different from  Harim  in English though they are in the original tongues apparently the same word for the H in  Harim    in  being a rough aspirate is fre∣quently expressed by the  in Greek as    Verse  Jatal  is  in the ori∣ginal Greek agreeable to the Hebrew  Also  Teta  is  which agrees very well with the Hebrew  Hatita  Sami  is  in the Vatican copy which agrees very well with the Hebrew  Shobai  for  by the Chaldaeans and Sy∣rians was frequently exchanged both for  and  likewise the word  as it is expressed in the Alexandrian copy is agreeable to the Hebrew    Verse  Graba  is  in the Vatican copy and  in the Alex∣andrian  agreeable to the Hebrew  Haga∣ba  Verse  Acua  is  in the Greek which is much nearer to  Akkub  Verse  Airus  should be  which is plainly derived from  Reaiah by prefixing the  or I a thing very common in Hebrew names  Azia  should be  which very well corres∣ponds with  called in English  Uzza  Verse  Charcus  in the original is in the genitive  and agrees well with  Barkos  Nasith  is in the Vatican copy  which is sufficiently near to  Neziah  Verse  Azaphion  is in the Alexan∣drian copy  which is much nearer to  Sophereth  Pharira  is in the Alexandrian copy  agreeable to the Hebrew  Perida  though the Greek  expresses the  without dagesch  Verse  Addus  The Doctor has had very little regard  to the context  or he would not have placed this name oppo∣site to  Barzillai  in order to  shew clearly a great corruption  for he might have been there informed that Addus mar∣ried Augia one of the daughters of  Ber∣zelus and was named after his name  The word  in the Vatican copy is rendered  Berzelus  for the Chal∣daeans frequently changed the Hebrew  into  or    I shall now endeavour to give you some proofs that Dr Kennicott has con∣demned the proper names and numbers of the  present Text of the OldTestament  as being  greatly corrupt  without giving  himself the trouble for any thing that appears in the catalogue to the contrary even to examine the original text and that he has contented himself with set∣ting down the names and numbers mere∣ly as they occurred in the English tran∣slation  This is not less injustice than if a judge were to condemn a prisoner merely from the report given of him by others with∣out permitting him to appear before him to answer for himself  My proofs of the Doctor's having mere∣ly copied the English Version I shall take out of the book of Esdras because with that I suppose he meant to cor∣rect the Hebrew Text  Verse He has taken the name  Sadas  and the number only from the English version for in the Alexan∣drian  copy it is  near to the He∣brew  Azgad  and  in the Vatican copy so that he trifles with the originals if he thinks in this manner to shew their corruptions  Verse He has placed the number to Adonicam as in the English Ver∣sion of Esdras whereas the Vatican copy reads and the Alexandrian  Verse  Ananias  is called  and  in the original Greek  Meterus  is expressed by  in the original Greek  Verse  Phasseron  in the English Version and the Doctor's catalogue has the number but in the Vatican copy it has and in the Alexandri∣an  Carme  as in the English Ver∣sion whereas the Vatican copy has only and the Alexandrian  Verse  Ladan  as in the English which is  in the original  Lastly the number of servants is plainly a mistake copied from the Eng∣lish Version for the original Greek as well as the Syriac Version of the same is agreeable to the Hebrew  Now as many of the seeming differ∣ences which the reader as Dr Ken∣nicott supposes in page d Disser∣tation will view with surprize are not to be found in the original but are oc∣casioned by the Doctor's copying merely from the English Version as many other differences in names are caused only by the changing of letters according to the common Chaldaean mode of expressing Hebrew words and therefore are not liable to the charge of corruption and as the most material differences between Ezra and Nehemiah are made by the Doc∣tor's having placed the names in the or∣der  in which they stand in each writer which has caused him to compare names manifestly different as if meant for the same person so I must conclude all these things considered that not only the disposition of names but the whole per∣formance is intirely unfair because the Doctor's motto leaves no room for allow∣ances to be made for whatever may have occasioned the several seeming differences but condemns them indiscriminately with a bold insinuation of falsehood viz  Non potest verum asseri quod ita diversum est  The Doctor in his printed Sheet has indeed placed this motto close by the side of his quotation from the apocryphal Book of  Esdras  but it is plain that he intended thereby to censure the differ∣ences in the whole catalogue because he prefixed the same unjust motto to his  first publication  of the Catalogue in his d Dissertation p  I call this motto unjust not only be∣cause it is there applied indiscriminately to a quotation from two canonical Books of the OldTestament but because St  Jerome  's authority is quoted for it as if he had applied the same words for the same purpose to the Book of  Ezra  though it appears very plainly by St  Je∣rome  's preface to the said Book that he was speaking only of differences in the various copies of  the Greek Version  when he made use of those words  But notwithstanding the many faults which I have found in the writings of this Gentleman yet I have a much bet∣ter opinion of him than to suppose that he will ever endeavour to evade my cen∣sure of his Catalogue by alledging that he did not mean by it to shew the corrup∣tions of the original Text but only of the common  English  Translation which he has here copied word for word and  that he meant the  English  Translation where he has mentioned  the present Text of the Old Testament  I say notwithstanding the improbabi∣lity that there is of the Doctor's ever seeking such an evasion yet he must ex∣cuse me if I endeavour to guard against any sort of shiftingoff from the point whatsoever  Therefore I must observe that the Text of any author cannot mean  a Tran∣slation  especially when a person is speak∣ing of corruptions in it for the Corrup∣tion of any Text must mean some wilful or accidental alteration from the original copy of the Author  No Person therefore speaking concern∣ing the corruption in a Translation of any Book may say that they are corruptions of the  present Text  of the said book be∣cause  at the same time perhaps the real and original text contains none of those faults which he complains of  So that should the Doctor have really only meant to expose some defects which he might imagine he had discovered in the  English  Version though I cannot think that he intended any such thing by this Catalogue yet it must appear to the Eyes of all those who know him and his pre∣sent undertaking as if these unjust cen∣sures were levelled at the Original Text itself  There are many other things I believe which might be alledged against this Ca∣talogue but I shall only beg leave to trouble the reader with two more  Though there might be many  Jewish  Families called after the names of places as  Bethlehem Ramah Jericho  c yet  perhaps Dr  K  may have difficulty to prove that any  Jewish  Families were called  Telmelah Telharsa Cherub  and  Addan    Immer  the next name being indeed an exception although he has placed them in his list of families under the running Title of  "The Children of"  Now if he had attended to the context even of the  English  Translation he might have understood that these were really the names of places and not of families for we are there informed that the Families afterwards mentioned  which  went up from  the said places  sought their register among those that were rec∣koned by genealogy but they were not found  Another mistake he has likewise made in comparing  Cherub  and  Addan  the names of  places  in  Ezra  and  Nehemiah  with  Charaathalar  and  Aalar  the names  of men  mentioned by  Esdras  though the context plainly shews that there were no other than what I say  I will not however insist on these two last articles because I presume that I have before sufficiently proved that this Cata∣logue  does  not shew most clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the present Text of the OldTestament  Now lest my censure of this catalogue should seem to strike obliquely at Dr Kennicott's present undertaking of col∣lating the Heb MSS which has been honoured with the subscriptions of so many great and learned persons I think it necessary for my own sake as well as in justice to Dr Kennicott to declare that I think his collation of Hebrew MSS a very laudable and use∣ful undertaking and that there cannot be the least objection to his new Edi∣tion  of the Heb Bible if printed ac∣cording to the proposals offered by him in the year viz  not with a new Text  but  from one of the best Edi∣tions already published  having the various readings inserted at the bottom of every page  I am Gentlemen
