THEY order said I this matter better in France  You have been in France said my gentleman turning quick upon me with the most civil triumph in the worldStrange quoth I debating the matter with myself That one and twenty miles sailing for 'tis absolutely no further from Dover to Calais should give a man these  rightsI'll look into them so giving up the argumentI went straight to my lodgings put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breeches  " the coat I have on said I looking at the sleeve will do"  took a place in the Dover stage and the packet sailing at nine the next morningby three I had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricassee'd chicken so incontestably in France that had I died that night of an indigestion the whole world could not have suspended the effects of the  All the effects of strangers Swiss and Scotch excepted dying in France are seized by virtue of this law tho' the heir be upon the spotthe profit of these contingencies being farm'd there is no redress  Droits  d'aubaine  my shirts and black pair of silk breechesportmanteau and all must have gone to the King of Franceeven the little picture which I have so long worn and so often have told thee Eliza I would carry with me into my grave would have been torn from my neckUngenerousto seize upon the wreck of an unwary passenger whom your subjects had beckon'd to their coastby heaven SIRE it is not well done and much does it grieve me 'tis the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous and so renown'd for sentiment and fine feelings that I have to reason with  But I have scarce set foot in your dominions  CALAIS  WHEN I had finish'd my dinner and drank the King of France's health to satisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen but on the contrary high honour for the humanity of his temperI rose up an inch taller for the accommodation  Nosaid Ithe Bourbon is by no means a cruel race they may be misled like other people but there is a mildness in their blood As I acknowledged this I felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheekmore warm and friendly to man than  what Burgundy at least of two livres a bottle which was such as I had been drinking could have produced  Just God said I kicking my portmanteau aside what is there in this world's goods which should sharpen our spirits and make so many kindhearted brethren of us fall out so cruelly as we do by the way  When man is at peace with man how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metals in his hand he pulls out his purse and holding it airily and uncompress'd looks round him as if he sought for an object to share it withIn doing this I felt  every vessel in my frame dilatethe arteries beat all chearily together and every power which sustained life perform'd it with so little friction that 'twould have confounded the most  physical precieuse  in France with all her materialism she could scarce have called me a machine  I'm confident said I to myself I should have overset her creed  The accession of that idea carried nature at that time as high as she could goI was at peace with the world before and this finish'd the treaty with myself  Now was I a King of France cried Iwhat a moment for an orphan to have begg'd his father's portmanteau of me  THE MONK  CALAIS  I HAD scarce utter'd the words when a poor monk of the order of St Francis came into the room to beg something for his convent No man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingenciesor one man may be generous as another man is puissant  sed non quo ad hanc  or be it as it mayfor there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours they may depend upon the same causes for ought I know which influence the tides themselves'twould oft be no discredit  to us to suppose it was so I'm sure at least for myself that in many a case I should be more highly satisfied to have it said by the world  "I had had an affair with the moon in which there was neither sin nor shame"  than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed wherein there was so much of both  But be this as it may The moment I cast my eyes upon him I was predetermined not to give him a single sous and accordingly I put my purse into my pocketbutton'd it upset myself a little more upon my centre and advanced up gravely to him there was something I fear forbidding in my look I have his  figure this moment before my eyes and think there was that in it which deserved better  The monk as I judged from the break in his tonsure a few scatter'd white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it might be about seventybut from his eyes and that sort of fire which was in them which seemed more temper'd by courtesy than years could be no more than sixtyTruth might lie betweenHe was certainly sixtyfive and the general air of his countenance notwithstanding something seem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time agreed to the account  It was one of those heads which Guido has often paintedmild palepenetrating free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earthit look'd forwards but look'd as if it look'd at something beyond this world How one of his order came by it heaven above who let it fall upon a monk's shoulders best knows but it would have suited a Bramin and had I met it upon the plains of Indostan I had reverenced it  The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes one might put it into the hands of any one to design for 'twas neither elegant or  otherwise but as character and expression made it so it was a thin spare form something above the common size if it lost not the distinction by a bend forwards in the figurebut it was the attitude of Intreaty and as it now stands presented to my imagination it gain'd more than it lost by it  When he had enter'd the room three paces he stood still and laying his left hand upon his breast a slender white staff with which he journey'd being in his rightwhen I had got close up to him he introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent and the poverty of his orderand did it with  so simple a graceand such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figureI was bewitch'd not to have been struck with it  A better reason was I had predetermined not to give him a single sous  THE MONK  CALAIS  'TIS very true said I replying to a cast upwards with his eyes with which he had concluded his address'tis very trueand heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world the stock of which I fear is no way sufficient for the many  great claims  which are hourly made upon it  As I pronounced the words  great claims  he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve  of his tunickI felt the full force of the appealI acknowledge it said Ia coarse habit and that but once in three years with meagre dietare no great matters and the true point of pity is as they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry that your order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame the blind the aged and the infirmthe captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions languishes also for his share of it and had you been of the  order of mercy  instead of the order of St Francis poor as I am continued I pointing at my portmanteau full chearfully should it have been open'd  to you for the ransom of the unfortunateThe monk made me a bowbut of all others resumed I the unfortunate of our own country surely have the first rights and I have left thousands in distress upon our own shoreThe monk gave a cordial wave with his headas much as to say No doubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world as well as within our conventBut we distinguish said I laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick in return for his appealwe distinguish my good Father betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labourand those who eat the bread of other people's and have no other plan in life but to get  through it in sloth and ignorance  for the love of God  The poor Franciscan made no reply a hectic of a moment pass'd across his cheek but could not tarryNature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him he shewed nonebut letting his staff fall within his arm he press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast and retired  THE MONK  CALAIS  MY heart smote me the moment he shut the doorPsha said I with an air of carelessness three several timesbut it would not do every ungracious syllable I had utter'd crouded back into my imagination I reflected I had no right over the poor Franciscan but to deny him and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed without the addition of unkind languageI consider'd his grey hairshis courteous figure seem'd to reenter and gently ask me what injury he had done meand why I could  use him thusI would have given twenty livres for an advocateI have behaved very ill said I within myself but I have only just set out upon my travels and shall learn better manners as I get along  THE DESOBLIGEANT  CALAIS  WHEN a man is discontented with himself it has one advantage however that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaiseand nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire something of that kind to my purpose an old  A chaise so called in France from its bolding but one person  Desobligeant in the furthest corner of the court hit my fancy at first sight so I instantly got into it  and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings I ordered the waiter to call Monsieur Dessein the master of the hôtelbut Monsieur Dessein being gone to vespers and not caring to face the Franciscan whom I saw on the opposite side of the court in conference with a lady just arrived at the innI drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us and being determined to write my journey I took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface to it in the  Disobligeant  PREFACE IN THE DESOBLIGEANT  IT must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher That nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease and to sustain his sufferings at home It is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy  for one pair of shoulders 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond  her  limits but 'tis so ordered that from the want of languages connections and dependencies and from the difference in education customs and habits we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere as often amount to a total impossibility  It will always follow from hence that the balance of sentimental commerce is always against the expatriated adventurer he must buy what he has little occasion for at their own pricehis conversation  will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discountand this by the by eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable brokers for such conversation as he can find it requires no great spirit of divination to guess at his party  This brings me to my point and naturally leads me if the seesaw of this  Desobligeant  will but let me get on into the efficient as well as the final causes of travelling  Your idle people that leave their native country and go abroad for some reason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes  Infirmity of body  Imbecility of mind or  Inevitable necessity  The first two include all those who travel by land or by water labouring with pride curiosity vanity or spleen subdivided and combined  in infinitum  The third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs more especially those travellers who set out upon their travels with the benefit of the clergy either as delinquents travelling under the direction of governors recommended by the magistrateor young gentlemen transported by the cruelty of parents and guardians and travelling under the direction of governors recommended  by Oxford Aberdeen and Glasgow  There is a fourth class but their number is so small that they would not deserve a distinction was it not necessary in a work of this nature to observe the greatest precision and nicety to avoid a confusion of character And these men I speak of are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers with a view of saving money for various reasons and upon various pretences but as they might also save themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at homeand as their reasons for travelling are the least complex of any other species of emigrants I shall distinguish  these gentlemen by the name of  Simple Travellers  Thus the whole circle of travellers may be reduced to the following  Heads  Idle Travellers  Inquisitive Travellers  Lying Travellers  Proud Travellers  Vain Travellers  Splenetic Travellers  Then follow the Travellers of Necessity  The delinquent and felonious Traveller  The unfortunate and innocent Traveller  The simple Traveller  And last of all if you please  The Sentimental Traveller  meaning thereby myself who have travell'd and of which I am now sitting down to give an accountas much out of  Necessity  and the  besoin de  Voyager as any one in the class  I am well aware at the same time as both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my forerunners that I might have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myselfbut I should break in upon the confines of the  Vain  Traveller in wishing to draw attention towards me till I have some better grounds for it than the mere  Novelty of my Vehicle  It is sufficient for my reader if he has been a traveller himself that with study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the catalogueit will be one step towards knowing himself as it is great odds but he retains some tincture and resemblance of what he imbibed or carried out to the present hour  The man who first transplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope observe he was a Dutch man never dreamt of drinking the same wine at the Cape that the same grape produced upon the French mountainshe was too phlegmatic for thatbut undoubtedly  he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor but whether good bad or indifferenthe knew enough of this world to know that it did not depend upon his choice but that what is generally called  chance  was to decide his success however he hoped for the best and in these hopes by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head and the depth of his discretion  Mynheer  might possibly overset both in his new vineyard and by discovering his nakedness become a laughingstock to his people  Even so it fares with the poor Traveller sailing and posting through the politer kingdoms of the globe  in pursuit of knowledge and improvements  Knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose but whether useful knowledge and real improvements is all a lotteryand even where the adventurer is successful the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety to turn to any profitbut as the chances run prodigiously the other way both as to the acquisition and application I am of opinion That a man would act as wisely if he could prevail upon himself to live contented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements especially  if he lives in a country that has no absolute want of eitherand indeed much grief of heart has it oft and many a time cost me when I have observed how many a foul step the inquisitive Traveller has measured to see sights and look into discoveries all which as Sancho Panca said to Don Quixote they might have seen dryshod at home It is an age so full of light that there is scarce a country or corner of Europe whose beams are not crossed and interchanged with othersKnowledge in most of its branches and in most affairs is like music in an Italian street whereof those may partake who pay nothingBut there is no nation under heaven  and God is my record before whose tribunal I must one day come and give an account of this workthat I do not speak it vauntinglyBut there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learningwhere the sciences may be more fitly woo'd or more surely won than herewhere art is encouraged and will so soon rise highwhere Nature take her all together has so little to answer forand to close all where there is more wit and variety of character to feed the mind withWhere then my dear countrymen are you going  We are only looking at this chaise said theyYour most obedient  servant said I skipping out of it and pulling off my hatWe were wondering said one of them who I found was an  inquisitive traveller  what could occasion its motion'Twas the agitation said I coolly of writing a prefaceI never heard said the other who was a  simple traveller  of a preface wrote in a  Desobligeant  It would have been better said I in a  Vis a Vis    As an English man does not travel to see English men  I retired to my room  CALAIS  I Perceived that something darken'd the passage more than myself as I stepp'd along it to my room it was effectually Mons Dessein the master of the hôtel who had just return'd from vespers and with his hat under his arm was most complaisantly following me to put me in mind of my wants I had wrote myself pretty well out of conceit with the  Desobligeant  and Mons Dessein speaking of it with a shrug as if it would no way suit me it immediately struck my fancy that it belong'd to some  innocent traveller  who on his  return home had left it to Mons Dessein's honour to make the most of Four months had elapsed since it had finish'd its career of Europe in the corner of Mons Dessein's coachyard and having sallied out from thence but a vamptup business at the first though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis it had not profited much by its adventuresbut by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of Mons Dessein's coachyard Much indeed was not to be said for itbut something mightand when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress I hate the man who can be a churl of them  Now was I the master of this hôtel said I laying the point of my forefinger on Mons Dessein's breast I would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate  Desobligeant  itstands swinging reproaches at you every time you pass by it  Mon Dieu  said Mons DesseinI have no interestExcept the interest said I which men of a certain turn of mind take Mons Dessein in their own sensationsI'm persuaded to a man who feels for others as well as for himself every rainy night disguise it as you will must cast a damp upon your spiritsYou suffer Mons Dessein as much as the machine  I have always observed when there is as much  sour  as  sweet  in a compliment that an Englishman is eternally at a loss within himself whether to take it or let it alone a Frenchman never is Mons Dessein made me a bow  C'est bien vrai  said heBut in this case I should only exchange one disquietude for another and with loss figure to yourself my dear Sir that in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to Parisfigure to yourself how much I should suffer in giving an ill impression of myself to a man of honour and lying at the mercy as I must do  d'un homme d'esprit  The dose was made up exactly after my own prescription so I could not help taking itand returning Mons Dessein his bow without more casuistry we walk'd together towards his Remise to take a view of his magazine of chaises  IN THE STREET  CALAIS  IT must needs be a hostile kind of a world when the buyer if it be but of a sorry postchaise cannot go forth with the seller thereof into the street to terminate the difference betwixt them but he instantly falls into the same frame of mind and views his conventionist with the same sort of eye as if he was going along with him to Hydepark corner to fight a duel For my own part being but a poor sword'sman and no way a match for Monsieur  Dessein  I felt the rotation of  all the movements within me to which the situation is incidentI looked at Monsieur  Dessein  through and throughey'd him as he walked along in profilethen  en face  thought he look'd like a Jewthen a Turkdisliked his wigcursed him by my godswished him at the devil  And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of three or four louisd'ors which is the most I can be overreach'd inBase passion said I turning myself about as a man naturally does upon a sudden reverse of sentimentbase ungentle passion thy hand is against every man and  every man's hand against theeheaven forbid said she raising her hand up to her forehead for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had seen in conference with the monkshe had followed us unperceivedHeaven forbid indeed said I offering her my ownshe had a black pair of silk gloves open only at the thumb and two forefingers so accepted it without reserveand I led her up to the door of the Remise  Monsieur  Dessein  had  diabled  the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand we were as impatient as himself to have it open'd and so  attentive to the obstacle that I continued holding her hand almost without knowing it so that Monsieur  Dessein  left us together with her hand in mine and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remise and said he would be back in five minutes  Now a colloquy of five minutes in such a situation is worth one of as many ages with your faces turned towards the street in the latter case 'tis drawn from the objects and occurrences withoutwhen your eyes are fixed upon a dead blankyou draw purely from yourselves A silence of a single moment upon Monsieur  Dessein  's  leaving us had been fatal to the situationshe had infallibly turned aboutso I begun the conversation instantly  But what were the temptations as I write not to apologize for the weaknesses of my heart in this tourbut to give an account of themshall be described with the same simplicity with which I felt them  THE REMISE DOOR  CALAIS  WHEN I told the reader that I did not care to get out of the  Desobligeant  because I saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the innI told him the truth but I did not tell him the whole truth for I was full as much restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to Suspicion crossed my brain and said he was telling her what had passed something jarred upon it within meI wished him at his convent  When the heart flies out before the understanding it saves the judgment a world of painsI was certain she was of a better order of beingshowever I thought no more of her but went on and wrote my preface  The impression returned upon my encounter with her in the street a guarded frankness with which she gave me her hand shewed I thought her good education and her good sense and as I led her on I felt a pleasurable ductility about her which spread a calmness over all my spirits  Good God how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world with him  I had not yet seen her face'twas not material for the drawing was instantly set about and long before we had got to the door of the Remise  Fancy  had finished the whole head and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess as if she had dived into the TIBER for itbut thou art a seduced and a seducing slut and albeit thou cheatest us seven times a day with thy pictures and images yet with so many charms dost thou do it and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes of so many angels of light 'tis a shame to break with thee  When we had got to the door of the Remise she withdrew her hand from across her forehead and let me see the originalit was a face of about six and twentyof a clear transparent brown simply set off without rouge or powderit was not critically handsome but there was that in it which in the frame of mind I was in which attached me much more to itit was interesting I fancied it wore the characters of a widow'd look and in that state of its declension which had passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its lossbut a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines I wish'd to know  what they had beenand was ready to enquire had the same  bon ton  of conversation permitted as in the days of Esdras  "  What aileth thee and why art thou disquieted and why is thy understanding troubled  "  In a word I felt benevolence for her and resolved some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesyif not of service  Such were my temptationsand in this disposition to give way to them was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine and with our faces both turned closer to the door of the Remise than what was absolutely necessary  THE REMISE DOOR  CALAIS  THIS certainly fair lady said I raising her hand up a little lightly as I began must be one of Fortune's whimsical doings to take two utter strangers by their handsof different sexes and perhaps from different corners of the globe and in one moment place them together in such a cordial situation as Friendship herself could scarce have atchieved for them had she projected it for a month  And your reflection upon it shews how much Monsieur she has embarassed you by the adventure  When the situation is what we would wish nothing is so illtimed as to hint at the circumstances which make it so you thank Fortune continued sheyou had reasonthe heart knew it and was satisfied and who but an English philosopher would have sent notices of it to the brain to reverse the judgment  In saying this she disengaged her hand with a look which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text  It is a miserable picture which I am going to give of the weakness of my heart by owning that it suffered a pain which worthier occasions could not have inflictedI was mortified with the loss of her hand and the manner in which I had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound I never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life  The triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat in order to finish her reply so some way or other God knows how I regained my situation  She had nothing to add  I forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this that I had been mistaken in her character but upon turning her face towards me the spirit which had animated the reply was fledthe muscles relaxed and I beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interestmelancholy to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrowI pitied her from my soul and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heartI could have taken her into my arms and cherished her  though it was in the open street without blushing  The pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers told her what was passing within me she looked downa silence of some moments followed  I fear in this interval I must have made some slight efforts towards a closer compression of her hand from a subtle sensation I felt in the palm of my ownnot as if she was going to withdraw hersbut as if she thought about itand I had infallibly lost it a second time had not instinct more than reason directed me to the last resource  in these dangersto hold it loosely and in a manner as if I was every moment going to release it of myself so she let it continue till Monsieur  Dessein  returned with the key and in the mean time I set myself to consider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk's story in case he had told it her must have planted in her breast against me  THE SNUFFBOX  CALAIS  THE good old monk was within six paces of us as the idea of him cross'd my mind and was advancing towards us a little out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or noHe stopp'd however as soon as he came up to us with a world of frankness and having a horn snuffbox in his hand he presented it open to meYou shall taste minesaid I pulling out my box which was a small tortoise one and putting it into his hand  'Tis most excellent said the monk Then do me the favour I replied to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometimes recollect it was the peaceoffering of a man who once used you unkindly but not from his heart  The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet  Mon Dieu  said he pressing his hands togetheryou never used me unkindlyI should think said the lady he is not likely I blush'd in my turn but from what movements I leave to the few who feel to analyseExcuse me Madame replied II treated him most unkindly and from no provocations'Tis impossible said the ladyMy  God cried the monk with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to himthe fault was in me and in the indiscretion of my zealthe lady opposed it and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his could give offence to any  I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt itWe remained silent without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word Whilst this lasted the monk rubb'd his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunick  and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the frictionhe made a low bow and said 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contestbut be it as it wouldhe begg'd we might exchange boxesIn saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and having kiss'd itwith a stream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his bosomand took his leave  I guard this box as I would the instrumental parts of my religion to help my mind on to something better in truth I seldom go abroad  without it and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world they had found full employment for his as I learnt from his story till about the fortyfifth year of his age when upon some military services ill requited and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions he abandon'd the sword and the sex together and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself  I feel a damp upon my spirits as I am going to add that in my last return through Calais upon inquiring after Father Lorenzo I heard  he had been dead near three months and was buried not in his convent but according to his desire in a little cimetiery belonging to it about two leagues off I had a strong desire to see where they had laid himwhen upon pulling out his little horn box as I sat by his grave and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it which had no business to grow there they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections that I burst into a flood of tearsbut I am as weak as a woman and I beg the world not to smile but pity me  THE REMISE DOOR  CALAIS  I HAD never quitted the lady's hand all this time and had held it so long that it would have been indecent to have let it go without first pressing it to my lips the blood and spirits which had suffer'd a revulsion from her crouded back to her as I did it  Now the two travellers who had spoke to me in the coachyard happening at that crisis to be passing by and observing our communications naturally took it into their heads that  we must be  man and wife  at least so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the Remise the one of them who was the inquisitive traveller ask'd us if we set out for Paris the next morningI could only answer for myself I said and the lady added she was for AmiensWe dined there yesterday said the simple travellerYou go directly through the town added the other in your road to Paris I was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence  that Amiens was in the road to Paris  but upon pulling out my poor monk's little horn box to take a pinch of snuffI made them a quiet bow and wishing them a  good passage to Doverthey left us alone  Now where would be the harm said I to myself if I was to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaiseand what mighty mischief could ensue  Every dirty passion and bad propensity in my nature took the alarm as I stated the propositionIt will oblige you to have a third horse said AVARICE which will put twenty livres out of your pocketYou know not who she is said CAUTIONor what scrapes the affair may draw you into whisper'd COWARDICE  Depend upon it Yorick said DISCRETION 'twill be said you went off with a mistress and came by assignation to Calais for that purpose  You can never after cried HYPOCRISY aloud shew your face in the worldor rise quoth MEANNESS in the churchor be any thing in it said PRIDE but a lousy prebendary  But 'tis a civil thing said Iand as I generally act from the first impulse and therefore seldom listen to these cabals which serve no purpose that I know of but to encompass the heart with adamantI turn'd instantly about to the lady  But she had glided off unperceived as the cause was pleading and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street by the time I had made the determination so I set off after her with a long stride to make her the proposal with the best address I was master of but observing she walk'd with her cheek half resting upon the palm of her handwith the slow shortmeasur'd step of thoughtfulness and with her eyes as she went step by step fix'd upon the ground it struck me she was trying the same cause herselfGod help her said I she has some motherinlaw or tartufish aunt or nonsensical old woman to consult upon the occasion as well as myself so not caring  to interrupt the processe and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by surprize I faced about and took a short turn or two before the door of the Remise whilst she walk'd musing on one side  IN THE STREET  CALAIS  HAVING on first sight of the lady settled the affair in my fancy  "that she was of the better order of beings"  and then laid it down as a second axiom as indisputable as the first That she was a widow and wore a character of distressI went no further I got ground enough for the situation which pleased meand had she remained close beside my elbow till midnight I should have held true to my system and considered her only under that general idea  She had scarce got twenty paces distant from me ere something within me called out for a more particular inquiryit brought on the idea of a further separationI might possibly never see her morethe heart is for saving what it can and I wanted the traces thro' which my wishes might find their way to her in case I should never rejoin her myself in a word I wish'd to know her nameher family'sher condition and as I knew the place to which she was going I wanted to know from whence she came but there was no coming at all this intelligence a hundred little delicacies stood in the way I form'd a score different plansThere was  no such thing as a man's asking her directlythe thing was impossible  A little French  debonaire  captain who came dancing down the street shewed me it was the easiest thing in the world for popping in betwixt us just as the lady was returning back to the door of the Remise he introduced himself to my acquaintance and before he had well got announced begg'd I would do him the honour to present him to the ladyI had not been presented myselfso turning about to her he did it just as well by asking her if she had come from ParisNo she was going that rout she said  Vous n'etez pas de Londre  She was not she replied  Then Madame must have come thro' Flanders  Apparamment vous etez Flammande  said the French captainThe lady answered she was  Peutetre de Lisle  added heShe said she was not of LisleNor Arrasnor Cambraynor Ghentnor Brussels She answered she was of Brussels  He had had the honour he said to be at the bombardment of it last warthat it was finely situated  pour cela  and full of noblesse when the Imperialists were driven out by the French the lady made a slight curtsyso giving her an account of the affair and of the share he had had in  ithe begg'd the honour to know her nameso made his bow    Et Madame a son Mari  said he looking back when he had made two stepsand without staying for an answerdanced down the street  Had I served seven years apprenticeship to good breeding I could not have done as much  THE REMISE  CALAIS  AS the little French captain left us Mons Dessein came up with the key of the Remise in his hand and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises  The first object which caught my eye as Mons Dessein open'd the door of the Remise was another old tatter'd  Desobligeant  and notwithstanding it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coachyard but an hour beforethe very sight of it stirr'd up a  disagreeable sensation within me now and I thought 'twas a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter to construct such a machine nor had I much more charity for the man who could think of using it  I observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself so Mons Dessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast telling us as he recommended them that they had been purchased by my Lord A and B to go the  grand tour  but had gone no further than Paris so were in all respects as good as newThey were too goodso I pass'd on to a third which stood behind and forthwith began to chaffer for the  priceBut 'twill scarce hold two said I opening the door and getting inHave the goodness Madam said Mons Dessein offering his arm to step inThe lady hesitated half a second and stepp'd in and the waiter that moment beckoning to speak to Mons Dessein he shut the door of the chaise upon us and left us  THE REMISE  CALAIS  C'EST bien comique  'tis very droll said the lady smiling from the reflection that this was the second time we had been left together by a parcel of nonsensical contingencies  c'est bien comique  said she  There wants nothing said I to make it so but the comick use which the gallantry of a Frenchman would put it toto make love the first moment and an offer of his person the second  'Tis their  fort  replied the lady  It is supposed so at leastand how it has come to pass continued I I know not but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love and making it better than any other nation upon earth but for my own part I think them errant bunglers and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried Cupid's patience  To think of making love by  sentiments  I should as soon think of making a genteel suit of cloaths out of remnantsand to do itpopat first sight by declarationis submitting  the offer and themselves with it to be sifted with all their  pours  and  contres  by an unheated mind  The lady attended as if she expected I should go on  Consider then madam continued I laying my hand upon hers  That grave people hate Love for the name's sake  That selfish people hate it for their own  Hypocrites for heaven's  And that all of us both old and young being ten times worse  frighten'd than hurt by the very  report  What a want of knowledge in this branch of commerce a man betrays whoever lets the word come out of his lips till an hour or two at least after the time that his silence upon it becomes tormenting A course of small quiet attentions not so pointed as to alarmnor so vague as to be misunderstoodwith now and then a look of kindness and little or nothing said upon itleaves Nature for your mistress and she fashions it to her mind  Then I solemnly declare said the lady blushingyou have been making love to me all this while  THE REMISE  CALAIS  MONSIEUR  Dessein  came back to let us out of the chaise and acquaint the lady the Count de L  her brother was just arrived at the hotel Though I had infinite good will for the lady I cannot say that I rejoiced in my heart at the eventand could not help telling her sofor it is fatal to a proposal Madam said I that I was going to make you  You need not tell me what the proposal was said she laying her  hand upon both mine as she interrupted meA man my good Sir has seldom an offer of kindness to maketo a woman but she has a presentiment of it some moments before  Nature arms her with it said I for immediate preservationBut I think said she looking in my face I had no evil to apprehendand to deal frankly with you had determined to accept itIf I hadshe stopped a momentI believe your good will would have drawn a story from me which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey  In saying this she suffered me to kiss her hand twice and with a look of sensibility mixed with a concern she got out of the chaiseand bid adieu  IN THE STREET  CALAIS  I NEVER finished a twelveguinea bargain so expeditiously in my life my time seemed heavy upon the loss of the lady and knowing every moment of it would be as two till I put myself into motionI ordered post horses directly and walked towards the hotel  Lord said I hearing the town clock strike four and recollecting that I had been little more than a single hour in Calais  What a large volume of adventures may be grasped within this little span of life by him who interests his heart in every thing and who having eyes to see what time and chance are perpetually holding out to him as he journeyeth on his way misses nothing he can  fairly  lay his hands on  If this won't turn out somethinganother willno matter'tis an assay upon human natureI get my labour for my pains'tis enoughthe pleasure of the experiment has kept my senses and the best part of my blood awake and laid the gross to sleep  I pity the man who can travel from  Dan  to  Beersheba  and cry 'Tis all barrenand so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers I declare said I clapping my hands chearily together that was I in a desart I would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affectionsIf I could not do better I would fasten them upon some sweet myrtle or seek some melancholy cypress to connect myself toI would court their shade and greet them kindly for their protectionI would cut my name upon them and swear they were the loveliest trees throughout the desert if their leaves wither'd I would teach  myself to mourn and when they rejoiced I would rejoice along with them  The learned SMELFUNGUS travelled from Boulogne to Parisfrom Paris to Romeand so onbut he set out with the spleen and jaundice and every object he pafs'd by was discoloured or distortedHe wrote an account of them but'twas nothing but the account of his miserable feelings  I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheonhe was just coming out of it  'Tis nothing but a huge cockpit  Vide S  's Travels  said heI wish you had said nothing worse of the Venus  of Medicis replied Ifor in passing through Florence I had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess and used her worse than a common strumpet without the least provocation in nature  I popp'd upon Smelfungus again at Turin in his return home and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell  "wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field and of the cannibals which each other eat the Anthropophagi"  he had been flea'd alive and bedevil'd and used worse than St Bartholomew at every stage he had come at  I'll tell it cried Smelfungus to the world You had better tell it said I to your physician  Mundungus with an immense fortune made the whole tour going on from Rome to Naplesfrom Naples to Venicefrom Venice to Viennato Dresden to Berlin without one generous connection or pleasurable anecdote to tell of but he had travell'd straight on looking neither to his right hand or his left lest Love or Pity should seduce him out of his road  Peace be to them if it is to be found but heaven itself was it possible to get there with such tempers  would want objects to give itevery gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of Love to hail their arrivalNothing would the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus hear of but fresh anthems of joy fresh raptures of love and fresh congratulations of their common felicityI heartily pity them they have brought up no faculties for this work and was the happiest mansion in heaven to be allotted to Smelfungus and Mundungus they would be so far from being happy that the souls of Smelfungus and Mundungus would do penance there to all eternity  MONTRIUL  I HAD once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise and twice got out in the rain and one of the times up to the knees in dirt to help the postilion to tie it on without being able to find out what was wantingNor was it till I got to Montriul upon the landlord's asking me if I wanted not a servant that it occurred to me that that was the very thing  A servant That I do most sadly quoth IBecause Monsieur said the landlord there is a clever young fellow  who would be very proud of the honour to serve an EnglishmanBut why an English one more than any otherThey are so generous said the landlordI'll be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket quoth I to myself this very nightBut they have wherewithal to be so Monsieur added heSet down one livre more for that quoth IIt was but last night said the landlord  qu'un my Lord Anglois presentoit un ecu a la fille de chambre    Tant pis pour Madlle Janatone  said I  Now Janatone being the landlord's daughter and the landlord supposing I was young in French took the liberty to inform me I should  not have said  tant pis  but  tant mieux Tant mieux toujours Monsieur  said he when there is any thing to be got  tant pis  when there is nothing It comes to the same thing said I  Pardonnez moi  said the landlord  I cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all that  tant pis  and  tant mieux  being two of the great hinges in French conversation a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of them before he gets to Paris  A prompt French Marquis at our ambassador's table demanded of Mr H  if he was H  the poet  No said H  mildly  Tant pis  replied the Marquis  It is H  the historian said another  Tant mieux  said the Marquis And Mr H  who is a man of an excellent heart return'd thanks for both  When the landlord had set me right in this matter he called in La Fleur which was the name of the young man he had spoke ofsaying only first That as for his talents he would presume to say nothingMonsieur was the best judge what would suit him but for the fidelity of La Fleur he would stand responsible in all he was worth  The landlord deliver'd this in a manner which instantly set my mind to the business I was uponand La Fleur who stood waiting without in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our turns came in  MONTRIUL  I AM apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight but never more so than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a devil as myself and as I know this weakness I always suffer my judgment to draw back something on that very accountand this more or less according to the mood I am in and the caseand I may add the gender too of the person I am to govern  When La Fleur enter'd the room after every discount I could make for my soul the genuine look and air of  the fellow determined the matter at once in his favour so I hired him firstand then began to inquire what he could do But I shall find out his talents quoth I as I want thembesides a Frenchman can do every thing  Now poor La Fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum and play a march or two upon the fife I was determined to make his talents do and can't say my weakness was ever so insulted by my wisdom as in the attempt  La Fleur had set out early in life as gallantly as most Frenchmen do with  serving  for a few years at the end  of which having satisfied the sentiment and found moreover That the honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward as it open'd no further track of glory to himhe retired  a ses terres  and lived  comme il plaisoit a Dieu  that is to say upon nothing  And so quoth  Wisdome  you have hired a drummer to attend you in this tour of your's thro' France and Italy Psha said I and do not one half of our gentry go with a humdrum  compagnon du voiage  the same round and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besides When man can extricate himself with  an  equivoque  in such an unequal matchhe is not ill ofBut you can do something else La Fleur said I  O qu'oui  he could make spatterdashes and play a little upon the fiddleBravo said WisdomeWhy I play a bass myself said Iwe shall do very wellYou can shave and dress a wig a little La FleurHe had all the dispositions in the worldIt is enough for heaven said I interrupting himand ought to be enough for meSo supper coming in and having a frisky English spaniel on one side of my chair and a French valet with as much hilarity in his countenance as ever nature painted in one on the otherI was  satisfied to my heart's content with my empire and if monarchs knew what they would be at they might be as satisfied as I was  MONTRIUL  AS La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me and will be often upon the stage I must interest the reader a little further in his behalf by saying that I had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine me than in regard to this fellowhe was a faithful affectionate simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher and notwithstanding his talents of drumbeating and spatterdashmaking which tho' very good in themselves happen'd to be of no great service to me yet  was I hourly recompenced by the festivity of his temperit supplied all defectsI had a constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and distresses of my ownI was going to have added of his too but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing for whether 'twas hunger or thirst or cold or nakedness or watchings or whatever stripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings there was no index in his physiognomy to point them out byhe was eternally the same so that if I am a piece of a philosopher which Satan now and then puts it into my head I amit always mortifies the pride of the conceit by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional philosophy  of this poor fellow for shaming me into one of a better kind With all this La Fleur had a small cast of the coxcombbut he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art and before I had been three days in Paris with himhe seemed to be no coxcomb at all  MONTRIUL  THE next morning La Fleur entering upon his employment I delivered to him the key of my portmanteau with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches and bid him fasten all upon the chaiseget the horses put toand desire the landlord to come in with his bill  C'est un garçon de bonne fortune  said the landlord pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about La Fleur and were most kindly taking their leave of him as the postilion was leading out the horses La Fleur kissed all their hands round and  round again and thrice he wiped his eyes and thrice he promised he would bring them all pardons from Rome  The young fellow said the landlord is beloved by all the town and there is scarce a corner in Montriul where the want of him will not be felt he has but one misfortune in the world continued he  "He is always in love"  I am heartily glad of it said I'twill save me the trouble every night of putting my breeches under my head In saying this I was making not so much La Fleur's eloge as my own having been in love with one princess or another almost all my life and I  hope I shall go on so till I die being firmly persuaded that if ever I do a mean action it must be in some interval betwixt one passion and another whilst this interregnum lasts I always perceive my heart locked upI can scarce find in it to give Misery a sixpence and therefore I always get out of it as fast as I can and the moment I am rekindled I am all generosity and good will again and would do any thing in the world either for or with any one if they will but satisfy me there is no sin in it  But in saying thissurely I am commending the passionnot myself  A FRAGMENT  THE town of Abdera notwithstanding Democritus lived there trying all the powers of irony and laughter to reclaim it was the vilest and most profligate town in all Thrace What for poisons conspiracies and assassinationslibels pasquinades and tumults there was no going there by day'twas worse by night  Now when things were at the worst it came to pass that the Andromeda of Euripides being represented at Abdera the whole orchestra was delighted with it but of all the  passages which delighted them nothing operated more upon their imaginations than the tender strokes of nature which the poet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of Perseus  O Cupid prince of God and men  c  Every man almost spoke pure iambics the next day and talk'd of nothing but Perseus his pathetic address  "O Cupid prince of God and men"  in every street of Abdera in every house  "O Cupid Cupid"  in every mouth like the natural notes of some sweet melody which drops from it whether it will or nonothing but  "Cupid Cupid prince of God and men"  The fire caughtand the whole city like  the heart of one man open'd itself to Love  No pharmacopolist could sell one grain of heleborenot a single armourer had a heart to forge one instrument of deathFriendship and Virtue met together and kiss'd each other in the streetthe golden age return'd and hung o'er the town of Abderaevery Abderite took his oaten pipe and every Abderitish woman left her purple web and chastly sat her down and listen'd to the song  'Twas only in the power says the Fragment of the God whose empire  extendeth from heaven to earth and even to the depths of the sea to have done this  MONTRIUL  WHEN all is ready and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn unless you are a little sour'd by the adventure there is always a matter to compound at the door before you can get into your chaise and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty who surround you Let no man say  "let them go to the devil"  'tis a cruel journey to send a few miserables and they have had sufferings enow without it I always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand and I would counsel every gentle traveller  to do so likewise he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving themthey will be register'd elsewhere  For my own part there is no man gives so little as I do for few that I know have so little to give but as this was the first publick act of my charity in France I took the more notice of it  A wellaway said I I have but eight sous in the world shewing them in my hand and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em  A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim by  retiring two steps out of the circle and making a disqualifying bow on his part Had the whole parterre cried out  Place aux dames  with one voice it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect  Just heaven for what wise reasons hast thou order'd it that beggary and urbanity which are at such variance in other countries should find a way to be at unity in this  I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous merely for his  politesse  A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow who stood overagainst me in the circle putting something first under his arm which had once been a hat took his snuffbox out of his pocket and generously offer'd a pinch on both sides of him it was a gift of consequence and modestly declinedThe poor little fellow press'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeness  Prenez en    prenez  said he looking another way so they each took a pinchPity thy box should ever want one said I to myself so I put a couple of sous into ittaking a small pinch out of his box to enhance their value as I did itHe felt the weight of the second obligation more than that of the first'twas  doing him an honourthe other was only doing him a charityand he made me a bow down to the ground for it  Here said I to an old soldier with one hand who had been campaign'd and worn out to death in the servicehere's a couple of sous for thee  Vive le Roi  said the old soldier  I had then but three sous left so I gave one simply  pour l'amour de Dieu  which was the footing on which it was begg'dThe poor woman had a dislocated hip so it could not be well upon any other motive  Mon cher et tres charitable Monsieur  There's no opposing this said I  My Lord Anglois  the very sound was worth the moneyso I gave  my last sous for it  But in the eagerness of giving I had overlook'd a  pauvre honteux  who had no one to ask a sous for him and who I believed would have perish'd ere he could have ask'd one for himself he stood by the chaise a little without the circle and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen better daysGood God said Iand I have not one single sous left to give himBut you have a thousand cried all the powers of nature stirring within meso I gave himno matter whatI am  ashamed to say  how much  nowand was ashamed to think how little then so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition as these two fixed points are given him he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum  I could afford nothing for the rest but  Dieu vous benisse    Et le bon Dieu vous benisse encore  said the old soldier the dwarf c The  pauvre honteux  could say nothinghe pull'd out a little handkerchief and wiped his face as he turned awayand I thought he thank'd me more than them all  THE BIDET  HAVING settled all these little matters I got into my postchaise with more ease than ever I got into a postchaise in my life and La Fleur having got one large jackboot on the far side of a little  bidet  Post horse  and another on this for I count nothing of his legshe canter'd away before me as happy and as perpendicular as a prince  But what is happiness what is grandeur in this painted scene of life A dead ass before we had got a league put a sudden stop to La Fleur's careerhis bidet would not  pass by ita contention arose betwixt them and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jackboots the very first kick  La Fleur bore his fall like a French christian saying neither more or less upon it than Diable so presently got up and came to the charge again astride his bidet beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum  The bidet flew from one side of the road to the other then back againthen this waythen that way and in short every way but by the dead assLa Fleur insisted upon the thingand the bidet threw him  What's the matter La Fleur said I with this bidet of thine  Monsieur  said he  c'est un cheval le plus opiniatré du monde  Nay if he is a conceited beast he must go his own way replied Iso La Fleur got off him and giving him a good sound lash the bidet took me at my word and away he scamper'd back to Montriul  Peste  said La Fleur  It is not  mal a propos  to take notice here that tho' La Fleur availed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounternamely  Diable  and  Peste  that there are nevertheless three in the French language like the positive comparative and superlative one or  the other of which serve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life  Le Diable  which is the first and positive degree is generally used upon ordinary emotions of the mind where small things only fall out contrary to your expectationssuch asthe throwing once doubletsLa Fleur's being kick'd off his horse and so forthcuckoldom for the same reason is always  Le Diable  But in cases where the cast has something provoking in it as in that of the bidet's running away after and leaving La Fleur aground in jackboots'tis the second degree  'Tis then  Peste  And for the third  But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellowfeeling when I reflect what miseries must have been their lot and how bitterly so refined a people must have smarted to have forced them upon the use of it  Grant me O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distresswhatever is my  cast  Grant me but decent words to exclaim in and I will give my nature way  But as these were not to be had in France I resolved to take every  evil just as it befell me without any exclamation at all  La Fleur who had made no such covenant with himself followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of sightand then you may imagine if you please with what word he closed the whole affair  As there was no hunting down a frighten'd horse in jackboots there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise or into it  I preferred the latter and in half an hour we got to the posthouse at Nampont  NAMPONT  THE DEAD ASS  AND this said he putting the remains of a crust into his walletand this should have been thy portion said he hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me I thought by the accent it had been an apostrophe to his child but 'twas to his ass and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road which had occasioned La Fleur's misadventure The man seemed to lament it much and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho's lamentation  for his but he did it with more true touches of nature  The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side which he took up from time to timethen laid them downlook'd at them and shook his head He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again as if to eat it held it some time in his handthen laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridlelooked wistfully at the little arrangement he had madeand then gave a sigh  The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him and La Fleur  amongst the rest whilst the horses were getting ready as I continued sitting in the postchaise I could see and hear over their heads  He said he had come last from Spain where he had been from the furthest borders of Franconia and had got so far on his return home when his ass died Every one seem'd desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home  It had pleased heaven he said to bless him with three sons the finest lads in all Germany but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the smallpox and the  youngest falling ill of the same distemper he was afraid of being bereft of them all and made a vow if Heaven would not take him from him also he would go in gratitude to St Iago in Spain  When the mourner got thus far on his story he stopp'd to pay nature her tributeand wept bitterly  He said Heaven had accepted the conditions and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature who had been a patient partner of his journeythat it had eat the same bread with him all the way and was unto him as a friend  Every body who stood about heard the poor fellow with concernLa Fleur offered him moneyThe mourner said he did not want itit was not the value of the assbut the loss of himThe ass he said he was assured loved himand upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met  Thou hast one comfort friend said I at least in the loss of thy poor beast I'm sure thou hast been a merciful  master to himAlas said the mourner I thought so when he was alivebut now that he is dead I think otherwiseI fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for himthey have shortened the poor creature's days and I fear I have them to answer forShame on the world said I to myselfDid we love each other as this poor soul but loved his ass'twould be something  NAMPONT  THE POSTILLION  THE concern which the poor fellow's story threw me into required some attention the postillion paid not the least to it but set off upon the  pavè  in a full gallop  The thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of Arabia could not have wished more for a cup of cold water than mine did for grave and quiet movements and I should have had an high opinion of the postillion had he but stolen off with me in something like a pensive paceOn the  contrary as the mourner finished his lamentation the fellow gave an unfeeling lash to each of his beasts and set off clattering like a thousand devils  I called to him as loud as I could for heaven's sake to go slowerand the louder I called the more unmercifully he gallopedThe deuce take him and his galloping toosaid Ihe'll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a foolish passion and then he'll go slow that I may enjoy the sweets of it  The postillion managed the point to a miracle by the time he had got  to the foot of a steep hill about half a league from Namponthe had put me out of temper with himand then with myself for being so  My case then required a different treatment and a good rattling gallop would have been of real service to me  Then prithee get onget on my good lad said I  The postillion pointed to the hillI then tried to return back to the story of the poor German and his assbut I had broke the clueand could no more get into it again than the postillion could into a trot  The deuce go said I with it all Here am I sitting as candidly disposed to make the best of the worst as ever wight was and all runs counter  There is one sweet lenitive at least for evils which nature holds out to us so I took it kindly at her hands and fell asleep and the first word which roused me was  Amiens  Bless me said I rubbing my eyesthis is the very town where my poor lady is to come  AMIENS  THE words were scarce out of my mouth when the Count de L***'s postchaise with his sister in it drove hastily by she had just time to make me a bow of recognitionand of that particular kind of it which told me she had not yet done with me She was as good as her look for before I had quite finished my supper her brother's servant came into the room with a billet in which she said she had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter which I was to present myself to Madame R*** the first  morning I had nothing to do at Paris There was only added she was sorry but from what  penchant  she had not considered that she had been prevented telling me her storythat she still owed it me and if my rout should ever lay through Brussels and I had not by then forgot the name of Madame de L***that Madame de L*** would be glad to discharge her obligation  Then I will meet thee said I fair spirit at Brussels'tis only returning from Italy through Germany to Holland by the rout of Flanders home'twill scarce be ten posts out of my way but were it ten thousand with what a moral delight will  it crown my journey in sharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer to see her weep and though I cannot dry up the fountain of her tears what an exquisite sensation is there still left in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women as I'm sitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night besides her  There was nothing wrong in the sentiment and yet I instantly reproached my heart with it in the bitterest and most reprobate of expressions  It had ever as I told the reader been one of the singular blessings of my life to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the sudden turn of a corner I had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of Eliza but about three months beforeswearing as I did it that it should last me through the whole journeyWhy should I dissemble the matter I had sworn to her eternal fidelityshe had a right to my whole heartto divide my affections was to lessen themto expose them was to risk them where there is risk there may be lossand what wilt  thou have Yorick to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidenceso good so gentle and unreproaching  I will not go to Brussels replied I interrupting myselfbut my imagination went onI recall'd her looks at that crisis of our separation when neither of us had power to say Adieu I look'd at the picture she had tied in a black ribband about my neckand blush'd as I look'd at itI would have given the world to have kiss'd itbut was ashamedAnd shall this tender flower said I pressing it between my handsshall it be smitten to its very rootand smitten Yorick  by thee who hast promised to shelter it in thy breast  Eternal fountain of happiness said I kneeling down upon the groundbe thou my witnessand every pure spirit which tastes it be my witness also That I would not travel to Brussels unless Eliza went along with me did the road lead me towards heaven  In transports of this kind the heart in spite of the understanding will always say too much  THE LETTER  AMIENS  FORTUNE had not smiled upon La Fleur for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of chivalryand not one thing had offer'd to signalize his zeal for my service from the time he had enter'd into it which was almost four and twenty hours The poor soul burn'd with impatience and the Count de L***'s servant's coming with the letter being the first practicable occasion which offered La Fleur had laid hold of it and in order to do honour to his  master had taken him into a back parlour in the Auberge and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in Picardy and the Count de L***'s servant in return and not to be behind hand in politeness with La Fleur had taken him back with him to the Count's hôtel La Fleur's  prevenancy  for there was a passport in his very looks soon set every servant in the kitchen at ease with him and as a Frenchman whatever be his talents has no sort of prudery in shewing them La Fleur in less than five minutes had pull'd out his fife and leading off the dance himself with the first note set the  fille de chambre  the  maitre d'hotel  the cook  the scullion and all the houshold dogs and cats besides an old monkey a dancing I suppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood  Madame de L*** in passing from her brother's apartments to her own hearing so much jollity below stairs rung up her  fille de chambre  to ask about it and hearing it was the English gentleman's servant who had set the whole house merry with his pipe she order'd him up  As the poor fellow could not present himself empty he had loaden'd himself in going up stairs with a thousand compliments to Madame de L*** on the part of his master  added a long apocrypha of inquiries after Madame de L***'s healthtold her that Monsieur his master was  au desespoire  for her reestablishment from the fatigues of her journeyand to close all that Monsieur had received the letter which Madame had done him the honourAnd he has done me the honour said Madame de L*** interrupting La Fleur to send a billet in return  Madame de L*** had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact that La Fleur had not power to disappoint her expectationshe trembled for my honourand possibly might not altogether be unconcerned  for his own as a man capable of being attach'd to a master who could be a wanting  en egards vis a vis d'une femme  so that when Madame de L*** asked La Fleur if he had brought a letter  O qu'oui  said La Fleur so laying down his hat upon the ground and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his left hand he began to search for the letter with his rightthen contrarywise  Diable  then sought every pocketpocket by pocket round not forgetting his fob  Peste  then La Fleur emptied them upon the floorpulled out a dirty cravata handkerchiefa comba whip lasha nightcapthen gave a peep  into his hat  Quelle etourderie  He had left the letter upon the table in the Aubergehe would run for it and be back with it in three minutes  I had just finished my supper when La Fleur came in to give me an account of his adventure he told the whole story simply as it was and only added that if Monsieur had forgot  par hazard  to answer Madame's letter the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the  faux pas  and if not that things were only as they were  Now I was not altogether sure of my  etiquette  whether I ought to have wrote or no but if I hada devil  himself could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a wellmeaning creature for my honour and however he might have mistook the roador embarrassed me in so doinghis heart was in no faultI was under no necessity to writeand what weighed more than allhe did not look as if he had done amiss  'Tis all very well La Fleur said I'Twas sufficient La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening and return'd with pen ink and paper in his hand and coming up to the table laid them close before me with such a delight in his countenance that I could not help taking up the pen  I begun and begun again and though I had nothing to say and that nothing might have been express'd in half a dozen lines I made half a dozen different beginnings and could no way please myself  In short I was in no mood to write  La Fleur stepp'd out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my inkthen fetch'd sand and sealwaxIt was all one I wrote and blotted and tore off and burnt and wrote again  Le Diable l'emporte  said I half to myselfI cannot write this selfsame letter throwing the pen down despairingly as I said it  As soon as I had cast down the pen La Fleur advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table and making a thousand apologies for the liberty he was going to take told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife which he durst say would suit the occasion  I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humourThen prithee said I let me see it  La Fleur instantly pull'd out a little dirty pocketbook cramm'd full of small letters and billetdoux in a sad condition and laying it upon the table and then untying the string  which held them all together run them over one by one till he came to the letter in question  La voila  said he clapping his hands so unfolding it first he laid it before me and retired three steps from the table whilst I read it  THE LETTER  MADAME  JE suis penetré de la douleur la plus vive et reduit en même temps an desespoir par ce retour imprevû du Corporal qui rend notre entrevue de ce soir la chose du monde la plus impossible  Mais vive la joie et toute la mienne sera de penser a vous  L'amour n'est  rien  sans sentiment  Et le sentiment est encore  moins  sans amour  On dit qu'on ne doit jamais se desesperer  On dit aussi que Monsieur le Corporal monte la garde Mecredi alors ce sera mon tour  Chacun a son tour  En attendantVive l'amour et vive la bagatelle  Je suis MADAME  Avec toutes les sentiments les plus respecteux et les plus tendres tout a vous  JAQUES ROQUE  It was but changing the Corporal into the Countand saying nothing about mounting guard on Wednesdayand the letter was neither right or wrongso to gratify the poor fellow who stood trembling for my honour his own and the honour of his letterI took the cream gently off it and whipping it up in my own wayI seal'd it up and sent him with it to Madame de L***and the next morning we pursued our journey to Paris  PARIS  WHEN a man can contest the point by dint of equipage and carry all on floundering before him with half a dozen lackies and a couple of cooks'tis very well in such a place as Parishe may drive in at which end of a street he will  A poor prince who is weak in cavalry and whose whole infantry does not exceed a single man had best quit the field and signalize himself in the cabinet if he can get up into itI say  up into it  for there is no descending perpendicular amongst 'em with a  "  Me voici  mes enfans  "  here I amwhatever many may think  I own my first sensations as soon as I was left solitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel were far from being so flattering as I had prefigured them I walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black coat and looking through the glass saw all the world in yellow blue and green running at the ring of pleasureThe old with broken lances and in helmets which had lost their vizardsthe young in armour bright which shone like gold beplumed with each gay feather of the eastallall tilting at it like  fascinated knights in tournaments of yore for fame and love  Alas poor Yorick cried I what art thou doing here On the very first onset of all this glittering clatter thou art reduced to an atomseekseek some winding alley with a tourniquet at the end of it where chariot never rolled or flambeau shot its raysthere thou mayest solace thy soul in converse sweet with some kind  grisset  of a barber's wife and get into such coteries  May I perish if I do said I pulling out the letter which I had to present to Madame de R***I'll  wait upon this lady the very first thing I do So I called La Fleur to go seek me a barber directlyand come back and brush my coat  THE WIG  PARIS  WHEN the barber came he absolutely refused to have any thing to do with my wig 'twas either above or below his art I had nothing to do but to take one ready made of his own recommendation  But I fear friend said I this buckle won't standYou may immerge it replied he into the ocean and it will stand  What a great scale is every thing upon in this city thought IThe  utmost stretch of an English periwigmaker's ideas could have gone no further than to have  "dipped it into a pail of water"  What difference 'tis like time to eternity  I confess I do hate all cold conceptions as I do the puny ideas which engender them and am generally so struck with the great works of nature that for my own part if I could help it I never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least All that can be said against the French sublime in this instance of it is thisthat the grandeur is  more  in the  word  and  less  in the  thing  No doubt the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas  but Paris being so far inland it was not likely I should run post a hundred miles out of it to try the experimentthe Parisian barber meant nothing  The pail of water standing besides the great deep makes certainly but a sorry figure in speechbut 'twill be saidit has one advantage'tis in the next room and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado in a single moment  In honest truth and upon a more candid revision of the matter  The French expression professes more than it performs  I think I can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national characters more in these nonsensical  minutiae  than in the most important matters of state where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much alike that I would not give ninepence to chuse amongst them  I was so long in getting from under my barber's hands that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to Madame R*** that night but when a man is once dressed at all points for going out his reflections turn to little account so taking down the name of the Hotel de Modene where I lodged I  walked forth without any determination where to goI shall consider of that said I as I walk along  THE PULSE  PARIS  HAIL ye small sweet courtesies of life for smooth do ye make the road of it like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight 'tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in  Pray Madame said I have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opera comiqueMost willingly Monsieur said she laying aside her work  I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as I came  along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption till at last this hitting my fancy I had walked in  She was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door    Tres volentieres  most willingly said she laying her work down upon a chair next her and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in with so chearful a movement and so chearful a look that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her I should have said  "This woman is grateful"  You must turn Monsieur said she going with me to the door of the shop and pointing the way down the street I was to takeyou must turn first to your left hand  mais prenez guarde  there are two turns and be so good as to take the secondthen go down a little way and you'll see a church and when you are past it give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right and that will lead you to the foot of the  pont neuf  which you must crossand there any one will do himself the pleasure to shew you  She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natur'd patience the third time  as the firstand if  tones and manners  have a meaning which certainly they have unless to hearts which shut them outshe seem'd really interested that I should not lose myself  I will not suppose it was the woman's beauty notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisset I think I ever saw which had much to do with the sense I had of her courtesy only I remember when I told her how much I was obliged to her that I looked very full in her eyesand that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions  I had not got ten paces from the door before I found I had forgot  every tittle of what she had saidso looking back and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether I went right or notI returned back to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or leftfor that I had absolutely forgotIs it possible said she half laughing'Tis very possible replied I when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice  As this was the real truthshe took it as every woman takes a matter of right with a slight courtesy    Attendez  said she laying her hand upon my arm to detain me whilst she called a lad out of the  backshop to get ready a parcel of gloves I am just going to send him said she with a packet into that quarter and if you will have the complaisance to step in it will be ready in a moment and he shall attend you to the placeSo I walk'd in with her to the far side of the shop and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair as if I had a mind to sit she sat down herself in her low chair and I instantly sat myself down besides her  He will be ready Monsieur said she in a momentAnd in that moment replied I most willingly would I say something very civil to you for  all these courtesies Any one may do a casual act of good nature but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature and certainly added I if it is the same blood which comes from the heart which descends to the extremes touching her wrist I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the worldFeel it said she holding out her arm So laying down my hat I took hold of her fingers in one hand and applied the two forefingers of my other to the artery  Would to heaven my dear Eugenius thou hadst passed by and beheld me sitting in my black coat and in my lackadaysical manner  counting the throbs of it one by one with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her feverHow wouldst thou have laugh'd and moralized upon my new professionand thou shouldst have laugh'd and moralized onTrust me my dear Eugenius I should have said  "there are worse occupations in this world  than feeling a woman's pulse  "  But a Grisset's thou wouldst have saidand in an open shop Yorick  So much the better for when my views are direct Eugenius I care not if all the world saw me feel it  THE HUSBAND  PARIS  I HAD counted twenty pulsations and was going on fast towards the fortieth when her husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop put me a little out in my reckoning'Twas no body but her husband she saidso I began a fresh scoreMonsieur is so good quoth she as he pass'd by us as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulseThe husband took off his hat and making me a bow said I did him too much honourand having  said that he put on his hat and walk'd out  Good God said I to myself as he went outand can this man be the husband of this woman  Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation if I explain it to those who do not  In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh in the several endowments of mind and body sometimes the one sometimes the other has it so as in general to be upon a par and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do  In Paris there are scarce two orders of beings more different for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband he seldom comes therein some dark and dismal room behind he sits commerceless in his thrum nightcap the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him  The genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is  salique  having ceded this department with sundry others totally to the womenby a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a  bag by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles and not only become round and smooth but will receive some of them a polish like a brilliantMonsieur  le Mari  is little better than the stone under your foot  Surelysurely man it is not good for thee to sit alonethou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings and this improvement of our natures from it I appeal to as my evidence  And how does it beat Monsieur said sheWith all the benignity said I looking quietly in  her eyes that I expectedShe was going to say something civil in returnbut the lad came into the shop with the gloves  A propos  said I I want a couple of pair myself  THE GLOVES  PARIS  THE beautiful Grisset rose up when I said this and going behind the counter reach'd down a parcel and untied it I advanced to the side overagainst her they were all too large The beautiful Grisset measured them one by one across my handIt would not alter the dimensionsShe begg'd I would try a single pair which seemed to be the leastShe held it openmy hand slipp'd into it at onceIt will not do said I  shaking my head a littleNo said she doing the same thing  There are certain combined looks of simple subtletywhere whim and sense and seriousness and nonsense are so blended that all the languages of Babel set loose together could not express themthey are communicated and caught so instantaneously that you can scarce say which party is the infecter I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about itit is enough in the present to say again the gloves would not do so folding our hands within our arms we both loll'd upon the counterit was narrow and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us  The beautiful Grisset look'd sometimes at the gloves then sideways to the window then at the glovesand then at me I was not disposed to break silenceI follow'd her example so I look'd at the gloves then to the window then at the gloves and then at herand so on alternately  I found I lost considerably in every attackshe had a quick black eye and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration that she look'd into my very heart and reinsIt may seem strange but I could actually feel she did  It is no matter said I taking up a couple of the pairs next me and putting them into my pocket  I was sensible the beautiful Grisset had not ask'd above a single livre above the priceI wish'd she had ask'd a livre more and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter aboutDo you think my dear Sir said she mistaking my embarrassment that I could ask a  sous  too much of a strangerand of a stranger whose politeness more than his want of gloves has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy  Men croyez capable  Faith not I said I and if you were you are welcome  So counting the money into her hand and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeeper's wife I went out and her lad with his parcel followed me  THE TRANSLATION  PARIS  THERE was no body in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer I love the character not only because I honour the man whose manners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse but that I once knew onefor he is no moreand why should I not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it and telling the world it was Captain Tobias Shandy the dearest of my flock and friends whose philanthropy I never  think of at this long distance from his deathbut my eyes gush out with tears For his sake I have a predilection for the whole corps of veterans and so I strode over the two back rows of benches and placed myself beside him  The old officer was reading attentively a small pamphlet it might be the book of the opera with a large pair of spectacles As soon as I sat down he took his spectacles off and putting them into a shagreen case return'd them and the book into his pocket together I half rose up and made him a bow  Translate this into any civilized language in the worldthe sense is this  "Here's a poor stranger come in to the boxhe seems as if he knew no body and is never likely was he to be seven years in Paris if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose'tis shutting the door of conversation absolutely in his faceand using him worse than a German"  The French officer might as well have said it all aloud and if he had I should in course have put the bow I made him into French too and told him  "I was sensible of his attention  and return'd him a thousand thanks for it"  There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality as to get master of this  short hand  and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs with all their inflections and delineations into plain words For my own part by long habitude I do it so mechanically that when I walk the streets of London I go translating all the way and have more than once stood behind in the circle where not three words have been said and have brought off twenty different dialogues with me which I could have fairly wrote down and sworn to  I was going one evening to Martini's concert at Milan and was just entering the door of the hall when the Marquesina di F*** was coming out in a sort of a hurryshe was almost upon me before I saw her so I gave a spring to one side to let her passShe had done the same and on the same side too so we ran our heads together she instantly got to the other side to get out I was just as unfortunate as she had been for I had sprung to that side and opposed her passage againWe both flew together to the other side and then backand so onit was ridiculous we both blush'd intolerably so I did at last the thing I should have  done at firstI stood stock still and the Marquesina had no more difficulty I had no power to go into the room till I had made her so much reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the passageShe look'd back twice and walk'd along it rather sideways as if she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass herNo said Ithat's a vile translation the Marquesina has a right to the best apology I can make her and that opening is left for me to do it inso I ran and begg'd pardon for the embarrassment I had given her saying it was my intention to have made her way She answered she  was guided by the same intention towards meso we reciprocally thank'd each other She was at the top of the stairs and seeing no  chichesbee  near her I begg'd to hand her to her coachso we went down the stairs stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the adventureUpon my word Madame said I when I had handed her in I made six different efforts to let you go outAnd I made six efforts replied she to let you enterI wish to heaven you would make a seventh said IWith all my heart said she making roomLife is too short to be long about the forms of itso I instantly stepp'd in and she carried me home with herAnd  what became of the concert St Cecilia who I suppose was at it knows more than I  I will only add that the connection which arose out of that translation gave me more pleasure than any one I had the honour to make in Italy  THE DWARF  PARIS  I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life except by one and who that was will probably come out in this chapter so that being pretty much unprepossessed there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment I cast my eyes over the  parterre  and that was the unaccountable sport of nature in forming such numbers of dwarfsNo doubt she sports at certain times in almost every corner of the world but in Paris there is no  end to her amusementsThe goddess seems almost as merry as she is wise  As I carried my idea out of the  opera comique  with me I measured every body I saw walking in the streets by itMelancholy application especially where the size was extremely littlethe face extremely darkthe eyes quickthe nose longthe teeth whitethe jaw prominentto see so many miserables by force of accidents driven out of their own proper class into the very verge of another which it gives me pain to write downevery third man a pigmysome by ricketty heads and hump backs  others by bandy legsa third set arrested by the hand of Nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growtha fourth in their perfect and natural state like dwarf appletrees from the first rudiments and stamina of their existence never meant to grow higher  A medical traveller might say 'tis owing to undue bandagesa splenetic one to want of airand an inquisitive traveller to fortify the system may measure the height of their housesthe narrowness of their streets and in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such numbers of the  Bourgoisie  eat and sleep  together but I remember Mr Shandy the elder who accounted for nothing like any body else in speaking one evening of these matters averred that children like other animals might be increased almost to any size provided they came right into the world but the misery was the citizens of Paris were so coop'd up that they had not actually room enough to get themI do not call it getting any thing said he'tis getting nothingNay continued he rising in his argument 'tis getting worse than nothing when all you have got after twenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed upon  it shall not at last be as high as my leg Now Mr Shandy being very short there could be nothing more said upon it  As this is not a work of reasoning I leave the solution as I found it and content myself with the truth only of the remark which is verified in every lane and bylane of Paris I was walking down that which leads from the Carousal to the Palais Royal and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it I took hold of his hand and help'd him over Upon turning up his face to look at him after I perceived he was about  fortyNever mind said I some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety  I feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my species who have neither size or strength to get on in the worldI cannot bear to see one of them trod upon and had scarce got seated beside my old French officer ere the disgust was exercised by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in  At the end of the orchestra and betwixt that and the first sidebox  there is a small esplanade left where when the house is full numbers of all ranks take sanctuary Though you stand as in the parterre you pay the same price as in the orchestra A poor defenceless being of this order had got thrust some how or other into this luckless placethe night was hot and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself The dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides but the thing which incommoded him most was a tall corpulent German near seven feet high who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors The poor dwarf did all he could to get a  peep at what was going forwards by seeking for some little opening betwixt the German's arm and his body trying first one side then the other but the German stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imaginedthe dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest drawwell in Paris so he civilly reach'd up his hand to the German's sleeve and told him his distressThe German turn'd his head back look'd downupon him as Goliah did upon Davidand unfeelingly resumed his posture  I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk's little horn boxAnd how would thy meek and  courteous spirit my dear monk so temper'd to  bear and forbear  how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul's complaint  The old French officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion as I made the apostrophe took the liberty to ask me what was the matterI told him the story in three words and added how inhuman it was  By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes and in his first transports which are generally unreasonable had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knifeThe German look'd back coolly  and told him he was welcome if he could reach it  An injury sharpened by an insult be it to who it will makes every man of sentiment a party I could have leaped out of the box to have redressed itThe old French officer did it with much less confusion for leaning a little over and nodding to a centinel and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distressthe centinel made his way up to itThere was no occasion to tell the grievancethe thing told itself so thrusting back the German instantly with his muskethe took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him  before himThis is noble said I clapping my hands togetherAnd yet you would not permit this said the old officer in England  In England dear Sir said I  we sit all at our ease  The old French officer would have set me at unity with myself in case I had been at varianceby saying it was a  bon mot  and as a  bon mot  is always worth something at Paris he offered me a pinch of snuff  THE ROSE  PARIS  IT was now my turn to ask the old French officer  "What was the matter"  for a cry of  "  Haussez les mains Monsieur l'Abbe  "  reechoed from a dozen different parts of the parterre was as unintellgible to me as my apostrophe to the monk had been to him  He told me it was some poor Abbe in one of the upper loges who he supposed had got planted perdu behind a couple of grissets in  order to see the opera and that the parterre espying him were insisting upon his holding up both his hands during the representationAnd can it be supposed said I that an ecclesiastick would pick the Griffer's pockets The old French officer smiled and whispering in my car open'd a door of knowledge which I had no idea of  Good God said I turning pale with astonishmentis it possible that a people so smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean and so unlike themselves  Quelle grossierte  added I  The French officer told me it was an illiberal sarcasm at the church which had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in it by Molierebut like other remains os Gothic manners was decliningEvery nation continued he have their refinements and  grossiertes  in which they take the lead and lose it of one another by turnsthat he had been in most countries but never in one where he found not some delicacies which others seemed to want  Le  POUR  et le  CONTRE  se trouvent en chaque nation  there is a balance said he of good and bad every where and nothing but the knowing it is so can emancipate one half of the world  from the prepossessions which it holds against the otherthat the advantage of travel as it regarded the  sçavoir vivre  was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners it taught us mutual toleration and mutual toleration concluded he making me a bow taught us mutual love  The old French officer delivered this with an air of such candour and good sense as coincided with my first favourable impressions of his characterI thought I loved the man but I fear I mistook the object'twas my own way of thinkingthe difference was I could not have expressed it half so well  It is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beastif the latter goes pricking up his ears and starting all the way at every object which he never saw beforeI have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive and yet I honestly confess that many a thing gave me pain and that I blush'd at many a word the first monthwhich I found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second  Madame de Ramboulict after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of townOf all women Madame de Rambouliet is the most correct and I never wish to see one of  more virtues and purity of heartIn our return back Madame de Rambouliet desired me to pull the cordI ask'd her if she wanted any thing  Rien que pisser  said Madame de Rambouliet  Grieve not gentle traveller to let Madame de Rambouliet pss onAnd ye fair mystic nymphs go each one  pluck your rose  and scatter them in your pathfor Madame de Rambouliet did no moreI handed Madame de Rambouliet out of the coach and had I been the priest of the chaste CASTALIA I could not have served at her fountain with a more respectful decorum  END OF VOL I
