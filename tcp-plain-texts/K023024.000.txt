upon  DUKE  c  TO Lordings Proud I tune my SONG Who feast in Bow'r or Hall  Tho' Dukes they be Yet Dukes shall see that Pride will have a  Fall that Pride will have a Fall  I  TO Lordings Proud I tune my Song  Who Feast in Bow'r or Hall  Tho' Dukes they be yet Dukes shall see  That Pride will have a fall  II  Now that this same it is Right Sooth  Full plainly doth appear  From what befel  JOHN  DUKE OF  GUISE  And  NIC of  LANCASTERE  III  When  Richard Coeur de Lyon  Reign'd  which means a  Lyon's Heart    Like him his Barons rag'd and roar'd  Each play'd a Lyon's Part  IV  A Word and Blow was then enough  Such Honour did them Prick  If you but turn'd your Cheek a Cuff  And if your A  e a Kick  V  Look in their Face they tweak'd your Nose  At every turn fell to't  Come near they trode upon your Toes  They fought from Head to Foot  VI  Of these the  Duke  of  Lancastere  Stood Paramount in Pride  He kick'd and cuff'd and tweak'd and trode  His Foes and  Friends  beside  VII  Firm on his Front his Beaver sate  So broad it hid his Chin  For why he thought no Man his Mate  And fear'd to Tan his Skin  VIII  With  Spanish  Wool he dy'd his Cheek  With Essence oyl'd his Hair  No vixen Civet Cat more Sweet  Nor more could Scratch and Tear  IX  Right Tall  he made himself to show  Tho' made  full short  by G  d  And when  all other  Dukes did  Bow  This Duke  did only  Nod  X  Yet Courteous Blith and Debonaire  To  GUISE's  DUKE was he  Never was such a Loving Pair  Why did they disagree  XI  Oh thus it was he lov'd him dear  And cast how to requite him  And having no Friend left but This  He deem'd it meet to  fight him  XII  Forthwith he drench'd his desperate Quill  And thus he did Indite  This Eve at Wisk  OUR SELF  will Play  Sir  Duke  Be here to Night  XIII  Ah no ah no  the Guileless  GUISE  Demurely did reply  I cannot Go nor yet can Stand  So sore the Gout have I  XIV  The DUKE in Wrath call'd for his Steeds  And fiercely drove them on  Lord Lord how rattled then thy Stones  O  Kingly Kensington  XV  All in a Trice on  GUISE  he rush'd  Thrust out his Lady Dear  He tweak'd his Nose trod on his Toes  And smote him on the Ear  XVI  But mark how midst of Victory  Fate shews an  Old DogTrick  Up leap'd DUKE  JOHN  and knock'd him down  And so down fell DUKE  NIC  XVII  Alass Oh  NIC  Oh  NIC  alass  Right did thy Gossip call thee  As who should say  Alass the Day  When JOHN  of  GUISE shall maul thee  XVIII  For on thee did he clap his Chair  And on that Chair did sit  And look'd as if he meant therein  To do  what was not fit  XIX  Up didst thou look Oh woful DUKE  Thy Mouth yet durst not ope  Certes  for Fear of finding there  A T  d instead of Trope  XX  "  Lye there thou Caitiff vile quoth GUISE  "  No  Sheet  is here to save thee  "  The Casememt it is shut likewise  "  Beneath my Feet I have thee  XXI  "  If thou hast ought to say now speak  Then  Lancaster  did cry  " Knowest thou not ME not yet thy self  " Who Thou and WHO AM I  XXII  " Know'st Thou not ME who God be prais'd  " have bawl'd and quarell'd more  " Than all the Line of  Lancaster  " That battled heretofore  XXIII  " In Senates fam'd for many a Speech  " And what some Awe must give Ye  " Tho' laid thus low beneath thy Breech  " Still of the Council Privy  XXIV  " Still of the Dutchy Chancellor  "  Durante  Life I have it  " And turn as now thou dost on me  " My A  e on those that gave it  XXV  But now the Servants they rush'd in  And DUKE  NIC  up leap'd He  I will not cope against such Odds  But  GUISE I'll fight with Thee  XXVI  To Morrow with Thee will I fight  Under the Greenwood Tree  No not to Morrow but to Night  Quoth GUISE  I'll fight with Thee  XXVII  And now the Sun declining low  Bestreak'd with Blood the Skies  When with his Sword at Saddle Bow  Rode forth the Valiant  GUISE  XXVIII  Full gently praunc'd he on the Lawn  Oft rowl'd his Eye around  And from his Sirrup stretch'd to find  Who was not to be found  XXIX  Long brandish'd he his Blade in Air  Long look'd the Field all o're  At length he spy'd the merry Men brown  And eke the Coach and Four  XXX  From out the Boot bold  NICHOLAS  Did wave his Hand so white  As pointing out the gloomy Glade  Whereat he meant to fight  XXXI  All in that dreadful Hour so calm  Was  Lancaster  to see  As if he meant to take the Air  Or only take a Fee  XXXII  And so he did for to  New Court  His trowling Wheels they run  Not that he shunn'd the doubtful Strife  But Business must be done  XXXIII  Back in the dark by  Brompton  Park  He turn'd up thro' the Gore  So slunk to  Campden  House so high  All in his Coach and four  XXXIV  Mean while the  GUISE  did fret and fume  A Sight it was to see  Benumm'd beneath the Evening Dew  Under the Greenwood Tree  XXXV  Then wet and weary home he far'd  Sore mutt'ring all the Way  The Day I meet NIC  he shall rue  The Cudgel of that Day  XXXVI  Mean time on every pissing Post  Paste me this Recreant's Name  So that each Pisserby shall read  And piss against the same  XXXVII  Now God preserve our GRACIOUS KING  And grant his Nobles all  May learn this Lesson from  Duke Nic  That  Pride will have a Fall  FINIS
