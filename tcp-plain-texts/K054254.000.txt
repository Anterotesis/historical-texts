 AN ESSAY ON The  Usefulness  of MATHEMATICAL LEARNING  AN ESSAY ON The  Usefulness  of MATHEMATICAL LEARNING IN A Letter from a  Gentleman  in the CITY to his  Friend  in  OXFORD  Printed at the THEATER in  Oxford  for  Anth Peisley  Bookseller  Imprimatur  RO MANDER  ViceCan  Oxon  January  AN ESSAY ON The  Usefulness  of MATHEMATICAL LEARNING  c  SIR  I AM glad to hear from you that the study of the  Mathematicks  is Promoted and Encouraged among the  Youth  of your  Ʋniversity  The great influence which these  Sciences  have on Philosophy and all useful Learning as well as the Concerns of the Publick may sufficiently recommend them to your choice and consideration and the particular advantages which You of that place enjoy give Us just reason to expect from You a suitable improvement in them I have here sent you some short reflections upon the  Ʋsefulness  of  Mathematical Learning  which may serve as an argument to incite you to a closer and more vigorous pursuit of it  In all Ages and Countries where Learning hath prevailed the  Mathematical Sciences  have been looked upon as the most considerable branch of it The very name  implies no less by which they were called either for their excellency or because of all the  Sciences  they were first taught or because they were judg'd to comprehend  And amongst those that are commonly reckoned to be the seven Liberal Arts four are Mathematical to wit  Arithmetick Musick Geometry  and  Astronomy  But notwithstanding their Excellency and Reputation they have not been taught nor study'd so universally as some of the rest which I take to have proceeded from the following causes The  aversion of the greatest part of Mankind to serious attention and close arguing  Their  not comprehending sufficiently the necessity or great usefulness of these in other parts of Learning  An  Opinion that this study requires a particular Genius and turn of Head which few are so happy as to be Born with  And  the want of Publick Encouragement and able Masters  For these and perhaps some other reasons this study hath been  generally neglected and regarded only by some few persons whose happy Genius and Curiosity have prompted them to it or who have been forced upon it by its immediate subserviency to some particular Art or Office  Therefore I think I cannot do better service to Learning Youth and the Nation in general than by shewing  That the Mathematicks of all parts of humane knowledge for the improvement of the Mind for their subserviency to other Arts and their usefulness to the Commonwealth deserve most to be encouraged  I know a discourse of this nature will be offensive to some who while they are ignorant of Mathematicks yet think themselves Masters of all valuable Learning but their displeasure must not deterr me from delivering an useful truth  The advantages which accrue to the Mind by  Mathematical  studies consist chiefly in these things  st  In accustoming it to  attention dly  In giving it a habit of  close  and  demonstrative reasoning dly  In freeing it from  prejudice credulity  and  superstition  First the Mathematicks make the Mind attentive to the objects which it  considers This they do by entertaining it with a great variety of truths which are delightful and evident but not obvious Truth is the same thing to the understanding as Musick to the ear and Beauty to the eye The pursuit of it does really as much gratifie a natural faculty implanted in us by our wise Creator as the pleasing of our Senses only in the former case as the Object and Faculty are more Spiritual the delight is the more pure free from the regret turpitude lassitude and intemperance that commonly attend sensual pleasures The most part of other  Sciences  consisting only of probable reasonings the Mind has not where to fix and wanting sufficient principles to pursue its searches upon gives them over as impossible Again as in  Mathematical investigations  truth may be found so it is not always  obvious  This spurs the Mind and makes it diligent and attentive  In Geometria  says Quinctilian lib I cap  partem fatentur esse utilem teneris aetatibus agitari namque animos atque acui ingenia celeritatem percipiendi venire inde concedunt  And  Plato  in  Repub lib  VII observes that the Youth who  are furnished with  Mathematical  knowledge are prompt and quick at all other  Sciences  Therefore he calls it  And indeed Youth is generally so much more delighted with  Mathematical  studies than with the unpleasant tasks that are some times imposed upon them that I have known some reclaimed by them from idleness and neglect of learning and acquire in time a habit of thinking diligence and attention qualities which we ought to study by all means to beget in their desultory and roving Minds  The second advantage which the Mind reaps from  Mathematical  knowledge is a habit of  clear demonstrative  and  methodical  Reasoning We are contriv'd by Nature to learn by Imitation more than by Precept And I believe in that respect Reasoning is much like other inferiour Arts as  Dancing Singing  c acquired by practice By accustoming our selves to Reason closely about quantity we acquire a habit of doing so in other things It is surprizing to see what superficial inconsequential Reasonings satisfie the most part of Mankind  A piece of wit a jest a simile or a quotation of an Author passes for a mighty Argument with such things as these are the most part of Authors stuffed and from these weighty premises they infer their conclusions This weakness and effeminacy of Mankind in being perswaded where they are delighted have made them the sport of Orators Poets and Men of wit Those  lumina Orationis  are indeed very good diversion for the Fancy but are not the proper business of the Understanding and where a Man pretends to write on abstract subjects in a Scientifical method he ought not to debauch in them Logical precepts are more useful nay they are absolutely necessary for a rule of formal arguing in publick disputations and confounding an obstinate and perverse adversary and exposing him to the audience or readers But in the search of truth an imitation of the method of the  Geometers  will carry a Man further than all the  Dialectical  rules Their  Analysis  is the proper model we ought to form our selves upon and imitate in the regular disposition and gradual progress of our enquiries and even  he who is ignorant of the nature of  Mathematical Analysis  uses a method somewhat Analogous to it The  Composition  of the  Geometers  or their method of demonstrating truths already found out viz  by Definitions of words agreed upon by Selfevident truths and Propositions that have been already demonstrated  is practicable in other subjects tho' not to the same perfection the natural want of evidence in the things themselves not allowing it but it is imitable to a considerable degree I dare appeal to some writings of our own Age and Nation the Authors of which have been Mathematically inclined I shall add no more on this head but that one who is accustomed to the methodical Systems of truths which the  Geometers  have reared up in the several branches of those  Sciences  which they have cultivated will hardly bear with the confusion and disorder of other  Sciences  but endeavour as far as he can to reform them  Thirdly  Mathematical  knowledge adds a manly vigour to the Mind frees it from  prejudice credulity  and  superstition  This it does two ways  st  by accustoming us to examine and not to take things  upon trust  dly  By giving us a clear and extensive knowledge of the System of the World which as it creates in us the most profound reverence of the Almighty and wise Creator so it frees us from the mean and narrow thoughts which ignorance and superstition are apt to beget How great an enemy  Mathematicks  are to superstition appears from this That in those Countries where  Romish Priests  exercise their barbarous Tyranny over the minds of Men  Astronomers  who are fully perswaded of the motion of the Earth dare not speak out But tho the  Inquisition  may extort a Recantation the Pope and a general Council too will not find themselves able to perswade to the contrary Opinion Perhaps this may have given occasion to a calumnious suggestion as if  Mathematicks  were an enemy to Religion which is a scandal thrown both on the one and the other for truth can never be an enemy to true Religion which appears always to the best advantage when it is most examined  Si propiùs stes  Te capiet magis  On the contrary the  Mathematicks  are  friends to Religion inasmuch as they charm the passions restrain the impetuosity of imagination and purge the Mind from error and prejudice Vice is error confusion and false Reasoning and all truth is more or less opposite to it Besides  Mathematical  studies may serve for a pleasant entertainment for those hours which young Men are apt to throw away upon their Vices the delightfulness of them being such as to make solitude not only easy but desirable  What I have said may serve to recommend  Mathematicks  for acquiring a vigorous Constitution of Mind for which purpose they are as useful as exercise is for procuring Health and Strength to the Body I proceed now to shew their vast extent and Usefulness in other parts of knowledge And here it might suffice to tell you that  Mathematicks  is the  Science  of quantity or the  Art  of Reasoning about things that are capable of  more  and  less  and that the most part of the objects of our knowledge are such as matter space number time motion gravity c We have but imperfect ideas of things without quantity and as imperfect a one of quantity it self without  the help of  Mathematicks  All the visible works of God Almighty are made in  number weight  and  measure  therefore to consider them we ought to understand  Arithmetick Geometry  and  Staticks  and the greater advances we make in those Arts the more capable we are of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our Conceptions But this will farther appear from particulars  And first if we consider to what perfection we now know the Courses Periods Order Distances and Proportions of the several great Bodies of the Universe at least such as fall within our view we shall have cause to admire the Sagacity and Industry of the  Mathematicians  and the power of  Numbers  and  Geometry  well apply'd Let us cast our Eyes backward and consider  Astronomy  in its Infancy or rather let us suppose it still to begin for instance a Colony of Rude Country people transplanted into an Island remote from the commerce of all Mankind without so much as the knowledge of the Kalendar and the Periods of the Seasons without Instruments to make Observations or any the least notion of Observations or Instruments When is it  we could expect any of their posterity should arrive at the Art of predicting an Eclipse Not only so but the Art of reckoning all Eclipses that are past or to come for any number of Years When is it we could suppose that one of those Islanders transported to any other place of the Earth should be able by the inspection of the Heavens to find how much he were South or North East or West of his own Island and to conduct his Ship back thither For my part tho' I know this may be and is daily done by what is known in  Astronomy  yet when I consider the vast Industry Sagacity multitude of Observations and other extrinsick things necessary for such a sublime piece of knowledge I should be apt to pronounce it impossible and never to be hoped for Now we are let so much into the knowledge of the Machine of the Universe and motion of its parts by the Rules of this  Science  perhaps the invention may seem easy But when we reflect what Penetration and Contrivance were necessary to lay the foundations of so great and extensive an Art we cannot but admire its first Inventors as  Thales Milesius  who as  Diogenes Laertius  and  Pliny  say first predicted Eclipses and his Scholar  Anaximander Milesius  who found out the Globous Figure of the Earth the Aequinoctial Points the Obliquity of the Ecliptick the principles of Gnomonicks and made the first Sphere or Image of the Heavens and  Pythagoras  to whom we owe the discovery of the true System of the World and order of the Planets Tho' it may be they were assisted by the  Egyptians  and  Chaldeans  But whoever they were that first made these bold steps in this Noble Art they deserve the praise and admiration of all future Ages  Felices animae quibus haec cognoscere primis  Inque domos superas scandere cura fuit  Credibile est illos pariter vitiisque jocisque  Altius humanis exseruisse caput  Non Venus vinum sublimia pectora fregit  Officiumque fori militiaeque labor  Non levis ambitio perfusaque gloria fuco  Magnarumque fames sollicitavit opum  Admovere oculis distantia sidera nostris  Aetheraque ingenio supposuere suo  Ovid in I  o  Fast  But tho' the industry of former Ages had discovered the Periods of the great  Bodies of the Universe and the true System and Order of them and their Orbits pretty near yet was there one thing still reserved for the glory of this Age and the honour of the  English Nation  The grand secret of the whole Machine which now it is discovered proves to be like the other contrivances of Infinite Wisdom simple and natural depending upon the most known and most common property of matter viz  gravity  From this the incomparable M  r    Newton  has demonstrated the Theories of all the Bodies of the Solar System of all the primary Planets and their secondaries and among others the Moon which seem'd most averse to numbers And not only of the Planets the slowest of which compleats its Period in less than half the Age of a Man but likewise of the Comets some of which its probable spend more than years in one Revolution about the Sun for whose Theory he has laid such a foundation that after Ages assisted with more Observations may be able to Calculate their returns In a word the precession of the Aequinoctial Points the Tydes the unequal Vibration of Pendulous Bodies in different Latitudes  c are no more a question to those that have  Geometry  enough to understand what he has delivered on those Subjects A perfection in  Philosophy  that the boldest thinker durst hardly have hoped for and unless Mankind turn barbarous will continue the Reputation of this Nation as long as the Fabrick of Nature shall endure After this what is it we may not expect from  Geometry  join'd to  Observations  and  Experiments  The next considerable object of Natural knowledge I take to be  Light  How unsuccessful enquiries are about this Glorious Body without the help of  Geometry  may appear from the empty and frivolous discourses and disputations of a sort of Men that call themselves  Philosophers  whom nothing will serve forsooth but the knowledge of the very Nature and intimate Causes of every thing while on the other hand the  Geometers  not troubling themselves with those fruitless enquiries about the  Nature  of  Light  have discovered two remarkable properties of it in the reflection and refraction of its beams and from those and their streightness in other cases have invented the noble  Arts of  Opticks Catoptricks  and  Dioptricks  teaching us to manage this subtile Body for the improvement of our knowledge and useful purposes of Life They have likewise demonstrated the causes of several Coelestial appearances that arise from the inflection of its Beams both in the Heavenly Bodies themselves and other Phoenomena as  Parhelia  the  Iris  c and by a late Experiment they have discovered the celerity of its motion And we shall know yet more surprizing properties of  Light  when M  r    Newton  shall be pleas'd to gratifie the World with his  Book of Light and Colours  The  Fluids  which involve our Earth viz  Air  and  Water  are the next great and conspicuous Bodies that Nature presents to our view And I think we know little of either but what is owing to  Mechanicks  and  Geometry  The two chiefest properties of  Air  its Gravity and Elastick force have been discovered by Mechanical Experiments From thence the decrease of the Air's density according to the increase of the distance of the Earth has been demonstrated by  Geometers  and confirmed by Experiments of the subsidence of the  Mercury  in the  Torricellian Experiment  From this likewise by assistance of  Geometry  they have determined the height of the Atmosphere as far as it has any sensible density which agrees exactly with another Observation of the duration of the Twilight  Air  and  Water  make up the object of the  Hydrostaticks  tho' denominated only from the latter of which the principles were long since settled and demonstrated by  Archimedes  in his Book  where are demonstrated the causes of several surprizing Phoenomena of Nature depending only on the  Aequilibrium  of  Fluids  the relative Gravities of these  Fluids  and of Solids swimming or sinking therein Here also the Mathematicians consider the different Pressures Resistances and Celerities of Solids moved in Fluids from whence they explain a great many appearances of Nature unintelligible to those who are ignorant of  Geometry  Next if we descend to the  Animal Kingdom  there we may see the brightest strokes of Divine Mechanicks And whither we consider first the  Animal Oeconomy  in general either in the internal motion and circulation of the Juices forced  through the several Canals by the motion of the Heart or their external motions and the Instruments wherewith these are performed we must reduce them to Mechanical Rules and confess the necessity of the knowledge of Mechanicks to understand them or explain them to others  Borelli  in his excellent Treatise  de motu Animalium Steno  in his admirable  Myologiae specimen  and other Mathematical Men on the one hand and the nonsensical unintelligible stuff that the common Writers on these Subjects have filled their Books with on the other are sufficient instances to shew how necessary  Geometry  is in such speculations The only Organ of an Animal Body whose structure and manner of operation is fully understood has been the only one which the  Geometers  have taken to their share to consider It's incredible how sillily the greatest and ablest Physicians talked of the parts of the Eye and their use and of the  modus visionis  before  Kepler  by his  Geometry  found it out and put it past dispute tho' they apply'd themselves particularly to this and valued themselves on it and  Galen  pretended a particular Divine Commission  to treat of it Nay notwithstanding the full discovery of it some go on in copying their Predecessors and talk as  Ʋngeometrically  as ever It's true we cannot reason so clearly of the internal motions of an Animal Body as of the external wanting sufficient  data  and decisive Experiments But what relates to the latter as the Articulation Structure Insertion and  Vires  of the Muscles is as subject to strict Mathematical disquisition as any thing whatsoever and even in the Theory of Diseases and their Cures those who talk Mechanically talk most intelligibly Which may be the reason for the Opinion of the ancient Physicians that Mathematicks are necessary for the study of Medicine it self for which I could bring long quotations out of their works Among the Letters that are ascrib'd to  Hippocrates  there is one to his Son  Thessalus  recommending to him the study of  Arithmetick  and  Geometry  as necessary to Medicine  Galen  in his Book intituled  begins  If one of the reasons of the Ancients for this be now somewhat unfashionable to wit because they thought a Physician should be able to know the situation and aspects of the Stars which they believed had influence upon Men and their Diseases and positively to deny it and say that they have none at all is the effect of want of Observation we have a much better and undoubted one in its room  viz  That Mathematicks are found to be the best Instrument of promoting natural knowledge  dly  If we consider not only the Animal Oeconomy in general but likewise the wonderful structure of the different sorts of Animals according to the different purposes for which they were design'd the various Elements they inhabit the several ways of procuring their nourishment and propagating their kind the different enemies they have and accidents they are subject to here is  still a greater need of  Geometry  It is pity that the qualities of an expert  Anatomist  and skillful  Geometer  have seldom met in the same person When such a one shall appear there is a whole  Terra incognita  of delightful knowledge to employ his time and reward his industry  As for the other two Kingdoms  Borelli  and other  Mathematical Men  seem to have talked very clearly of  Vegetation  and  Steno  another Mathematician in his excellent Treatise  de Solido intra Solidum naturaliter contento  has apply'd this part of learning very handsomely to  Fossils  and some other parts of Natural History I shall add only one thing more That if we consider motion it self the great Instrument of the Actions of Bodies upon one another the Theory of it is entirely owing to the  Geometers  who have demonstrated its Laws both in hard and elastick Bodies shew'd how to measure it's quantity how to compound and resolve the several forces by which Bodies are agitated and to determine the  Lines  which those compound forces make them describe of such forces gravity being the most constant and uniform affords a great variety of useful knowledge  in considering several motions that happen upon the Earth  viz  As to the free descent of heavy Bodies The curve of projectiles The descent and weight of heavy Bodies when they lye on inclined plains The Theory of the motion of Pendulous Bodies c  From what I have said I shall draw but one Corollary That a natural Philosopher without Mathematicks is a very odd sort of a person that reasons about things that have  Bulk Figure Motion Number Weight  c without  Arithmetick Geometry Mechanicks Staticks  c I must needs say I have the last contempt for those Gentlemen that pretend to explain how the Earth was framed and yet can hardly measure an Acre of Ground upon the surface of it And as the Philosopher speaks  Qui repente pedibus illotis ad Philosophos divertunt non hoc est satis quod sint omninò  sed legem etiam dant quâ Philosophari discant  The usefulness of  Mathematicks  in several other Arts and Sciences is fully as plain They were looked upon by the ancient Philosophers as the key to all knowledge Therefore  Plato  wrote upon  his School    Let none unskilled in Geometry enter  and  Xenocrates  told one ignorant in  Mathematicks  who desired to be his Scholar that he was fitter to Card Wooll    you want the handle of Philosophy  viz  Geometry  There is no understanding the works of the ancient Philosophers without it  Theo Smyrnoeus  has wrote a Book entituled An explanation of those things in Mathematicks that are necessary for the reading of  Plato Aristotle  illustrates his precepts and other thoughts by Mathematical examples and that not only in  Logick  c but even in  Ethicks  where he makes use of Geometrical and Arithmetical proportion to explain commutative and distributive justice  Every body knows that  Chronology  and  Geography  are indispensable preparations for History a relation of matter of fact being a very lifeless insipid thing without the circumstances of time and place Nor is it sufficient for one that would understand things thoroughly that he knows the Topography that is the name of the Country where such a place lies with those of the near adjacent  places and how these lie in respect of one another but it will become him likewise to understand the Scientifical principles of the Art that is to have a true Idea of a place we ought to know the relation it has to any other place as to the distance and bearing its Climate Heat Cold length of days c which things do much enliven the Readers notion of the very action it self Just so it is necessary to know the Technical or Doctrinal part of Chronology if a Man would be throughly skill'd in History it being impossible without it to unravel the confusion of Historians I remember M  r    Hally  has determin'd the day and hour of  Julius Coesar's  Landing in  Britain  from the circumstances of his relation And every body knows how great use our incomparable Historian M  r    Dodwell  has made of the Calculated times of Eclipses for settling the times of great Events which before were as to this essential circumstance almost fabulous Both  Chronology  and  Geography  and also the knowledge of the Sun's and Moon's motions so far as they relate to the constitution of the Kalendar and Year are necessary to a Divine and how sadly  some otherwise Eminent have blunder'd when they meddled with things that relate to these and border on them is too apparent  No body I think will question the interest that Mathematicks have in  Painting Musick  and  Architecture  which are all founded on numbers Perspective and the Rules of Light and Shadows are owing to  Geometry  and  Opticks  And I think those two comprehend pretty near the whole Art of  Painting  except  decorum  and  ordinance  which are only a due observance of the History and Circumstances of the subject you represent For by Perspective may be understood the Art of designing the outlines of your solid whether that be a Building Landskip or Animal and the draught of a Man is really as much the Perspective of a Man as the draught of a Building is of a Building tho' for particular reasons as because it consists of more crooked lines c it is hard to reduce the Perspective of the former to the ordinary established Rules  If  Mathematicks  had not reduced  Musick  to a regular System by contriving its  Scales  it had been no Art but Enthusiastick  Rapture left to the roving fancy of every Practitioner This appears by the extraordinary pains which the Ancients have taken to fit numbers to three sorts of Musick the  Diatonick Chromatick  and  Enharmonick  which if we consider with their nicety in distinguishing their several  Modes  we shall be apt to judge they had something very fine in their  Musick  at least for moving the passions with single Instruments and Voices But  Musick  had been imperfect still had not  Arithmetick  stepped in once more and  Guido Aretinus  by inventing the temperament making the Fifth false by a certain determined quantity taught us to Tune our Organs and intermix all the three kinds of the Ancients to which we owe all the Regular and Noble Harmony of our modern  Musick  As for  Civil Architecture  of Military I shall speak afterwards there is hardly any part of  Mathematicks  but is some way subservient to it  Geometry  and  Arithmetick  for the due measure of the several parts of a Building the Plans Models computation of Materials time and charges for ordering right its Arches and Vaults that they may be  both firm and beautiful  Mechanicks  for its strength and firmness transporting and raising materials and  Opticks  for the Symmetry and Beauty And I would not have any assume the character of an  Architect  without a competent skill in all of these You see that  Vitruvius  requires these and many more for making a compleat  Architect  I must own that should any one set up to practice in any of the forementioned Arts furnished only with his Mathematical Rules he would produce but very clumsy pieces He that should pretend to draw by the Geometrical Rules of Perspective or Compose  Musick  meerly by his skill in Harmonical numbers would shew but aukward performances In those Compos'd Subjects besides the stiff Rules there must be Fancy Genius and Habit Yet nevertheless these Arts owe their being to  Mathematicks  as laying the foundation of their Theory and affording them Precepts which being once invented are securely rely'd upon by Practitioners Thus many design that know not a  ittle of the reason of the Rules they practice b  and many no better quality  in their way Compose  Musick  better perhaps than he could have done that invented the  Scale  and the  Numbers  upon which their Harmony is founded As  Mathematicks  laid the foundation of these Arts so they must improve them and he that would invent must be skill'd in Numbers Besides it is fit a Man should know the true grounds and reasons of what he studies and he that does so will certainly practice in his Art with greater judgement and variety where the ordinary Rules fail him  I proceed now to shew the more immediate usefulness of  Mathematicks  in  Civil Affairs  To begin with  Arithmetick  it were an endless task to relate its several uses in publick and private business The regulation and quick dispatch of both seem intirely owing to it The Nations that want it are altogether barbarous as some  Americans  who can hardly reckon above twenty And I believe it would go near to ruine the Trade of the Nation were the easy practice of  Arithmetick  abolished for example were the Merchants and Tradesmen oblig'd to make use of no other than the  Roman  way of notation by Letters instead of our present And if we should feel the  want of our  Arithmetick  in the easiest Calculations how much more in those that are some thing harder as Interest simple and compound Annuities c in which it is incredible how much the ordinary Rules and Tables influence the dispatch of business  Arithmetick  is not only the great Instrument of private Commerce but by it are or ought to be kept the publick Accounts of a Nation I mean those that regard the whole State of a Commonwealth as to the number fructification of its people increase of Stock improvement of Lands and Manufactures Ballance of Trade Publick Revenues Coynage Military power by Sea and Land c Those that would judge or reason truely about the State of any Nation must go that way to work subjecting all the forementioned particulars to Calculation This is the true  Political  knowledge In this respect the affairs of a Commonwealth differ from those of a private Family only in the greatness and multitude of particulars that make up the accounts  Machiavel  goes this way to work in his account of different Estates What Sir  William Petty  and several others of our  Countrymen have wrote in  Political Arithmetick  does abundantly shew the pleasure and usefulness of such Speculations It is true for want of good information their Calculations some times proceed upon erroneous suppositions but that is not the fault of the Art But what is it the Government could not perform in this way who have the command of all publick Records  Lastly Numbers are applicable even to such things as seem to be govern'd by no rule I mean such as depend on  Chance  The quantity of probability and proportion of it in any two proposed cases being subject to Calculation as much as any thing else Upon this depend the principles of Game We find Sharpers know enough of this to cheat some men that would take it very ill to be thought Bubbles And one Gamester exceeds another as he has a greater sagacity and readiness in Calculating his probability to win or lose in any proposed case To understand the Theory of  Chance  throughly requires a great knowledge of Numbers and a pretty competent one of  Algebra  The several uses of  Geometry  are not much fewer than those of  Arithmetick  It is necessary for ascertaining of property both in Plains and Solids or in Surveying and Guaging By it Land is sold by the measure as well as Cloth Workmen are pay'd the due price of their labour according to the superficial or solid measure of their work and the quantity of liquors determined for a due regulation of their price and duty All which do wonderfully conduce to the easy dispatch of business and the preventing of frauds and controversies I need not mention the Measuring distances laying down of Plans and Maps of Countries in which we have daily Experience of its usefulness These are some familiar instances of things to which  Geometry  is ordinarily apply'd of its use in  Civil Military  and  Naval Architecture  we shall speak afterwards  From  Astronomy  we have the regular disposition of our time in a due succession of years which are kept within their limits as to the return of the Seasons and the motion of the Sun This is no small advantage for the due repetition of the same work Labour and Actions For many of our Publick Private Military and Country Affairs Appointments  c depending on the products of the Ground and they on the Seasons It is necessary that the returns of them be adjusted pretty near to the motion of the Sun and we should quickly find the inconveniency of a  vague  undetermined year if we used that of the  Mahumetans  whose beginning and every month wanders through all the days of ours or the Solar year which shews the Seasons Beside the adjusting of the Moon's motion to the Sun's is required for the decent Observation and Celebration of the  ChurchFeasts  and  Fasts  according to the Ancient Custom and Primitive Institution and likewise for the knowing of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Tides the Spring and Neap Tides Currents c So that whatever some people may think of an  Almanack  where all these are set down it is oftentimes the most useful paper that is published the same year with it Nay the Nation could better spare all the Voluminous Authors in the  TermCatalogue  than that single sheet Besides without a regular Chronology there can be no certain History which appears by the confusion amongst Historians before the right disposition  of the year and at present among the  Turks  who have the same confusion in their History as in their Kalendar Therefore a matter of such importance might well deserve the care of the  Great Emperour  to whom we owe our present Kalendar who was himself a great proficient in  Astronomy Pliny  has quoted several things from his Books of the  Rising  and  Setting  of the Stars  Lib  XVIII  cap  c and  Lucan  makes him say  Media inter praelia semper  Stellarum Coelique plagis superisque vacavi  The  Mechanicks  have produced so many useful Engines subservient to conveniency that it would be a task too great to relate the several sorts of them some of them keep Life it self from being a burden If we consider such as are invented for raising weights and are employ'd in Building and other great works in which no impediment is too great for them or  Hydraulick  Engines for raising of Water serving for great use and comfort to Mankind where they have no other way to be supply'd readily with that necessary Element or such as by making  Wind and Water work for us save Animal force and great charges and perform those actions which require a vast multitude of hands and without which every Man's time would be too little to prepare his own Aliment and other necessaries or those Machines that have been invented by Mankind for delight and curiosity imitating the motions of Animals or other works of Nature we shall have reason to admire and extoll so excellent an Art What shall we say of the several Instruments which are contriv'd to measure time We should quickly find the value of them if we were reduced to the condition of those barbarous Nations that want them The  PendulumClock  invented and compleated by that famous  Mathematician  Monsieur  Hugens  is an useful invention Is there any thing more wonderful than several  Planetary Machines  which have been invented to shew the motions of the Heavenly Bodies and their places at any time Of which the most Ingenious according to the exactest Numbers and true System was made by the same M  Hugens  to which we may very justly apply  Claudian's  noble Verses upon that of  Archimedes  Jupiter in parvo cum cerneret Aethera vitro  Risit ad superos talia dicta dedit  Huttine mortalis progressa potentia curae  Jam meus in fragili luditur or be labor  Jura poli rerumque fidem legesque Deorum  Ecce Syracusais transtulit arte senex  Inclusus variis famulatur spiritus astris  Et vioum certis motibus urget opus  Percurrit proprium mentitus signifer annum  Et simulata novo Cynthia mense redit  Jam{que} suum volvens audax industria mundum  Gaudet humanâ sidera mente regit  Quid falso insontem tonitru Salmonea miror  Aemula naturae parva reperta manus  Here I ought to mention the  Sciatherical  Instruments for want of which there was a time when the  Grecians  themselves were forced to measure the Shadow in order to know the Hour and as  Pliny    cap ult lib  VII tells us the  Romans  made use of an erroneous Sundial for ninety nine years till  Q Marcius Philippus  their Censor set up a better which no doubt at that time was thought a Jewel And at last that famous Pyramid was set up in the  Campus Martius  to serve for a Gnomon to a Dial marked on the  street To this sort of Engines ought to be referred  Spheres Globes Astrolabes Projections of the Sphere  c These are such useful and necessary things that alone may recommend the Art by which they are made For by these we are able in our Closet to judge of the Celestial motions and to visit the most distant places of the Earth without the fatigue and danger of Voyages to determine concerning their distance Situation Climate Nature of the Seasons length of their days and their relation to the Celestial Bodies as much as if we were Inhabitants To all these I might add those Instruments which the  Mathematicians  have invented to execute their own precepts for making  Observations  either at Sea or Land  Surveying Gauging  c  The  Catoptricks  and  Dioptricks  furnish us with variety of useful inventions both for the promoting of knowledge and the conveniencies of Life whereby Sight the great Instrument of our perception is so much improv'd that neither the distance nor the minuteness of the Object are any more impediments to it The  Telescope  is of so vast use that besides the delightful and useful purposes  it is apply'd to here below as the descrying Ships and Men and Armies at a distance we have by its means discovered new parts of the Creation fresh instances of the surprizing Wisdom of the Adorable Creator We have by it discovered the  Satellites  of  Jupiter  the  Satellites  and  Ring  of  Saturn  the Rotation of the Planets about their own Axes besides other appearances whereby the System of the World is made plain to  sense  as it was before to  reason  The  Telescope  has also improv'd the manner of  Astronomical Observations  and made them much more accurate than it was possible for them to be before And these improvements in  Astronomy  have brought along with them as ever correspondent improvements in  Geography  From the Observation of  Jupiter's Satellites  we have a ready way to determine the Longitude of places on the Earth On the other hand the  Microscope  has not been less useful in helping us to the sight of such Objects as by their minuteness escape our naked eye By it Men have pursued Nature into its most retir'd recesses so that now it can hardly any more hide its greatest Mysteries  from us How much have we learned by the help of the  Microscope  of the contrivance and structure of Animal and Vegetable Bodies and the composition of Fluids and Solids But if these  Sciences  had never gone further than by their single  Specula  and  Lentes  to give those surprizing appearances of Objects and their Images and to produce heat unimitable by our hottest Furnaces and to furnish infallible easy cheap and safe remedies for the decay of our Sight arising commonly from old Age and for purblindness they had merited the greatest esteem and invited to the closest study especially if we consider that such as naturally are almost blind and either know not their nearest acquaintance at the distance of a rooms breadth or cannot read in order to pass their time pleasantly are by Glasses adapted to the defect of their Eyes set on a level again with those that enjoy their Eyesight best and that without danger pain or charge  Again  Mathematicks  are highly serviceable to a Nation in  Military Affairs  I believe this will be readily acknowledg'd by every body The Affairs of War take in Number Space Force Distance  Time c things of  Mathematical  consideration in all its parts in  Tacticks Castrametation Fortifying Attacquing  and  Defending  The Ancients had more occasion for Mechanicks in the Art of War than we have Gunpowder readily producing a force far exceeding all the Engines they had contriv'd for Battery And this I reckon has lost us a good occasion of improving our Mechanicks the cunning of Mankind never exerting it self so much as in their Arts of destroying one another But as Gunpowder has made Mechanicks less serviceable to War it has made  Geometry  more necessary There being a force or resistance in the due measures and proportions of the Lines and Angles of a Fortification which contribute much towards its strength This Art of  Fortification  has been much study'd of late but I dare not affirm that it has attain'd its utmost perfection And tho' where the ground is regular it admits but of small variety the measures being pretty well determined by  Geometry  and Experience yet where the ground is made up of natural  Strengths  and  Weaknesses  it affords some scope for thinking and contrivance  But there is another much harder piece of  Geometry  which Gunpowder has given us occasion to improve and that is the doctrine of Projectiles whereon the Art of  Gunnery  is founded Here the  Geometers  have invented a beautiful Theory and Rules and Instruments which have reduced the casting of Bombs to great exactness As for  Tacticks  and  Castrametation Mathematicks  retain the same place in them as ever And some tolerable skill in these are necessary for  Officers  as well as for  Engineers  An  Officer  that understands Fortification will  caeteris paribus  much better defend his post as knowing wherein its strength consists or make use of his advantage to his Enemy's Ruine than he that does not He knows when he leads never so small a party what his advantages and disadvantages in Defending and Attacquing are how to make the best of his Ground c And hereby can do truely more service than another of as much Courage who for want of such knowledge it may be throws away himself and a number of brave Fellows under his Command and it's well if the mischief reaches no further As for a competent  skill in  Numbers  it is so necessary to  Officers  that no Man can be safely trusted with a Company that has it not All the business is not to fire Musquets the managing of Affairs the dealing with Agents c happen more frequently And the higher the Command is the more skill in all the aforesaid things is required And I dare appeal to all the Nations in  Europe  whether  caeteris paribus  Officers are not advanced in proportion to their skill in  Mathematical Learning  except that some times  Great Names  and  Quality  carry it but still so as that the Prince depends upon a Man of  Mathematical Learning  that is put as director to the  Quality  when that Learning is wanting in it  Lastly  Navigation  which is made up of  Astronomy  and  Geometry  is so noble an Art and to which Mankind owes so many advantages that upon this single account those Excellent Sciences deserve most of all to be study'd and merit the greatest encouragement from a Nation that owes to it both its Riches and Security And not only does the Common Art of  Navigation  depend on  Mathematicks  but whatever improvements  shall be made in the  Architectura Navalis  or Building of Ships whether they are design'd for MerchantShips or Ships of War whether swift running or bearing a great sail or lying near the wind be desired these must all be the improvements of  Geometry ShipCarpenters  indeed are very industrious but in these things they acknowledge their inability confess that their best productions are the effects of chance and implore the  Geometers  help Nor will common  Geometry  do the business it requires the most abstruse to determine the different sections of a Ship according as it is design'd for any of the foresaid ends A  French  Mathematician  P Le Hoste  has lately endeavoured some thing in this way and tho' it is not free from errors as requiring a fuller knowledge in  Geometry  yet is the Author much to be commended for this as having bravely design'd and pav'd the way for other Mathematicians and also for the former and bigger part of his Book wherein he brings to a system the working of Ships and the  Naval Tacticks  or the regular disposition of a Fleet in Attacquing Fighting and Retreating according  to the different circumstances of Wind Tides c  The great objection that is made against the necessity of  Mathematicks  in the foremention'd great Affairs of  Navigation  the Art  Military  c is that we see those Affairs are carry'd on and managed by such as are not great Mathematicians as Seamen Engineers Surveyers Gaugers Clockmakers Glassgrinders c and that the Mathematicians are commonly Speculative Retir'd Studious Men that are not for an active Life and business but content themselves to sit in their Studies and pore over a  Scheme  or a  Calculation  To which there is this plain and easy answer The Mathematicians have not only invented and order'd all the Arts abovementioned by which those grand Affairs are managed but have laid down Precepts contriv'd Instruments and Abridgements so plainly that common Artificers are capable of practising by them tho' they understand not a tittle of the grounds on which the Precepts are built And in this they have consulted the good and necessities of Mankind Those Affairs demand so great a number of people  to manage them that it is impossible to breed so many good or even tolerable Mathematicians The only thing then to be done was to make their Precepts so plain that they might be understood and practised by a multitude of Men This will best appear by examples Nothing is more ordinary than dispatch of business by common  Arithmetick  by the  Tables of simple and compound Interest Annuities  c Yet how few Men of business understand the reasons of common  Arithmetick  or the contrivance of those Tables now they are made but securely rely on them as true They were the good and the ThoroughMathematicians that made those Precepts so plain and Calculated those Tables that facilitate the practice so much Nothing is more universally necessary than the measuring of Plains and Solids And it is impossible to breed so many good Mathematicians as that there may be one that understands all the  Geometry  requisite for Surveying and measuring of  Prisms  and  Pyramids  and their parts and measuring  Frustums  of  Conoids  and  Spheroids  in every MarketTown where such work is necessary  the Mathematicians have therefore inscrib'd such Lines on their common Rulers and Slipping Rulers and adapted so plain Precepts to them that every CountryCarpenter and Gauger can do the business accurately enough tho' he knows no more of those Instruments Tables and Precepts he makes use of than a Hobbyhorse So in  Navigation  it is impossible to breed so many good Mathematicians as would be necessary to sail the hundredth part of the Ships of the Nation But the Mathematicians have laid down so plain and distinct Precepts Calculated necessary Tables and contriv'd convenient Instruments so that a Seaman that knows not the truths on which his Precepts and Tables depend may practice safely by them They  resolve  Triangules every day that know not the reason of any one of their  Operations  Seamen in their Calculations make use of  artificial Numbers  or  Logarithmes  that know nothing of their contrivance and indeed all those great inventions of the most famous Mathematicians had been almost useless for those common and great Affairs had not the practice of them been made easy to those  who cannot understand them From hence it is plain that it is to those  Speculative Retir'd Men  we owe the Rules the Instruments the Precepts for using them and the Tables which facilitate the dispatch of so many great Affairs and supply Mankind with so many conveniencies of Life They were the Men that taught the World to apply  Arithmetick Astronomy  and  Geometry  to  Sailing  without which the needle would be still useless Just the same way in the other parts of  Mathematicks  the Precepts that are practised by multitudes without being understood were contriv'd by some few great  Mathematicians  Since then it has been shewn how much  Mathematicks  improve the Mind how subservient they are to other Arts and how immediately useful to the Commonwealth there needs no other arguments or motives to a Government to encourage them This is the natural conclusion from these premises  Plato  in his  Republick    lib  VII takes care  That whoever is to be Educated for Magistracy or any considerable Post in the Commonwealth may be instructed first in Arithmetick then in Geometry and thirdly in Astronomy  And however necessary those Arts were in  Plato's  time they are much more so now The Arts of War and Trade requiring much more the assistance of those  Sciences  now than they did then as being brought to a greater height and perfection And accordingly we see these  Sciences  are the particular care of Princes that design to raise the Force and Power of their Countries It is well known that this is none of the least Arts whereby the  French King  has brought his subjects to make that Figure at Sea which they at this time do I mean the care He takes for Educating those appointed for Seaservice in  Mathematical Learning  For in the  Ordonnance Marine Title  VIII  'He orders that there be Professors to teach Navigation publickly in all the Seaport Towns who must know  designing  and teach it to their Scholars in order to lay down the appearances of Coasts c They are to keep their Schools open and read four times a week to the Seamen where they must have Charts Globes Spheres Compasses Quadrants Astrolabes and all Books and Instruments necessary to teach their Art The directors of Hospitals  are oblig'd to send thither yearly two or three of their boys to be taught and to furnish them with Books and Instruments Those Professors are oblig'd to examine the Journals deposited in the Office of Admiralty in the place of their establishment to correct the errours in presence of the Seamen and to restore them within a month c'  King  Charles  the second who well understood the importance of Establishments of this nature founded one such School in  Christ's Hospital London  which I believe is inferiour to none of the  French  but 'tis to be wished there were many more such His present  Majesty  during the time of the late War Established a  Mathematical Lecture  to breed up Engineers and Officers as knowing very well the importance thereof And this continued some time after the  Peace  And it is worthy the consideration of the  Wisdom  of the Nation whether the restoring and continuing this even in  Peace  be not expedient for the breeding of Engineers who are so useful and valuable and so difficult to be had in time of War and so little dangerous in times of  Peace  Besides the crowd of  Merchants Seamen Surveyors Engineers Shipcarpenters Artisans  c that are to be instructed in the practice of such parts of  Mathematicks  as are necessary to their own business respectively a competent number of  able Mathematicians  ought to be entertained in order to apply themselves to the practice not only to instruct the former sort but likewise to remove those obstacles which such as do not think beyond their common Rules cannot overcome And no doubt it is no small impediment to the advancement of Arts that  Speculative Men  and  good Mathematicians  are unacquainted with their particular defects and the several circumstances in them that render things  practicable  or  impracticable  But if there were publick encouragement we should have skilful Mathematicians employed in those Arts who would certainly find out and remedy the imperfections of them The present Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty knowing that there are still two great  Desiderata  in Navigation to wit  The Theory of the variation of the magnetical Needle  and a  method of finding out the Longitude of any place  that  may be practicable at Sea by Seamen and being sensible of what importance it would be to find out either of them have imployed a very fit person the ingenious M  r    Hally  who has joyn'd an entire acquaintance in the practice to a full and thorough knowledge of the more abstruse parts of  Mathematicks  And now that he is returned it is not doubted but he will satisfy those that sent him and in due time the World too with his discoveries in both those particulars and in many other that he has had occasion to make And where a long series of Observations and Experiments is necessary he has no doubt laid such a foundation as that AfterObservers may gradually perfect them If it were not for more than the correcting the situation of the Coasts where he touched and by them others whose relation to the former is known the Nation is more then triply pay'd and those who sent him have by this Mission secured to themselves more true Honour and lasting Fame than by Actions that at first view appear more Magnificent  The next thing that is necessary for the improvement of  Mathematical Learning  is That Mathematicks be more generally study'd at our  Ʋniversities  than hitherto they have been From those Seminaries the State justly expects and demands those who are acquainted both with the  Speculation  and  Practice  In those are all the encouragements to them imaginable Leisure and Assistance There are still at hand Books and Instruments as also other Scholars that have made equal progress and may be Comrades in study and the direction of the Professors There are also in perfection all the incitements to this study and especially an acquaintance with the works of the Ancients where this  Learning  is so much recommended There other Faculties are study'd to which it is subservient There also are the Nobility and Gentry bred who in due time must be called to their share in the Government of the  Fleets Army Treasury  and other Publick Employments where  Mathematical Learning  is absolutely necessary and without which they tho' of never so great Natural parts must be at the mercy and discretion of their Servants and Deputies  who will first cheat them and then laugh at them And not only Publick Employments but their Private Concerns demand Mathematical knowledge If their Fortunes lie in Woods Coal Salt Manufactures c the necessity of this knowledge is open and known and even in LandEstates no undertaking for improvement can be securely rely'd upon without it It not only makes a Man of Quality and Estate his whole Life more Illustrious and more useful for all Affairs as  Hippocrates  says  c but in particular it is the best Companion for a Country Life Were this once become a fashionable study and the  Mode  exercises its Empire over Learning as well as other things it is hard to tell how far it might influence the Morals of our Nobility and Gentry in rendring them Serious Diligent Curious taking them off from the more fruitless and airy exercises of the Fancy which they are apt to run into  The only Objection I can think of that is brought against these studies is that Mathematicks require a particular turn of Head and a happy Genius that few people are Masters of without which all the pains bestowed upon the study of them are in vain They imagine that a  Man must be Born a Mathematician  I answer that this  Exception  is common to Mathematicks and other Arts That there are persons that have a particular capacity and fitness to one more than another every body owns And from experience I dare say it is not in any higher degree true concerning Mathematicks than the others A Man of good sense and application is the person that is by nature fitted for them especially if he begins betimes And if his circumstances have been such that this did not happen by prudent direction the defect may be supply'd as much as in any Art whatsoever The only advantage this Objection has is that it is on the side of softness and idleness those powerful Allies  There is nothing further remains Sir but that I give you my thoughts in general concerning the  Order  and  Method  of studying  Mathematicks  which I shall do very shortly as knowing that you are already acquainted with the best methods and others with you may have them easily from the best and ablest hands  First then I lay down for a principle that no body at an  Ʋniversity  is to be taught the practice of any rule without the true and solid reason and demonstration of the same Rules without demonstration must and ought to be taught to  Seamen Artisans  c as I have already said and Schools for such people are fit in Seaports and TradingTowns but it is far below the dignity of an  Ʋniversity  which is design'd for solid and true Learning to do this It is from the Universities that they must come who are able to remedy the defects of the Arts and therefore nothing must be taken on trust there  Seamen  and  Surveyors  c remember their Rules because they are perpetually practising them But  Scholars  who are not thus employ'd if they know not the demonstration of them presently forget them  Secondly no part of Mathematicks ought to be taught by  Compendiums  This follows from the former  Compendiums  are fit to give a general and superficial knowledge not a thorough one It's time and not the bulk of Books we ought to be sparing of And I appeal to any person of Experience whether solid knowledge is not acquir'd in shorter time by Books treating fully of their subjects than by Compendiums and Abridgements  From hence it follows that the  Elements  of  Arithmetick  and  Geometry  are to be taught  Euclid  in his thirteen Books of Elements gives us both but our present way of Notation supersedes some of those of  Arithmetick  as demonstrating the Rules from the Operations themselves There remain then the first six Books for the  Geometry  of  Plains  and the last three for  Stereometry  The rest ought to be read in their own place for the perfection of  Arithmetick  In teaching these care ought to be taken to make use of such Examples as suit with the condition of the Scholar For instance  Merchants Accounts  and  Affairs  for Examples of the Operations of  Arithmetick  to one that is afterwards to have a concern that way whereas to a Man of the first Quality examples from  the encrease  and  decrease of the people  or from  Land or SeaForce  and from the  Tacticks  ought to be proposed For it is certain nothing makes one tyr'd sooner than the frivolous and trifling examples that are commonly brought for the exercise of the Rules of  Arithmetick  and  Geometry  tho' this is common to them with the other Arts as  Grammar Logick  c  The manner of Writing of the Mathematicians of this and the former Age makes  Trigonometry  with the manner of constructing its Tables c almost  Elementary  and the  practical Geometry  commonly so call'd is very fit to come next as an elegant application of the  Elements  of  Geometry  to Business as  Surveying Gauging  c  After the Elements of  Sphericks  which are perfectly well handled by  Theodosius  a full insight into the principles of  Astronomy  will be necessary  Mechanicks  come next to be read which are the Ground of a great part of Natural Learning and afterwards  Opticks Catoptricks  and  Dioptricks  But none of these except the Elements can be fully understood until one is pretty well skill'd in  Conicksections  And all these are made more easy by some tolerable skill in  Algebra  and its application to  Geometry  These foundations being laid any one may with great ease pursue the study of the Mathematicks as his occasions require either in its abstract parts and the more  recondite Geometry  and its application to Natural knowledge or in Mechanicks by prosecuting the  Staticks Hydrostaticks Ballisticks  c or in  Astronomy  by its application to  Geography Navigation Gnomonicks Astrolabes  c But in most of these a particular order is not necessary Any one may take that first which he is most inclined to  I shall not offer you any advice concerning the choice of Books but refer you if you want any to the direction of those who are Eminent among you  in this part of Learning I ask your pardon for the omission of  Ceremony  in these papers having followed rather the ordinary way of  Essay  than  Letter  and wishing you good success in your studies I am  Sir  Your Friend and Servant  Novemb  FINIS
