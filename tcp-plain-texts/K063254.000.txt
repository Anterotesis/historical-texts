SIR  FROM your writings I received all that inexpressible Pleasure and Improvement which Erudition ever affords the Mind of the feeling Man From your Writings I learned to form a just Character of those illustrious Worthies your mighty Predecessors in that Chair where you now sitPermit me then great Man as a Lover of Poesy and Reverer of Merit to pay you this tributary Token of Respect  J HAWKESWORTH  Omagh  Jan    PREFACE  TIRED with the Importunities of many I at length selected the following Trifles and presume to present them to the public eye  HOW far "Idle Verses essayed in early Age" may meet the public Approbation I cannot tell but he who endeavours well surely ought not to be censured  JUVENILLE Compositions sometimes meet more goodnatured Readers than rigid Critics may such be the Fate of this Volume written by an Author between his fifteenth and nineteenth Years  SUCH Sensations as are in the Bosom of a penitent Criminal certain of immediate Death but unknowing whither his immortal Soul may go such strong Sensations now beat high in me whilst with a trembling Hand I pen these Lines fearing the fatal Consequences "of flying from the safe Scenes of Privacy to meet in giddy Haste the public Eye"  BUT as some of the Productions of my boyish Fancy had appeared in the different  periodical Papers I the more readily consented to this Publication and the Poems such as they are will be here found more correct  SOME people will perhaps accuse me of that Vanity which so powerfully predominates in the youthful Mind for attempting to climb that Ascent down which so many have tumbledIn what I have written I meant well I therefore present it to the Public not with the Arrogance of an assuming young Man but with all the submissive Modesty of an Author  THE VANITY OF FRIENDSHIP A POEM WRITTEN AFTER THE MANNER OF SWIFT  THE VANITY OF FRIENDSHIP A POEM WRITTEN AFTER THE MANNER OF SWIFT INSCRIBED TO RICE HARRISON ESQ  Who not needs shall never lack a friend  But who in want a hollow friend doth try  Directly seasons him his enemy  SHAKESPEARE  "'TIS true we talk of Friendship much  "But who are they who can keep touch"  Thus sung Hibernia's patriot Dean  In Satire's energetic strain  The story we have now in view  Will prove his observations true  Seventeen hundred pounds a year  Made  Jack  to all the country dear  Of it he was no miser as  His starving predecessor was  Who left behind him what he stor'd  Of gold the god that he ador'd  But  Jack  Sir liv'd a diff'rent way  He spent his time in amours gay  He'd friends to come to him and dine  To prodigally drink his wine  To spend the tedious passing hours  In costly pleasure's roseate bow'rs  To take all from him they cou'd get  To make him pay their tavern debt  To give advice thro' private ends  In short  who had so many friends  But now alas the time was come  When  Jack  had lost his stately home  When he consum'd his whole estate  That Fame might sound him goodly great  When he had run in debt to have  Th' expensive suppers which he gave  And now the sheriffs keepers laid  On house 'till all the debts were paid  "Now let me think says  Jack  I've gentry  Who'll give me diet and my rent free  There is Samuel James and John  Generous Sidropel and Mun  Whose numerous friendly actions shew'd  Their tempers hospitably good  Whose soft benignity will grant  What my necessity may want  With them I'll screen from Law's turmoils  'Till Fortune more propitious smiles"  His case to Samuel then he told  Him Samuel cordially condol'd  But costly aid he wou'd not give  Yet seem'd from teeth to greatly grieve  When Jack saw his dissembling mode  He curs'd the gifts he ill bestow'd  And hied to James's to sojourn  But supplication meets with scorn  He rap'd at door sent in his name  The servant with this answer came  "His Honour says he does not know you  "And bid me the halldoor to show you"  Thus baffled and abus'd by two  He went to John and told his woe  But John Sir with a bow polite  Exclaim'd his house was robb'd last night  And was it not for that he wou'd  Repay the compliments he ow'd  Jack  stung with disappointment's pain  At this unmerited disdain  From those he almost rais'd from want  Cry'd "Cou'd I former deeds recant  "I'd chuse with more judicious ken  "My friends 'mid undesigning men"  Wrap'd in such thoughts which woe augment  To generous Sidropel he went  Who said his wife was broughttobed  The Doctor's fee was not yet paid  The houserent was a heavy debt  And money he cou'd no where get  Then quick to Mun he bent his way  And told the Fates' severe decree  Impell'd by Law's austere command  Whose mandate poorness can't withstand  To quit in mean Disguise's garb  Profusion's sure and just reward  A patrimonial goodly seat  His wealthy ancestor's estate  And O if happ'ly he wou'd glad  A bosom miserably sad  Ev'n with that cheering ray of hope  Which might the present anguish stop  He'd pray that to him shou'd be giv'n  Transcendent joys the gifts of Heav'n  Then Mun replies "  my dearest Jack    "You know the troubles  on my back    "You know Lord Love by passion led  "Debas'd defil'd my nuptial bed  But when the damages I recover  I'll pay thy friendship more than over"  Poor Jack when he had try'd each friend  And found none who'd assistance lend  Went home with sorrow in his heart  Which now felt Penury's galling smart  Scarce was he in when noise at door  Made him his dreadful case deplore  He thought 'twas bailiffs him to take  But oh how pleasing the mistake  'Twas letter with the glad account  He'd got a prize to the amount  Of twice five thousand sterling pound  Which he might draw from lott'ry fund  His friends  came the succeeding day  Respects and compliments to pay  And e'en to lend the wanted cash  They're sorry now they were so rash  Says Jack who with just passion burn'd  Avaunt by me ye're ever scorn'd  Ye vile dissembling hypocrites  Ye mean deceitful parasites  I cherished ye far worse than fiends  And thought ye were my dearest friends  Too late I see my sad mistake  Experience must true wisdom make  'Tis it can teach to justly scan  The temper of dissembling man  Ades sunt multa loquacem  Delassare valent Fabium  I thought so num'rous were my friends    '  Twou'd Fabius tire to tell their names  But now I plainly see alas  True Friendship neither is nor was  O HARRISON belov'd rever'd  With truth by all to all endear'd  Whose gracefully illumin'd mind  Is with benevolence refin'd  Who if an Hayley's pen was mine  Should in Fame's fairest annals shine  Who is a friend if friend there be  To Worth's imploring child or me  Whose lov'd memorial ne'er shall part  From this disinterested heart  Or wand'ring thro' the lonely wood  Or strolling by the silver flood  Or in the still attentive hour  Of thought in Erudition's bow'r  Wilt thou nor dread smooth Flatt'ry's praise  Accept the lisping Muse's lays  Applauded man my early guide  Above the pomp of tinsel pride  Above Malevolence's hate  Thou art distinguishably great  AN EPISTLE FROM LADY G TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF C  AN EPISTLE FROM LADY G TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF C  AH dear deluder cause of all my woe  Who made me break the solemn nuptial vow  Who by compulsion and enticing charms  Seduc'd me from the tend'rest husband's arms  Hear how too late my injur'd lord I mourn  How eager I'd to Virtue's paths return  Ah vainest thought my sacred honor's gone  Snar'd by Persuasion's smooth ascendant tongue  But now I grieve abandon'd and alone  My former frailties in Seclusion's gloom  How mem'ry rouses ah that gushing tear  In my rack'd brain ideas sadly dear  That rapt'rous day Imagination sees  When I sought much lov'd C to please  When I receiv'd thee in a blithe alcove  Imperial object of my guilty love  For o'er my head the graceful smiles were seen  Of genial Venus Beauty's peerless queen  With fair Adonis vot'ry to her power  In sweet embraces in the Idalian bower  And white plum'd Jove dissolv'd in soft desire  O'ercome by Laeda and the golden fire  Myself beneath in brightest scarlet roll'd  Sat mantled loosely with a veil of gold  Lost in tumultuous languishments of love  I made your heart with am'rous ardour move  Oh that I cou'd forget th' unhappy bliss  But conscience stings o'ertake who did amiss  Low thoughted Slander's quick reviling tongue  Expos'd me Virtue's progeny among  Unhappy me so vilified by Fame  That late posterity shall hate my name  What is a woman once her virtue's gone  She mourns the crime for which she can't atone  Depriv'd of balmy slumbers lenient rest  She feels recoiling torture in her breast  Cold sweats convulsions agonizing pains  Eternal throbbing through her languid veins  Tumultuous rackings sighs distractions fears  And all th' effects of never ceasing tears  She feels ineffable her pain augment  Beyond Imagination's vast extent  My pen delineates not what she endures  Death's raging pains are mild compar'd to her's  Now from society in solitude  My youthful passion's impulse is subdu'd  I'll banish C far from my thoughts  Revere my lord repent my former faults  And let my soul with seriousness be given  To the indulgent Majesty of Heaven  Misfortunes ever follow lawless loves  This our libidinous example proves  Illicit love's supreme destructive powers  Destroy'd Heavenfounded Phrygia's lofty towers  Illicit love degraded Tarquin's pride  And drove from pomp th' imperious regicide  Illicit love Antonius caus'd thy doom  And spoil'd thee of th' imperial throne of Rome  Illicit love untimely cropt the flower  The blooming  Rosamond daughter of Lord Clifford and the beautiful mistress of Henry the Second  boast of Woodstock's mazy bower  Illicit love destroy'dbut sobs and sighs  Erase my thoughts and tears bedew my eyes  LAUDES DARGELLI OR VERSES ON THE DARGLE  LAUDES DARGELLI OR VERSES ON THE DARGLE  WHAT Poet justly can recite  O Dargle pregnant with delight  The beauties of thy various bowers  Where Nature sheds her kindly powers  And gives perfections to each sense  In pomp of rustic excellence  Here rocks high tow'ring tow'rds the skies  Attract the pleas'd spectator's eyes  And here th' extending trees of Jove  Produce a cool imbowering grove  The waters whisp'ring as they flow  Amid the shelving rocks below  Join concert with the mingled song  Of the melodious feather'd throng  May courteous Powerscourt ne'er disseize  Eblana's sons of all these joys  Who gaily leave the City's care  T' imbibe the Dargle's purer air  Where thy brisk vot'ry loveliest queen  Whilst roving thro' some hillocks green  Makes known his ardent am'rous fire  To the dear object of desire  In some lone spot which charms adorn  He tells the passion sadly borne  Where each soft breeze revives th' old man  And strengthens Life's uncertain span  Within thy lofty whisp'ring woods  Where Dryads sport and Sylvan Gods  The blush that in each virgin shews  Compensates for the absent rose  Here on a bank refrigerant seat  Screen'd from the Sun's o'ercoming heat  Some stretch'd at ease the hours employ  In Bacchus's unbounded joy  And o'er each sparkling glass rejoice  To hail with loud according voice  Thee noble Owner as I stood  Thy praise resounding thro' the wood  "O Powerscourt graciously benign  Sprung from a long illustrious line  May'st thou who often bidd'st us rove  Thro' this terrene Elysian grove  Such from th' impartial dest'nies get  Whene'er thou pay'st our common debt"  SWANLINBAR A POEM  SWANLINBAR A POEM  THY lawns sweet village and thy shady hills  Thy stately fir groves whose condensing leaves  Shade sultry Summer from the blooming maid  Thy airy mountains tow'ring towards the Heaven  Adorned by Nature with rude majesty  Adown whose sloping sides the bleating lamb  And skipping goat the with'ring herbage crop  Thy prospects beautiful and picturesque  Invite the Muse the willing Muse attends  And in thy praise she strikes the warbling lyre  Health and contentment prime of earthly bliss  In thee O Village dwell and love to dwell  Health in thy potent vivifying springs  Or in thy balmy soft refreshing gales  Content in all the blessings thou bestow'st  Here wither'd beauty oft reviv'd its bloom  And age decay'd its pristine strength regain'd  You graceful form emaciated once  By the consuming burning fever's flame  By luxury and ev'ry perilous pleasure  Long courted Physic's aiding power in vain  How oft in vain prescrib'd thy deep learn'd sons  O Aesculapius in vain apply'd  Th' afflicted youth to medicinal skill  But now he walks robust and more robust  Each passing day and plainly in his visage  Sits rosy health and lo the florid cheek  Late wan and pale sad spectacle of woe  He lives restor'd by thy salubrious air  Or by thy ever efficacious spas  But languid flows the inharmonious verse  Till fir'd by Gresson's soft endearing smile  The Muse inspir'd pursues the pleasing task  And tunes to thee one tributary line  To thee fair blooming daughter of the day  Who mov'st majestic like Idalia's queen  Attended by the dimpled smiles and loves  Led by thy impulse Curiosity  To see bright Nature smiling all around  I've climb'd Binnaughlin's difficult ascent  From whence I've often seen and joy'd to see  Delightful FlorenceCourt th' enchanting seat  Of female Beauty and each softer grace  That e'er adorn'd the fair endearing sex  The seat of Virtue heavendescended Virtue  In ENNISKILLEN's gentle self she lives  Behold th' industrious cottagers around  My guide informing said and stretch'd his hand  The children once of hapless Poverty  By thy benevolence assisted all  O ENNISKILLEN affable and good  And stimulated by thy bright example  They from their dormant souls shook drowsy sloth  And while the sun illumes the golden day  In wholesome labour are they all employ'd  And in the evening bless thy gen'rous name  Unnumber'd beauties strike th' admiring eye  Binnaughlin from thy airy eminence  There Quilea rears its cloud cap'd head aloft  In gloomy majesty the sides appear  Clad with the fable horror of the heath  From thence the noble Shannon takes its source  Gently and soft at first it glides along  Soon with collected strength the waters rush  And rapid sweep the wasting banks away  Yon ofiers bending with the western blast  Direct the wond'ring eye to that gay vale  Where silver Arney in meanders flows  And where Lake Erne shews its num'rous isles  It is not easy to determine whether the number of islands be greater in summer or winter during this latter season the water rises eight or ten feet and thus many low islands are overflown and new ones formed by that element's encompassing rising grounds  Tour through Ireland in    Adorn'd with all the pomp of Sylvan pride  'Mid which appears an island small and brave  Fam'd Enniskillen in historic page  Glory commemorates thy valiant sons  Immortalized with martial panegyric  They live the lustre of thy lasting name  From mighty Quilea's bleak cerulean height  What seem huge mountains from the plains below  Now shew quite level with the vast expanse  Here even the warm poetic blood is chill'd  What colds what killing colds and to the west  In horrid sterile gloominess appear  Unpleasing sight dull Leitrim's dreary plains  Unlike thy lawns O Cavan where Ceres smiles  And at her smile comes with a copious horn  Auspicious Plenty round her golden head  A wreath of peaceful olive's intertwin'd  Ill it befits Ierne's meanest son  To soar aloft Illustrious HAYLEY's pen  He whose immortal character is fix'd  On the firm basis of establish'd fame  Alone cou'd cope with this descriptive theme  To please the ear of Beauty have I sung  Nor vainly sung if Margaret gives the sprig  Of odorous myrtle as the fair reward  "Here as the lightwing'd moments glide serene"  In sweet Seclusion's bower I woo the Muse  Salubrious village to resound thy praise  May'st thou increase and ever flourish fair  Deck'd by thy GRESSON's still improving hand  LIVING CHARACTERS OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTYSEVEN  LIVING CHARACTERS OR ONE THOUSAND

immortal guardian of the good  Unseen by human eye  From blissful realms to save my blood  With swallow wings did'st fly    Else number'd with the pallid ghosts  Of the ignobler dead  I'd wander on

first Fermanagh's lawns and plains  Have shewn what gloomy season reigns  We pass'd no happy fleeting hours  In Crum's paradisaic bow'rs  Ah blissful groves ah peaceful shades  Where late I woo'd the blueey'd maids  TO THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES THE INHABITANTS OF  SPRUNG from the meanest of the rabble  Some rise to pomp and splendor  Who think that wealth shou'd domineer  And modest worth keep under

by some of my juvenile acquaintance into a cockpit and there heard the most gentle reproof that the tender lips of parental love could utter Johannes a sage gentleman whom curiosity led to the pit  chanced to see his son Gallus at the opposite side holding wagers when the battle was terminated Johannes asked Gallus did he lose "No" replied he with the quick voice of joy "I have won a crown" "I'm sorry for it" returned Johannes" Then after shaking his head and making a long pause he continued  I hope that crown may not cost you five hundred pounds  These few words made so deep an impression on my mind that I instantly left the pit and vowed never to enter one again When I had got home reflection and sober reason made me plainly see the barbarity of that which is termed an amusement only by the unfeeling inconsiderate and mean  Those people who are termed Cockers are in general ignorant avaricious indolent fond of  inebriety and fond of accumulating money 'in an easy way' as they express themselves without once considering it is also an easy way of losing it What but a sordid desire of lucre makes a man go to such an opprobrious place Youth should beware how they enter a cockpit if they win they bet on expecting to win more if they lose Hope which is so predominant in the human mind stimulates them to bet on with the desire of recovering their own Turn your steps far from this seat of immorality and corruption where the discordant voices of the blasphemers perpetually prophane that awful name at the sound of which Virtue shudders with a religious fear  How many illustrious personages have fallen unhappy victims to their insatiable passion for cockfighting and involved their rising families  in ruin that fortune which should be theirs by hereditary right the hand of Imprudence has squandered by discharging the honourable debts at the sod  The barbarity of this epidemic pastime no less affects the heart with sensations of pity than the sight of men who stake one half of their fortunes on a blackbreasted duckwing of yellow pile affects the mind with wonder A thousand pounds lost in a few minutes such in the course of years must exhaust a man's pecuniary resources were he master even of the riches of Chili and Peru What do cockers or gamblers of any denomination depend on Chance blind chance The unpropitious termination of a single battle may perhaps hurl them headlong from the glittering pinnacles of magnificence to the vast profundity of poverty and from thence to the low gloomy  mansions of confinement where they may pass away their dark days till death transports them from the miseries of life  The pathetic Pope strongly inveighs against the cruelty practised by man to inferior creatures and the unmanly diversions of cockfighting and throwing at cocks have been reprobated by him and many of his cotemporaries I knew a gentleman who tortured every creature that his visitors might compare him to Domitian because that monster once filled the powerful chair of dominion I have seen him put two flies on a needle one at the eye the other at the point and while they in agonies would pull against each other he'd cry"Behold Domitian"  I shall conclude this paper with the story of Zai which I recollect to have heard in the happy  days of boyish innocence Zai was the only son of Amazar the wealthy who had amassed immense riches by bringing merchandize from Egypt and selling it again at considerable profit Amazar at the age of twentynine met with an irreparable loss which drove him to the height of melancholy this was the death of the beautiful Hasora to whom he had been eight years joined in all the endearing bands of wedlock The only consolation the disconsolate Amazar had was in the glooms of retirement caressing little smiling Zai the sole pledge of that pure love he had borne the amiable Hasora  Zai had now seen seven summers his lovely visage and engaging ways made him the delight of every who frequented his father's house But let us now reverse the leaf Behold the youth when the cold hand of Death consigned the tender parent to the grave possessed of those riches  which the hand of Frugality had gathered to keep him independent of mankind The promising hope of the respectedAmazar now spends his whole time in the company of Ismaen the gambler See see how quickly he empties the foaming goblet of intoxication Are those pale lips the once rosy ones of Zai which were so often wont to kiss the cooling cup of limejuice and waterYes Heaven they areBut what a metamorphosis  Zai's constitution was soon broke his money as soon spent What could he do He ran in debt to support nature and his merciless creditor thrust him in the dismal confines of a prison where he expired a victim to his inordinate desires  APPENDIX  APPENDIX  IN the north of Ireland I met with a gentleman to whose good nature I am indebted for a copy of the following Poem it is the production of the late Rev William Pilkington Curate of Omagh capital of the county of Tyrone This genius is reputed to have been a son of Dean Swift's by the celebrated Mrs Laetitia Pilkinton I am told he was the exact image of Swift and a man whose abilities were universally acknowledged his satiric talent which was very great procured him high disrespect from the brethren of the gown he was a graceful and eloquent preacher but not a very rigid observer of the doctrine he preached  The burden of a large family with the attendant anxieties and cares extremely depressed the generous spirit of this pleasing companion Thinking to drown the memory of his afflictions he frequented Bacchanalian societies and latterly drank strong liquors when alone this at length put a period to his existence he expired in a manner truly pitiable a deplorable spectacle of ungovernable passion  A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A CURATE AND A BOTTLESCREW  ridentem dicere verum  Quid vetat  HORACE  SCREW  I WONDER Sir for what intent  My master me a present sent  To one whom he assur'dly knew  Had neither call for cork or screw  Whose pittance scarce three times a year  Affords small brewings of bad beer  For which so rare you bottles ask  'Tis well it settles in the cask  The present sure betrays a jibe  To you and all your beggar tribe  My former master rest his soul  Lov'd well his bottle and his bowl  A splendid sideboard still I grac'd  My subjects in due order plac'd  Bottles and glasses still were clinking  My sphere is fellowship and drinking  When I appear'd the wretch cou'd smile  I op'd the spring cou'd cares beguile  Not Lethe's draught wou'd make a set  So soon their cares or debts forget  CURATE  If you in fact good Screw possess  Such pow'r to make affliction less  No person stands in greater need  Of all thy friendship help or aid  But why did you so long conceal  Specifics which can sorrow heal  Or yet perhaps you may contrive  Some means to keep a wretch alive  SCREW  Keep you alive No you deserve  Like all your sort to preach and starve  Favours from me Behold my hue  Am I not quite an alter'd screw  With rust defil'd all canker'd o'er  My former beauties I deplore  My outside which like mirror shone  Is now as rusty as your own  Then judge since you have us'd me so  What compliment to you I owe  CURATE  Why I must own since you were mine  You seldom dip'd your nib in wine  My scanty pittance can't afford  The sparkling glass or splendid board  Yet you from harm I'd still protect  Nor ever meant you disrespect  Nor have you met with aught abuse  But what arose from want of use  Why then this rage Let's state the case  And talk the matters face to face  Let's calmly every point discuss  Then shew me why you use me thus  SCREW  Agreed nor shall I mince the matter  Against St Paul if he drank water  And doubt not but I shall convince  At least all men of common sense  Proctors I mean who're men of merit  Ye Curates want soul sense and spirit  For 'gainst the rosy God we've reason  T' accuse your Reverences of treason  First I detest your smoaky cot  Where all things rust with damps and rot  No elegance your chambers grace  But horror reigns in ev'ry place  Your frugal table next I hate  No sideboard glasses wine or plate  But if a paltry dish you raise  Your unambitious soul's at ease  That element I next despise  Which seldom makes mens spirits rise  'Tis needless farther to explain  You know the rotgut stuff I mean  With such a cellar sideboard table  No wellbred screw to bear is able  So all I ask you as a boon  Is that you may dismiss me soon  CURATE  Alas how learn'dly you declaim  'Gainst points in which I'm not to blame  'Tis my misfortune not my fault  To meet coarse fare and taplash malt  Nor yet more culpable to dwell  In cottage worse than hermit's cell  Yet if a course of toils and cares  For more than twelve long tedious years  If strict attention night and day  Some to exhort o'er some to pray  Cou'd my poor labours recommend  I might have made my Lord a friend  And tho' no hope of help appears  In this poor vale of grief and tears  Yet in due time I know that he  Who's Lord of him will think on me  'Tis needless therefore to repine  His gracious will be always mine  SCREW  Weak man you might six years ago  Have found such conduct wou'd not do  Is this an age that worth requites  Who rise but pimps and parasites  The fawning sycophant who struts  With empty heads and pamper'd guts  The scum of learning shame to sense  Who can with all that's low dispense  Nay rascals dubb'd with Scotch degree  Will rise in preference to thee  Then act the man nor starve on hope  Sell me and buy thyself a rope  FINIS
