 THE BELLE'S STRATAGEM A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  By Mrs COWLEY  LONDON Printed for T CADELL in the  Strand    TO THE QUEEN  MADAM  IN the following Comedy my purpose was to draw a FEMALE CHARACTER which with the most lively Sensibility fine Understanding and elegant Accomplishments should unite that beautiful Reserve and Delicacy which whilst they veil those charms render them still more interesting In delineating such a Character my heart naturally dedicated it to YOUR MAJESTY and nothing remained but permission to lay it at Your feet Your Majesty's graciously allowing me this high Honour is the point to which my hopes aspired and a reward of which without censure I may be proud  MADAM  With the warmest wishes for the continuance of your Majesty's felicity

looking round as if at a loss  Saville  LINCOLN'sINNWell but where to find him now I am in Lincoln'sInnWhere did he say his Master was  Serv  He only said in Lincoln'sInn Sir  Sav  That's pretty And your wisdom never enquired at whose chambers  Serv  Sir you spoke to the servant yourself  Sav  If I was too impatient to ask questions you ought to have taken directions blockhead  Enter  Courtall  singing  Ha CourtallBid him keep the horses in motion and then enquire at all the chambers round  Exit servant  What the devil brings you to this part of the town Have any of the Long Robes handsome wives sisters or chambermaids  Court  Perhaps they havebut I came on a different errand and had thy good fortune brought thee here half  an hour sooner I'd have given thee such a treat ha ha ha  Sav  I'm sorry I miss'd it what was it  Court  I was informed a few days since that my cousins Fallow were come to town and desired earnestly to see me at their lodgings in WarwickCourt Holborn Away drove I painting them all the way as so many Hebes They came from the farthest part of Northumberland had never been in town and in course were made up of rusticity innocence and beauty  Sav  Well  Court  After waiting thirty minutes during which there was a violent bustle in bounced five sallow damsels four of them maypolesthe fifth Nature by way of variety had bent in the Aesop styleBut they all opened at once like hounds on a fresh scent  Oh cousin CourtallHow do you do cousin Courtall Lord cousin I am glad you are come We want you to go with us to the Park and the Plays and the Opera and Almack's and all the fine places  The devil thought I my dears may attend you for I am sure I won'tHowever I heroically stayed an hour with them and discovered the virgins were all come to town with the hopes of leaving itWivestheir heads full of KnightBaronights Fops and adventures  Sav  Well how did you get off  Court  Oh pleaded a million engagementsHowever conscience twitched me so I breakfasted with them this morning and afterwards 'squired them to the gardens here as the most private place in town and then took a sorrowful leave complaining of my hard hard fortune that obliged me to set off immediately for Dorsetshire ha ha ha  Sav  I congratulate your escapeCourtall at Almack's with five aukward country cousins ha ha haWhy your existence as a Man of Gallantry could never have survived it  Court  Death and fire had they come to town like the rustics of the last age to see Paul's the Lions and the Waxworkat their servicebut the cousins of our days come up Ladiesand with the knowledge they glean from magazines and pocketbooks Fine Ladies laugh at the bashfulness of their grandmothers and boldly demand their  entrées  in the first circles  Sav  Where can this fellow beCome give me some newsI have been at war with woodcocks and partridges these two months and am a stranger to all that has passed out of their region  Court  Oh enough for three Gazettes The Ladies are going to petition for a bill that during the war every man may be allowed Two Wives  Sav  'Tis impossible they should succeed for the majority of both Houses know what it is to have one  Court  Gallantry was blackball'd at the  Coterie  last Thursday and Prudence and Chastity voted in  Sav  Ay that may hold 'till the Camps break up But have ye no elopements no divorces  Court  Divorces are absolutely out and the CommonsDoctors starving so they are publishing trials of  Crim Con  with all the separate evidences at large which they find has always a wonderful effect on their trade actions tumbling in upon them afterwards like mackarel at Gravesend  Sav  What more  Court  Nothingfor weddings deaths and politics I never talk of but whilst my hair is dressing But prithee Saville how came you in town whilst all the qualified gentry are playing at popgun on Coxheath and the country overrun with hares and foxes  Sav  I came to meet my friend Doricourt who you know is lately arrived from Rome  Court  Arrived Yes faith and has cut us all out His carriage his liveries his dress himself are the  rage of the day His first appearance set the whole  Ton  in a ferment and his valet is besieged by  levées  of taylors habitmakers and other Ministers of Fashion to gratify the impatience of their customers for becoming  à la mode de Doricourt  Nay the beautiful Lady Frolic t'other night with two sister Countesses insisted upon his waistcoat for muffs and their snowy arms now bear it in triumph about town to the heartrending affliction of all our  Beaux Gorçons  Sav  Indeed Well those little gallantries will soon be over he's on the point of marriage  Court  Marriage Doricourt on the point of marriage 'Tis the happiest tidings you could have given next to his being hangedWho is the Bride elect  Sav  I never saw her but 'tis Miss Hardy the rich heiressthe match was made by the parents and the courtship begun on their nurses knees Master used to crow at Miss and Miss used to chuckle at Master  Court  Oh then by this time they care no more for each other than I do for my country cousins  Sav  I don't know that they have never met since thus high and so probably have some regard for each other  Court  Never met Odd  Sav  A whim of Mr Hardy's he thought his daughter's charms would make a more forcible impression if her lover remained in ignorance of them 'till his return from the Continent  Enter  Saville's  Servant  Serv  Mr Doricourt Sir has been at Counsellor Pleadwell's and gone about five minutes  Exit Servant  Serv  Five minutes Zounds I have been five minutes too late all my lifetimeGood morrow Courtall I must pursue him  Going  Court  Promise to dine with me today I have some honest fellows  Going off on the opposite side  Sav  Can't promise perhaps I maySee there there's a bevy of female Patagonians coming down upon us  Court  By the Lord then it must be my strapping cousinsI dare not look behind meRun man run  Exit on the same side  SCENE II  A Hall at  Doricourt  's  A gentle knock at the door  Enter the Porter  Port  Tap What sneaking devil art thou  Opens the door  Enter  Crowquill  So I suppose  you  are one of Monsieur's customers too He's above stairs now overhauling all his Honour's things to a parcel of 'em  Crowq  No Sir it is with you if you please that I want to speak  Port  Me Well what do you want with me  Crowq  Sir you must know that I amI am the Gentleman who writes the  Têteàtêtes  in the Magazines  Port  Oh ohWhat you are the fellow that ties folks together in your sixpenny cuts that never meet any where else  Crowq  Oh dear Sir excuse mewe always go on  foundation  and if you can help me to a few anecdotes of your master such as what Marchioness he lost money to in Pariswho is his favourite Lady in townor the name of the Girl he first made love to at Collegeor any incidents that happened to his Grandmother or Great auntsa couple will do by way of supportersI'll weave a web of intrigues losses and gallantries between them that shall fill four pages procure me a dozen dinners and you Sir a bottle of wine for your trouble  Port  Oh oh I heard the butler talk of you when  I lived at Lord Tinket's But what the devil do you mean by a bottle of wine You gave him a crown for a retaining fee  Crowq  Oh Sir that was for a Lord's amours a Commoner's are never but half Why I have had a Baronet's for five shillings though he was a married man and changed his mistress every six weeks  Port  Don't tell me What signifies a Baronet or a bit of a Lord who may be was never further than sun and sun round London  We  have travelled man My master has been in Italy and over the whole island of Spain talked to the Queen of France and danced with her at a masquerade Ay and such folks don't go to masquerades for nothing but mumnot a word moreUnless you'll rank my master with a Lord I'll not be guilty of blabbing his secrets I assure you  Crowq  Well Sir perhaps you'll throw in a hint or two of other families where you've lived that may be worked up into something and so Sir here is one two three four five shillings  Port  Well that's honest  pocketing the money  To tell you the truth I don't know much of my master's concerns yetbut here comes Monsieur and his gang I'll pump them they have trotted after him all round Europe from the Canaries to the Isle of Wight  Enter several foreign Servants and two Tradesmen  The Porter takes one of them aside  Tradesm  Well then you have shew'd us all  Frenchm  All  en vérité Messieurs  you  avez  seen every ting  Serviteur serviteur  Exeunt  Tradesmen  Ah here comes one  autre  curious Englishman and dat's one  autre  guinea  pour moi  Enter  Saville  Allons Monsieur  dis way I will shew you tings such tings you never see begar in Englandvelvets by Le  Mosse suits cut by Verdue trimmings by Grossette embroidery by Detanville  Sav  Puppywhere is your Master  Port  Zounds you chattering frogeating dunderhead can't you see a Gentleman'Tis Mr Saville  Frenchm  Monsieur Saville  Je suis mort de peur  Ten tousand pardons  Excusez mon erreur  and permit me you conduct to Monsieur Doricourt he be too happy  à vous voir  Exeunt  Frenchman  and  Saville  Port  Step below a bitwe'll make it out somehow I suppose a slice of sirloin won't make the story go down the worse  Exeunt  Porter  and  Crowquill  SCENE III  An Apartment at  Doricourt  's  Enter  Doricourt  Doric  speaking to a servant behind  I shall be too late for St James's bid him come immediately  Enter  Frenchman  and  Saville  Frenchm  Monsieur Saville  Exit  Frenchman  Doric  Most fortunate My dear Saville let the warmth of this embrace speak the pleasure of my heart  Sav  Well this is some comfort after the scurvy reception I met with in your hallI prepared my mind as I came up stairs for a  bon jour  a grimace and an  adieu  Doric  Why so  Sav  Judging of the master from the rest of the family What the devil is the meaning of that flock of foreigners below with their parchment faces and snuffy whiskers What can't an Englishman stand behind your carriage buckle your shoe or brush your coat  Doric  Stale my dear Saville stale Englishmen make the best Soldiers Citizens Artizans and Philosophers in the world but the very worst Footmen I keep French  fellows and Germans as the Romans kept slaves because their own countrymen had minds too enlarged and haughty to descend with a grace to the duties of such a station  Sav  A good excuse for a bad practice  Doric  On my honour experience will convince you of its truth A Frenchman neither hears sees nor breathes but as his master directs and his whole system of conduct is compris'd in one short word  Obedience  An Englishman reasons forms opinions cogitates and disputes he is the mere creature of your will the other a being conscious of equal importance in the universal scale with yourself and is therefore your judge whilst he wears your livery and decides on your actions with the freedom of a censor  Sav  And this in defence of a custom I have heard you execrate together with all the adventitious manners imported by our Travell'd Gentry  Doric  Ay but that was at eighteen we are always  very  wise at eighteen But consider this point we go into Italy where the sole business of the people is to study and improve the powers of Music we yield to the fascination and grow enthusiasts in the charming science we travel over France and see the whole kingdom composing ornaments and inventing Fashions we condescend to avail ourselves of their industry and adopt their modes we return to England and find the nation intent on the most important objects Polity Commerce War with all the Liberal Arts employ her sons the latent sparks glow afresh within our bosoms the sweet follies of the Continent imperceptibly slide away whilst Senators Statesmen Patriots and Heroes emerge from the  virtû  of Italy and the frippery of France  Sav  I may as well give it up You had always the art of placing your faults in the best light and I can't  help loving you faults and all so to start a subject which must please you When do you expect Miss Hardy  Doric  Oh the hour of expectation is past She is arrived and I this morning had the honour of an interview at Pleadwell's The writings were ready and in obedience to the will of Mr Hardy we met to sign and seal  Sav  Has the event answered Did your heart leap or sink when you beheld your Mistress  Doric  Faith neither one nor t'other shes a fine girl as far as mere flesh and blood goesBut  Sav  But what  Doric  Why she's  only  a fine girl complexion shape and features nothing more  Sav  Is not that enough  Doric  No she should have spirit fire  l'air enjoué  that something that nothing which every body feels and which no body can describe in the resistless charmers of Italy and France  Sav  Thanks to the parsimony of my father that kept me from travel I would not have lost my relish for true unaffected English beauty to have been quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Versailles and Florence  Doric  Pho thou hast no taste  English  beauty 'Tis insipidity it wants the zest it wants poignancy Frank Why I have known a Frenchwoman indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent eyes reckon in her suite as many Counts Marquisses and  Petits Maîtres  as would satisfy three dozen of our firstrate toasts I have known an Italian  Marquizina  make ten conquests in stepping from her carriage and carry her slaves from one city to another whose real intrinsic beauty would have yielded to half the little  Grisettes  that pace your Mall on a Sunday  Sav  And has Miss Hardy nothing of this  Doric  If she has she was pleased to keep it to herself I was in the room half an hour before I could catch the  colour of her eyes and every attempt to draw her into conversation occasioned so cruel an embarrassment that I was reduced to the necessity of news French fleets and Spanish captures with her father  Sav  So Miss Hardy with only beauty modesty and merit is doom'd to the arms of a husband who will despise her  Doric  You are unjust Though she has not inspir'd me with violent passion my honour secures her felicity  Sav  Come come Doricourt you know very well that when the honour of a husband is  locumtenens  for his heart his wife must be as indifferent as himself if she is not unhappy  Doric  Pho never moralise without spectacles But as we are upon the tender subject how did you bear Touchwood's carrying Lady Frances  Sav  You know I never look'd up to her with hope and Sir George is every way worthy of her  Doric  A la mode Angloise  a philosopher even in love  Sav  Come I detain youyou seem dress'd at all points and of course have an engagement  Doric  To St James's I dine at Hardy's and accompany them to the masquerade in the evening but breakfast with me tomorrow and we'll talk of our old companions for I swear to you Saville the air of the Continent has not effaced one youthful prejudice or attachment  Sav  With an exception to the case of Ladies and Servants  Doric  True there I plead guiltybut I have never yet found any man whom I could cordially take to my heart and call Friend who was not born beneath a British sky and whose heart and manners were not truly English  Ex  Doricourt  and  Saville  SCENE IV  An Apartment at Mr  Hardy  's  Villers  seated on a sopha reading  Enter  Flutter  Flut  Hah Villers have you seen Mrs Racket Miss Hardy I find is out  Vill  I have not seen her yet I have made a voyage to Lapland since I came in  flinging away the book  A Lady at her toilette is as difficult to be moved as a Quaker  yawning  What events have happened in the world since yesterday have you heard  Flut  Oh yes I stopt at Tattersall's as I came by and there I found Lord James Jessamy Sir William Wilding and Mr But now I think of it you sha'n't know a syllable of the matter for I have been informed you never believe above one half of what I say  Vill  My dear fellow somebody has imposed upon you most egregiouslyHalf Why I never believe one tenth part of what you say that is according to the plain and literal expression but as I understand you your intelligence is amusing  Flut  That's very hard now very hard I never related a falsity in my life unless I stumbled on it by mistake and if it were otherwise your dull matteroffact people are infinitely oblig'd to those warm imaginations which soar into fiction to amuse you for positively the common events of this little dirty world are not worth talking about unless you embellish 'emHah here comes Mrs Rackett Adieu to weeds I see All life  Enter Mrs  Rackett  Enter Madam in all your charms Villers has been abusing your toilette for keeping you so long but I think we are much oblig'd to it and so are you  Mrs  Rack  How so pray Goodmorning t'ye both Here here's a hand apiece for you  They kiss her hands  Flut  How so Because it has given you so many beauties  Mrs  Rack  Delightful compliment What do your think of that Villers  Vill  That he and his Compliments are alikeshewy but won't bear examiningSo you brought Miss Hardy to town last night  Mrs  Rack  Yes I should have brought her before but I had a fall from my horse that confined me a week I suppose in her heart she wished me hanged a dozen times an hour  Flut  Why  Mrs  Rack  Had she not an expecting Lover in town all the time She meets him this morning at the Lawyer's I hope she'll charm him she's the sweetest girl in the world  Vill  Vanity like murder will outYou have convinced me you think yourself more charming  Mrs  Rack  How can that be  Vill  No woman ever praises another unless she thinks herself superior in the very perfections she allows  Flut  Nor no man ever rails at the sex unless he is conscious he deserves their hatred  Mrs  Rack  Thank ye FlutterI'll owe ye a  bouquet  for that I am going to visit the newmarried Lady Frances TouchwoodWho knows her husband  Flut  Every body  Mrs  Rack  Is there not something odd in his character  Vill  Nothing but that he is passionately fond of his wifeand so petulant is his love that he open'd the cage of a favourite Bullfinch and sent it to catch Butterflies because she rewarded its song with her kisses  Mrs  Rack  Intolerable monster Such a brute deserves  Vill  Nay nay nay nay this is your sex now Give a woman but one stroke of character off she goes like a ball from a racket sees the whole man marks  him down for an angel or a devil and so exhibits him to her acquaintanceThis monster this brute is one of the worthiest fellows upon earth sound sense and a liberal mind but doats on his wife to such excess that he quarrels with every thing she admires and is jealous of her tippet and nosegay  Mrs  Rack  Oh less love for me kind Cupid I can see no difference between the torment of such an affection and hatred  Flut  Oh pardon me inconceivable difference inconceivable I see it as clearly as your bracelet In the one case the husband would say as Mr Snapper said t'other day Zounds Madam do you suppose that  my  table and  my  house and  my  pictures  Apropos des Bottes  There was the divinest Plague of Athens sold yesterday at Langford's the dead figures so natural you would have sworn they had been alive Lord Primrose bid Five hundred Six said Lady CarmineA thousand said Ingot the NabobDown went the hammerA  rouleau  for your bargain said Sir Jeremy Jingle And what answer do you think Ingot made him  Mrs  Racket  Why took the offer  Flut  Sir I would oblige you but I buy this picture to place in the nursery the children have already got Whittington and his Cat 'tis just this size and they'll make good companions  Mrs  Rack  Ha ha ha Well I protest that's just the way nowthe Nabobs and their wives outbid one at every sale and the creatures have no more taste  Vill  There again You forget this story is told by Flutter who always remembers every thing but the circumstances and the person he talks about 'twas Ingot who offer'd a  rouleau  for the bargain and Sir Jeremy Jingle who made the reply  Flut  Egad I believe you are right Well the story is as good one way as t'other you know Good morning  I am going to Mrs Crotchet's concert and in my way back shall make my bow at Sir George's  Going  Vill  I'll venture every figure in your taylor's bill you make some blunder there  Flut  turning back  Done My taylor's bill has not been paid these two years and I'll open my mouth with as much care as Mrs Bridget Button who wears cork plumpers in each cheek and never hazards more than six words for fear of shewing them  Exit  Flutter  Mrs  Rack  'Tis a goodnatur'd insignificant creature let in every where and cared for no whereThere's Miss Hardy return'd from Lincoln'sInnshe seems rather chagrin'd  Vill  Then I leave you to your communications  Enter  Letitia  followed by her Maid  Adieu I am rejoiced to see you so well Madam but I must tear myself away  Letit  Don't vanish in a moment  Vill  Oh inhuman you are two of the most dangerous women in townStaying here to be cannonaded by four such eyes is equal to a  rencontre  with Paul Jones or a midnight march to OmoaThey'll swallow the nonsense for the sake of the compliment  Aside  Exit  Villers  Letit  gives her cloak to her maid  Order Du Quesne never to come again he shall positively dress my hair no more  Exit Maid  And this odious silk how unbecoming it isI was bewitched to chuse it  Throwing herself on a sopha and looking in a pocketglass Mrs  Racket  staring at her  Did you over see such a fright as I am today  Mrs  Rack  Yes I have seen you look much worse  Letit  How can you be so provoking If I do not look this morning worse than ever I look'd in my life I am naturally a fright You shall have it which way you will  Mrs  Rack  Just as you please but pray what is the meaning of all this  Letit  rising  Men are all dissemblers flatterers deceivers Have I not heard a thousand times of my air my eyes my shape all made for victory and today when I bent my whole heart on one poor cooquest I have proved that all those imputed charms amount to nothingfor Doricourt saw them unmov'dA husband of fifteen months could not have examin'd me with more cutting indifference  Mrs  Rack  Then you return it like a wife of fifteen months and be as indifferent as he  Letit  Aye there's the sting The blooming boy who left his image in my young heart is at four and twenty improv'd in every grace that fix'd him there It is the same face that my memory and my dreams constantly painted to me but its graces are finished and every beauty heightened How mortifying to feel myself at the same moment his slave and an object of perfect indifference to him  Mrs  Rack  How are you certain that was the case Did you expect him to kneel down before the lawyer his clerks and your father to make oath of your beauty  Letit  No but he should have look'd as if a sudden ray had pierced him he should have been breathless speechless for oh Caroline all this was I  Mrs  Rack  I am sorry you was such a fool Can you expect a man who has courted and been courted by half the fine women in Europe to feel like a girl from a boardingschool He is the prettiest fellow you have seen and in course bewilders your imagination but he has seen a million of pretty women child before he saw you and his first feelings have been over long ago  Letit  Your raillery distresses me but I will touch his heart or never be his wife  Mrs Rack  Absurd and romantic If you have no reason to believe his heart preengaged be satisfied if he is a man of honour you'll have nothing to complain of  Letit  Nothing to complain of Heav'ns shall I marry the man I adore with such an expectation as that  Mrs Rack  And when you have fretted yourself pale my dear you'll have mended your expectation greatly  Letit  pausing  Yet I have one hope If there is any power whose peculiar care is faithful love that power I invoke to aid me  Enter Mr  Hardy  Hardy  Well now wasn't I right Aye Letty Aye Cousin Racket wasn't I right I knew 'twould be so He was all agog to see her before he went abroad and if he had he'd have thought no more of her face may be than his own  Mrs Rack  May be not half so much  Hardy  Aye may be sobut I see into things exactly as I foresaw today he fell desperately in love with the wench he he he  Letit  Indeed Sir how did you perceive it  Hardy  That's a pretty question How do I perceive every thing How did I foresee the fall of corn and the rise of taxes How did I know that if we quarrelled with America Norway deals would be dearer How did I foretell that a war would sink the funds How did I forewarn Parson Homily that if he didn't some way or other contrive to get more votes than Rubrick he'd lose the lectureship How did IBut what the devil makes you so dull Letitia I thought to have found you popping about as brisk as the jacks of your harpfichord  Letit  Surely Sir 'tis a very serious occasion  Hardy  Pho pho girls should never be grave before marriage How did you feel Cousin beforehand Aye  Mrs Rack  Feel why exceedingly full of cares  Hardy  Did you  Mrs Rack  I could not sleep for thinking of my coach my liveries and my chairmen the taste of clothes I should be presented in distracted me for a week and whether I should be married in white or lilac gave me the most cruel anxiety  Letit  And is it possible that you felt no other care  Hardy  And pray of what sort may your cares be Mrs Letitia I begin to foresee now that you have taken a dislike to Doricourt  Letit  Indeed Sir I have not  Hardy  Then what's all this melancholy about A'n't you going to be married and what's more to a sensible man and what's more to a young girl to a handsome man And what's all this melancholy for I say  Mrs Rack  Why because he  is  handsome and sensible and because she's over head and ears in love with him all which it seems your foreknowledge had not told you a word of  Letit  Fye Caroline  Hardy  Well come do you tell me what's the matter then If you don't like him hang the signing and sealing he sha'n't have yeand yet I can't say that neither for you know that estate that cost his father and me upwards of fourscore thousand pounds must go all to him if you won't have him if he won't have you indeed 'twill be all yours All that's clear engross'd upon parchment and the poor dear man set his hand to it whilst he was a dying"Ah" said I  I foresee you'll never live to see 'em come together but their first son  shall be christened Jeremiah after you that I promise you"  But come I say what is the matter Don't you like him  Letit  I fear Sirif I must speakI fear I was less agreeable in Mr Doricourt's eyes than he appeared in mine  Hardy  There you are mistaken for I asked him and he told me he liked you vastly Don't you think he must have taken a fancy to her  Mrs Rack  Why really I think so as I was not by  Letit  My dear Sir I am convinced he has not but if there is spirit or invention in woman he shall  Hardy  Right Girl go to your toilette  Letit  It is not my toilette that can serve me but a plan has struck me if you will not oppose it which flatters me with brilliant success  Hardy  Oppose it not I indeed What is it  Letit  Why Sirit may seem a little paradoxical but as he does not like me enough I want him to like me still less and will at our next interview endeavour to heighten his indifference into dislike  Hardy  Who the devil could have foreseen that  Mrs Rack  Heaven and earth Letitia are you serious  Letit  As serious as the most important business of my life demands  Mrs Rack  Why endeavour to make him dislike you  Letit  Because 'tis much easier to convert a sentiment into its opposite than to transform indifference into tender passion  Mrs Rack  That may be good philosophy but I am afraid you'll find it a bad maxim  Letit  I have the strongest confidence in it I am inspired with unusual spirits and on this hazard willingly  stake my chance for happiness I am impatient to begin my measures  Exit  Letitia  Hardy  Can you foresee the end of this Cousin  Mrs Rack  No Sir nothing less than your penetration can do that I am sure and I can't stay now to consider it I am going to call on the Ogles and then to Lady Frances Touchwood's and then to an Auction and thenI don't know wherebut I shall be at home time enough to witness this extraordinary interview Goodbye  Exit Mrs  Racket  Hardy  Well 'tis an odd thingI can't understand itbut I foresee Letty will have her way and so I sha'n't give myself the trouble to dispute it  Exit  Hardy  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Sir George Touchwood  's  Enter  Doricourt  and  Sir George  Doricourt  MARRIED ha ha ha you whom I heard in Paris say such things of the sex are in London a married man  Sir Geo  The sex is still what it has ever been since  la petite morale  banished substantial virtues and rather than have given my name to one of your highbred fashionable dames I'd have crossed the line in a sireship and married a Japanese  Doric  Yet you have married an English beauty yea and a beauty born in high life  Sir Geo  True but she has a simplicity of heart and manners that would have become the fair Hebrew damsels toasted by the Patriarchs  Doric  Ha ha Why thou art a downright matrimonial Quixote My life on't she becomes as mere a Town Lady in six months as though she had been bred to the trade  Sir Geo  Commoncommon  contemptuously  No Sir Lady Frances despises high life so much from the ideas I have given her that she'll live in it like a salamander in fire  Doric  Oh that the circle  dans la place Victoire  could witness thy extravagance I'll send thee off to St Evreux this night drawn at full length and coloured after nature  Sir Geo  Tell him then to add to the ridicule that Touchwood glories in the name of Husband that he has found in one Englishwoman more beauty than Frenchmen ever saw and more goodness than Frenchwomen can conceive  Doric  Wellenough of description Introduce me to this phoenix I came on purpose  Sir Geo  Introduceoh aye to be sureI believe Lady Frances is engaged just nowbut another time How handsome the dog looks today  Aside  Doric  Another timebut I have no other time 'Sdeath this is the only hour I can command this fortnight  Sir Geo  Aside  I am glad to hear it with all my soul  So then you can't dine with us today That's very unlucky  Doric  Oh yesas to dinneryes I can I believe contrive to dine with you today  Sir Geo  Psha I didn't think on what I was saying I meant supperYou can't sup with us  Doric  Why supper will be rather more convenient than dinnerBut you are fortunateif you had ask'd me any other night I could not have come  Sir Geo  TonightGad now I recollect we are particularly engaged tonightBut tomorrow night  Doric  Why look ye Sir George 'tis very plain you have no inclination to let me see your wife at all so here I sit  throws himself on a sopha  There's my hat and here are my legsNow I sha'n't stir till I have seen her and I have no engagements I'll breakfast dine and sup with you every day this week  Sir Geo  Was there ever such a provoking wretch But to be plain with you Doricourt I and my house are at your service but you are a damn'd agreeable fellow and ten years younger than I am and the women I observe always simper when you appear For these reasons I had rather when Lady Frances and I are together that you should forget we are acquainted further than a nod a smile or a howd'ye  Doric  Very well  Sir Geo  It is not merely yourself  in propriâ persanâ  that I object to but if you are intimate here you'll make my house still more the fashion than it is and it is already so much so that my doors are of no use to me I married Lady Frances to engross her to myself yet such is the blessed freedom of modern manners that in spite of me her eyes thoughts and conversation are continually divided amongst all the Flirts and Coxcombs of Fashion  Doric  To be sure I confess that kind of freedom is carried rather too far 'Tis hard one can't have a jewel in one's cabinet but the whole town must be gratified with its lustre He sha'n't preach me out of seeing his wife though  Aside  Sir Geo  Well now that's reasonable When you take time to reflect Doricourt I always observe you decide right and therefore I hope  Enter Servant  Serv  Sir my Lady desires  Sir Geo  I am particularly engaged  Doric  Oh Lord that shall be no excuse in the world  leaping from the sopha  Lead the way John I'll attend your Lady  Exit following the Servant  Sir Geo  What devil possessed me to talk about her Here Doricourt  Running after him  Doricourt  Enter  Mrs Racket  and  Miss Ogle  followed by a Servant  Mrs Rack  Acquaint your Lady that Mrs Racket and Miss Ogle are here  Exit  Servant  Miss Ogle  I shall hardly know Lady Frances 'tis so long since I was in Shropshire  Mrs Rack  And I'll be sworn you never saw her  out  of ShropshireHer father kept her locked up with his Caterpillars and Shells and loved her beyond any thing but a blue Butterfly and a petrified Frog  Miss Ogle  Ha ha haWell 'twas a cheap way of breeding heryou know he was very poor though a Lord and very highspirited though a Virtuoso In town her Pantheons Operas and Robes de Cour would have swallowed his SeaWeeds Moths and Monsters in six weeksSir George I find thinks his Wife a most extraordinary creature he has taught her to despise every thing like Fashionable Life and boasts that example will have no effect on her  Mrs Rack  There's a great degree of impertinence in all thatI'll try to make her a Fine Lady to humble him  Miss Ogle  That's just the thing I wish  Enter Lady  Frances  Lady Fran  I beg ten thousand pardons my dear Mrs RacketMiss Ogle I rejoice to see you I should have come to you sooner but I was detained in conversation by Mr Doricourt  Mrs Rack  Pray make no apology I am quite happy that we have your Ladyship in town at lastWhat stay do you make  Lady Fran  A short one Sir George talks with regret of the scenes we have left and as the ceremony of presentation is over will I believe soon return  Miss Ogle  Sure he can't be so cruel Does your Ladyship wish to return so soon  Lady Fran  I have not the habit of consulting my own wishes but I think if they decide we shall not return immediately I have yet hardly form'd an idea of London  Mrs Rack  I shall quarrel with your Lord and Master if he dares think of depriving us of you so soon How do you dispose of yourself today  Lady Fran  Sir George is going with me this morning to the mercer's to chuse a silk and then  Mrs Rack  Chuse a silk for you ha ha ha Sir George chuses your laces too I hope your gloves and your pincushions  Lady Fran  Madam  Mrs Rack  I am glad to see you blush my dear Lady Frances These are strange homespun ways If you do these things pray keep 'em secret Lord bless us If the Town should know your husband chuses your gowns  Miss Ogle  You are very young my Lady and have been brought up in solitude The maxims you learnt among the WoodNymphs in Shropshire won't pass current here I assure you  Mrs Rack  Why my dear creature you look quite frighten'dCome you shall go with us to an Exhibition  and an AuctionAfterwards we'll take a turn in the Park and then drive to Kensingtonso we shall be at home by four to dress and in the evening I'll attend you to Lady Brilliant's masquerade  Lady Fran  I shall be very happy to be of your party if Sir George has no engagements  Mrs Rack  What Do you stand so low in your own opinion that you dare not trust yourself without Sir George If you chuse to play Darby and Joan my dear you should have stay'd in the country'tis an Exhibition not calculated for London I assure you  Miss Ogle  What I suppose my Lady you and Sir George will be seen pacing it comfortably round the Canal arm and arm and then go lovingly into the same carriagedine  têteàtête  spend the evening at Picquet and so go soberly to bed at ElevenSuch a snug plan may do for an Attorney and his Wife but for Lady Frances Touchwood 'tis as unsuitable as linfeywoolfey or a black bonnet at the  Festino  Lady Fran  These are rather new doctrines to me But my dear Mrs Rackett you and Miss Ogle must judge of these things better than I can As you observe I am but young and may have caught absurd opinions Here is Sir George  Enter Sir  George  Sir Geo  Aside  'Sdeath another room full  Lady Fran  My love Mrs Racket and the Miss Ogles  Mrs Rack  Give you joy Sir GeorgeWe came to rob you of Lady Frances for a few hours  Sir Geo  A few hours  Lady Fran  Oh yes I am going to an Exhibition and an Auction and the Park and Kensington and a thousand placesIt is quite ridiculous I find for married people to be always togetherWe shall be laughed at  Sir Geo  I am astonishedMrs Racket what does the dear creature mean  Mrs Rack  Mean Sir Georgewhat she says I imagine  Miss Ogle  Why you know Sir as Lady Frances had the misfortune to be bred entirely in the Country she cannot be supposed to be versed in Fashionable Life  Sir Geo  No heaven forbid she shouldIf she had Madam she would never have been my Wife  Mrs Rack  Are you serious  Sir Geo  Perfectly soI should never have had the courage to have married a wellbred Fine Lady  Miss Ogle  Pray Sir what do you take a Fine Lady to be that you express such fear of her  sneeringly  Sir Geo  A being easily described Madam as she is seen every where but in her own house She sleeps at home but she lives all over the town In her mind every sentiment gives place to the Lust of Conquest and the vanity of being particular The feelings of Wife and Mother are lost in the whirl of dissipation If she continues virtuous 'tis by chanceand if she preserves h  r Hushand from ruin 'tis by her dexterity at the CardTableSuch a Woman I take to be a perfect Fine Lady  Mrs Rack  And you I take to be a slanderous Cynic of twoandthirtyTwenty years hence one might have forgiven such a libelNow Sir hear my definition of a Fine LadyShe is a creature for whom Nature has done much and Education more she has Taste Elegance Spirit Understanding In her manner she is free in her morals nice Her behaviour is undistinguishingly polite to her Husband and all mankindher sentiments are for their hours of retirement In a word a Fine Lady is the life of conversation the spirit of society the joy of the publicPleasure follows where ever she appears and the kindest wishes attend her slumbers  Make haste then my dear Lady Frances commence Fine Lady and force your Husband to acknowledge the justness of my picture  Lady Fran  I am sure 'tis a delightful one How can you dislike it Sir George You painted Fashionable Life in colours so disgusting that I thought I hated it but on a nearer view it seems charming I have hitherto lived in obscurity 'tis time that I should be a Woman of the World I long to beginmy heart pants with expectation and delight  Mrs Rack  Come then let us begin directly I am impatient to introduce you to that Society which you were born to ornament and charm  Lady Fran  Adieu my LoveWe shull meet again at dinner  Going  Sir Geo  Sure I am in a dreamFanny  Lady Fran  returning  Sir George  Sir Geo  Will you go without me  Mrs Rack  Will you go without meha ha ha what a pathetic address Why sure you would not always be seen side by side like two beans upon a stalk Are you afraid to trust Lady Frances with me Sir  Sir George  Heaven and earth with whom can a man trust his wife in the present state of society Formerly there were distinctions of character amongst ye every class of females had its particular description Grandmothers were pious Aunts discreet Old Maids censorious but now aunts grandmothers girls and maiden gentlewomen are all the same creaturea wrinkle more or less is the sole difference between ye  Mrs Rack  That Maiden Gentlewomen have lost their censoriousness is surely not in your catalogue of grievances  Sir Geo  Indeed it isand ranked amongst the most serious grievancesThings went well Madam when the tongues at three or four old Virgins kept all the Wives  and Daughters of a parish in awe They were the Dragons that guarded the Hesperian fruit and I wonder they have not been oblig'd by act of parliament to resume their function  Mrs Rack  Ha ha ha and pension'd I suppose for making strict enquiries into the lives and conversations of their neighbours  Sir Geo  With all my heart and impowered to oblige every woman to conform her conduct to her real situation You for instance are a Widow your air should be sedate your dress grave your deportment matronly and in all things an example to the young women growing up about youinstead of which you are dress'd for conquest think of nothing but ensnaring hearts are a Coquette a Wit and a Fine Lady  Mrs Rack  Bear witness to what he says A Coquette a Wit and a Fine Lady Who would have expected an eulogy from such an illnatur'd mortalValour to a Soldier Wisdom to a Judge or glory to a Prince is not more than such a character to a Woman  Miss Ogle  Sir George I see languishes for the charming society of a century and a half ago when a grave 'Squire and a still graver Dame surrounded by a sober family form'd a stiff groupe in a mouldy old house in the corner of a Park  Mrs Rack  Delightful serenity Undisturb'd by any noise but the cawing of rooks and the quarterly rumbling of an old familycoach on a statevisit with the happy intervention of a friendly call from the Parish Apothecary or the Curate's Wife  Sir Geo  And what is the society of which you boast a meer chaos in which all distinction of rank is lost in a ridiculous affectation of ease and every different order of beings huddled together as they were before the creation In the same  select party  you will often find the wife of a Bishop and a Sharper of an Earl and a Fidler In short 'tis one universal masquerade all disguised in the same habits and manners  Serv  Mr Flutter  Exit  Servant  Sir Geo  Here comes an illustration Now I defy you to tell from his appearance whether Flutter is a Privy Counsellor or a Mercer a Lawyer or a Grocer's 'Prentice  Enter  Flutter  Flut  Oh just which you please Sir George so you don't make me a Lord Mayor Ah Mrs Racket Lady Frances your most obedient you looknow hang me if that's not provokinghad your gown been of another colour I should have said the prettiest thing you ever heard in your life  Miss Ogle  Pray give it us  Flut  I was yesterday at Mrs Bloomer's She was dress'd all in green no other colour to be seen but that of her face and bosom So says I My dear Mrs Bloomer you look like a Carnation just bursting from its pod  Sir Geo  And what said her Husband  Flut  Her Husband Why her Husband laugh'd and said a Cucumber would have been a happier simile  Sir Geo  But there  are  Husbands Sir who would rather have corrected than amended your comparison I for instance should consider a man's complimenting my Wife as an impertinence  Flut  Why what harm can there be in compliments Sure they are not infectious and if they were you Sir George of all people breathing have reason to be satisfied about your Lady's attachment every body talks of it that little Bird there that she killed out of jealousy the most extraordinary instance of affection that ever was given  Lady Fran  I kill a Bird through jealousyHeavens Mr Flutter how can you impute such a cruelty to me  Sir Geo  I could have forgiven you if you had  Flut  Oh what a blundering FoolNo nonow I remember 'twas your Bird Lady Frances that's it  your Bullfinch which Sir George in one of the refinements of his passion sent into the wide world to seek its fortuneHe took it for a Knight in disguise  Lady Fran  Is it possible O Sir George could I have imagin'd it was you who depriv'd me of a creature I was so fond of  Sir Geo  Mr Flutter you are one of those busy idle meddling people who from mere vacuity of mind are the most dangerous inmates in a family You have neither feelings nor opinions of your own but like a glass in a tavern bear about those of every Blockhead who gives you hisand because you  mean  no harm think yourselves excus'd though broken friendships discords and murders are the consequences of your indiscretions  Flut  taking out his Tablets  Vacuity of Mind What was the next I'll write down this sermon 'tis the first I have heard since my Grandmother's funeral  Miss Ogle  Come Lady Frances you see what a cruel creature your loving Husband can be so let us leave him  Sir Geo  Madam Lady Frances shall not go  Lady Fran  Shall  not Sir GeorgeThis is the first time such an expression  weeping  Sir Geo  My love my life  Lady Fran  Don't imagine I'll be treated like a Child denied what I wish and then pacified with sweet words  Miss Ogle  apart  The Bullfinch that's an excellent subject never let it down  Lady Fran  I see plainly you would deprive me of every pleasure as well as of my sweet Birdout of pure loveBarbarous Man  Sir Geo  'Tis well Madamyour resentment of that circumstance proves to me what I did not before suspect that you are deficient both in tenderness and understandingTremble to think the hour approaches in which you would give worlds for such a proof of my love Go Madam give yourself to the Public abandon  your heart to dissipation and see if in the scenes of gaiety and folly that await you you can find a recompence for the lost affection of a doating Husband  Exit  Sir George  Flut  Lord what a fine thing it is to have the gift of Speech I suppose Sir George practises at Coachmakershall or the Blackhorse in Bondstreet  Lady Fran  He is really angry I cannot go  Mrs Rack  Not go Foolish Creature you are arrived at the moment which some time or other was sure to happen and every thing depends on the use you make of it  Miss Ogle  Come Lady Frances don't hesitate the minutes are precious  Lady Fran  I could find in my heartand yet I won't give up neitherIf I should in this instance he'll expect it for ever  Exeunt Lady  Frances  and Mrs  Racket  Miss Ogle  Now

What was the apology  Mrs Rack  That you were illbut I gave him a hint that your extreme bashfulness could not support his eye  Letit  If I comprehend him aukwardness and bashfulness are the last faults he can pardon in a woman so expect to see me transform'd into the veriest maukin  Mrs Rack  You persevere then  Letit  Certainly I know the design is a rash one and the event importantit either makes Doricourt mine by all the tenderest ties of passion or deprives me of him for ever and never to be his wife will afflict me less than to be his wife and not be belov'd  Mrs Rack  So you wo'n't trust to the good old maxim"Marry first and love will follow"  Letit  As readily as I would venture my last guinea that good fortune might follow The woman that has not touch'd the heart of a man

dev'lish sensible  Doric  Sir I give all possible credit to your assertions  Letit  Laws Papa do come along If you stand watching how can my Sweetheart break his mind and tell me how he admires me  Doric  That would be difficult indeed Madam  Hardy  I tell you Letty I'll have no more of this I see well enough  Letit  Laws don't snub me before my Husbandthat is is to beYou'll teach him to snub me tooand I believe by his looks he'd like to begin nowSo let us go Cousin you may tell the Gentleman what a genus I havehow I can cut Watchpapers and work Catgut make Quadrillebaskets with Pins and take Profiles in Shade ay as well as the Lady at N  o  South Moultonstreet Grosvenorsquare  Ex  Hardy  and  Letitia  Mrs Rack  What think you of my painting now  Doric  Oh mere watercolours Madam The Lady has caricatured your picture  Mrs Rack  And how does she strike yon on the whole  Doric  Like a good Design spoilt by the incapacity of the Artist Her faults are evidently the result of her Father's weak indulgence I observed an expression in her eye that seemed to satyrise the folly of her lips  Mrs Rack  But at her age when Education is fixed and Manner becomes Naturehopes of improvement  Doric  Would be as rational as hopes of Gold from a Jugler's CrucibleDoricourt's Wife must be incapable of improvement but it must be because she's got beyond it  Mrs Rack  I am pleased your misfortune sits no heavier  Doric  Your pardon Madam so mercurial was the hour in which I was born that misfortunes always go plump to the bottom of my heart like a pebble in water and leave the surface unruffledI shall certainly set off for Bath or the other world tonightbut whether I shall use a chaise with four swift coursers or go off in a  tangentfrom the aperture of a pistol deserves consideration so I
