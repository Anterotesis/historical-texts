 A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE BEHAVIOUR AND CONDUCT OF ARCHIBALD STEWART  Esq  LATE Lord PROVOST of  Edinburgh  In a LETTER to a Friend  Non potuit meamens quinesset gratia teneri  Sit precor officio non gravis ira pio  LONDON  Printed for M COOPER at the  Globe  in  Paternosterrow    A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE BEHAVIOUR and CONDUCT OF ARCHIBALD STEWART  Esq  LATE Lord PROVOST of  Edinburgh  SIR  YOU inform me that you had great Curiosity to be acquainted with all Provost  Stewart  's Story and the Circumstances of his Conduct in  Edinburgh  when that City was taken by the Rebels in And that having got Copies of the In formations for and against him you had been frightened from the Perusal of them by the Sight of two such long Law Papers which you imagined must be full of Citations and technical Terms and abstract Reasonings of which you are wholly ignorant But allow me to tell you your Delicacy is very ill founded I shall say nothing of the Information against him and I doubt not but as it was drawn by a Lawyer of known Capacity it is as good as the Subject would admit  of But the Information for him is really an extream good Paper and worthy of your Perusal And could you doubt of it when you know the Importance of the Cause the Expectations of the Publick and above all when you saw at the Foot the Gentleman's Name who composed it  Mr  Ferguson  of  Pitfour  You desire me to give you an Abstract of the Story in more familiar Terms and in a Form which would give you less Trouble to comprehend it I must own I would not indulge your Laziness so far at the Expence of my own were it not that I had great Obligations to Mr  Stewart  as well as a great personal Regard for him and am desirous of putting his Cause in a just Light to you who had once been so far seduced by Calumny and vulgar Reports as to have entertained some Doubts of his Innocence  Your former Prejudices are not at all surprizeing Whatever general Contempt we may entertain for popular Rumours 'tis difficult when they come full upon us not to lend at first some Attention to them and they fortify themselves with so many Stories and such numerous Circumstances that it becomes difficult at last not to give even some Credit to them But here is Mr  Stewart  's Advantage which he has now happily attained after suffering the greatest Hardships and after the most tedious Delays He is placed before a Court of Judicature His Calumniators must cease their furious Obloquy and loose Accusations and harken to the more sober Voice of his Prosecutors These have reduced their Charge to Article and Proposition which  they are engaged to prove and defend He has had an Opportunity to answer and his Answer is so good so solid so convincing that the goodnatured Mob begin to retract their Calumnies and even the furious Zealots confess with Regret that he has been so cunning and sagacious as to screen himself from all legal Proof and Punishment The utmost Confession surely you will ever expect from them  As often as I heard this Subject handled in Conversation and nothing else almost was talked of for some time I desired only every zealous Declaimer to consider the Force of the Garrison which the Provost commanded and the Strength of the Place he was to defend These are surely very obvious Considerations and yet few People ever entered into them otherwise it were impossible for such ridiculous Calumnies to have made such strong and durable Impressions Let us run over them a little in order to set the Matter in a just Light This may lead us into some general as well as particular Topics that may not be uninstructive or unentertaining  The great Difference betwixt the State of this Island at present and what it was a few Centuries ago is obvious to every one At that time the whole Defence of both Kingdoms was trusted to the People who tho' they received no Pay yet never neglected the Use of Arms tho' disperst in their own Houses yet lived under a regular military Subordination to their Superiors and Chieftains and tho' obliged to labour for their Subsistance considered all of them their civil Occupations as a Drudgery they submitted to from mere Necessity but regarded their  military Atchievements as the only Source of Honour and Glory What Actions of desperate Valour have been performed by such Troops and what welldisputed Fields they have fought is known to every one that has the least Acquaintance with the History of this or of any other Nation And the Behaviour of the present Highlander who preserves but a small Part of these ancient Institutions may set the Matter still more strongly before us  The Highlanders are altogether as ignorant of Discipline as the LowCountry Ploughmen and know as little the Nature of Encampments Marches Ranks Evolutions Firing and all the other Parts of military Exercise which preserves Order in an Army and renders it so formidable They advance to Battle in a confused Heap which some People have been pleased to call a Column They can use no Weapon but the BroadSword which gives not one Wound in ten that is mortal and obliges each Combatant to occupy double the Ground that would suffice did he employ the PushingSword or the Bayonet And they become weaker by their Victories while they disperse to their Homes in order to secure the Plunder they have acquired But still as long as they retain a devoted Obedience to their Chiestain who is their Officer and value themselves upon military Courage above all Endowments they can never justly be regarded as a contemptible Enemy  When Men have fallen into a more civilized Life and have been allowed to addict themselves entirely to the Cultivation of Arts  and Manufactures the Habit of their Mind still more than that of their Body soon renders them entirely unfit for the Use of Arms and gives a different Direction to their Ambition Every Man is then desirous to excel his Neighbour in Riches or Address and laugh at the Imputation of Cowardice or Effeminacy But the barbarous Highlander living chiefly by Pasturage has Leisure to cultivate the Ideas of military Honour and hearing of nought else but the noble Exploits of his Tribe or Clan and the renowned Heroes of his Lineage he soon fancies that he himself is born a Hero as well as a Gentleman The Songs recited at their Festivals the Fables transmitted from their Ancestors the continual Strain of their Conversation all this nourishes their martial Spirit and renders them from their Cradle compleat Soldiers in every thing but the Knowledge of Discipline  In the antient Civil Wars of  Scotland  we find that the Highland Families were always of little Weight on either Side and that the Battles were decided entirely by the  Douglasses    Carrs    Humes  and the other LowCountry Borderers who preserving the same Manners and Institutions with their Countrymen in the Mountains had acquired a superior Address and Bravery by their frequent Skirmishes and Battles with the  English  We also find that when all the Highlanders joined to all the Lowlanders much more numerous and brave than they invaded  England  under the legal Authority of their Prince or Sovereign that Nation were so far from being alarmed at the Storm that it scarce sufficed to rouse them from their  Indolence and Repose The Militia of the Northern Counties was commonly strong enough to repel the Invaders and the Inhabitants of  London  when Battles were fought in  Northumberland  or the Bishoprick of  Durham  for our Ancestors seldom advanced farther heard of these Combats with as great Security as now they read of the Wars betwixt the  Persians  and the  Indians  'Twas only when an ambitious Prince like  Edward  the First or Third undertook the Conquest of  Scotland  that the whole Force of  England  was mustered up against us  But now how can we think of it without Shame and Indignation when not above a fifth Part of these miserable Highlanders who are no braver than their Ancestors rose in Rebellion they trampled down the whole LowCountries who were generally averse to their Cause and whose Ancestors could have dissipated twenty times the Force of such Barbarians They advanced into the middle of  England  without meeting any Resistance They threw a prodigious Alarm into the Capital itself the greatest City in the Universe they shook and rent the whole Fabrick of the Government and the whole System of Credit on which it was built And tho' there were three regular Armies in  England  each of them much more numerous than they they retreated back into their own Country and still maintained their Ground Nor can any reasonable Man doubt that if these Armies had been removed eight Millions of People must have been subdued and reduced to Slavery by five Thousand the bravest but still the most worthless amongst them  I shall never forget the Conversation on these Events I had at that time with a  Swiss  Gentleman that could not sufficiently admire how so great a People who really are Lords of the Ocean and who boast of holding in their Hand the Ballance of Power in  Europe  could be so impotent and defenceless against so mean a Foe  Let those Highlanders  says he  have invaded my Country and the Militia of three  Swiss  Parishes would have repelled what the whole Force of your three Kingdoms is scarce able to master  And if we allow only a Battalion to a Parish which seems reasonable in so populous a Country and where every Man is disciplined we shall find that this Boast contains no Exaggeration but a serious and to us a very melancholy Truth  Since then the Disposition and Discipline of this Age and Nation is such what reasonable Man could be surprized to hear that the Rebels had become Masters of  Edinburgh  while it was not defended but deserted by its timid Inhabitants Methinks we should at first have expected that Event as firmly as that they would enter  Kelso    Penrith  or any defenceless open Village that lay upon their Road I might add  London  to the Number and suppose only that the Rebels had advanced from  Derby  and that Lord  Stair  instead of encamping on  Finchly  Common had led his Army down to  Exeter  or  Plymouth  Would my Lord Mayor who commands near a Million  Comprehending the City of  Westminister  and Borough of  Southwark  which are indeed more properly his Allies than Subjects  of People have ventured to give them the smallest Opposition or like a  Drawcansir  have stood alone in their way armed with  his Mace and great Cap of Maintenance For I take it for granted that every Mortal Citizen and Courtier Laity and Clergy Man and Woman old and young would have deserted him  I wish his Majesty would be pleased to honour me with the Command of either of the  Highland  Battalions and that I had some honest  Jesuitical  Clergyman to lay my Scruples I should think it a very easy Exploit to march them from  Dover  to  Inverness  rob the Bank of  England  in my Way and carry my Spoils without Interruption thro' the whole Nation provided the Army were disposed to continue mere Spectators of my Prowess  To tell the Truth one of the Persons whom I should be the most sorry to meet with on my Road would be Mr  Stewart  For by all that I can learn of his Conduct he acted the Part of so vigilant active and even brave a Migistrate so far as he was tried that he might create me some Trouble But still if his Force was no greater than what it was during the last Rebellion he would not be able to give me any great Interruption  Let us ennumerate that Force in order to judge the better of it and determine whether it was likely to resist the Rebels We shall surely find a List of Heroes equal to those of which  Homer  has given us a Catalogue if not in his  Illiad  at least in his  Batrachomyomachia  or Battle of the Frogs and Mice  There were of the Town Guards ninety six Men augmented at that Time to These are rather elderly Men but pretty well disciplined and indeed the only real Force the Provost was Master of The rest were in a  Word undisciplined  Britons  which implies just as formidable an Idea as undisciplined  Romans  or undisciplined  Indians  They were nominally divided into the TrainedBands the  Edinburgh  Regiment and the Volunteers But this Division was really what the Schoolmen call a Distinction without a Difference For with Regard to military Prowess they were much the same  As to the TrainedBands  These TrainedBands are commonly about Men  in what Condition that formidable Body may be in at present or might have been in at the time of the Rebellion I cannot tell but I remember when I was a Boy I had a very contemptible Idea of their Courage For as they were usually drawn out on Birth Days and marched up through the main Street it was very common for any of them that was bolder than usual and would give himself Airs before his Wife or Mistress to fire his Piece in the Street without any Authority or Command from his Officers But I always observed that they shut their Eyes before they ventured on this military Exploit and I who had at that time been accustomed to fire at Rooks and Magpyes was very much diverted with their Timorousness  'Tis true their Fear was better grounded than I believe they themselves imagined for their Arms are commonly so bad that a very moderate Charge of Powder would have made them burst about their Ears These were the Arms which the Provost so feloniously allowed to fall into the Hands of the Rebels  However I question not but there are many very honest substantial Tradesmen amongst them and as long as that is granted I suppose they will allow any one to make as merry as he pleases with their military Character  His Majesty's Warrant to raise the  Edinburgh  Regiment was not delivered to the Provost till the th of  September  seven Days before the Rebels entered the Town The oldest enlisted therefore were now Veteran Troops of seven Days standing the youngest not less than a Quarter of an Hour Their Number might amount to about I am told that their Appearance resembled very much that of  Falstaff  's Tatterdemallion Company which his Friend supposed he had leviod by unloading the Gibbets and pressing the dead Bodies But the merry Knight defended his Company by saying  Tut mortal Men mortal Men good enough to toss Food for Powder  Tho' it is my humble Opinion that had the Mortality of the Regiment abovementioned depended on their being Food for Powder they would have deserved the Epithet of the  immortal Body  as much as the King of  Persia  's Guards who as  Herodotus  tells us were dignified with that Appellation But not to be too hard upo  our Countrymen I shall allow that notwithstanding their Poverty they would have behaved as well as the Million Regiment of  London  so called from the Property of the Soldiers which it seems amounted to that Sum  The Volunteers who come next to the Number of and close the Rear the Post of Honour in all Retreats will perhaps expect to be treated with greater Gravity and Respect And no doubt they deserve it were it only for their well meant Endeavours in Defence of their King and Country As to their Discipline and Experience it was much the same with that of the others I need not add  their Courage For these are Points almost inseparable Religious Zeal makes a mighty Addition to Discipline but is of no Moment when alone  Cromwell  's Enthusiasts conquered all the Nobility and Gentry of  England  and at the Battle of  Dunkirk  struck the  French  and  Spaniards  with Admiration even under a  Turenne  and a  Condé  But their Brethren at  BothwellBridge  fled before they came within Sight of the Enemy Which of these Examples our Volunteers were most likely to imitate I leave to their own Conscience to determine A Friend of mine who has a poetical Genius has made a Description of their March from the  LawnMarket  to the  WestPort  when they went out to meet the Rebels and has invented a very magnificent Simile to illustrate it He compares it to the Course of the  Rhine  which rolling pompously it Waves through fertile Fields instead of augmenting in its Course is continually drawn off by a thousand Canals and at last becomes a small Rivulet which loses itself in the Sand before it reaches the Ocean  Such were the Forces over whom the Provost had some Authority His Auxiliaries were two Regiments of Dragoons under Mr  F  then a Brigadier General now happily a Major General in his Majesty's Service Of what Importance these were to the Defence of the Town shall be considered afterwards  I remember  Cardinal de Retz  says that a great Prince made very merry with the new levied Troops of  Paris  during the Civil Wars and when he mentioned the Defence that  might be expected from the City against the King's Troops usually called it  La guerre des pots de chambre  The War of the Chamberpots As it is well known that a Chamberpot is a very formidable Machine in  Edinburgh  I wonder it has not been comprized amongst Provost  Stewart  's Forces at least amongst his Auxiliaries in Conjunction with the rest abovementioned  Having thus given a faithful Account of the Garrison let us now bestow some Considerations on the Place the Defence of which was expected from Mr  Stewart  and which he is supposed to have lost by Negligence or bad Intentions A weak or no Garrison in a Place weakly fortified or not fortified at all must be the Consummation of all Weakness We are forbid by Philosophy to seek for more Causes then are requisite to explain any Phaenomenon And I think it will fairly be allowed that if these two Circumstances are admitted 'twill be quite superfluous to have recourse to a third  viz  a weak or a treacherous Governor in order to account for the Surrender of the Place  You know that the City of  Edinburgh  is surrounded for the greatest part by a plain Wall about twenty Foot high where highest and about two and a half or three Foot thick where thickest It is not in many Places flanked by any Bastions It has not Strength or Thickness enough to bear Cannon The Besieged would not even have room to handle or charge their Pieces but must be set up aloft as Marks to the Enemy who can annoy them infinitely more and receive less Harm from them than if both stood in an open Field  You know that this Wall tho' near two Miles in Length surrounds not the whole Town but is supplied on the North by a Lake which is fordable in many Places  You know that this Wall for a very considerable Space is overlooked by Houses which stand within five or six Paces of it and which it was impossible to destroy because of their Number and Value  The Town is supplied with Water entirely by Pipes Its Bread is even strictly speaking its daily Bread For the Bakers never have by them more Flower than serves them a Day but bring it continually from their Milns on the Water of  Leith  as Occasion requires  Besides as happens in all Civil Wars there were so many disaffected Persons in Town that had it been held out but for three Hours which indeed was impossible it was justly feared that it would have been set on fire from within in order to facilitate the Entry of the Rebels nay it was easily possible for the Rebels themselves to set fire to it from without and force it by that means to a speedy Surrender  It is obvious to every one however ignorant of military Affairs that any Governor who incloses himself in such a Place fights with Disadvantage and has infinitely better Chance for Success if he fairly opens his Gates and marches forth to combat his Enemy in an equal Battle For not to insist on the other Disadvantages above mentioned the Circuit of these Walls is too large to be guarded by any moderate Garrison the Enemy can draw them together to any one Place by a false Alarm in the Night or even in the Day while he breaks in  at a distant Place that is weakly defended and the Garrison entangled among the Houses and GardenWalls must be cut in Pieces almost without Resistance  This Measure therefore of meeting the Rebels before they reached  Edinburgh  was very prudently resolved on by General  Guest  on the sixteenth of  September  when Intelligence was brought that the Highlanders were approaching and he ordered Brigadier  F  to advance with his Dragoons to the  ColtBridge  for that Purpose he also desired Mr  Stewart  to join what Infantry he could to sustain the Dragoons The Provost ordered upon this Duty all the Town Guards and all the  Edinburgh  Regiment that were fit for Service He had no Power to order the Volunteers out of Town He only consented that as many as pleased should be allowed to march out But it seems they had as little Inclination to go as he had Power to order them a few of them made a faint Effort but 'tis said met with Opposition from some of the  zealously affected  who represented to them the infinite Value of their Lives in comparison of those Ruffians the Highlanders This Opposition they were never able to overcome  Brigadier  F  whose Conduct in this whole Affair is too remarkable to be forgot  Non ego te meis  Chartis inornatum sileri  Totve tuos patiar labores  Impune Lolli carpere lividas  Obliviones Est animus tibi  Rerumque prudens c c  HORACE  tho'  he had only two Regiments of Dragoons and a very few Infantry was still a formidable Enemy to the Rebels For as much as regular veteran Infantry are superior to Cavalry as much are Cavalry especially in an open Field superior to an irregular Infantry such as the Highlanders who cannot keep their Ranks wherein consists all the Force of Foot who cannot fire regularly in Platoons who know not the Use of the Bayonet and whose sole Weapon is their BroadSword in which a Horseman by his very Situation has an infinite Advantage above them Or if it were too sanguine to hope for a Victory from such a Force as the Brigadier commanded a leisurely and a regular Retreat might at least have been made tho' he had advanced within a Musketshot of the Enemy  But before the Rebels came within Sight of the King's Forces before they came within three Miles distance of them Orders were issued to the Dragoons to wheel which they immediately did with the greatest Order and Regularity imaginable As 'tis known nothing is more beautiful than the Evolutions and Motions of Cavalry the Spectators stood in Expectation what fine warlike  Manaeuvre  this might terminate in when new Orders were immediately issued to retreat They immediately retreated and began to march in the usual Pace of Cavalry Orders were repeated every Furlong to quicken their Pace and both Precept and Example concurring they quickened it so well that before they reached  Edinburgh  they had come to a pretty smart Gallop They passed in an inexpressible Hurry and Confusion through the narrow Lanes at  Barefoot  's Parks in the Sight  of all the North Part of the Town to the infinite Joy of the Disaffected and equal Grief and Consternation of all the other Inhabitants They rushed like a Torrent down to  Leith  where they endeavoured to draw Breath But some unlucky Boy I suppose a  Jacobite  in his Heart calling to them that the Highlanders were approaching they immediately took to their Heels again and galloped to  Prestonpans  about six Miles further Here in a literal Sense  Timor addidit alas  their Fear added Wings I mean to the Rebels For otherwise they could not possibly imagine that these formidable Enemies could be within several Miles of them But at  Prestonpans  the same Alarm was renewed  The Philistines be upon thee Sampson  they galloped to  Northberwick  and being now about twenty Miles on the other Side of  Edinburgh  they thought they might safely dismount from their Horses and look out for Victuals Accordingly like the antient  Grecian  Heroes each of them began to kill and dress his Provisions  Egit amor dapis atque pugnae  they were actuated by the Desire of Supper and a Battle The Sheep and Turkies of  Northberwick  paid for this warlike Disposition But behold the Uncertainty of human Happiness when the Mutton was just ready to be put upon Table they heard or thought they heard the same Cry of the Highlanders Their Fear proved stronger than their Hunger they again got on Horseback but were informed time enough of the Falseness of the Alarm to prevent the spoiling of their Meal  By such Rudiments as these the Dragoons  were trained till at last they became so perfect in their Lesson that at the Battle of  Preston  they could practise it of themselves tho' even there the same good Example was not wanting  I have seen an  Italian  Opera called  Caesare in Egitto  or  Caesar  in  Egypt  where in the first Scene  Caesar  is introduced in a great Hurry giving Orders to his Soldiers  Fugge fugge a'llo scampo  Fly fly to your Heels This is a Proof that the Commander at the  ColtBridge  is not the first Hero that gave such Orders to his Troops  'Twas in Consideration of such great Example I suppose that he has been so honourably acquitted  Upon his Trial he justified himself at Mr  Stewart  's Expence and threw much Blame upon the Provost  and since promoted while Mr  Stewart  has been imprisoned for fourteen Months forced to give a Recognizance of  l  for his Appearance and three times in a manner brought upon his Trial So true the old Proverb  That it is safer for one Man to steal a Horse than for another to look over a Hedge  But Mr  Stewart  asserts very justly that he neither stole the Horse nor looked over the Hedge He neither incurred any real Guilt nor gave the smallest Foundation for any such Suspicion the only adviseable Expedient for saving the Town was tried and failing with such multiplied Circumstances of Terror and Consternation it left him if possible in a worse Situation than before by that Discouragement with which it imprest every one The Volunteers before that time had thought fit of themselves to give up their  Arms to the Castle the  Edinburgh  Regiment had also given up their Arms The Burghers or TrainedBands deserted by the regular Forces refused to expose their Lives when they understood by repeated Threatnings from the Rebels that every Man who made any Resistance should be put to Death In short an universal Panic and that not groundless had seized the People 'Tis what the bravest and best disciplined Forces have been subject to and what is with great Difficulty cured by the most expert Commanders But 'tis unavoidable in every undisciplined Multitude and is there perfectly incurable  What tho' some faint Glimpse of Hope was afforded by the Intelligence received towards the Evening of this fatal Day that Sir  J  C  with his Army had been seen at Sea off  Dunbar  This Succour was too distant to relieve them from an Enemy who was at their Gates And the Minds of Men were now unbent and had with great Reason abandoned all Thoughts of Defence which they could not resume again in such immediate Danger and without any probable or possible View of Success  In this Confusion when nobody did his Duty when nobody but Mr  Stewart  seemed to think he had now any Duty to do the Town always ungarrisoned always unfortified now in an universal Consternation perhaps divided within itself was entered without Resistance by the Rebels  I should think it an Affront on your Understanding to shew you more particularly how unavoidable this Event is to be esteemed and therefore having put this main Point in  a just Light I shall touch tho' briefly on the other Articles of Accusation They are I own like the Provost's Forces pretty numerous but surely the most disorderly undisciplined Rabble that ever were led into the Field They are rather the Subject of Ridicule than of any serious Opposition For Instance  The Lord Justice Clerk several of the Judges along with the King's Council gave it unanimously as their Opinion that the levying of a Regiment without his Majesty's Warrant was illegal His Majesty when applied to confirmed that Doubt by granting that Warrant And the plain Words of the Statute requires such an Authority yet the raising a Doubt upon this Head is deemed a Crime tho' that Doubt or any other Doubt were it ever so ill grounded must be allowed intirely innocent  Article the st    The Provost also is said to have raised a Doubt about the Legality of inlisting the Volunteers And indeed this Case is so much alike or so much the same with the other of raising a Regiment that no wonder such a Scruple did arise But he took Care immediately to consult the Lord Advocate and he also took Care immediately to acquiesce in his Lordship's Judgment Yet this is one Article of Charge against him  Article the d    The TownCouncil intrusted the Inspection and Care of the Work to a Committee under another Person The Works projected were all finished before the Arrival of the Rebels Are you not surprized he must answer for them as if they were unfinished or as  if they had chiefly been put under his Direction  Article the d    Some Zealots had proposed to set up Marks of Distinction from mere Suspicion on several Citizens who behaved themselves peaceably The Provost rejected so imprudent so pernicious a Measure Is he therefore criminal  Article the th  He offered Pay and Victuals to some Volunteers that came from the Country need I repeat the Question if this Proposal renders him criminal  Article the th    A Gentleman Mr  Alves  travelling on the Road towards  Edinburgh  passes the Rebels and the Duke of  Perth  gives him a threatning Message to deliver to the Provost The Provost does not immediately commit him both because it did not appear that he was any way guilty in relating to the Chief Magistrate a Story in which he had been involuntarily engaged and because there was Danger of spreading the Story the faster and intimidating the Inhabitants by such a Commitment Hearing a few Hours afterwards that the Gentleman had been so imprudent as to tell his Message to others he immediately committed him You are not surprized I suppose after what you have read above to find that this is an Article of Accusation  Article the th    He is also charged with receiving a Petition from the Inhabitants keeping a Meeting with them and hearing a Letter read from the Pretender's Son The receiving the Petition was innocent and also unavoidable unless he had shut himself up in his Closet The calling a Meeting of the Inhabitants at such a Juncture would also  have been innocent But he called no such Meeting The Inhabitants under Terror of the approaching Danger pressed in upon him wherever he went and would have their Complaints and Remonstrances heard and the Provost so far from consenting to read the Letter openly and strongly opposed it and left the Company to avoid hearing it  Article the th  All these Facts are public and notorious  On the th of  September  the Provost was called in the Evening to Lord Justice Clerk's where Lord Advocate General  Guest  Brigadier  F  and several other Officers were present A Proposal was there made that the Dragoons should be brought into Town with a View to give them some Rest and Refreshment and have their Horses fed in the Streets But upon Reflection it appeared that the Avenues of the Town might be taken possession of by the Rebels and the Streets barricadoed the Houses lined and the Dragoons by that means fall into the Hands of the Enemy This Proposal therefore was most justly rejected Next Day after the near Approach of the Rebels after the Flight of the Dragoons after the universal Consternation of all Ranks Mr  Stewart  refused to sign any Order to these Dragoons over whom he had no Authority to return and enter into the Town tho' he promised them all Kind of good Reception and Entertainment if they thought proper to come When I find the Refusal to sign such an Order stated as an Article of Accusation against the Provost I cannot think but the Accuser foreseeing the  Circumstances of Merit which the Accused would plead laid immediate Claim to them as his own Right like a prudent General who takes Possession of those Eminences or strong Grounds that may be of Service to the Enemy This Observation is indeed applicable to almost all the Articles there is scarce any of them but might be cited as a Proof of Mr  Stewart  's Vigilance Prudence Activity or Moderation  If the Volunteers in the Hurry of so active a Day as the th of  September  waited some time for Orders without receiving any this is also made an Article of Charge  Article the th    The th Article is of the same Force with all the rest tho' I shall not tire either you or myself by narrating or refuting it I shall only add a few Words with regard to the  Eleventh  Article which charges him with allowing the City Arms to fall into the Hands of the Rebels because some People think there is a Foundation for this Charge tho' they frankly allow all the rest to be frivolous and even ridiculous  First  Without mentioning the Insignificancy of these Arms Mr  Stewart  pleads with regard to this Article and with regard to all Articles that have been or may ever be charged against him that tho' Chief Magistrate and President of the TownCouncil he was really but one Member and had but one Vote The supreme Command was in the Council They were criminal if there be any Crime It is not nor can it be pretended that he in this or any other Instance opposed or overruled or contradicted their Determination  Secondly  There had several Messages come from the Rebels threatning Destruction if the City either resisted or secreted their Arms It is a Question whether the Magistrates for the saving of a few rusty Arms ought in Prudence to have run the Risque of having these Threats executed considering the known Barbarity of the Clans and the then unknown Moderation of their Chieftains But it is no Question however the Magistrates had determined that the People would not have consented and consequently that the secreting these Arms was absolutely impracticable  Thirdly  Mr  Stewart  showed all along a particular Attention to keep Arms out of the Hands of the Rebels When it was proposed after the News arrived of Sir  J  C  's being seen off  Dunbar  to desire back again from the Castle the Arms which the Volunteers and the  Edinburgh  Regiment had carried thither the Provost apprehensive of the Consequences rejected the Proposal till he should see as he said a better Disposition in the Inhabitants to make use of Arms And he even sent a Message to General  Guest  in the Castle informing him of the Consternation of the Town and the little Authority which the Magistrates had to force the TrainedBands to deliver up their Arms and desiring at the same time the General to send down a Party to carry up the Arms or use some other Expedient to that Purpose  Fourthly  It is proper to consider in this Case the Uncertainty of the Situation to which the Magistrates and Council were reduced during the last and most distressing Scene of this unlucky  Affair Sometimes terrified with the immediate Approach of the Rebels at other times incouraged with some Prospect of Relief even towards the End of this Period there were some Hopes of the Return of the Dragoons Nor was that Expectation quite over in the Meeting of the Council until they heard the Rebels had entered the Town Had the Dragoons returned to the City and animated the People in its Defence the Charge against the Provost then would have been inverted Why did he send up the Arms to the Castle Why did he carry them out of the way when they might be instantly wanted for the Defence of the Town and the near Approach of the Rebels made a Moment's Delay of great Consequence And the Citation might have been adduced which has been misapplied in the present Case  Quod puncto saepe temporis maximarum rerum occasiones amittuntur  That Success in the greatest Affairs frequently depends on a Moment  But  Fifthly  what if Mr  Stewart  should say which indeed he has here no manner of Occasion for that he was in the wrong and that in the general Hurry and Consternation it was difficult not to forget something Would any Man lay this as a criminal Accusation against him I grant in War it is never allowed a General to say  Non cogitavi  I did not think of it  Marlborough  or  Eugene  might be ashamed of such an Excuse But the Provost was bred to a different Profession And I dare affirm that even these great Generals had they been ingenuous might twenty times in their Lives have made use of this Apology  The  Twelfth  and last Article is if possible still  more extraordinary than all the rest It makes the Provost the  Scape  Goat and charges him with the Sins of the whole People because the People want Charity and judge him criminal therefore he must really be so You may read indeed in your  Machiavel  that by a very peculiar and very absurd Law in the Republick of  Florence  whereever the popular Opinion condemned a Man it was lawful for a certain Magistrate called the  Gonfalioneré  immediately to put him to death without any Trial or Form of Process I have no Intention to deny that Mr  Stewart  would have fared very ill had he been in  Florence  two Years ago and had the present Provost been  Gonfalioneré  Tho' now I believe he would have no Reluctance to submit himself to a popular Tribunal  The People's Voice is odd  It is and it is not the Voice of God  But tho' popular Clamours are not here as in  Florence  authorized by Law it is plain that in Practice at least in Mr  Stewart  's Case they draw very terrible Consequences after them He was sensible of the Disadvantage he lay under yet this would not discourage him from attending his Duty in Parliament He put himself into the Hands of his Enemies for such the Ministry had become nor need we be in the least surprized at it He suffered a severe Confinement for some time and tho' this was by Degrees remitted yet still it continued a Confinement for fourteen Months very grievous to any Man and very prejudicial to a Man of Business  I have been certainly informed that very often  when the Ministry in prosecution of their usual Lenity was resolved to give Mr  Stewart  his Liberty their Hands were continually stopped by a fresh Cargo of Lies and Calumnies imported to them from  Scotland  and which it required some time to examine and discuss  But when at last he got his Liberty and had the Prospect of a fair Trial this happy Time which should put a Period to all his Sufferings was continually protracted in the most unaccountable Manner in the World At the first Diet in  March  he was put off till  June  and afterwards till  August  When every Thing was then ready for a Trial the Prosecutor deserted the Diet and Mr  Stewart  as well as the Public imagined that all was over and that his Enemies conscious of his Innocence were to free him from all farther Prosecution But he is again it seems to be brought on his Taial with additional Expence and Vexation and Trouble How long this may yet last is uncertain and 'tis evident any Man might me ruined by the Continuation and Repetition of such a Practice For which it seems our Law provides no Remedy  All these vexatious Measures gave the more Indignation when we consider again it whom and by whom they are exercised You are perfectly well acquainted with Mr  Stewart  and know him to be a good Magistrate a good Friend a good Companion a fair Dealer A Man in every Action of his Life full of Humanity Justice and Moderation  The Government too is surely the fullest of Mildness Equity and Justice in the World The present Instance is I believe the only one in near sixty Years of an innocent Man  that has ever lain under the least Oppression If our Government is faulty in any Thing 'tis rather in the opposite Extreme and the present Times show sufficient Examples of it  The Town of  Edinburgh  was lost  a most unexpected and most unaccountable Event surely But what was it when the Battle of  Falkirk  was lost when a numerous a veteran and a brave Army fled before a Handful of Highlanders whom they had scarce seen I never heard that the Author of that Calamity has been punished or even questioned or has met with the smallest Discouragement I mean from the higher Powers For I was very well diverted t'other Day by the Account of a Sarcasm he met with from a private Hand which was the severest in the World  When the Army fled to  Linlithgow  they immediately quartered themselves about in all the Houses and even in the Palace where there dwelt at that Time a Lady noted for Wit and Beauty who observing their disorderly Proceedings was apprehensive they would fire the Palace She immediately went to remonstrate to a certain great General and was received  pro solitâ suâ humanitate  with his usual Humanity Finding her Remonstrances vain she took her Leave in these Words  To take care  says she  of the King's House is your Concern For my Part I can run from Fire as fast as any of you  So spoke the Cherub and her grave Rebuke  Severe in youthful Beauty added Grace  Invincible Abash'd the Devil stood  c c  It would be cruel to mention the unfortunate K  t and I believe since we live in an acquitting  Age every Body is glad he was acquitted I have heard that all the Winter after the Battle of  Preston  he was carried about  London  in his Chair with the Curtains drawn to escape the Derision of the Mob till the News of the Battle of  Falkirk  arrived and then he pulled back the Curtains and showed his Face and his r  R  to all the World Thus the Reputation which the Hero of the  ColtBridge  was the chief Cause of depriving him of the Hero of  Falkirk  in a great Measure restored to him  Saepe premente Deo fert Deus alter open  I need not insist on the Mayor of  Carlisle  Mr  Pattison  not  Paterson  who defended so gloriously a fortified Town against the Rebels  I shall only say If all these Enormities pass unpunished and Mr  Stewart  alone the Victim there are some People to make Use of the Allusion of a witty Author that resemble very much the Monster in  Rabelais  that could swallow a Windmill every Morning to Breakfast and was at last choaked with a Pound of FreshButter hot from an Oven  I am  c  POSTSCRIPT  I Intended to have sent this by  but not being able to meet him before he left this Country I was obliged to keep it by me till this time when I hear to my great Satisfaction that Mr  Stewart  has been acquitted by the Jury  Nemine contradicente  and that all the Facts contained in his Information and in the foregoing Letter were proved with an Evidence and Conviction even beyond what he himself imagined The Trial was the longest and most solemn that ever was known in this Country and the Judges were even obliged by Necessity to break through an established Custom and Law and adjourned the Court on Account of the absolute Impossibility of supporting without Interruption the Fatigues of so long a Trial Mr  Stewart  intended to have abridged their Trouble by resting his Defence intirely on the Pursuer's Evidence without adducing a single Witness of his own But he was overruled in this by his Council who approved of the Confidence arising from Innocence but still insisted upon having two Witnesses adduced for all the principle Facts upon which he grounded his Defence  Several of the Jury had been Volunteers during the Rebellion and all of them were particularly distinguished by their warm Zeal for the Government As some People had been foolish enough to make this Trial a Party Business all  Mr  Stewart  's Friends were alarmed when the  saw the Names of the Jury For tho' they wer  sensible of the Probity of these Gentlemen ye  they dreaded their Prejudices and were afraid▪ that Truth and Innocence would not obtain so full a Triumph as they did afterwards over Pas+sion and PartyZeal  I can assure you the King's Advocate did no  want Keenness in this Affair to give the mildes  Appellation to his Conduct And here I mus  inform you that what I heard of his Speech sug+gested to me a Remark which I had often made▪ to the Honour of our Age and Nation in one Particular above the antient Times of  Greec  and  Rome  Mr  Grant  was very copious in insisting on the Suspicions this Country lay under with Regard to  Jacobitism  the apparent Diffidence the Ministry had shewn to trust us with the Trials of the Rebels the strong Conviction every one in  England  had of Mr  Stewart  's Guilt and the great Scandal his Acquital would bring on the Country to which he added that a very slight Punishment was intended a few Days Imprisonment and a small Fine which one so rich as Mr  Stewart  could easily bear But though you know that such extraneous and popular Topicks as these are very usual in all the Poems and Epilogues of  Cicero  and even of  Demosthenes  yet I can assure you this Imitation of the antient Orators was not at all approved of either by the Jury or the Bystanders  You will be very much surprized I suppose to hear that many of the  Whigs  have betrayed such a furious Zeal on this Occasion that they are mortified or rather indeed inraged to the last Degree that an innocent Man has been found  innocent And this has given Occasion to the  pposite Party to make his Acquital a Matter of infinite Triumph and Rejoicing as much almost as the Defeat of  Val  or the Surprizal of  Bergenopzoom  or any other publick Calamity  hat has ever befallen us Whatever opposes or  isappoints the Government will always be without Distinction a great Satisfaction to them  But I shall further explain to you the great Difference betwixt a political and a religious  Whig  in Order to account for these odd Tran  actions The Idea I form of a political  Whig  is  hat of a Man of Sense and Moderation a Lover of Laws and Liberty whose chief Regard to particular Princes and Families is founded on a Regard to the publick Good The Leaders of this Party amongst us are Men of great Worth  he President for instance and Lord Justice Clerk especially the Former I fay  especially  he Former  for tho' 'tis certain the Conduct of the Justice Clerk was altogether commendable as far as the Circumstances and Situations in which he was placed would admit yet that of the President has been so singularly good and great  to be the Subject of Admiration and even of Envy if Virtue could ever excite that Passion  The religious  Whigs  are a very different Set of Mortals and in my Opinion are much worse than the religious  Tories  as the political  Tories  are inferior to the political  Whigs  I know not how it happens but it seems to me that a Zeal for Bishops and for the Book of CommonPrayer tho' equally groundless has never been able when mixt up with Party Notions to form so virulent and exalted a Poison in human Breasts as  he opposite Principles Dissimulation Hypocrisy  Violence Calumny Selfishness are generall  speaking the true and legitimate Offspring of th  Kind of Zeal  This Species of  Whigs  whatever they ma  imagine form but the Fagend of the Party▪ and are at the Bottom very heartily despised b  their own Leaders Once on a Time indeed the Breech got over the Head when  Cromwel  ▪ Ireton    Warriston  c ruled our Councils an  Armies and then there was fine Work indeed▪ But ever since though their Assistance has bee  taken at Elections and they have been allowed▪ in Return to rail and make a Noise as much a  they please they have had but little Influence o  our publick Determinations and long may  continue so  These are Mr  Stewart  's greatest and indeed▪ only Enemies The political  Whigs  are man  of them his personal Friends and all of them are extremely pleased with his Acquital becau  they believe what is indeed undeniable th  it was founded on his Innocence I am charitabl  enough to suppose that the Joy of many of th  Tories  flowed from the same Motive And as t  those if there were any such who had a dif+ferent Motive he will not I believe give the  any Thanks for a Concern which is more like  to hurt than to serve him  FINIS
