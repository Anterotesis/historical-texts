 Gucht Sculp  AN ESSAY ON THE History  and  Reality OF APPARITIONS BEING An Account of what they are and what they are not whence they come and whence they come not  AS ALSO  How we may distinguish between the Apparitions of Good and Evil Spirits and how we ought to Behave to them WITH A great Variety of Surprizing and Diverting Examples never Publish'd before  By Death transported to th' Eternal Shore  Souls so remov'd revisit us no more  Engross'd with Joys of a Superior Kind  They leave the trifling Thoughts of Life behind  LONDON  Printed And Sold by  ROBERTS  in  WarwickLane  M DCC XXVII  THE PREFACE  _A VERY short Preface may suffice to a Work of this Nature  Spectre  and  Apparition  make a great Noise in the World and have at least formerly had a great Influence among us  Between our Ancestors laying too much stress upon them and the present Age endeavouring wholly to explode and despise them the World seems hardly ever to have come at a right Understanding about them  Some despise them in such an extraordinary manner that they pretend to wish for nothing more than to be convinc'd by  nstration as if nothing but seeing  the  Devil  could satisfie them there wa  such a Person and nothing is more wonderful to me in the whole System of  Spirits  than that Satan does not think fit to justify the Reality of his Being by appearing to such in some of his worst Figures and tell them in full Grimace who he is when I doubt not but they would be as full of the  Pannick  as other People  Again some People are so horribly frighted at the very mention of an Apparition that they cannot go two Steps in the dark or in the dusk of the Evening without looking behind them and if they see but a Bat fly they think of the  Devil  because of its Wings and as for a Screech Owl at its first appearance they make no scruple of running into the House in a Fright and affirming they have seen the  Devil  How to bring the World to a right Temper between these Extreams is a Difficulty we cannot answer for but if setting things in a true light between Imagination and solid Foundation will assis  towards it we hope this Work may hav  some Success  Not that I expect to fortify my Readers and establish their Minds against the Fears of what they may see so that they shall make an Apparition of the  Devil  familiar to them there is such a kind of Aversion in the Minds of Men to the  Angel of Light  that no body cares to see him in Imagination much less to be forc'd to see him whether they will or no  But now on the other hand if it is true that the  Devil  very rarely does appear that almost all real Apparitions are of friendly and assisting Angels and come of a kind and beneficent Errand to us and that therefore we need not be so terrified at them as we are if it be true that when any evil Spirit does appear it is limited by a Superior Power and can do us no harm without special Licence methinks this should take off the Terror from our Minds and cause us to arm our Souls with Resolution enough to meet the  Devil  whatever Shape he thinks fit to appear in For I must tell you  Good People  as was said in another Case he that is not able to see the  Devil  in whatever Shape he is pleas'd to appear in is not really qualified to live in this World no not in the quality of a common Inhabitant  But the Mistake lies chiefly here that we either will allow no Apparition at all or will have every Apparition be the  Devil  as if none of the Inhabitants of the World above were able to show themselves here or had any Business among us but the  Devil  who I am of the Opinion has really less Business here than any of them all nay we have some reason to believe he has indeed no Business here at all but that of a  roaring Lyon  c and therefore if you meet him and had Courage for it the properest Question you could ask him would be not  In the Name of GOD what art thou  but  In the Name of GOD what  Business  hast thou here  Bid him be gone to his Den and tell him you will pray to God to chain him up else I dare say he would turn Tayl at such an Attack seriously made and it would be the best way in the World to get rid of him  That we  ay then be perfectly easy about this undetermin'd thing call'd Apparition I have endeavour'd here to bring the thing into a narrow Compass and to see it in a true light I  ave first given you several Specimens of real Apparitions well attested and the truth of them so affirm'd that they may be depended upon If in any of them I am not so well assur'd of the Fact tho' they may be as certain yet I have frankly told you so and adher'd to the Moral only But all together may convince the Reader of the Reason and Reality of the thing it self  On the other hand I have given you Specimens of those Am  sements and Delusions which have been put upon the World for Apparitions and you may see the difference is so Notorious whether the Cheat be Political or Whimsical Magical or Imaginary that no Man can be easily deceiv'd that will but make use of the Eyes of his Understanding as well as of those in his Head  If after all you will give up your Reason to your Fancy which at best is but  a Distemper and that you will call every Shadow an Apparition and every Apparition a  Devil  you must be content to be the Subject of constant Delusion for he that will imagine he sees the  Devil  always about him whether Satan is really near him or no shall never want walking Shado  s to amuse him 'till he really calls up t  e  Devil  he fears and bespeaks the Mischief he was before in Danger

all the  Arcana  of the invisible World I know no One Thing about which more has been said and less understood than this of Apparition It is divided so much between the Appearance of good and the Apparition of bad Spirits that our Thoughts are strangely confus'd about it  FIRST We make a great deal of Difficulty to resolve whether there are any such things as Apparitions or no and some People are for reducing them all into Fancy Whimsie and the Vapours and so shutting the Door against Apparitions in general  they resolve to receive no Visits from the invisible World nor to have any Acquaintance with its Inhabitants 'till they come there Not satisfy'd with that they resolve for us all as well as for themselves and will have it that because they have no Notion of it themselves therefore there is really no such thing and this they have advanc'd with great Assurance as well in Print as in other Discourses I name no body  I HAVE I believe as true a Notion of the Power of Imagination as I ought to have and you shall hear farther from me upon that Head I believe we form as many Apparitions in our Fancies as we see really with our Eyes and a great many more nay our Imaginations sometimes are very diligent to embark the Eyes and the Ears too in the Delusion and persuade us to believe we see Spectres and Appearances and hear Noises and Voices when indeed neither the  Devil  or any other Spirit good or bad has troubled themselves about us  BUT it does not follow from thence that therefore there are no such Things in Nature that there is no Intercourse or Communication between the World of Spirits and the World we live in that the Inhabitants of the invisiblc Spaces  be those where you please  have no Converse with us and that they never take the Liberty to stop down upon this Globe or to visit their Friends here and in short that they have nothing to do with or say to us or we with or to them The Enquiry is not as I take it whether they do really come hither or no but who they are that do come  SPIRIT is certainly something that we do not fully understand in our present confined Circumstances and as we do not fully understand the thing so neither can we distinguish of its Operations As we at present conceive of it 'tis an unrestrain  d unlimited Being except by such Laws of the invisible  State which at present we know little of its way of conversing we know nothing of other than this that we bel  eve and indeed see Reason for it that it can act in an invisible and imperceptible manner it moves without being prescrib'd or limited by Space it can come and not be seen go and not be perceiv'd 'tis not to be shut in by Doors or shut out by Bolts and Bars in a Word it is unconfined by all those Methods which we confine our Actions by or by which we understand ourselves to be limited and prescrib'd  YET notwithstanding all this it converses here is with us and among us corresponds tho' unembodied with our Spirits which are embodied and this conversing is by not only an invisible but to us an inconceivable way it is neither tied down to Speech or to Vision but moving in a superior Orb conveys its Meaning to our Understandings its Measures to our Conceptions deals with the Imagination and works it up to receive such Impressions as serve for its purpose and yet at the same time we are perfectly passive and have no Agency in or Knowledge of the Matter  BY this silent Converse all the kind Notices of approaching Evil or Good are convey'd to us which are sometimes so evident and come with such an irresistible Force upon the Mind that we must be more than stupid if we do not perceive them and if we are not extremely wanting to our selves we may take such due Warning by them as to avoid the Evils which we had Notice of in that manner and to embrace the Good that is offer'd to us Nor are there many People alive who can deny but they have had such Notices by which if they had given due Attention to them they had been assisted to save themselves from the Mischiefs which followed or had on the other hand taken hold of such and such  Advantages as had been offer'd for their Good for it is certainly one of the grand and most important Difficulties of human Life to know whether such or such things which present in our ordinary or extraordinary Circumstances are for our good as they seem to be and as may be pretended or not and whether it is proper for us to accept them or no and many unhappily stand in the Way of their own Prosperity for want of knowing what to accept of and what to refuse  NOW by what Agency must it be that we have Directions for good or foreboding Thoughts of Mischiefs which attend us and which it is otherwise impossible we should know any thing of if some intelligent Being who can see into Futurity had not convey'd the Apprehensions into the Mind and had not caused the Emotion which alarms the Soul  AND how should that intelligent Being whatever it is convey these Forebodings and sudden Misgivings as we rightly call them into the Mind if there was not a certain Correspondence between them a way of talking perfectly unintelligible to us uncommon and without the Help of Sounds or any other perceptible Way  For Spirits without the Helps of Voice converse  AS thus there is a Converse of Spirits an Intelligence or call it what you please between our Spirits embodied and cased up in Flesh and the Spirits unembodied who inhabit the unknown Mazes of the invisible World those Coasts which our Geography cannot describe who between  Somewhere  and  Nowhere  dwell none of us know  where  and yet we are sure must have Locality and for ought we know are very near us why should it be thought so strange a thing that those Spirits  should be able to take upon them an Outside or Case why should they not be able on Occasion or when they think fit to dress themselves up as we do  a la Masquerade  in a Habit disguis'd like Flesh and Blood to deceive human Sight so as to make themselves visible to us As they are free Spirits why may they not be like what my Lord  Rochester  expresses in another Case  A Spirit free to chuse for their own Share  What Case of Flesh and Blood they please to wear  Roch  Sat against Man  I do not by this affirm that it is so and that a Spirit may thus assume a real Case of Flesh and Blood for I resolve to affirm nothing that will not bear a Proof and to suggest nothing without Probability in all this Work  BUT it is enough to the present purpose if these invisible Inhabitants can assume an Appearance a Form sufficient to make them perceptible to us at the same time not being at all vested with any Substance much less of the Species which they represent  IF they can assume a visible Form as I see no Reason to say they cannot there is no room then to doubt of the Reality of their appearing because what  may be  we cannot but believe sometimes  has been  as what  has been  we are sure  may be  TO say that the unembodied Spirits can have nothing to do with us and that we have Reason to believe they are not at all acquainted with human Affairs is to say what no Man can be assured of and therefore is begging the Question in the grossest manner  I SHALL therefore spend but very little time to prove or to argue for the Reality of Apparition Let Mr  Glanville  and his Antagonists the  Hobbists  and  Sadduces  of those Times be your Disputants upon that Subject nor shall I trouble you with much Antiquity or History a little that is most unexceptionable may be necessary If there is an invisible World and if Spirits residing or inhabiting are allowed to be there or placed there by the supreme governing Power of the Universe it will be hard to prove that 'tis impossible they should come hither or that they should not have Liberty to show themselves here and converse in this Globe as well as in all the other Globes or Worlds which for ought we know are to be found in that immense Space Reason does not exclude them Nature yields to the Possibility and Experience with a Cloud of Witnesses in all Ages confirm the Reality of the affirmative  THE Question therefore before me is not so much whether there are any such things as Apparitions of Spirits but WHO and WHAT and from WHENCE they are what Business they come about who sends them or directs them and how and in what manner we ought to think and act and behave about them and to them and this is the Substance of this Undertaking  THE Angels are said to be  ministring Spirits  and we know they have been made use of as such on many Occasions by the superior Appointment of him that created them why then it may not be thought fit by the same Power to make or substitute a Ministration of these unembodied Spirits to the Service of the embodied Souls of Men which are also God's Creatures we cannot tell  UPON what foot and to what end either on their Side or on ours and from what Appointment is very difficult to ascertain and yet some probable Guesses might be made at it too if it was the proper Work before me but I am rather adjusting the Fact and asc  rtaining the Reality of Apparitions in  general than inquiring into the Reasons of them either the Reasons in Nature or in Providence which are perhaps farther out of our Reach than some People imagine  IT is as difficult too to determine whether the Spirits that appear are good or evil or both the only Conclusion upon that Point is to be made from the Errand they come about and it is a very just Conclusion I think for if a Spirit or Apparition comes to or haunts us only to terrify and affright to fill the Mind with Horror and the House with Disorder we cannot reasonably suppose that to be a good Spirit and on the other hand if it comes to direct to any Good or to forewarn and preserve from any approaching Evil it cannot then be reasonable to suppose 'tis an evil Spirit  THE Story of an Apparition disturbing a young Gentleman at or near  Cambridge  is remarkable to this Purpose He set up it seems for a kind of profess'd Atheism but hearing a Voice supposed it was the  Devil  spoke to him and yet owned that the Voice assured him  there was a God  and  bid him repent  It was a most incongruous Suggestion that the  Devil  should come Voluntier to an Atheist and bid him repent or that the  Devil  should with a like Freedom assert the Being of a GOD  IF then it was a real Apparition of or a Voice from an invisible Spirit I say  if  because it might be a Phantom of his own Imagination it must be from a good Spirit or from an evil Spirit overrul'd by a superior and beneficent Power and if that were to be supposed then it would justify our taking farther Notice of those things called Voices and Apparitions than I shall venture to advise  THE Possibility however of Apparitions and the Certainty of a World of Spirits as I can by no means doubt so I shall take up none of your time to answer the Objections and Cavils of other  People about it because I think the Evidence will amount to a Demonstration of the Facts and Demonstration puts an end to Argument  CHAP I Of Apparitions in particular the Reality of them their Antiquity and the Difference between the Apparitions of former Times and those which we may call Modern with something of the Reason and Occasion of that Difference  NOTHING can be a stronger Testimony of the Reality of Apparitions in General than to descend to the particular Appearances which we are assur'd have been seen and convers'd with from the superior World And first I begin with such as have been evidently from Heaven it self and by the soveraign Appointment of Providence upon extraordinary Occasions And tho' I shall trouble my Readers with as little as possible out of Scripture especially at the Beginning of my Work because I am unwilling they should throw it by before they read it out which there would be some Danger of if I should begin too grave  YET as I cannot go back to Originals or begin at the Beginning without a little History out of those ancient Times you must bear with my just naming the Sacred Historians I'll be as short as I can  NOTHING is more certain if the Scripture is at all to be believed among us than that GOD himself was pleased in the Infancy of Things to appear Visibly and in Form to several Persons and  on several Occasions upon Earth assuming or taking up the Shape of his Creature Man when he thought fit to converse with him that he might not be a Terror to him  THUS  Adam  was frequently visited in  Eden  and we have no room to doubt but it was in a visible Form because  Adam  both heard him speak and as the Text says  They heard the Voice of the  Lord God  walking in the Garden in the Cool of the Day  Gen iii  BY all the History of the Antediluvean World we have reason to believe that as God did frequently speak to Men so he as frequently appear'd to them for we find they conversed with God Face to Face  Cain  tho' wicked talk'd with GOD and GOD with him when he was charg'd with the Murther of his Brother  Abel  and the Text is express  Gen  iv that after it  Cain went out from the Presence of the Lord  So that God not only spoke to him by a voice but was Visible and Present to him  AND as I must carry the  Devil  along with me hand in hand in every Period of Time so even in  Paradise  the  Devil  assum'd a Shape For we must allow Satan to be a Spirit and indeed we have good reason to say he is  a Spiri  free  to CHUSE what  Case of Flesh and Blood  he pleases to put on or at least seemingly to put on  THUS he without doubt spoke in the Mouth of the Serpent in the Garden or else took upon himself that Shape tho' the former is the most probable because the Serpent was curst for being but the Instrument however passive he might be  MR  MILTON  makes no doubt of the Devil's assuming a Shape of any kind  Beast  as well as  Man  when he brings him in whispering to  Eve  in her Sleep and placing himself close at her Ear in the Shape of a Toad which he expresses in his Sublime  Poem and with that inimitable Manner peculiar to himself  FIRST he brings Satan leaping over the Mound or Fence which God had placed round the Garden as a Wolf leaps over the Hurdles into a Sheepfold and being gotten into Paradise he places himself upon the Tree of Life in the Shape of a  Raven  or Cormorant There's the  Devil  's first Apparition  THENCE he views the whole Garden and all the Creatures in it and at last he spies  Adam  and  Eve  to his great Surprise But after a while spent in admiring their Form their Beauty Felicity and Innocence as he resolv'd to ruin them so he comes down from the Tree to be nearer them and mixing among the Cattle where he takes upon him now one Shape then another as it best suited him to be near  Adam  and  Eve  and yet to be unperceived by them this the Poet describes thus  Then from his lofty Stand on that high Tree  Down he alights among the sportful Herd  Of those fourfooted Kinds  himself now one  Now other  as their  Shape  best serv'd his End  Nearer to view his Prey and unespy'd  To mark what of their State he more might learn  About them round  A Lion now  he stalks with fiery Glare  Then  as a  Tiger  Milt Parad lib IV ver  Again when he makes the Angels find Satan as I have observed whispering evil Thoughts to  Eve  in a Dream and in her Sleep he says  Him there they found  Squat  like a Toad  close at the Ear of  Eve  Assaying by his devilish Art to reach  The Organs of her Fancy and with them forge  Illusions as he list Phantasms and Dreams  Ib ver  'TIS evident then that the  Devil  can assume a Shape whether of Man or Beast and appear as such in order to disguise himself from our Sight We shall have a farther Account of him presently but in the mean time let us see higher and go into the AfterAges  ABRAHAM  is the first Example after  Noah  of an open Converse with his Maker and the Scripture distinguishes the very manner sometimes 'tis said that the Lord  had said to Abram  Gen xii and again the  Lord said to Abram  Gen xiii again  The Word of the Lord came to Abram  and  the Word of the Lord came to Abram in a Vision  Gen xv to the th  BUT there are other express Places in which it is said in plain Words God appeared to him Gen xii  The Lord appear'd unto Abram  and Gen xvii  The Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him  and ver  And he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham  'Tis undeniable that God appeared and was with him and left off talking with him and went from him all Marks of a visible Apparition  AGAIN Chap xviii here it is still more explicit and God not only appeared but appeared in a Human Shape Ver  And the Lord appeared to him in the Plains of Mamre as he sat in the Door of his Tent  First 'tis said he lift up his Eyes and looked and behold three Men stood by him So visible were they that he entertains them  invites them to Dinner and prepares a fat Calf to be dress'd and Cakes and Butter and Milk In short he made a Feast so much was he as it may be said deluded so real was the Appearance nay when he sat it all before them 'tis said thy DID EAT  NOW ver 'tis said expresly one of these was the LORD nay in the Original it is JEHOVAH that was when he charg'd  Sarah  with laughing and she deny'd it  N B Sarah  was the first of Human Kind that ever told GOD a LYE to his Face But she was frighted that's certain the Text says so  IN the th Verse when God tells  Abraham  what he had resolv'd to do to  Sodom  'tis plain he speaks in the first Person as God  And the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do  Hereupon  Abraham  takes upon him to plead with God in behalf of  Sodom  and in this he speaks as to God himself ver  O let not the Lord be angry and I will speak  and before that ver  Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the  LORD  which am but Dust and Ashes  THUS I think 'tis evident that God himself did appear in Humane Shape to  Abraham  and that more than once The next Chapter is as plain that he did the same to LOT or if it should be objected that it is not so clear that it was God himself it was two Angels tho' Interpreters do generally agree that it was Christ himself who is called an Angel the Angel of the Covenant But if that were doubtful then it will still be allow'd that it was an Apparition of Angels in Human Shape which will stand good in my next Article  BUT as I am upon the Highest and Supreme Instances first I must finish it by two particular  Quotations which cannot be disputed One is of  Jacob  Gen xxxii  There wrestled a man with him  and ver the Man is said to be GOD himself  as a Prince hast thou Power with  GOD  and hast prevail'd  and ver after he had blessed him  Jacob  call'd the Place  Peniel  that is  the Face of  GOD For says he  I have seen  GOD  Face to Face  Again  Jacob  says Gen xlviii  God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the Land of Canaan and blessed me  BUT there is yet a stronger Testimony than all this for it is spoken from the Mouth of GOD himself upon a very particular Occasion which was to honour  Moses  and establish him in the Reverence and Regard of the People when the Seventy Men or Elders were appointed to take Part of his Work off his Hands and judge of smaller Matters among the People which is nobly express'd Numb xi  They shall bear the Burthen of the People with thee  In the next Chapter  Miriam  and even  Aaron  himself spake against  Moses  that is in short rose in Rebellion and God to honour his Servant tells them how he had and would distinguish  Moses  from all the rest ver  With him will I speak Mouth  to  Mouth  even APPARENTLY  and not in Dark Speeches  and  the Similitude of the  LORD  shall be  BEHOLD  HERE is a positive Declaration from Heaven that GOD would appear visibly to  Moses  the like Instance is not to be seen in the whole Bible The Word  Apparently  is plain it can be no otherwise understood without gross Equivocating with the Text  COME we next to the Times of our Blessed Saviour and there we have two eminent Appearances within the Compass of our present Argument  THE HOLY GHOST appearing in the Shape of a  Dove  THE Appearance of JESUS CHRIST after his Resurrection when in the glorify'd Body wherewith he ascended and that this was an Apparition is plain from the several Circumstances of his Appearance  FIRST  When he join'd the two Disciples going to  Emaus  that he appear'd as a Man the Text is plain from his walking with them and Discourse to them and that it was but an Apparition is also plain Luke xxiv  Their Eyes were holden that they should not know him  and ver when their Eyes were opened to know him he vanished out of their Sight  SECONDLY  When he appear'd to  Mary Magdalen  at the Sepulchre but forbad her to touch him  John  xx And again  ver  when he came into the Room where the Disciples were assembled and when the Doors were shut and said  Peace be unto to you  Thus it is evident Christ has appear'd and he has told us he shall appear again coming in the Clouds of Heaven and we look for that blessed Hope and glorious Appearing  THUS then you have GOD himself  Father Son  and  Holy Ghost  appearing in distinct Times in several Shapes or Forms of Appearance all giving Testimony in general to the Reality of this Truth That Spirits can assume Humane or other Shapes and be made visible to Mankind and this is what we call Apparition  HAVING thus brought an Instance of the most exalted Kind even the Appearance or Apparition of God himself 'tis needful to state a little the Difference between those Appearances and that which we are now to discourse of  'TIS an Objection natural to the Case in hand We do not question much less enquire whether  infinite Power to whom all things are not possible only but easy can assume a Humane Shape or any other and appear  when where how  and in  what Form  he thinks fit and that he has or may have so appeared But there is a manifest Difference between what God is able or may please to do upon extraordinary Occasions and what any of his Creatures may or can do  BESIDES 'tis evident or at least we have reason to believe that God himself did appear in those Times upon those extraordinary Occasions only and that he has never appear'd since except that should be call'd an Appearance or Apparition which spoke to St  Paul  at his Conversion when it is expresly said he saw a Light and heard a Voice but saw no Man tho' afterwards he calls it seeing him  Cor  xv  Last of all he was seen of me also  Whereas St  Paul  we all know did speak there of seeing Christ in the Flesh while he was on Earth But I say except this we have no Example of any Appearance of the Divine Majesty in Humane Shape or in any other manner whatsoever  THAT therefore we must distinguish this from the Subject we are now entering upon for  hat the Appearances of God are extremely different from the Apparitions of Creatures whether Angels Devils or Souls of Men That the Question is not Whether God can do this or that but Whether the Spirits Spirits Inferior can do it and which is yet more to our Purpose Suppose it has been so formerly and in ancient times whether they do continue to do so still or have power to do it let the Occasion be what it will  THUS the Enquiry is reduc'd to a narrower Compass I take upon me the Affirmative and we are now to look back into Time for the Confirmation or Proof of it and by enquiring what has been inform our selves of what may be is or is to be expected as occasion may require  AND first to describe the Thing and explain what is generally understood by the Apparition of Spirits that I may not hold you in Suspence or Criticise upon the bare Words  Spirit  and  Apparition  I come plainly to the Meaning as I am to be understood in this Work By  Apparition  of Spirits then I mean when the Invisible Inhabitants of the unknown World be they who they will assume Humane Shapes or other Shapes and show themselves visibly to us so as that we can see them speak to them hear them speak and the like  THIS is what our People vulgarly call  Walking  and when any such thing appears they know not what otherwise to call it they say  Something walks  and if it be the Appearance of any known Person lately dead they say  Such a one Walks  THUS I lay every thing down with the utmost plainness that I may leave the Reader in no Uncertainty about my Meaning in the Subject I am upon or give room for Cavilings or Disputings at either the Thing it self or the manner of Expressing ti  We speak in Vain  Of Truth it self unless we speak it Plain  Words wrapt in Clouds till their full Meaning's known  Such Words are not the Hearer's but our own  The End of Speaking's lost  For Speech was given to be understood  ASKING Pardon for giving this Loose to m  Thoughts I return to the Subject left I shoul  be but an Apparition my self  THE Apparitions I am to speak of are these  THE Appearance of Angels  OF Devils  OF the departed Souls of Men  THESE are those who we mean by the Inhabitants of the Invisible World or Worlds the World of Spirits and the Superior Beings who are said to converse with the Spirits embodied by Vision or Apparition or any other Superior Way  BY Apparition also I am to understand such Appearances of these superior Beings as are Spontaneous and Voluntary or at least so far as relates to us that is to say I distinguish between those Apparitions which appear of their own accord or by superior Mission and Authority and those which that dark Race of People among us who would be call'd Magicians talk of Spirits or things call'd Spirits which are raised as we foolishly call it by the Arts of Men by Witchcraft Sorcery Magick and such other Infernal Arts as are or have been made use of for that Purpose and by which they tell us Spirits are call'd down from the superior Regions o  whereever their Abode has been to show themselves visibly speak to and converse with Mankind answer Questions foretel Events and the like as  Samuel  is said to be brought to appear to  Saul    Sam  xxviii How far these Magicians Witches and other Dealers in these dark Things  ave or have not Power to cause such Appearan  es and to sorm Apparitions and how far they  mpose upon and delude the World in it That I may speak of by it self and indeed it well deserves Consideration But for the present I say I am talk  ng of another Kind of Apparitions  CHAP II Of the Appearance of Angels immediately in Mission as from Heaven and why we are to suppose those kinds of Apparitions are at an End  THAT Angels have appeared to Men we have abundant Testimony in the Histories of Times Past as well Sacred as Prophane nor shall I spend one Moment of your Time to examine or confirm it except as it comes necessarily in by the occasion of other Discourse For it is not the Appearance of Angels as such but the Appearance of Angels in the Shape of Men that is the present Enquiry  THAT this has been is evident and in general the Scripture gives this Testimony to it when the Apostle advises to Hospitality and to entertain Strangers he adds  For thereby some have entertain'd  Angels  unawares  Heb xiii This must be meant of Angels in Humane Shape otherwise the hospitable Person could not be mistaken in such a manner Besides it plainly refers to  Abraham Gen  xviii sitting in the Door of his Tent  ver  three Men stood by him two of these were certainly Angels who the third was I have shewn already It may likewise include  Lot  in whose Story  Gen  xix it is express'd  ver  that they were two Angels and  ver    Lot  calls them  these Men  and  ver  they are called  the Men  so that LOT believ'd them to be Men only and as such he not only invited them unto his House  ver  but he made them a Feast and they did eat  ver    THESE Apparitions of Angels in the Shape of Men are undeniable on other Occasions but when they appear as Angels it is said so plainly and in so many Words as in the Case of  Abraham  when he was going to offer his Son  Isaac  Gen xxii  The Angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of Heaven  and again ver  The Angel of the Lord called the second time  THERE are innumerable Examples of Angels appearing as Angels but we are upon the Appearance of Angels as Men and in the Shape and Habit of Men The next Instance is of an Angel appearing to  Joshua  and who is called the Captain of the Lord's Host  Josh  v  Joshua looked and behold there stood a Man overagainst him with a Sword drawn in his Hand  Immediately  Joshua  Soldierlike gives him the  qui vive  or in  English who are you for  art thou for us or for our Adversaries and the Spectre or Apparition spoke immediately again  ver  and then  Joshua  perceived that it was not a Man but an Angel in Apparition and in the Heads or Contents of the Chapter 'tis expresly said  an Angel appears to  Joshua  ANOTHER Example is of the Angel that appear'd to  Manoah  the Father of  Sampson  his Wife indeed calls him a Man of God and that he appear'd to her but says that his Countenance was like an Angel of God very terrible  Judges  xiii But still when he appear'd a second time it was in the Shape of a Man or else why did  Manoah  desire him to stay 'till he could dress a Kid for him and the Words are express ver  He knew not that it was an Angel of the Lord  THERE are other Examples in Scripture where the Angels have appeared in Humane Shape and convers'd with Men upon Earth besides such as have appear'd in their real Angelick Form as Angels How and in what they were known to be  Angels in what Form they have been seen and in what Voice they spoke is not discover'd to us in the Scripture Some are of Opinion that even those Angels appear'd in the Shape of Men and cloathed as Men as the Angel that met  Balaam  with a flaming Sword in his Hand the Angels which  Jacob  saw ascending and descending on the Ladder the Angels that spoke to  Zacharias  in the Temple to the  Virgin Mary  in the Chamber and that sat in the Sepulchre after Christ was risen and asked the Disciples  why seek ye the Living among the Dead  and so in several Cases All that can be answer'd is that the Text call'd them Angels and so far we are not to doubt it but I must also allow that they seem to me to have been in the Figure of Men as for those in the Sepulchre St  Luke  says expresly they saw  two Men  in shining Garments  Luke  xxiv and in the same Chapter ver 'tis said they had seen a Vision of Angels  THUS far it relates to good Angels such as have been seen on Earth in Apparition but have made such an Appearance by vertue of the superior Mission as the Angel  Gabriel  who tells  Zacharias I am sent to speak unto thee  THAT these have upon many occasions been seen in Humane Shape is evident and tho' much more time might be spent upon the Proof I think 'tis needless indeed the Evidence is sufficient  THERE is a Question still remaining relating to this Part  viz  How comes it to pass that all this is ceased and that the Angels have done coming or are no more sent of such Errands but that all the Angels we have any Account of in these Days are of a worse kind and generally come upon worse Errands and which particular Observation is the very reason of our Doubts whether the Appearance of the other is real or not  THIS Question might be answer'd many Ways but 'tis too grave for the Times and as we are not writing Divinity I shall not load you with serious Points The short Account of it is this  We have  now  a more sure Word of Prophecy  that is that since the Preaching of the Gospel and the Revelation of God by a written Word there is no more need of what the Text calls  a ministration of Angels  The Scripture is a daily Revelation and the Spirit of God who is promised to lead us is a daily Inspiration there is no more need of Vision and Apparition and this is that glorious Difference between the Revelations of those Days and these of ours and the reason of the Difference between the Apparitions of these Times and of those  WHEN I am speaking things serious I am to speak very short that I may not shock your reading the Taste of the Times happening at this Juncture to lye another way but my next Article perhaps may make you amends I mean the Appearance of the grand ArchAngel of all and as I suppose the only ArchAngel out of Heaven namely the Devil  CHAP III Of the  APPEARANCE  of the  DEVIL  in Humane Shape  PRAY observe when I am speaking of the Appearance of the Devil it is not to tell you that he can and does appear among us at this time so you need not look over your Shoulders to see for him or at the Candles to see  if they burn BLUE at least not yet 'tis time enough for that by and by  BUT I am examining now the matter of Fact only as Whether the Devil can appear here yea or no whether he is allow'd to come that his Chain reaches so far and that his Tether is long enough also Whether he is ever sent or directed to come or that he comes of his own accord and about his own Business And as all these will lead me to enquire what has been from thence we may best judge what is or may be  THAT he has upon special Occasions appear'd in former Times is certain as well from Scripture as ancient History and a small Retrospect will satisfie you in that Point If it appears that he has been here then 'tis very probable his Chain is long enough and that he is allow'd the Liberty to come so far from Home For we have no Authority to say or to believe that his Tether is shorten'd or that he is more restrain'd now than ever he was before  HIS entring the Garden of God in the beginning of Time and the Havock he made there the turning  Adam  and  Eve  out and even turning the whole frame of Nature upside down by his vile Doings there all this I have mention'd But we have more yet to say of him for he is still in Being and still the same malicious Devil the same Destroyer and Accuser that ever he was the Flame of Fire set to guard the Garden did not burn him the Deluge didn't drown him Nor has Justice thought fit yet to take him into its Iron Hands tho' it will certainly do it at last and as the Scripture says in another Case his Damnation slumbereth not for Justice is truly represented  With Leaden Feet and Iron Hands to show  It will be certain tho' it may be slow  THE first time we meet with the Devil's personal Appearance upon Earth I mean after the Flood is in the Story of  Job  nor by all the Calculations of Times which the learned Chronologers of those Days have made could that be long after it for  Eliphaz  the  Temanite  could not be farther off than the Grandson of  Esau  or thereabouts Gen xxxvi  IN  Job  's Time the Text says that  the Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and  Satan  came also among them  So that it seems the Angel of Light was dress'd up like the Sons of GOD even in those ancient Days and it is not likely that this was the first Time neither Again it seems by the Text that tho' GOD himself might know Satan in that Disguise yet the People among whom he came did not know him  THE Answer likewise which he makes to the Question implies strongly that Satan had been wont to walk among those Sons of God in Disguise long before that for when God sa  s to him  whence comest thou  his Answer seems to be a kind of general I come from following my known Business my old Trade doest thou know I am a roaring Lion and doest thou ask me whence I come Why I come from seeking who I may devour ranging the World  going to and fro in the Earth  and  walking up and down  in this Disguise as thou now seest me that I may do all the Mischief I can  GOD'S Return again to Satan confirms it as if the Lord had said Well Satan then thou must have seen my Servant  Job Hast thou consider'd  him  that there is none like him in the Earth  THE Devil makes an Answer that implies he knew  Job  very well Do I know him to be a good Man yes But then I know him to be a rich Man too 'Tis an easy thing for a Man to be honest that is so rich he can have no room for asking  more What should he steal for or be a Knave for that is the richest Man in the World What should he covet that has no room for Desire But if thou hast a Mind to try his Honesty and his Piety his Fear of thee and his Hatred of Evil blast his Wealth and take his prodigious Flocks and Herds of Cattle away level him bring him to be like other Men in Riches and reduce him to Beggary and then see if he won't be like other Men in Crime nay he'll be raging and furious and  curse thee to thy Face  THIS tho' it may seem remote is to my Purpopse thus it shows that the Devil was no Stranger among the People He had walk'd up and down in Disguise so as to know them all and their Circumstance He had been dress'd up like one of the rest in Human Shape so that he could not be known from the very best of Men no not from the Sons of God  SOME are of Opinion by  the Sons of God  there is meant the patriarchal Heads of Families who had in right of Primogeniture the Priesthood in Course and were the only Sacrificers at that Time as  Abraham  and as  Job  were so that in short Satan has long ago dress'd himself in the Habit of the Clergy Bless us all we hope he does not do so still for if the Devil should put on the Gown and Cassock or the black Cloak or the Coat and the Cord and be walking about the World in that Disguise now how easily may we be cheated and mistake the Sons of God for the Prince of Darkness and how could we tell one from t'other But of that hereafter  CHAP IV Of the Apparition of Spirits Unembodied and which never were Embodied not such as are vulgarly called Ghosts that is to say departed Souls returning again and appearing visibly on Earth but Spirits of a superior and angelick Nature with an Opinion of another Species  THERE appears a Qu  s  ion here in the very Beginning of the Debate which will be very hard to decide and perhaps impossible However that we may not stumble at the Threshold I will touch it as gently and yet as clearly as I can The Question is this Whether are there any Spirits inhabiting the invisible World which have never yet been embodied and yet are not to be reckon'd of the Species of Angels  Good  or  Bad  BY Angels Good and Bad I suppose I may be easily unde  stood to mean what you all think you mean when you sort or rank them into only two Kinds  viz  Angels or  Devils  in which vulgar and general not to say foolish way of expressing it I humbly conceive the selfwise World much mistaken It is true it is a Speculation and every one is at Liberty to think for themselves and among them so am I in which tho' I have a better Opinion of my own Judgment than always to sacrifice it to vulgar Notions and that too at the Price of my Reason yet I have withal so little Pride and so mean an Opinion of my own Thoughts that I shall not venture to advance any thing in a Case so exceedingly liable to Cavil and Exception  TWO Places in Scripture speak of Angels in a different Style from the ordinary and usual way of understanding  the Word  Mat  xviii speaking of little Children Christ says that  in Heaven their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven  the other is  Acts  xii when  Peter  knock'd at the Door where the Disciples were gather'd together and they believing him to be in Chains and in the Prison said  it is his Angel  THE learned Expositors and Annotators extremely differ upon the Meaning of these Texts and 'tis not my Business here to reconcile them Some will have it to mean nothing but a kind of an Exclamation or Admiration What can it be is it an Angel And of the first about Children they say it only intimates that their Souls when glorify'd shall  always  if they go away in Peace  behold the Face of GOD in Heaven  OTHERS run out to an imaginary Scheme of Guardian Angels attending every Man and Woman while they are upon Earth a Notion so uncertain if granted and that has so many Difficulties to reconcile before it can be believed that 'tis much better to leave it where it is and which I shall explain presently a much easier Way  NOW I say 'tis not my present Business to reconcile these distant and clashing Opinions at least not in this Work I have started a Question possibly my Opinion is with the affirmative at least I think it possible and that it is Rational to believe it perhaps I may name you as improbable a Notion and much more inconsistent with the Christian Religion which yet Philosophy bids us call rational and directs us to believe  HOW are we put to it to form Inhabitants for the Planetary Worlds Philosophy says they are habitable Bodies solid opaac as this Earth and we will have them be inhabited also whether it be with or without for or against our Reason and Understanding 'tis no Satisfaction to them or will it  stop their Cavils to say 'tis not Fact that they are not habitable that both  Saturn  and  Jupiter  are uncomfortably dark unsufferably cold would congeal the very Soul if that were possible and so are not habitable on that Account that  Mercury  and  Venus  are insufferably hot that the very Water would always boyl the Fire burn up the Vitals and that in short no human Creatures could subsist in such Heat But this is not satisfactory neither but rather than not have all those opaac Worlds be inhabited and even their  Satellites  or Moons about them too they will have God be obliged to create a Species of Bodies suitable to their several Climates  IN  Saturn  they are to live without Eyes or be a Kind so illuminated from their own internal Heat and Light that they can see sufficiently by their own Beams  IN  Jupiter  there must be another Kind that can live in Twilight and by the Reflection of its own Moons and subsist in continued Frost  IN  Mercury  the Species must be all Salamanders and live in the continued Fire of the Sun's Beams more intense than what would be sufficient to burn all our Houses and melt our Copper Lead and Iron in the very Mines so the Inhabitants must be of a Kind better able to bear the Fire than those Metals and would still live tho' they were continually calcining if not vitrifying into Glass  IN  Venus  the Heat would boil the Water and consequently the Blood in the Body and a Set of human Bodies must be form'd that could live always in a hot Bath and neither sweat out their Souls or melt their Bodies  IN  Mars  so very dry in its Nature no Vegetables or Sensatives could subsist that we have any Notion of for want of Moisture and the Men that liv'd there must be dried up sufficiently for pulverizing on any suitable Occasion I mean human Beings and of our Species  NOW if God must not be supposed to have created so many habitable Bodies without peopling them and that it would reflect upon his Wisdom to lay so much of his Creation waste that all the Planets should seem to be made for nothing but to range about the Waste as a kind of dark Inhabitants of no use but to shine a little and that with but borrow'd Beams too upon this little Point called Earth where only a Set of Rationals can exist I say if this must not be supposed but on the contrary there are certainly People of one Kind or another in all those Bodies let the Trouble of making them be what it will if this be the Case and that this must be believed in spight of so many Difficulties and Inconsistencies then allow me to argue a little upon the following Enquiry  WHY may I not as well suggest and that with every jot as much Probability that there are or at least may be a certain Number of appointed Inhabitants in the vastlyextended Abyss of Space a kind of Spirits other than the Angels good or bad and other than the unembodied or uncased Souls of Men who dwell in the invisible World and in the Vast  Nowhere  of unbounded Space of which we can neither say what it is what it contains or how determined That Great Waste of whose Extent 'tis hardly possible even the Soul itself can conceive and of which all the Accounts we give and Guesses we make are so remote look so Enthusiastic so improbable and so like impossible that instead of informing the ignorant Part of the World by it we only arm them with Jest and Ridicule and resolve them into incurable Unbelief depending that what it is not possible to Conceive of is not possible to Be  NOW is this immense Space indeed a Void is it all a Waste is it utterly desolate or is it inhabited and peopled by the Omnipotent Maker in a manner  suited to his own Glory and with such Inhabitants as are spirituous invisible and therefore perfectly proper to the Place  I MUST needs say 'tis much more rational to suggest this to be than to bring out a Species of human bodies to live in the Intense Heat of  Mercury  or the acute Cold of  Jupiter  and  Saturn  The latter is agreeable to the general Understanding we all have of spirituous Beings We are well assured there are some always there and that they can very well subsist there that the Place is suitable to them and that there are Spirits of some Kind or other and why not such as we suggest  IT remains then only to examine what Communication these Spirits have with us whether they are or are not able to hold Conversation with us and whether they really do converse familiarly with us yea or no  IF it should be granted that there are such Spirits in Being and that they pass and repass exist and have Egress and Regress there that they inhabit as a certain bombastic Author has it  Thro' all the liquid Mazes of the Sky  I say if this should be granted then it remains that here is a fourth Species that may assume Shapes for Spirits may do that and may appear among us may converse with our embodied Spirits and from those we may receive abundance of additional Intelligence from the World of Spirits whether by Dream Vision Appearance or any superior way such as to them in their great Knowledge of things shall seem meet To speak as distinctly of this nice Part as I can admit me to explain my self a little  IF we grant that Spirit tho' invisible in it self may assume Shape may vest it self so with Flesh and Blood that is seemingly so as to form an Appearance  then all Spitit may do it since we have no Rule given us by which we may distinguish Spirits one from another I mean as to their actings in the Capacity of Spirits We may indeed as I have said already distinguish them by the Effect that is to say by the Errand they come on and by the manner of their Operations as whether they are good or evil Spirits but not by their Nature as Spirit The  Devil  is as really a Spirit tho' a degenerated fallen and evil Spirit I say he is as much a Spirit to all the Intents and Purposes of a Spirit that we are capable to judge of as an Angel and he is called the evil Spirit He has Invisibility and Multipresence as a Spirit has he can appear tho' the Doors be shut and go out tho' bolted and barr'd in no Prison can hold him but his last eternal Dungeon no Chains can bind him but the Chains fasten'd on him by Heaven and the Angel of the bottomless Pit no Engine or human Art can wound him in short he is neither to be seen felt heard or understood unless he pleases and he can make himself be both seen and heard too if he pleases for he can assume the Shape and Appearance of Man or Beast and in these Shapes and Appearances can make himself visible to us terrify and affright us converse in a friendly or in a frightful manner with us as he thinks fit he can be a Companion and FellowTraveller in the Day an Apparition and a horrible Monster in the Night in a Word he can be among us and act upon and with us visibly or invisibly as he pleases and as he finds for his purpose  NOW if he does and can do thus meerly as he is a Spirit and by his spiritual Nature we have a great deal of Reason to believe that all Spirit may do the same or at least I may ask Why may not all Spirit do the same and if there are any Kinds  of Spirit as is not improbable besides those we have hitherto conceiv'd of they may be reasonably supposed to be vested with the same Powers and may exert those Powers in the same or a like manner  IF any Man asks me how I make out the Probability of these differing Species of Spirits I answer as above by this That it appears there are invisible Operations and a secret Converse carried on among Men from the World of Spirits whereever that is which cannot at least to our Understandings b  supposed to be the Work either of those particular or proper Angels which reside in Heaven or the infernal Angels either that these Spirits or if you please to call them Angels appear and converse for Good and therefore may not be supposed to be the  Devil  or from the  Devil  It is said indeed that they act by a visible kind of Restraint in doing Good with a sort of an Imperfection and manifest Debility so as sometimes to act as it were to no purpose being not able to make the Good they aim at effectual and therefore cannot be from Heaven the Fountain of Good who as he is Good so he is infinitely able to do all the Good that he appears willing to do But this I think confirms rather than confutes my Opinion for it proves them to be sent and under particular Commission it only suggests that 'tis probable there are Spirits who may be more confin'd and restrain'd in their Power of acting some than others and this is not at all inconsistent with the Nature of the thing  THE great and perhaps the strongest Argument which our learned Men produce for the Credit of their new Philosophy is that by this they can the better solve the Difficulties of several other  Phoenomena  which before were hardly intelligible or at least which they could not account for any other way  IN like manner tho' the Certainty of my Suggestion cannot be arrived to or supposing it cannot and that at best it is but a Speculation scarcely can be called an  Hypothesis  and that no Evidence can be given fo  it yet this must be said of it that by this Notion we may solve several other Difficulties which we cannot understand any other Way  such as  FIRST  HOW it is and from whence or by whose Agency we frequently receive such kind Notions of Good or Evil as 'tis certain we do and yet without receiving any farther Assistance which perhaps it is not in the Power of the kind Informer to give us either for the avoiding or embracing the Evil or the Good which they give us Notice of  WHAT can it be that communicates these approaching distant things and which it is so much our Interest and Concern to know If it were an evil Spirit I mean a  Devil  as I have said above he would never concern himself so much for our Benefit seeing he is known to will our Ruin to the utmost of his Endeavour and to wish us to fall into all possible Mischief and Disaster  ON the other hand it cannot be from Heaven or from the Angels for the Works of God are all like himself perfect and he would not so far dishonour his Messengers as to allow them nay to send them for they could never come unsent to give us Notice of Evil and yet take it out of our Power to avoid it or to foretell good things at hand and then give us no Power to embrace them or to lay hold of them and it would neither consist with the infinite Goodness or with the infinite Justice to do thus by his Creatures  BESIDES 'tis a kind of incongruous acting unworthy of the supreme Power unworthy an Angel's appearing it rather shews that it is the Product  of some intelligent Being who tho' it means Good and has a beneficent Nature that would contribute to our Safety and Prosperity if it could yet is under some Limitations of its actings is not able to proceed in the Good it has attempted that can just do us so much Service as to give us Notice of what may await us behind the dark Curtain of Futurity but has no Power to go any farther or to give any Assistance to us in pursuing proper Methods for our Deliverance no not so much as to give Directions much less Powers to act as a Child discovering a Fire begun in a House may cry out and alarm the Family but is able to do no more no no  so much as to tell them whereabout it is or which way they should go about to escape from it much less to quench or prevent it  THESE imperfect Notices I say seem to proceed from some good and kind Being which is n  ar us existing tho' out of our Knowledge yet not so remote but that it is in Condition to see and know things good or evil which tho' approaching is yet out of our View and which if we could take the silent Hint it might be infinitely for our Advantage but is able to do no more  NOW if such Notices whether to the Mind by Dreams when asleep or by waking Impulse or by Voice or by Apparation if they were from Heaven they would never be so imperfect and unassisting we cannot suppose Heaven would concern itself to give us Notices of Danger impending of Enemies  ying in wait of Mischiefs approaching and would  hen leave us to fall into the Snare by an unavoid  ble Necessity  AS to what these Spirits therefore are where  hey reside what Circumstances they are in and  ow they have access to our Understandings I ac  nowledge the Difficulty to be great and do not pre  nd to enter upon it here that they may sometimes  pear is not improbable But I hope I may say  that all Apparitions are not the  Devil  nor yet may they be Angels immediately from Heaven for many Reasons  FIRST  From the Meanness of the Occasions I mean of some of the Occasions on which these things happen That there are Angels sent from Heaven on particular Messages and Errands to fulfil the Mind and Will of their Maker and Sovereign all Men must grant I have already prov'd it and abundance of Examples may be given of it besides those already named but we never find thos  Angels coming upon trifling Errands and for thing  of mean Import  The Angel of the LORD  appear'd to  Gideon  at the Threshingfloor to summon hi  to the Deliverance of the whole Nation of  ISRAEL  The Angel of the LORD  appear'd to  David  wit  his drawn Sword threatning Destruction of  Jerusalem  The  Angels  appear'd to the Shepherds to signify the Birth of  CHRIST  as an  Angel  had don  to the Virgin to salute her and tell her what grea  a Work was to be wrought in her  Angels  appear'd to minister to  CHRIST  after his Temptation in the Wilderness and an  Angel  appear'  strengthening him in his Agony and Angels hav  appear'd on many other such eminent Occasions  but not except such Occasions were eminent an  that particularly so  But here you have an old Woman dead one tha  it may be has hid a little Money in the Orchard o  Garden and an Apparition is suppos'd comes an  discovers it by leading the Person it appears to to the Place and making some Signal that h  should dig there for somewhat or a Man is dead and having left a Legacy to such and such th  Executor does not pay it and an Apparition com  and haunts this Executor 'till he does Justice Is  likely an Angel should be sent from Heaven to fin  out the old Woman's e  then Dish with thirty o  forty Shillings in it or an Angel should be sent t  harrass this Man for a Legacy of perhaps five or ten Pounds and as to the  Devil  will any one charge  Satan  with being sollicitous to have Justice done they that know him at all must know him better than to think so hardly of him  WHO then must it be and from whence To say it is the Soul or Ghost of the departed Person and that he could not be at rest 'till the injur'd Person be Righted is advanc'd upon no Principle that is agreeable to the Christian Doctrine at all for if the Soul is happy is it reasonable to believe that the Felicity of Heaven can be interrupted by so trivial a Matter and on so slight an Occasion if the Soul be unhappy remember the great Gulph fix'd there is no room for us to believe that those miserable Souls have any Leisure or Liberty to come back upon Earth on an Errand of such a Nature  IN a word there is nothing but Difficulty in it on every side Apparitions there are we see no room to doubt the Reality of that Part but what who or from whence is a Difficulty which I see no way to extricate our selves from but by granting that there may be an appointed deputed sort of stationary Spirits in the invisible World who come upon these Occasions and appear among us which Inhabitants or Spirits you may call them Angels if you please Bodies they are not and cannot be neither had they been ever embodied but such as they are they have a Power of conversing among us and particularly with Spirits embodied and can by Dreams Impulses and strong Aversions move our Thoughts and give Hope raise Doubts sink our Souls today elevate them tomorrow and many ways operate upon our Passions and Affections may give Intimations of Good or Evil but cannot thro' some unknown Restraint upon their Power go any farther speak any plainer or give the least Assistance to us no not by Council or Direction to guide us or tell us how to act for our own Preservation  I AM told that these may be good  Angels  for all that and that it is no just way of arguing to say such things are too trifling to send an Angel from Heaven upon so mean an Errand and upon so inconsiderable an Affair since we see Providence daily giving Testimony not of its Government only but of its Care and Concern in and about the meanest Affairs of Life and that the Scripture it self frequently gives Examples of it in his feed  ng the Ravens taking care of the Sparrows clothing the Grass of the Field numbring the Hairs of our Head c So that Infinite is not limited or ty'd up to or from any degree of acting  Nor is there any thing great or any thing sma  l but as God is seen  n his least Creatures Insects Mites and the like so he is active in the most trifling Event Nor does that Providence who yet protects us in and delivers us from Danger always act  alike but as the Sovereignty of his Actings is no  to be disputed so neither is his Wisdom impeach'd by suff  ring Evil to fall upon Man which the least hint from his Light might have guided him to prevent  I THINK this is the utmost that can be said in the Case and yet it does not reach us at all  for this is not the meaning of my Objection n  nor is it the Substance of it I am not speaking o  Providence concerning it self in the Care of i  Crea  ures I acknowledge all that but then this Providence acts in its own Way and by its own invisible Operations nor is there any occasion for th  Agency of such extraordinary Instruments an  therefore it may be that Angels are never sent a  Expresses upon such Things  THE King or Government of a Nation may influence the whole Body of the People at whatever Distance by the Power of his Laws directin  the Magistrates and the Inferior Officers to act i  the Name of the Supreme and this is done without any Step out of the ordinary way of the Administration But if any extraordinary Occ  sion require then a Messenger is dispatch'd with particular Instructions and  pecial Power as the particular Case may require  SO Providence which is in a word the administration of Heaven's Government in the World acts in its ordinary Course and in the usual Way with an universal Influence upon all Things and nothing is below its Concern but when extraordinary Things present then the particular express Messengers from Heaven  viz  the Angels are sent with Instructions on that particular Affair which they are disp  tch'd about and no other And I may venture to say these are never sent upon Trifles never sent but on extraordinary Occasion  and to execute some special Commission and this comes directly to the Case in hand  IN the next Place I demand when cou'd it be said or what Example can be given where an Angel from Heaven has been sent to give any particular Person Notice of approaching Dangers and at the same time left the Mind unalarm'd and in a state of Indolence not capable of rouzing it self up to shun and avoid the Danger threaten'd or without Direction and Assistance to prevent or escape it this is what I alledge is unworthy of the Divine Wisdom and Goodness  LOOK into all the Messages or Notices that have been given from Heaven on such Occasio  s in all the Histories of the Scripture or almost  lsewhere and you will see the difference evidently Take a few for Example  TWO Angels are sent to  Sodom  not only to destroy the City for its Wickedness but to save  L  t  Well they come to him they tell him what they are about to do and that they are sent to do it  namely to burn the City This might have been enough and perhaps had it been notic'd to him by the Spirits I am speaking of this had been all and if  Lot  had not taken their kind Information it had been his own Fault nay as it was the Text says  Lot  linger'd and 'tis plain he left the City with a kind of Reluctance  BUT the kind Messengers do not satisfie themselves with giving him the Warning but they rouse up his Indolence See  Gen  xix  Hast thou any here  any that thou hast a Respect for or Interest in bring them out of this Place ver  We will destroy this Place  There's a hint of the Danger approaching and which is a wise Direction what to do but this does not satisfie the Man is not barely caution'd and directed but he is to be sav'd and therefore the beneficent Hand is not content to allarm and counsel him but ver  When the Morning arose they hasten'd  LOT they stirred up his unconcern'd Temper ARISE  lest thou be consum'd in the Iniquity of the City  and even this being not enough for LOT linger'd still and as I said seem'd loth to leave the Place they as it were dragg'd him out  ver  they laid hold of his Hand and upon the Hand of his Wife and upon the Hand of his two Daughters and brought him forth and set him without the City and what is the reason of all this the Words are express  the Lord being merciful to him  THE rest of the Story is well known when they had brought him forth they let him know he would not be safe even there but adds Escape for thy Life look not behind thee Nay he tells him whither he should go  ver  Escape to the Mountain lest thou be consum'd Here was a Message like a Work of Heaven here was the Warning of Danger and Directions to take proper Measures for Deliverance and those Measures pointed  out even to the very Place where he should be safe  TAKE another Place exactly like this  Matt  ii An Angel is sent to  Joseph  in a Dream to warn him of the Danger attending the Holy Infant then in the Virgin Mother's Arms the Words are express HEROD  will seek the young Child to destroy him  Does the blessed Notice leave  Joseph  to sleep on to say 'tis nothing but a Dream I don't see any Danger I believe there's nothing in it as is our Language often on such Occasions No no This Message was from Heaven who never gives such Notice of Evil and then leaves us unallarm'd undirected supine and easie 'till it falls upon us without Remedy the Angel adds presently ARISE and  take the young Child and his  Mother and  flee into  Aegypt and  be thou there 'till I bring thee Word  THUS you see the Nature of the Divine Proceedings the effectual manner of Notices from Heaven the Danger is told and then the Way to avoid it and always with a hasting Allarm Up get thee out of the City Arise flee into  Aegypt  and the like  ANOTHER is in the Story of  Peter  in the Prison an Angel is sent to deliver him  Acts  xii and what does the Angel do a Light shin'd in the Prison and he smote him on the Side this was to awaken and alarm him this and a Light to show him the Way was sufficient to have put him upon trying to escape But the Angel did not come so far to do his Work by Halves but having awak'd him he goes on with his Work and to perfect his Deliverance ARISE QUICKLY  Peter  and rais'd him up and then made th  Chains fall off from his Hands  NOR yet had he don    gird thy self  says the Angel and  bind on thy Sandals  or as we would say put on your Shoes still  Peter  was at a loss what to  do then the Angel adds  cast thy Garment about thee and follow me  Then he leads him through all the Wards and opens the Iron Gate for him and never left him 'till he had brought him out into the Street nay through one Street that the Keepers should not know which way to pursue him  THIS was an Appearance or Apparition to the Purpose and such have been all those Transactions of Heaven which have been under the Hands of express Messengers You see all these three were done by Angels sent on purpose  Peter  expresses it in so many Words Acts xii  Now I know of a surety that the  LORD  has sent his Angel and hath deliver'd me  NOW let us see how it has far'd with those who have receiv'd Notices of approaching Danger from the invisible World by the Hands of other Messengers  JULIUS CAESAR  had several Hints given him of his approaching Fate one particular Southsayer pointed out the very Day to him namely  the Ides of March  but he had no Power to avoid his Fate The kind Spirit that foreboded and gave hints to him that he was in Danger as if contented with having done his parr left him to be murther'd No Assistance given him to rouze up his Spirits to take the Alarm He is not led by the Hand and told  go not into the Senate House  as was done for  Lot escape for thy Life  The kind Monitor does not name the Traytors and Assassinators to him and say  Brutus  and  Cassius Casca  and others wait there to kill you as the Angel to  Joseph Herod will seek the young Child to destroy him  AND on the other side  Caesar  bold and unalarm'd indolent and having things not sufficiently explain'd to him and the good Spirit as may be suppos'd able to do no more for him goes on enters the Senate House mocks the Southsayer and tells him  the  Ides of March are come  who sharply return'd  But they are not past  In a word neglecting his own Safety and wanting a compleat Information he goes into the Senate and is murther'd  JULIAN  the Apostate is another Example He had a thousand ill Omens as they call'd them which attended him at and before his undertaking the  Persian  War such as the dying of the Consul  Julianus  of his own Name the burning of the Temple of  Apollo  and several other Accidents and tho' he was the most superstitious of all the Heathen Emperors that were before him and sent to all the Oracles to all the Augurs and Southsayers he could hear of insomuch that the Citizens of  Antioch  made a Jest of him for it Yet he was so blinded by his Flatterers or deluded by the Priests who construed the worst and most portentous things to mean the best Events or which is beyond it all by the superior Decree of an appointed Vengeance that he went on and was kill'd in the very beginning of the War the first Battel with the  Persians  carried him off  I MIGHT multiply Examples of the like kind even on both sides and especially on the last but 'tis sufficient our own Experience will confirm it secret Notices are daily given us of capital Dangers attending and yet how do the most vigilant Observers of those Signals and the most eminent OmenHunters even after those Notices sit still and grow indolent or else amaz'd and bewilder'd they say I know there's something a coming to me some Mischief attends me I have plain Notice of it but I don't know what it is I can't tell what to do I can do nothing to avoid or prevent it And thus they fall into the Pit as we may say with their Eyes open and in spight of the kind Spirit's beneficent Warning  WHAT can this be but because the Spirit tho' really kind and beneficent yet limited and impotent in Power was able to do no more than to give the Hint leaving the Person to his own Prudence to guard and direct himself  I MIGHT add here what 'tis rational enough to suggest  viz  that Heaven in its infinite Wisdom and Goodness may have appointed these Good Spirits to give such Notices yet allowing them to do no more that the Mind of Man being duly alarm'd at approaching Evil and believing something very fatal to him is at Hand but seeing no kind Being directing what M  thods to take for his Deliverance or for escaping the impending Mischief should turn his Eyes at least a little upwards and call for Direction and Council from that Hand who alone can both direct and deliver  BUT hold whither am I going This looks like Religion and we must not talk a Word of that if we expect to be agreeable Unhappy Times where to be serious is to be dull and grave and consequently to write without Spirit We must talk politely not religiously we may show the Scholar but must not show a Word of the Christian so we may quote prophane History but not sacred and a Story out of  Lucan  or  Plutarch Tully  or  Virgil  will go down but not a Word out of  Moses  or  Joshua  WELL we must comply however the Humour of the Day must prevail and as there is no instructing you without pleasing you and no pleasing you but in your own Way we must go on in that Way the Understanding must be refin'd by Allegory and Enigma you must see the Sun through the Cloud and relish Light by the help of Darkness the Taste must be rectify'd by Salts the Appetite whetted by Bitters in a word the Manners must be reform'd in Masquerade Devotion quicken'd  by the Stage not the Pulpit and Wit be brighten'd by Satyrs upon Sense  THIS Hypothesis of a new suppos'd Class of Spirits would lead me into a great many useful Speculations and I might remark with great Advantages from it upon the general Indolence which it is evident has so fatally possess'd ou  Men of Wit in this Age To see a Fool a Fop believe himself inspir'd a Fellow that washes his Hands fifty times aday but if he would be truly cleanly should have his Brains taken out and wash'd his Scull Trapan'd and plac'd with the hindside before that his Understanding which Nature plac'd by Mistake with the Bottom upward may be set right and his Memory plac'd in a right Position To this unscrew'd Engine talk of Spirits and of the invisible World and of his conversing with unembodied Soul when he has hardly Brains to converse with any thing but a Pack of Hounds and owes it only to his being a Fool that he does not converse with the  Devil  who if he has any Spirit about him it must be one of these indolent Angels I speak of and if he has not been listed among the Infernals it has not been for want of Wickedness but for want of Wit  I DON'T wonder such as these go a mobbing among those meanest of mad Things call'd  FreeMasons  rough Cheats and confess'd Delusions are the fittest things to amuse them They are like those foolish Fish that are caught in large Nets that might get out at every Square of the Mash but hang by the Gills upon the meer Thread and chuse to hamper and tangle themselves when there is no occasion for it and are taken even in those Snares that are not laid for them  CHAP V Of the Appearance of Departed Unembodied Soul  I NOW come to the main and most disputed Part of shadowy Appearance  viz  the Apparition of Unembodied Soul  IT is a material Difficulty here and ought to be consider'd with the utmost Plainness  viz  what we mean by  Unembodied Soul  whether we understand Souls which have been encas'd in Flesh but being unhous'd are now moving about in what State we know not and are to be spoken of as in their separate Capacity Or whether there is any such thing as a Mass of Soul as a learned but pretty much inconsistent W  iter calls it which waits to be embodied as the superior Disposer of that Affair be that who or what he pleases may direct  THIS I confess is to me something unintelligible looks a little  Platonick  and as if it were akin to the TransmigrationWhimsie of the Ancients but if they would found it upon any thing rational it must be upon the Suggestion mention'd above  viz  of a middle Class of Spirit neither AngelickHeavenly or AngelickInfernal But Spirits inhabiting the invisible Spaces and allow'd to act and appear here under express and greatly strain'd Limitations such as are already describ'd and of which much more may still be said  BUT that I may clear up your Doubt as to the Part I am upon I have added at the Head of this Section the Word  Departed  to intimate to you that I am Orthodox in my Notion that I am none of the Sect of SoulSleepers or for imprisoning  Souls in a  Limbus  of the Ancients but that in a few Words by the Appearance of Souls Unembodied I mean such as having been embodied or imprison'd in Flesh are discharg'd from that Confinement or as I call it unhous'd and turn'd out of Possession For I cannot agree that the Soul is in the Body as in a Prison but rather that like a rich Nobleman he is pleas'd to inhabit a fine Country Seat or Palace of his own Building where he resolves to live and enjoy himself and does so 'till by the Fate of things his fine Palace being overturn'd whether by an Earthquake or otherwise is bury'd in its own Ruins and the noble Owner turn'd out of Possession without a House  THIS Soul we are told and I concur in the Opinion has sometimes made a Tour back into this World whether Earth or the Atmo  phere of the Earth call it where you will and express it how you will it matters not much Whence it comes how far the Journey how and why it came hither and above all how it goes back again and what those various Apparitions are which counterfeit these Spirits enquire within and you shall know farther  THAT the Unembodied Souls of Men Dead as we say Departed have appeared we have affirm'd from the Authority of the Scripture which I must allow to be an authentick Document whatever the Reader may please to do 'till a History more authentick and of better Authority may be produc'd in the Room of it  AS to the Appearance of  Samuel  rais'd by the Witch I despise it as it is offer'd in the Capacity of a Soul much more as the Unembodied Soul of  Samuel  which tho' it might have been caus'd to appear as the Sovereign of all Spirits with whom the Soul of  Samuel  is at Rest had thought fit yet could no more be summon'd from that Rest by  the Conjuration of an old Witch than the  Devil  could fetch it out of Heaven by Force Nor was it likely that God who refus'd so much as to speak to that abandon'd Prince whom he had so righteously rejected and that would answer him neither by  Urim  or by  Thummim  that would neither hear his Prayer or accept his Offering would hear a Witch a Creature likewise sentenc'd to Death by his own righteous Law and send  Samuel  at her Infernal Pawwawing from Heaven to tell  Saul  that tomorrow he should be cut in Pieces by the  Philistines  there seems to be no Consistency at all in it no none at all  THE Appearance of the Thing call'd  Samuel  was in my Opinion neither more or less than a Phantasm or Spectre which as the  Devil  is allow'd to do might personate the old departed Prophet and who at the Witch's Summons and by Heaven's Permission came up to pronounce the dreadful Sentence upon  Saul  and let him see what was the Effect of his forsaking God and rejecting his Prophet  Samuel  And thus it might be allow'd also to speak in the first Person of the Prophet as it did nor do I say or think as some do that it was the  Devil  in  Samuel  's Likeness if it had 'tis not likely the old Woman would have been so frighted as to cry out seeing she was better acquainted with the  Devil  than to be surpriz'd if it had been her old Familiar  BUT she saw something she did not expect and perhaps had never seen before for she tells the King she saw Gods ascending out of the Earth by which I cannot but understand she saw some of those Spirits which I have mention'd which are not Infernal and who might foresee what the  Devil  himself cannot for I have no reason to believe that Satan knows any thing of Futurity  IF it be asked here by what Authority the Witch could bring up one even of these Spirits that indeed may be difficult to answer other than thus that it might be as  Balaam  was overrul'd to bless when he intended to curse and that at her Call and to pronounce the approaching Fate of  Saul  and  Israel  with him she might be overrul'd and so call'd up or call'd in a good Spirit instead of the  Devil  AS for the Spectre's speaking in the Name of  Samuel  in the Scripture and the Text representing it as if it were really  Samuel  himself Sam xxviii  And  Samuel  said to  Saul  why hast thou  isquieted me to bring me up  I take it to be an Expression  ad Hominem  to the common Understanding and to be understood as all Allegorick or Figurative Expressions are understood and it no more proves that it was  Samuel  and is no more to be taken litterally than the other Words in the same Verse are to be litterally understood    WHY hast thou disquieted me  as if it was in  Saul  's Power by the Conjurations of an abhorr'd condemn'd Limb of the  Devil  a proscrib'd Witch to disquiet the departed Soul of  Samuel  the Meaning is no more than this What is your Business with me what do you trouble me for You that despised me and acted contrary to all my Directions and would go on in your Perverseness in spite of me and of all I could say to you what do you come to me for now I am dead    TO bring me up  intimating that  Samuel  was below or was called  ab Inferis  which is contrary to Reason as well as Religion and neither consists either with our Notion or any body's else except it be the Soulsleepers who tell us the Soul sleeps with the Body in the Grave 'till the Resurrection and if so then must the old Woman have had Power to awake him whenever she pleas'd  UPON the whole it seems this Woman was a Witch of some Eminency and had more than ordinary Power in her way For when  Saul  applies to her she asks him Whom shall I bring up intimating that she was able to bring up who she would either from  Heaven  or  Hell  THIS Boldness plainly infers that she had no Power at all but this that being a Witch and one that had a Familiar Spirit she could cause her Familiar or Devil call it what we will to appear and personate who she pleas'd to name For why should not the  Devil  be as able to dress himself up like one dead Person as another and why not appear as well in the Shape of a dead Man as of a living One  SO that to me there is no more Difficulty in his Dressing himself like  Samuel  than there was in calling himself so or than speaking in the first Person of  Samuel  as above Why disquiet ME and why bring ME up All that seems inexplicable in it is how he should be able to tell  Saul  what should happen  viz  that GOD would deliver  Israel  into the Hands of the  Philistines  and him  Saul  with them and that tomorrow he should be with him that is among the Dead should be killed in the Battel This indeed has something difficult in it because the  Devil  is not allow'd to be a Prophet or able to predict what is to come But these things may be all answer'd by the Story of  Balaam  where the wicked Creature tho' a Wizard and a Conjurer yet was directed not only to bless  Israel  in spite of all the Gifts and Rewards that the King of  Moab  offer'd him but was enabled to prophesy of Christ and foretel the glorious appearing of the Messiah Numb xxiv  I shall see him but  not now  I shall bohold him but  not nigh  There shall come  a Star  out of  Jacob  and  a Scepter  shall arise out of  Israel and again  out of  JACOB  shall come he that shall have Dominion  This was a plain and direct Prophecy  of Christ who is call'd in the  Revelations  the MorningStar and yet this  Balaam  as a Witch a Dealer with an Evil Spirit and receiv'd the Wages of Unrighteousness  THE next Testimony which we find in  cred History of the Reality of Appa  iti  ns  s it r  cts the Souls of departed Persons is the Appearance of  Moses  and  Elias  with  Jesus Christ  in the Mount at his Transfiguration they not only were there really and personally in their Habits and so as to be known to the Disciples but they appear'd talking with Christ so that it was a Perfect and Compleat Apparition  viz  the particular Persons appearing and known by the Persons to whom they appear'd  Mat  xvii And in another Place the manner of the Apparition is describ'd as also what they talk'd of  Luke  ix  Who appeared in Glory and talk'd of his Decease which he should accomplish in  Jerusalem  THIS is so plain and unquestionable an Appearance of departed Souls that they who dispute it must not only doubt of the Divinity of Scripture but must dispute its being an authentick History which its Enemies will hardly deny  WE have yet another Testimony and this is as positive and express as the rest Matth xxvii  And the Graves were opened and many of the  BODIES  of the Saints which slept  AROSE  and came out of the Graves after his Resurrection and went into the holy City and appeared unto man  THIS is a remarkable Place and would admit of a long Exposition but I must not preach and if I might I am no Annotator as far as it is to my present Purpose  the Bodies arose  that was extraord  ary but that their Souls were als  h their Bodies is not to be douted at least by me for I have no Notion of the Body w  lking about without the Soul nor do we ever read of bodily Apparitions  AN Apparition is vulgarly call'd by us a Ghost by our Northern People a  Ghest  now the Ghost is a Spirit and the Apparition of a Spirit has some Sense in it the Spirits also assuming a Shape or Body whether Real or in Appearance only has something in it to be talk'd about but the Apparitions of Body moving appearing walking or whatever we may call it without Soul or Spirit is what was never heard of and scarce ever suggested  IT may be observ'd that those Apparitions quoted from the Scripture are not Apparitions in Vision Dreams in the Night or supposed Appearances only but plain open daylight Visions the former would not be to my purpose at all These were Apparitions that were spoken to and conversed with and this is a Proof of what I alledge  viz  that Spiri  s Unembodied may appear may reassume humane Shape their own former Likeness or any other and may show themselves to the World or to as many Persons as they please  THE Difficulties which attend this are not a few tho' none of them destroy the thing it self as Whether the Souls of good or bad People unembodied are really in a State or Condition for such an Appearance and whether it consists with the just Notions we ought to have of the unalterable State I mean such Notions as conform to the Scripture which if the Parable of the rich Man and  Lazarus  be a just Representation of it seems impossible to be except on such an extraordinary Occasion as that of our Saviour's Transfiguration and Resurrection that is by Miracle  LAZARUS  says the Text was upon his Death carried by the Angels into  Abraham  's Bosom the rich Man died and in Hell he lift up his Eyes That this is suppos'd to be immediately is evident because the rich Man speaks of his Brethren that were then alive If he was not carried thither immediately  he would certainly not have been carried there at all 'till after the Great  Audit  so that it was plain he was there presently after his Death and that  Lazarus  was carried immediately to Heaven is evident also because the rich Man is brought in seeing him there and desiring he may be sent to him  TO say this is but a Parable is to say what may be granted without Prejudice to the Point in hand For as it is a Parable it would not have been apposite if it had not represented things as they were really to be it would have been a Delusion and brought to deceive whereas it is a Parable of our Lord's own bringing and all those Parables that Christ uttered were the most perfect Representations and Illustrations of the things which they were brought to set forth nor is any one of them lame in their Allusions but instructive in every Article as the Parable of the Prodigal Son for Example and the Parable of the King making a Marriage for his Son and so of the rest And why must this alone be lame and unapt for the purpose  IF then this Parable is suited to represent the State of the Souls of the Departed those Souls then can no w  be concern'd in the Apparitions which we are speaking of except as is before excepted  viz  on such extraordinary Occasions as that of our Saviour  must be acknowledg'd to be  IF then neither the Souls or Spirits of the Blessed or the Cursed the Happy or Miserable the Sav'd or the Condemn'd are concern'd in those Appearances who then are these Inhabitants of the invisible World What are they that constitute and possess this World of Spirits so much talk'd of And if the immense Spac  s are taken up if they are peopled by any spirituous Creatures if any thing but Stars and Planets range through the  empty Place  as  Job  calls it  Job  xxvi what are  they and what are the Spirits that inhabit those Worlds  THERE must certainly be a World of Spirits or of Spirit from whence we receive the frequent Visits in Publick and the frequent Notices in Private which are so perceptible to us and which we are so uneasy about if they are neither good Spirits or bad if they have neither Power to do us Good or Hurt as I see a great d  al of Reason to believe then we have not so much Re  on to be terrified about them as we generally are but of that herea  ter  AS to the Locality of the  Devil  and his Appearance that indeed is another Ar  cl  and he may  as is said already  cov  r him  lf with what Shapes human or brut  h  pleases but then this would bring all Apparition to b by the Appearance of the  Devil  and all the Empire of the Air to be possess'd by him which I cannot grant Particularly because as I  aid some of these Apparitions come of good Errands to prevent Mischief to protect Innocence and Virtu  and to discover Injury Injustice and Oppr  ssion all which are things very much out of  e  Devil  's way remote from his Practice and much more remote from his Design The Spirits I speak of must be of a higher Original they must be Heavenborn of the glorious Original of angelick Species and as all things are known by their Consequences so they are known by their Actings they do Heaven's Work are under his immediate Government and Direction and are honour'd with his special Commission they are employed in his immediate Business namely the common Good of his Creature Man They that  do  Good demonstrate in the best manner that they  are  good  SO that every way we should meet with some Difficulty in this Case unless solv'd as I said before  by the denominating another Class of Spirits neither immediately celestial or at all infernal neither embodied or that have been embodied or that shall ever be embodied  IT cannot be expected I should describe what these are and in what Condition it is sufficient that I only say Such may be there and that they may be such as he thinks good to place there who made that empty Place I may as well ask the Enquirer what sort of Inhabitants they are who possess the Moon or any of the Planets and whether they dwell in a State of Innocence or have contracted Guilt and if the latter whether there is a glorious Establishment of Redemption and a Covenant of Life granted for them as there is here by the Purchace and Merit of a Saviour  IT is no fair Question to ask me a Demonstration for an  Hypothesis  or is it reasonable to tell me they will not believe it because I cannot prove the Affirmative of what I do not affirm I advance the Probability and say that it is the more Probable because as they say of the new Philosophy by this we can solve several other  Phoenomena  which we cannot otherwise account for and I alledge it is much more probable and more rational to suggest it than it is that the Planets should be inhabited for which 'tis certain that God must have created a new Sp  cies of Creatures or that none can dwell there  THE Waste or the empty Space  as  ob  it  is full of Spirits I believe that may be t  ke  for granted they are placed there  if they  by the powerful Hand of the Creator the  is no Philosophy can be pleaded against the Place being habitable whereas the Objections against the Planets being habitable are unanswerable but by th  Absurdity of bringing Almighty Power in to  several new Species of Creatures some to liv  Fire some in Frost some in all Darkness and Ice some in boiling Waters and scalding Air  THE Inhabitants which I suggest are created for the Regions of the invisible World are Spirits invisible Substances Bodies without Body such as are proper for the Expanse in which they live and eligible for us to conceive of and tho' we cannot grasp a Spirit with our Hands feel it and see it yet we can in some manner conceive of it But for the planetary Inhabitants we cannot account for them to our selves or any one else nor can we conceive any thing of them that we can say is probable or rational  IS it at all irrational to suppose or improbable to be that God may have made a Degree of Angels or of ministring Spirits whether they are angelick or of other Species is not for us to determine who may be of a differing Degree appointed for a differing Residence and to different Employments from the superior Angels for a Season  AS there are different Degrees of Glory in Heaven Stars of different Magnitude and Lustre in the Firmament so may there not be Angels or Spirits of differing Quality and Degrees of Power and Favour why else are they called  Thrones and Dominions Principalities and Powers  they are all Titles of Honour given to the Angels in the Scripture  Eph  i and vi If there be several Titles there must be several Degrees  THERE can be no Superior if there are no Inferior what can we understand by Thrones and Principalities in Heaven but Degrees of Angels Besides what do we understand by  Angels  and  ArchAngels    Thess  iv  shall descend with the Voice of an ArchAngel  and again  Jude  ver  Michael the ArchAngel  IF there are Angels which are not ArchAngels but of an inferior Degree so there may be also different Degrees among the Angels which are not ArchAngels and some of these may be appointed their Residence in the Air or Atmosphere of this World Earth or within the Compass of this particular Solar System for I allow there may be several like Systems    THUS those that will suppose these Appearances to be of none but Angels I shall not contend at all with them I exclude no Species of Spirits but the departed unembodied Souls of Men I have allowed Apparitions to the  Devil  himself upon his own wicked and proper Occasions I only cannot grant that because God can therefore he does employ him upon his own gracious and beneficent Orders to his Creature This must at least seem to bring Providence to a Necessity of employing him for want of other Officers which I think is highly detracting and dishonouring of the divine Majesty as if he was oblig'd to employ the  Devil  as we say for want of a Better  BUT excluding Satan I think God does not want Agents he has apparently posted an Army of ministring Spirits call them Angels if you will or what else you please I say posted them round this  Convex  this Globe the Earth to be ready at all Events to execute his Orders and to do his Will reserving still to himself to send express Messengers of a superior Rank on extraordinary Occasions  I MAKE no question but these are the Angels which carried away  Lazarus  into  Abraham  's Bosom I mean which are supposed to do so  I DOUBT not these are the Angels of which Christ says his Father if he had pray'd would have sent him  more than  twelve Legions for his Guard  TO say it is not to be expected God sh  uld cause such an Host of glorious Spirits to attend on  this little Point the Earth and this despicable Species called Man would be but to oblige me to say What may not God be supposed to do for that Creature whom he  so lov'd  as to send his only begotten Son to redeem So at least that Question is fully answer'd  NOW these Spirits let th  m be what they will and call them Angels if you please I conceive these are they whose Appearances give us so much Difficulty to solve These may without any Absurdity b  supposed capable of assuming Shape conversing with Mankind either in the ordinary or extraordinary Way ei  her by Voice and Sound tho' in Appearan  e  a  d  orrow'd Shapes or by private Notices of things Impulses Forebodings Misgivings an  ot  r  mperceptible Communications to the Minds of Men as God their great Employer may direct  NOR are these Notions of them at all absurd or inconceivable tho' the Manner how they act may not be understood by us 'Tis but Soul conversing with Soul Spirit communicating to Spirit one intellectual Being to another and by secret Conveyances such as Souls converse by  NEITHER is the Apparition of these Spirits any Absurdity these may be intimate with us appear to us be concerned about us without any thing unintelligible in it Why may not one Spirit be so as well as another and one Kind or Species of Spirits as well as another  IF these are innocent goodmeaning and bene  cent Spirits why may it not consist with the Wisdom and Goodness of God to suffer such to be conversant with Men and to have Acce  s to the Spirits embodied as well as to allow the  Devil  and evil Spirits to converse so among us to our Hurt  BUT let me give one Caution here and enter my Protest against the Power or Pretences to the Power of raising or as 'tis call'd bringing up these  Spirits To call them and summon them up for Intelligence of human Affairs and this by Magick and Conjurations which we vulgarly and justly enough call the  Black Art  I cannot allow this Part of Science to have any Influence upon or Command over any good Spirit But that as the  Witch  of  Endor  obtain'd of the  Devil  to personate the old Prophet  Samuel  and appear in his Shape speak in his Name and act the Prophet in Masquerade so these  Men of Art  may bring the  Devil  to mimick a good Spirit call himself an Inhabitant of the World of Spirits and so delude Mankind as he does in almost every thing he says to them But he cannot really call up one of these independent free Spirits who are perfectly out of his reach whereever they are and whose angelick Nature places them above not under him or at his Command  SATAN is a conquer'd subdu'd Enemy and these indeed were his Conquerors and are still his Terror He abhors them and hates them and flees before them And what if I should say they were placed in this Situation namely in the invisible Regions near and about this World for this very Reason  viz  to keep under this ArchEnemy and Rebel as a conquering Prince having obtained a glorious Victory over a powerful Rebel tho' he retires from the Country with his Troops the War being over yet leaves a good Body of Forces to keep the Peace of the Country and to awe the Rebels from any farther Attempt  THUS they are Guardian Angels really and in the very Let  er of it without being oblig'd to attend at every particular Man's Ear or Elbow Mankind are thus truly said to be in the Hands of God always and Providence which constantly works by Means and Instruments has the Government of the World actually in his Administration not only by his infinite Power but by immediate  Deputation and the subdued  Devil  is a Prisoner of War both chain'd and restrain'd  CHAP VI Of the Manner How the Spirits of every Kind which can or do appear among us manage their Appearance and How they proceed  THE Possibility being thus settled and it being granted that Spirits or detach'd Angels do converse with Mankind visibly as well as invisibly and have Access to us to our Souls as well as Bodies as well by secret Communication as by open and publick Apparition it remains to enquire into the Manner how this Conversation is carried on  I HAVE already entred my Protest against all those Arts call'd Magical and Diabolic by which Man is made capable at least of being Aggressor in this Communication that he can call up these Spirits or call 'em down rather and begin the Conversation when he pleases  WHETHER by Compact and secret Hellish Familiarity with the  Devil  he may not obtain Leave to use Satan with such Freedom I will not determine I doubt he may for the  Devil  may depute such and such Powers and Privileges to his Confederates as to his Honour in his great Wisdom shall seem meet But that he can empower them to do the like with those good and beneficent Spirits of the invisible World who are I have suppos'd Spirits not  Devils  that I deny nor do I see any Reason to grant it  I COME then to the Manner the Spirits which I would suppose may inhabit the utmost Waste are able to correspond with us and first as Spirits  or Angels call them as you will they are to be supposed like other Spirits to have an extensive Knowledge and a View of all created Substances at least on this side Heaven a vast capacious Understanding an unbounded Sight a Liberty of Locomo  ion passing from one Region to another from one Planet to another they are not congeal'd by Cold or calcin'd by Heat that they are able to exist in all Climates even from  Saturn  to  Mercury  that they may go and come appear and disappear here or where else they please in a word that they are free Agents as well in their Motions as Actings Hence they are necessarily to be supposed to know all things needful to he known relating to us as well as to other things that they can take Cognizance of human Affairs and that not by Grant or License or by second hand Information from Hell from the infernal Spirit or any other Place but by their own angelick and spirituous Penetration and that they have no Dependance upon Satan or any Power or Person concern'd with him that they act also as Spirit on all Occasions  THO' we see nothing of them they see us tho' we know nothing of them they know and are conversant about us are capable of being affected and moved in our Behalf and to concern themselves for our Good on many Accounts Hence they often give us Notices and Warnings of Evils attending us tho' they cannot act so upon material Objects as to interfere with our Affairs overrule our Fate or direct us how to avoid the Evils which they foresee or to embrace the Good which they see attending us of which and the Reasons of it I have spoken already  AS they can thus communicate things to our Imagination so we may suppose that in Prosecution of that beneficent Concern which they have  for us they can and frequently do assume human Shape and come to us talk to us and converse intimately with us in Apparition and by Voice nay even in Dialogue Question and Answer a  they see Occasion  THIS conversing in Apparition is what we call  Walking  and when any such thing is seen we say a Spirit  walks  or  haunts  such a Place and tho' this is a mighty terrible thing in the vulgar Appearance and the People when these things appear to them are apt to say they see the  Devil  yet it i  very often a Mistake and a very wide Mistake as appears by the Consequence  I HAVE heard of a Man who travell'd four Years thro' most of the Northern Countries of  Europe  with the  Devil  if all those Spectres or Apparitions are  Devils  which I must not grant nor was this Spectre so insincere as to conceal it self all  he while from him but discover'd to him that he was but an Apparition without Body Substance or any thing but Shape  IF the Account I have of this Apparition be true and I have had it by me many Years he did him Good and not Hurt he guided him thro' Desarts and over Mountains over frozen Lakes and little Seas cover'd with Snow he diverted him with Discourses of various Subjects always issuing for his Good and for the Encrease of Knowledge He went with him over the Sea from  Ireland  to the Coast of  Norway  He procur'd Winds for him without buying them of Witches and  Laplanders  He did not raise Storms for him because being a Traveller and upon a Voyage he had no Occasion of them but he foretold Storms punctually and exactly prevented the Ship's putting out to Sea when Storms were approaching found the Ship's Boat and Anchors when the first was driven away in the Night and the second weigh'd and run away  with by the  Norwegians  in the Dark the Ship having been obliged to slip and run up into Harbour I say he found them that is to say directed the Seamen where to find them and to discover the Thieves  HE did a thousand things for him and for his Accommodation in his Travels he was acquainted whereever he came and procured his FellowTraveller Entertainment and good Usage he knew the Affairs of every Country and the very People too he spoke every Language  German Norse  or  Norway Polish Prussian Russian Hungarian Tartarian  and  Turkish  HE past Rivers without Bridges tho' he would never let his FellowTraveller see him do tha  or help him to do it nor would he let him see him mount into the Air upon any occasion whatever but would set him in his Way give him very faithful Directions how to find the Places he was going to and then strike off some other Way as if he had Business at this or that Place and would not fail to meet him again punctually at the place he appointed  SOMETIMES he would be seen at a distance a Mile or more today on his right tomorrow on his left Hand and keeping even pace with him come into the same Village or Town where he lodg'd and take up as it were at another Inn but if he enquir'd for him in the Morning he was always gone and the People knew nothing of him except that they just saw such a Man the Evening before but that he did not stay  WHEN he had travelled thus with him from  Ireland  as I said to the Coast of  Norway  where they were driven in by Storm and after that by Sea round the said Coast of  Norway  to  Gottenburgh  where they put in again by contrary Winds he persuaded the Traveller not to go any farther in that Ship  THE Traveller being Bound with the Vessel to  Dantzick  and having a considerable Quantity of Goods on Board would by no means be prevail'd with to quit the Ship His FellowTraveller told him he had the Secondsight and that he was assur'd the Ship should never come to  Dantzick  However the Traveller not giving so much Credit to him as that requir'd and not knowing any thing of him at that time but that he was a strange intelligent foreseeing Man as he call'd him would continue the Voyage whereupon the Stranger left him and the Ship pursuing the Voyage was surpriz'd with another dangerous Storm I say another because they had had one before In this Tempest the Ship was driven upon the Coast of  Rugen  an Island on the  German  side of the  Baltic  where with much Difficulty they put into  Straelsund  a SeaPort of  Pomeren  and there the Traveller went on Shore  HERE walking pensively and concern'd about the event of his Fortune and fearing the Ship would really be lost as his first Man had foretold him I say walking very anxious upon the Key at  Straelsund  there meets him a Man who he was utterly a Stranger to but who salutes him in  English  calls him by his Name and asks him what he did there  SURPRIZ'D with such a Salutation and glad to see any Man in such a strange remote Country that he was like to be acquainted with and much more that could call him by his Name he return'd his Compliment and answer'd that indeed he had not much Business there but that he came thither by a very unfortunate occasion  I KNOW you are says the Gentleman you came in here last Night in yon Ship pointing to the Vessel which lay in the Road betwen the City and the Island of  Rugen  I DID so  says the Traveller  and I am like to have but ill Luck with her  I DOUBT so  says the Stranger  and I suppose that made you look so much concern'd  I CANNOT deny  said he  but I might look troubled I think I have Cause for I am here in a strange Country without Acquaintance or Interest and know not yet what Condition the Ship is in or my Goods which I doubt are damag'd  I AM assur'd  says the Gentleman  the Ship will not be able to pursue her Voyage but perhaps your Cargo may be safe I understand the Goods you have on Board are Herrings  THEY are so  says the Traveller  I have twelve Last of Herrings on board and we have had a long Voyage already  I KNOW you have  said the Gentleman  but pull up your Spirits your Fish is all safe and you may get it on Shore and you shall either sell it here or get Ships here to Reload it again for  Dantzick  and seeing you are a Stranger adds he I will get you some assistance  ALL this while he had not ask'd him his Name but now he said to him Will you not let me know Sir who it is I am thus much oblig'd to  FIRST returns he let me see and get you some help that you may go cheerfully about your Business and we'll talk of that afterwards so he bad him walk a little there and he would come to him again  HE had not walked long but he sees a Messenger coming to him to tell him that there was an  English  Gentleman desir'd to speak with him at such a House and that he was to guide him to the place  ACCORDINGLY he follows the Messenger who brings him to a Publick House where were Three Gentlemen sitting in a Room and the Man he had conversed with made a fourth who call'd him in and bad him sit down which he did  THE Three Gentlemen saluted him very kindly and one of them also in  English  and told him they had receiv'd an Account of his Circumstances from  hat G  ntleman and that they sent for him to comfort and assist him  THIS was a kind and agreeable Surprize to him and he could not but receive it with all Civility and Acknowledgment possible After which they ask'd him to Sup with them which he accepted of and at Supper hearing the whole of the Case they sent for a Merchant of that City to come to them  WHEN the Merchant was come they recommended the Stranger's Affair to him and he the Merchant was so assistant to the Stranger that he bo  ght all his Cargo of Fish or procur'd others to buy it giving him a Price to his Satis  ction and gave him as much Money there as he requir'd and good Bills payable at  Dantzick  for the rest  IN the mean time  or this was transacting several Days the Three Gentlemen continued exceeding courteous and obliging to him and after many other Civilities they being travelling into  Poland  invited the Traveller to go with them as far as  Dantzick  which they knew he was bound for and that they would subsist him at their own Charge so far The Traveller considering his own Condition and that the Ship he came in was not in Condition to pursue the Voyage resolv'd to accept of the Offer and accordingly prepar'd to go with them But he was extremely concern'd that he could not see the kind Stranger who had first saluted him as above and who brought him to th  Gentlemen that were now so extraordinary civil to him he enquir'd after him of the Messenger that fetch'd him to that House but he knew him not he ask'd the People of the House but they could give no A  count of him he ask'd the three  Gentlemen about him but they knew nothing of him the  English  Gentleman among them said he thought he belong'd to that Gentleman pointing to another of the three who was a  German  the  German  answer'd that he understood he was the third Gentleman's Friend who was a  Swede  that is a  Pomeranian  for  Pomeren  is under the Dominion of the  Swedes  But the  Swede  said he thought he was the  English  Gentleman's Brother for he spoke  English  very well in a word no body knew him and he saw him no more  IN a Week more or thereabout the four Gentlemen for now they were so many set out together with every one a Servant except our Traveller who had none Every one that knows the Country from  Stetin  to  Dantzick  and  Poland  knows that it is a desart and wild Country very thin of Inhabitants and consequently not full of Towns with several Woods and Wasts in their Way very difficult to Travel and this oblig'd them several times to take Guides by the Way so that they made up with their Guides always Eight sometimes Ten in Company very well arm'd and tolerably well mounted  THE third Day after they were past the  Oder  and began to come out of that Part of  Pomeren  which lies East of  Stetin  and is call'd the  Ducal Pomeren  they observ'd a Man mean in Apparel but appearing something more than meerly what Poverty represents travelling the same Way as they did but always keeping at about the distance of half a Mile from them on their left Hand  HE travelled on Foot but kept full pace with them and often was some way before them whether he was in a Track or Road as they were they could not tell but he kept such an equal Distance as if the Road he was in was Parallel with theirs indeed sometimes they lost sight of him for a while  yet they were sure to find him again at some little distance either before them or behind them and this continued three Days before they took any extraordinary notice of him  BUT the third Day they were a little more curious about him and one of them with a Servant attending rode from the Company intending to speak with him but as soon as he saw them come towards him the Stranger fled farther to the Left from them still however keeping on his Way forward but plainly shunning being spoken with so the Gentleman and his Servant came back again having made no Discovery except this that the Stranger kept no Path or Track that there wa  no Road or Way in the Place where he marcht bu  that he only kept at such a certain distance from them from whence they concluded that he was only some poor Man that was travelling ove  that wild Country and having gotten some Intelligence of their Journey kept pace with them to guide him the Way But two Things amuse  them strangely that Third Day of their Travel  THEY observed that Riding over a large Plain where there were some few scattering House  which lay on the other side of the Road South for he kept all along before on the North side o  them I say passing over this Plain the Travelle  keeping a little behind them cross'd the Road and going up to one of the said scatter'd Houses knock'd at the Door and went in  UPON this they resolv'd if possible to get some knowledge of him so th  y rode all up to another of those Houses Here calling to the Inhabitants tho' it was no Inn or House of Entertainment but a Poor Husbandman's Cottage they got Leave to refresh themselves having Provisions and Wine of their own and giving the good Wife a  mall Bottle of about half a Pint of Brandy at part  ng the People were abundantly satisfied  HERE talking of the Traveller and at what House he call'd in the Village for tho' the Houses stood stragling over the waste yet as there were near twenty of them in all it was call'd a Town here I say talking of the Traveller and of his knocking at the Door of one of the Houses the Woman of the House understanding their Language hastily ask'd What says she have you seen the  Owke Mouraski  Who she meant they did not know but describing  he Person to her and she also to them they began to come to an Understanding Did he not keep Pace with you  says she  on the North side of the Road all the Way Yes said they  AY  says she  and had you offer'd to ride towards  m you would always have found him as far off as  first  THAT amused them Why what is he  says one  f the Gentlemen  NAY we know not  says she  nor desire to  now  WHY so  says he  BECAUSE  says she  he brings no good luck pray at what House do ye say he knockt at the Door  THEY describ'd the House at which the Woman and all the Children fell a crying and making  great sign of Sorrow  WHAT'S the Matter  says the Gentlemen  what  re you disturb'd at  O'  says the good Woman  that  Owke Mouraski  never calls at any House in the Town but some or other of the Family dies that Year  BY this it seem'd that he came often that Way  o he ask'd the Woman how often he was used to  e seen thereabouts  SHE answered Not often perhaps once or twic  a Year and  says she  sometimes he passes by an  calls or knocks at no House in his Way and the  adds she  we are glad to see him  WHY  says the Gentleman  what do you ta  him to be the  Devil  NO no  says she  not the  Devil  no he is a ver  good Man  BUT why are you so afraid of him then  says  BECAUSE  says she  he knows more than  the Men in the World he knows if any o  is to die and then he knocks at the House to  them to be ready  N B  Here the Woman enquired more exac  about the House where the Traveller called a  the Gentleman going to the Door pointed it  to her at which she left off crying and th  rejoyc'd as much as she had lamented before  it seems she had mistaken it for another Ho  which stood near it and where her own Fath  and Mother lived  THEN he asked her what Countryman the Tr  veller was  SHE said they did not know that for no Bo  ever spoke to him they were afraid  WHY  says he  when he knocks at the Doo  don't ye speak to him  NO  says she  nor does he speak a word but ju  as he goes away he will sometimes sayre…peating a word which I do not remember b  signifies  be comforted  and then they are sure th  Person shall be sick only but shall not die  BUT  says he  do they entertain him or give hi  any thing  YES  says she  they set Bread before him an  he takes a small Piece in his Hand but no Bod  can say they ever saw him Eat  BUT what do you take him to be then  says he  A GOOD Angel says the Woman adding ano  er hard Word of their own signifying that he  id no Hurt to any body and says she to some Families he is a Messenger of Good All this gave them Amusement but no particular Satisfaction and rather prompted their Curiosity to make farther En  uiry about him After about an Hour's refreshing themselves at this poor Cottage they proceeded on their Journey and having rode about two Miles they saw their old Object again on the left or north  ide of their Road as before and he kept in their sight in the same manner all the rest of the Day  THERE was a Town I think 'tis call'd  Kintzigen  or some such like Name at a few Miles distance and where their Guide told them they should lodge and before they came to the Town there was a River not a great or very wide River but too large to ride thro' it and at the Town there is a ve  y good stone Bridge built as they were told by  he Ancestors of the Kings of  Prussia  that is as I suppose the old Dukes of  Pomerania  ACCORDINGLY they pass'd this Bridge and  hen went into the Town It was most natural to them to observe what Course the Traveller would take to pass the River who as he went on must necessarily come to the Bank at near a Mile distance from the Town so they halted a little one of them alighting from his Horse as if something had required their stay that the Traveller might go on before them which he did  OBSERVING him as narrowly as possible they follow'd him with their Eyes down to the very Edge of the River nor did he stop or take notice of them tho' they saw him plainly to the very Bank but here not being able to keep him exactly in their sight every Moment they immediately saw him going up the rising Grounds on the other side  without being capable of giving the least accou  how he pass'd the Water  THIS was the other Passage which I say am  sed them very much  AS soon as they came into the Town where the  were to lodge their Guide looking beyond th  House where they stop'd called to them Lo  yonder says he is your Traveller sitting at th  Door of such an Inn or House pointing to th  Place and there they saw him plain at the Door  ting a piece of Bread and having a Pot or Jug  Polish  Beer standing by him One of the Gentleme  resolving if possible to speak with him walk'd up  his Boots to the Place seeing him sitting all the wh  he was going 'till coming very near and happe  ing to turn his Eyes but one Moment from hi  when he look'd again the Man was gone  HE ask'd the People of the House about hi  but they knew nothing of him only that as th  said there was such a Man but he was gone  they neither knew who he was or whither he w  gone  THEN he ask'd them if they did not know th  Owke Mouraski  they said Yes they had heard  but they did not know him  WHY  says the Gentleman  don't you know th  this was he that sat upon the Bench  NO  they said  that could not be he that was  poor Countryman a Traveller  THE Gentleman assured them that was he  which they seemed very much concerned but seeme  very willing not to believe him  WHY  says he  are you afraid of him  NO  says they  but we don't like his coming t  us for they say he brings no good to the Fami  where he comes  BUT this Discourse ended and the Gentlema  gain'd no Information there  THE next Day they had his Company again as before and passing by a single House upon the Road near a Village but standing quite out of the Road they observ'd the Traveller to stop at that House and go in  BY this time their Curiosity was very much heighten'd and they began to be something uneasy about him it was not very pleasant they thought to have the Devil so near them and they could think him to be nothing less so they all turn'd back and resolv'd to go to the House and if he was there to speak with him if possible and if not to inform themselves as much as they could about him  WHEN they came within about a quarter of a Mile of the House they saw the Traveller on the other side having gone out at the back Door and travelling forward as unconcern'd and taking no notice of them just as before  THIS surprized them however they went up to the House and enquired about him as they did before but here they receiv'd a quite differing Account of him here the People bless'd him called him by the same Name but took him for their good Angel as they call'd him that he always brought them good Tidings that they were sure it would fare well with them after he had been with them and a great deal more  BUT to bring this Story to a conclusion so far as it serves the present Occasion This Spectre or Apparition for so I must call it attended them 'till they came within two Leagues of  Dantzick  where the Gentlemen separated after a Day or two staying in the City the three Gentlemen going from thence to  Mariemburgh  in  Polish Prussia  and our Traveller was left in  Dantzick  WHILE he was here a Man made acquaintance  ith him who was bound to  Koningsberg  and our Traveller bein  resolv'd to go for  Petersburg  was  glad to have this new Acquaintance which he had as we may say pick'd up to go with him so they embark'd together in a small Hoy upon the Sea or Lake call'd the  Frischaff  which carry'd them to  Koningsberg  He gives a strange tho' diverting Account of his Conversation with this Man who told him so many Stories of several kinds that it amaz'd him and he look'd as if he knew all the World and all the People in it and all things that had happened in it or would happen in it for ever to come and something longer  HOWEVER as the  Frischaff  is not above three or four Days sail and they were quickly at  Koningsberg  the Conversation was soon over and this new Acquaintance ended but the Traveller continuing his Journey enquired in the City if there were any Passengers or Gentleman travelling towards  Riga  either by Land or by Sea and being directed to a House where Strangers used to resort he found there several People bound for  Riga  some Merchants some CountryPeople some SeafaringPeople but most enclin'd to go by Sea there being Vessels always ready at the  Pillan  which is a Town at the Mouth of the  Haff  ready to Sail for  Riga  if Goods or Passengers presented  BUT among them all there was an ancient Man habited like a  Russ  or rather like a  Greek  Priest with a long venerable Beard a purple Robe or long Garment such as the  Russians  wear a high stiffcrown'd Furrcap and a close Vest about his Body girded with a Silk Sash and he declar'd himself for  Riga  but that being an old Man he would not go by Sea but that he had two Horses in the City besides his own having brought two Servants with him from  Grodno  in  Lithuania  but one of them had left him so he offer'd the Traveller to lend him one of his Horses for his Company if he would  travel with him to  Mittan  in  Courland  and thence to  Riga  IT will take up too much Room here to give a full Account of the Travels of this wandring Person and how in almost every Place he found a new Shape ready to thrust into his Company and that for four Years intimate Ramble but that at last being in  Turkey  his latest Companion discover'd to him that he was an Inhabitant of an invisible Region that he had been in his Company in all his Journey in all the differing Figures that he had met with and that in a Word he was the same Person that embark'd with him in  Ireland  landed with him in  Norway  left him at  Gottenburg  found him at  Straelsund  dogged him upon the way to  Dantzick  sailed with him to  Koningsberg  lent him a Horse to go to  Riga  and so on and that he had only put on so many Shapes and Appearances that he might not be uneasy with him and tired of his Company  HOW they went on together after that and the Conversation that pass'd between them after the Discovery how familiar Friends they were for some Months after and what Reasons he gave why he would never believe that it was a Devil but a good and kind Spirit sent to take Care of him and assist him in his Travels all that as foreign to my present Purpose I omit Perhaps the Story may see the World by itself and well worth reading it will be if it does But of that by the by  AS I do not here enter into the Authority of the Story tho' as I said I have seen it in Manuscript many Years ago so I have no more to say from it than this that if such good Spirits are conversant with Mankind and resident in the invisible Spaces we know not where if we have reason to believe they are not Angels and yet really by their Actions cannot be Devils then it follows that there are a  certain middle Species of Spirits in Being let them be what they will let them be employ'd directed limited and restrain'd how and in what manner he pleases who is their Maker and who ought to be their Guide and Director that's not the matter nor can it be enquired into here the Question before us is only whether such there are or no  NOW if it be granted that there are such and that brings it down to the present Case if there are such then all Apparitions are not Devils no nor are they walking disturbed Souls of Men lately embodied and departed a Notion empty and not to be defended incongruous and inconsistent either with Scripture the Christian Religion or Reason and founded only in the bewildred Imaginations and Dreams of ignorant People who neither know how or by what Rules to judge of such Things or are capable of right Conceptions about them who do not give themselves time to ex  rcise that little Power of thinking that they are Masters of and so are left to the Darkness of their own Fancies thinking every thing they see is a Devil meerly because they know not what else to make of it what other Name to give it or that it can be possible any thing but Devils or Ang  ls can come of such Errands  BY this Mistake they give the Devil the Honour of many an Action which he is too much a Devil to have any hand in ascribe Works of Charity and Benevolence to him make him move injurious and knavish Men to do Justice Thieves to make Restitution cruel and inhuman Wretches to be merciful Cheats to turn honest Robbers to desist and Sinners to repent  STORY tells us that  Hind  that famous outlaw'd Robber the most famous since  Robin Hood  met a Spectre upon the Road in a Place called  StangateHole  in  Hunti  gtonshire  where he used to commit  his Robberies and famous for many a Highway Robbery since that  THE Spectre appeared in the Habit of a plain Country Grazier and as the Devil you may suppose knew very well the Haunts and Retreats that this  Hind  used to frequent he comes into the Inn and taking up his Quarters puts up his Horse and makes the Hostler carry up his Portmanteau which was very heavy into his Chamber when he was in the Chamber he opens his Pack takes out his Money which seemed to be in several small Parcels and puts it together into no more than two Bags that it might make an equal weight to each side of his Horse and make as much show of it as possible  HOUSES that entertain Rogues are seldom without Spies to give them due Intelligence  Hind  gets Notice of the Money sees the Man sees the Horse that he may know him again finds out which Way the Countryman travels meets him at  StangateHole  just in the bottom between the two Hills and stops him telling him he must deliver his Money  WHEN he nam'd the Money the Grazier feigns himself surprized puts on the Pannick trembles and is frighted and with a pitiful Tone says  I am  as you see  but a poor Man indeed Sir I have no Money  there the Devil shew'd that he could speak Truth when it serv'd his Occasion O you  old Dog  says he have you no Money Come open your Cloakbag and give me the two Bags one on one side your Saddle and one on t' other what have you no Money and yet your Bags were too heavy to lie all on one side Come come deliver or I'll cut you to Pieces this Moment There he was out too and threatened more than he cou'd do Well the poor Devil whines and cries and tells him he must be mistaken he took him for another Man sure for indeed he had no Money  COME come says  Hind  come along with me and so he takes his Horse by the Bridle and leads him out of the Road into the Woods which are very thick there on both sides and the business was too long to stand in the open Road all the while to do it  WHEN he had gotten into the Woods Come Mr Grazier says he dismount and give me the two Bags this Minute In short he dismounts the poor Man cuts his Bridle and his Girts and opens his Cloakbag where he finds the two Bags  Very well  says  Hind  here they are and heavy as before so he throws them on the Ground cuts them open in one he finds a  Halter  and in the other a piece of solid Brass in the exact shape of a Gibbet and the Countryman behind him call'd to him  There's your Fate  HIND  take care  IF he was surprized at what he had found in the Bags for there was not a Farthing of Money but in the Bag where the Halter was of which presently I say if he was surprized at what he found in the Bags he was more so at hearing the Countryman call him by his Name and turn'd about to kill him because he thought he was known but he had no Life nor Soul left in him when turning about as I say to kill the Fellow he saw nothing but the poor Horse He sunk down to the Earth and lay there a considerable time how long that being alone he could not tell but it must be some Minutes At last coming to himself he goes away terrified to the last degree and ashamed wondring what it should be  I HINTED that there was no Money but one Piece found which the Story says was  Scots  a Piece call'd in  Scotland a Fourteen  in  English a Thirteen Pence HalfPenny  to pay the Hangman with from whence it may be suppos'd that Saying is used to this  Day  that Thirteen Pence HalfPenny is Hangman's Wages  NOW tho' the Story has some Mirth in it and may with the many Stories of that Robber be laid by as Romances yet it is thus far to my Purpose That this was a Spirit that must be acknowledg'd A good Angel from Heaven wou'd hardly have been sent to give him such an ineffectual insignificant Hint which had no sufficient Effect whatever it might have just then to surprize him for he rob'd continually after that and was hang'd at last for it  THE  Devil  as before cannot rationally be suspected in the Case for why should the  Devil  both bauk him threaten and caution him threaten him with hanging him fright him with the Gibbet and Haltar and caution him to take care This was not for the  Devil  's Purpose it was more for his Interest to have him go on though he came to the Gallows at last  IF then it was neither  good  Angel or  Bad  what must it be and how must we judge of it what Name must we give him and who was this Country Graz  er  TO come off of this some will have it be that it is the  Devil  under Constraint the  Devil  in Commission that he is sent on such Errands by a superior Power that has him at Command and that when he is directed to do  so  and  so  he must obey he dare do no otherwise This is begging the Question in the grossest manner imaginable Besides why the  Devil  sent of such Errands  IT  is not probable  it is not to be gather'd from the ordinary Course of Providence The  Devil  indeed was permitted or if you will have it he was commission'd to strip and afflict Poor  Job  and he was again permitted to enter into the Herd of Swine but this does not amount to a Paralel In  both those Examples he was only employ'd as an Instrument and as we may express it in his ordinary Business in the way of his Calling that is to say in doing Mischief But here he is suppos'd employ'd in doing Good cautioning a harden'd Rogue to leave off his wicked Course and escape the Gallows Now this is quite out of  Satan  's road of Business 'tis also out of the ordinary course of Heaven's Conduct for when do we find God employing the  Devil  in any good Work I do not remember one clear Example of it in all the sacred History  IT would argue that Heaven should want Instruments which is not at all just to infer will they pretend that for want of more proper Agents God should employ the  Devil  to save a Highway Man from the Ga  lows and which is more than all the rest should not bring it to pass neither But if you will allow that this was one of the Imaginary species of Spirits who willing to save a poor Wretch that was running head long to the  Devil  took all these Measures to alarm him and bring him to just Reflections but was not able to reclaim him was not admitted to give him Notice when he was about the fatal Act he was surpriz'd in or to warn him when the Officers came to apprehend him this seems rational  IF the  Devil  should be suppos'd to be employ'd in such a Work as this was and so contrary to his Inclination either he would perform it like himself treacherous and unfaithful or at best reluctant and unwilling Perhaps you will say he durst not perform it treacherously and unfaithfully and it may be not But why must it be suppos'd Heaven should employ his wor  t and wickedest Creature whom he had long since disbanded and cast out of his Service rejecting him as unworthy to be employ'd and who if he was employ'd and durst  not decline the Work yet it must be acknowledg'd would obey with the utmost  version and Unwillingness when at the same time Millions of faithful Agents willing and chearfullyobed  ent Servants are ready at command  to execute his Will with the utmost Vigour and Fidelity  BUT to leave arguing upon Inscrutables let us come to Narration of Facts  I HAVE another Account received from a particular Acq  aintance in a neighbouring Nation I could name Persons and Places in a more exact manner to these Accounts but some Reasons of State forbid us at this time to enter into the Circumstances of Families For where Matters of Apparition and Witchcraft are the Substance of the Histor  it has never been found reasonable to name Hou  s and Families and as this Apology will be all  w'd to be just I expect it will be accepted by the R  ader in all the Examples I shall give of this kind  A CERTAIN Person of Quality being with his Family at his CountrySeat for the SummerSeason according to his ordinary Custom was ob  g  d up  n a par  icular Occas  on of Health to leave his said Seat and go to  Aix La Chapplle  to u  e the Baths there This was it seems in the Month of  August  being two Months sooner than the usual time of his returning to Court for the Winter  UPON thus removing sooner than ordinar  he did not then di  furnish the Ho  se as was the ordinary Usage of the Family or carry away his Plate and other valuable Goods but left his Steward and three Servants to look after the House and the  Padre  or  Parish Priest  was desired to keep his Eye upon them too and to succour them from the Village adjoining if there was Occasion  THE Steward had no publick Notice of any Harm appro  ching but for three or four Days successively  he had secret strange Impulses of Dread and Terror upon his Mind that the House was beset and was to be assaulted by a Troop of Banditti or as we call them here  Housebreakers  who would murther them all and after they had robb'd the House would set it on Fire and this follow'd him so fast and made such Impression upon his Mind that he could think of nothing else  UPON this the third Day he went to the  Padre  or  Parish Priest  and made his Complaint upon which the Priest and the Steward had the following Discourse the Steward beginning thus  FATHER said he  you know what a Charge I have in my Custody and how my Lord has intrusted me with the whole House and all the rich Furniture is standing I am in great Perplexity about it and come to you for your Advice  Pa  WHY what's the Matter you have not heard of any Mischief threatned have you  St  NO I have heard of nothing but I have such Apprehensions and it has made such Impression upon me for these three Days that  Here he told him the particulars of the Uneasiness he had been in and added besides what is said above that one of the Servants had the same and had told him of it tho' he had communicated nothing to that Servant in the least    Pa  IT may be you dream'd of these things  St  NO indeed  Padre  I am sure I could not dream of them for I could never sleep  Pa  WHAT can I do for you What would you have me do  St  I WOULD have you first of all tell me what you think of these things and whether there is any Notice to be taken of them  Here the  Padre  examin'd him more strictly about the Particulars and sent for the Servant and examin'd him apart and being a very judicious honest Man he answer'd him thus    Pa  LOOK you Mr  Steward  I do not lay a very great Stress upon such things but yet I don't think they are to be wholly slighted and therefore I would have you be upon your Guard and if you have the least Alarm let me know  St  THAT is poor Satisfaction to me to be upon my Guard if I am overpower'd I suppose if any Villains have a Design to attack me they know my Strength  Pa  SHALL I reinforce your Garrison  St  I WISH you would  Pa  WELL I'll send you some Men with FireArms to lye there this Night  ACCORDINGLY the Priest sent him five stout Fellows with Fuzees and a dozen of HandGranadoes with them and while they continu'd in the House nothing appear'd but the  Padre  finding nothing come of it and being loth to put his Patron to so continued a Charge sent for the Steward and in a chiding angry Tone told him his Mind  Pa  I KNOW not how you will answer it to my Lord but you have put him to a prodigious Expence here in keeping a Garrison in the House all this while  St  I AM sorry for it  Padre  but what can I do  Pa  DO Why compose your Mind and keep up your Heart and don't let my Lord spend two or three hundred  Livres  here to cure you of the Vapours  St  WHY you said your self  Padre  that it was not to be wholly slighted  Pa  THAT'S true but I said also I would not lay too great a Stress upon it  St  WHAT must I do then  Pa  DO Why dismiss the Men again and take what Care you can and if you have any Notice of Mischief that may be depended upon let me have Notice too and I'll assist you  St  WELL then the good Angel must protect my Lord's House I see for no body else will  Amen  says the  Padre  I trust the good Spirits will keep you all So he bless'd the Steward in his way and the Steward went away grumbling very much that he took away his Garrison and left him to the good Spirits  IT seems for all this that the Steward's Notices however secret and from he knew not who wer  not of so light an Import as the  Padre  though  they were for as he had this Impulse upon hi  Mind that such Mischief was brewing so it reall  was as you will see presently  A SET of Robbers who had Intelligence th  the Nobleman with his Family was gone to  A  La Chapelle  but that the House was left furnish'  and all the Plate and the things of Value were le  in it had form'd a Design to plunder the Hous  and afterwards to burn it just as the S  eward h  said  THEY were two and twenty strong in the whol  and thoroughly arm'd for Mischief Yet while th  additional Force which the  Padre  had plac'd t  reinforce the Steward were in the House o  whom including the other four three sat up eve  Night they did not dare to attempt it  BUT as soon as they heard that the Guard w  dismiss'd they form'd their Design anew and  make the Story short they attack'd the House  …bout Midnight Having I suppose proper I  struments about them they soon broke open a Wi  …dow and twelve of them got into the Hou  the rest standing Centinel at such Places as th  thought proper to prevent any Succours from t  Town  THE poor Steward and his three Men were  great Distress they were indeed above Stairs a  had barricadoed the StairCases as well as th  could hearing the Fellows were breaking in but when they found they were got in they expected nothing but to be kept above Stairs 'till the House was plunder'd and then to be burnt alive  BUT it seems the good Spirits the Priest spoke of or some body else made better Provision for them as you will see presently  WHEN the first of the Fellows were gotten in  o the House and had open'd the Door and let in as many of their Gang as they thought fit which as above was twelve in Number they shut the Door  gain and shut themselves in leaving two without the Door who had a Watchword to go and call more Help if they wanted it  THE twelve ranging over the great Hall found  ittle there to gratify their greedy Hopes but brea  ing next into a fine wellfurnish'd Parlour where  he Family usually sat Behold in a great easy Chair sat a grave ancient Man with a long full  ottom'd black Wig a rich brocaded Gown and Lawyer's lac'd Band but looking as if in great  urprize seem'd to make Signs to them for Mercy  ut said not a Word nor they much to him ex  ept that one of them starting cry'd HA  who's  ere  IMMEDIATELY the Rogues fell to pulling  own the fine Damask Curtains in the Windows  nd other rich Things but One said to Another  ith an Oath Make the old Dog tell us where the  late is hid and another said  if he won't tell you  ut his Throat immediately  THE ancient Gentleman with Signs of En  eaty as if begging for his Life and in a great  right points to a Door which being open'd  ould let them into another Parlour which was  he GamingRoom and serv'd as a DrawingRoom  o the first Parlour and by another Door open'd  to the great  Salon  which look'd into the Gardens  They were some time forcing their way into that Room but when they came in they were surpriz'd to see the same old Man in the same Dress and the same Chair sitting at the upper end of the Room making the same Gestures and silent Entreaties as before  THEY were not much concern'd at first but thought he had come in by another Door and began to swear at him for putting them to the Trouble of breaking open the Door when there was another way into the Room But another wickeder than the first said with a heavy Curse  the old Dog was got in by another Door  on purpose to convey away the Plate and Money and bad knock his Brains out Upon which the first swore at him that if he did not immediately show them where i  was he was a dead Dog that Moment  UPON this furious Usage he points to the Doo  which opened into the  Salon  which being a thi  Pair of FoldingDoors open'd presently and i  they run into the great  Salon  when looking at th  farther end of the Room there sat the ancien  Man again in the same Dress and Posture as before  UPON this Sight those that were foremos  among them cry'd out aloud Why this old Fellow deals with the  Devil  sure he's here afore u  again  BUT the Case differ'd a little now for whe  they came out of the first Parlour being eager fo  the Plate and Money and willing to find it ALL  the whole Body of them run out into the secon  Parlour but now the ancient Man pointing to th  third Room they did not all immediately rush ou  into the  Salon  but four of them were left behin  in the Parlour or GamingRoom mention'd jus  now not by order or design but accidentally  BY this Means they fell into the following Confusion for while some of them call'd out from the  Salon  that the  old Rogue was there before them again  others answer'd out of the Parlour How the  Devil  can that be why he is here still in his Chair and all his Rubbish with that two of them run back into the first Parlour and there they saw him aga  sitting as before Notwithstanding all this far from guessing what the Occasion should be they fancied they were gamed or suggested that they were but jested with and that there were three several old Men all dress'd up in the same Habits for the very same Occasion and to mock them as if to let them know that the Men above in the House were not afraid of them  WELL  says one of the Gang  I'll dispatch one of the old Rogues I'll teach one of them how to make Game at us upon which raising his Fuzee as high as his Arm would let him he struck at the antient Man as he thought it was with all his Force but behold there was nothing in the Chair and his Fuzee flew into a thousand Pieces wounding his Hand most grievously and a Piece of the Barrel striking him on the Head broke his Face and knock'd him down backward  AT the same time one of those in the  Salon  running at the antient Man that sat there swore he would tear his fine brocaded Gown off and then he would cut his Throat but when he went to take hold of him there was nothing in the Chair  THIS happening in both Rooms they were all in most horrible Confusion and cry'd out in both Rooms at the same Moment in a terrible manner  AS they were in the utmost Amazement at the thing so after the first Clamour they stood looking upon one another for some time without speaking a Word more but at length one said Let's go back into the first Parlour and see if that's gone  too and with that Word two or three that were on that side run into the Room and there sat the antient Figure as at first upon which they called to the Company and told them they believed they were all bewitch'd and 'twas certain they only fancy'd they saw a Man in the other Rooms for there was the real old Man sitting where he was at first  UPON this they all run thither saying they would see whether it was the  Devil  or no and one of them said Let me come I'll speak to him 'tis not the first time I have talk'd with the  Devil  NAY  says another  so will I and then added with an Oath Gentlemen that were upon such Business as they were ought not to be afraid to speak to the  Devil  A THIRD for now their Courage began to rise again  calls aloud  Let it be the  Devil  or the  Devil  's Grandmother I'll parley with it I am resolv'd I'll know what it is and with that he runs forward before the rest and crossing himself says to the antient Man in the Chair  in the Name of St  Francis  and St  and so reckon'd up two or three Saints Names that he depended were enough to fright the  Devil What art thou  THE Figure never mov'd or spoke but looking at its Face they presently found that instead of his pitiful Looks and seeming to beg for his Life as he did before he was chang'd into the most horrible Monster that ever was seen and such as I cannot describe and that instead of his Hands held up to them to cry for Mercy there were two large fiery Daggers not flaming but red hot and pointed with a livid bluish Flame and in a word the  Devil  or something else in the most frightful Shape that can be imagin'd And it was my Opinion when I first read the Story the Rogues were so frighted that their Imagination afterwards form'd a thing in their Thoughts more terrible than the  Devil  himself could appear in  BUT be that as it will his Figure was such that when they came up to him not a Man of them had Courage to look in his Face much less talk to him and he that was so bold and thus came arm'd with half a Regiment of Saints in his Mouth fell down flat on the Ground having fainted away as they call it with the Fright  THE Steward and his three Men were all this while above stairs in the utmost Concern at the Danger they were in and expecting every Moment the Rogues would strive to force their Way up and cut their Throats They heard the confus'd Noise that the Fellows made below but cou'd not imagine what it was and much less the Meaning of it but while it lasted it came into the Mind of one of the Servants that as it was certain the Fellows were all in the Parlour and very busy there whatever it was about he might go up to the Top of the House and throw one of their HandGranadoes down the Chimney and perhaps it might do some Execution among them  THE Steward approved of this Design only with this Addition if we throw down but into one Parlour they will all fly into the Gamingroom and so it will do no Execution but says he take three and put down one into each Chimney for the Funnels go up all together and then they will not know which Way to run  WITH these Orders two of the Men who very well knew the Place went up and firing the Fuzees of the Granadoes they put one Shell into each of the Funnels and down they went roaring in the Chimney with a terrible Noise and which was more than all the rest they came down into the Parlour where almost all the Rogues were just at the Moment that the Fellow that spoke to the Spectre was frighted into a swooning Fit and fallen on the Floor  THE whole Gang was frighted beyond Expression some run back into the gaming Parlour whence they came and some run to the other Door which they came in at from the Hall but all at the same Instant heard the  Devil  as they thought it was coming down the Chimney  HAD it been possible that the Fuzees of the Granadoes could have continued burning in the Funnel of the Chimnies where the Sound was a thousand times doubled by the hollow of the Place and where the Soot burning fell down in Flakes of Fire the Rogues had been frighted out of their Understandings imagining that as they had one dreadful  Devil  just among them in the Chair so there were ten thousand more coming down the Chimney to destroy them all and perhaps to carry them all away  BUT that could not be so after they had been sufficiently scared with the Noise down came the Shells into the Rooms all three together It happen'd as luckily as if it had been contriv'd on purpose that the Shell which came down into the Parlour where they all were burst as soon as ever it came to the Bottom so that it did not give them time o much as to think what it might be much less to know that it was really a HandGranadoe but as it did great Execution among them so they as certainly believ'd it was the  Devil  as they believed the Spectre in the Chair was the  Devil  THE Noise of the bursting of the Shell was so sudden and so unexpected that it confounded them and the Mischief was also terrible the Man that fainted and who lay on the Ground was killed outright and two more that stood just before the Chimney five of them were desperately wounded whereof one had both his Legs broke and was so desp  rate that when the People from the Country  came in he shot himself thro' the Head with his own Pistol to prevent his being taken  HAD the rest of them fled out of the Parlour into the two other Rooms 'tis probable they had been wounded by the other Shells but as they heard the Noise in both the outer Rooms and besides were under the Surprise of its being not a HandGranado but the  Devil  they had no Power to stir nor if they had could they know which way to go to be safe so they stood stock still 'till both the Shells in the other Rooms burst also at which being confounded as well with the Noise as with the Smoke and expecting more  Devils  down the Chimney where they stood they run out all that Way and made to the Door helping their wounded Men along as well as they could whereof one died in the Fields after they were got away  IT must be observ'd when they were thus alarmed with they knew not what coming down the Chimney they cryed out that the  Devil  in the Chair had sent for more  Devils  to destroy them and 'twas suppos'd that had the Shells never come down they would all have run away But certain it was that the artificial  Devil  joyning so critically as to Time with the visionary  Devils  or whatever they were compleated their Disorder and forced them to fly  WHEN they came to the Door to the two Men they made signals for their Comrades who were posted in the Avenues to the House to come to their Relief who accordingly came up and assisted to carry off their Wounded Men but after hearing the Relation of those that had been in the House and calling a short Council a little way from the Door which tho' dark as it was the Steward and his Men could perceive from the Window they all resolved to make off  THERE was another concurring Accident which tho' it does not relate to my Subject I must set down to compleat the Story  viz  That two of these Granadoes by the Fire of their Fuzes set the Chimneys on Fire the third being in a Funnel that had no Soot in it the Room having not been so much used did not This Fire flaming out at the top as is usual was seen by some Body in the Village who run immediately and allarmed the Priest or  P  d    and h  again rais'd the whole Town believing there was some  hief fallen out and that the House was set on Fir    HAD the rest of the Gang not  solv'd to make off as is said above they had certain  fallen into the Hands of the Townsmen who ran immediately with what Arms came next to Hand to the House But the Rogues were fled leaving as above three of their Company dead in the House and one in the Field  I MUST confess I cannot draw many Inferences to my purpose from the Particulars of this Story which however I have told for your Diversion but from the General I may namely This Apparition was certainly not in favour of the Robbery and if all the Particulars are true in Fact as related we can hardly with Justice place them to Satan's Account Take him as a Destroyer and a Father of Mischief he could not be suppos'd to have appear'd to prevent the Robbing the House or to assist the Steward in the House in defence of his Master's Goods what Good Spirit this must be and from whence is then a remaining Question and that brings it to my purpose again  I SHALL give you another Story out of more Authentick Records tho' related in a different manner by several People as their several Interests inclin'd them  JAMES  IV King of  Scotland  being perswaded by the Clergy  and the Bishops to break with  England  and declare War against  Henry  VIII contrary to the Advice of his Nobility and Gentry who were to bear both the Expence and the Blows of a Battel  I say  the King thus overruled by the Clergy raises an Army and prepared to march to the Frontiers but the Evening before he was to take the Field as he was at  Vespers  in the Chappel Royal at his Palace of  Lithgo  or  Linlithgow  an antient Man appear'd to him with a long Head of Hair of the Colour of Amber some Accounts would represent it as a Glory painted round a Head by the Limners and of a venerable Aspect having on a rustick Dress that is to say in that Country Language a belted Plaid girded round with a Linnen Sash This Man was as it seems by the Story perceived by the King before he came close up to him and before he was seen by any of the People and the King also perceiv'd him to be earnestly looking at him and at the Noble Persons about him as if desiring to speak to him  AFTER some little time he press'd thro' the Crowd and came close up to the King and without any Bow or Reverence made to his Person told him with a low Voice but such as the King could hear very distinctly That he was sent to him to warn him not to proceed in the War which he had undertaken at the Sollicitation of the Priests and in Favour of the  French  and that if he did go on with it he should not prosper He added al  o that he should abstain from his Lewd and Unchristian Practices with wicked Women for that if he did not it would issue in his D  struction  HAVING deliver'd his Message he immediately vanish'd for tho' his pressing up to the King had put the whole Assembly in disorder and that every one's Eye was fix'd upon him while he was delivering  his Message to the King yet not one could see him any more or perceive his going back from the King which put them all into the utmost Consternation  THE King himself also was in great Confusion he would fain have believ'd the Spectre was a Man and would have spoken to it again and would have ask'd some Questions of him But the People constantly and with one Voice affirm'd that it was an Angel and that it immediately disappear  d after the Message was deliver'd that they plainly saw him and felt him thrusting to get by them as he went up but not one could see him go back  THE King upon this was satisfied that 'twas not a real Body but an Apparition and it put him into a great Consternation and caused him to delay his March awhile and call several Councils of his Nobility to consider what to do  BUT the King being still overperswaded by those Engines who were employ'd by Monsieur LA MOTTE the  French  Ambassador continu'd in his Designs for a War and advanc'd afterwards with his Army to the  Tweed  which was in those times the usual Boundary of the two Kingdoms  HERE the Army rested some time and the King being at  Jedburgh  a known Town in those Parts as he was sitting drinking Wine very plentifully in a great Hall of the House where his HeadQuarters was then held suppos'd to be the old Earl of  Morton  's House in that Town the Spectre came to him a second time tho' not in the Form which it appear'd in at  Lithgo  but with less regard or respect to the Prince and in an imperious Tone told him he was commanded to warn him not to proceed in that War which if he did he should lose not the Battel only but his Crown and Kingdom and that after this without staying for any Answer like the Hand to King  Ahasuerus  it went to the Chimney  and wrote in the Stone over it or that which we call the Mantlepiece the following Distich  Laeta sit illa dies Nescitur Origo secundi  Sit labor an requies sic transit gloria Mundi  THAT the King did not listen to either of these Notices our Histories as well as  Buchanan  the Historian of  Scotland  take Notice of very publickly and that he marcht on fought the  English  at  FloddenField  and there lost his Army all his former Glory and his Life is also recorded I need say no more of it  THESE two Apparitions were certainly from such Spirits as we are speaking of  viz  such as mean well to Mankind and being Good and Beneficent in their Nature would prevent the ruin or destruction of those whom they appear to But have not always Power to direct the Measures or to oblige the Persons to hearken to their Advice  HAD it been a Heavenly Vision 'tis more than probable it would have laid hold of the King's Hand as the Apparition of Angels did to  Lot  and as it were dragg'd him away and said You shall not go forward that you may not be d  eated and slain both you and your Army  AGAIN had it been the  Devil  or an Apparition from Hell the Message would never have been for Good it would never have warn'd him to avoid the Battel which should be so fatal to him and in which so much Innocent Blood should be shed to gratify the Priests who 'twas not doubted were brib'd or otherwise influenc'd by  France  and by which the King should be sure to lose his Life  THE  Devil  is too great a lover of Mischief to concern himself in such an eminent manner for a Publick Good too great an Enemy to Mankind to take the Trouble to caution the King twice and  send as we may say two Expresses to him to save his Life and prevent a War nor can we suppose the  Devil  concern'd to promote Peace in the World but just the contrary 'tis his business to Foment Distractions publick Confusions and War  BUT should we suppose for once that the  Devil  stand  ng Neuter between the two Nations should go so far out of his way as to endeavour to keep the Peace for that time only yet what shall we say to the other Part of the Message at  Lithgo viz  That he should abstain from his Lewdness and from his scandalous Life his familiarity with Women and the like Did ever the  Devil  pretend to this in his Life if this cou'd be the  Devil  then he must be allow'd to act very much out of his ordinary Way as some express it 'tis not his profess'd avow'd Practice  WHAT then must these Appearances be and from whence And how reasonable is it from all these things to believe that there are some other Spirits which we yet know nothing of or but very little who do so far concern themselves for the good of Mankind as that they frequently appear to us to warn us of Danger to alarm us at the Approach of Impending Mischief advising and cautioning us from evil Courses and evil Actions as what is destructive to our present as well as future Felicity  IF it be Objected that some have owned themselves to be the Souls of departed Persons as of near Relations Wives Husbands c and have appear'd in their Likness and even in their Cloaths it is answer'd That is no Argument against the thing at all because as Spirits are allow'd in our present Discourse to assume any Shape so it is not doubted but they may take up the Shape of the Dead as well as of the Living and may assume the  very Cloaths Countenances and even Voices of dead Persons and it must be so or else we must fall into all the absurdities of Souls remaining in a wandring unappointed unsettled state after Life which if it should be granted we must in many things contradict the Scripture and the receiv'd Opinions of all the reform'd Churches and almost of all good Men even in all Ages  CHAP VII Of the many strange Inconveniences and ill Consequences which would attend us in this World if the Souls of Men and Women unembodyed and departed w  re at Liberty to visit the Earth from whence they had been dismiss'd and to concern themselves about Human Affairs either such as had been their own or that were belonging to other People  I BELIEVE there are few speculative Delusions more universally receiv'd than this  that those things we call  Spectres Ghosts  and  Apparitions  are really the departed Souls of those Persons who they are said to represent  WE see or pretend to see our very Friends and Relations actually cloath'd with their old Bodies tho' we know those Bodies to be embowell'd s  parated and rotting in the Grave as c  rtainly as the Head and Quarters of a Man  xecuted for Treason are drying in the Sun upon the Gates of the City we see them dress'd up in the very Cloaths which we have cut to pieces and given away some to one body some to another or appli  d to this or that use so  that we can give an Account of every Rag of them we hear them speaking with the same Voice and Sound tho' the Organ which form'd their former Speech we are sure is perished and gone  THESE Similitudes of things fix it upon our Thoughts that it must be the same that the Souls of our late Friends are actually come to revisit us which is to me I confess the most incongruous and unlikeliest thing in the World  FIRST  They must have a very mean Opinion of the future State and the exalted Condition of the Blessed that can imagine they are to be interrupted in their Joy and even  disquieted  as  Samuel  said to  Saul  by the importunities of this World's Affairs  Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up  as if it was in the Power of a despicable Witch to bring him up for it intimates a Force whether he would or not which does not at all correspond with the high Thoughts we are directed to entertain of the perfect Felicity of that State of which Eye has not seen or Ear heard or Heart conceived  SECONDLY  They must have likewise very mean Thoughts of the State of everlasting Misery who can think that the Spirits in Prison can get loose from those determined Chains to come hither and attend upon the Trifles of Life nor do I know whether it would be worth their shifting Hell and coming back to this World in the wandring Condition those Things call'd Ghosts are understood to be or indeed to reassume a Body without making Life a State of farther Probation For what would Life be here for a few Years subjected to human Infirmity want distress and casualty and no alteration possible of their future State no Hope no room for changing the Sentence They know little of that Hell call'd Despair that can think it more supportable in this World than the Eternal State which it is a prospect of is in that to come  BUT this is too grave abundance for the Times  and therefore I say no more of that Part but I must bring the Case nearer to our present Taste as well as to our Capacity  LET us next enquire into the Necessity of disturbing or disquieting our departed Friends with or about the Concerns of their Families If their coming is by the Permission of Providence then I demand what Occasion is there for it and of what Service is it seeing the same Providence is able to employ other Servants of the same Errand and to do the same Business and who will not only do it as well but to be sure much better It is answer'd the Sovereignty of Providence is not to be disputed He may do what he pleases and employ who he pleases but then the Wisdom of Providence too is not known to act inconsistent with itself and which is a sufficient Answer to all the rest we are allowed to judge of all these things by our reasoning Powers nor have we any other Rules to judge by and it can be no Crime to reason with calmness and with due respect to superior Power upon the ordinary Administration even of Heaven itself  I'LL suppose that no Apparitions were allow'd to shew themselves on Earth but on Occasions of some unusual Consequence and that then they might always be expected and there are many affirm it to be so tho' I openly say I do not but suppose it I say and that whenever these things have appear'd it was in especial Cases such as of manifestly injur'd Right Oppression of Widows and Orphans Wrong done to Persons unable to do themselves Justice depress'd Poverty and many such Cases which Souls are said to be anxious about even after Death I say if it were so the World is at this time and perhaps has always been so full of Violence Injustice  Fraud and Oppression that the Souls of our depa  ted Friends would hardly ever be at rest  HOW many weeping Widows starving Orphans and oppress'd Families have in our Age suffer'd by the loss of the Money which their Fathers and other Ancestors left for their Subsistance and Establishment in a certain City Chamber or put into a certain Exchequer upon the publick Faith According to this Notion neither the visible or invisible World would have been at Peace the habited visible World would have been continually haunted with Ghosts and we should never have been quiet for the Disturbance of Spirits and Apparitions the invisible World would have been in a continued Hurry and Uneasiness Spirits and Unembodied Souls asking leave to go back again to see their Wills rightly perform'd and to harrass their Executors for injuring their Orphans and all the Ages of Time would have been taken up in giving Satisfaction to them in such and such Cases  IT was the Saying of a  Roman  indeed I mean a  Roman  in Religion that it was a Sign to him past all Dispute that the Dead could never come to the Quick because the Testators of all those Chatities given by departed Souls of Saints for the Maintenance of Hospitals Chantries Colleges Churches and religious Houses as well in Money as in Lands and Inheritances did not walk and haunt King  Hen  VIII and pull him not out of his Throne only but out of his Grave for taking away as he did all those Rents and Revenues Lands and Estates from the religious Houses to which they belong'd  NOW if they were not disquieted for so great a Piece of Injustice why should they be forcibly disturb'd for Trifl  s compar'd to those great Events  AGAIN should departed Souls get leave to come back to this World to see Justice done to their Famili  s  and Relations how comes it to pass that they have not done it on such frequent Occasions as are daily given them in the World And why do any People enjoy peaceably the Estates which they got wrongfully The Works of Heaven are all perfect Would he have sent Angels or Spirits to procure Justice to be done only in Part and not in the Whole And how much Arrears is the wicked Part of the World then in to the better Part And which way is it possible Right should now be done  BESIDES to go back to publick Things what Rage what Violences Rapins Ruins not of Persons only but of Nations have we seen and heard of in the World and yet we see Death puts an End to all Grievance or Complaints of Grievance whatsoever the departed Souls rest undisturb'd about it Resentment all dies with them and whatever the Apparitions which we call Souls have pretended or we have pretended for them the Souls themselves are perfectly unconcern'd at it all  WHAT Apparitions have been have certainly been of those blessed Angelick Spirits who may so far have concern'd themselves in some Cases of Violence Oppression manifest and atrocious Frauds to allarm the Offenders and thereby bring them to do Right as well for their own good as for the Relief of the oppress'd Sufferers who perhaps have invok'd the Divine Justice against them  HENCE give me leave to observe tho' it is still a little serious and perhaps you may think it is out of the way that 'tis not a thing of the least Concern to us to have the Cry of the Poor against us or to have the Widows and Orphans who we have injur'd and oppress'd look up to Heaven for Relief against us when they perhaps have not Money to go to Law or to obtain or seek Remedy against us in the ordinary way of Justice I had much ra  her have an unjust Enemy draw his Sword upon  me than an injur'd poor Widow cry to Heaven for Justice against me and I think I should have much more Reason to be afraid of the Last than the First the Effect is most likely to be fatal  Job  xxxiv and  Exod  xxii  Ye shall not afflict any Widow or Fatherless Child If thou afflict them in any wise and they cry at all unto me I will surely hear their Cry  and  v    And your Wives shall be Widows and your Children Fatherless  But this is a Digression and of a kind I shall not fall often into  BUT as much as I think there is Reason to apprehend the Prayers of the oppress'd Widow and Orphan or of any injur'd FellowCreatures yet I must acknowledge I see no Reason to be afraid of their Ghosts or of their Souls visiting me in order to terrifie me into a Change of the evil Practice and a humour or resolve of doing Right to their Families  CONSCIENCE indeed is a frightful Apparition itself and I make no Question but it oftentimes haunts an oppressing Criminal into Restitution and is a Ghost to him sleeping or waking nor is it the least Testimony of an invisible World that there is such a Drummer as that in the Soul that can beat an  llarm when he pleases and so loud as no other Noise can drown it no Musick quiet it or make it hush no Power silence it no Mirth allay it no Bribe corrupt it  CONSCIENCE raises many a  Devil  that all the Magick in the World can't  lay  it shows us many an Apparition that no other Eyes can see and sets Spectr  s before us with which the  Devil  has no Acquaintance Conscience makes Ghosts walk and departed Souls appear when the Souls themselves know nothing of it  THIS thing called Conscience is a strange bold Disturber it works upon the Imagination with an  invincible Force like Faith it makes a Man view things that are not as if they were feel things that are not to be felt see things that are not to be seen and hear things that are not to be heard it commands the Senses nay even the Tongue it self which is so little under Command submits to this sovereign Mandate and tho' I do not see that Conscience always overrules it to Silence yet it often makes it speak even whether it would or no and that to its own Ruin and Destruction making the guilty Man accuse himself and confess what his Policy had before so effectually conceal'd that no Eye had seen it no Evidence could prove it  THE Murtherer sees the murther'd Innocent as plainly before his Eyes as if he was actually sent back from his Place to charge him  nay  he sees him without Eyes he is present with him sleeping and waking he sees him when he is not to be seen and testifies to his own Guilt with no need of other Witness  I HAVE heard a Story which I believe to be true of a certain Man who was brought to the Bar of Justice on Suspicion of Murther which however he knew it was not in the Power of human Knowledge to detect When he came to hold up his Hand at the Bar he pleaded  Not Guilty  and the Court began to be at a Loss for a Proof nothing but Suspicion and Circumstances appearing however such Witnesses as they had they examin'd as usual the Witness st  nding up as is usual upon a little Step to be visible to the Court  WHEN the Court thought they had no more Witnesses to examine and the Man in a few Moments would have been acquitted he gives a Start at the Bar as if he was frighted but recovering his Courage a little he stretches out his Arm towards the Place where the Witnesses usually stood  to give Evidence upon Tryals and pointing with his Hand My Lord says he aloud that is not fair 'tis not according to Law he's not a legal Witness  THE Court is surpriz'd and could not understand what the Man meant but the Judge a Man of more Penetration took the Hint and checking some of the Court that offer'd to speak and which would have perhaps brought the Man back again to himself Hold  says the Judge  the Man sees something more than we do I begin to understand him and then speaking to the Prisoner  WHY  says he  is not he a legal Witness I believe the Court will allow his Evidence to be good when he comes to speak  NO my Lord it cannot be just it can't be allowed  says the Prisoner  with a confused Eagerness in his Countenance that shew'd he had a bold Heart but a guilty Conscience  WHY not Friend what Reason do you give for it  says the Judge  MY Lord  says he  no Man can be allowed to be Winess in his own Case he is a Party my Lord he can't be a Witness  BUT you mistake  says the Judge  for you are indicted at the Suit of the King and the Man may be a Witness for the King as in case of a Robbery on the Highway we always allow the Person robb'd is a good Witness and without this the Highwayman could not be convicted but we shall hear what he says when he is examined  THIS the Judge spoke with so much Gravity and so easie and natural that the Criminal at the Bar answer'd Nay if you will allow him to be a good Witness then I am a dead Man the last Words he said with a lower Voice than the rest but withal called for a Chair to sit down  THE Court order'd him a Chair which if he had not had 'twas thought he would have sunk down at the Bar as he sat down he was observed to be in a great Consternation and lifted up his Hands several times repeating the Words  a dead Man a dead Man  several times over  THE Judge however was at some Loss how to act and the whole Court appear'd to be in a strange Consternation tho' no body saw any thing but the Man at the Bar at length the Judge said to him Look you Mrcalling him by his Name You have but one way left that I know of and I'll read it to you out of the Scripture and so calling for a Bible he turns to the Book of  Joshua  and reads the Text  Josh  vii  And  Joshua  said unto  Achan  my  Son  give I pray thee Glory to the  Lord God of Israel and  make Confession unto him  and  tell me  now  what thou hast done hide it not from me  HERE the Judge exhorted him to confess his Crime for he saw no doubt an Evidence ready to convict him and to discover the whole Matter against him and if he did not confess Heaven would no doubt send Witness to detect him  UPON this the selfcondemn'd Murtherer burst out into Tears and sad Lamentations for his own miserable Condition and made a full Confession of his Crime and when he had done gave the following Account of his Case as to the Reasons of his being under such a Surprize  viz  That he saw the murther'd Person standing upon the Step as a Witness ready to be examined against him and ready to shew his Throat which was cut by the Prisoner and who as he said stood staring full upon him with a frightful Countenance and this confounded him as well it might and yet there was no real Apparition no Spectre no Ghost or Appearance it was all figur'd out to him by the Power of his own Guilt and the Agitations of  his Soul fir'd and surprised by the Influence of Conscience  THE Soul of th  Murther'd Person seeks no Revenge all that Part is swallowed up in the Wonders of the eternal State and Vengeance entirely resign'd to him to whom it belongs but the Soul of the Murtherer is like the Ocean in a Tempest he is in continual Motion restless and raging and the Guilt of the Fact like the Winds to the Sea lies on his Mind as a constant Pressure and adds to that still like the Seas 'tis hurry'd about by its own Weight rolling to and again Motion encreasing Motion 'till it becomes a m  er Mass of Horrour and Confusion  IN this distracted Condition Conscience like a Storm at Sea still breaks over him first gathers about him in a thick black Cloud threatning the Deaths that it comes loaded with and after hovering about him for awhile at last bursts with Lightnings and Thunder and the poor shatter'd Vessel suffers Shipwreck sinks and is overwhelm'd in the Middle of it  IF Justice does not overtake him if he is not discover'd and detected and brought to publick Shame as the Laws of Go  and Man require How is he put to the Question so they call it in Countries abroad when Men are put to the Rack to make them confess how is he tortur'd with the Terrors of his own Thoughts haunted with the Ghosts of his own Imagination and Apparitions without Apparition the murther'd Person is always in his Sight and Cries of Blood are ever in his Ears 'till at last less able to bear the Torture of Mind than the Punishment of his Carcass he even dies for fear of Death murthers himself and goes away in Horror or if Heaven is merciful to him delivers himself up to Justice and dies a Penitent  I COULD give many flagrant Instances of this enough to crowd up this whole Work but I have not room for it take one or two for Examples  A GENTLEMAN and a Man in good Circumstances too committed a Murther in or near St  Pancras SoaperLane London  many Years ago the Murther was attended with some very cruel and barbarous Circumstances such as he could not expect to be pardoned for so he fled and making his Escape into  France  got out of the Reach of Justice  HIS personal Safety was for awhile so much Satisfaction to him that he did not make any Reflections at all upon the Fact but after awhile he took shipping from  France  and went over to  Martinico  where he liv'd several Years and even for two or three Years he carried it off well enough but the first Shock given to his Soul was in a Fit of Sickness when being in Danger of Death he saw as he was between sleeping and waking the Spectre as he thought of the murther'd Person just as in the Posture when he killed him his Wound bleeding and his Countenance ghastly the Sight of which exceedingly terrify'd him and at length awaken'd him  BUT being awake and finding it was but a Dream and that the murther'd Person did not really appear to him and as he call'd it haunt him he was easie as to that Part but being in a high Feaver and believing he should die Conscience began to stare at him and to talk to him he resisted a long time but Death approaching he grew very pensive tho' as he said still more afraid of dying than penitent for his Crime  AFTER he recover'd he grew easie and began to forget things again came over to  Europe  again and being at  Roan  in  Normandy  he dream'd he saw the murther'd Man again and that he look'd  frightful and terrlble and with a threat'ning Aspect and this threw him into a kind of Melancholy which encreas'd exceedingly the Spectre as he call'd it coming to him every Night  BUT this was not all for now as he dreamed of it all Night so he thought of it all Day it was as we say before his Eyes continually his Imagination form'd Figures to him now of this kind then of that always relating to the murther'd Man so that in short he could think of nothing else And tho' he was satisfied there was no real Ghost as he called it or Apparition yet his own terrified Conscience made the Thought be to him like one continued Apparition and the murther'd Man was never out of his Sight  HE was so reduced by the constant Agitation of his Soul that he was in a very weak Condition and in a deep Consumption But in the midst of these Tumults of his Soul he had a strong Impression upon his Mind that he could never die in Peace nor ever go to Heaven if he did not go over to  England  and either get the Parliament's Pardon for it was in those Days when there was no King in  Israel  or that if he could not obtain a Pardon that then he should surrender into the Hands of Justice and satisfy the Law with his Life which was the Debt he owed to the Blood of the Man he kill'd and cou'd no other way be expiated  HE withstood this as a wild distracted thing and the Fruit of his disturb'd Mind What  said be to himself  should I go to  England  for to go there is to GO and DIE and these Words GO and DIE run daily upon his Mind But tho' they came first into his Thoughts as an Answer to his other Distractions yet they turn'd upon him soon after and he dream'd that the dead murther'd Man  aid to him GO and DIE and repeating it said  GO to  England  and DIE and this follow'd him by Night and by Day asleep and awak  that he had it always in his Ears GO to  England  and DIE  IN short and to pass over some Cirumstances tho' worth telling which happen'd to him in the mean time he was so continually terrify'd by the Reproaches of his Conscience and the Voice which he thought follow'd him that he answer'd it once in his Sleep thus Well if it must be so let me alone I will GO and DIE  IT was some time however before he did but at last unable to support the Torture of his Mind he resolv'd to come over to  England  and did so He landed at  Gravesend  and there took Passage in the TiltBoat for  London  WHEN he arriv'd at  London  intending to land at  Westminster  he took a Wherry at  Billinsgate  to carry him through Bridge It happen'd that two Lighters loaden with Coals run foul of the Boat he was in and of one another overagainst  QueenHith  or thereabouts and the Watermen were so very hard put to it that they had much ado to avoid being crush'd between the Lighters so that they were oblig'd to get into one of the Lighters and let the Boat sink  THIS occasion'd him contrary to his Design to go on Shore a little to the Eastward of  QueenHith  from thence he walk'd up on Foot towards  Cheapside  intending to take a Coach for  Westminster  AS he pass'd a Street which crosses out of  Breadstreat  into  Bowlane  being almost Night and he not well knowing the Streets having been absent eighteen Years he heard some body cry Stop him stop him It seems a Thief had broke into a House in some Place as he pass'd by and was discover'd and run for it and the People after him crying Stop him Stop him  IT presently occurr'd to him that being so near the Place where the Murther was committed and where he had lived some body that knew him had seen him and that it was him they cry'd after upon which he began to run with all his Might  HAD the People cry'd  stop Thief  he had had no need to be alarm'd knowing as he said that he had stolen nothing but the Crowd crying only  stop him stop him  it was as likely to be him as not and his own Guilt concurring he run  as above  AS he run with all his Might it was a good while before the People overtook him but just at the Corner of  Soaperlane  near about where now stands the  Rummer Tavern  his Foot slipt and his Breath failing him too he fell down  THE People not knowing who he was had lost their Thief and pursu'd him but when they came up to him they found he was not the right Person and began to leave him but his own Guilty Conscience which at first set him a running and which alone was his real Pursuer continuing to follow him close and which at last had thrown him down too so encreas'd his Fright that believing they all knew him he cry'd out It is very true I am the Man it was I did it  IT seems when he first fell some People who upon hearing the Noise in the Street came running to their Doors as is usual in such Cases I say some People at the Door of a House just against where he fell said one to another There he is that's he they have catch'd him and it was upon that Saying that he answer'd  It is very true I am the Man and I did it  for still he imagin'd they knew him to be the Murtherer that kill'd the Man so long ago whereas there was no body there that  ad any Knowledge of the Matter and the very Memory of the thing was almost forgotten in the Place as it might well b  having been done eighteen Years before  HOWEVER when they heard him cry  I am the Man  and  I did it  one of the People that came about him said What did you do Why I kill'd him says he I kill'd Mrand then repeated his Name but no body remember'd the Name  WHY you are mad says one of the People and then  added another  the Man's a distracted disorder'd Man They pursu'd a little Shoplifting Thief and here they have frighted a poor Gentleman that they own is not the Person but is an unhappy disorder'd Man and fancy'd they pursu'd after him  BUT are you sure he is not the Man  SURE says another Why they tell you so themselves Besides the Man is distracted  DISTRACTED  says a third  how do you know that  NAY  says the other  he must be distracted or in Drink don't you hear how he talks  I did it I kill'd him  and I don't know what Why here's no body kill'd is there I tell you the poor Man is craz'd Thus they talk'd awhile and some run forward towards  Cheapside  to look for the real Thief and so they were about to let him go But one grave Citizen and wiser than the rest cry'd  nay hold  let's enquire  a little further  tho' he's not the Thief they look for  there may be something in it let us go before my  Lord Mayor  with him  and so they did I think the Lord Mayor then in Being was Sir  William Turner  WHEN he came before the Lord Mayor he voluntarily confess'd the Fact and was afterwards executed for it and I had the Substance of this Relation from an Earwitness of the thing so that I can freely say that I give entire Credit to it  IT was remarkable also that the Place where this Man fell down when he run believing he was pursued and known tho' at first he really was not  was just against the very Door of the House where the Person liv'd that he had murther'd  MANY Inferences might be drawn from this Story but that which is particularly to my Purpose is to shew how Men's Guilt crowds their Imagination with sudden and surprizing Ideas of things brings Spectres and Apparitions into their Eyes when there are really no such things forms Ghosts and Phantasms in their very View when their Eyes are shut They see sleeping and dream waking the Night is all Vision and the Day all Apparition 'till either by Penitence or Punishment they make Satisfaction for the Wrong they have done and either Justice or the injur'd Person are appeased  BUT to bring all this back to our Business here's no other Apparation in all this than what are form'd in the Imagination the Ghosts the Souls of the most injur'd Person whether injuriously murther'd or injuriously robb'd and plunder'd sleeps in Peace knows nothing of the Murtherer or Thief except only that it gives that Part all up to the Eternal Judge the Murtherer has the Horror of the Fact always upon him Conscience draws the Picture of the Crime in Apparition just before him and the Reflection not the injur'd Soul is the Spectre that haunts him Nor can he need a worse Tormenter in this Life whether there is a worse hereafter or no I do not pretend to determine This is certainly  a Worm that n  ver dies  'tis always gnawing the Vitals not of the Body but of the very SoulBut I say  here was no Apparition all this while of any kind no Spectre no Ghost no not to detect a Murtherer  NO  Devil  or Evil Spirit as for  Satan  he would rather protect or at least shelter him that he might commit another Murther  NO Soul of the deceased however injur'd  the Man acknowledg'd he never saw any real Apparition  WHAT was it then the Man was exercis'd with I answer he was harrass'd by the Reflection of his own Guilt and the Sluices of the Soul were set open by the Angels or Spirits attending and who by Divine Appointment are always at hand to execute the vindictive Part of Justice as well as the more merciful Dispensations of Heaven when they have them in Commission  THESE abandon'd him to the Fury of an enrag'd Conscience open'd the Sluices of the Soul as I call them and pour'd in a Flood of unsufferable Grief letting loose those wild Beasts call'd Passions upon him such as  Rage Anguish Selfreproach  too late  Repentance  and final  Desperation  all to fall upon him at once so the Man runs to Death for Relief tho' it be to the Gallows or any where and that even by the meer Consequence of Things  BUT if then Oppression Injury Robbery and even Murther it self will not bring the departed injur'd Soul back in Ghost or Apparition if when it is once Uncas'd Dismiss'd or Unembodied its State is determin'd and that it can receive no such Impressions as to be disquieted afterwards much less brought back hither to haunt or perplex the Persons left behind what then shall we say  HOW then can we think they should come back for Trifles nameless Trifles or Trifles not worth naming and what are we to call those real Apparitions which we have Reason to believe are and frequently have been seen in the World what are they nay what can they be but these Angels or Spirits call them what you will who inhabit or have their Station in the great Void or Wast who have the Guard not of our  Atmosphere  only nay not of the  Solar System  only tho' that is of Immense and Inconceiveable Extent and full of distant Planetary Worlds but even of the whole System of the Creation the System of  Empty Space  THESE may and no doubt do visit us every Day whether they are visible to us or no their Business is among us they are posted in their Station as describ'd on purpose to take Cognizance of us and of things belonging to us and done by us  IF Murther Rapine and Oppression is exercis'd upon any these frequently if not always concern themselves either to detect it or to bring the Offender to Justice or both especially in Cases of Blood And this is the best way we can account for the Discovery of Murther which is so general that it is our receiv'd Opinion that Murther very seldom goes undiscover'd that  Murther will out  that is will come out to be known and punished  IF instead of saying Murther  very seldom goes und  scover'd  they had said  seldom goes unpunish'd  I believe it might have been universally true for sometimes secret Murthers are never discover'd to the Persons who knew of the Fact or in the Place where it was committed but how are they pursu'd by the Divine Vengeance that is to say under the Ministry of these happy Instruments who fail not to pursue the Murtherer perhaps it may be the only Case wherein they are Agents of Justice without a mixture of Mercy  HOW many secret and 'till then undiscover'd Murthers do these happy Instruments oblige the guilty Wretches to discover which no Human Eye had been Witness to Some are discover'd as in the Example above and brought to Punishment Some at the Gallows whither the Criminal is brought for other Crimes some upon sick Beds and in View of Eternal Judgment some in Shipwrecks some in Battels some one way some another  NOR can it be deny'd that tho' these angelick ministring Spirits were to be constant Messengers of Justice in such Cases yet it would be much more merciful than to give the Soul of the injur'd murther'd Person leave to come back arm'd with Power and with the Terrors of its invisible State to do it self Justice inflam'd with the Resentments which it might be reasonable to suppose it must have at the Injury receiv'd able to tear the Murtherer in Pieces and in Condition to ca  ry on its own Quarrel and execute the Divine Justice in revenge of its private Quarrel  THIS would be inconsistent with the supreme Prerogative of Heaven by which he has taken all executive Justice into his own Hand all Retribution all retaliating Justice and that on purpose to restrain the Rage and Fury of Men who would be unbo  nded in the vindictive Part and set no Limits to their Vengeance which for that very Reason I say God has declar'd he takes into his own Hand  Vengeance is  MINE  I will rep  y  Rom xii  IF it were not thus the World would be a Field of Blood and Confusion the departed Soul of a murthered Person would be always harrassing not the Murtherer only but all the Persons concern'd in his Injury and without Mercy would call every one a Murtherer that was on the side of his Enemy whether guilty or not in a word suppose he dy'd fighting he would come back to revenge his own Death fir'd with a double Rage and arm'd with an irresistible Ability to revenge  BUT not to confine my self to the Case of a Murtherer only If Souls after Death could return to visit those who they had any Concerns with here let the Occasion be what it would the World would be all Confusion and Disorder Q  arrels and Contentions would never cease Feuds  of Families would not die but the injur'd Person would always come back to right himself  AND how do we know that they would even in that enlightned State of Being be impartially just considering they would act in their own Causes Are we sure they would not insist upon pretended Right as they did perhaps when living if so then we must have Appeals even from the Spirits themselves for they would be as liable to do Injury in their Revenge as those yet living had been to do to them  HERE we might make a rational Excursion upon the present State of Things What would be the case if all the injur'd Souls now in a determin'd State were able to come back and demand Justice of the present Age what work would it make among us how many wealthy Landlords would be turn'd out of Possession and rich Tradesmen oblig'd to refund How would the strong Oppressor be challeng'd by the weak the injur'd Poor be the ruin of the Rich How many Adulterers would be bound to dislodge from the Arms of the fair Intruder How many injur'd Ladies would claim their Properties and turn the Usurpers out of Bed  HOW would youngbe call'd upon to do right to a whole Family whose Tears for the marrying one Sister and debauching the other have hitherto been in vain How would the civil Rape be discover'd and the Artifices be detected which broke two Hearts for want of doing right to one  HOW long ago would the Soul ofhave appear'd to do her self Justice which a wheedl'd  C  a brib'dand a sleepydeny'd her and to demand the Sentence which the plain acknowledgment of her Murtherers cou'd not extort from them  HOW would she have haunted the Retirement of the guilty Wretch and have beaten him out of all  his Subterfuges 'till he had come upon his Knees to the Hangman and begg'd to be dismiss'd from a Hell so much worse than that he had reason to expect he was going to or have been his own Drudge and have anticipated Justice by an immediate dispatch  BUT they have been left to the Iron Hands of yet slumbring Justice which Conscience however it may at present forbear must soon tell them will be not the less certain for the delay  BUT let us leave the Mechanick Criminals and enquire of the superior Ranks of Men How many usurping Tyrants possess the Thrones of oppress'd and perhaps murther'd Princes while the Blood of Armies nay of whole Nations speaking as to Number has been sacrific'd to support the Ambition of one Man  WHAT Mercy to Mankind has the supreme Lord exhibited in this wise allotment of Things  viz  That the Grave buries all the Rage of humane Resentment the Oppressed and the Oppressor rest together the Murtherer and the Murthered the most inveterate Enemies the conquer'd in Battel and the Slain of the conquering Army make one heap of quiet and peaceable Dust blended together and mould'ring into the common Element of Earth  ALL the Animosity being fled with the enrag'd Souls carries with it the very remains of the Quarrel and they no more appear Enemies but freely encorporate their Dust with one another The late D  Ha    n  might have been buried in the same Grave nay in the same Coffin with the Lord  Mo    n  and their Swords left in their Hands the Souls of the noble Enemies would never have concerned themselves again with the Quarrel  HEAVEN who thought fit to cool the Rage of their Minds by their own unhappy Hands and make 'em reciprocally the Executioners of the Divine  Pleasure upon themselves has thought fit also to take from both the power of determining any more who was right and who was wrong and oblig'd them mutually to refer the further enquiry to himself  THE two  Danish  Soldiers who fought at  Beverly  one kill'd upon the spot and the other immediately shot to Death for fighting and buried together there they lie quiet in one Grave the Souls of them never visit one another to complain of the Injury  COULD Souls departed come back to demand Redress of Grievances and to put Men in mind of the Injustice done them could they challenge the living Possessors of their Estates for the Frauds by which they were obtained what Confusion would  ExchangeAlley  and the  Exchange  of  London  be in what distraction would it make in all the Affairs of Life and how soon would the Men who amass'd immense Wealth  Ann  disappear like  W  of  Hack  and sink under the guilt of their good Fortune  IN a word it would invert the Order of Eternal Justice for it would make this Earth be the Place of Rewards and Punishments and take the Executive Power out of the Hands of the great Governour of the World  DEPEND then upon it the Souls of our departed Friends or Enemies are all in their fix'd and determin'd State whether arriv'd at a full Consummation of Felicity or Misery that is not the case nor is it any part of the Question but they are so remov'd from all possibility of return Hither or concern with us that the very Suggestion however it has for many Ages prevail'd in the World is full of Absurdity The Joys of the Happy are so compleat so exalted so superior that the greatest Affairs of this World are too trifling to take up the  least Moment or give the least Interruption to their Felicity as a poor or mean Man that having a vast Estate left him in his immediate Possession quits his decay'd outofrepair Cottage upon the Waste and having his Hands full of Gold or even Bags of Gold scorns to take up the Rags and Rubbish of his old dirty Habitation but says to his Servants Let any one take 'em that will I have enough here  ON the other hand the rejected and condemn'd Soul loaded with his own Crime and sinking under the Weight of inexpressible Horror shall he have any thought about the hated World he came out of he who abhors and hates the place where he spent a long Life of such Crime as now loads him with insupportable Punishment is he at leisure or in composure for concerning himself in Life any more where he has already so miserably ruin'd himself Soul and Body  IF he was to come back hither for any thing it would probably be to take the heaps of his illgotten Treasure from the unjust Possessor his Heir and making restitution with it to the Poor whom he had oppress'd to the Widows he had robb'd and in general to all those he had injur'd leave his Family in Poverty and Rags instead of their Robes and Velvet and in Hospitals and Almshouses rather than Palaces and Parks and with Coaches or Horses Proving the Proverb untrue and showing that the Son may not be always happy tho' the Father be gone to the  Devil  I DOUBT it would make but sad work among some Families who now possess large Estates if the Notion some People entertain about Spirits and about haunting of Houses should be true Namely that the Souls departed could not be at rest 'till Satisfaction was made in such and such cases where Injury had been done to Orphans and Widows and  'till such Injustice was prevented as was farther like to be done by their means  AS to what Rest the Souls of those departed would have I am not to resolve but I doubt the Souls and Bodies too of those that remain would have small Rest here if that were true  IS it not rather a Proof that the Soul cannot return hither to do Right to the injur'd race of those whom it had oppress'd with Violence when embodied that the Ghost or Soul ofsleeps in its absent State and does not call upon his too happy Heir and charge him to make reparation in its Name for all the Ravages and Plunder out of which he rais'd those Millions he left behind If Usury Extortion Perjury and Blood are Injuries that disquiet the Souls unembodied How is it that the Souls of all the Families and even Nations of Families oppress'd and ruin'd by the latedo not come and do themselves right out of the immense Wealth left in possession to those who 'till that Justice be obtain'd could have no Claim to it  BUT to let the Injur'd and the Injurious sleep together as they do without disturbing or being disturb'd by one another let us ask a few Questions of the living How would a certain wandring Right Honourable most simply elevated Object of human Pity be terrified at the Apprehensions of meeting the dishonour'd Souls of his Ancestors and particularly of his pious Grandfather who would if it were possible chastise him for his Lunacy and drive him home to the Feet of a merciful Sovereign to ask Pardon for the most preposterous things that ever humane Rage drove any Man in his Senses to be guilty of  IF the Souls of wise Men could be disquieted for the mad things done by their Posterity what Regret must the Ancestors of all the exil'd Heirs of  Noble Blood now have who see their Sons forfeiting the ple  tiful Fortunes they left them by the most ridiculous and utterly improbable Scheme of the late  Preston  and  Dumblain  Affair an Attempt without Success because without rational Prospect without humane Probability and fo  which as the late happy Lord  Derwentwater  said they should not have been sent to the  Tower  but to  Bedlam  IF Souls could return how should our Friends the  A    s  and  B    s  and  S    s  sleep in their Beds while they enjoy the ruins of so many Families and the fortunes of so many Sufferers who hang'd themselves in Desperation for the loss and why do they not see Apparitions every Night from the injur'd Ghosts of  L    Ba    W    Hu  and a thousand more who could they repass the Gulph would certainly harrass them 'till they should be glad to dismiss themselves the same way and run to that Hell which they know nothing of from that Hell of Selfreproach which they would be no longer able to endure  I COULD descend to Particulars 'till I fill'd a Roll too long for your reading and I know not whether it might not be true as Sir  W    B    d  said in another case that he believ'd all would come up that was under Ground and his Grandfather would come with the rest and call for his Estate again  THE Doctrine of disquiet Souls returning hither to do or obtain Justice to make or demand Restitution and that they could not be at rest 'till such and such things were settled Wills perform'd dispossess'd Heirs righted conceal'd Treasons discover'd conceal'd Treasures found out and the like were it true would make the World uninhabitable Ghosts and Apparitions would walk the Streets at NoonDay and the living might go on one side of the Street and the dead on the other the latter would be infinitely more numerous  NOTHING can be more proposterous than such a Notion It is true that the examples given or pretended to be given of it are but few and that very part is against them for if the thing is real why are they but few It must be acknowledg'd as the times go the cases of the injur'd and oppress'd are not few On the contrary as God said of the old World the whole Earth is fill'd with Violence Whence is it then if injur'd Souls or the Souls of injur'd oppress'd ruin'd People could return that there are not Millions haunting the Doors nay the Closets and BedChambers of those that enjoy the Wealth which was so unjustly obtain'd  IF it could be at all the Number would be infinitely more for why should one guilty Soul be uneasy and not another All the guilty would come back to make Restitution as far as they were able and all the Sufferers would come back to obtain it  AGAIN the Condition of those that enjoy the illgotten Wealth of their Ancestors would be deplorable the Souls of guilty Parents would harrass their Sons for the Estate to make Restitution and the Souls of the oppress'd Sufferers would haunt them to get their own restor'd so that they only would be easy in the World who had nothing to restore or who enjoyed nothing but what was of their own getting they only would sleep at Night who had ballanc'd with the Day who had earn'd what they Eat and had Eaten no more than they earn'd  BUT this we see is not the case that the Souls of the most guilty remain where they are and the Souls of the most oppress'd do not come hither to complain strongly implies and is to me a sufficient proof that their State is determin'd that the Gulph is fixed that they can only look back with  SelfReproach but cannot come back to give themselves the Satisfaction of doing Justice to those they have injur'd that the murther'd Person cannot come back no not to detect the Murtherer or the plunder'd Traveller to discover the Highwayman It is plain to me and will pass for Evidence that they cannot because they do not and 'tis plain to me that some do not because all do not for if any why not all  IT does not consist with the inlightned Justice of that State which we believe is beyond Life to let one injured Soul come hither to obtain Justice against the Oppressor of his Family and not let another have the same Liberty or to let one injurious Soul return to make Restitution and make his Peace that he may be at Rest as they call it and lock up another from it who would be equally willing to do it and is equally miserable in the want of it  THAT it is not so is a sufficient Testimony to me that it cannot be so and the miserable Condition the World would be in here if it were so makes it clear to me that the Wisdom of Providence has otherwise determined it  NOR would the Advantage be any thing considerable at least not in proportion to the Disorder it would bring along with it and were we to allow the Possibility it would bring in so many Absurdities with it in Points of Religion that it would destroy the establish'd Doctrines of all Religion For Example  FIRST  We believe that the final Estate of the Soul is determined with Life and  as the Tree falls so it must lie  that  This is the State of Tryal That the State of Retribution  If so then to what purpose should the Souls of the Dead desire to come back unless they were to have a farther Probation or that there was a Possibility of retrieving their State  and recovering from the Sentence they were under and if the divine Wisdom had left room for that it would have as well spared them in Life 'till it had been done  SECONDLY  To what Purpose should the Soul come back to do Justice if doing that Justice could make no Alteration of its future State If it could make any Alteration then there must be room after Death to recover the Soul from eternal Death and if there was the Eyes may be supposed to be so open'd there that none would omit or neglect it  THIRDLY  If coming hither or doing Justice here can be no Help to the Souls departed and yet they desire it you must then suppose a strong Desire of doing disinterested Good may possess the Souls of those who are in a State of Condemnation which is inconsistent with the other Circumstances of Hell which we have just Reason to believe shuts out all good Desires and all good Principles from the Souls that are there  FOURTHLY  The Supposition of Souls being in a Condition after Death to return hither destroys all the Descriptions which the Scripture gives us of the future Condition either of the good or bad Souls but that I hinted before  UPON the whole 'tis a Notion however it may have been received here perfectly inconsistent with either Reason or reveal'd Religion and I may venture to say it cannot be 'tis impossible and that all the Pretences of a Ghost or Apparition saying it is such a Person and that it cannot be at Rest 'till so and so be done and that now it shall go to God must be a Delusion and must be added by the Persons relating the Story for that no Ghost or Spirit really happy could say so or would impose so much upon us  CHAP VIII The Reality of Apparition farther asserted and what Spirits they are that do really appear  THE affirming as in the foregoing Chapters that the unembodied Souls of Men do not appear again or concern themselves in the Affairs of Life that the Good would not if they could and the Bad could not if they would does not at all destroy the Reality of the thing call'd Apparition or do I pretend to argue from thence that there is no such thing as any Apparition at all on the contrary I insist it is reasonable to believe not withstanding all that has been said that there are such things as the Apparition of Spirits and this I think I have already prov'd past the Power of any Scruple or Cavil as also that there have been such things in all Ages of the World  THE Doctrine of the Existence of Spirits is established in Nature where those Spirits reside is Matter of Difficulty and our Speculations are various about them but to argue that therefore there are none that they exist not that there are no such Beings is absurd and contrary to the Nature of the thing we may as well argue against the Existence of the Sun when it is clouded and eclips'd tho' we see its Light only because we cannot see its Beams or the Globe of its Body But let us go back to the Principle  SPIRIT  as it is to be consider'd here  is to be reduced to four general Heads  FIRST  The Author of all  Spirit  the Fountain of all Being the Original Cause of Life and the Creator both of Spirit and of all the Subsequents of it This we justly adore as the Infinite Eternal Spirit  GOD is a SPIRIT  SECONDLY Angels  or good Spirits which  re real Spirits we have Demonstration of it and they have and do appear daily as the great Author of all Spirit directs for the Service of Mankind for they are  ministring Spirits  THIRDLY Devils  or evil Spirits these are really Spirit too of a spirituous N  ture 'tis true they are deprived of their Beauty their Original Glory because depriv'd of their Innocence they are deform'd as well as defil'd by Crime but they are not depriv'd of their Nature they are Spirits still tho' cast down and cast out and are call'd  wicked Spirits  FOURTHLY Souls  of Men whether good or bad their Condition may be as you please to speak of it Happy or Unhappy the Case is the same it does no way alter their Nature but still they are  Spirits  The  Spirits of just Men made perfect  there's the happy Spirits  the Spirits in Prison  and there's the unhappy but both are Spirits and are to be discours'd of as such in this Place  NOW let us bring all this down to our present Purpose I have asserted  their Being  let me enquire into  their State  as it respects our Subject how far they may or may not can or cannot appear among Men in their present Circumstances How they have visited this Earth at several Times and on what Occasions has been mentioned already and as much at large as the design'd Brevity of this Work admits of  IT remains to enquire what we have to expect of them for the future and in particular who we may expect to see at any time hereafter which of them may visit us for the time to come and which  may not or can not be reasonably expected and this I shall do with the same Clearness if possible and in very few Words  OF the four Kinds of Spirit then let us consider the First and the Last  FIRST  GOD the Soul and Life the Being of all  Spirit  has appear'd as I have said but we are to expect him  no more  I do not say he cannot appear to us but I believe I may say he has determined to bless the World with no more such glorious Exhibitions no more personal Appearances of the Eternal Face 'till the most glorious Appearance spoken of in Scripture  Tit  ii  Looking for the blessed Hope and the glorious appearing of the GREAT GOD    SECONDLY  The dismiss'd departed unembodied Spirits which we call Souls of Men whether happy or miserable can by no means appear among us all Apparition of that Kind is fictitious and imaginary never was practicable except once by Miracle and never can again be practicable and therefore is not to be expected We are told indeed that once on the extraordinary Occasion of the Resurrection of Christ and to honour that Resurrection with a Miracle of the most sublime Nature  the Graves were opened and the Bodies of the Saints arose and appeared  c The Word is they  Arose  and came out of their Graves after his Resurrection  Mat  xxvii I might enlarge upon the Nature of this Apparition of the Saints which slept the manner of it and especially the Reason of it and shew you how it was really miraculous and done to convince the doubting Disciples of the Truth of the Resurrection which some of them being perhaps originaly  Sadduces  might still question but my Business is with an Age not too much delighted in serious Excursions so I must not make any Trespass however seasonable or turn grave however useful  LET it then be sufficient to the Purpose this Apparition of Souls was extraordinary and miraculous and we are to expect them no more their State is determined the happy are too happy and their Happiness too firmly fix'd to suffer any such Interruption the Unhappy have their Confinement too firmly fix'd to break Prison and get out in a word these cannot and the other would not if they could and we are not to expect to see or hear from them any more on this Earth 'till the Restitution of all things and 'till they shall be all summon'd to that grand Appearance which we believe will one Day happen whatever our flaming Age pretend to say to the contrary  ALL Apparition then of these two Heads or Species being concluded impossible in Nature and not to be expected we must look for it then among the Angelick Spirits and here indeed it is to be found Angels of all the Kinds have appear'd may and do appear and of them alone are all the Apparitions which have any Reality in them form'd  THIS is bringing the Matter into a narrow Compass and putting an end to Cavil and Quarrel about it there is no need to wrangle upon it any more but when you at any time see an Apparition or Appearance of Spirit assuming Shape and Voice and you are sure it is really an Apparition not a  Deceptio Visus  a Cloud a Vapour of the Imagination I say whenever you see such an Apparition depend upon it 'tis an Angel or a  Devil  I HAVE only one Distinction to make here which tho' it be necessary shall be very short and clear  viz  That when I speak of Angels I mus  be understood as follows  FIRST  The Word Angel is to be understood of good Angels for the  Devils  as I have said ar  also Angels Satan is called an Angel of Light  but the evil Angels I shall always treat with their new Sirname  Devil  so that when I speak of Angels I am always to be understood of the good Angels  SECONDLY  But of good Angels these I distinguish also into two Kinds  THE Angels which are actually in Heaven such as we read of  Gabriel Michael  and others not distinguished by Name these have appeared amongst Men upon this Earth as I have also said before at large but even these we have Reason to believe we shall see no more God having pleased to discover himself to his People now in another Way by another Ministration namely by his Spirit and by an Evangelick not an Angelick Ministry  THAT Rank of Angels or Spirits call them as we please and whether inferior or not we are not to determine who are plac'd by the Direction of God himself in a nearer Situation to us plac'd I say by their Maker under his superior Providence for the Direction and Conduct of human Creatures and of their Affairs or at least to Guard them from the Invasions Threatning and Hellish Designs of the Prince of Darkness and his Angels and these as I said might well be call'd Guardian Angels to the whole Earth  NOW these two sorts of Spirit  viz  the Guardian Angels the good Spirits detach'd as I may and did call it from Heaven to have the Inspection over and Care of his new Creation as well here as elsewhere these and the  Devils  that other sort of Angels of whom I may have Occasion to speak more than a great deal in this Work These I say may and do appear and all Apparition is really between them all Spirit you can speak of or pretend to see the Appearance of must be one of these two must be  Angel  or  Devil  there is no other there  can be no other Miracle and something more than miraculous and Things which we have no Reason to look for only excepted  BUT on the other hand as certain as that no other Spirit does or can and as certainly as they do not or cannot appear so as certain and past dispute is it that these Spirits both good and bad do appear to us upon all Occasions I mean all Occasions which they judge needful and which happens to them whether by choice or constraint It is not indeed in us to determine how they are mov'd to go upon these Errands or in what manner I may perhaps give some probable Opinions about the Manner and Causes both of their Mission and Permission for I take those two Heads to contain the Regulation of their Actings I say  Commission  and  Permission  and without these we are sure never to be visited in this manner either by one or other  IT is true that this gives a considerable Sanction to the Thing call'd Apparition in general and makes it appear to be more solemn than we are willing to make it for by this Rule neither  Devil  or  Angel  appears but upon some extraordinary Occasion and if it be so I do not see why we should like it the worse for if they were to shew themselves upon every trifling Occasion they would either terrifie Mankind so as to make the World intollerable to him or familiarise themselves so as not to be regarded  NOW as it would be the  Devil  not the good Spirits that would thus haunt the World upon Trifles for the other cannot be supposed to do it so they would carry on the Familiarity too far and Men would be so far from being frighted and terrified at him that in short there would be more Danger in the Intimacy and as we say in another  Case Mankind and the  Devil  might be too well acquainted  BUT first to the Fact that these Spirits both good and bad Do thus APPEAR and then to the Reason of it That they do appear the History Experience and Report of all Ages confirm it they always have and still do The Appearances of Spirits are confirmed many ways History is full of Examples and sacred History itself tho' it does not give Relation of particular Apparitions yet confirms the thing as a Reality and out of Question  CHRIST himself after his Resurrection seeing his Disciples frighted and terrified at his Appearance takes a great deal of Pains to convince them that he was not a Spirit or an Apparition as they feared  Luke  xxiv  They were terrified and affrighted and suppos'd that they had seen a Spirit  This would be what it is too dishonourable to say of the sacred Writ if Apparition of Spirit in the Shape of Body did never come and that there were no such thing in Nature  SEE then what our blessed Lord says to them upon it  v    Behold my Hands and my Feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye sce me have  This is as direct and positive as any thing of its kind can be suppos'd or desir'd to be If there were no such things as Spirits appearing how could Jes  s Christ have expressed himself in such a manner the Language is plain You think you see a Spirit that is an Apparition and you may have some Reasons for your Apprehension because I came in thus unseen when the Door was shut Now a Spirit may indeed assume a Shape and look like the Person it appears for but if you were to come near to it you would find a Spirit an Apparition has only the Appearance  it has not Flesh and Bones as  you see me have  Therefore I am not a  Spectre  or  Apparition  but a real Body  SO when he came walking upon the Sea to his Disciples and they were so frighted that they cried out believing that they had seen a Spirit it must be out of Question that there were such things and that they the Disciples had heard of them nay perhaps they had seen such Apparitions themselves before that why else should they be so frighted as to cry out  Matth  xiv  And when the Disciples saw him walking on the Sea they were troubled saying It is a Spirit and they cried out for fear  And why when our Saviour spoke to them did he not reprove them for being frighted at their own Imagination and fa  cy like Children that they saw a Spirit when there were no such things in the World and no Apparitions to be seen  ON the other hand he speaks kindly to them knowing that Apparitions are frightful Things to People not used to see them and bids them  be of good Cheer  it is not a Spirit  it is I be not afraid  'tis no Apparition but myself in reality So also you have the Story  Mark  vi  AGAIN you have a perfect Description of an Apparition in the very manner we are just now discoursing about it  Job  iv  Then a Spirit passed before my Face the Hair of my Flesh stood up It stood still but I could not discern the Form thereof an Image was before mine Eyes there was silence and I heard a Voice Eliphaz  as a Man of Sense he was not deluded to speak of Things not in Being he saw an Apparition not a Fancy  AGAIN  Joshua  saw an Apparition as I mention'd once before  Josh  v  A Man with a drawn Sword in his Hand  This was an Angel that is to say a Spirit and yet it spoke to him and had the Shape of a Ma  in Arms with a Sword in his  Hand Had  Joshua  offer'd to touch it or been permitted to touch it he would not have found it had  Flesh  and  Bones  we have our Saviour's Words for it  A Spirit has not  FLESH  and  BONES an Apparition is a Spirit assuming a Shape of Flesh and Blood but without the Reality  AND this Answers all those fanciful People who say to us that they saw such or such a Person I saw him says the Ignorant frighted Visionist perfectly I know him well enough I am sure 'twas him I saw him plainly Hence they conclude it must be the Soul of such a Person because say they it had his very Countenance and his Cloaths on nay riding on the same Horse as he us'd to ride on when the truth of the Case is this the Man is dead his Body rotting in the Grave his Soul carried into the remote Regions of eternal Felicity or Horror unalterable and that immoveable as to returning this Way his Cloaths that were seen are lying in the Chest or the Press where they usually lay and the poor Horse grasing in the Field or perhaps quiet in the Stable and not at all disturb'd All that is to be said the good Angel that perhaps had some secret Commission to the Relict or Remains of the Man's Family to give them Notice of some Evil to warn to admonish c assumes the Shape and Appearance of the Man himself cloaths himself in his Likeness forms the Apparition in Air of his Cloaths his Countenance his Horse as a Painter cloathes the Cloth he paints on with Faces Postures Habits Garments all i  Colours while the passive Person represented is no way affected with or concerned in the Draught representing him  AND why should not this Spirit thus commission'd to go on such an Errand be able to amuse us with the Appearance of a Person departed taking up his Shape Count  na  ce Cloaths c  tho' the Soul of the Pe  son is not affected with or concern'd in it when it is known that we often see Apparitions of Persons living whom we see and speak to and converse with know their Faces their Voices their Cloaths and yet the Persons themselves know nothing of the matter  I HAVE by me a very diverting History upon this Subject which I shall abridge for the present purpose as follows  viz  A CERTAIN young Lady ofborn in the County ofhad been long courted by a young Gentleman whose Father had a very good Estate in the same Town she had kept him Company too openly but had not yielded to his Importunities for a criminal Conversation tho' her Reputation suffer'd for it as if she had but at length she was so far overpersuaded that she made an Appoin  ment to be at such a time at a Farmer's House a Tenant of his Father's and who were it seems let into the wicked Secret Accordingly she dresses herself up with the best of her Art to recommend herself to the  Devil  I may say and away she goes to meet him having her Servan  Maid to attend her because it was over some Fields that she was to go  WHEN she was n  ar the House she finds some Excuse or Err  to send ba  k her Maid to the Town the Wench it s  ems not being privy to the Business  AS she turns about to dismiss her Maid the Maid offer'd to go farther 'till she was nearer the House but her Mistress sees the Minister of the Town coming along the Path and making that the Excuse O says she there's our Minister Drcoming so I shall have his Company you may go back  Mary  I shall be safe enough  THE Maid sees the Minister also and goes back accordingly  AS soon as the Minister came up to her for he seem'd to overtake her presently he gives her the usual Compliment and asks her how she came to be in the Fields alone  SHE answer'd she had not been alone but having Occasion to send b  ck her Maid she dismiss'd her the sooner because she saw him coming and besides says she I am going but to that House there naming the Farmer's Name  O MADAM says the Doctor are you going thither then I know your Errand  SHE was surpriz'd and blush'd but recovering a little What Errand Sir says she  WHY Madam says he it may not be proper for me to name the Business but you know it well enough  WHAT d' ye mean Sir says she I don't understand you  WHY says he your Favourite the young Esquire is there before you  SHE was terribly surprized then and could hardly speak to him being touch'd with Shame and Indignation supposing the young Gentleman had boasted of her Favours before he had receiv'd them and had betray'd her however she made still strange of it and having it may be suppos'd conquer'd her Modesty so far as to make a Promise or Appointment to sacrifice her Virtue to him she might the easier conquer the Surprize so she seemed to slight it  BUT Madam says the Minister if you would take my Adviceand there he stop'd  WHAT  dvice Sir says she I don't understand what you mean  WHY I wou'd advise you to go back to the Town again and not go into the way of Mischief  SHE still withstood and put him off with the usual Answer I don't understand you what do y  mean and the like but at last the Minister raising his Voice a little like to that of a stern Reprover  COME come young Lady  says he  you can't conceal your wicked Purposes you have made Mran Appointment he prevail'd on you last Night and you have now deck'd yourself up with your Ornaments to meet him and prostitute your Virtue and your Honour and your Conscience all to his corrupt vicious Appetite and I know it you may see that I do my Advice to you is to go back and break your wicked Promise and repent that you made it I shall give him the same Advice pr  sently  IF she was surpriz'd before she was confounded now partly with Horror at the Fact itself which now she was struck a little with the Sense of and partly but Tenfold more with the Shame of its being known It put her into such Confusion that at first she could not answer a Word but after awhile she said If you know the Gentleman is there Sir I shall not go especially since you have such hard Thoughts of me and upon saying this she turns about and goes directly back again and the Minister went from her towards the H  use As the Farmer liv'd but a very little way from the Place where she stood talking with him she look'd behind her and saw him go into the House and the Door shut after him  ANY one will suppose upon this shock to her Design and being not only disappointed in her wicked Pleasures but expos'd and betray'd as she imagin'd by her Lover she w  nt directly home without any stay and there gave vent to her Passions with the utmost Rage and with all the Resentment that such base Treatment could inspire her with  THE Gentleman on the other hand being extremely disappointed and not knowing what could be the reason of it after he had waited a long time came back to see what was the Matter believing she must be taken ill or that something had happen'd very extraordinary  WHEN he came to the House she liv'd it seems with an Aunt whose Husband was also dependent upon the young Gentleman's Father he enquir'd for his Mistress but her Maid brought him Word that she could not be spoken with  THAT Answer not being satisfactory and having refus'd to be answered with two or three more such Excuses at last she sent him Word plainly that she had nothing to say to him and that she not only would not see him now but would never see him more  SURPRIZ'D with this and not able to guess the Meaning of it he goes away but the next Morning writes her a very civil obliging Letter wherein among abundance of the usual Expressions of Lovers he begs to know what he had done that should merit such Treatment and that she would let him into so much at least of the Causes of her Displeasure as should put him in a way to clear himself protesting that he kn  w not the least Step he had taken to disoblige her except in punctually attending her Appointment and having the Mortification of sitting five Hours by himself in Expectation of her Company  IN Answer to this she sent him a long Letter full of Reproaches for his vile Usage of her drawing her into a sinful shameful Compliance with him and then exposing her and triumphing over her Weakness making her with one hand the pretended Object of his Amour and with the other the Sport of his Companions She upbraided him with telling her that he sat five Hours alone  whereas he had much better Company than she could have been seeing the good Doctor who had admonished her not to expose her self in meeting him had given him the same good Advice that he had done to her and so had not made so bad a use of his Treachery in betraying her as he expected  SHE concluded with telling him 'twas her Happiness that this came to her Knowledge before she had thrown her self into the Arms of a Traitor and tho' he had done her the Injustice to boast of her Weakness she thank'd God he triumph'd when he had gain'd but half a Victory hat she was infinitely beholden to him for her Deliverance and that it was the only Obligation he had ever laid upon her  IF I could give you the Entertainment of all the Letters that pass'd between them while they were both under the Amusement of the mysterious Part and perfectly ignorant of the Occasion and then add the Surprize of the Discovery it would make two Acts of a good Comedy but I must shorten the Story as much as I can  HE was so surpriz'd with this Answer from his Mistress that he could not tell what to make of it and especially those Paragraphs which related to the good Doctor's admonishing her and being in his Company all which as he really had known nothing of it so there was no guessing at the meaning of it 'Twas impossible so much as to have the least Notion about it 'twas all Confusion and Darkness and without the least Meanin  that he could come at In a word abundance of  etters pass'd between them but still she continu'd using him after the same manner talk'd the same style about his betraying her and that he acted the very Part of the  D  il  first to tempt and then to accuse first  o draw her in with a thousand Importunities and then expose her for complying She reproach'd  him with the many Sollicitations and Protestations of Affection and appeal'd to him to testifie whether he had made an easie Conquest and whether she had not  so long  withstood his most incessant Assaults challeng'd him to tell how long he had besieg'd her and whether she had yielded at last but on an honourable Capitulation tho' unhappily she had granted Possession without the due Securities She ask'd him why when he triumph'd over her Honour he had not had so much Generosity to own what the Treaty had cost him and how long it was before he had gain'd that little he had to boast of  HE protested at large that he was perfectly surpriz'd at the whole Affair understood not one Word of it could not dive into her Meaning abhorr'd the Thought of what she charg'd him with and at last very warmly insisted upon her explaining her self and that otherwise as she did him so much Injustice he would do himself Justice for he heard she made it too publick and that tho' he had not done it yet being tender of her Character yet he could not bear to be treated in this manner and not know something of the Reason of it  AT last he press'd her to let him but speak with her which tho' it was long before she would grant yet she did consent to at last lest he should expose her  AT this Interview they began to come to an Understanding she own'd that she was coming to the Place but that she saw the Minister go in just before her which made her go back again but she did not tell him a Word of her seeing the Minister on the Way  HE protested there was no Minister came to him or into the House and afterwards brought the People of the House to testifie the same that he sat all the while in the Parlour reading a Book and that no Creature came near him nor so much as to the Door  THIS startled her and at last with much Importunity she told him the whole Story of her meeting with the Doctor in the Fields and in a word how the Doctor told her where she was going and to who that he was there wating for her and which confounded her worse than all had told her what she was going about adding that she had made the Promise the Night before and that he meaning the Gentleman had told him so  N B  In this Part she was mistaken the Doctor said  he had been told of it as soon as she had made the Promise  and she in her Surprize understood it that he said the Gen  leman told him  HE was so full of this heavy Charge and himself in every Part so clear of it that it was impossible he should sit still with it He knew not what to make of it he knew very well that he had never open'd his Mouth to any one Man Woman or Child about it that the Farmer or any of his Family knew not a Word of it only that he was to me  t her there as they had frequently done before and innocently enough and he could not suppose she could be so weak to talk of it her self so that he could not yet imagine what it could be  A FEW Days furnish'd him with an Opportunity to talk with the Minister himself who came frequently to his Father's House and being one Day very free wi  h him he jested with him for hindring him of two or three Hours of very good Company  THE Doctor answer'd him he should be very sorry to be guilty of any thing so rude and desir'd to know how it could be  WHY Doctor says he we were with some Friends very merry at such a House insinuating that there was more Company and such a Lady says he naming her was coming to us and you met her and persuaded her to go back again  SIR  says the Doctor  I have only one Satisfaction in the whole Story and that is that it cannot be true as I shall soon satisfie you  NAY Doctor  says the Gentleman  I don't tell it you as of my own Knowledge  NO Sir  says the Doctor  and I should not have so little Respect as to tell you it was false if you had told it me as of your own Knowledge  BUT do you assure me  says the Gentleman  that it is not true  I DO assure you  says the Doctor  upon my Word that I know nothing of it  WHY Doctor says the Gentleman do you give me your Word that you did not meet her in the Fields next to Farmer  Gi  's House on the eleventh Day of the very last Month being  August  for I have it all down in black and white  He pulls out his PocketBook and looks for the Day of the Month  here  NOT only not that Day  says the Doctor  but I never saw her in those Fields or any other Fields in my Life  WHY you surprize me Doctor  says the Gentleman  it is impossible  I APPEAL to the Lady her self  says the Doctor  NAY Doctor  says the Gentleman  if you appeal to her you must be cast for I will swear she told me so her self  THIS confounded the Doctor for a little while but he presently recover'd himself Sir  says he  I was going to desire of you that we might wait upon Mrstogether and that I might hear it from her self but upon recollecting all the Circumstances I am very happy in one thing namely that let her say so her self and forty Ladies more I can prove to you that it is impossible it should be true  THAT will indeed put an End to it all  says the Gentleman  but how can you do that  WHY Sir  says the Doctor  are you sure she does not give you a wrong Day  NO no  says the Gentleman  I have a Reason why it can't be a Mistake of the Day for I have a Memorandum of the Day upon a remarkable  He had set it down in his Book upon the Occasion of his being disappointed  Occasion  AND it is not the Lady's Mistake then  says the Doctor  for you know Women are not always the exactest in their Accounts of Days nor Months unless it be on worse Accounts than I believe you were to meet about  WELL Doctor  says the Gentleman  but I am sure of the Day for I have it in my Book  NAY if it was mistaken a Day or two  says the Doctor  it matters not for as I said before I never saw her in the Fields in my Life or if I might see her among other People I am sure I never spoke to her But besides Sir I tell you this cannot be true for I was at  London  all the last Month 'till the th Day so that 'tis impossible  HERE the Discourse necessarily broke off the Gentleman was loth to discover his Surprize but told him he would enquire farther into it and upon that he goes immediately back to the Lady reproaches her a little wi  h her forming such a Story to pick a Quarrel but not telling her that he had been with the Minister at all only as he might easily know by other Circumstances that the Doctor was out of Town he told her that he would not have charg'd her with such a thing in such harsh Terms if he was not upon looking back a little upon things come to a Certainty that it was not only false but that it was impossible to be true  THEY had a long Dialogue upon that Head and as he did not presently tell her the Circumstances  thinking he had a little Advantage upon her he jested with her pretty smartly upon it seem'd to laugh that she should first put such a Sham upon him and then to tell such a formal Story to make it good and to excuse her Breach of Promise and that not a Word of Truth should be in it  SHE receiv'd his making a Jest of it with Disdain and told him she began now to discover what a kind of a Man she was so near being r  in'd by and that she had been in good Hands indeed that could pretend to banter her thus that she sho  ld have been fin  ly us'd if the good Minister had not been sent from Heaven to save her from being doubly undone  HE told her she was soon angry but it touch'd her home however Madam says he you shan't slander the good Man for he had no hand in it  WELL well says she I can better laugh at you for that Folly than I should have done for something too vile to name if I had fallen into your Hands For  says she  I had too much Reason to say now that I was sure to have been both betray'd and expos'd  HE said she grew scurrilous and went from one Story to another that she told him a false Story and wanted to drop it he desir'd her to stick to one thing and go through that first  SHE colour'd and raising her Voice told him 'twas below a Gentleman to give a Woman the Lie that she believ'd if she had been a Man he durst not have said so to her  HE told her she was mad and that she had happen'd to speak a false thing and was in a Rage because she could not come off of it  SHE told him he show'd her again that he was no Gentleman that if he gave her  the Lie  again she would spit in his Face and that if he would furnish her with a Sword she would do her sel  justice and give him Satisfaction as fairly as if she was a Man and that for his giving her the Lie she threw it back in his Face he might make the best of it  THAT'S Gallantly done  says he  Madam indeed there's a Sword for you and offers her his own laying it down upon the Table before her  YOU an't even with me yet  says she  I scorn as much to take up a Sword against a Naked Man as you ought to have scorn'd if you had been a Gentleman to give  the Lie  to a Woman  HE began now to find she was too hard for him but he came back to the Question  WELL Madam  says he  will you own your self in the wrong if I prove to you what I said just now that what you charge me with not only is false but can't be true  AY ay  says she  what can't be true must be false but what does that do for you  WELL  says he  will you venture so much upon it as  HERE she interrupted him with some warmth  says she  I'll venture my Life upon it  NO Madam not your Life  says he  you shall only oblige your self to perform your Promise if I do prove it and I'll promise never to ask you more if I do not  I CAN'T go that length again to save Life but I'll freely consent to die any Death in the World that is not by lingring Torture if you can do it  WHY then Madam  says he  you know our Appointment was such a Day so he reckon'd up the Days to her 'till she understood the Calculation and agreed that it was so  WELL it was such a Day  says she  and that Day I saw and talk'd with the Doctor in such a place  WELL Madam  says he  and that Day and all that part of the Month for several Days both before and after it  the Doctor was at London  I remember it and you shall know it by very good Circumstances such as cannot be deny'd I know it by several Particulars  HERE he related to her several Circumstances as if he knew them by his own Affairs not let  ing her know at all that he had seen the Doctor and talk'd with him about it  SHE laught at him at first and told him that he had been too old for her before but she was too old for this now that she might be imposed upon in many things but when she saw a Man that she knew and had known from a Child and talk'd with a Man she had talk'd to a thousand times and had heard Preach for almost fifteen Years he must not think to run her down with Words that she assur'd him 'twas so and there was an end of the thing  WELL Madam  says he  and you pretend he came to the House too while I was there How do you pretend to prove that  ONLY  says she  that I stood still with my Eyes open saw him at the Door saw little  Jacky G    s  the Farmer's Son open the Door to him make him a Bow saw the Doctor go in saw the Door shut to again when he was in that is all  says she  and smil'd  WELL  says he  I can only say this I will have the bottom of it out for I will not be charg'd as guilty of using you ill while I know nothing of it  NO no  says she  I don't say I am us'd ill I am us'd well very well and here she puts on an Air of Satisfaction and sings  To flee from the  Devil  's to bid him pursue  And  e  ertai  l  needs no invi  ing  But if you assail he will quickly turn Tail  For the  Devil  was never for fighting  The  Devil  can tempt but he cannot compel  He can wheedle delude and invite us  But he never would fill up his  Quota's  in Hell  If he only should Bully and Fright us  But when once we're got out of his Clutches  He rages and roars like a Bull  His Malice and Emptiness such is  And yet he's of Venom so full  The way then to deal with the Devil  Is at his own Weapons to fight him  When he sets up his Roar provoke him the more  And let him but see that you slight him  For the Devil's a Coward in Nature  A pitiful sorry Poltroon  If you take but the Whip he'll give you the Slip  And before you can lash him he'll run  HER Singing put him into a Passion for he took her Song of the  Devil  to mean himself and he told her 'twas all a scandalous Fiction of her own and she should hear more of him and so offered to go out  SHE bad him do his worst and made him a Curtsy as if she suppos'd he had been just going away and now she laught outright at him  BUT he cou'd not go away yet he told her he would not have her expose her self that she ought not to use him so and she would but force him to make her ashamed of it  SHE told him it was good Advice to bid her not expose her self and she had the more need of it because he had exposed her so much already  THEN he told  er he would bring the Farmer and all his Family to her to prove that the Doctor had not been there that Day nor for five Months before and the Boy should testify that he never saw him nor open'd the Door nor let him in  WELL Sir  says she  now you come close to the Point pray let all this be done But let me ask one thing for you to think of as you go on Do you think I know Doctorour Minister  YES Madam  says he  I believe you know him well enough and that makes me wonder at you the more  WELL and do you think my Maid  Mary  knows him  says she  YES  says he  I believe she does for she was born in the Town  WELL  says she  then I have one Witness of my side you shall hear what she says  WHY Madam  says he  was  Mary  with you  YOU shall hear presently  says she  So she rings a little Bell and in comes her Maid  Mist  Mary  don't you remember you walk'd out into the Field with me one Day last Month  Ma  WHAT when you went to Farmer  Gi  's Madam and sent me back again  Mist  YES don't you remember you would fain a gone further  Ma  YES Madam I was afraid you should go over the last Field alone  Mist  BUT what did I say to you  Mary  Ma  WHY you would make me go back by the same Token we saw our Minister Dra coming after us and you said the Doctor would  see you safe and so I came away contented when I saw him  Mist  ARE you sure 'twas the Doctor  Mary  Ma  SURE Madam yes why he spoke to me  Mist  WHAT did he say to you  Ma  HE said How d'ye do Mrs  Mary  and touch'd his Hat just as he us'd to do  WELL Sir  says she  then you see I wa'n't drunk nor I did not walk in my Sleep If it were convenient I would send for the Doctor this Minute and he should tell you what he said to me  CONVENIENT or not convenient  says he  I'll send for him or go to him for I will find it out and then he swore a little  THAT'S much about as kind as all the rest  says she  rather expose any body than your self but do your worst  the Snare is broken and I am escap'd  'twill expose your self at last  COME Madam  says he  you shall see I can talk it with the Doctor and that before your Face and yet he shall know nothing of the matter  I KNOW a little too much of that  says she  he know nothing of it and then she smil'd  THIS put him almost out of all Temper and he gave her ill Words again and at last added the whole Story and told her downright that he had talk'd with the Doctor already and that he solemnly protested he knew nothing of it and had never seen her or spoken with her for so long time naming the time when he spoke last to her likewise he told her what the Doctor said of his having been at  London  all those three Weeks when this happen'd  SHE begun to be amaz'd and a little confounded at this but recovering her self she told him that if the Doctor was there himself she had a direct answer to give him for she was not a Papist  o believe a Priest against her own Senses  WHAT answer can you give Madam  says he  when the Doctor shall prove by twenty Witnesses if need were that he was at  London  almost a hundred Mile off all the while  WHY my Answer would be this that 'twas either he or the  Devil  WELL then it was the  Devil says he  I won't dispute that with you Madam  NO no  says she  I can satisfy you that it could not be the  Devil  I can convince you you will acknowledge it presently Do you think the  Devil  would have turn'd me back again when he knew the dreadful Errand I was going on  NAY  says he calmly  I confess that's the best thing you have said yet who then cou'd it be  says he  for 'tis plain it could not be the Doctor  THEN  says she  it must be some heavenly Appearance in the Doctor's Cloaths for I knew not his Face and his Voice only but his very Gown and if it was a good Angel I have the more reason to be thankful that he hindred me from running into the Arms of the  Devil  and with that she fell a crying she could hold out no longer  WELL they parted after this Scuffle for he was a little daunted himself  BUT my Story does not end here for a little while after something happen'd that explain'd all the rest The Lady had a Visit to pay at a Neighbour's House who liv'd a little out of the Town only over one little Enclosure which she was oblig'd to cross Now as she was going over that Close or Enclosure who should she meet but the Doctor again and she saw him a good while before he came up to her  SHE was surpriz'd at seeing him and if she could have avoided him she would but 'twas impossible When he came up to he  he pull'd off his Hat very courteously and immediately began to  discourse of what he had said to her before but took no Notice at all of its having been deny'd  SIR  says she  I have been very ill us'd upon that Day's Work  I KNOW it  says he  I know it repeating the Words But your Innocence shall be cleared up I will do it my self do you be thankful that you escap'd the Snare And so giving her no time to answer he pass'd by her without taking any farewell which being a little Particular made her turn her Head to look at him But tho' it was in the middle of the Field which was too large for him to be out of it if he had flown as swift as a Pidgeon for it was not above a Moment not a Second of Time he was gone and she saw nothing  SHE was exceedingly surpriz'd and ready to sink into the Ground she was so frighted that she could not help fitting down even upon the Grass for her Joints trembled under her so that she could not stand  IT happen'd that a poor Woman of the Town came cross the Close at the very juncture and knowing her she call'd to her to come and help her up She did not tell the Woman what had happen'd to her but that she was taken with a fit of trembling and that if she had not sat down she must have fallen down all which was true so the poor Woman help'd her up and led her home where she continued very ill of the Fright for several Days  IN this time she had a very great desire to see the Gentleman for by what the Apparition said to her she made no doubt but he had seen it too  AFTER some time he had heard that she was very ill and thinking what he had said to her might have had some influence upon her to hurt her he resolv'd to go and see her for tho' he had ruffled her pretty much yet as he said afterwards  he lov'd her very well and the better for her so seasonably recovering her Vir  ue and good Principles and much better than he believ'd he should have done if he had had his Will of her as he should certainly have had if she had met him that time at the Farmer's  WITH these kind Thoughts h  went to visit her and tho' she was very ill yet she would be brought out of her Chamber to see him  AFTER some Civilities he frankly told her the reason of his Visit word for word as above and that he came to chear her up a little  SHE thank'd him but told him it was true it had extremely troubled her to think first how near she had b  en to her utter Ruin and then how needlesly she had been expos'd for it and that tho' she had no Guilt as he very well knew other than that which was in the first wicked Consenting yet she had been as much expos'd as if she had been really his Whore  HE protested to her that he never had opened his Lips of it to the Doctor or any one else and that it was the Resentment at the charging him with it that had made him so angry and nothing else for that he scorn'd any thing so base  SHE told him it was impossible for any one to believe otherwise before but that she believ'd he was satisfied how it all was now and that something had happen'd since which had open'd her Eyes tho' it had almost kill'd her and she believ'd he knew something of it too  HE wanted to know what it was for he protested he knew nothing What  says he  is there any more Mysteries  SHE said  she could not tell him because she suppos'd he would not believe her  HE answer'd  he would believe her in every thing that he ought to believe any body in  SHE told him  she believ'd there would be no occasion to tell him for that she did not doubt but he would be inform'd the same way that she was if he was not already  HE importun'd her earnestly to let him know what it was and that with such a serious kind of Discourse that she fancy'd he had seen something too but it seems he had not However he entreated her so much that at last she let him know the whole Story as above  THER  is a great deal more belongs to this Story which would be very diverting and not without its Uses too but as the particular Relation does not come within the verge of my own Knowledge I cannot vouch all the Particulars at least not sufficiently  HOWEVER 'tis enough to the Case in hand If the Apparition came to prevent this poor deluded young Lady from prostituting her self to a Man that had wheedled her in upon such dishonourable Terms it could not certainly be the  Devil  or any Spirit of his Class or under his Government and Direction he would never have exhorted her to go back reproach'd her with the Crime and prevail'd upon her to believe it had been reveal'd to him by the Treachery of her Lover  THIS must be certainly one of those Angelick Guards which the God of Nature in Mercy to Mankind has placed as a detach'd Body of Spirits to counteract the  Devil  prevent the Archenemy seducing his Creatures and overwhelming the World with Crime and if the Story be as I have receiv'd it and now handed it down it seems a merciful Disposition of Providence in Favour of the Gentleman as well as the Lady and be it a Parable or a History the Moral is the same and the Improvement of it the same too They that are  unning the same Course of Folly would have Reason  to be very thankful if they were sure to meet with the same kind of Disappointment and would never say it was the  Devil  that told it them  THE Gentleman it seems did not slight the Story so much as she expected he would nor did he question the Truth of any or every Part of it for she told it with so much Steadiness always agreeing in every Particular and gave so concurring Accounts of the Circumstances as they related to what had happened before that it was apparent 'twas no Delusion  THAT which made him most uneasy was that the Apparition seem'd to promise to appear to him and he had no Desire to be convinc'd that way Indeed the Story at least so far as I have the Particulars breaks off a little abruptly there and does not say whether he ever saw any thing or no But it said it made him be quite another Man in his Way of living than ever he was before and particularly he was very thankful that he had been prevented being so wicked with her as in all Probability he had been if this had not happen'd  NOW this Apparition as is said above could not with any manner of Reason be supposed to be the  Devil  for why should an  Evil Spirit  appear to keep any Person from doing Evil Why should it assume a real Shape namely that of a Minister in his Gown and Cassock and that it was in Appearance the very Minister of the Parish for all this she constantly affirm'd and t  o things are natural Inferences from it  FIRST  That the Appearance was real  SECONDLY  That it was a good Spirit  LET the Divines read us Lectures upon the Nature of Spirits and upon how far they can or cannot take Cognizance of human Affairs That I have nothing to do with here my Business is to observe the Matter of Fact  viz  that they do come  hither do appear and are seen talk'd to and convers'd with and that they do come on good Errands and therefore are not likely to be evil Spirits or  Devils  TAKE another Historical Relation which tho' I name no Names I have very good Authority for the Truth of and that more particularly than for the other  A GENTLEMAN of a very good Estate married a Lady of also a good Fortune and had one Son by her and one Daughter and no more and after a few Years his Lady died He soon married a second Venter and his second Wife tho' of an inferior Quality and Fortune to the former took upon her to discourage and discountenance his Children by his first Lady and made the Family very uncomfortable both to the Children and to their Father also  THE first thing of Consequence which this Conduct of the MotherinLaw produced in the Family was that the Son who began to be a Man ask'd the Father's Leave to go abroad to travel The MotherinLaw tho' willing enough to be rid of the young Man yet because it would require something considerable to support his Expences abroad violently oppos'd it and brought his Father also to refuse him after he had freely given him his Consent  THIS so affected the young Gentleman that after using all the dutiful Applications to his Father that he could possibly do as well by himself as by some other Relations but to no purpose and being a little encouraged by an Uncle who was Brother to his Mother his Father's first Lady he resolv'd to go abroad without Leave and accordingly did so  WHAT Part of the World he travelled into I do not remember it seems his Father had constantly Intelligence from him for some time and was prevail'd with to make him a reasonable Allowance  for his Subsistance which the young Gentleman always drew Bills for and they were honourably paid but after some time the MotherinLaw prevailing at home one of his Bills of Exchange was refus'd and being protested was sent back without Acceptance upon which he drew no more nor did he write any more Letters or his Father hear any thing from him for upwards of four Years or thereabouts  UPON this long Silence the MotherinLaw made her Advantage several Ways she first intimated to his Father that he must needs be dead and consequently his Estate should be settled upon her eldest Son for she had several Children His Father withstood the Motion very firmly but the Wife harr  ss'd him with her Importunities and she argued upon two Points against him I mean the Son  FIRST  If he was dead then there was no room to object her Son being Heir at Law  SECONDLY  If he was not dead his Behaviour to his Father in not writing for so long a Time was inexcusable and he ought to resent it and settle the Estate as if he were dead that nothing could be more disobliging and his Father ought to depend upon it that he was dead and treat him as if he was so for he that would use a Father so should be taken for one dead as to his filial Relation and be treated accordingly  HIS Father however stood out a long time and told her that he could not answer it to his Conscience that there might happen many things in the World which might render his Son unable to write that he might be taken by the  Turks  and carried into Slavery or he migh  be among the  Persians  or  Arabians  which it seems was the Cafe and so could not get any Letters convey'd and that he could not be satisfied to disinherit him  'till he knew whether he had Reason for it or no or whether his Son had offended him or no  THESE Answers however just were far from stopping her Importunities which she carried on so far that she gave him no Rest and it made an unquiet Family she carried it very ill to him and in a word made her Children do so too and the Gentleman was so wearied out with it that once or twice he came to a kind of Consent to do it but his Heart fail'd him and then he fell back again and refused  HOWEVER her having brought him so near it was an Encouragement to her to go on with her restless Sollicitations 'till at last he came thus far to a provisional Agreement that if he did not hear from his Son by such a time or before it he would consent to a resettling the Estate  SHE was not well satisfied with the conditional Agreement but being able to obtain no other she was oblig'd to accept of it as 'twas tho' as she often told him she was far from being satisfied with it as to the Time for he had fix'd it for four Years as above  HE grew angry at her telling him so and answer'd that she ought to be very well satisfied with it for that it was time little enough as his Son's Circumstances might be  WELL she teiz'd him however so continually that at last she brought him down to one Year But before she brought him to that she told him one Day in a Heat that she hoped his Ghost would one time or other appear to him and tell him that he was dead and that he ought to do Justice to his other Children for he should never come to claim the Estate  WHEN he came so much against his Will to consent to shorten the time to one Year he told her that he hoped his Son's Ghost tho' he was  not dead would come to her and tell her he was alive before the Time expired For why says he may not injur'd Souls walk while embodied as well as afterwards  IT happen'd one Evening after this that they had a most violent Family Quarrel upon this Subject when on a sudden a Hand appeared at a Casement endeavouring to open it but as all the iron Casements used in former Times open'd outward but hasp'd or fasten'd themselves in the Inside so the Hand seem'd to try to open the Casement but could not The Gentleman did not see it but his Wife did and she presently started up as if she was frighted and forgetting the Quarrel they had upon their Hands Lord bless me  says she  there are Thieves in the Garden Her Husband ran immediately to the Door of the Room they sat in and opening it look'd out  THERE'S no body in the Garden  says he  so he clapt the Door again and came back  I AM sure  says she  I saw a Man there  IT must be the  Devil  then  says he  for I'm sure there's no body in the Garden  I'LL swear  says she  I saw a Man put his Hand up to open the Casement but finding it fast and I suppose  adds she  seeing us in the Room he walk'd off  IT is impossible he could be gone  says he  did not I run to the Door immediately and you know the Garden Walls on both sides hinder him going  PRY'THEE  says she angrily  I an't drunk nor in a Dream I know a Man when I see him and 'tis not dark the Sun is not quite down  YOU'RE only frighted with Shadows  says he very full of Illnature  Folks generally are so that are haunted with an evil Conscience it may be 'twas the  Devil  NO no I'm not soon frighted  says she  if 'twas the  Devil  'twas the Ghost of your Son it may be come to tell you he was gone to the  Devil  and you might give your Estate to your eldest Bastard since you won't settle it on the lawful Heir  IF it was my Son  says he  he's come to tell us he's alive I warrant you and to ask you how you can be so much a  Devil  to desire me to disinherit him and with those Words  Alexander says he aloud  repeating it twice starting up out of his Chair if you are alive show your self and don't let me be insulted thus every Day with your being dead  AT those very Words the Casement which the Hand had been seen at by the Mother open'd of itself and his Son  Alexander  look'd in with a full Face and staring directly upon the Mother with an angry Countenance cry'd  Here  and then vanish'd in a Moment  THE Woman that was so stout before shriek'd out in a most dismal manner so as alarm'd the whole House her Maid ran into the Parlour to see what was the matter but her Mistress was fainted away in her Chair  SHE was not fallen upon the Ground because it being a great easie Chair she sunk a little back against the side of the Chair and Help coming immediately in they kept her up but it was not 'till a great while after that she recover'd enough to be sensible of any thing  HER Husband run immediately to the Parlour Door and opening it went into the Garden but there was nothing and after that he run to another Door that open'd from the House into the Garden and then to two other Doors which open'd out of his Garden one into the Stableyard and another into the Field beyond the Garden but found  them all fast shut and barr'd but on one side was his Gardener and a Boy drawing the Rollingstone he ask'd them if any body else had been in the Garden but they both constantly affirmed no body had been there and they were both rolling a Gravelwalk near the House  UPON this he comes back into the Room sits him down again and said not one Word for a good while the Women and Servants being busy all the while and in a Hurry endeavouring to recover his Wife  AFTER some time she recover'd so far as to speak and the first Words she said  Ld bless me what was it  NAY says her Husband 'twas  Alexander  to be sure  WITH that she sell into a Fit and skream'd and shriek'd out  gain most terribly  HER Husband not thinking that would have  ffected her did what he could to persuade her out of it again but that would not do and they were oblig'd to carry her to Bed and get some help to her but she continued very ill for several Days after  HOWEVER this put an end for some considerable time to her Sollicitations about his Disinheriting her SoninLaw  BUT Time that hardens the Mind in cases of a worse Nature wore this off also by degrees and she began to revive the old Cause again tho' not at first so eagerly as before  NAY he us'd her a little hardly upon ittoo and  f ever th  y had any Words about it he would bid her hold her Tongue or that if she talked any more upon that Subject he would call  Alexand  r  again to open the Casement  THIS aggravated Things much and tho' it terrify'd her a great while yet at length she was so  exasperated that she told him she believ'd he dealt with the  Devil  and that he had sold himself to the  Devil  only to be able to fright his Wife  HE jested with her and told her any Man wou'd be beholden to the  Devil  to hush a noisy Woman and that he was very glad he had found the Way to do it whatever it cost him  SHE was so exasperated at this that she threaten'd him if he play'd any more of his hellish Arts with her she wou'd have him Indicted for a Wizard and having a Familiar and she could prove it she said plain enough for that he had rais'd the  Devil  on purpose to fright his Wife  THE Fray parted that Night with ill Words and ill Nature enough but he little thought she intended as she said and the next Day he had forgot it all and was as goodhumour'd as if nothing had happened  BUT he found his Wife chagreen'd and disturbed very much full of Resentment and threatning him with what she resolv'd to do  HOWEVER he little thought she intended him the Mischief she had in her Head offering to talk friendly to her but she rejected it with Scorn and told him she would be as good as her Word for she wou'd not live with a Man that should bring the  Devil  into the Room as often as he thought fit to murther his Wife  HE strove to pacify her by fair Words but she told him she was in earnest with him and in a Word she was in earnest for she goes away to a Justice and making an Affidavit that her Husband had a Familiar Spirit and that she went in Danger of her Life she obtain'd a Warrant for him to be apprehended  IN short she brought home the Warrant shew'd it him and told him she had not given it into the Hands of an Officer because he should have  the Liberty to go voluntarily before the Justice of the Peace and if he thought fit to let her know when he would be ready she would be so too and would get some of her own Friends to go along with her  HE was surpriz'd at this for he little thought she had been in earnest with him and endeavour'd to pacify her by all the Ways possible but she found she had frighted him heartily and so indeed she had for tho' the thing had nothing in it of Guilt yet he found it might expose him very much and being loth to have such a Thing brought upon the Stage against him he used all the Entreaties with her that he was able and begged her not to do it  BUT the more he humbled himself the more she triumph'd over him and carrying Things to an unsufferable height of Insolence she told him at last she would make him do Justice as she call'd it that she was sure she cou'd have him punish'd if he continu'd obstinate and she wou'd not be expos'd to Witchcraft and Sorc  ry for she did not know to what length he might carry it  TO bring the Story to a Conclusion she got the better of him to such a degree that he offer'd to refer the thing to indifferent Persons Friends on both Sides and they met several Times but could bring it to no Conclusion His Friends said there was nothing in it and they would not have him comply with any thing upon the Pretence of it that he called for his Son and some body open'd the Casement and cry'd  here  that there was not the least Evidence of Witchcraft in that and insisted that she cou'd make nothing of it  HER Friends carried it high instructed by her She offer'd to swear that he had threatned her before with his Son's Ghost that now he visibly rais'd  a Spectre for that calling upon his Son who was dead to be sure the Ghost immediately appear'd that he could not have called up the  Devil  thus to personate his Son if he had not dealt with the  Devil  himself and had a familiar Spirit and that this was of dangerous Consequence to her  UPON the whole the Man wanted Courage to stand it and was afraid of being expos'd so that he was grievously perplex'd and knew not what to do  WHEN she found him humbled as much as she cou'd desire she told him if he would do her Justice as she call'd it that is to say settle his Estate upon her Son she would put it up on Condition that he should promise to fright her no more with raising the  Devil  THAT part of the Proposal exasperated him again and he upbraided her with the Slander of it and told her he defy'd her and she might do her worst  THUS it broke off all Treaty and she began to threaten him again however at length she brought him to comply and he gives a Writing under his Hand to her some of her Friends being by promising that he would comply if his Son did not arrive or send an Account of himself within four Months  SHE was satisfy'd with this and they were all made Friends again and accordingly he gave the Writing but when he deliver'd it to her in Presence of her two Arbitrators he took the Liberty to say to her with a grave and solemn kind of Speech  LOOK you says he you have worry'd me into this Agreement by your fiery Temper and I have sign'd it against Justice Conscience and Reason but depend upon it I shall never perform it  ONE of the Arbitrators said Why Sir this is doing nothing for if you resolve not to perform it what signifies the Writing Why do you promise what you do not intend shall be done This will but kindle a new Flame to begin with when the Time fix'd expires  WHY  says he  I am satisfy'd in my Mind that my Son is alive  COME come  says his Wife  speaking to the Gentleman that had argued with her Husband let him sign the Agreement and let me alone to make him perform the Conditions  WELL  says her Husband  you shall have the Writing and you shall be let alone but I am satisfy'd you will never ask me to perform it and yet I am no Wizard adds he as you have wickedly suggested  SHE reply'd that she would prove that he dealt with the  Devil  for that he rais'd an evil Spirit by only calling his Son by his Name and so began to tell the Story of the Hand and the Casement  COME says the Man to the Gentleman that was her Friend give me the Pen I never dealt with but one  Devil  in my Life and there it sits turning to his Wife and now I have made an Agreement with her that none but the  Devil  wou'd desire any Man to sign and I will sign it I say give me the Pen but she nor all the  Devils  in Hell will ever be able to get it executed remember I say so  SHE began to open at him and so a new Flame  ould have been kindled but the Gentlemen mo  erated between them and her Husband setting  is Hand to the Writing put an end to the Fray  t that time  AT the end of four Months she challeng'd the  erformance and a Day was appointed and her two  riends that had been the Arbitrators were invited  to Dinner upon this Occasion believing that he Husband would have executed the Deeds and accordingly the Writings were brought all forth engross'd and read over and some old Writings which at her Marriage were sign'd by her Trustees in order to her quitting some part of the Estate to her Son were also brought to be cancell'd The Husband being brought over by fair Means or foul I know not whether to be in a Humour for Peace sake to execute the Deeds and disinherit his Son alledging that indeed if he was dead it was no wrong to him and if he was alive he was very unkind and undutiful to his Father in not letting him hear from him in all that time  BESIDES it was urg'd that if he should at any time afterwards appear to be alive his Father who had very much encreas'd it seems in his Wealth was able to give him another Fortune and to make him a just Satisfaction for the Loss he should sustain by the Paternal Estate  UPON these Considerations I say they had brought over the poor lowspirited Husband to be almost willing to comply or at least willing or unwilling it was to be done and as above they me  accordingly  WHEN they had discoursed upon all the Particulars and as above the new Deeds were read over she or her Husband took the old Writings up to cancel them I think the Story says it was the Wife not her Husband that was just going to tear off the Seal when on a sudden they heard a rushing Noise in the Parlour where they sat as if some body had come in at the Door of the Room which opened from the Hall and went thro' the Room towards the Garden Door which was shut  THEY were all surpriz'd at it for it was very distinct but they saw nothing The Woman turn'd pale and was in a terrible Fright however  as nothing was seen she recover'd a little but began to ruffle her Husband again  WHAT says she have you laid your Plot to bring up more Devils again  THE Man sat compos'd tho' he was under no little Surprize too  ONE of her Gentlemen said to him What is the meaning of all this  I PROTEST Sir says he I know no more of it than you do  WHAT can it be then  said the other Gentleman  I CANNOT conceive  says he  for I am utterly unacquainted with such Things  HAVE you heard nothing from your Son says the Gentleman  NOT one Word  says the Father  no not the least Word these five Years  HAVE you wrote nothing to him  says the Gentleman  about this Transaction  NOT a Word says he for I know not where to direct a Letter to him  SIR  says the Gentleman  I have heard much of Apparitions but I never saw any in my Life nor did I ever believe there was any thing of Reality in them and indeed I saw nothing now but the passing of some Body or Spirit or something cross the Room just now is plain I heard it distinctly I believe there is some unseen Thing in the Room as much as if I saw it  NAY  says the other Arbitrator  I felt the Wind of it as it pass'd by me Pray adds he turning to the Husband do you see nothing yourself  NO upon my Word  says he  not the least Appearance in the World  I HAVE been told says the first Arbitrator and h  ve Read that an Apparition may be seen by some  People and be Invisible to others tho' all in the same Room together  HOWEVER the Husband solemnly protested to them all that he saw nothing  PRAY Sir  says the first Arbitrator  have you seen any thing at any other time or heard any Voices or Noises or had any Dreams about this Matter  INDEED  says he  I have several times dream'd my Son is alive and that I had spoken with him and once that I ask'd him why he was so undutiful and slighted me so as not to let me hear of him in so many Years seeing he knew it was in my Power to disinherit him  WELL Sir and what Answer did he give  I NEVER dream'd so far on as to have him answer it always wak  d me  AND what do you think of it yourself  says the Arbitrator  do you think he is dead  NO indeed  says the Father  I do believe in my Conscience he is alive as much as I believe I am alive myself and I am going to do as wicked a thing of its Kind as ever any Man did  TRULY says the second Arbitrator it begins to shock me I don't know what to say to it I don't care to meddle any more with it I don't like driving Men to act against their Consciences  WITH this the Wife who as I said having a little recover'd her Spirits and especially encourag'd because she saw nothing started up What's all this Discourse to the purpose  says she  is it not all agreed already what do we come here for  NAY  says the first Arbitrator  I think we meet now not to enquire into why it is done but to execute Things according to Agreement and what are we frighted at  I'M not frighted  says the Wife  not I come says she to her Husband haughtily sign the Deed I'll cancel the old Writings if forty  Devils  were in  the Room and with that she takes up one of the Deeds and went to tear off the Seal  THAT Moment the same Casement flew open again tho' it was fast in the Inside just as it was before and the Shadow of a Body was seen as standing in the Garden without and the Head reaching up to the Casement the Face looking into the Room and staring directly at the Woman with a stern and an angry Countenonce HOLD said the Spectre as if speaking to the Woman and immediately clap'd the Casement to again and vanish'd  IT is impossible to describe here the Consternation this second Apparition put the whole Company into the Wife who was so bold just before that she wou'd do it tho' forty  Devils  were in the Room skream'd out like a Woman in Fits and let the Writing fall out of her Hands The two Arbitrators were exceedingly terrify'd but not so much as the rest but one of them took up the Award which they had sign'd in which they awarded the Husband to execute the Deed to dispose of the Estate from the Son  I DARE say said he be the Spirit a good Spirit or a bad it will not be against cancelling this so he tore his Name out of the Award and so did the other by his Example and both of them got up from their Seats and said they would have no more to do in it  BUT that which was most unexpected of all was that the Man himself was so frighted that he fainted away notwithstanding it was as it might be said in his favour  THIS put an end to the whole Affair at that time and as I understand by the Sequel it did so for ever  THE Story has many Particulars more in it too long to trouble you with but two Particulars  which are to the Purpofe I must not omit  Viz  THAT in about four or five Months more after this second Apparition the Man's Son arriv'd from the  EastIndies  whither he had gone four Years before in a  Portugueze  Ship from  Lisbon  THAT upon being particularly enquired of about these Things and especially whether he had any Knowledge of them or any Apparition to him or Voices or other Intimation as to what was doing in  England  relating to him he affirmed constantly that he had not except that once he dreamed his Father had written him an angry Letter threatning him that if he did not come home he would disinherit him and leave him not one Shilling But he added that he never did receive any such Letter from his Father in his Life or from any one else  CHAP IX More Relations of particular Facts proving the Reality of Apparitions with some just Observations on the Difference between the good and evil Spirits from the Errand or Business they come about  I MAKE no Remarks upon any of these Stories the present Business is to bring Examples of such Things to prove the Reality of Apparitions in general As to who or what it is that in such cases may appear and why and upon what Occasions that we shall speak of hereafter  I SHALL bring one Example now within my own Knowledge and in which I had some Concern  not but that other Accounts may be as authentick as this tho' I cannot so positively vouch them at second or third Hand When I offer those to you therefore I tell you honestly that I have such and such Relations from good Hands or I have such a Story by me in Manuscript and I leave you to make such use of them as you please  THIS Caution of mine however ought not to lessen the Credit of any of the Relations here publish'd for why may not the Account given by another Hand be as true as this which I give you from my own Knowledge and why must an Author in such cases as these be made answer  ble for the Particulars of every History or be bound to leave it out which would be the Reader's Loss not his own  HOWEVER the following I can vouch from my own Knowledge  A B  was a Merchant in  London  and as he drove a considerable Trade beyondsea he establish'd a Factor or as the Language of Trade calls it a HOUSE at a certain Port in the  English  Colonies in  America  and sent over his Servants or Apprentices thither as is usual for Merchants to do  ONE of his said Apprentices being fitted out and ready to Embark his Cargo being actua  ly on board the Ship and the Ship fallen down the River as far as  Gravesend  his Master was getting his Letters and Invoyces and other Dispatches ready for him he being to go down the River the same Evening  THE Hurry which thus dispatching him put his Master into occasion'd that when he was call'd to Dinner at the usual Hour he did not take the young Gentleman with him as usual but told him he must be content to stay in the Countinghouse 'till he came to relieve him  ACCORDINGLY Dinner being over he goes down to send him up to Dinner And when he came to the Countinghouse Door there sat his Man with the Bookkeeper also writing as he left him  IT happen'd just that Moment some occasion extraordinary oblig'd him to step back again and go up Stairs to the DiningRoom from whence he came and intending not to stay he did not speak to the young Man but left him in the Countinghouse and went immediately up Stairs  IT was not possible that he or any one else except such as could walk invisible could go by or pass him unseen Good Manners would have hinder'd the young Man from thrusting by his Master upon the Stairs if he had been going up but he is positive he did not and cou'd not pass without being seen  BUT when he came to the top of the Stairs there sat the young Man at Dinner with the other Servants the Room they din'd in being a little Parlour which open'd just against the Stairs so that he saw him all the way of the upper Part of the Staircase and could not be deceived  THE Master did not speak to him which he was very sorry for afterwards but the Surprize made him pass by the Room and go into the DiningRoom which was to the right Hand of it but he sent one immediately to look and he was there really at Dinner so that what he the Master saw below in the Countinghouse must be the Apparition as it certainly was  BUT this was not all The young Gentleman embark'd as above and arriv'd safe with all his Effects in  America  tho' he never liv'd to return However I cannot say his Apparition in the manner as related could have the least Relation to his being sick and dying abroad which was not 'till three  Years afterwards But what follow'd was of another kind  THIS young Man had an elder Brother who liv'd in  London  he was a fine Gentleman and a Scholar and was at that time studying Physick He was also a stout brave Gentleman and in particular understood a Sword that is to say how to use a Sword as well as most Gentlemen in  England  HE had an accidental Rencounter with a Gentleman in the Street in that short Street which goes out of  Fleetstreet  into  SalisburyCourt  and being so compleat a Master of his Weapon he wounded his Antagonist and drove him into a Tavern in the Street from whence came out two Men more upon him with their Swords but both of them found the Gentleman so much an Overmatch for them that they left him as fast as the first whereupon a fourth came out not with a Sword but a FireFork taken hastily up out of the Tavern Kitchen and running at this Gentleman with it knock'd him down and broke his Skull of which Wound he afterwards died  WHILE this was done in  London  his Brother as far off as  Boston  in  NewEngland  writing to his Master the Merchant and who gives this Account of it after other Business writ this Postscript  SIR I beg you will be pleas'd in your Return to this to let me have some Account as much as conveniently may be of how my Brother does and what Condition he is in which you will excuse my Importunity for when you read the following Account  viz  THE    th oflast about six a Clock in the Morning lying in my Bed and broad awake my Brother or an Apparition of my Brother came to the Bed's Feet and open'd the Curtain looking full in my Face but did not speak I was very much frighted but  however I so far recover'd as to say to him Brother what is the matter with you  HE had a NapkinCap on his Head which was very bloody he look'd very pale and ghastly and said I am basely murther'd bynaming the Person but I shall have Justice done me and then disappear'd  NOW this Letter was so dated that it was impossible any Account could be sent of the Disaster that could reach thither in that time for it was not dated above fourteen Days after the Fact was committed in  London  and that it was Genuine I am well assur'd because I saw the Letter within an Hour after it was receiv'd in  London  read it my self and knew the young Man's Hand and the young Man also perfectly well as I did his Brother that was kill'd also very intimately  THE young Man was sober religious and sensible not given to Whimsie or lightheaded Fancies not vapourish or distemper'd not apt to see double or to dream waking as many of our Apparitionmaking People are he was besides that a Scholar and very serious the first I mention as a Protection to him from foolish Imagination and the last from Falshood and I am satisfy'd the Reader may depend upon both the Stories I mean as to the Truth of them  IN my speaking of Apparitions as I have stated the Case I must take leave to differ from the Notions of the Ancients who 'tis evident understood all Apparition to be the Souls or as we call them the Ghosts of departed Persons but when they came to make rational Conclusions from those first Opinions What wild Additions were they driven to make to the first just Conceptions which they had form'd in their Minds  THEIR first Conceptions  I say  were indeed just consistent with Reason and with Nature for they concluded that when the Body is dead and the Soul separated the State was determin'd This Mr  Pope  expresses very well in his Translation of  Homer  For to the farther Shore  When once we pass the Soul returns no more  THIS was I say a rational and just Sentiment but then they were confounded in all those Imaginations by seeing the Apparitions of their departed Friends as if come back from those eternal Shades and how to reconcile this they did not know  TO get over this Difficulty they were driven to strange Shifts and some of them it must be confess'd were very foolish ones such as these  THAT the Soul wandered about in the Air 'till such time as the Body obtain'd its due Funeral Rites from this Notion the Friends of the de  ased were mightily concern'd to see the Funeral Pile erected for their departed Friends and to have the Body honourably burn'd then the Ashes of the Bones were deposited in an Urn and that Urn bury'd in the Earth when this was done the Soul was admitted to pass the Flood that is to be transported into the  Elysian  Fields from whence they never should return any more but in case these Rites were not perform'd for any Person the Soul wander'd restless and unfix'd in a state of Perplexity for an hundred Years Hence those Lines in  Virgil  Aeneid vi  Hae  omnis quam c  rnis inops inhumataque turba est  Portitor ille Charon hi quos veluit unda sepulti  Nec ripas datur horrendas nec rauca fluenta  Transportare prius quam sedibus ossa quierunt  Centum errant annos volitantque haec littora circum  Tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt  Aeneid lib vi line  NOW between this Time or during this Interval that is to say between Death and the Funeral Pile they pretended they allow'd the separated or unembodied Souls of Men might appear and visit their Friends or harrass their Enemies and on this Occasion the Ghost of  Patroclus  slain by  Hector  at the Siege of  Troy  is brought in visiting his Friend  Achilles  and begging of him to get his Funeral Rites perform'd that he might be admitted to Rest  Thus the Phantosm said  Sleeps my  Achilles  his  Patroclus  dead  Living I seem'd his dearest tendrest Care  But now forgot I wander in the Air  Let my pale Corse the Rites of Burial know  And give me Entrance in the Shades below  'Till then the Spirit finds no Restingplace  But here and there th' unbodied Spectres  ace  The Vagrant Dead  Iliad lib xxiii    HOMER  's Notion of the State of the Dead was something like the ancient Philosophy of the  Aegyptians  which gave the Soul a Shape like the Body and that it was only a Receptacle of the Mind the Mind they made to be the sublime and superior Part and that only  THUS in the Case of Apparitions they allow'd that this Case or Shell call'd the Soul might appear after Death but the Mind could not but was exalted among the Gods and took up its Eternal Abode from whence  "It could return no more  THUS the Ghost of  Patroclus  going with his Speech to  Achilles  says thus  When once the last the Funeral Flames ascend  No more shall meet  Achilles  and his Friend  No more our Thoughts to those we love make known  THIS last Notion tho' gross and absurd in it self was the utmost Refuge they had by which to solve the Difficulty of Apparitions They imagin'd that the Soul was not only separated by Death from the Body but that there was a Separation of the Understanding from its Case or Vehicle as they call'd it so that the Soul which was but the Image and Form of the Body might be in Hell the Body it self burnt to Ashes remain'd in the Urn and the Understanding or Mind which was the sublime divine Part be in Heaven with the Gods This  Homer  expresses thus  'Tis certain Man tho' dead retains  Part of himself the immortal Mind remains  The Form subsists without the Body's Aid  Aerial Semblance and an empty Shade  AGAIN he explains it in his  Odyssey  lib xi line speaking in the Name of  Ulysses  Now I the Strength of  Hercules  behold  A Towring Spectre of Gygantick Mould  A shadowy Form For high in Heav'n's Abodes  Himself resides a God among the Gods  HERE  Homer  fancies  Hercules  that is the Mind the sublime Part of  Hercules  was in Heaven and exalted there to the highest Degree too  A  God  among the  Gods  and yet at the same time his Soul his  or Image was in Hell And  Plutarch  gives us the same Description at large  WHAT learned Nonsense and what a great deal of it is here to reconcile a thing which upon the Christian Foundation is made as easie as any thing not immediately visible to the common Eye can be made  NATURE dictated and Reason confirm'd that the first Principle namely the Soul or as they call it the Mind or Understanding fled to Heaven immediately after Death and return'd no more  THUS  Andromache  mourning for the Loss of her Husband  Hector  is brought in speaking according to the Doctrine of the Ancients  Thou to the dismal Realms  for ever  gone  And I abandon'd  THE Dead once pass'd to the  dismal Realms  as they call'd the Shades below were  gone for ever  and to return no more but then they were perplex'd to find that they did return as in this Case of  Patroclus  to  Achilles  tho' that by the way was a Dream only not an Apparition or as we may call it an Apparition in a Dream and no more  BUT they had their Apparitions and we read of many Apparitions of the Dead to the Living as particularly in the famous Example of  Caesar  appearing to  Brutus  and this perplex'd them so that they knew not how to support the Principle of the Soul not returning under the Experience of Souls actually returning in Apparition visiting and conversing with their Friends which was incontestible daily Experience making it known to all Parties  TO reconcile this they fled to Invention and first to that of the Interval between the Death and  the Funeral of the departed Souls of which before  BUT this is liable to so many just Exceptions so many Absurdities that it could not satisfie Men of Sense for first they were obliged to say and prove which would be very difficult that none of the Souls of the Dead ever appear'd after the Funeral Rites were solemnized which if one Example had contradicted all the Arguments in the World could not then have supported the Fiction and this I cannot doubt was contradicted on many Occasions  AND this no doubt made the ancient System of the  Aegyptians  be reviv'd and pass better among them afterwards tho' whether the  Romans  receiv'd it or no we do not find ascertain'd in any Part of their History  BESIDES there was an Absurdity in the very Doctrine it self for if the Apparition of a departed Soul was limited by this Circumstance of burning the Body or performing the Funeral Rites it put the State of the Dead in that particular Respect into the Power of the Living  for Example  If the Living who had Possession of the dead Bodies of Persons slain suppose them Friends had Poss  ssion of the Body the Soul of that Body tho' unembodied and dismiss'd could not be admitted to rest or as they express'd it could not pass into the Shades or R  alms below so if the Enemy had Possession of the Body it was in the Power of the Enemy to keep the Soul out of Heaven an Absurdity so gross one would think the wiser Heathens could never entertain such a Thought Yet that such it was the Words of  Patroclus  's Ghost quoted from  Homer  makes evident  Let my pale Corse the Rites of Burial know  And give me Entrance in the Shades below  UNHAPPY  Patroclus  How gross would this sound how harsh and unmusical in our Times when Christianity has given us more just  Ideas  of things  Patroclus  could not get leave to go to the Shades below 'till his Funeral Rites were perform'd that is in our Sense could not be admitted no not into Hell it self 'till his Body was burn'd on the Funeral Pile or Pyre and his Ashes deposited in an Urn that is buried like a Gentleman  BY which Rule the Souls of those poor Creatures who were killed in the Wars and were left unburied in Heaps in the Field or only a Pile of Stones thrown upon them as was often the Case are wandring still and neither admitted into Heaven or Hell  AGAIN it was in the Power of the Enemy if he had a Body in Possession to preserve his Hatred against that Enemy even beyond Death and by keeping him unburied keep his Soul or Spirit suspended wandring and forgotten in the Air and neither admitted to one or other Place whether above or below  THUS  Achilles  had the Body of  Hector  in his Power twelve Days and  Homer  brings him in triumphing over his Enemy in that case and in a manner unworthy of a Man of Honour When he speaks to the Ghost of his Friend  Patroclus  and vows to sacrifice twelve  Trojan  Prisoners at his Funeral Pile he adds  Achilles'  Promise is compleat  The bloody  Hector  stretch'd before thy Feet  Lo to  he Dogs his Carcase I resign  Gloomy he said and horrible in View  Before the Bier the bleeding  Hector  threw  Prone on the Dust  Iliad lib xxiii line  So again  Achilles  mourning over the Body of  Patroclus  as it lay on the Funeral Pile and the Fire not yet kindled I say there again he threatens to deny  Hector  a Soldier's Burial  But heavier Fates on  Hector  's Corse attend  Kept from the Flames for hungry Dogs to rend  THIS was a terrible Curse and very cruel to poor  Hector  after he was dead not to suffer his Soul to enter into the Shades below which would be to speak it in our Language not to give him leave to go to Hell that the Gods it seems thwarted  Achilles  and would not let his Cruelty take place but he was oblig'd to grant  Priam  a Truce and let the  Trojans  bury him  So spake he threatning But the Gods made vain  His Threat and guard inviolate the Slain  Celestial  Venus  hover'd o'er his Head  And roseat Unguents heavenly Fragrance shed  She watch'd him all the Night and all the Day  And drove the Bloodhounds from their destin'd Prey  SO that the Burying of  Hector  was made the Care of the Gods defeating the cruel Vengeance of  Achilles  TO what Length did this foolish Notion of the Ancients carry this Point putting it into the Power of a Man's Enemy to keep his Soul out of Heaven too as long as his Enemy thought fit to keep the Body out of the Grave  HAPPY it is for us in these malicious Days that it is otherwise here when not Enemies only but even cruel Creditors might arrest the dead Body of their Debtor and even send the Soul of him to the  Devil  or keep it hovering and wandring in the Air 'till their Debts were paid As Times go now and  as Charity stands now rated among us no poor Debtor could be at Rest any more after he was Dead than he could before 'till his Debts were all paid  NAY tho' it had pleas'd a merciful Father to forgive him his Sins and as we allow it's possible in spi  e of the cruel  TS  that a Brankrupt may die in the State of a pardoned Penitent yet I say 'till the Debt was paid the more inexorable Creditor should refuse to let him be admitted into Heaven 'till he was paid the utmost Farthing  I MUST confess if this were the Case among us I believe it would be the hardest thing in the World to get a poor Bankrupt's Composition accepted or his Certificate signed for if it was in the Power of the Creditors to send their Debtors to the  Devil  I should be apt to say with the Disciples of our Lord  Who then shall be saved  HOW often do we find a Creditor give it for an Answer when a solliciting Friend comes begging him to compound and to accept the utmost Shilling that the Debtor has to offer How often  I say  do we find the cruel Creditor reply  No not I I'll sign none of it the  Devil  shall have him before I'll sign it  NAY if his Soul was to hover in the Air as the Ancients fancy'd 'till the Body was buried I question whether they would let the Debtor go either to Heaven or Hell 'till they had their Money especially if the hovering or wandering in the Air was a worse Condition as I don't know but while the  Devils  are said to be there it may  BUT to return to the Ancients and their Notion of Futurity and of Souls departed the Difficulty as I have observed was very perplexing They granted that after the Souls of Men were once determined and transported in  Charon  's Ferryboat to the other side of the River  Styx  or the  Stygian  Gulph they could return no more and all their other Fables upon that Subject would have been overthrown and come to nothing if it had been otherwise such as  Cerberus  barking continually at the Gate  Charon  the Ferryman carrying all over but bringing none back and the like  BUT notwithstanding this as I have said they found several of these Souls visiting the World in Apparition and this quite destroy'd all the Scheme of their being in a determin'd State so that they knew not what to think of next  HOW would it have unravell'd all those hard Knots and made every thing easie to their Understanding had they been let into this just way of reasoning had they discover'd that there is an Angelick World an invisible World of Spirits some of whom being placed by their merciful Maker as an advanc'd Body at or near the out  r Circumference of the Earth's Atmosphere have a Power given them at least to take Cognizance of human Affairs and to converse with this World either by Apparition Voices Noises good or bad Omens or other sensible Conveyances to the Mind by which they can give Notices of Good or Evil and can intimate to Man many things useful to him in the Conduct of his Life  THAT the Spirits inhabiting this invisible World are at hand how near is not necessary to us to know can assume Bodies Shape Voice and even can personate this or that Man or Woman so as to appear in the very Figure Countenance and Cloaths or Dress of our departed Friends speak with their proper and distinct Voices and in the first Person of this or that particular Man or Woman and in their Names and can thus suit themselves in their several Appearances to the Occasion they appear for  HAD they known these things I say they would have rejoic'd in the Discovery and it would have made every thing easie to them  Patroclus  would never have troubled  Achilles  with a Visit from the Air upon pretence of his being left to be wandring about the Atmosphere for want of his Funeral Rites the Dogs or the Crows or the Worms might have feasted themselves on  Hector  's Carcass it would never have disturb'd  Hector  in the least much less would her Goddessship  Venus  have concern'd herself to protect his Corps 'till the funeral Pile was prepar'd  THE Doctrine of the Soul's being a Shell or Case form'd into a Shape as a Mould is form'd into Shape to receive the Brass or Copper and throw out a Statue or Figure of this or that Heroe which it is appointed to form I say this absurd Doctrine of the Soul Body and Mind being three distinct Persons in every Man would not have found Place in the World but all things would have been conceiv'd regularly of and the World would have been rightly inform'd of future things as well as of things present  HOWEVER to bring it down to our Case all this concurs to the Doctrine of Spirits and the Reality of their Appearance which is the Case before us Their Friends departed did appear what it was appear'd they knew not only negatively they knew it was not their Bodies however the Shape might be assumed nor could they reconcile that Part to their Understanding How it could be that the Body seem'd to appear and did not appear or as we might say appear'd as if they had appear'd but when a Tryal was offer'd no Body could be found as was the Case of  Patroclus  and  Achilles  in  Homer  which Mr  Pope  thus translates  He said and with his longing Arms essay'd  In vain to grasp the visionary Shade  Like a thin Smoke he sees the Spirit fly  And hears a feeble lamentable Cry  HOW gross an Ignorance is here in so great a Man as  Achilles  to go about to grasp a Vision to feel a Shade One can hardly excuse the Poet for allowing  Achilles  who was the Heroe of the whole Poem to be so weak even in those Days but it must be allowed 'twas all in a Dream and imaginary and it might well awake him indeed as it did to grasp at a Man in Armour and find nothing in his Arms but Smoke  THE Result of it all is this namely the Reality of Apparition was a certain undoubted and received thing 'tis evident that they were not questioned for upon the Reality of the Appearance of Souls all those Pains were taken to settle the Possibility of it That it was so the Frequency of the thing left them no Room to question it would have been ri  iculous to have disputed it but how it could b  how to reconcile it to all the Notions of Soul and Body the future and the present State that was what no body could explain and no body could understand which Ignorance put their Invention so much on the Rack to find out and form Schemes for the bringing the Particulars together and making the Appearance possible whichthey daily found was in Fact real  'TWAS a little strange that tho' they were satisfied by daily Demonstration that the Thing was true yet they were obliged to believe it was not true at the same time They frequently saw their Friends appear and yet knew they were not in a Condition from whence they could return to appear But the strangest thing of all at least to  me is that they should not all this while conceive the Possibility of Spirits assuming human Shape and appearing in their Figures in their Shapes and in their Names  THIS would have put an end to all the Difficulty and have reconciled all the Doubts that attended it and at the same time would have led them into several sublime Truths such as they were perhaps perfectly ignorant of as particularly into the great Doctrine of the Unity of infinite Power the universal Empire of Providence and its Government and Influence of and upon all the Affairs of this World even the most minute things in Life and many other valuable Inquiries  THAT Apparitions were believed to be real in those Days is evident from many Instances of it given in History tho' I have not room to look far back 'Tis said that  Alexander  the Great was haunted by the Ghost of his Friend  Clitus  whom he had most ungratefully tortur'd to Death after a long Series of the most faithful Services and successful also but there is no particular Account of it in  Plutarch  THE Apparition of the Ghost of  Julius Caesar  to  Brutus  a little before the Battel at  Philippi  tho' it be certain is nevertheless variously reported some Accounts relate it to be the Ghost of  Julius Caesar  and vulgar Opinion concurs with that Report which is so receiv'd at this time that they show you an original antient Piece of fine  Italian  Painting at  Naples  where the Phantome is represented bloody and wounded with  Casca  's Dagger sticking in his Shoulder which he  Casca  reaching his Arm over his Shoulder fix'd in or near his Collar Bone before and left sticking there according to which our Frontespiece to this Work is at least design'd Whether that Part of the Story be right represented or not is difficult to determine  BUT according to other Accounts the Apparition was only of a Man without any Similitude of  Caesar  and that when  Brutus  who was busy writing Dispatches for his Army which was then drawing together to fight the  Octavian  Troops look'd up and saw him he boldly ask'd  What art thou  and the Apparition answer'd  I am thy evil Genius and I will meet thee again at  Philippi to which the undaunted Hero unconcern'd at the Sight and as if he desir'd him not to disturb him at that time he being then otherwise engaged answer'd  Well I'll meet thee there  and so went on with his writing  BRUTUS  was without doubt a Hero in his personal Valour and more so in his Principle  viz  the Love of Liberty and of his Country and as nothing but the Zeal for the Liberty of his Country could have embark'd him against the Life of  Caesar  who was otherwise his Benefactor so he was above the Fear of Death and could not be in the least daunted at the Foreknowledge of his Fate at  Philippi  seeing he had the Notion of Life which was general at that time namely that a true Heroe could never be miserable since it was always in his Power to die a Freeman and not to outlive any threatned Calamity whether Personal or National  UPON this foot he enter'd that unequal Battel against the  Octavian  Troops with an undaunted Chearfulness for he was sure one way or other to come off victorious that is to say that if  Augustus  conquer'd his Army he knew how to conquer  Augustus  if by the Slaughter of his Troops  Caesar  had the better of him and defeated his Designs for the Liberty of his Country He by the Slaughter of himself knew how to defeat  Augustus  in his Designs of conquering  Brutus  since he resolv'd to die free and not survive the  Roman  Liberty and so he did  AND upon this Foundation it was that he was so unconcerned at his approaching Fate and so undaunted in his looking at and speaking to the Spectre that appear'd to him  BUT we have yet abundance more Proofs by Example of the Reality of Apparitions  ALARICH  the famous  Gothick  King who overrun so much of the  Roman  Empire had an Apparition which came to him and told him he should undertake his Expedition against the  Romans  and that promis'd him Victory and Success some said it was an Angel others that it was the Ghost of his deceased Predecessor  Rhadagaiseus  When he first undertook to raise his Army he was intending to go upon a glorious Expedition to the East  to wit  against the  Hunns  and the  Heruli  that is to say into  Poland Sclavonia  and  Hungaria  and perhaps  Mus  ovy  or  Russia  But upon the Apparition speaking to him he was encourag'd to undertake a War against the  mans  in  Italy  where notwithstanding he was routed and utterly overthrown by  Stilico  he afterwards return'd into  Italy  kill'd  Stilico  the  Roman  General overrun the Country and took and plunder'd the City of  Rome  it self this was  Ann  so that the Apparition of whatever kind it was must be so far  Angelic  as to foreknow Events and Issues of things on Earth which must be suitable to the Angelic Heavenly Spirits and superior to the Diabolic Spirits who know nothing Prophetic  NOR is it any thing inconsistent with the Angelic exalted and good Spirits for this was not encouraging Evil but stirring up a powerful Prince who was to be  Flagellum Dei  to execute the Divine Vengeance upon that wicked People the  Romans  whom God had resolved to destroy or at least to reduce very low  like as God is  said to stir up  Nebuchadnezzar  King of  Babylon  to come up against  Jerusalem  I SAY this could not be the  Devil  because as I have always insisted upon it so I do still that he knows nothing of what is to come the  Devil  is no Prophet he cannot foretell or predict oth  than by probable Guesses rational Consequences and such Circumstances in which he can go farther than other People  YOU have an Example of this in the famous Sorceress  Jaquelina  she pretended to speak in the Name of the  Devil  and sometimes to have the  Devil  speak in her and so to give Answers as by an Oracle and resolve Doubts and difficult Questions which she did to Admiration and thereby got both Fame and Money Now it was observ'd that when People came to her with Doubts and difficult Cases even such as none could resolve relating to things past or present her Answers were surprizing but if they came to her to ask any Opinion of things future and what should be to come the  Devil  was always Nonplust and generally lyed in his Answers so that none  ould depend upon any thing he said In a word the  Devil  was not able to foretell any thing and hence I infer as I havealways said the  Devil  is no Prophet he can predict nothing for he knows nothing and that if any Apparition comes to be seen or heard who takes upon it to tell what should come to pass you may depend upon it that Apparition is not from the  Devil  HENCE I think we may readily account for that Story so well publish'd whether so well known or no of which Mr  Aubrey  has given us the last Relation as follows  TWO Persons Ladies of Quality both not being long since deceased were intimate Acquaintance and lov'd each other intirely It so fell out that one of them fell sick of the SmallPox and  desired mightily to see the other who would not come fearing the catching of them the Afflicted at last dies of them she had not been buried very long but she appears at the other's House in the dress of a Widow and asks for her Friend who was then at Cards but sends down her Woman to know her Business who in short told her she must impart it to none but her Lady who after she had received this Answer bid her Woman have her into a Room and desire her to stay till the Game was done and she would wait on her The Game being done down Stairs she came to the Apparition to know her Business  Madam  says the Ghost turning up her Veil and her Face appearing full of the SmallPox  You know very well that you and I lov'd intirely and your not coming to see me I took so ill at your Hands that I could not rest 'till I had seen you  and now I am come  to tell you that you have not long to live therefore prepare to die and when you are at a Feast and make the thirteenth in Number then remember my Words  and so the Apparition vanish'd To conclude she was at a Feast where she made the thirteenth Person in Number and was afterwards asked by the deceased's Brother whether his Sister did appear to her as was reported she made him no Answer but fell a weeping and died in a little time after The Gentleman that told this Story says that there is hardly any Person of Quality but what knows it to be true  I DO not enter into an Enquiry here whether the Story is true or no I believe it in Common for it was generally believ'd to be true But 'tis strange to have this brought for an Evidence of the Prescience of the  Devil  whereas on the contrary it confirms what I have said  viz  That this cou'd not be the  Devil  or what we call the Appearance of the  Devil  no nor could it be the Soul of the departed Person and for the Apparition saying it could not be at Rest either it may be put in by some of the very many Authors relating the Story or it might be said by the good Angel or Spirit appearing to introduce her Message and to rouze the Mind of the Person spoken to by something that should touch her more to the quick be the more feeling and sensible to her and so make a due Impression upon her of the Truth of that which was to follow  BUT first for its not being the  Devil  for I have granted that the  Devil  may make an Apparition tho' far from inferring from thence that all Apparitions are the  Devil  But I say as to its not being the  Devil  that appear'd here in the Shape of the deceas'd Lady 'tis Evident  FIRST  Because as I said above and have repeated often the  Devil  cannot predict he has no Prescience of things before they are in View he can juggle and play scurvy Tricks of many kinds as when he prophesied to the Farmer the Fall of his Stack of Corn and then rais'd a sudden Storm and blew it down It may be he can see at some farther Distance than we can and judge of the Consequences of such and such Causes better than we can and with a more perfect and exact Judgment But to predict things which are only conceal'd in the Womb of Time and behind the Curtain of Providence as this of Life and Death was it is not in  Satan  to do it and therefore this could not be from the  Devil  the Lady was in Health was Chearful nay Merry was at a Feast and at Cards Here was no Signal of Death or so much as of Sickness I see no token of the  Devil  in this Apparition except it be his extraordinary Civility that he would not interrupt her Game  SECONDLY  It could not be the  Devil  because of his bidding the Lady prepare for Death  which as I have often observ'd does not seem to be much of Satan's Business not being very suitable to his Disposition and less to his Design  THERE is some little Incongruity in this Story too which renders it inconsistent not with the  Devil  only but even with the Nature of a Spirit or Apparition As Why should the Apparition come when the Lady was engag'd and could not speak to her as if she being a Ghost or Spirit as we vulgarly express it did not know what she was doing as well as where she was How does her taking ill the living Lady's not visiting her oblige her to come and give her this kind Notice of her Death  I took it so ill at your Hands that I could not rest 'till I had seen you  THO' this does not shock my Belief of the Apparition it self yet it seems to hint that the several Hands thro' which the Relation has pass'd have made up the Speech for the Ghost and committed some Blunders in it that are inde  d shocking to the Reader  IT seems more rational to be as I have read the Story that the Ghost should say thus  Tho' I took it very ill at your Hands that you wou'd not come to see me  yet I could not rest 'till  I had seen you to tell you that you have not long to live and that you should prepare  c This is much better Sense and more agreeable to the Nature of the thing for certainly coming in that manner to give the Lady No  ice of the Approach of her End and to counsel her to  prepare accordingly  must be allow'd to be an act of Kindness not of Resentment and a T  stimony of the Affection that was between them and therefore her taking it ill that she had not been to Visit her in her Illness could not rationally be given as a Reason for it  BUT as to the Apparition it self since it could not be the Soul of the deceas'd Lady and for the  Reasons above was not likely to be the  Devil  or I may venture to say positively was not the  Devil  What then was it I answer with a Question What could it be but a good Angel or Angelic Spirit from the Invisible World sent with a Message of Goodness and a merciful Notice of her Approaching Death that she might receive a due caution preparing her Mind and turning her Thoughts to a proper Meditation upon so serious a Subject in a word warning her of Death that she might prepare for it  THE Story of Sir  John Burroughs  's Son who forsaking a Mistress in  Italy  she murther'd her self and then haunted him as long as he liv'd this is of like kind with the rest and tho' the  Devil  to worry and perplex him might take up the Appearance of his Whore as well reproaching him with the Crime as with her Tragical End yet it goes no farther than this that the  Devil  may appear and may harrass and terrify those he appear'd to and this I make no doubt of and it rather adds to what is insisted on I mean the Reality of Apparitions but the  Devil  gave this Gentleman no good advice to repent or prepare and the like but only appear'd frighted and terrify'd him to the very Day of his Death  IT is also remarkable that tho' this  Devil  in Apparition shewed it self to him the very Day of his Death for he was kil  'd that Day in a Duel yet it said not a word to him of what was to befall him or of what he was going to do and 'tis very probable did not know it  THERE is another Story something but darkly recorded of  Charles  VII of  France  which seems likely enough to be an Apparition of the  Devil  That King had been distemper'd and very ill two or three times but was recover'd again tolerably well and was riding for the Benefit of the Air in the  Forest of  Mans  On a sudden a Spectre starts up or out of the Woods being a tall meagre illlook'd old Man of ghastly Countenance and half naked and coming directly to the King takes hold of his Horse's Bridle and says  Stop King Whether go you you are betray'd  and then immediateiy vanished Now first of all this was a falshood in Fact for the King was not betray'd by any body neither was there any Plot against him or against any that belong'd to him ever heard of before or afterwards on the contrary  Secondly  his Reign was at that time peaceable and quiet his Subjects all easy and for his Person he had so few Enemies that he was call'd  Charles the Beloved  and was exceedingly tendred by the generality of his People  A GOOD Spirit an Angelic Spirit one of the Sacred Guard I have suppos'd to be placed about this Earth or in the Regions adjacent and employed by their Bountiful Maker for the good of Mankind would never have come in such a manner surprising and at unawares It would never have put on a fierce and frightful Countenance thus to have terrified a poor distemper'd Prince whose Brain was already disorder'd taking the advantage of his Weakness and so to encrease the Frenzy and Distraction of his Mind even to his Destruction for he never more perfectly recover'd his Senses  THIS mightily differ'd from the Conduct of the several Spirits appearing in the Examples mention'd before and who kindly warn'd the Persons of Danger foretold Events that they might avoid them or prepare for the Consequences in a word this was an Apparition purely  Devilish  for it was meerly to do Evil and to the ruin of the Person to whom it appear'd  I THINK nothing can be a juster Rule for us to distinguish Apparitions by the Evil Spirit  Devil  like comes to deceive he is the Father of Lyes and comes to do hurt he is a Lover and the Author of Mischief The good Spirit is from God the Fountain of all Good and appears always for good and merciful Purposes and this I think is a just Observation and a Rule for us to judge of the Nature of whatever Apparitions we hear of  CHAP X Of the different Nature of Apparitions how we should behave to them when to be afraid of or concern'd about them and when not  DANGER may be the Reason of Caution but Guilt only is the reason of Fear Caution is the Mind's just Regard to the Evil in view but Fear is a Horror of the Soul in apprehension of some farther Evil yet out of view unseen and therefore terrible merited and therefore dreadful  IF there were no Guilt in the Mind Death it self would be no Evil and therefore not the Subject of our Fear nor is Death it self our Fear now as it is in it self a meer passing out of life otherwise than as it is an inlet of some terrible State beyond it  It is not what we pass out of that is the bitterness but what we pass into not what we part with but what the Exchange will be not the leap out of Light but the leap into the Dark and to come nearer to it the Thought of what is beyond Death is only made better or worse by what we know on this side of it the Dread of what is to come is founded on our conscious sense of what is past  THIS State beyond Death is made our Terror as we expect in it the Punishment of Offences a  Retrbitution for an illspent Life and as we have upon our Minds a Sense of Guilt that is to say a Conscience of having illspent our past time and dreading the Justice of the Superior Hand in whom is the Power of Rewards and Punishments Now to bring it to the case in Hand  ALL Apparition is look'd upon as  a something  coming or sent to us from that State of  Being  which is beyond Death and therefore is look'd upon with the same Terror and Fright which we are seiz'd with at the Thoughts of Death it self  HENCE if we could consider calmly the Nature of the Apparition which we s  e we might presently know whether we ha  reason to be terrified at the Apparition  yea  or  no  If the Apparition comes with a Message of Peace if it reprehends with Kindness and Tenderness if it admonishes with Gentleness and gives Advice to amend and reform it certainly comes from a good Hand and we need be under no concern at all about it because it has no Evil in it self  IF it come in all its threatning Postures ghastly as the  Devil  can make it horrible as himself in Person yet were there no Guilt there would be no fear from the Apparition or even from the  Devil  appearing in Person because we should know our+selves to be out of his Power  AS then the Good or Evil of the Message which the Apparition brings distinguishes the Apparition it self and tells us of what kind it is so as our Minds are or are not intimidated by our own Guilt so we have or have not reason to be surpriz'd at the Appearance of a Messenger or Messengers from the invisible World or at whatever he  hall say  Hic murus aheneus esto  Nil conscire sibi nulla palescere culpa  MR  Aubery  gives us the Story in his  Miscellanea  of the Apparition to  Cashio Burroughs  Esq in the time of King  Charles  I and which I hinted at just now on another occasion the Story is as follows  SIR  John Burroughs  being sent Envoy to the Emperor by King  Charle  I did take his Eldest Son  Cashio Burroughs  along with him and taking his Journey through  Italy  le  t his said Son at  Florence  to learn the Language where he having an Intrigue with a beautiful Courtisan Mistress to the Grand Duke their Familiarity became so publick that it came to the Duke's Ear who took a Resolution to have him murder'd but  Cashio  having had timely notice of the Duke's Design by some of the  English  ther  immediately left the City without acquainting his Mistress of it and came to  England  Whereupon the Duke being disappointed of his Revenge fell upon his Mistress in most reproachful Language She on the other side resenting the sudden departure of her Gallant of whom she was most passionately enamour'd killed her self At the same Moment that she expired she did appear to  Cashio  at his Lodgings in  London  Colonel  Remes  was then in Bed with him who saw her as well as he giving him an account of her Resentments of his Ingratitude to her in leaving her so suddenly and exposing her to the Fury of the Duke not omitting her own Tragical  Exit  adding withall that he should be slain in a Duel which accordingly happen'd And thus she appear'd to him frequently even when his younger Brother who afterwards was Sir  John  was in Bed with him As often as she did appear he would cry out with great Shricking and Trembling of his Body as well as Anguish of Mind saying  O GOD h  re she comes she comes  and at this rate she appear'd 'till he was  kill'd She appeared to him the Morning before he was killed Some of my Acquaintance says  Aubery  have told me that he was one of the handsomest Men in  England  and very Valiant  THE Appearance of this  Devil  for I can call it no other had nothing in View but to harrass plague and affright the Gentleman Perhaps expecting it should bring him into some fit of Desperation so to destroy himself as the Woman who appear'd had done before  THE Gentleman whom it appear'd to was conscious of Crime the Woman in whose shape the  Devil  thus harrass'd him was a  Courtesan  that is in  English  a Common Woman with whom he had had an Intrigue in  Italy  He had not only been dishonest with her but it seems had been dishonest to her and the last with the assistance of the  Devil  had it seems work'd so upon her Rage as to cause her to be her own Executioner and I take the Apparition to be the  Devil  pursuing the same Management and endeavouring to produce the same Effect upon him  NOW see the Consequence of Crime the sense of Guilt makes this Apparition dreadful to him when it appear'd he trembles falls into Convulsions cries out  O GOD here she comes  and in a word is in an Agony of horror and affright  HAD he only convers'd with the Lady as a common Acquaintance had he neither been concern'd with her or had done any dishonourable thing by her he had natural Courage to have look'd the  Devil  in the Face and boldly have ask'd  what business she could have with him  I HAVE read of a Story of a very religious Lady who the  Devil  it seems had some particular Picque at and set all his Stratagems at work to ruin her both Soul and Body He attack'd her in a hundred several ways in Covert as I may call it  that is to say by Attempts to draw her into Crime alluring her and laying Snares for her of several kinds But when he found himself steadily resisted by the Lady's resolv'd Virtue Modesty and Temperance he attack'd her in Person with frightful Apparitions assuming ugly and terrible Shapes and once appearing all in Fire with a frightful threatning Voice he told her he was come to fetch her away The Lady had a secret Spirit of Courage and Resolution came upon her at the very Moment and as we say in other cases brisking up to him as if she would fight him Resist the  Devil says she  and he shall flee from us come for me  added she  I'll venture that for I am sure thou liest  Satan  thou hast nothing to do with me  THE  Devil  call'd her Whore and told her she lov'd such a Man who was a marry'd Man and therefore she had intentionally committed Whoredom with him and should be damn'd  N B  It seems the Lady had lov'd that Gentleman before he was otherwise engag'd by marrying but had never had any Thought towards him or the least Acquaintance with him afterwards  THOU showest thyself  says she  to be full of Subtilty a real  Devil  and even Malice itself it is true I did love that Gentleman  says she  and thou settedst him to work to persuade me that he lov'd me and to court me with honourable Pretensions and so far gain'd upon me that I really loved him but  HERE he interrupted her and told her Such a time says the  Devil  you wish'd you were abed with him and you are as guilty by wishing to Sin as if you had done it  THOU art the Father of Lies  Satan says she  and the Father of Lyars and thou liest in this nay thou liest like a  Devil  that is maliciously for thou knowest that it is not true  YOU will be damn'd says he and I will take you away this minute  THOU canst not take me away without God's Permission  says she  and he will not give me into thy Hands therefore touch me at this Peril and with that she fell down on her Knees and cry'd LORD  preserve me from the evil Spirit  with which the  Devil  left her and walk'd off  THESE are Apparitions that may be call'd Apparitions of  Devils  indeed and by his Works you may know him for this is acting like himself but where there is no Guilt we need not be afraid of the  Devil  in whatever Shape or frightful Figure he thinks to attack us in  THIS Lady had never been able to reproach  Satan  with Lying if what he said had been true but she knew herself innocent and that put Courage into her Soul that she indeed Bully'd the  Devil  defy'd him and bad him do his worst  IT seems the  Devil  rumag'd hard to find a Crime out to charge this Lady with and came up to her very close but he was put to his shifts for Evidence for even in collecting all the Actions of her Life he could not find any thing of real Guilt to load her with  HE attack'd her after this in several Shapes and one time he told her she wou'd be damn'd for a Hypocrite for says he for all your pretended Sanctity you was in a violent Passion at such a time and you curst your Cousinnaming her Name to her  SHE answer'd as before boldly And Satan  says she  tho' you are a Devil and cannot be asham'd yet you are too cunning and too knowing to act like a Fool I was angry but in no Passion and for my Anger I had just cause but thou wast the cause of the Crime and so of the Anger too For she own'd the  Devil  tempted my Kinswoman to rob  me so thou hast been the Occasion both of her Sin and of my Anger  BUT you curs'd her and wish'd the  Devil  meaning me says he might take her  THAT'S like thee again  Devil says the Lady  I was far from wishing thou shouldst take her I am not so much thy Friend to wish thou shouldst be gratified in any one's Ruin But I told her indeed if she did such things thou wouldst take her away  BUT you ly'd in that  says he  for I won't hurt her  I AM sorry  says she  thou art so much her Friend  SHE is mine already  adds the Devil  I shall not do her any harm  VERY well  Devil says she  then I hope I am out of your List or why else are you raging at me  YES yes  says he  you shall be mine quickly as well as she  I DEFY thee  says she again  and I'll tell the poor Girl what you say of her I hope she will get out of your Hands again  THEN I'll break her Neck that Minute  says he  THAT'S not in your Power  says the Lady  WELL but  says he  you play'd at Cards on  Sunday  Morning last  SHE was a little surpriz'd at the Charge and stop'd awhile but recovering her Courage 'Tis strange  Devil  says she thou canst bring nothing but Lyes against me why I have Faults enough that are real Faults and true and that I could not deny Why I think  Satan  's turn'd Fool adds she as if she jeer'd him Why don't you fall upon me in those Things I am guilty of and not make Lyes  for the sake of lying I did play at Cards a  Saturday  Night but not a  Sunday  Morning  BUT said he you play'd at Cards against your Conscience too when you believ'd it was a Sin to play and you will be damn'd for that  WHY truly  Devil says she  you go nearest the Truth in this of any thing you have said for after our Minister's talking against Play one Evening he so far persuaded me that it was not lawful that I did resolve to leave it off  BUT you broke your Word and play'd again and did it I tell you against your Conscience  I DID not tie myself by any Promise but I did question a little indeed whether I should play any more or no  YES and did it against your Conscience I tell you and you shall be damn'd for that  HERE the Lady could not refrain Tears but still she answer'd the  Devil  boldly As thou art a Lyar Satan I hope I shall not because thou sayest I shall However thou shalt never have it to upbraid me with again for tho' I did not promise to Man I now promise it to the  Devil  I will never play more  IT'S too late now  says he  and threatned her again  NO  Satan says she  never too late for any one to Repent  but Thee  and thou shalt never Repent or be Forgiven  WITH this says my Story the  Devil  left her I have taken this by Abridgement from a very large Account of the several Disputes this courageous Lady had with the  Devil  for some Years which if I could assert the Particulars so as to be sure of the Truth of every Part and of my own Knowledge too I should make farther use of here but thus far they are to the present Occasion namely  THAT where the  Devil  appears he always does it like a  Devil  for some wicked Purpose or other  WHERE he cannot prevail and excite to do Mischief he assaults with Rage and threatens with suffering Mischief  THE good Spirits or good Angels are quite of another Kind and as they come or are sent from other Hands so they come of other Errands and in another manner as I shall give a more particular Account of presently  BUT let us from hence enquire into an Opinion which I have met with and that of some Men of Learning and Judgment  viz  That take the Apparitions in general whether of good or bad Spirits they never or very rarely do any harm As for the good Spirits we know as above they will do none and if the bad do not 'tis because they can't  THE good Spirits 'tis certain will do no harm it is by their general appearing for good that we determine them to be good Spirits and that kind of Judgment is certainly very just but if the evil Spirits which do appear do no harm neither it is because they are under some extraordinary restraint of Divine Power so that tho' they may come about in the Air they are not suffer'd to do any considerable Mischief in the World In both which cases all the Occasion of our Terror about them is taken away for whether they are good Spirits or evil Spirits restrain'd 'tis much the same one will do you no hurt and the other cannot and there remains no room then for the Pannick which is so much upon us when we hear of them  IT is true that Angels have sometimes been sent in Judgment from Heaven and have executed God's terrible Threatnings upon Men in an  apparent Shape as the Angel call'd the Destroying Angel which  David  saw in the Air with his Sword drawn and stretch'd over  Jerusalem  to destroy it  Chron  xxi So the Angel of the Lord that slew of the  Assyrians  in one Night and it is not improbable that an Host of Angels or Apparitions appear'd in the  Assyrian  Camp and cut in Pieces the  Assyrian  Army with a Terror that they were not able to resist  THESE are extraordinary and miraculous Cases so likewise is that when the Angel appeared to  Balaam  with a flaming Sword and told him that if the Ass had not turn'd away from him he the  Angel  had slain him  Numb  xxii But we are not now speaking of Angels sent out with especial Commissions to execute God's Vengeance but of the Apparition of good Spirits or Angels from the invisible World of Spirits who frequently appear and sometimes upon small and very trifling Occasions and who visit People as well by Night as by Day this we call Walking and Apparition and this is such as is the Subject of our present Enquiry  OF these it is that I say however they may disturb us and however terrified we are about them they very rarely do any harm  I HAVE heard of an Apparition which came to a Farmer in  Surry  and threatned him that he would burn his House and his Barn and all his Corn and Hay what his Pretences were the Story does not relate or what the poor Farmer had done to disoblige him but the Man was it seems in the utmost Consternation and expostulated with the Apparition a great while but at last he pluck'd up his Spirits and spoke with a little more Courage to it  WHAT art thou says he that threatnest me thus without a cause and sayest thou wilt ruin me  notwithstanding I never did thee any wrong thou shouldst be the  Devil  by thy usage of me for good Spirits never do any Injustice  TO this the  Devil  answer'd in a long and to appearance a threatning Speech but in a Language the poor Man did not understand one Word of  I KNOW not what thou sayest  says the Farmer  but I tell thee again thou seem'st to me to be the  Devil  or one of his Angels and I suppose those are Words understood in the bottomless Pit but  hreaten me no more with thy Rage and with burning my House and Corn thou art a great Dragon indeed but thou art chain'd and canst do nothing but what thou art permitted to do by thy Maker and I fear thee not Upon which the poor Man pray'd Mentally that he might be deliver'd from the Power of the  Devil  and away run the Spectre and did him no harm  THIS was certainly a commendable Courage and had something of the Christian in it too and such a Courage and upon the like Foundation would for ought I know lay all the  Devils  that ever walk'd and drive away all the Apparitions and Spirits that People are so terribly haunted with and so terrify'd about  CHAP XI Of Apparitions in Dream and how far they are or are not real Apparitions  THERE may be Dreams without Apparition as there may be Apparitions without Dreams but Apparition in Dream may be as really an Apparition as if the Person who saw it was awake The difference may be here that the Apparition  in a Dream is visible to the Soul only for the Soul never sleeps and an Apparition to the Eyesight is visible in common Perspective  HOW is it then that we see in our Dreams the very Faces and Dress of the Person we dream of nay hear their Voices and receive due Impressions from what they say and oftentimes speak to them with our own Voices articulately and audibly tho' we are fast asleep What secret Power of the Imagination is able to represent the Image of any Person to itself if there was not some Appearance something plac'd in the Soul's view by a secret but invisible Hand and in an imperceptible manner which Something is in all Respects and to all Purposes as compleatly an Apparition as if it was plac'd in open sight when the Person was awake  THE Scripture confirms this Opinion by many Expressions directly to the purpose and particularly this of Appearing or Apparition in Dream  Gen  xx  God came to  Abimelech  in a Dream  had it been said that  Abimelech dream'd  that God came to him there might have been some exception to the Parallel but God actually  came to him  and what tho'  Abimelech  was asleep and in a Dream it was not the less an Apparition for  God came to him  and spoke  and said to him  and in the th Verse  Abimelech  spoke to the Apparition Whatever the Shape was that the Text does not mention but  Abimelech  knew who he talk'd with too that's evident for the Text mentions it fully  And he said  LORD  wilt thou slay also a righteous Nation  and so he goes on Verse the fifth to expostulate and plead for himself and his People  said he not unto me she is my Sister  so that he knew he was speaking to  the Lord  The Text is very remarkable it is plain that there was an Apparition but the Man was asleep and in a Dream  AGAIN in the case of  Laban  pursuing  Jacob Gen  xxxi  God came to  Laban  the  Syrian  in a Dream by Night and said unto him  Here again is an Apparition and a speaking Apparition too GOD came to him and GOD spoke to him and  Laban  owns not that he dream'd of God's appearing but that God really spoke to him  v    The God of your Father spake to me Yesternight saying  CERTAINLY Dreams in those Days were another kind of thing than they are now God spoke to them and they answer'd and when they were awake they knew that it was God that spoke and gave heed to the Vision or Apparition of God to them  THERE are many more Instances of the like in the sacred History as first in the remarkable case of King  Solomon    Kings  iii  The Lord appeared to  Solomon  in a Dream by Night and  GOD  said ask what I shall give th  e  THIS is call'd in the Scripture a Dream  v    and  Solomon  awoke and behold it was a Dream  and yet it is all confirmed and the Petition that  Solomon  made tho' in his Sleep or Dream is accepted and answer'd as his real Act and Deed as if he had been awake A good hint  by the way  that we may both please and offend in our Dreams as really as if we were awake but that is a hint I say by itself  THAT Passage of  Solomon  is very remarkable to the case in hand If my Readers please to believe that there was such a Man as  Solomon  and that he had such a Dream they must allow also that it was a real Apparition God appeared to him in a Dream  TO bring it down a step lower as God has thus Personally appeared to Men in Dreams so have inferior Spirits and we have Examples of this too in the Scripture  Matt  i  While he thought on  these Things behold the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a  DREAM and again  Matt  ii  Behold the Angel of the Lord appeared unto  Joseph  in a Dream saying  and a third time 'tis repeated the Angel came again to him in  Aegypt v  of the same Chapter when  Herod  was dead  Behold an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a Dream to  Joseph  in  Aegypt  I WILL for once suppose that no Man need desire any farther Evidence than these for the Reality of the thing it self we may bring it down from hence by just Parallels to Matters within our own Reach Experience will furnish us with particular Passages sufficient and some Account I shall give you within the Compass of our own Times in which if I do as much as possible as I have done all along omit all those Accounts which others have publish'd refering you to those Publications for the particulars and only give you new and more modern Accounts such as come within the Verge of my own Knowledge or of the Knowledge of such as I have good Reason to give Credit to I believe the Variety will be as acceptable and much more useful than a bare Repeating of what others have said If I find it needful to quote what others have publish'd you shall have it justly mark'd as a Quotation that you may search for the Truth in its Original  BUT before I come to Quotation or to Collection of Story 'tis needful to observe here also that as it has pleas'd God to appear in this Manner and to cause Angels to appear also in the same Manner and upon special Occasions so I make no Question but the  Devil  often appears in Dreams too and I might give but too many Examples of it as particularly one in the Scripture  IT is apparent that God gave  Satan  a kind of general License to a  flict  Job  only not to kill him with such a terrible Commission it might be expected  the  Devil  would fall upon him with the utmost Fury he was capable of or at least that he was allow'd to take he ruin'd his Fortunes reduc'd him to Misery murther'd his Children tormented him with Boils and Sores in short left him nothing but Potsherds and an ill Wife to relieve him and as he had worry'd him to use a modern Phrase  within an Inch of his Life  he follow'd him in the Night with Apparition lest he should recruit Nature with Rest and be a little refresh'd with Sleep  Job  himself complains of it  Job  vii  Thou scarest me with  DREAMS  and terrifiest me  with VISIONS Not that GOD appear'd to  Job  in any frightful or terrible Form but the  Devil  to whom God was pleas'd to give a Liberty of afflicting  Job  took that Liberty and exerted his Malice to the utmost in such  Manner We are not indeed told what M  hods the  Devil  took to scare and terrifie that poor distress'd Sufferer but as he can show us nothing uglier and more frightful than himself so it is very likely he appear'd to him in Person and that in the most surprizing Manner possible with all the Circumstances of Horror that he was able  'TIS thought by some who critically note tha  Part of the Text where  Pilate  's Wife warn'd her Husband to have nothing to do in condemning Christ to be crucified that it was the  Devil  that stirr'd her up to oppose it  Satan  as soon as he perceiv'd that the Death of Christ however intended for Mischief by the  Jews  and pursued violently by them in their Rage and Malice at our Lord personally was yet a thing appointed by the determinate Council of God for the Salvation of Mankind I say as soon as he perceiv'd that Part which 'tis probable he did not know before he strove all he could to prevent it and as fierce as he had been to irritate the  Jews  before and raise their  Fury and Malice up to a Pitch even to almost rabballing the Governor into it now he underhand strove to prevent it and us'd this Stratagem among others by attacking  Pilate  's Wife in the Night and setting her to persuade her Husband that he was going to deliver up an innocent Person to gratifie the  Jews  and that he should have a care what he did Matt xxvii  When he was set down on the Judgmentseat his Wife sent unto him saying Have thou nothing to do with that just Man For I have suffer'd many things this Day in a Dream because of him  WHETHER it was so or not 'tis very probable the many things she suffer'd must be from the  Devil  because Heaven by whose determinate Council and Foreknowledge the Death of Christ was appointed would have done nothing to have prevented or interrupted his own Appointment  NOW as the Dreams in those Days and our Dreams at this Time are exceeding different and that as our Heads are so full of impertinent Thoughts in the Day which in proportion crowd the Imagination at Night so our Dreams are trifling and foolish How shall we do to know when they are to be taken Notice of and when not When there is a real Apparition haunting us or showing it self to us and when not in a word when an Angel or when a  Devil  appears to us in a Dream  IT is a nice Question and as it does not particularly relate to the present Enquiry so it would require too long a Digression to discourse Critically upon it but I shall dismiss it with this short Answer We must judge as I said before in the Case of open Apparitions by the Weight and by the Nature of the Message or Errand which the Apparion comes about evil Messengers seldom come of good Errands and Angels good or bad seldom come on trifling Messages  TRIFLING Dreams are the Product of the Mind being engag'd in trifling Matters a Child dreams of its Play a Housewife dreams of her Kitchen a Nurse of the Children a Tradesman of his Shop these have nothing of Apparition in them nothing of Angels or Spirts God or  Devil  but when Dream comes up to Vision and the Soul is embark'd in a superior Degree to a Commerce above the ordinary Rate then you may conclude you have had some extraordinary Visitors that you have been in some good or bad Company in the Night and you are left to judge of what kind by the Substance or Tenour of the Vision If it be to open the Understanding to encrease Knowledge to seal Instruction in a word if it is for direction to good Actions or stirring up the Soul of Man to perform his Duty to God or Man 'tis certainly from above 'tis an Apparition from God 'tis a Vision of Angels and good Spirits Job xxxiii  In a Dream in a Vision of the Night when deep Sleep falleth upon Men in slumbrings upon the Bed  IF it be an Allurement to Vice laying before you an Opportunity to steal presenting an Object of Beauty an Intic  ment to commit an unlawful Action depend upon it 'tis from the dark Regions 'tis an Apparition of the  Devil  and he employs his Agents and perhaps attends in Person to draw you into Mischief  N B  HERE 'tis worth a wise Man's considering whether the  Devil  representing a Temptation to any Person in a Dream and the Person complying he is not guilty of the Fact as really as if he had been awake I leave it only as a Head of Reflection For Example  THE  Devil  subtle in his Contrivance as well as vigilant in Application of Circumstances knows a Man to be in perplex'd Circumstances distress'd for  want of Money a perishing Family a craving Necessity he comes in his Sleep and presents him with a little Child dress'd up with Jewels of a great Value and a Purse of Gold in its Hand and all this as happening in a Place perfectly opportune for the Purpose the Nurse having negligently left the Child out of her Sight  AS he presents the Temptation he stands at the Person's Elbow prompts him says Take away that Chain or String of Pearl and the Purse the Child is alone it can tell no Tales take it quickly are not you in Distress and do you not want it at this time to an Extremity and can any one ever discover it the Child's Friends are rich it will do them no hurt if they valu'd such things they would never have put them about a little Child it is no great Matter to them besides 'tis due to their Vanity and Ostentation which was the only reason of dressing up a little Child in such a Manner Come come take it up quickly it may save you from Ruin and as soon as you are able you may make them Satisfaction again and so discharge your Conscience The Man unable to resist the Snare consents strips the innocent Child of its Ornaments and goes away unseen but in a Moment or two wakes with the Surprise sees it is a Cheat and looks back on it with a double Regret That he is disappointed of the Prize which he wanted and fancy'd himself reliev'd by That the  Devil  Triumphs over him and he is both deluded into the Crime and deceived in the Expectation of its Reward  I COULD give this in the Form of a Relation of Fact and give Evidence of the Truth of it for I had the Account of it from the Person's own Lips who was attack'd in Sleep and as he said with a sincere Affliction yielded to the Temptation and I committed the barbarous Robbery  said he  with the utmost Resentment I plunder'd and strip'd the poor smiling Infant who innocently play'd with me when I took off its Ornaments gave me the Purse of Gold out of its little Pocket and bid me keep it for her to play with I robb'd it  says he  in my Imagination and deserve as much to be hang'd for it as if I had actually committed the horrid Fact at Noonday Ay  says he  with a kind of Tremor in his Conscience from the Horror of the Fact I ought to be hang'd for it and to be damn'd for it too for I as really and effectually did it as if I had been apprehended and carry'd to  Newgate  for it  IT is true it gave him a particular Satisfaction with respect to his Personal Safety that he had not committed the Fact but it gave him no less Trouble in his Conscience than if he had been actually guilty  WHAT was this but an Apparition of the  Devil  a real visible Apparition visible to the Mind tho' not to the Body and that in a double Capacity too the  Devil without  in the Temptation and the  Devil within  yielding to it  I KNOW another living Example of this kind and I had that Part too from the Person himself He was a sober religious Gentleman he was in the letter of it a single Man for tho' he had been unhappily married he liv'd in a separate State from his Wife and to say no more of it upon a justifiable Occasion namely that his Wife was wickedly gone away as he suppos'd with another Man  BEFORE he was marry'd to the unhappy Woman he had lov'd a very handsom beautiful Lady and had gone so far as to court her a long time for Marriage but some Difficulty in their Circumstances prevented their coming together and he took another which the first Lady resented so as that it cost her too dear for she died soon after  THE Affliction of this was very heavy to him  after he found himself abus'd in his real Marriage as above I say after for at first it seems it was not Under the melancholy Reflections of these contrary Circumstances which frequently loaded his Mind He dreams one Night that his former Mistress came to him with a smiling Countenance I might have express'd it rather that his former Mistress  appear'd to him in a Dream  and with a smiling chearful Countenance told him that his Runaway Wife was Dead and now you are mine says the Apparition He receiv'd the News with a particular Satisfaction and embrac'd the Lady as his former Inclinations dictated to him he had not the least Notion as he protested solemnly or the least Remembrance that she was dead  WHEN he awak'd and found it all a Dream he was exceedingly afflicted with the Surprise looking upon himself to be as really Guilty as if he had been awake and the Lady alive and I cannot but say he had some Reason  WHETHER this if really True could be any thing but an Apparition of an evil Spirit the  Devil  laying a Snare for him and prevailing with him in Dream in a manner and to commit a Crime which he could not prevail with him to be guilty of when she was alive  I COULD give an Account of another Person whom the  Devil  haunted frequently and that for many Years together with lewd Apparitions tempting him in his Sleep with the Company of beautiful Women sometimes naked sometimes even in Bed with him and at other times in Conversation prompting him to Wickedness and that sometimes he was prevail'd upon to consent but always happily prevented by waking in time But the Case has on two or three Occasions been mention'd by other Hands and the Person is too much known to allow the farther Description of it without his Consent  I CANNOT doubt but these things are stated formal Apparitions of the  Devil  and tho' the Perso nmay be asleep and not thoroughly sensible either of what he is doing or of what is doing with him yet that the evil Spirit is actually present with him in Apparition I think will not admit of any Question  THE World is too full of Examples of this kind to enter into a long Account of the Particulars There is hardly a Book upon the Subject but is filled up with historical Relations hardly a Person to be convers'd with upon the Subject but is full of them either for themselves or some of their Acquaintance and every one is rendering their Dreams to be considerable and all to come to pass But out of five hundred Dreams so told and which so much Stress is seemingly laid on 'tis hard to find one that we can call a real Apparition in Dream  THE great and perhaps one of the greatest Difficulties of Life I mean that relates to Dreams is to distinguish between such as are real Apparitions and such as are only the Product of an incumber'd Brain a distemper'd Head or which is worse a distemper'd Mind But some Dreams are so significant and there follows such an immediate visible Effect answering the design'd Illumination that it cannot but be significant  A CERTAIN Gentleman who had lately buried his Wife a Lady of great Piety and Virtue was so exceedingly afflicted at his Loss that among other melancholy things which were the Effect of it this was one that he was so far from desiring to marry again that he entertained a settled riveted Aversion to the whole Sex and was never thoroughly easie in their Company and thus he liv'd near two Years  AFTER a certain time his Wife appear'd to him in his Dream or he dream'd that he saw his Wife but I rather put it in the first Sense She came to him as he thought to the Bedside with a smiling and pleasant Countenance and calling him by the Term which she always gave him  My Dearest  HE was in a great Consternation but could not speak to her but she said Do not be afraid of me I will do you no Hurt and then said What is the Reason that you mourn thus for me  He still said nothing that is to say he dream'd that he said nothing but that he fetch'd a deep Sigh  COME come  says she  Friends lost are Friends lost and cannot be recalled  THEN he spoke  that is dream'd that he spoke  and ask'd her why she appear'd to him  SHE said  to put an End to his unreasonable Grief  HOW can that be  says he  You now encrease my Grief by bringing your self thus to my Remembrance  NO no  says she  you must forget me and pray take another Wife which will be the way to cause you to forget me effectually  NO no  said he  that I can never do and how can you desire it of me  YES  says she  I do desire it of you and I come to direct you whom you shall have  HE desir'd she would talk no more to him for  says he  you cannot be my Wife it must be some evil Spirit come to tempt me in such a Shape and to destroy me  WITH that she seem'd to weep and to pity him  HE sigh'd again and desir'd that if she was able to retain any Affection to him in the Condition she  was then in that she would show it by coming no more to disorder him in that manner  SHE said  Well I will trouble you no more if you listen to the Directions I shall now give you and will perform them  WHAT are they  says he  On the first  Wednesday  in  October says she  you  ill be invited to Dinner to such a House there  ill see a Gentlewoman dress'd in white sit  gainst you at the Table she shall be your  and she will be a kind Mother to my Children  seems she gave other Particulars of the Gen  oman's Dress and in particular that she would  to him all which came to pass accordingly  TER she had said this she disppeared the Story does not say she went away with a melodious Sound or with rich Perfumes or the like as is pretended often in such like Cases nor do I remember to have heard that he married the Person tho' he really saw her at the Feast  BUT the Question from all this Story is only this  viz  Whether supposing the Case to be litterally true was this an Apparition or was it only a simple Dream I affirm it must be an Apparition that is to say a Spirit came to him in the Person of or personating his Wife  THE following Story I had from the Mouth of the very Person who was chiefly concerned in it I mean the Captain of the Ship itself  ONE Captain  Thomas Rogers  Commander of a Ship called the  Society  was bound on a Voyage from  London  to  Virginia  about the Year  THE Ship was hired in  London  and being sent light as they call it to  Virginia  for a Loading of Tobacco had not many Goods in her outward bound suppose about two or three a hundred Ton which was not counted a Loading or indeed half her  Loading the Ship being very large above five hundred Ton Burthen  THEY had had a pretty good Passage and the Day before had had an Obser  ation whereupon the Mates and proper Officers had brought their Books and cast up their Reckonings with the Captain to see how near they were to the Coasts of  America  they all agreed that they were at least about an hundred Leagues Distance from the Capes of  Virginia  Upon these customary Reckonings and withall heaving the Lead and finding no Ground at an hundred Fathom they set the Watch and the Captain turn'd in as they call it at Sea that is went to Bed  THE Weather was good a moderate Gale of Wind and blowing fair for the Coast so that the Ship might have run about twelve or fifteen Leagues in the Night aft  r the Captain was in his Cabbin  HE fell asleep and slept very soundly for about three Hours when he waked again and lay 'till he heard his second Mate  turn out  and relieve the Watch and then he call'd his chief Mate as he was going off from the Watch and ask'd him how all things far'd who answer'd that all was well and the Gale freshen'd and they run at a great Rate but 'twas a fair Wind and a fine clear Night so the Captain went to sleep again  ABOUT an Hour after he had been asleep again he dream'd that a Man pull'd him or wak'd him and he did wake I am not sure but I think he said the Thing that wak'd him bad him get up that is turn out and look abroad But whether it was so or no he lay still and compos'd himself to sl  ep and drop'  again and suddenly awak'd again and thus several times and tho' he knew nothing what was the Reason yet he found it was impossible for him to go to sleep and still he heard the  Vision say or thought he heard it say  turn out and look abroad  HE lay in this Uneasiness near two Hours but at last it encreas'd so upon him that he could lie no longer but gets up puts on his Watch Gown and comes out upon the Quarterdeck there he found his second Mate walking about and the Boatswain upon the Forecastle the Night fine and clear a fair Wind and all well as before  THE Mate wondering to see him at first did not know him but calling Who's there the Captain answer'd and the Mate returns Who the Captain what's the matter Sir  SAYS the Captain  I don't know but I have been very uneasie these two Hours and some body or my own Fancy bid me turn out and look abroad tho' I know not what can be the meaning of it  THERE can be nothing in it but some Dream  says the Mate  SAYS the Captain  How does the Ship Cape  SOUTHWEST by South  says the Mate  fair for the Coast and the Wind East by North  THAT'S all very good  says the Captain  and so after some other usual Questions he turn'd about to go back to his Cabin when as if it had been some body that stood by him had spoke it came into his Mind like a Voice  Heave the Lead heave the Lead  UPON this he turns again to his second Mate Mate  says the Captain  when did you heave the Lead what Water had you  ABOUT an Hour ago  says the Mate  sixty Fathom  Heave again  says the Captain  THERE'S no manner of Occasion Sir  says the Mate  but if you please it shall be done  I DON'T know  says the Captain  'tis needless indeed I think and so was going away again  but was as it were forc'd to turn back as before and says to the Mate I know not what ails me but I can't be easie come call a Hand aft and heave the Lead  ACCORDINGLY a Hand was called and the Lead being cast or heaved as they call it they had Ground at eleven Fathom  THIS surpriz'd them all but much more when at the next Cast it came up seven Fathom  UPON this the Captain in a Fright bad them put the Helm a Lee and about Ship all Hands being order'd to back the Sails as is usual in such Cases  THE proper Orders being obeyed the Ship stay'd presently and came about and when she was about before the Sails fill'd she had but four Fathoms and a half Water under her Stern as soon as she filled and stood off they had seven Fathom again and at the next Cast eleven Fathom and so on to twenty Fathom so he stood off to Seaward all the rest of the Watch to get into deep Water 'till Daybreak when being a clear Morning there were the Capes of  Virginia  and all the Coast of  America  in fair View under their Stern and but a very few Leagues Distance Had they stood on but one Cable's length farther as they were going they had been  Bump ashore  so the Sailors call it and had certainly lost their Ship if not their Lives  NOW what could this be Not the  Devil  that we may vouch for him he would hardly be guilty of doing so much good hardly an Angel sent from Heaven Express that we dare not presume but that it was the Work of a waking Providence by some invisible Agent employ'd for that Occasion who took Sleep from the Captain's Eyes as once in a Case of infinitely more Importance was done to King  Ahasuerus  This we may conclude Had the Captain slept as usual and as Nature requir'd  they had been all lost the Shore being flat at a great Distance and as I suppose the Tide low the Ship had been aground in an Instant and the Sea which run high would have broke over her and soon have dash'd her in Pieces  HOW it happen'd that the Mates and other Navigators on Board for it being a very great Ship they had several experienc'd Men among them should all of them have kept and yet all be out in their Reckoning and that so much as to think themselves an hundred Leagues from the Coast when they were not above twenty or twenty five that was to be accounted for among themselves but certain it was if it had not been for thus being wak'd and jogg'd in the Night and kept awake too in spite of his own Drowsiness the Captain had lain still and the whole Ship's Company been in the utmost Hazard  IF this was not an Apparition it must be what the Scripture calls it in another Case being  warned of God in a Dream  which by the way is the same thing but here was something more than being warned for the Captain own'd he was in no Dream He dream'd nothing at all much less any thing of Danger he went to his Bed or Cabbin with all the prudent Caution that any Man in that important Trust of a Ship in the Ocean could do and then after having made their Calculations cast up their Reckonings set their Watch and made every thing sure he laid down with all the Satisfaction that it was possible for any Man in a like Case to have  TO any Men that understand the Sea Affairs this Case will be more feelingly and sensibly read they will be more touch'd with the Surprize the Ship's Company must be all in to see themselves just running aground when they believed themselves an hundred Leagues from the Shore to  find themselves within two Inches of Death when they believ'd themselves as safe as a Ship at Sea with a moderate Gale and a fair Wind could be supposed to be  AND how will those modern Wits of which our Age is so full account for this who allow no God or Providence no invisible World no Angelick kind and waking Spirits who by a secret Correspondence with our embodied Spirits give merciful Hints to us of approaching Mischiefs and impending Dangers and that timely so as to put the Means into our Hands to avoid and escape them  WHICH way will such Men solve the main Difficulty in such a Case as this  viz  What this should be Will they resolve it all into fortuitous Chance meer Accident a meer Circulation of things in the ordinary Course As they say Shoals are raised to bar up a Haven which they tell us is nothing but the Sand and Stones driven down the Stream of a River which lodge here or there as their own Weight or the abating Force of the Water or this or that Eddy and Counterstream checks them so deep'ning one Channel where it was Shoal and choaking up another where it was deep and all by meer Accident But this is very gross arguing  IT were easie to confute these weak pretences to Chance and Incident and to show the necessity of an intelligent Being but that is not my work I am not upon the Reality of such an intelligent Being but the Reality of its ordinary and extraordinary actings the Agents it employs and the manner of their executing the Commissions they receive which 'tis evident they faithfully perform and effectually too sometimes by one method sometimes by another and particularly by this of Apparition as well to the Eyes of the Soul as to the Eye of the Body sleeping or waking 'tis the same  OUR Friends the Criticks may stumble here perhaps at the seeming contradiction in the Terms as particularly this of invisible Apparition But 'tis easily solv'd by answering that it is but a seeming Contradiction for both the Apparitions are visible only not to the same Optick Powers the Apparition in Dream is visible to the intellectual sight to the Eye of the Soul and the Daylight Apparition is visible to the common ordinary sight and you have an Expression in the Scripture often made use of which gives an unquestion'd Authority for this way of speaking  THE expressing things dream'd of as things seen is very frequent in the Sacred Text  Jacob  dream'd a Dream about  Laban  's Cattle  Gen  xxxi where 'tis thus expressed  and I saw in a Dream  Again  Daniel  vii  Daniel  had a Dream and Visions of his Head upon his Bed v  and I saw in my Vision by Night  v after this I saw in  the Night Visions and behold a fourth Beas    and v  I saw in the Night Visions and behold  and besides this we have the same way of speaking ten or eleven times in the same Chapter and as many or more times in the next  'TIS the like in relating the Dreams of  Pharaoh  and of  Nebuchadnezzar  or the Apparitions rather which appear'd to those Kings in Dream  Pharaoh  says to  Joseph Gen  xli In my Dream  I stood upon the Bank of the River and  BEHOLD  there came up  that is the same thing as I saw them come up v and BEHOLD  seven other Kine came up  or I saw seven other Kine come up So that an Apparition in Dream is visible to the Soul the Imagination sees tho' the Eyes of the Body are clos'd  THIS Digression is owing to the nice Judgment of our Criticks whose exactness you see I mightily reverence and am wonderful careful not to fall under  their dreadful Hands in a thing so essential to my Subject as for Trifles I leave them to trifle with them to the utmost of their more malicious Impotence  BUT I come now to another Relation of Fact which also I take upon me to vouch the Reality of having been present at the very instant of every part of it  A PERSON whose Name it is not so proper to mention here but who may be produc'd if there should be occasion being still living was under the disaster about the Year to fall under a Party Censure the occasion is needless to the present Case In hopes upon the Recess of the House which was not far off he should as is usual be at Liberty he withdrew himself and avoided being taken up as much as he could but the House resenting it a Vote was past ordering the Secretary of State to prosecute him at Law which oblig'd him to resolve to leave the Kingdom and in the mean time to conceal himself with more exactness the Government having issued out a Proclamation for apprehending him with a Reward to the Person who should discover where he was so as he might be taken  IN order to conceal himself more effectually he left his Lodging where he had been hid for some time and remov'd to  Barnet  on the Edge of  Hertfordshire  intending as soon as he had settled some Family Affairs to go away North into  Scotland  But before he went away he was oblig'd to come once more to  London  to sign some Writings for the securing some Estate which it was fear'd might be seiz'd by Outlaw if the Prosecution had gone on so far  THE Night before he had appointed to come to  London  as above being in Bed with one Mr  RD  he dream'd that he was in his Lodgings at  London  where he had been conceal'd as above and  in his Dream he saw two Men come to the Door who said they were  Messengers  and produc'd a Warrant from the Secretary of State to apprehend him and that accordingly they seiz'd upon and took him  THE Vision surpriz'd and wak'd him and he waked Mr  D  his Brotherinlaw who was in Bed with him and told him the Dream and what a Surprize he was in about it Mr  D  seeing it was but a Dream advis'd him to give no heed to it but compose himself and go to sleep again and he did so  AS soon as he was fast asleep again he was wak'd again with the same Dream exactly as before and he awak'd his Brother again as before  It disturb'd them both very much but being heavy to sleep they both went to sleep again and dream'd no more It is to be observ'd that he saw the very Men that apprehended him their Countenances Cloaths Weapons c and describ'd them in the Morning to his said Brother  D  in all the Particulars  HOWEVER the Call to go to  London  being as he thought urgent he got ready in the Morning to go resolving to stay but one Day and then set forward for  Scotland  Accordingly he went for  London  in the Morning and that he might not be known walk'd it on Foot that so he might go by more private ways over  Enfield Chase  and so to  Southgate Hornsey  c  ALL the way as he walk'd his Mind was heavy and oppress'd and he frequently said to his Brother who walk'd with him that he was certain he was going to  London  to be surpriz'd and so strong was the foreboding Impression upon his Mind that he once stop'd at  Hornsey  and endeavoured to get a Lodging intending to send his Brother to  London  to see if nothing had happen'd there to give him any Alarm  AS he had just secured a convenient Lodging he accidentally saw a Gentleman standing at the next Door who he knew very well but durst not venture to trust on that Occasion and finding on Enquiry that he dwelt there he concluded that was no Place for him and so resolv'd to go forwards  THE Impression upon his Mind continuing he stop'd again at  Islington  and endeavour'd to get a Lodging there but could not so at last when his Brother brought him word he could not get a Lodging except where it was too publick Well say  he than I must go to  London  and take what follows or to that purpose and accordingly did go and the next Morning was taken by the Messengers just in the very manner as he had been told in his Dream and the very same two Men whose Faces he had seen and with the same Cloaths on and Weapons exactly as he had describ'd  THIS Story I had from his own Mouth and confirmed by Mr  RD  his Brotherinlaw to whom he related his Vision at the very Moment of it as above  I REFER it to any impartial Judgment to weigh every Circumstance of this Account the Truth of which I have not the least Reason to question and to tell me by what Powers and from what Influence could these things be perform'd if there were no invisible World and no Inhabitants there who concern'd themselves with our Affairs no good Spirits which convers'd with our embodied Spirits and gave us due intelligence notice and warning of approaching Danger  IF there is any Difficulty in this Case it seems to me to be in the Event of the thing as in the Case mention'd Why was not the Intelligence made so compleat so forcible and the Impression  so plain that the Person in whose Favour it was all done might have been effectually alarm'd his going forward stopt and consequently the Mischief which was at hand and which he had the notice of effectually prevented  IT is not indeed so easy to answer that part but it may be resolv'd into this that the Fault seems to be our own that we do not give due attention to such notice as might be sufficient to our Deliverance If an Enemy be at hand and the OutCentinel fires his Piece he does his Duty if the whole Camp does not take the Alarm but are surpriz'd the fault is their own the Man did all that was to be expected from him nor do the Officers or Generals slight the notice and say 'tis nothing but a sorry Fellow shot off his Musquet and so take no more heed to it  ON the contrary they conclude the C  ntinel is posted upon Duty he would not fire his Piece without a sufficient Cause and give a false alarm to the Camp for nothing ther  must be something extraordinary and accordingly they order the Drums to beat and immediately call to Arms  THUS if the invisible Spirits give a due alarm they do their part if they jog us and awaken us in a deep sleep and pull us again and again and give us notice that something is coming that some Danger is at the Door if we will sleep on 'till it comes if we will go on happen what happen may the kind Spirit has done its Duty discharg'd its Office and if we fall into the Mischief the fault is our own we can by no means blame the insufficiency of the Notice and say to what purpose is it seeing we had due and timely warning but would not take the hint we had due notice of the danger and would not step out of the way to avoid it the fault is wholly our own  ANOTHER Account I had a sufficient Voucher for tho' the Gentleman is now dead but I had great reason to believe the truth of it  A YOUNG Gentleman of good Birth and Fortune in the beginning of the late War with  France  had a violent inclination to see the World as he call'd it and resolv'd to go into the Army his Father was dead and had left him a good Estate that is to say between four and five hundred Pounds a Year besides his Mother's Joynture which after her Life would fall to him of course  HIS Mother earnestly entreated him not to go into the Army but prest him rather to travel and so might see the World as she said without feeling the Calamities of the War and without hazarding his Life  HE told her Travelling indeed in time of Peace was all a Gentleman could do and was at best very expensive but that now was the time a Man might see the World at the expence of the Publick and perhaps might make his Fortune too  HIS Mother represented the danger of his Life and bad him consider how many Gentlemen went into the Army and of them have few liv'd to come home again much less to rise to any degree of Preferment  HE made light of all that and told his Mother as is the general Saying of warm Heads when they push their Fortunes as they call it that if he happen'd to be knock'd on the Head there was an End of him and he was provided for  WELL Son says the old Lady I am oblig'd to submit to it you are your own Master but remember your Mother's Tears and with those Words she wept I can but entreat you not to go you have Estate enough to make you easy let those go whose narrow Circumstances make the hazard rational and let them go abroad to die that  can't tell how to live you can pay those that do go you have no need to run the Risque who do not want the Pay  HE slighted all her entreaties and told her if his Father was alive he did not doubt but he would give his Consent for he had done the same thing in his young Days  NO no Son said his Mother your Father knew better he took a Commission when he was the youngest of three Sons and had nothing to expect at home but the fate of a younger Brother but as soon as he heard that his Elder Brothers were both dead and the Estate all come to him he laid down his Arms sold his Commission and said he had no more Business in the Army and he would tell you the same thing if he was alive he used always to say that the Sword and the Book are the Portions of younger Brothers the Coach and the Equipage is for the Heir  WELL 'twas all one whatever his Mother's Arguments could do or even speaking Tears cou'd say nothing could prevail but he mortgag'd part of his Estate to purchase a Company in the first Regiment of Guards and into the Army he would go  THE Night before he sign'd the Agreement for the Company being in his Bed and fast asleep he saw in a Dream his Father come to him in his Gown and with a great Fur Cap on such as he us'd to wear And calling him by his Name What is the Reason says he that you will not listen to the entreaties of your Mother not to go to the Wars but answer her that I would not dissuade you I do assure you that if you resolve to take this Commission you will not enjoy it three Years  WHY  says he  in his Dream what wi  hinder me being it seems desirous to know something of his Fortune  ASK me not the Particulars  says the Apparition  but either decline the Employ or when you have enjoy'd it two Years and a half sell out again as I did before you  I CAN'T promise that  says he  THEN you may promise your self  says the Apparition  that it shall be worse  HE seem'd to slight the Admonition and said it was too late to look back  TOO late too late  says the Apparition  repeating the Words then go on and repent too late  HE was not much affected with this Apparition when he wak'd and found it was but a Dream for Dreams said he are not to be heeded so he went on and bought the Commission  A FEW Days after the Commission was bought the Father appear'd again not to him but to his Mother in a Dream too as before and taking notice to her how his Son had rejected her Admonition it added  YOUNG Heads are wilful  Robert  will go into the Army but tell him from me he shall never come back  ALL these Notices were of no force with this young Gentleman but as he had resolv'd so he pursued his Resolution and went into the Army and two Battallions of that Regiment going into the Field that Summer his Company was one and so he went abroad into  Flanders  HE wanted no occasion to show his Bravery and in several warm Actions come off with applause so that he was far from being suspected of Cowardise But one Day and in the third Year of his Service the Army was drawn out in order of Battel the General having receiv'd certain Advice that the Enemy would come and attack them As he stood at the Head of his Company he was suddenly seiz'd with a cold shivering Fit and it was so violent  that some Officers who were near him every one at their Post perceiv'd it  AS it was to no purpose for him to conceal it he turn'd to his Lieutenant who stood next to him and from whose Mouth I receiv'd the particular Account of it I cannot imagine  says he  what is the occasion of this shaking Fit  IT is your eagerness to fall on  says the Lieutenant  I have often been so and begin to be so now I wish the  French  would come on that we might have something to do  IT continu'd about a quarter of an Hour and the Enemy did come on as was expected but the fight began upon the left a good distance from them so that the whole left Wing was engag'd before they began  WHILE this lasted the Lieutenant call'd to the Gentleman Colonel  say  he  how do you do I hope your shivering Fit is over  NO  says the Colonel  'tis not over but 'tis a little better  IT will be all over presently  says the Lieutenant  AY so 'twill  says the Colonel  I am very easy I know what 'twas now and with that he call'd the Lieutenant to come to him for one Moment  WHEN he came  says he  I know now what ail'd me  I am very easy  I have seen my Father I shall be kill'd the first Volley let my Mother know I told you this  IN a few Minutes afte  this a Body of the Enemy advanc'd and the very first Volley the Regiment receiv'd was the fire of five Plottoons of Grenadiers by which the Captain and several other Officers besides private Men were kill'd and the whole Brigade was soon af  er put into Confusion tho' being supported by some Regiments of the second Line they rallied again soon after the Captain's Body was presently recover'd but he was  irrecoverably Dead for he receiv'd a Shot in his Face which kill'd him immediately  IF all the Notices from the invisible World could have been of any Use to him or he had been to be wrought upon by Cautions and Advices which nothing but a most obstinate Temper would have so totally disregarded the Man had been safe But what can be expected when Men are as plainly inform'd of things as by such Methods can be suppos'd rational and will not take the Hint  LUCIUS FLORUS  records of  Julius Caesar  that a Woman of a Masculine Countenance and of a mighty Stature appeared to him in a Dream and beckon'd to him to follow her that upon his following her she went over the River  Rubicon  and stood on the farther Bank beckoning to him to come over upon which the next Day he boldly enter'd  Italy  passing the  Rubicon  which was the Boundary of  Italy  on that Side  I KNOW some relate this as an Apparition to  Caesar  in the open Day but I understand it otherwise and that it was understood of the Genius of  Italy  as they then call'd it and that he had such a Vision in his Sleep which encourag'd him in his Attempt upon the Liberty of his Country intimating that the whole Country invited him and that he might be sure of Success  I SHALL not run out here into the Account of Dreams the Variety of them is Infinite and as I hinted before few of them of Importance enough to deserve any Regard but such Dreams as necessarily intimate an Apparition of Spirits those I think must be Significant  THE following is part Vision part Apparition and seems to make One be an Evidence of the Other and therefore is very particularly to my Purpose  T    H  a Gentleman of Fortune eldest Son of the Family his Father a Baronet and of an  honourable Line and then living being a young Man and a Man of Pleasure had an Intreague with a certain Lady in which his younger Brother of the two rather more Gay and given that way than himself was his Rival The Lady was handsome and of no despicable Fortune but much inferiour to the eldest Son of the Family whose Fortune was near two thousand Pound  per Annum  after his Father Sir  G    H    THE younger Gentleman was really in Love with the Lady and inclin'd to marry her if he could bring his Father to consent to it and had two or three times spoken to the old Knight about it nor was his Father much averse to it only he thought her Fortune too small  SIR  G  told his Son if he had been his Eldest he should have been easier in the Proposal because his Paternal Estate being Free and perfectly unincumber'd he thought the Heir was not under that Necessity of making his Fortune by a Wife but that a younger Brother ought always to seek a Fortune to mend his Circumstances He us'd to jest with his Son and tell him it was this made him connive at his way of Life that a younger Brother should be Handsom be a Scholar Dress and be Gay the first to recommend him to the Court the second to recommend him to the Ladies that the Heir having no need was often left to be a Booby Knight just able to write his own Name Halloo to his own Dogs and ride the light Saddle but as he had seldom any Share of Brains Nature wisely gave the Wit  o one and the Estate to the other so says the Knight your Brother has his Affairs in a quite different Si  uation  THESE goodnatur'd kind of Arguments the old Knight us'd with his younger Son to persuade him against marrying the Lady but he did not absolutely forbid him on pain of his Displeasure and  of withdrawing his Hand from him with respect to Money so that the young Gentleman kept the Lady Company openly and though he had not yet made the Proposal to her yet did really design it I mean the honourable Proposal  viz  of Marriage  ON the other hand the Esquire as they call'd him kept her Company on another and far worse Account designing to make a Mistress of her and not a Wife  UPON these differing Views the Brothers often met at the Lady's House that is to say at her Aunt's where she liv'd for she had no Father and her Mother had chang'd Circumstances so that her Daughter was as it were in her own Hands  THE elder Brother had this Advantage in his Interest  viz  that the Lady lov'd him and would have been very well pleas'd if he had courted her for Marriage but that was not his Design so that in a word the Case stood thus the younger Brother lov'd the Lady but the Lady lov'd the Esq  THE elder Brother laid Siege to her Virtue and the younger laid Siege to her Affection but as I said the Stream running in Favour of the eldest the Lady was in some Danger of sacri  izing her Honour to her Passion and the honest Pretensions of the young Gentleman were in some Hazard of a Miscarriage  THE Gentlemen carry'd on their Affairs separately and their own way but were neither of them so close as to conceal it from one another that they had some Designs tho' they did not fully discover what their Pretensions were however as I have said that they often met at the Lady's Apartment it could not be long before they came to a Conversation upon the Subject and this unhappily embroil'd them together at last as you shall see presently  THE eldest Brother began one Evening to be a little rough with his Brother upon the Subject  Jack says the Eldest  you and I often meet here I don't understand it pray what do you pr  t  nd to 'tis a little odd that two Brothers should have but one Mistress pr'ythee  Jack  don't let us turn  Italians  NAY  says Jack  what do you pretend to If either of us is in the Wrong I believe 'tis always on your Side  NO  says T  I don't allow that neither I am right I am sure of it I am always right and I will be right pray take Notice of that  I TAKE Notice of nothing about it not I  says Jack  all the World knows that I am right and they shall know it and you shall know it too  Tom    WELL Pr'ythee  Jack says Tom  alter one Piece of your Conduct I desire that of you  WHAT Conduct I don't understand you but if I did I know no Conduct of mine that is amiss and I shall alter none of it I assure you  WHY this it is that when I meet you here which I think is a little too often  says the Esquire  I observe you always strive to stay after me and to have me go away first I tell you I don't like it  I SHALL alter nothing about that I assure you  says Jack  I think I have some Business here more than you have and as for your meeting me here too often  I think so too I think you do come a little too often unless you came with an honester Design  YOU are very Pert Mr  Jack  to your  lder Brother I think I must handle you a little  says Tom  WHY good Mr elder Brother Esquire  Thomas  ys Jack  when you are Baronet you may take upon you a little but 'till then the Cap and the Knee is not so much your due as you may think it is  LOOK you  Jack says the Esquire  I am not jesting with you nor I won't be jested with by you the be  t  Answer a Gentleman gives to a Jest is a Box on the Ear or  la coup de Batton  WHY Sir  says Jack  I must call my self a Gentleman as well as you or else I could not have the Honour to call you Brother And since you are dispos'd to be in Earnest I take leave to tell you Sir I will be us'd like a Gentl  man and if you don't know how to do it I am able to teach you  THEY were now both very hot for upon the last Words of his Brother the Esquire laid hold of his Cane at which the younger laid hold of his Sword Look you Sir says he if you are dispos'd to treat your Brother thus take Notice Sir my Father's Son may be kill'd but he can't be can'd and I won't take the least Offer towards it at your Hand I am ready for you when you please  SOME Company that were not far off and Friends to both ran in upon this and kept them asunder for that time but they soon met again at the same Place and tho' it was two or three Days or more yet they soon began the same kind of Discourse and which was still worse the elder Brother who was certainly in the Wrong yet always began the Discourse  IT happen'd they met the last time at the Lady's Lodgings and were let into her Parlour but the Lady was very unhappily abroad she had charg'd her Maid if ever the Gentlemen cam  when she was abroad she should never let them both in or at least not both into the same Room for she had perceiv'd they began to be very uneas  e one with another she knew they were both hot and angry and she was afraid of some Mischief between them notwithstanding they were Brothers  BUT some of her Aunt's Servants happening t  come to the Door when the eldest of the Gentlemen knock'd they carry'd him into the sam  Parlour where the younger Brother was waiting before for the Lady's Return  THIS was as unluckily pointed for what follow'd as if the  Devil  who is always ready for Mischief had contriv'd it on Purpose for the Brothers were no sooner met but they fell to quarrelling  WELL  Jack says the  ld  r Brother  you will it seems keep your Haunt her  notwithstanding what I said to you  I DO not really understand what you mean by your way of talking  says Jack  you seem to take a Liberty with me you have n  right to  WHAT Liberty do I take  says the Esquire  I ask'd you what Business you had here with Mrswas that taking too much Liberty and I ask you again is that an Offence  AND I told you  says Jack  I should give you no Account of my self did not I was that an Offence to you If it was I see no help for it I shall give you the same Answer now I cannot imagine what you mean by asking me such a Question  I KNOW what I mean by it and I shall expect a better Answer I tell it you in a few Words  says the Esquire  NAY if you have a Mind to make a Quarrel of it you a  e welcome  says Jack  I'll make as few Words as you please Only let me know your Pleasure tell me what you would have and you shall have a direct Answer or a direct Refusal at once  WHY my Question is short  says the Esquire  What do you visit Mrsfor you may  asily understand me  I SHALL answer it with the same Qu  s  ion  says Jack  Pray what do you visit her for  WHY that's as rude as you can answer an eld  r Brother  says the Esquire  and as spi  ful but few  Words are best  Jack  I visit her for that which bears no Rivals I hope you understand me now  WELL and I do the same  says Jack  but there is one Question between us then that carries matter of Right with it and that is who visited her first  WHY that's true  Jack says the Esquire  in some Cases but not  in Love  Priority is no Claim there I shall not trouble my self about it  THEN I'm sure  says Jack  being an elder Brother is no Claim so I shall take no Notice of that  NO no  says the Esquire  I don't expect it there are no Relatives in whoring  Jack  I know no Brother or Father Uncle or Cousin when I talk of my Mistress  VERY well  says Jack  now you have answer'd me more particularly than it may be you intended and perhaps we may come to an Understanding sooner than I expected  WHAT do you mean  says the Esquire  by an Understanding  NAY what can I mean I mean that you give me to understand that you court Mrsto make a Whore of her  BETTER Language  Jack  however  says the Esquire  a Mistress you would say  NOT I  says Jack  'twill bear no better Language a Whore's a Whore you know call it what you will 'tis the same thing to me  WELL and suppose it then what Business have you with it  WHY suppose then that I Court the same Lady for a Wife I hope I have the better of you there  NOT at all  Jack says the Esquire  I shan't allow you should make a Wife of my Mistress  NOR I can't allow  says Jack  that you shall make a Whore of my Wife  BUT I shall make no Scruple of it I assure you  says the Esquire  if she is willing for all you are my Brother I shall do it if I can  AND I won't flatter you that let her be willing or not willing if you really do it  says Jack  I shall make no Scruple to cut your Throat for it if I can for all you are my Brother  VERY well  Jack says the Esquire  then I know what I have to trust to  IT'S very true  says Jack  'tis the old Road of Knight Errantry Sir win her and wear her is the Word  AND what must be done then  says the Esquire  NAY  says Jack  I need not tell you what to do I tell you she's my Wife I think that's enough to tell you what you ought to do  AND I tell you  says the Esquire  she's my Mistress that's enough to tell you you are a Cuck  ld or shall be so I think that's fair to tell you beforehand  AND I think  says Jack  that's telling me I must cut your Throat beforehand too for I will neither be a Cuckold or be call'd so by you or any Man alive  N B  AT this the younger Brother rose up in a violent Rage and went away and the elder Brother as hot as he told him as he went out  he did well  to leave him  in Possession  THIS urg'd him yet more and he turn'd back and said I hope you will have the Manners to follow me  NO  Jack says the Esquire  and swore to him you shan't fight for my Mistress and my Estate too I'll take care first you shall get nothing by me  WITH all my Heart  says Jack  we give a Rogue time at the Gallows to say his Prayers you know  I SHALL correct you for your Impudence Sir tomorrow Morning without fail  says the Esquire  MUST I wait upon your Worship so long  says Jack  and added something very bitter as if his Brother w  s too much a Coward to go on with it But it appeared otherwise for that very Evening he receiv'd a Challenge from the Esquire appointing Time and Place to meet the next Day by Five in the Morning  THESE two rash hotheaded young Fellows were carried into this Fit of Rage by the Violence rather of their fiery Spirits and Passions than of their real J  alousy for they had scarce either of them begun to engage with the Lady one way or another but being hot and heady they raised the Storm between themselves and the Match and the Tinder meeting the Flame broke out by the meer Nature of the thing  BUT my Business is not to moralize upon the Story but to relate the Fact The Challenge being given they had no more to do but to meet fight play the Butcher upon one another and leave the Consequences to Time  THE Father the good old Knight who was then living could know nothing of what had pass'd between his Sons for he was at that very time down at his Country Seat in  Wshire  at least sixty Miles from  London  ON the Morrow early according to Agreement the Brothers prepar'd themselves for the Business and out they went but by several Ways to the Place appointed their Lodgings being in different Parts of the Town  THE younger Brother whose Blood it seems was warmest was first out and it was scarce Daylight when he came within Sight of the Place appointed there he saw his Brother as he supposed him to be walking hastily to and fro as if he waited with Impatience for his coming  NAY  says he to himself  I am sure I am within the Time however don't be impatient Brother  Tom  I'll be with you presently and with that he mended his Pace He had not gone many Steps more but he saw his Brother as he still thought him to be coming forward as if it was to meet him and with his Sword drawn in his Hand  YOU are mighty nimble with your Sword said he again to himself what did you think I would not give you time to draw But how was he surprized when he came up to him and found it was not his Brother but his Father and that instead of a Sword in his Hand he had nothing but a small little Cane such as the old Knight generally walk'd with  HE was the more at a stand because he suppos'd his Father was as is said above at his Seat in the Country above sixty Miles off However he was out of doubt when he not only saw him nearer hand but that his Father spoke to him  WHY how now  Jack says the old Gentleman  What  When he thought he saw his Brother with his Sword in his Hand he had laid his Hand on his Sword  challenge and draw upon your Father  YOU may be sure Sir  says he  I did not suppose it was you I don't doubt you know whom I expected here 'tis a poor cowardly Shift for him first to challenge his Brother and then send you in his stead you would not have done so your self when you was a young Man  'TIS no time to talk now  Jack says his Father  I have your Challenge here and I am come to fight you not to talk to you therefore draw  says he  you know there's no Relation in Love and wi  h that his Father draws his Sword and advances upon him  DRAW  says Jack  what and upon my Father Heaven's forbid no I'll be murther'd first  BUT his Father advancing again and with a furious Countenance as if he would indeed kill him  Jack  pulls out his Sword and Scabbard and throwing it on the Ground cry'd out There Sir take it kill me with it for God's sake what do you mean  BUT his Father as it were running upon him  Jacks  turns from him and giving a spring out of his Power seems resolv'd to run from him at which his Father stoops takes up his Sword and stood still  THE young Gentleman surpris'd and amaz'd at the Rencounter was all in Terror and Confusion and knew not what to do but going back a considerable Way and observing that his Father was gone as he thought he resolved tho' he had no Sword he would go the Place appointed and see if his Brother was come for he should not be able to say he did not meet him however he was thus strangely disarm'd  ACCORDINGLY he went back to the Place and sat him down upon the Ground waiting near two Hours there but heard nothing of his Brother but as he came away again at the End of the two Hours he found his Sword lying just in the Place where it was thrown down or as near the Place as he could imagine tho' he was sure it was not there when he went the second time by the Place  THIS amus'd him more and he knew not what to make of it but he took up the Sword and went home wondring at what the meaning of all this should be  HE had not been long at home but his Brother's Servant comes to his Lodging with a very civil Message from the Esquire to know how he  did and the Servant was bid to ask him from his Brother if he had not met with something extraordinary that Morning and to tell him that he his Brother was very ill or he would ha' come to see him  THE Oddness of the Message added to the Surprise he was in before upon which he call'd the Messenger up Stairs and parlied with him a little thus  J  WHAT'S the matter  Will  how does my Brother do  Will  MY Master gives his Service to your Worship and sent me to know how you do  J  INDEED I'm out of order a little but how is your Master what's the matter  Will  WHY truly and't please your Worship I don't know what's the matter I think my Master has been frighted this Morning  J  FRIGHTED  Will  with what pry'thee your Master is not easily frighted  Will  WHY no an't please you I know he is not but this has been something extraordinary I don't know how 'tis for I was not with my Master but they talk in the House that he has seen his Father or seen an Apparition in the Shape of his Father  J  WHY so have I too  Will  now you fright me indeed for I made light of it before why it was my Father to be sure  Will  No Sir alas your Father why my old Master was atin  W    shire  and very ill in his Bed but a  Friday  last I came from him my Master sent me to him on an Errand  J  AND did you see him your self  Will  Will  IF your Worship please to give me my Oath I'll take my Oath I saw him and spoke with him in his Bed and very ill he was I hope your Worship will believe I know my old Master  J  YES yes you know him no doubt  Will  I think you liv'd four Years with him didn't you  Will  I dress'd him and undress'd him five Years and a half  an't please you  I think I may say I know him in his Cloaths or out of 'em  J  WELL  William  and I hope you will allow that I may know my own Father too or him I ha' call'd Father these thirty Years  Will  YES to be sure an't please you  J  WELL then tell my Brother it was either my Father or the  Devil  I both saw him and spoke with him and I'm frighted out of my Wits  AWAY went  Will  with this Message back to his Master and his Master immediately goes again with  Will  to see his Brother  AS soon as he came into the Room to his Brother he runs to him and kisses him Dear  Jack says he  What has been the matter with us today we have both play'd the Fool but forgive me my Part and tell me what has happen'd  JACK  receiv'd him with all the Passions and Tenderness imaginable and they fell immediately to comparing things with one another  Will  had told his Brother in general how it was as the younger Brother had order'd him that he had seen his Father and spoke to him and now he told him all the Particulars himself as I have related them above  and how he came at him with such Fury that he really thought he would have run him thro' the Body and that he run away  THE Squire related his Story much to the same purpose How that as he was coming to the Place appointed his Father met him and ask'd him whither he was going that he put him off with a slight Answer and told him he was going to  Kensington  to meet some Gentlemen there who were to go with him to  HamptonCourt  THAT upon this his Father turn'd very angry and I observ'd  said he  his Face look'd as red as Fire he stamp'd with his Foot as he us'd to do when he was provok'd and told me I put him off with a Sham that he knew my Errand as well as I did my self that I was going to murther my younger Brother and that he was come to satisfy my Fury with his Blood and I should murther him not my Brother  I was so confounded  said the Esquire  I could not speak to him a good while but recovering my self a little and going to excuse my self he gr  w more angry when I said my Pretensions were as honest to Mrsas yours were he gave me the Lye and indeed  Jack  I deserv'd it tho' I could not imagine he knew but he told me in short that I lyed for that I courted her to debauch her but that you courted her honourably to marry her and he had given his Consent to it  I WAS confounded then begg'd his Pardon so he bad me go Home and be reconciled to my Brother or that he would talk other Language to me the next time he saw me and now dear  Jack says the Esquire  I am come to ask your Pardon not only in Obedience to my Father but really on my own Account for I am convinc'd I was in the wrong to you very much  YOU may be sure the Brothers were immediately as good Friends as ever they were in their Lives But still  Jack  was uneasy about this being the real Appearance of his Father and his Brother's M  n  William  's Words run in his Mind all that Night for as to this first Meeting it was so taken up with the Ecstasies of their Reconciliation that they had no time for any thing else  BUT the next Morning the young Gentleman went to see his Brother to return his Visit and talk things over again  DEAR Brother  says Jack  I am very uneasy about one Part of our Story still I am glad from my Soul that you and I are brought to understand one another and I hope it shall never be otherwise but I cannot be thoroughly satisfy'd about who it was that was the Peacemaker if wha  your Man  Will  says be true it cou'd never be my Father  NAY  says his Brother Will  told me that you said it was my Father or the  Devil  WHY yes I did say so  says Jack  but that was to intimate my Certainty of its not being my Father not that I suppos'd it was the  Devil  But pray how long has my Father been in Town  NAY  says the Esquire  I did not know that he is in Town but that I saw him I know well enough  BUT did not you send  Will  down to him says  Jack  into the Country and is it possible he could come up since that in so little time  YES yes he might come up  says the Esquire  he often drives it in a Day and a piece sometimes in a Day six Horses go at a great rate you know  BUT pray what think you of it yourself you saw him as well as I Was it really my Father Your Man  Will  talks that 'twas impossible besides he says my Father was very ill and kept his Bed  WILL  does say he was much out of Order but he did not say he kept his Bed but I confess I never enter'd into that Dispute in my Thoughts 'Twas my Father sure What else could it be As you said Brother it must be my Father or the  Devil  NAY I don't know what to say neither Brother  says Jack  as to its being the  Devil  I believe the  Devil  and my Father have no manner of Correspondence  BESIDES Brother  says the Esquire  how should the  Devil  owe you and I so much Goodwill as to concern himself to reconcile us I believe he had much rather have seen us murther one another as we were in a fair way to have done  I RATHER believe  says Jack  he had a Hand in making us Quarrel  AY indeed so do I  says the Esquire  I think for my Part I was mad and as folks commonly say the  Devil  was in me or I should never have been such a Fool  WELL but Brother  says the young Gentleman  how shall we come at the bottom of this Matter we both think it was my Father and we both think it can hardly be him neither and we both think it was not the  Devil  AY and  says the Esquire  if it should not be my Father nor the  Devil  neither what shall we say then  WHY that indeed makes me so impatient to have it out now I'll tell you one thing which allarms me a little too I have sent to Mr's where you know my Father always lodges and to the  BlackSwanYard  where you know his Coach stands and they all say he is not in Town and that he is to be in Town about six Weeks hence  WHY that's extraordinary too I confess  says the Esquire  I never thought of it because I never entertain'd any Jealousy of this kind it was quite out of my Head but upon my Word you make me very uneasy about it now  FOR my part  says his younger Brother  I would give any thing to come to a Certainty about it I cou'd almost take my Horse and go down on purpose  I'LL go with you with all my Heart  says the Esquire  TO bring the Matter to a conclusion the two Brothers agreed and they went both away to see their Father The very Day they took Horse to go down but some Hours after they were gone a Letter came in to the elder Brother's House from their Father the Contents of which I shall take Notice of presently  AND first I am to observe that when they came to their Father they found him at home and very ill nor had he been from home and was greatly concern'd for the Safety of his Sons upon the following Occasion  THE Night before he wrote the Letter spoken of above he was surpriz'd in his Sleep with a Dream or rather a Vision that his two Sons had fallen out about a Mistress that they had Quarrell'd to that degree that they had challeng'd one another and were gone out into the Fields to fight but that some body had given him Notice of it and that he had got up in the Morning by four a Clock to meet and prevent them  UPON this Dream he awak'd in great Disorder and Terror however finding it but a Dream he had compos'd his Mind and gotten to sleep again but that he dream'd it again in so lively a manner that he was forc'd to call up his Man that waited on him to sit up the rest of the Night with him and he was frighted and much out of order with the Fright  That in Consequence of this Dream he had sent a Servant up Express with Orders to ride Night and Da  to enquire how his Sons did and to bring him word if there had been any such breach among them and earnestly to press them if such a breach had been that they would consent to let him mediate between them that it might go no farther 'till he could come up that so he might put an end to their Resentments and make Peac  among them according to his Dreams and this was the Letter mention'd above that came to Hand in a few Hours after they were set out  IT cannot be doubted but it was very confounding to his Sons to hear the Account their Father gave them of his Dream or Vision rather about their Quarrel and it was equally amazing to see it confirm'd by all the true Particulars also that the old Gentleman to be sure had been so far from being at  London  that he had scarce been a whole Day off from his Bed  THEY conferr'd together seriously upon the private Question  viz  whether they should tell their Father the Story of their Quarrel but especially of their seeing him severally and his really parting them or preventing their fighting  UPON the whole they concluded not to let their Father know of his Likeness as they call'd it appearing to them lest it might disquiet him too much and for the rest as they were perfectly reconcil'd again they said there was no manner of Occasion to mention it at all so they only paid their Compliment as a Visit of Duty to see how he did and to ask his Blessing  Will  having told them that he was out of Order and as for his Letter they could happily tell him they had not seen it  ACCORDING to this Resolution they perform'd the Ceremony of Visiting their Father and made haste away again that they might converse the more freely about this strange Conjunction of Circumstances which had in it so many things surprizing to their Thoughts and even to their Understandings for they knew not what to make of it nor indeed could they resolve it into any thing but this which is to my purpose exactly and which is the reason of my mentioning the whole  Story namely that here was a double Apparition within the compass of our propos'd System  HERE was the Apparition of the living Person of their Father without his participation in the Action his Face Voice and perhaps Habit was assum'd and yet he himself knew nothing of the Matter was not in the least concerned in it or acquainted with it  HERE was an Apparition to the Father in Dream 'twas a plain Vision the thing that was true in Fact was reveal'd to him in his Sleep which is the very Subject I am now speaking of The Sons were represented or appear'd to him Quarrelling and in a state of Feud as they really were and yet neither of them knew any thing of the Matter  FROM hence supposing the Reality of the Story it necessarily follows that a Spirit or invisible Being let it be call'd what we please may take upon it the Shape Face Voice of any living Person whom it pleases to represent without the Knowledge Consent or Concurrence of the Person so represented in any manner whatsoever  AND from hence also it is evident that Dreams are sometimes to be call'd and really are Apparitions as much as those other visible Apparitions which are seen when we are as we call it broad awake that Apparition is to the Eyes of the Soul and as it is so it may be seen as well sleeping as waking for the Imagination sleeps not the Soul ceases indeed to act organically but it ceases not to act as a Soul and in a spirituous Manner and consequently can act upon spirituous Objects and that as well in Sleep as at any other time  I COULD load this Account with Story for Example is frequent in these Cases and I am forc'd to leave out some which are very good and would be entertaining because they are too  edious for the Work besides I am not pretending to write a Collection of old Stories if I did I should call it a History of all the ChimneyCorners in the three Kingdoms However I must not leave you barren of Examples neither in Cas  so pregnant take one more which my Author assures me was never in Print  A CERTAIN Lady of good Figure and some Quality had a terrible Quarrel with her Husband upon the great and critical Points of Virtue and Honour he was a Gentleman of publick Business and pass'd for a Man of Sense but had that particular Infirmity which with me will always pass for a deficiency in the Understanding I mean to be jealous of his Wife and yet to be able to fix nothing upon her no not so much as a just blot upon her Conversation  'TIS very hard for a Man to be Fool enough to disquiet himself on such an Account and not be Knave enough to make it uneasy to his Wife too I say Knave because where there is no just cause of Reproach he cannot be an honest Man that loads his Wife with the Scandal of it  HE had thought fit to use her very ill upon this Subject many times with no manner of Foundation nay indeed not so much as a pretence for it except what was to be fetch'd from his own bewildred Imagination and he gave himself up so much to his Jealousy without grounds that his Wife was oblig'd to lay her Condition before some of her Relations who took upon them to talk with him about it  THIS talking with him had a worse Effect than was expected for the Man was so far from being influenced by the friendly Expostulations of his Wife's Kindred that he grew rude and abusive to them and if any one of them spoke a little warmer than ordinary in her favour he turn'd it presently  upon that Person as if he had been the Man and had been naught with her and yet when one of them challeng'd him to give any one Instance of his Wife's Conduct or of any Person's associating with her in a manner as shou'd give an honest Man the least grounds of suspicion he could not assign the least Reason but as is most true in ordinary that those who are the most Jealous have oftentimes the least Cause for it so it was here yet notwithstanding all the Expostulations that were or could be used with him the coolest Reasonings and most friendly Persuasions he continued to use his Wife so ill that her Friends began to think it necessary to part them  THE Lady a Woman of Piety as well as Virtue tho' griev'd heartily with the ill Usage and particularly as it reproach'd her Virtue yet was loath to unhinge her Family and separate from her Husband having also two Children which she could not part with her Affection not suffering her to leave them to want the Care and Conduct of a Mother so she chose rather to bear his daily ill Usage of her than to leave her Family  BUT he carried the Bruitish Part so far at length that not content to use her in the most scandalous manner with his Tongue he fell upon her with his Hands and two or three times in his Rage abus'd her very much she conceal'd this part for his sake as much as she could and endeavour'd to prevent its being known  BUT he took care to expose himself in it upon many Occasions and particularly by affronting a Gentleman of his own Acquaintance and some Relation to him too the Case was thus He fell to charging his Wife with dishonesty in his ordinary Discourse and before Strangers upon which the Gentleman said Fye Cousin really I believe you wrong her at least you should be very sure  you were in the right before you talk'd so your Lady has a general Character of an honest modest and virtuous Woman and I am told she is a very pious and religious Person also  AT this he flew out in a Passion and said Dher he was satisfy'd she was a Whore  BUT Cousin says the Gentleman then I suppose you know the Person too and could prove the Fact  HE believ'd he did  he said  NAY you ought to be very sure of it Cousin says he before you charge your Wife so positively  HE answer'd without any manner of Respect to his Cousin I believe you are the Man and adds I take it for granted  WHAT Suspicion  says the Gentleman  did I ever give you of it I was never in your Wife's Company in my Life but when you were present  'TIS no matter for that  says he  if you were not guilty why should you concern yourself to vindicate her  THE Gentleman tho' greatly provok'd kept his Temper still and smil'd at him Cousin  says he  I doubt you have no better Argument to prove your Wife's Guilt than you have mine and if you han't she's as inno  nt as a sucking Child  HIS Smiling provok'd him and he gave the Gentleman the Lie and added some very scurrilous Language to it such as might be expected from a Madman a Man out of himself not by Lunacy as a Dist  mper but by that worse Frenzy call'd groundless Jealousy  AS giving the Lie is the last Injury one Man can do to another with his Tongue it so provok'd his Cousin that scorning to draw his Sword upon him he corrected him heartily for it with his Cane as he deserv'd and he again like a true Coward  when they were go  reveng'd himself upon hi  Wife for he abus'd her again in a bruitish and barbarous Manner nor did it pacify him at all that he vented his Rage thus upon his Wife at that time but he continued it upon every Occasion of his being harrass'd with his own Jealousy and whenever he abus'd his Wife after that time he upbraided her with this Gentleman and with her still keeping him Company tho' as it appear'd afterwards the Gentleman was not in  England  nor had been for several Months  IT happened one time in particular that coming home not at all in Drink but very much out of Humour and as it seem'd provok'd tho' it could not be so much as guess'd at what the Reason was he pick'd a Quarrel with his Wife and without any other Provocation than what was to be found in his own want of Temper fell foul of her in a most unmerciful manner and had not Help been fetch'd in 'twas fear'd he would have murther'd her In a Word Neighbours coming in to her rescue saved her from farther Mischief yet before them all he bad her go out of the House and forbid her coming any more within his Doors  THE Lady could not now avoid what she had so long been persuaded to before so taking some Cloaths and her own Jewels which she brought to him she withdrew the same Evening to her own Brother's House taking sufficient Witness of the occasion of it  BUT to bring this Story nearer to the Case in Hand The Gentleman whom he had thus ill us'd had on some occasions of his own been oblig'd about five Months before this last Broil to go over to  Germany  and as he went from  England  by Sea and landed at  H  mburgh  he travell'd from  Hamburgh  up to  Magdeburgh  and from thence to  Leipsick  in  Saxony  AS he was sitting alone in a SummerHouse as we call it or  GardenHouse  as they more properly call it there belonging to a Burgher of  Leipsick  and reading a Book to divert himself being in the heat of the Day and a little after Dinner he dropt asleep and dream'd that a Lady was come from  England  to speak with him and was in the House waiting for him  UPON this Dream and being not very sound asleep only leaning his Head on his Hand as he was reading he wak'd and as soon as he wak'd he started up and intended to go into the House to see who it should be when immediately he sees a Lady in an  English  dress coming up the Garden towards the SummerHouse  HE did not know her at first but when she came nearer she spoke to him he calling her by her Name would have saluted her but she seem'd to decline it and stepping back said You and I Sir have been sufficiently abus'd upon that Head already and I come to you for Justice I am ill us'd and in danger of being murther'd every Day by my cruel Husband on your Account and am at last turn'd out of Doors  ALAS  says he  Madam he is a Brutish Man and I am very sorry but what can I do for you  YOU know my Innocence  says she  as far as relates to yourself do me justice I ask no more and that moment she disappear'd  HE was extremely surpriz'd as he might well be indeed and the more because he had not the least notion of its being an Apparition no more had the Burgher's Servant who let her in at the Door and waited on her up the Garden to the SummerHouse  HE went immediately back into the House and enquir'd who let the Lady into the House and the Servant that had usher'd her up the Walk in  the Garden told him he did and also that he had that Minute let her out again but looking out into the Street nothing of her could be seen again or did he ever see or hear any more of her in that manner  WHILE this pass'd the Lady liv'd a very melancholly retir'd Life in her Brother's Family seeing no Company and spending her time in a most uncomfortable Solitude especially grieved for the Reproach so causelesly rais'd upon her Character and having nothing to comfort her but the knowledge of her own Innocence that which we call the Comfort of a good Conscience which as the World goes now I must be cautious how I lay too much stress upon or moralize too much upon lest I should be call'd Religious and Grave which is as much as to say Mad  THIS Separation continu'd some time all endeavours to bring it to a Reconciliation had been try'd but prov'd ineffectual the Husband continuing insolently abusive to his Wife and his Wife Things being carry'd to such a height insisting upon a Reparation of the Injury offer'd to her Reputation by having either the Facts prov'd or a due Cause of Suspicion assigned Between both a Reconciliation seem'd impracticable and Friends on both sides having done their utmost began to give it over  BUT to the agreeable surprize of all that wish'd well to the Family the Husband comes one Morning to his Wife's Brother all alone and ask'd to speak with his Wife  HER Brother was a litttle doubtful at first what Answer to give him and particularly was afraid to bring his Sister forth to him not knowing what the  Devil  and an exasperated Temper might prompt him to and he perceiving it said with a quite differing Tone from what he us'd to talk with  You need not be afraid Brother to let me see my Wife tho' indeed I have given you all Cause enough to be uneasy but I assure you I will soon satisfy you that I do not come to do her any harm but just the contrary I come to put an end to all this wicked Breach and that in a manner as shall be to your Satisfaction and hers too and I am very willing you shall be present when I speak to her for I desire you should hear what I have to say  HE spoke it with such an apparent Alteration in his Temper that it was easy to see that he was quite another Man and that there was no hazard in letting him see her so he went and acquainted his Wife with what had pass'd who tho' she was a little afraid at first yet upon her Brother's persuasions came down and her Brother led her into the Room to him in his Hand  AS soon as he saw his Wife he run to her and took her in his Arms and kiss'd her holding her fast but was not able to speak a word for some time At last getting a little vent of his Passion My Dear  says he  I have wrong'd and abus'd you and I come to acknowledge it in as publick a manner as possible I can I come to ask you Pardon for it and am ready to declare my full satisfaction of your Innocence in as open a manner as ever the  Devil  and my own ungovern'd Passion inflam'd me against you Make your own Demands what Satisfaction I shall make you and what Security I shall give you that you shall have no more such Treatment I am ready to comply with them and go home with me if you dare trust me The Moment I break my Promise to you in the least Circumstance you shall freely remove again without the least hindrance or the least Contradiction from me in the mean time depend upon it you shall never have any occasion of uneasiness given you and as long as I live I will acknowledge when ever you desire  it that I did you wrong and that you gave me no just occasion for what has pass'd  HE spoke this with so much Affection and even with Tears in hi  Eyes that he forc'd Tears not from his Wi  e only but from her Brother too and another Relation of hers that was in the Room with them In a word the Reconciliation was made in a few Minutes for he not only comply'd with any thing his Wife or her Brother desir'd but even more than they ask'd and when they propos'd that to prevent Mistakes afterwards he would consent they should put into Writing what they desir'd and what he had said to her He call'd for a Pen and Ink and drew it out himself in the fullest Terms imaginable to the same purpose as has been related and fuller indeed than they could desire and set his Hand to it desiring the Brother and the other Relation to be Witnesses of it and then gave it to his Wife  UPON this his Wife with a glad Heart went home that very Night along with him her Brother and the other Relation being invited to go also which they did where he entertain'd them very kindly at Supper which finish'd the Reconciliation and they liv'd very comfortably together ever after  BUT now for the Reason and Occasion of all this and whence this strange Alteration proceeded To this purpose you are to understand that one Evening this Gentleman being either in his Chamber or some other Room in his House the Story is not particular in that part he sees his Cousin who had differ'd with him about his Wife come into the Room and says to him Cousin I am very sorry to hear you have continu'd to use your Wife ill and at last have turn'd her away upon my Account I come on purpose to admonish you to repent of the Injury you have done her for she is Innocent  and you know you have injur'd her as for the Wrong you do me I am out of your reach But fetch your Wife home and reconcile your self to her or I shall visit you again much less to your Satisfaction than I do now  HE gave him no time for a Reply but immediately disappear'd It may be easily guess'd what a Consternation he was left in when he found it was  n Apparition He concluded his Cousin was dead because he said he was out of his reach and he concluded that this was his Ghost or his disquieted Soul and he dreaded the threatning of his Return He endeavoured to wear it off of his Mind but it  onld not do the Impression to be sure would be  trengthned by his own Guilt and both together  rought him to himself  FOR this is to be observ'd in all such things  viz  That it is not the Fright or the Surprize that works  n the Mind but the Conviction and therefore  ho' this is one of those Relations which I do not  ake upon me to assert the fact of from my own  nowledge yet supposing it to be true the Moral  s the same and on that Account I relate it  viz  That there may be an Apparition of a Person  iving and yet the Person living and so seeming  o appear not know any thing of it or be any  ay concern'd in it and so in this Story now told  t is imply'd that the Lady here was living when  he appear'd to the Gentleman in  Germany  and that  he Gentleman in  Germany  was living when he ap  ear'd to his Cousin in  London  whatever manner they  ppear'd in and yet it seems that neither of them  new any thing of the matter and doubtless had  o concern at all in it  I HAVE not been able to dive so far into this  tory as to say that they were ever enquired of  fterward whether they were acquainted with the Circumstances or no but I am indifferent as to that  Point it is out of Question with me that they might not be any way concern'd in the thing it self and yet that it might be really an Apparition of the Persons their Faces Voices Cloaths and all the needful Apparatus fit for the Delusion  THERE are many Instances of like kind with this and I have a very particular Relation by me of a Person who in Apparition told a Friend of his of the Fire of  London  two Months before  t happen'd mention'd the manner of the Confl  gration how it would begin in the Heart of the Ci  and would burn East and West and lay the City level with the Ground to use the very words  HE happen'd not to tell the Place exactly where it was to have been done if he had he might have been afterwards brought into Trouble by the unadvised relating the Particulars for his Friend believed he really saw him and not that it was an Apparition But it seems he made a long Religious Excursion upon the dismal Condition of the Citizens and how their Pride would be brought low how their Glory would be laid in the Dust and how it was all to be look'd upon as a Blow upon them for their Luxury and for their publick Sins and so seem'd to preach pretty  much And you know if Spirits from the other World were to preach some People have such an Aversion to that dull heavy Business as they call it that they would give very little heed to it I say the Apparition seem'd to preach pretty much upon the Subject and so the Friend began to be weary of the Discour  and put him off to something else  THAT which seems Particular in this Story and which had I room here would take up some time to Discourse upon at large is that the Apparition went off in Form not discovering it self so much as to be an Apparition but came in at the Do  r was let in by a Servant in the usual manner aft  r  knocking at the Door and was carry'd into the Parlor among the Family that it discours'd of other Matters also as of the  Dutch  War and the bloody Engagement at Sea I do not remember exactly whether it said a bloody Engagement had been or would be but I think it was Engagement that had lately been  THAT there were several other Transitions in their Discourse from one Article of publick Business to another and at last to that of the Fire of  London  The Gentleman who it was discours'd to seem'd not to be much concern'd at the Prediction about the Fire looking upon it as a piece of guesswork and that his Friend spoke it as of a thing which he fear'd rather than as a thing he foretold and pretended to know of But after the Terrible Conflagration had happen'd and that the City was indeed laid low from the East to the West as had been mention'd then all the Particulars came into his Mind with some weight and some unusual reflection for the Circumstances were too evident to be slightly thought of  HOWEVER it pass'd over in the ordinary way with a little kind of wonder and it was strange that Mr  M  should be able to talk so and sure Mr  M  deals with the  Devil  and the like whereas all this while Mr  M  knew nothing of the Story and whatever Hand it was and for whatever kind purposes no notice was taken of it and Mr  M  had so little knowledge of it himself that his own House was burnt down in the general disaster and he had hardly time to save one quarter part of his Goods  IT might indeed be form'd here as an Objection against this Notion of good  pi  ts from the Insivible World and their concerni  g them  e  ves in giving Notices of appro  ching Misc  i  s  viz  That they do not concern themselves to give such Notices in  Cases of publick Calamities when many thousands not of Persons only but even of Families are concerned and in danger and even where many particular Persons who at other times have had such warnings from them and have been as it were their Particular care have been left to fall in the common disaster  THIS is what I may take notice of again in its proper place but at present I am rather observing to you what is than the Reason of its being so The ways and works of Providence are Sovereign and Superiour the Manner conceal'd and beyond our Understandings and Reason not always visible to us and yet its Proceedings not the le  just or the less to be accounted for in themselves nor is it necessary that we should be always able to account for them to our selves Heaven has its own Reasons for all its Actings and it is not for us to dispute its Sovereignty any more than to examin  into the Reason of its working The Bishop of  Dow    the Pious and Devout Doctor  Jeremy Taylor  in the Case of an Apparition yet to be spoken of would needs have the Person it appear'd to ask this Question when it came again Why he appear'd or how he come to appear in so small a matter as that of doing Justice to one single Child when so many oppress'd Widows and Orphans groan'd under the weight of greater Injuri  s without any of their Relations concerning themselves in the least for their Deliverance and the Man did accordingly ask the Question as we shall see in its place but had no answer given him as indeed I think he  ought not to have expected but of this hereafter  IT is certain the approach of that Terrible Fire the like of which was never known in this part of th  World was not discover'd from the In  isible World at least but to very few an evident token that departed Souls knew nothing of it or if they did  had no Power to come hither and give notice of it if they had what Numbers of Predictions Forebodings and Apparitions would there have been in the City for some Months before  BUT are we not answer'd by the Scripture and might we not reply in the Language of our Saviour speaking of the general Deluge  Matt  xxiv  For as in the days that were before the flood they wer  ating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that  Noe  entred into the Ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be  JUST so likewise was it at the time of the Fire of  London  'tis said indeed with some Remark that it was not a Wedding Night to many if to any one Couple in the City because the Fire beginning on the  Sunday  Morning very few if any are said to be marry'd of a  Saturday  but as it was a mighty Custom in those Days to marry on a  Sunday  so there were a great many Weddings appointed for the next Morning which were hinder'd without any forebodings or foreknowledge and that which was infinitely worse many Women in Travel that very Night were as it was reported forc'd to be carry'd out of their Chambers in the very Article of ChildBirth and some as I have heard were deliver'd in the very Passage from one House to another Others not thinking the Fire would follow so fast having remov'd but a little way their extremity being great were oblig'd to be remov'd again yet we find no notice of any of these things given in the lea  t  THIS indeed is what I s  y we cannot account for neither is there any need for us t  account for them in the Discourse we are upon for our Question is not Why there are no more Notices given than there are and why they are not universal to on  as well as another as if it were a Grace M  n  ought to have an equal Claim to But 'tis a Proposition that such Apparitions there are and that therefore there are certain Agents so appointed to appear  WE have like Accounts to these at the time of the great Massacre at  Paris  a critical Juncture in which the Rage of Hell seem'd to be carry'd to a terrible Height and when innocent Blood lay ready to be spilt in a terrible manner the Unguarded Protestants having no Means to avoid the Mischiefs that a  tended them and no Strength to resist the Power of the Cutthroat Armies which surrounded them so they had no Intimations from the invisible World to assist their Escape  BUT what does this amount to any more than the like Cases may argue in a thousand Calamities and Disasters which have befallen Mankind before Nay it confirms the grand Truth which I have insisted on namely that Souls departed know not any thing and can communicate nothing tho' unembody'd Spirit may  FOR could the departed Souls of deceas'd Relations have known that their Fathers or Children or Brothers or Relicts c were the next Day to have been murther'd can we doubt but they would have given them all the N  tice that it was in their Power to do and at least have alarm'd them so as to put them upon their Gua  d and give them an Oppo  unity to die like Hero's as many of them were and as they did not do thus I think without Injustice or Presumption we may conclude they cannot they could not then neither can others do the like now  AND yet as to such Notices as the Inhabitants of the invi  le World were allow'd to make I believe they w  not without them at that time tho' it was not thought fit by the Appointment of Heaven to have the wicked Resolution of Murther  and Massacre defeated as to the Reasons why which is what we have nothing to d  to dispute that we leave in Silence as we may well do  THE Histories of those Times are full of the secret Warnings and Notices then given by the kind Apparitions of those invisible Agents whoever they are in Dream The Admiral  Coligni  had no l  ss than three particular Notices given him by Dreams that his Life was in danger and that he would be murther'd if he stay'd in  Paris  an Express was sent him from the Count  S  at  S  umur  to make his Escape and flee for his Life before it was too late nay it was even said that the King of  Navarr  who was afterwards  Hen  IV sent a private Message to him to be gone and if he staid one Night longer he would find it impossible But as they said afterwards his Hour was come and his Fate was det  rmin'd and he was de  f to his Friends for several others who h  d a J  alousy of his Danger gave him like War  i  gs but it was all in vain he was deaf and indolent to his own Safety  SOME others who were more obedient to the heavenly Vision more toucht then with the Sense of their Danger as the Count  de Montgomery  the  Vidame  of  Chartres de Caversac  and others too many to name and who had severally and some of them jointly timely Warning of their Danger mounted their Horses and fled the very Night b  fore and preventing the vigilance of their Pursu  rs m  de their Escap    I MIGHT here enlarge upon the Probability of this as a Maxim that tho' these Spirits may have leave to give such Notice and such Warnings to s  me particular Persons for the saving their Lives yet we are not to suppose 'tis plac'd in their Power to contravene the Determination of H  aven and  to act contrary to Appointments of his Providence especially in things of general Import such as publick Judgments which are immediately in the disposing of his Power and not to be disappointed or delay'd  BESIDES as w  may have Reason to believe that they all act by Commission 'tis also most certain that they cannot go an lnch no not a Hair's br  adth beyond that Commission or step one Foot out of the Way of it to the right Hand or to the left and thence we are to infer that they do not give farther or more frequent Notices to us because they are not p  rmitted and this is besides the rest adding a greater Reverence to the thing itself for take off their superior Commission and I know not what we should say to them or of what real Notice or Value they would be  I CANNOT but say that there were many Notices given of the Calamity of the  Parisian  Massacre which were enough to have allarm'd the Protestants and the Chiefs of them were in some Measure allarm'd tho' not sufficient as it prov'd to drive them out of the Danger yet so as that they did p  rceive some Mischief was hatching but they could not possibly guess at the manner and besides if they had the other Par  y had gotten them so far in their Power that they could not avoid the Danger but were taken as it were in a Toil and yet they did s  d s  ch Notices of their Danger to their Friends in s  v  ral Places as to warn them in time to be up  n their Guard and which Warning did speaking  f second Causes preserve them from the like Mischief for the Massacre was intended to be Universal at least in  ll the Citi  s in  France  CHAP XII Of Apparitions being said to happen just at the time when the Person so happening to appear is said to be departing the Fiction of it confuted  THERE is a great Clamour as I might justly call it rais'd about Peoples appearing just at the time of their expiring and so exactly t  ey will tell us it as to time as if tho' a thousand Mile off the Soul was in Apparition the same Moment I see no foundation for any of these Relations much less for the Circumstances and yet the Apparition it self may be really true in Fact such a Man appear'd to his Wife such another to his Son and the like and they set down the time adding and that very Moment as near as could be calculated he died perhaps in the  EastIndies  or at Sea at some vast distance  A CERTAIN Lady of my Acquaintance going out of her Chamber into a Closet in the adjoining Room saw her Husband walking along in the Room before her She immediately comes down in a great surprize tells the Family she had seen her Husband and she was sure it was he tho' at the same time she knew her Husband who was the Commander of a Ship was at Sea on a Voyage to or from the Capes of  Virginia  THE Family takes the Alarm and tells her that to be sure her Husband was dead and that she should be sure to set down the Day of the Month and the Hour of the Da  and it was ten thousand  to one but she should find that he died that very Moment or as near as could be found out  ABOUT two Months after her Husband comes home very well but had an Accident befell him in his Voyage  viz  that stepping into the Boat or out of the Boat he fell into the Sea and was in danger of being lost and this they Calculated upon to be as near the time as they could judge that he appear'd to his Wife Now if this was his Ghost or Apparition of his Soul in the Article of Death it seems his Soul was mistaken and did not know whether it was dismiss'd or no which is a little strange I must confess but of that hereafter  Sir  Jo    O  was a P  rs  n of Note and of well known Credit his Lady and one of her Sons liv'd here in  London  and being of a gay Disposition and given to live h  gh and exp  nsive it was thought she spent beyond what the Knight could afford and that he was sensible of it and uneasie at it She had a very good House in  London  and a Country House or Lodgings for the Summer atand kept a great Equipage the Consequence of things did at last prove that Sir  J  's dislike of it was justly founded but that's by the by  IT happen'd one Day the L  y being at her Country Lodgings a Pe  son well dress  d appearing very much like a Gentleman came to her City House and knocking at the D  r ask'd the Maid if there were any Lodgings to be let there and if her Lady was at home the Maid answer'd No there were no Lodgings to Le  t there and speaking as if it was with some  sen  ment  Lodgings  says she no  I think not  my Lady  does not use to Lett Lodgings  Well but  Sweet  eart says he  don't be displeas'd your Lady h  s ha  some thoughts of  aying at her Summer Lodgings all the Winter  and so would dispose of some Apartments here for the Parliament Season and I am directed by her self to look upon the Rooms and give my Answer let me but just see them Child I shall do you no harm so he step'd in and as it were push'd by her going into the first Parlour and sat down in an easy Chair his Servant staying at the Door and as the Maid did not apprehend any Mischief she went in after him for he did not look like one that came with an ill Design or to rob the House but look'd like a Gentleman that could have nothing of such a kind in his View so I say she went in after him  WHEN she came in he rose up and looking about the Room he found fault with every thing the Furniture and the manner of it nothing pleas'd him not as if not good enough for him but that all was too good and too rich far above her Quality that own'd it That the Lady did not know what she did that it was an Expence she could not carry on and her Estate would not support it but that such a way of living would bring all the Family to Rui  and Beggary  and the like  BY and by she carried him into another Parlour and there he did just the same he told her he admir'd what her Lady meant that she liv'd in a Figure which Sir  John  's Estate could never maintain and she would but ruin him and bring him into Debt and so he would be undone by her Extravagance  UPON this the Maid begun to take him short a little and told him this was all out of the way of what he came about if the Lodgings were too good for him that was his Business indeed but else he had nothing to do with her Lady and how she pleas'd to furnish her House That her Master was a Gentleman of a great Estate and had large Plantations  in  Jamaica  that he constantly supply'd her Lady with Money sufficient  or her Support and for all her Expences and she wonder'd he should trouble h  mself with that which she was sure was none of his Business in short the Girl huffed him and ask'd him what it was to him who was a Stranger how her Lady liv'd  HOWEVER he turns to the Maid and sitting down again calmly enter'd into some Discourse with her about her Lady and her way of Living and told so many of the Secrets of the Family to her that she began to use him better and to perceive that he knew more of the  amily than she thought he had or indeed than she did her self at last the Wench began to be un  si  and to question in her Thought whether it was not her Master himself come over  Incognito  and only that he had not yet discover'd himself  SHE tried several times to learn who he was his Quality his Country his Name and how she might send to him but he put it off only told her he would go towhere her Lady lodg'd and wait upon her Lady himself and so treating the Servant very civily and thanking her for showing him the House he went away in Form with his Servant following him so that he did not vanish as an Apparition at all  YET the poor Wench was very uneasie she began to think it could not be an ordinary Creature because he gave such strange and particular Accounts of things done in the Family as where several things were deposited that belong'd to the Family with several Circumstances belonging to her Mistress to her little Son and to his Father in the  WestIndies  and in short said some things which as she said none but the  Devil  could tell of which by the way was talking as ignorant People talk of such things  namely that if any thing be said or done out o  the ordinary Way and more than is common for Men to talk or do they immediately say it must be the  Devil  IT must be confess'd it shews a Difference between the Present and the Past Ages In former Times if a Man did extraordinary Things he was look'd upon as inspir'd from Heaven or if great miraculous Things were wrought it was said immediately to be from Heaven  Come see a Man that h  s told me all that ever I did  says the Woman of  Samaria  John iv and it follows  is not this the Christ  she did not say presently this must be the  Devil Never Man spake like this Man  say the Messengers sent to apprehend Jesus Christ and away they came without him strook with awful Apprehensions  John  vii not concluding presently that it was the  Devil No Man could do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him  John iii he does not say no Man could do such Miracles as these but it must be the  Devil  On the contrary his Conclusion is  We know  by these Mirac  es  that thou art a Teacher sent from God  But now if any thing be done extraordinary or said surprizingly it must be the  Devil  as if God had ceas'd to work and all Extraordinaries were committed to the  Devil  THUS the  Pertuis Rostan  which is a wonderful Passage cut through a Mountain near  Briançon  on the Frontiers of  Dauphine  call'd one of the five Wonders of  Dauphine  is said to be the Work of the  Devil  only because the People have no History recording the Time or Manner of its making or by who and because they think it past the Power of Men's Hands and the like of many Places and Things in  England  But this is a Digression  THE Poor Wench I am speaking of was surpriz'd ve  y much at this Gentleman and more after  he was gone than before for he did not give her time before to reflect upon the Particulars he mention'd to her but following one thing with another he found her enough to do to take in the heads of Things in the gross  BUT when he was gone and she came to reflect and lay things together she began to consider Who must this be How could he know such and such things How could he tell whose Picture that was Where my Mistress had such a Suit of Curtains and such a Cabin  t Who must he be to tell me how long my Master has been at  Jamaica  how much his Estate is there and how much Money he has sent my Lady o  r i  so and so long time This must be the  Devil  in my Master's Cloaths something must be in it I'll go to my Lady and let her know it all and wi  h this the Maid gets a Woman that used to be trusted in such Cases to look after the House and away she goes toto her Mistress without so much as staying to dress her  INDEED I think 'tis a part of the Story that the Gentleman desir'd she would acquaint her Mistress with it that such a Person had been there and gave her some particular Tokens by which he said her Mistress would understand who he was and that she should tell her what he said that her Income would not support the Expences she liv'd at but that it would bring her to Ruin and she would be undone but this Part I do not positively remember but that he told the Maid it would be so that I am particular in  HOWEVER the poor Girl the more she ruminated upon the thing the more she was frighted and di  order'd about it and away she went as I have said  o give her Lady an Account of it and she was the more eager to go also because she under  tood him that he int  nded to wait upon her himself  to talk about the Lodgings and so she would prepare her Lady to receive him and to consider what kind of a Man it must be that she might not be frighted at him But he had been too quick for the Maid  WHEN she came toshe found her Mistress thrown down upon the Bed very ill and so ill that at first they told her she could not speak with her Don't tell me  says Mary  that is the  L  ndon  Maid I must speak with her and will speak with her for I have extraordinary Business with her What extraordinary Business can you have says the Lady's Woman taunting at her if your Business was from the  Devil  you can't speak with my Lady just now for she is very ill and laid down upon the Bed  FROM the  Devil says Mary  I don't know but it may and I believe it is indeed and I must speak with my Lady immediately  NAY  says the Woman  here has been one Messenger too many from the  Devil  already I think sure you don't come of his Errand too do ye  I DON'T know whose Errand I come of but I am frighted out of my Wits let me speak with my Lady presently or I shall die before I deliver my Message  DIE  says the Woman  I wish my Lady don't die before she can  ear it pr'ythee  Mary  if it be any thing to fright her don't t  ll it her just now for she is almost frighted to Death already  WHY  says Mary  has my Lady seen any thing  AY ay Seen  says th  Woman  she has seen and heard too here has b  n a Man here has brought her some dreadful Tidings I don't know what it is  THEY talk'd this so loud or were so near that the Lady heard something of it and immediately she rung a Bell for h  r Woman  WHEN the Woman went in Who is that below  says she  talking so earnestly is any body come in from  London  YES Madam  says her Woman  here is  Mary  come to speak with your Ladyship  MARY  come  says she  with a Surprize what's the Matter what has she seen any thing too mercy on me what's the Matter what does she say  SHE does not say much Madam  says the Woman  but she wants mightily to speak with your Ladyship and is in a great Hurry  WHAT  says the Lady  is she frighted  I BELIEVE she is  says the Woman  but she won't tell any thing but to your self  O I shall die  says the Lady  call her up  PRAY Madam  says her Woman  don't call her up 'till you  Ladyship has recover'd your self a little from your other Disorders she'll tell you some wild Tale or other of her own Imagination that will raise the Vapours and do you a Mischief  O  says the Lady  let me hear it let it be what it will if it be from the  Devil  it can't be worse than it is call her up I must speak with her  ACCORDINGLY  Mary  came up and the Woman was order'd to withdraw  AS soon as the Door was shut her Lady burst out into Tears again for she had been crying vehemently before O  Mary says she  I have had a dreadful Visit this Afternoon here has been your Master  MY Master Why Madam that's impossible  NAY it has been your Master to be sure or the  Devil  in his Likeness  IN a word 'tis certain it was her Hu  band in Apparition or an Apparition of her Husband and he talk'd very warmly and closely to her and told her his Estate would not support her expensive way of Living and that she would bring her self  to Misery and Poverty and a great deal more to the same Purpose as he had said to  Mary  MARY  immediately ask'd her Ladyship what manner he appear'd in and by the Description that her Mistress gave it was exactly the same Figure that came to her and desired to see the Lodgings so  Mary  gave her Lady a particular Relation of what happen'd to her also and of the Message she was charg'd to deliver  WHAT follow'd upon this Alarm and how the Lady was reduced and obliged to sell her fine Furniture and Equipage and came to very low Circumstances tho' it was a part of the Story is not so much to my Purpose in the Relation But what is remarkable to the Case in hand is that they alledge that just at this Juncture Sir  J    O    ne  the Lady's Husband died in the  WestIndies  I suppose by his Death her Supplies were immediately stopped and that was the Occasion of her being reduced so suddenly  NOW the Apparition and its appearing in the Shape or Figure of the Husband his warning her of her approaching Circumstances and moving her to abate her expensive way of Living and the like all this is agreeable to the Opinion I have already given that good Spirits may be allowed to assume humane Shape and the Shape of any particular Person whether the Person be dead or living and may appear to us to caution us in our wrong Measures to warn us against impending Mischiefs and to direct us in Difficulties And how merciful is it to Mankind that there are such kind Monitors at hand at any time for our good  BUT that this must be just in the Article of Death just when the Person was dying and the Soul departing as if the Soul could stay in its Passage between Life and the eternal State to call at this or that Place and deliver a Message  For Example if it was to be carry'd by the Angels into  Abrabam  's Bosom you must suppose those Angels would go about with it from  Jamaica  to  London  to give it leave to speak with his Wife before its Translation before those swift Messengers perform'd their Task nay that he must stop at the  London  House assume a Shape for that Purpose talk about the most frivolous things with  Mary  the Servant Maid and then go with another formal Errand toto his Wife all this in his Journey and having dispatch'd these more weighty Affairs then go on for Heaven afterwards  THIS I say has to me no Consistency in it no Coherence it does not hang together in my Opinion at all nor can I make any common Sense of it no not if I was to come to the old poetick Fictions of  Charon  and his FerryBoat even the old FerryMan would not have stept out of his Way upon any such Business  WHAT might be done by the Agency of those Spirits appointed by the Great Lord of all Spirit to attend for the good of his Creatures I have not the least Objection against but that the Soul of the Deceased or Departed can come of this Errand it self that I deny and must insist upon it that there is neither Reason or Religion in it 'tis founded wholly in the Imagination and tho' the Imagination may not in this Case form the Apparition yet 'tis evident the Imagina  ion only appropriates it to the Person that is to the Soul of the Person who has really  o Share in the Operation  UPON this Foundation likewise stands the old Heathen Notion taken from the C  e of  Achilles  and his Friend  Patr  lus  that the Soul of the Deceased cannot be at Rest 'till he h  s come and given Notice of such and such things that Justice be done to such and such injur'd Persons and Money so and so appropriated be regularly disposed and the  Will of the Deceased punctually performed These I take not to be imaginary but fictitious and made or supplyed out of the Invention of the Relator in order to dish up the Story  AND this makes the Story of the Duke of  Buckingham  's Father of which mention has been made already be liable to so many Exceptions That his Father could not rest or his Soul could not be at rest because of the wicked Life his Son  George  liv'd at Court That part must certainly be added by some of the very very many Relators or who have call'd themselves Relators of that Story and my Lord  Clarendon  who seems to have been the most exact and judicious in the putting the whole Story together has none of that Passage in his Account of it as we shall see presently  UPON what Religious Foundation can we suggest that the Sins of the Children should disquiet the Fathers in their Graves or that the Souls departed can receive any Impression from the Behaviour of those in Life subsequent to any Action those Souls departed have been concern'd in  THAT they may be affected in a Future State with the Wickedness and Offences committed in their past Life that I will not doubt tho' even not that in such a manner as to send them back hither upon any Errand about it for all is irretrievable as there is no Repentance so no Reparation there is neither  Work nor Invention in the Grave  whither we are all going The Soul may be in a State of SelfReflection and Reproach but not in a State of Reaction no recovering for our selves nor concern for others 'tis all out of the Question and all the Notices from the other side of the Curtain come from other Hands whose Name soever they may speak in or whose Shape soever they may assume  I AM forc'd how reluctant soever to talk Scripture to my Readers upon this nice part of the Subject whether they will lay any weight upon it or no be that to themselves  IN INSIST upon it that the Souls of the dead can make no Visits hither when once they are removed that when they are unembodied disrob'd of Flesh and Blood they have no more concern with or about us so as either to disturb their Rest or ours and this is plain to me not only from the Nature of the thing from Reason and Observation but from the Scripture  Eccl  ix  For the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more a Reward for the memory of them is fotgotten  This latter part relates to their having any Reward or Concern in things here of this Life no more Reward or Benefit or Share of things here But look into the next words ver  Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun  WHAT can be plainer than this if Scripture be of any moment among us if not I can say nothing to that But I say what can be plainer and what do those People mean who tell us a Ghost or Spirit appear'd and said it could not be at Rest 'till it had come to do so and so 'till it had discover'd such and such things and 'till it had seen it well perform'd  IF my Vote in this Case may be of any Value or I may offer any thing by way of Direction to weaker Heads let them make this one thing a Character or Mark to know such things by or to judge of them  viz  That when they meet with any Story told in such a manner they should conclude it a fiction a cheat that it is only a Story made by the Invention of StoryMakers a Delusion  and that no Spirit or Apparition really coming upon any Message from the Invisible World ever talks after that manner or that if they do 'tis a Cheat of the  Devil  to carry on some Delusion and to make some Lye appear plausible for that there can be no reality in it that's asserted as above  The dead know not any thing  not any thing  HERE  but their  Love  and their  Hatred  and their  Envy is perished  WE have another Story to offer in this case which has been mention'd as if it were the Act and Deed of the Person departed and in whose Name it was said to be done and who as we may say was personated in it I shall relate the Story impartially as I receiv'd it and let all the Advantage that can be taken of it be made I believe it will not amount to any rational Conclusion in Favour of this Notion that the Soul of the Person deceased is any way concern'd in it or in any part of it  THIS is the famous Story of the Apparition of one  James Haddock  in  Ireland  which is pu  lish'd many several ways and that by several Authors and some of them intimating that it was really the departed Soul of  James Haddock  who could not be at Res  as some of the Writers of the Story would insinuate because his little Son by his Wife  Eleanor Welch  was wrong'd in a Lease le  t by him to the Child but kept from him by her second Husband  THE abridg'd Story is this In the Year an Apparition meets one  Francis Taverner  on the Highway the Man having Courage to speak to it asks it what he is and the Apparition tells him he is  James Haddock  and gives him several Tokens to remember him by which  Taverner  also calling to mind owns them and then boldly demands of the Apparition what business he had with him  the Apparition did not tell his Business that Night but would have had  Taverner  rode back his way with him and he would tell him his Business which  Taverner  refus'd as well he might and that part indeed seems the only improbable part of the Story  HOWEVER the next Night the Apparition comes to him again and then tells him the Business which was to desire him to go to his Wife whose Maiden Name was  Eleanor Welsh  but was then marry'd again to one  Davis  which  Davis  withheld the Lease from the Orphan  Haddock  's Son and tell her she should cause Justice to be done to the Child  TAVERNER  neglected to perform this Errand and was so continually follow'd by the Apparition that it was exceeding terrible to him and at last it threaten'd to tear him in Peices if he did not go of his Errand  UPON this he goes and delivers the Message to the Woman who it seems took but small Notice of it and then the Apparition came again and told him he must go to his Executor and do the same Errand which he was it seems afraid to do for fear of  Davis  but the Apparition threaten'd  Davis  if he should attempt to do him  Taverner  any Injury  N B  Here I am to Note that this Story made so much Noise in the Country and the Particulars appear'd to be so faithfully related by  Taverner  that abundance of Persons of Note came to him to have the Relation from his own Mouth and among the rest the Lord Bishop of  Down  and  Connor  who I name in Reverence not to his Dignity only or so much as in Reverence of his known Piety and Seriousness in Religion Being the fam'd Doctor  Jeremy Taylor  Author of a known Book call'd  Rules of Holy Living and Dying  THIS Reverend Father sent for the said  Francis Taverner  to examine him about  this strange scene of Providence  so the Bishop call'd it and he did examine him strictly about it and the Account says his Lordship was fully satisfied that the Apparition was true and real that is to say that it was true that there was really such an Apparition  NOW all this is within the Bounds of what I have laid down  viz  That there are really Apparitions and these Apparitions do personate such and such Bodies or Shapes whose Names they take upon them and whose Persons they represent  BUT for the rest I think all the Notions that the People then entertain'd of it and even the Bishop among the rest must be very erroneous and mistaken For  THE Bishop entertain'd the Story as if this Apparition was really the Soul of the departed  James Haddock  as appear'd by a second Examination of  Taverner  by his Lordship for the Lady  Conway  and other Persons of Quality hearing the Bishop had sent for  Taverner  to examine him went all away to be present at the Examination And the Bishop being gone to a Town call'd  Hillsbro'  three Miles off the Company went all thither and  Taverner  was sent for to them and there examin'd of all the Particulars again and answer'd again to the Satisfaction of all the Company  BUT here and for this reason I relate this part his Lordship after asking many more Questions concluded by advising  Taverner  to ask the Apparition when it came again Whence are you are you a good or an evil Spirit by which is suppos'd his Lordship understood Are you in a good or bad State for his next Question was Where is your Abode what Station do you hold how are you regimented in the other World and what is the Reason that you appear for the Relief of your Son  in so small a Matter when so many Widows and Orphans are oppress'd in the World being defrauded of greater Matters and none from thence of their Relations appear to right them  AND the very same Night  Taverner  meeting the Apparition again who it seems was fully satisfy'd with what he had done in delivering the Message to the Executor at this Appearing  Taverner  ask'd him the Questions above but it gave him no Answer and indeed it could not be expected that Curiosity should be answered  FOR as I said above it is evident by the Questions the Bishop in all these Examinations fell in with the vulgar Error of the Time about such Apparitions namely that it was the Soul of  James Haddock  and well indeed might he ask how he came to Appear when others in Cases of greater Moment did not  BUT he should have ask'd How is it possible you that are dead should be acquainted with these Circumstances when the Word of God says expresly the Dead know not any thing and that all their Love and Hatred is perished Had he ask'd him that perhaps he might have told him that he was not the Soul of  James Haddock  but a good Spirit sent from the invisible World by the especial direction of Heaven to right a poor ruin'd oppress'd Orphan abandon'd to Injury by its own unnatural Mother But to talk of the Soul of  James Haddock  and what Station it held in the other World the Apparition might well go away and give no Answer to it  NOR in any of this Discourse did the Apparition pretend it was not at Rest or could not be at Rest 'till Justice was done to the Child or 'till the Message was deliver'd the Apparition was too just to itself to say so and on the other Hand 'tis to me one of the most convincing Proofs that  it was really an Apparition or Appearance of a Spirit  NOW as in other Cases what Spirit it was may be worth taking Notice of here is not the least room to suggest that it was the  Devil  or an evil Spirit and therefore the Bishop was wrong in that too to ask if it was a good or evil Spirit for how should his Wisdom judge who was himself a good Man that an evil Spirit should come of a good Errand to right an injur'd Orphan an oppress'd Fatherless Child the  Devil  or any evil Spirit could hardly be suppos'd to move about such Business  IT is to be observ'd here and should have been added to the Story that the said  Davis  and his Wife tho' it seems much against his Will did give up the Lease to the Child the Son of that  James Haddock  with this dismal Circumstance attending it  viz  That about five Years after and when the Bishop was dead one  Costlet  who was the Child's Trustee threatned to take away the Lease again rail'd at  Taverner  and made terrible Imprecations upon himself if he knew of the Lease and threatned to go to Law with the Orphan But one Night being drunk at the Town of  HillHall  near  Lisburne  in  Ireland  where all this Scene was laid going home he fell from his Horse and never spoke more and so the Child enjoy'd the Estate peaceably ever after  IN a Word the little injur'd Orphan seem'd to be the Care of Heaven in a particular manner and the good Angel which appear'd in its behalf without doubt executed God's Justice upon the wicked drunken Oppressor the Trustee and as he imprecated Vengeance on himself  o th  t same Spirit might be Commission'd to see it fall upon him  AND here it most naturally occurs to observe that the departed Souls of Men and Women dead and buried cannot be suppos'd to have any Commission to execute particular Vengeance on any in this World the Supposition of this would bring a confus'd medly of Notions upon us such as would be inconsistent not with Religion only but even with common Sense and which need not take up any of our Pains to confute them  NOTHING has more fill'd the idle Heads of the old Women of these latter Ages than the Stories of Ghosts and Apparitions coming to People to tell them where Money was hidden and how to find it and 'tis wonderful to me that such Tales should make such Impressions and that sometimes among wise and judicious People too as we find they have done How many old Houses have been almost pull'd down and Pitts fruitlesly dug in the Earth at the ridiculous Motion of pretended Apparitions of which I shall speak more in its Place  I HAVE hitherto studiously avoided giving you any Accounts however extraordinary that have been already made publick but this one which relates to the Assassination of the great Duke of  Buckingham  whether famous or infamous I know not which to determine him in the time of the late King  Charles  I I cannot omit because the various manner of its being related so eminently touches the Case in Hand  THAT the Duke of  Buckingham  was slabb'd by one Lieutenant  Felton  at  Portsmouth  as he was going upon an Expedition for the Relief of  Rochelle  History is so full of it and all that know any thing of our  English  Annals are so well acquainted with the Story of it that I need say nothing to introduce that Part Mr  Aubrey  takes upon him to relate the Story of an Apparition upon this Occasion in the following manner  To one Mr  Towes  who had been Schoolfellow with Sir  George Villers  the Father of the first Duke of  Buckingham  and was his Friend and Neighbour as he lay in his Bed awake and it was Daylight came into his Chamber the Phantome of his dear Friend Sir  George Villers  Said Mr  Towes  to him Why you are dead what makes you here Said the Knight I am dead but cannot rest in Peace for the Wickedness and Abomination of my Son  George  at Court I do appear to you to tell him of it and to advise and dehort him from his evil ways Said Mr  Towes  The Duke will not believe me but will say that I am mad or doat Said Sir  George  Go to him from me and tell him by such a Token a Mole that he had in some secret Place which none but himself knew of Accordingly Mr  Towes  went to the Duke who  laugh'd at his Message  At his return home the Phantome appeared again and told that the Duke would be stabb'd he drew out a Dagger a quarter of a Year after which accordingly happened  THIS Part of the Story indeed is calculated like a true Chimneycorner Piece of News that Sir  George  who was dead should say he could not rest in Peace for the Wickedness and Abomination of his Son  George  at Court  PREPOSTEROUS What State must old Sir  George  be in If in a State of Misery what does he mean by  resting in Peace  if in a State of Blessedness what could his Son do to impeach his Rest and if we shall give any weight to what the Scripture says in that Case he knew nothing of him let his own State or his Son's  Abominations  as he calls them be what they would See  Job  xiv  The waters wear the Stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man Thou pr  vailest for ever against  him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sondest him away His sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them  'TIS plain here that the Hope that is the Knowledge and Wisdom of Man as to this World is destroyed and wash'd away in Death his Sons may rise or fall be great or little high or low good or evil 'tis all one to him he knows nothing of it How then could Sir  George Villers  say several Years after he was dead too that he could not rest in Peace What had he been at Rest and in Peace and was he disquieted again by his Son  George  's Wickedness that does not hang together at all The old Knight had been dead several Years before his Son  George  came to rise at Court when he did rise he was not immediately so abominably wicked as he was afterward Where then was the Soul of Sir  George  the Father all the while his Rest could not be disturb'd 'till the Circumstances that disturb'd it happen'd  BUT my Lord  Clarendon  tells this same Story with much more Probability of Truth for first he leaves out the Absurdity which indeed his Lordship was too wise a Man to impose upon the World with the Sanction of his Authority nor was there Sense enough in it to give it Credit  IN the next Place he does not make the Person to whom Sir  George Villers  appear'd be an Equal and an Int  mate Friend but one that had liv'd in the same Town where Sir  George  had liv'd and had not seen him for many Years but recollected him from the Cloaths he had seen him wear whereas the Story above makes them dear Friends which if it had been so it was not likely he should refuse to hear the Message and yet he scruples it very much  BUT there are more discording Circumstances in the Story Let us take the Lord  Clarendon  's Relation which is done with an appparent Regard to Truth and is as follows  The Account of the Apparition of Sir  George Villers  relating to the Murther of the Duke of  Buckingham  his Son as taken from the Lord  Clarendon  's History  Vol I Fo  as follows  THRRE were many Stori  s scatter'd abroad at that time of several Prophecies and Predictions of the Duke's untimely and violent Death amongst the rest there was one which was upon a better Foundation of Credit than usually such Discourses are founded upon  THERE was an Officer in the King's Wardrobe in  WindsorCastle  of a good Reputation for Honesty and Discretion and then about the Age of fifty Years or more  THIS Man had in his Youth been bred in a School in the Parish where Sir  George Villers  the Father of the Duke liv'd and had been much cherish'd and obliged in that Season of his Age by the said Sir  George  whom afterwards he never saw  ABOUT six Months before the miserable End of the Duke of  Buckingham  about Midnight this Man being in his Bed at  Windsor  where his Office was and in very good Health there appeared to him on the side of his Bed a Man of a very venerable Aspect who drew the Curtains of his Bed and fixing his Eyes upon him ask'd him if he knew him  THE poor Man half dead with Fear and Apprehension being ask'd the second  ime whether  he remembred him and having in that time called to his Memory the Presence of Sir  George Villers  and the very Cloaths he used to wear in which at that time he seem'd to be habited he answer'd him That he thought him to be that Person he reply'd He was in the right that he was the same and that he expected a Service from him which was That he should go from him to his Son the Duke of  Buckingham  and tell him if he did not somewhat to ingratiate himself to the People or at least to abate the extreme Malice which they had against him he would be suffer'd to live but a short time  AFTER this Discourse he disappear'd and the poor Man if he had been at all waking slept very well 'till Morning when he believed all this to be a Dream and consider'd it no otherwise  THE next Night or shortly after the same Person appear'd to him again  in the same Place and about the same time of the Night with an Aspect a little more severe than before and asked him Whether he had done as he had required of him and perceiving he had not gave him very severe Reprehensions told him he expected more Compliance from him and that if he did not perform his Commands he should enjoy no Peace of Mind but should always be pursu'd by him Upon which he promised him to obey But the next Morning waking out of a good Sleep tho' he was exceedingly perplex'd with the lively Representation of all Particulars to his Memory he was willing still to persuade himself that he had only dream'd and consider'd that he was a Person at such a distance from the Duke that he knew not how to find out any Admission to his Presence much less  had any Hope to be believed in what he should say so with great Trouble and Unquietness he spent some time in thinking what he should do and in the end resolved to do nothing in the matter  THE same Person appeared to him the third Time with a terrible Countenance and bitterly reproaching him for not performing what he had promised to do The poor Man had by this time recover'd the Courage to tell him that in Truth he had deserred the Execution of his Commands upon considering how difficult a thing it would be for him to get any Access to the Duke having Acquaintance with no Person about him and if he should obtain Admission to him he should never be able to persuade him that he was sent in such a manner that he should at least be thought to be mad or to be set on and employ'd by his own or the Malice of other Men to abuse the Duke and so he should be  sure to be undone  THE Person reply'd as  he had done before that he should never find Rest 'till he should per  orm what he required and therefore he were better to dispatch it that the Access to his Son was known to be very easie and that few Men waited long for him and for the gaining him Credit he would tell him two or three Particulars which he charged him never to mention to any Person living but to the Duke himself and he should no sooner hear them but he should believe all the rest he should say and so repeating his Threats he left him  IN the Morning the poor Man more confirm'd by the last Appearance made his Journey to  London  where the Court then was he was very well known to Sir  Ralph Freeman  one of the Masters of Requests who had married a Lady  that was nearly ally'd to the Duke and was himself well received by him To him this Man went and tho' he did not acquaint him with all the Particulars he said enough to let him know there was something extraordinary in it and the Knowledge he had of the Sobriety and Discretion of the Man made the more Impression on him He desired that by his means he might be brought to the Duke in such a Place and in such a Manner as should be thought fit affirming that he had much to say to him and of such a Nature as would require much Privacy and some Time and Patience in the hearing  SIR  Ralph  promis'd he would speak first with the Duke of him and then he should understand his Pleasure and accordingly the first Opportunity he did inform him of the Reputation and Honesty of the Man and then what he desired and of all he knew of the matter  THE Duke according to his usual Opennes  and Condescension told him that he was the next Day early to hunt with the King that his Horses should attend him at  Lambeth  Bridge where he should land by five of the Clock in the Morning and if the Man attended him there at that Hour he would walk and speak with him as long as should be necessary  SIR  Ralph  carried the Man with him the next Morning and presented him to the Duke at his Landing who receiv'd him courteously  d walk'd aside in Conference near an Hour  one but his own Servants being at that Hour in that Place and they and Sir  Ralph  at such a Distance that they could not hear a Word tho' the Duke sometimes spoke loud and with great Commotion which Sir  Ralph  the more easily observ'd and perceived because he kept his Eyes always fix'd upon the Duke having procur'd the  Conference upon somewhat he knew there was of extraordinary  The Man told him in his Return over the Water that when he mention'd those Particulars which were to gain him Credit the Substance whereof he said he durst not impart unto him the Duke's Colour chang'd and he  swore  he could come at that Knowledge only by the  Devil  for that those Particulars were only known to himself and to one Person more who he was sure would never speak of it  THE Duke pursu'd his Purpose of Hunting but was observed to ride all the Morning with great Pensiveness and in deep Thoughts without any Delight in the Exercise he was upon and before the Morning was spent left the Field and alighted at his Mother's Lodgings in  Whit  hall  with whom he was shut up for the Space of two or three Hours the Noise of their Discourse freq  ently reaching the Ears of those who attended in the next Rooms And when the Duke left her his Countenance appear'd full of Trouble with a Mixture of Anger a Countenance that was never before observed in him in any Conversation with her towards whom he had a profound Reverence and the  Countess  her self for though she was marri  d to a private Gentleman Sir  Thomas Compton  she had been created  Countess  of  Buckingham  shortly after her Son had first assumed that Title was at the Duke's leaving her found overwhelm'd in Tears and in the highest Agony imaginable  WHATEVER there was of all this it is notorious Truth that when the News of the Duke's Murther which happen'd within a few Months after was brought to his Mother she seem'd not in the least degree surprized but received it as if she had foreseen it nor did afterwards  express such a degree of Sorrow as was expected from such a Mother for the Loss of such a Son  BESIDES the abovenamed clashing Circumstances in the differing Relation of this Story there are one or two that are very material as will appear by the following Remarks    AUBREY  says Mr  Towes  as he calls him went to the Duke and told him the Token notwithstanding which the Duke laugh'd at his Message whereas my Lord  Clarendon  tells just the contrary that the Duke gave him an open tho' a very particular Audience all his Attendance keeping at a distance and that he held him in that earnest Discourse for an Hour    AUBREY  says the Token Sir  George  gave to enforce or engage his Son's Attention was that he the Duke had a Mole in such a private Part of his Body but my Lord says the Token given was of such a Nature as the Duke swore none but the  Devil  and one Person in the World could know and that he was sure that one Person would not speak of it and that the Duke was extremely disturbed when he heard of it  N B  FAME tho' with some Privacy says that the secret Token was an incestuous Breach of Modesty between the Duke and a certain Lady too nearly related to him which it surprized the Duke to hear of and that as he thought he had good Reason to be sure the Lady would not tell it of her self so he thought none but the Devil could tell it besides her and this astonished him so that he was very far from receiving the Man slightly or laughing at his Message  WHAT this Apparition then was and from whom or from whence remains to be decided That the thing was real is too well attested it comes  loaded with so many concurring Circumstances and told in the hearing of so many Witnesses of good Fame and Credit that there is no Room to question the Fact and as to the various Ways of relating it the Truth of the whole is not abated by it at all only as is natural to things of this Nature which pass thro' so many Hands every one expressing themselves their own way tho' meaning the same thing they often vary at last in the very Substance by only varying at first in the Ci  cumstances  THE Truth of the Matter is at last that the Apparition foretold his Ruin and it soon follow'd Now that this Apparition could not be the  Devil  is evident from the Reasons laid down before in the like Cases How can we suppose the  Devil  would be offended with the wicked Life and abominable Practices of the Duke of  Buckingham  at Court His incestuous Lewdness and whatever other scandalous Practices he allowed himself in the  Devil  might perhaps encourage and prompt him to but he would never s  nd a Messenger to him to warn him against them and to alarm him with Apprehensions of Danger attending him if he did not reform This is none of the  Devil  's Business 'tis quite foreign to him 'twould be the weakest thing in the World to suggest it of him  AGAIN if it were any thing immediately from Heaven it would have been effectual to have awaken'd and reform'd him But as it might be a kind Messenger from another part of the invisible World where his approaching Fate was known and who having given him this Notice left his Reformation in his own Power and laid the Necessity of it before the Eyes of his Reason as well as of his Conscience and that after this his Fall was of himself this makes it all rational and easie to be understood and is agreeable to the ordinary Custom of Providence  in like Cases of which many Examples might be given in the World  NOR is it strange that the Apparition should personate the old deceased Father of the Duke and assume his Shape to add as it were a Solemnity to the Message and give it a greater Influence upon the Mind of the Duke and the same Messenger might have assumed any other Shape or Person if it had thought fit whether living or dead  BUT if the Shape assumed was the most likely to give Weight to the Errand it was to be sent about we are not to wonder at all that a Spirit employ'd or employing it self on an Errand of such Importance should be able to single out such Appearances or such Shapes and Persons to appear in the Figure of as were aptest to enforce the Message The wellchusing the Person is to me a Testimony for not against the Goodness the Judgment and Capacity of the personating Spirit and would with just reasoning confirm to us the validity of the Message and of the Messenger also  AND yet 'tis very reasonable to believe that Sir  George Villers  thus seeming to appear and whose Surface or Outside is put on like a Masquerade Habit upon this Occasion knew nothing of it and had no manner of concern in it Nothing is more wonderful in any part of the Story to me than that Men of Sense and Learning as some such have been could be prevailed upon or rather could prevail upon themselves to publish to the World such incongruous such irrational things as these that a Man dead perhaps twenty Years before I think it's so much at least should appear and say he could not rest in Peace for such and such things And in another of the same Author's Stories an Apparition is brought in appearing to Dr  Turberville  's Sister being a Lady who was dead and had left some Children to her Husband which Children were injur'd  by a second Wife contrary to the Settlement of the first Wife's Marriage and this Settlement of the first Marriage was it seems hid behind the Wainscot in such and such a Place which no body knew of but the Children's Mother that is to say the first Wife This Lady appeared to discover where this Writing lay and tells the Person to whom she discover'd it that 'till she had made this Discovery she had wander'd in the Air but that now she was going to God  STRANGE that Mr  Glanvil A  brey  and others could publish such a Story as this without some just Enquiries to reconcile it to common Sense as well as to Religion as particularly how long this Lady had been Dead for it seems to have been some Years the Husband being married again and the Children being in danger of being wrong'd by the Children of the second Venter Now did the Soul of the first Lady wander all that while in the Air to see whether there should be any occasion for her to vindicate her Children's Right or no did she stay from going to God all that while only for discovering a conceal'd Deed that her Children might not be wrong'd how shall we make such a thing out to be rational what Notions of Religion or of a future State will support it  WHY did she not immediately discover where the Deed or Marriage Settlement lay and put it into the Hands of some honest People in Trust for her Children and then she had not need to have wander'd in the Air 'till it had been done  THEY must have very lowpriz'd Thoughts of Heaven and of going to God after the departing or separating of the Soul from the Body in Life who think the Passage can be interrupted by any of the Affairs of this Life left unfinish'd If even our Repentance unfinish'd our Peace with God unfinish'd  can never be retreiv'd if Time is not to be recalled but that  as the Tree falls so it shall lie  Shall we pretend the Soul shall be stopped and interrupted in its Passage to retrieve the Injustice and Violence done to the Orphans or Relicts of the Family shall the Soul be brought back to find out old hidden Parchments or as it is pretended in other like Stories to dig up old longburied Money and the like  NO no those things should be done in time like Rep  ntance they should not be left to that Hazard for we may depend there is no Work or Device or Invention in the Grave whither we are all going  THAT there are invisibe Agents which in Pursuance of the Government of Providence in the World may be made Instruments to act in such Cases as these to discover Writings which being conceal'd may ruin Families rob and plunder Orphans and distress the right Heirs of Estates and i  many like Cases this need not be deny'd and is inde  d not to b  disputed and 'tis a glorious Testimony to the Justice of Providence that in such Cases he does not abandon the Widows and the Orphans who for want of lost or conceal'd Deeds are sometimes in Danger of being undone by Violence and R  pine But all this is easier to be understood to be done without Interruption of the ordinary Course of Things without obstructing the Soul's Passage into its determined state of Happiness or Misery which it must be the weakest and indeed the wickedest thing in the World to think can be diverted by these Trifles and whose direct Progression is plainly stated in the Scripture in these Words  It is appointed unto all Men once to die and after Death to Judgment  or immediately after Death to Judgment at least so as nothing to prevent or intervene  Heb  ix  It is appointed  and sur  ly  these things can never break in upon that solemn Appointment  BESIDES 'tis an evident Impeachment of the Power and Justice as well as the Wisdom of Providence in his Disposition of things as if he could not find out Ways to do right to injur'd Orphans or to detect the Injustice and Oppression of violent and unreasonable Men but the Soul of the departed Mother must be kept out of Heaven to do it her self Horrid Absurdity and inconsistent with all the Notions that true Religion has inspir'd us with relating to a Future State and to the Gulph that is fix'd betwen this and that  THE Soul can no more be kept out from or delay'd its Entrance into Heaven if its Portion be appointed for Happiness by any Concern for the Affairs of this World than it can b  disq  iet  d after it is entered those Realms of Peace and disturbed or brought back from thence upon any Account whatsoever  THE very thoughts of it are so mean so lowrated and base that 'tis unworthy of our Reason but especially of our Christian reasoning Powers to ent  rtain them I take this Absurdity indeed to be much of the Cause of that just Ridicule which the wiser Part of Mankind have put upon most of the Stories which are told among us about Witchcraft and Apparitions for that they are told with such evident Inconsistences that they cannot go down with rational People Who can believe what cannot be true who can make a serious thing of a piece of ridiculous Nonsense That a Soul dismiss'd from Life and going directly into Heaven shall be call'd back by the Cry of the Children after her with a  hold stay  Mother  come back  and come and  tell us where the Writings are for your Joyntur    or  we shall be undone  and the poor Mother Uncas'd Unembodied must come back  dismiss the Angels that were carrying her into  Abraham  's Bosom and bid them come for her another time and here she must hover about we know not how many Years to do Right to these Children Sure the same Power that could thus interrupt her Passage into Heaven might have prevented her separating from the Body and she might with as much ease and less injustice to her self have been kept out of the Grave as kept out of Heaven  BUT I am sick of the very Repetition the Delusion is so gross I say it is not to be wondered that we are shock'd by it in our belief of the thing call'd Apparition in general The ridiculous Part discredits the real Part and it being so sufeiting to our Reason to hear the first Part we throw off our Patience and will hear nothing at all of it  IT is true we should not do thus the Reality of the Thing abstracted from these distracted and enthusiastick Notions is not lessen'd 'tis our Business then to reject the foolish Part which indeed has almost smother'd and buried the rest in its Dust and Rubbish and let us judge rightly of things as they are There is no want of Examples where Providence permitting Apparition has made Discoveries of villainous and dishonest Ac  ions and Designs detected Violence and Murther done Right to injur'd and oppress'd Widows and Fatherless Children and this without such a monstrous and inconsistent Addition as that of bringing back the Soul from its Entrance into Heaven or disturbing its Rest and Peace in a future State things too gross to be so much as nam'd among Christians whose Faith in things Future is too well establish'd to be capable of receiving any Impressions from such Delusions  I HAVE an Example in Story very particular to this Case and which my Author assures me of the Truth of tho' never yet publish'd in Print The Story is told of the late Reverend Dr  Scot  a  Man whose Learning and Piety was eminent and whose Judgment was known to be so good as not to be easily imposed upon  THE Doctor as I have the Story related was sitting alone by the Fire either in his Study or his Parlour in  Broadstreet  where he liv'd and reading a Book his Door being shut fast and lock'd he was well assur'd there was no body in the Room but himself when accidentally raising his Head a little he was exceedingly surpriz'd to see sitting in an Elbow Chair at the other side of the Fireplace or Chimney an Antient grave Gentleman in a black Velvet Gown a long Whig and looking with a pleasing Countenance towards him  the Doctor  as if just going to speak  N B  Another Person relating this Story says the Antient Gentleman appear'd standing and having just opened the Door of the Doctor's Study he was come in and saluting the Doctor spoke first to him but the Difference is but small  THE Relations agree in this part that the Doctor was greatly surpriz'd at the sight of him and indeed the seeing him as sitting in a Chair was the most likely to be surprizing because the Doctor knowing the Door to be lock'd and then seeing a Man sitting in the Chair he must immediately and at first sight conclude him to be a Spirit or Apparition or  Devil  call it as you will whereas seeing him come in at the Door he might at first sight suppose him to be really a Gentleman come to speak with him and might think he had omitted fastning the Door as he intended to have done  BUT be it which of the two it will the Doctor appear'd in great disorder at the sight as he ac  nowledg'd to those to whom he told the Story and from whom I receiv'd this Account with very little remove of Hands between  THE Spectre it seems began for the Doctor had not Courage at first as he said to speak to it I say the Spectre or Apparition spoke first and desir'd the Doctor not to be frighted not to be surpriz'd for that he would not do him any hurt but that he came to him upon a Matter of great Importance to an injur'd Family which was in great danger of being Ruin'd and that tho' he the Doctor was a Stranger to the Family yet knowing him to be a Man of Integrity he had pitch'd upon him to do an act of very great Charity as well as Justice and that he could depend upon him for a punctual Performance  THE Doctor was not at first compos'd enough to receive the Introduction of the Business with a due attention but seem'd rather inclin'd to get out of the Room if he could and once or twice made some Attempt to knock for some of the Family to come up at which the Apparition appear'd a little displeas'd  BUT it seems he need not for as the Doctor said he had no power to go out of the Room if he had been next the Door or to knock for Help if any had been at hand  BUT here the Apparition seeing the Doctor still in Confusion desir'd him again to compose himself for he would not do him the least Injury or offer any thing to make him uneasie but desir'd that he would give him leave to deliver the Business he came about which when he had heard perhaps he would see less cause to be surpriz'd or apprehensive than he did now  BY this time and by the calm way of Discourse above mention'd the Doctor recover'd himself so much tho' not with any kind of Composure as to speak  IN the Name of God  says the Doctor  what art thou  I DESIRE you would not be frighted  says the Apparition  to him again I am a Stranger to you and if I tell you my Name you do not know it but you may do the Business without enquiring  THE Doctor continu'd still discompos'd and uneasie and said nothing for some time  THE Apparition spoke again to him not to be surpriz'd and receiv'd only for Answer the old ignorant Question  IN the Name of God what art thou  UPON this the Spectre seem'd displeas'd as if the Doctor had not treated him with Respect and expostulated a little with him telling him he could have terrify'd him into a Compliance but that he chose to come calmly and quietly to him and used some other Discourses so civil and obliging that by this time he began to be a little more Familiar and at length the Doctor ask'd  WHAT is it you would have with me  AT this the Apparition as if gratify'd with the Question began his Story thus  I LIV'D in the County of  I do not exactly remember the County he named but it was in some of the Western Counties of  England  where I left a very good Estate which my Grandson enjoys at this time But he is sued for the Possession by my two Nephews the Sons of my younger Brother  N B  Here he gave him his own Name the Name of his younger Brother and the Names of his two Nephews but I am not allow'd to publish the Names in this Relation nor might it be proper for many Reasons  HERE the Doctor interrupted and ask'd him how long the Grandson had been in Possession of the Estate which he told him wasYears intimating that he had been so long dead  THEN he went on and told him that his Nephews would be too hard for his Grandson in the Suit and would OUT him of the MansionHouse and Estate so that he would be in danger of being entirely ruin'd and his Family be reduc'd  STILL the Doctor could not see into the Matter or what he could do to help or remedy the Evil that threaten'd the Family and therefore ask'd him some Questions for now they began to be a little better acquainted than at first  SAYS the Doctor  And what am I able to do in it if the Law be against him  WHY  says the Spectre  it is not that the Nephews have any Right but the grand Deed of Settlement being the Conveyance of the Inheritance is lost and for want of that Deed they will not be able to make out their Title to the Estate  WELL  says the Doctor  and still what can I do in the Case  WHY  says the Spectre  if you will go down to my Grandson's House and take such Persons with you as you can trust I will give you such Instructions as that you shall find out the Deed or Settlement which lies concealed in a Place where I put it with my own Hands and where you shall direct my Grandson to take it out in your Presence  BUT why then can you not direct your Grandson himself to do this  says the Doctor  ASK me not about that  says the Apparition  there are divers Reasons which you may know hereafter I can depend upon your Honesty in it in the mean time and I will so dispose Matters that you shall have your Expences paid you and be handsomely allow'd for your Trouble  AFTER this Discourse and several other Expostulations for the Doctor was not easily prevail'd upon to go 'till the Spect  e seem'd to look angrily  and even to threaten him for refusing he did at last Promise him to go  HAVING obtain'd a Promise of him he told him he might let his Grandson know that he had formerly convers'd with his Grandfather but not how lately or in what Manner and ask to see the House and that in such an upper Room or Loft he should find a great deal of old Lumber old Coffers old Chests and such Things as were out of Fashion now thrown by and pil'd up upon one another to make room for more modish Furniture Cabinets Chests of Drawers and the like  THAT in such a particular Corner was such a certain old Chest with an old broken Lock upon it and a Key in it which could neither be turn'd in the Lock or pull'd out of it  N B  Here he gave him a particular Description of the Chest and of the Outside the Lock and the Cover and also of the Inside and of a private place in it which no Man could come to or find out unless the whole Chest was pull'd in Pieces  IN that Chest  says he  and in that place lyes the grand Deed or Charter of the Estate which conveys the Inheritance and without which the Family will be ruin'd and turn'd out of Doors  AFTER this Discourse and the Doctor promising to go down into the Country and dispatch this important Commission the Apparition putting on a very pleasant and smiling Aspect thank'd him and disappear'd  AFTER some Days and within the time limited by the Proposal of the Spectre the Doctor went down accordingly into  shire  and finding the Gentleman's House very readily by the Direction knock'd at the Door and ask'd if he was at home and after being told he was and the Servants telling their Master it was a Clergyman the  Gentleman came to the Door and very court  ously invited him in  AFTER the Doctor had been there some time he observ'd the Gentleman receiv'd him with an unexpected Civility tho' a Stranger and without Business They enter'd into many friendly Discourses and the Doctor pretended to have heard much of the Family as indeed he had and of hi Grandfather from whom Sir  says he  I perceive the Estate more immediately descends to yourself  AY  says the Gentleman  and shook his Head my Father died young and my Grandfather has left Things so confus'd that for want of one principal Writing which is not yet come to Hand I have met with a great deal of trouble from a couple of Cousins my Grandfather's Brother's Children who have put me to a great deal of Charge about it And with that the Doctor seeming a little inquisitive  BUT I hope you have got over it Sir  says he  NO truly  says the Gentleman  to be so open with you we shall never get quite over it unless we can find this old Deed which however I hope we shall find for I intend to make a general Search for it  I WISH with all my Heart you may find it Sir  says the Doctor  I DON'T doubt but I shall I had a strange Dream about it but last Night  says the Gentleman  A DREAM about the Writing  says the Doctor  I hope it was that you should find it then  I DREAM'D  says the Gentleman  that a strange Gentleman came to me that I had never seen in my Life and help'd me to look it I don't know but you may be the Man  I SHOULD be very glad to be the Man I am sure  says the Doctor  NAY  says the Gentleman  you may be the Man to help me look it  AY Sir  says the Doctor  I may help you look it indeed and I'll do that too with all my Heart but I wou'd much rather be the Man that should help you find it Pray when do you intend to make a search  TOMORROW  says the Gentleman  I had appointed to do it  BUT  says the Doctor  in what manner do you intend to search  WHY  says the Gentleman  'tis all our Opinion  that my Grandfather was so very much concern'd to preserve this Writing and had so much Jealousy that some that were about him would take it from him if they could that he has hid it in some secret Place and I'm resolv'd I'll pull half the House down but I'll find it if it be above Ground  TRULY  says the Doctor  he may have hid it so that you must pull the House down before you find it and perhaps not then either I have known such things utterly lost by the very Care taken to preserve them  IF it was made of something the Fire wou'd not destroy  says the Gentleman  I'd burn the House down but I'd find it  I SUPPOSE you have search'd all the old Gentleman's Ches  s and Trunks and Coffers over and over  says the Doctor  AY  says the Gentleman  and turn'd them all inside outward and there they lie of a heap up in a great Loft or Garret with nothing in them nay we knock'd three or four of them in Pieces to search for private Drawers and then I burnt them for Anger tho' they were fine old Cypress Chests that cost Money enough when they were in Fashion  I'M sorry you burnt them  says the Doctor  NAY  says the Gentleman  I did not burn a scrap of them 'till they were all split to Pieces and it was not possible there cou'd be any thing there  N B  This made the Doctor a little easy for he began to be surpriz'd when he told him he had split some of them out and burnt them  WELL Sir  says the Doctor  if I can do you any Service in your Search I'll come and see you again tomorrow and wait upon your Search with my good Wishes  NAY  says the Gentleman  I don't design to part with you since you are so kind to offer me your Help you shall stay all Night then and be at the first of it  THE Doctor had now gain'd his Point so far as to make himself acquainted and desirable in the House and to have a kind of Intimacy so that tho' he made as if he would go he did not want much En  reaties to make him stay so he consented  o lie in the House all Night  A LITTLE before Evening the Gentleman ask'd him to take a Walk in his Park but he put it off with a Jest I had rather Sir  said he smiling  you'd let me see this fine old Mansion House that is to be demolish'd tomorrow methinks I'd fain see the House once before you pull it down  WITH all my Heart  says the Gentleman  So he carry'd him immediately up Stairs shew'd him all the best Apartments and all his fine Furniture and Pictures and coming to the Head of the great StairCase where they came up offer'd to go down again  BUT Sir  says the Doctor  shall we not go up higher  THERE'S nothing there  says he  but Garrets and old Lo  ts full of Rubbish and a Place to go out into the Turret and the Clockhouse  O LET me see it all now we are a going  says the Doctor  I love to see the old lofty Towers and Turrets the Magnificence of our Ancestors tho' they are out of Fashion now Pray let us see all now we are going  WHY it will tire you  says the Gentleman  NO no  says the Doctor  if it don't tire you that have seen it so often it won't tire me I assure you Pray let us go up So away the Gentleman goes and the Doctor after him  AFTER they had rambled over the wild Part of an oldbuilt great House which I need not describe he passes by a great Room the Door of which was open and in it a great deal of old Lumber And what Place is this pray  says the Doctor  looking in at the Door but not offering to go in  O THAT'S the Room  says the Gentleman softly because there was a Servant attending them  that's the Room I told you of where all the old Rubbish lay the Chests the Coffe  s and the Trunks look there see how they are pil'd up upon one another almost to the Ceiling  WITH this the Doctor goes in and looks about him for this was the Place he was directed to and which he wanted to see He was not in the Room two Minutes but he found every thing just as the Spectre at  London  had describ'd went directly to the Pile he had been told of and fixes his Eye upon the very Chest with the old rusty Lock upon it with the Key in it which would neither turn round nor come out  ON my Word Sir  says the Doctor  you have taken Pains enough if you have rumag'd all these Drawers and Chests and Coffers and every thing that may have been in them  INDEED Sir  says the Gentleman  I have emptied every one of them myself and look'd over all the  old musty Writings one by one with some help indeed but they every one past thro' my own Hand and under my Eye  WELL Sir  says the Doctor  I see you have been in earnest and I find the thing is of great Consequence to you I have a strange Fancy come into my Head this very Moment will you gratify my Curiosity with but opening and emptying one small Chest or Coffer that I have cast my Eye upon there may be nothing in it for you are satisfy'd I believe that I was never here before but I have a strange Notion that there are some private Places in it which you have not found perhaps there may be nothing in them when they are found  THE Gentleman looks at the Chest smiling I remember opening it very well and turning to his Servant  Will says he  don't you remember that Chest Yes Sir  says Will  very well I remember you were so weary you sat down upon the Chest when every thing was out of it you clap'd down the Lid and sat down and sent me to my Lady to bring you a Dram of Citron you said you were so tir'd you was ready to faint  WELL Sir 'twas only a Fancy of mine and very likely to have nothing in it  'TIS no matter for that  says the Gentleman  you shall see it turn'd bottom up again before your Face and so you shall all the rest if you do but speak the Word  WELL Sir  says the Doctor  if you will oblige me but with that one I'll trouble you no farther  IMMEDIATELY the Gentleman causes the Coffer to be drag'd out and open'd for it would not be lock'd the Key would neither lock it nor unlock it when the Papers were all out the Doctor turning his Face another way as if he would  look among the Papers but taking little or no Notice of the Chest stoop'd down and as if supporting himself with his Cane chops his Cane into the Chest but snatcht it out again hastily as if it had been a Mistake and turning to the Chest he claps the Lid of it down and sits down upon it as if he was a weary too  HOWEVER he takes an Opportunity to speak to the Gentleman softly to send away his Man a Moment for I wou'd speak a Word or two with you Sir  says he  out of his hearing and then recollecting himself Sir  says he aloud  can you not send for a Hammer and a Chisel  YES Sir  says the Gentleman  Go  Will says he to his Man  fetch a Hammer and Chisel  AS soon as  Will  was gone Now Sir  says he  let me say a bold Word to you I have found your Writing I have found your Grand Deed of Settlement I'll lay you a hundred Guineas I have it in this Coffer  THE Gentleman takes up the Lid again handles the Chest looks over every Part of it but could see nothing he is confounded and amaz'd What d'ye mean  says he to the Doctor  you have no unusual Art I hope no Conjuring in hand here's nothing but an empty Coffer  NOT I upon my Word  says the Doctor  I am no  Magician  no  CunningMan  I abhor it but I tell you again the Writing is in this Coffer  THE Gentleman knocks and calls as if he was frighted for his Man with the Hammer but the Doctor sat compos'd again upon the Lid of the Coffer  AT last up comes the Man with the Hammer and Chisel and the Doctor goes to work with the Chest knocks upon the flat of the Bottom  Hark  says he  don't you hear it Sir  says he  don't you hear it plainly  HEAR what  says the Gentleman  I don't understand you indeed  WHY the Chest has a double Bottom Sir a false Bottom  says the Doctor  don't you hear it sound hollow  IN a Word they immediately split the inner Bottom open and there lay the Parchment spread abroad flat on the whole breadth of the Bottom of the Trunk as a Quire of Paper is laid on the flat of a Drawer  IT is impossible for me to describe the Joy and Surprize of the Gentleman and soon after of the whole Family for the Gentleman sent for his Lady and two of his Daughters up into the Garret among all the Rubbish to see not the Writing only but the Place where it was found and the Manner how  YOU may easily suppose the Doctor was caress'd with uncommon Civilities in the Family and sent up after about a Week's stay in the Gentleman's own Coach to  London  I do not remember whether he disclos'd the Secret to the Gentleman or no I mean the Secret of the Apparition by which the Place where the Writing was to be found was discover'd to him and who oblig'd him to come down on purpose to find it I say I do not remember that Part neither is it material As far as I had the Story related so far I have handed it forward and I have the truth of it affirmed in such a manner as I cannot doubt it  NOW to observe a little upon this Passage which I am oblig'd to say is reported to me for Truth and I firmly believe it to be so Certain it is that finding this Writing was of the utmost Importance to the Family and tho' I am not indeed inclin'd to publish Names to the Story or to examine into the Particulars by discoursing with the Persons for some may be yet Living yet I say the Establishment  of not a Family only but a Generation of Families might depend upon this Writing and that no doubt made the antient Gentleman lay it up so safe But why then might not Providence permit nay even direct one of those Intelligent Spirits or Angels mention'd above to give this Notice and in this manner where the main and only Deed or Charter for the Inheritance was to be found as well as it has upon many like Occasions or in Cases alike in their Importance made strange and unaccountable Discoveries of Things hid for many Ages and this without Apparition but by a manifest concurrence of Causes and Accidents next to Miracles  I CANNOT think but that Providence whose Concern for the good and safety of his Creatures is so Universal and who it must be acknowledg'd is not unconcern'd even in the minutest Circumstances may think meet to bring such a thing as this to Light upon which the good and welfare of a whole Family did so much depend and even to appear in an extraordinary Manner in it without any Impeachment of its Wisdom or its Power and if the same Providence that thought fit to save this Family from so much Injustice as at that time threaten'd it thought fit to do it by the Agency of a Spirit coming in Apparition to a third Person so to bring it about as in the ordinary Method what have we to do to dispute the manner or what just Objection lies against it  UPON the whole here's no  Devil  here no imaginary Phantoms in the Air no Voices and Noises delusive and imposing upon the Fancy one way o  other no Soul appearing and pretending it cannot be at rest and yet here is an Apparition directing to find out what was in Being and was to be found and what Justice required should be produc'd  NOR could this be the  Devil  that wicked Agent goes up and down upon a much worse Employment He is busy enough that's true but 'tis wid'ning breaches in Families not healing them in prompting Mischief not preventing it tempting Man to Robbery to Whoredom to Murther not moving them to repent As is the Errand such is the Messenger as is the Work such is the Labourer and the way of judging is as just as it is certain 'tis easy and plain we cannot fail to know who and who's together  'TIS the same in our most retir'd Thoughts we may very well know who talks to us by the Discourse who tempts us by the Mischief he tempts to My good wicked pious hellish Friend and old Acquaintance  ZG  must never tell me that he does not know by whose Direction he transacts and who he converses with when he is bid to break Oaths and Promises under the cover of Conscience when he assaults Innocence by Clamour and levies War by Slander against Reputation and Virtue on pretence of Zeal to Truth blackning Characters in pretence of giving the Innocent Person opportunity to clear himself I say he must not do this without knowing from whence he derives the extraordinary Motion to it what Spirit prompts and from whose dictates he takes the Direction  WHEN he daubs on purpose to wash and sullies with intention to clean the Faces of his Innocent Neighbours he knows as well as I he is actuated from Hell and agitated  ab Inferis  because he knows that all Hypocri  y is from the  Devil  and as he knows himself to be a most accomplish'd Che  t even from the outside of his Face to the inside of his Soul he may sing after my Lord of  Rochester  in his Sarcasm upon a much honester Man  He said O Lord O Lord of Hosts  I am a Ral that thou know'st  'TIS a strange Hypothe  is that a late Visionist in those pieces of secret History attack'd me with t'other Day  viz  That he would undertake to prove from the late Reverend and Learned but to himself unintelligible  Jacob Behemen  that a Man's Soul was capable of comprehending GOD  Futurity Eternity  and all occult and retir'd things of the utmost importance but it self but that for divers wise Reasons the light of selfknowledge was hid from his Eyes except by immediate Revelation which immediate Revelation Friend  Jacob  pretended to have attained only with this unhappy disaster attending it  viz  That he could never express himself no not to his own Understanding so that indeed he understood this only namely that he could not understand what he did understand  NOW to leave Friend  Jacob  to his own Quibbles and to his three and twenty Parenthesis like a nest of Boxes one within another and never to be prolated 'tis my Opinion that if Mankind will be faithful to themselves they may always know themselves that Friend  G  not only always has the  Devil  in him but always knows it as it is certain that he that wilfully  Lyes  and  Cheats  always knows that he  Lyes  and  Cheats  so it is impossible  TE  should be a compleat Rogue and not know it he may be indeed not able to know how much a Rogue he is 'till the  Devil  and he have drawn out the Thread to its full length and tried him effectually search'd him to the bottom and seen whether he will stop at any thing or no and what the wicked thing can be that is too gross for him But he cannot be  ignorant of himself in the main he cannot be so blind to his own Inside as not to know that he is an Original Knave that he has broken in upon Principles betray'd Trust cheated Orphans abus'd Widows sold Friendship and a thousand such things as these already and that he has nothing for it but to put as good an Outside upon it as he can to have the Face of an honest Man upon the Heart of a Hypocrite and to be sure to be a Cheat to the World to the end of the Chapter  INDEED it might not have been improper to have represented those two worthy Gentlemen as Apparitions for that they are such is a most improving Truth and what it may be much for the Service of the World to have publickly known But as we are now speaking of Apparitions which represent Men and things as they really are it seems first needful to bring their insides to be their outsides and then the World may know them by their shadows as well as by their substance and for this I doubt we must wait a while the Issue of an Assizes or two for certainly if Justice takes place they may both be heard of at the Gallows  BUT to bring it home to the present purpose I insist that no Man can be deceiv'd in himself he may know whether he is a Knave or an honest Man whether he is a Substance or an Apparition whether he be a Re  lity or a Shadow and that  Jacob Behemen  advanc'd only a Delusion proper for a Knave pretending that a Man might be honest when he believ'd himself to be a Knave and be a Knave when he thought himself honest  BUT to return to the Affair of the Writing found in the Chest and which according to the Notion which some have of these things the Soul of the antient Gentlemen above came in Apparition to discover our Question is first How did he come to know in his determin'd State his State of SoulExistence  be that where it would I say How did he come to know that the Writing was not discover'd and that his Grandson was in danger of coming to any injury about it How did he know that the LawSuit was commenc'd the thing prosecuted so far and the damage like to be suffer'd so very much  HE might know where it was if not found because he hid it there because he laid it up with so much care but he could not know what Circumstance had been attending the case since that time what proceedings had been at Law and how things stood with the Family if he could then the Text quoted before out of  Job  cannot be true that  the Son riseth and falleth and the Father knoweth it not  'TIS observable that this Apparition which came to Doctor  Scot  did not alledge that he could not rest 'till this matter was discover'd he seem'd concern'd that the Family would be uneasy and that they were so and that there was great danger they might lose the Estate but did not pretend he could not rest in Peace or as the other that he could not go to Heaven 'till it was discover'd  I CANNOT but wonder a little at the Ignorance of the Ancients in that Notion of the Soul's wandring in the Air all the while the Body was without a Funeral Obsequy for according to their Doctrine those Souls who had no such Funeral Pyre prepared for them must have been wandring in the Air to this Day and will be so for ever not being able to get admittance either in one place or other  NO wonder the Air is said to be so fill'd with wandring Spirits with Daemons and Ghosts as some are of the Opinion it is for where must all the Millions of Spirits be gone who have lain without Burial or been cast into the Sea or been  overwhelm'd with Earthquakes and Storms or died by Plagues where the living have nor been sufficient to bury the dead and the like in many publick Calamities  I KNOW the  Roman  Catholicks have a way of performing a Service for the dead by Thousands and in particular for the Souls of the dead slain in such and such a Battel whether that has any relation to this old Pagan Notion or not I will not say I know Popery has pretty much of the Pagan in their Original I mean of their Worship but will saying one Service for the dead answer the End whether they have any Burial or no and tho' their Bodies are left as  Achilles  says of  Hector  for greedy or hungry Dogs to rend This they do not answer and I doubt cannot so that perhaps all those Souls kill'd in fight are wandring still in the Air and cannot have admittance no not to the Shades below  ON the other hand if the poor Soldiers believ'd that if they were kill'd in fight they were to wander for ever and not be pray'd out of Purg  ory nay not be admitted into it few of them but would chuse to be hang'd provided they might be admitted to be bury'd under the Gallows rather than go to the War and die in the Bed of Honour  THEY tell us who pretend to know that the Corps of the deceas'd Princes of  France  as well Kings as Princes of the Blood are not buried but deposited in the Abbey of St  Dennis  near  Paris  'till the immediate Successor is Dead and that then the Pr  d  cessor is buried and the next is deposited so that there is always one kept above Ground  I DO not take upon me to determine the Matter or to say whether it is really so or not But if so and i  should be as in the case of  Patroclus  that those H  roes are then to be out of the happy Regions  I must say their Kings are but little beholden to that Custom and  Lewis  XIII had a hard time of it to have his Son hold it Years and keep him all that while even out of Purgatory and how long he has to stay there who knows but 'tis c  tain he might have been or Years onward of his way by this time if he had not been so many Years unburied  BUT enough of this Pagan and Popish Frippery our business is to talk to the more rational World their Fate is before them all Men die and after Death to Judgment nothing can interrupt it and what their Sons do or suffer behind them they know not  CHAP XIII Of the Consequence of this Doctrine and seeing that Apparitions are real and may be expected upon many Occasions and that we are sure they are not the Souls of our departed Friends how are we to act and how to behave to them when they come among us and when they pretend to be such and such and speak in the first Person of those departed Friends as if they were really themselves  HAVING thus settled the main point and determin'd what Apparition is not namely not an Angel immediately from Heaven not a return'd unembodied Soul and having advanc'd in Essay at least what we are to suppose them to be namely a good or evil Spirit from the Invisible World and having settled the Rule of judging whether of  the two whether a good or an evil according to the apparent good or evil of their Design it is time now to bring the matter into Practice to settle the grand Preliminary and determine since this is their Behaviour to us how we are to behave to them  NOR is this a needless Enquiry for we find the World at a great loss on such Occasions Men are exceedingly terrified and discorded upon the very Apprehensions of seeing any thing  as they call it  from the Invisible World even the great King  Belshazzar  tho' in the midst of his whole Court the Lords of Provinces a full Assembly of Ladies and Courtiers yet when he saw but a piece of an Apparition for it was but one Hand yet  his Countenance chang'd and the joynts of his Knees were loosed and his Knees smote one against another  Dan v  Charles  VIII of  France  was not frighted only but frighted out of his Wits with an Apparition in the Forest of  Mans  and never recover'd his Senses any more and we have several instances in Story of Men even of the greatest Resolution who have lost all their Courage and all their Resolution when they have had but a short Visit of this kind tho' without receiving any injury from them  BUT whence is it that the Mind is thus surpriz'd why is our Aversion so great to any appearance from the other World without so much as enquiring into the Particulars  THERE are many Reasons indeed to be assign'd to prove why  it is so  but not one good Reason that I know of to prove  it should be so  or that we have any Occasion to be so alarm'd and disturb'd at these Appearances I mean when the Mind has any degree of Composure It is true they come from an Invisible Place and that is one of the Reasons of our fright because as we say we know not  whence they are of what Errand they come with what Commission and with what Power to execute that Commission all these uncertainties bring a Terror upon the Spirits the Soul receives a shock the Man is like one of those poor People where they are in an Earthquake they see the Buildings totter and fall before them and tho' they are not bury'd in the Ruins but are perhaps escap'd out into the Fields yet they feel the Earth roll and move under them and they are doubtful and apprehensive le  t they may be swallowed up every Moment and according to the old Poet it is Matter of real Terror  "Fear chills the Heart what Heart can Fear dissemble  "When Steeples stagger and when Mountains tremble  THIS uncertainty of the Mind in the case of Apparitions is the real ground of Fear  viz  that we know not  WHENCE their Errand comes WHAT Commission they have WHAT Power to execute the Commission  FIRST  WE don't know whence they are and from whom their Errand nor indeed can we be easie in the uncertainty The reason is there is a secret doubt of the Mind founded upon Guilt Here the Atheist bauks his assurance and tho' he pretends to believe neither God or  Devil  staggers at a Messenger that comes for ought he knows from one or both of them to convince him by immediate demonstration Here his Heart fails him he turns pale starts at the sight and would be glad to be assur'd there were really both that one might protect him from the other  WHILE he knows not whether the Message comes from Heaven or Hell whether the Messenger  may be Angel or  Devil  the uncertainty attended with the real Danger of the worst leaves him in Horror and he fears Hell because he knows he has provok'd Heaven he fears the  Devil  because he knows he that can command the  Devil  is his Enemy  IN a Word a sense of God makes men afraid of the  Devil  as they say fear of the  Devil  gives a sense of Homage to God  SECONDLY  WE tremble at the Messenger because we don't know what his Message may be we dread the Officer because we dread his Commission we are afraid of what he has to say we know we have no reason to expect good News from the place which we suppose he comes from and therefore we turn pale at his coming nor is it possible to be otherwise  THERE are but two Principles that fortifie the Mind against the Fears of a future State no not that seeming  y fortifie it and these are  INNOCENCE or a good Heart founded in Religion Virtue and an exact rectitude of behaviour OR  IMPUDENCE a harden'd shutting the Eyes against Conv  ction and the Ears against Conscience  IT is with some Perplexity that I found my self oblig'd to give a Character in another place of a fam'd Man of pretended Brightness and Wit He was always merry a constant Smile sat upon his Countenance a perfect easiness possess'd his Mind he knew not a Moment of Melancholly or Chagrin He never sigh'd because he seldom pray'd or griev'd I wish I could have said because he never sinn'd His Heart was light as his Head and as for his Heels he always walk'd in Minuit and Rigadoons His Mirth was as uninterrupted as his Breath and he laugh'd by the Consequence of Respiration  his Voice was a natural Music and his Rhetoric was all Sonnet and Solfa's  SURE said I my Cousin  M    D  must have the clearest Conscience in the Universe he has not the least  Scar  upon his Inside and if he was to see the  Devil  he could not change Colour or have the least Hesitation at the most frightful Appearance He must be all Innocence and Virtue  Did the least Spot upon his Soul appear  It could not be his Conscience must be clear  For where there's Guilt there always would be Fear  BUT I mistook my Kinsman most extremely for on the contrary his Soul is blacker than  Negro Sancho  the Beauty of  Africa  he boasts himself of the most harden'd Crime defies Heaven despises Terror and is got above Fear by the meer force of a flagrant Assurance  HE would no more value seeing the  Devil  in his most fiery formidable Appearance than he would to see a storm of Fire in  the Tempest  or a Harlequin  Diable  in  Fresco  if you will take his Character from himself he has no more fear about him than he has Conscience and that's so little 'tis not worth naming He knows no Sorrow no Chagrin he was born Laughing and intends to die Jesting and what is all this founded upon not glorious Innocence mention'd above but notorious Impudence  IT'S true indeed I had not car'd to speak so grosly of one of my near Relations but he will have it be so he speaks it of himself bids me take notice of it that 'tis the Character he gives me of himself and ds me with a full Stream of  Billinsgate  if I dare to give any other Character of him than what he gives of himself  I MUST acknowledge I did believe the  Devil  and my Cousin were not much at Strife that he did  not fear the old Dragon b  cause he had never done any thing to disoblige him but it seems the Case differs and he defies the  Devil  purely upon the same foot that he defies him that made the  Devil  and acts the Fury meerly as a Fury not as a Man of Sense or as a Man of Courage  ALL that I have to say to this is that this will last just 'till the Rage is abated and no longer 'till the Blood cools and the Spirits return to their natural Course and then the Wretch will be as cold as now he is hot as calm as now he is outragious and as base and lowspirited as now he is fiery and furious  ALL the hotheaded Courage of these Men is only a Flash a Meteor in the Air when they are cool'd when the Exhalation is spent they are as phlegmatic as other People and then they look pale the Countenance changes and the Knees knock one against another as well as other People's  THERE'S no scorning the Terrors of a Messenger from the other World but by a settled established Composure of the Soul founded on the Basis of Peace within Peace of Conscience Peace and Innocence or Peace and Penitence which is in effect all one This is the only Face that a Man can hold up to the  Devil  with a clean Heart he may boldly see the  Devil  talk to him despise him and tell him he scorns him for that he has nothing at all to do with him  BUT this is not our present Condition few People wear this Armour in our days they neither value it or know the use of it and therefore 'tis that we are so full of Terror and Disturbance when we see the  Devil  at least if we think he has any thing to say to us  BUT now for the great Question Why it should be so as I said 'tis Truth too evident that it is so  but to say that it  should be so  that requires another kind of Sophistry to make out  IT is true it requires a great deal of Courage and of cool Courage too in bearing up the Soul against the Surprize of such things as these a Man must be able to talk to the  Devil  in a Dialect which he  Satan  himself does not very well understand to bid him be gone to bid him  Get thee behind me  and the like 'tis an authoritative way of talking that every one cannot support and if the  Devil  is sensible of it he will not fail to exert himself to the utmost to maintain the Right which he seems to enjoy and keep the Hold he has gotten for he knows how ill his Cause is to be defended by Justice and Reason and if he should answer as he did to the Sons of  Scev  the  Jew  what then if you should say to him in the vulgar and ignorant Dialect of speaking to Spirits In the Name of the  Father  and of the  Son  and of the  Holy Ghost  Who art thou or I charge thee in the Name of the  Father  c to be gone and disturb me no more  I SAY if the  Devil  should answer The  Father  I know and the  Son  I know and the  Holy Ghost  I know but who are you you that pretend to use their Names thus What would you say for your self  NOW that we may know how to answer the  Devil  as well as how to speak to him for both are very necessary let me enter into the State of the Case a little between the  Devil  and us nay between all the Inhabitants of the invisible World and their Friends in this let them be who or of what kind they will  FIRST In order to be free from the Surprize of these things you must endeavour to establish your Mind in the right understanding of the thing call'd Apparition that you may reason your self into a sufficient Firmness and Steadiness of Soul  against all the whimsical and imaginary Part of it  LET us think of things as they are not as they are only imagined and supposed to be for 'tis the Reality of the thing not the Shadow that can fright and disorder us that is to say that can have any just Reason to do so  FOR want of this we are often scared and terrify'd with Dreams and Visions even when we are awake and when really there is no such thing in Substance or Reality as any Vision or Apparition other than Apprehension throws in upon us and other than our bewitched Imagination represents to us  IT is absolutely necessary if you would not be always looking over your Shoulders and always forming Spectres to your Fancy I say 'tis necessary to have a right Notion of Apparition in general to know what it is and what it must be whence it comes and what the utmost of its Commission can be that you may think your self into a true and clea  Understanding of it and then your Fears about it will be regulated after another manner For Example  ESTABLISH your Mind in this particular and fundamental Article that whatever appears it must be either  a good Spirit  from the invisible World an Agent of Mercy a Messenger of Peace and consequently  will do  you no Hurt OR  AN  evil Spirit  an Agent of Hell from Satan's Region and Empire the Air and that so whatever evil Design or evil Message he pretends to come about and however mischievous his Intention is he  cannot  do the Hurt he desires because that as the good Spirits are under Direction so the bad are under Limitation the one  will not  and the other  cannot  hurt you without an immediate Command from above The Fear therefore  which we have upon us concerning Apparition is not or ought not to be guided by their Appearance but by the rectitude of our own Thoughts and as we are or are not quiet and calm within so we shall or shall not be under Apprehensions from without  FORTIFY your Minds then with a steady Confidence in the Supreme Maker and Governour of all things who has the great red Dragon in a Chain and when you think you see the  Devil  fear nothing for He will never let loose the Destroyer upon any one whose Mind is steadily fix'd upon himself  THIS is a critical and perhaps a too curious Piece of Practice for me to meddle with especially here and must be but gently touch'd at you will it may be object too against the Doctrine of it and say Who can so effectually trust in God as not to be at all afraid of the  Devil  Now tho' this may seem true upon many Accounts and as Times go with us may be really a just Objection yet if we will believe History or Experience it is not so much a Difficulty as to say Who can do it for it has been done  I REMEMBER the known and famous Story of a Maid under a real and personal Possession of the  Devil  at  Little Gadsden  in  Hertfordshire  tho' by an unhappy Disappointment I was not present not knowing of the thing time enough yet I saw and convers'd with several that were present and heard the  Devil  speak in the Maid and by the Organ of her Voice tho' without any apparent Motion of her Tongue or Lips or any Part of her Mouth  OF this Person it was positively true that there was a certain good Man tho' a Lay Christian who so frequently pray'd with the poor Demoniack being a Neighbour of her Father's and so constantly talk'd to the  Devil  and batter'd  him with Scripture that he was as I might say the  Devil  's Terror and he would not let the Girl go to any House or into any Room where this Man whose Name was  Monks  was and if she was directed to any Place he would stop her as if he was to go and see first if Mr  Monks  was there or not and then he would bid her go for  Monks  was not there  NOW as I am well assured of the Truth both of the Girl's being possessed really actuated by a  Devil  in her and of this  Devil  being afraid of Mr  Monks  then the Q  stion above is so far directly answer'd that it is possible to arrive to such a State as not only not to be afraid of the  Devil  but even to make the  Devil  afraid of us I confess it would be a State of Felicity that would make Life very easie to us upon many Accounts and I could enlarge very pleasantly to my self upon that Subject But as things go with the World I question much whether it would be so pleasant to those I am writing to and therefore I leave it and so if I have been preaching a little it is so little in length and I hope so much to the purpose that you may forgive me for once e  pecially upon Promise of saying as little for your Good for the time to come as I can  THERE is indeed a right worthy and commendable State of Indifference not only as to Who shall or shall not visit us from the invisible World and from what Part of it they come but also as to what Station we are to have among them hereafter and this happy Temper is much recommended to me by some of my fashionable Friends as a most desirable Condition of Life to be perfectly easy void of Anxiety and Perplexities of any kind and forming the most perfect Composure of Soul that can be imagined  THEY describe this the most accurately indeed by the Practice for they say most feelingly that  no Tongue can express the Felicity of it which indeed I believe is very true they are perfectly easy about because thoughtless of that dull remote thing called Futurity As for there being a State of Life or a Something like Life after Death they can't say but it may be so for they never enquired much into the Principles of the  Saduces  or into any other Pricinciples about it But what that State is to be or what we are to be or not to be in it they never trouble themselves about it they look upon it as a thing remote which People are not agreed about and they believe never will 'till they come there and to be beating their Heads and perplexing their Thoughts about what when they have done all they are sure they shall never arrive to a Certainty about they do not see 'tis to the Purposeat all  THIS is certainly a mighty brief Way with their Doubts and a short answer to all Enquiries and I must own 'tis putting a short end to all Disputes with themselves about the thing called a  future State  BUT there remains a Question still unanswer'd and which is a Question of moment with me whatever it may be with them  viz  Where is the Felicity of this kind of Calm  O  says a Deist of my Acquaintance  Peace of Mind is a Felicity I hope  Yes  said I  if it be built upon a right Foundation  Nay  says he  Peace is Peace don't tell me of Foundations  Hold Friend  said I  even  Molinos  himself the Author of the  Quietisme  which one Author well calls  Sotisme  and of the Sect of the  Quietists  and who resolved all Felicity and all Religion into the Calm of a retired Soul yet fixed that Calm upon the Meditations of an upright Mind and the Calm of a clear Heart  I VALUE none of your Sects  says my Friend Gallio  was a true Politician and a happy Man  Acts  xviii  He cared for none of these things  and there was his Happin  ss  SO a Madman  says I  is happy in his Lunacy and enjoys a thoughtless Calm all the while he is in the greatest Hurry and Disorder of his Soul I  ay there's no Calm in Distraction  WELL but I am calm  says he  and yet I am not distracted  I DON'T know that  said I  I doubt the Fact  WELL if I am mad I don't know it  says he  and as I said before that's a Happiness to me  A HAPPINESS in Misery  said I  and such is all the Peace that such a Temper can give  BUT why is it not a sufficient Felicity  says he  to be calm and quiet  BECAUSE  said I  a Mind insensible and unmoved in Dangers of the greatest Importance is not consistent with the Condition it self or with Prudence and Reason under that Condition  HOW is it not consistent  says my Friend  WHY for Example suppose  says I  a Man in the upper Rooms of a House when all the lower Part was on Fire the Staircase and all Retreats cut off except throwing himself out of the Window if this Man sat smoking his Pipe or singing a Song or reading a Play would not you say he was demented and mad  BUT how are the Cases parallel  says he  EXACTLY  said I  they agree in every Part but this that he is certain the Fire is under him and you don't know but it may be so and don't think it worth while to enquire and to make it chime in that Part too you may suppose the Man ignorant too only that People call to him and tell him the House is on Fire and he does not so much as rise off his Seat to go to the Stairhead and see  whether it be so or no tho' he hears them and tells them he hears them he bids them not trouble their Heads about him 'tis time enough when he feels it and the next Moment the Floor falls under him and soon after the Roof falls in over him and so he is burnt to death  WHAT do you infer from this  says he  I ENQUIRE  said I  whether that Indolence and Unconcernedness be consistent with common Sense and if a wise Man would do so  SUPPOSE I grant it  said he  SO  says I  you must grant that an Indifference about what shall be our Share of that State which is beyond us Whether the bright or the dark is inconsistent with common Sense and that no wise Man can act so  HERE my Friend and I ended for instead of being touch'd with it he talk'd prophanely and then I always think 'tis time to leave off talking at all for when Men give up their Reason to Atheism and their Sense of GOD to Blasphemy who shall labour to wash that  Ethiop  IT is the same in the Case before me here is an Apparition or suppose it the Man that sees it is utterly unconcerned about it he cares not one Farthing whether it comes from above or from below whether it be an Angel or a  Devil  a Messenger from Hell or from Heaven and so this Man is not afraid of it but boldly goes up to it and like a Soldier cries Who are you for Whence come you What have you to say to me And it may be gives it for Answer Very well go about your Business then I have nothing to say to you And this sort of Courage as he calls it this unconcerned Bravery he recommends as the best way to deal with these Spirits  BUT suppose the  Devil  won't be put off so but says I'll come and Visit you tomorrow in another  Dress I'll try your Courage and at last masters this sort of indolent unconcern'd Easiness and the Man falls into Terror and Amazement what has he at the bottom to preserve him from the  Devil  then truly nothing but he is like  Cashio Burroughs  all trembling and cries out  O God here she comes  and is frighted even to Death Certainly a cold Indifference about it whether it be an Angel or the  Devil  and above all whether its Message be from Heaven or Hell will not hold it out against the Terror that may come along with it from without or the reflections of Guilt that may be raised by it from within so that some bettergrounded Courage a Calm begun from a better Principle must be enquir'd after or else as I said to my Deistical Friend when you do really see the  Devil  you will not be so easy as you promise your self to be But this is too serious for you I must go on  I COME next to the Enquiry What is our business and how should we behave if it is our misfortune to have any such Appearance come to us and suppose our Minds to be as much compos'd as ordinarily may be expected not more than our Neighbours but what  I say  shall we do and what is the best course for us to take  IN my Opinion and it is the next Advice I would give I say next to that of fortifying the Mind with religious Considerations of which I have spoken and which should always go first  speak to it  BY speaking to it my meaning is Speak tho' it does not speak to you I have heard of some Apparitions who 'tis said had no power to speak 'till they were first spoken to and some cases of that kind are publish'd by those who I suppose believ'd them tho' I see no reason to do so and particularly of an Apparition that caused a poor Man to follow it over Hedge and Ditch all Night for many a Night  together 'till the poor Man was almost hurry'd to Death but could not speak to him and the frighted Wretch was afraid to speak to it but at last the Man spoke and then the Apparition's Mouth was loosed too all which I must con  ess I see no manner of reason to believe and therefore cannot recommend it to any body else to believe  THERE seems no Consistency in the Nature of the thing no foundation for it in Religion or any thing in it that we can Reason upon for our own Understanding and where neither Nature Religion or Reason allow us any Light in it upon what Principle can we go to make our Judgment  BUT leaving it therefore where we find it I say if you see an Apparition that is such an Apparition as we have been speaking of not a Phantosm of your own Brain not an imaginary Apparition the effect of Fright or Dream or meer Whimsie not a Hypocondriack Apparition the effect of Vapours and Hysterick Shadows when the Eye sees double and Imagination makes it self a Telescope to the Soul not to show Realities but to magnify Objects at the remotest distance and show things as in being which are not if you see such an Apparition as this and speak to it 'tis no wonder you receive no answer and so you go away more frighted with a silent dumb  Devil  than you would be with a speaking one but I say if the Vision be real if it be a Shape and Appearance in form as has been describ'd never shun it and fly from it but  speak to it  IF you would ask me what you should say to it 'tis an unfair Question in some Respects 'tis not possible for any one to dictate without the proper Circumstances be describ'd The old way you all know  In the name of  c as above is the common road I will not cry down the Custom because 'tis the usual way and the words are good but I believe  a sincere mental Ejaculatory Prayer to the Blessed Being of Beings for his superior Presence would be as effectual as presenting the Words to the  Devil  as a kind of Exorcism such a Petition sent up and then a plain  what are you  I think is Compliment enough for the  Devil  AN honest plain religious  Scotsman  who I knew and who thought he saw the  Devil  tho' he was mistaken too yet had this to me perfectly new Expression upon the surprise  the Lord be between me and thee Satan awa  that is go away or get thee away 'twas certainly a good thought and the poor Man was right for if the Lord was between him and the  Devil  there was no great need to fear him or any of his  BUT to wave particular Instructions in the case the Occasion will certainly administer the Substance of what you should say the present Direction is only in general  speak to it  never sink under the Terror or Surprize of the sight The  Devil  is rarely seen in his own Shape and ordinarily for ends of his own he chuses to appear in familiar Shapes personating some or other that we know or have known and representing to our Fancy something that will not terrify us nay 'tis the Opinion of the learned Divines that the  Devil  would do much less harm and be far less dangerous if he appear'd as a meer  Devil  with his Horns his cloven Hoof and his Serpent's Tayl and Dragon's Wings as Fancy figures him out and as our Painters dress him up than he does in his disguises and the many Shapes and Figures he assumes to himself  So fatal are Masques and Disguises Habits and Dresses to the World and such advantage does a false Countenance give to Criminal Perf  rmances of many kinds that even the  Devil  is more dangerous dress'd up in Masquerade than in his own Cloaths and in his own Colours if he would come in all  his Formalities and Frightfuls he would not be capable of half so many Cousinings and Cheatings as he now puts upon us now you have him here and have him there you have him every where and no where he is here a Tempter to Wickedness there a Preacher of Righteousness today in one disguise tomorrow in another you know him and you don't know him see him and don't see him and how then can any one tell you what to say to him or how to talk with him  HOWEVER to come as near to it as we can the first and ordinary Question natural to the Occasion is to know who he is and whence he comes what Message he has to deliver what Business he comes about and what you have to do with it why he disturbs you in particular and the like and if you may obtain so much Civility from him to desire him to trouble you no more especially if you find the Apparition to be of the worst kind  IF it is apparently a good Spirit I think the Conduct should differ as the Message he comes about will certainly differ if it warns you to repent of such and such a scandalous Life or if it bids you reform such and such a criminal Practice which you know your self guilty of accept the kind Admonition submit to the Reproof and promise Obedience you may depend as I have often said the  Devil  com  s of no such Errand  IF it tells you such and such Dangers attend you take the kind hint and use the proper means to avoid th  m thankfully acknowledging the Goodness of the Hand that sent the Notice as well as the Messenger that brought it for depend upon it the  Devil  who is a Lover and Author as well as the Promoter of Mischief takes no Pains to prevent it but would rather have a Hand in bringing it upon you  AND if such things as these are the Subject of the Message what can you say why you should be afraid of the Messenger 'Tis hard to rejoice in the Message and be scar'd at the Messenger the truth is we are not much accustom'd to such solemn Admonitions such good and beneficent Cautions and Assistances and this makes the thing strange and aweful and be receiv'd with Terror and Fright and perhaps if it was not so we should receive them oftner  WE do not find the old Patriarchs or after them the Children of  Israel  were so frighted at the Apparition of Angels and Spirits it's true indeed when the Angel appear'd to  Gideon  at the ThreshingFloor it is said he was troubled at his Presence nevertheless the Message was kind and encouraging yet we find he recover'd himself and took Courage to talk very particularly with it and to expostulate with him about the Circumstances of his Country and of the People and even to ask a double Sign from the Angel to confirm his Faith and how went he on he obey'd the Voice of the Vision notwithstanding all his Fears and Doubts and he bow'd his Soul and follow'd the Directions given him  THERE are abundance of Reasons why we should listen to such Apparitions as these their distinguishing Character is that they always come of some Errand or other for the good of Mankind take it either in general or in particular Sometimes 'tis alledg'd they come upon trifling and mean Occasions as is the Case in many Instances given in Story and in Print But it may be answered with an Enquiry Are we sure these are not trifling Stories and brought in by Persons perhaps but half informed But what are we to think of the Apparition to King  James  V in  Scotland  who warn'd him against his  FloddenField  Expedition  which if he had listen'd to he had sav'd his Life and the Lives of ten thousand of his People for less 'tis said did not fall in the whole Undertaking  AND what shall we say of the Warning given to the Duke of  Buckingham  by the Apparition of his own Father which if he had listen'd to 'tis very likely he had escap'd the fatal Knife for  Felton  who Assassinated him did it as it seems he declar'd at the Gibbet upon the Account of the Popular Hatred and that he thought him a publick Enemy to his Country  THESE and many more which I have mention'd or which I have not mention'd have been the Subject of such Messengers and were far from trifling If an Appari  ion gives any of us Notice of our approaching End and bids us prepare for it is not the Message solemn and the Occasion of it weighty and is not the Notice worth our Regard Is the Preparation for Death a trifling thing and the assurance how near the time is cannot but be a valuable Notice I am sure it ought to be esteem'd so  A FLOUTING atheistick Man of Wit who must be nameless because he will not bear to be nam'd to the Crimes which he is not asham'd to commit told me when discoursing this Part of the Subject that it was no Kindness at all for that Men ought always to be prepar'd for Death and yet cou'd not deny but that it was a remote Affair which he had not yet given himself the trouble to think about  I CANNOT believe but that if some People who now value themselves upon their bright Thoughts and their being above the Power of Chagrine or of any melancholly Reflections to disturb their Joy were told nay tho' it was by a kind Apparition that they were to die one in a  Fortnight one in three Days one at one time and one at another and all within a short time they would have a little alteration upon their Outsides  GM  who laughs evermore is continually titt  r  ng and prompting others to the lowestpriz'd Part of Mirth who is all Levity and Froth and owns that one Sigh never yet reach'd his Heart should a solemn Apparition come to him and his merry Friend the very Duplicate of himself and say Repent  G  and prepare for Death for you have but three Months to live and you pointing to his Fellowmimick but five Days I say should such a Message be seriously delivered him in such an aweful Manner as many Relations tell us have been done to others I cannot have so little Charity for the Beau but to think he would change Colour a little and begin to consider and especially if at the five Days end he had News that his other Self the Image of his extraordinary Soul the very  Sosio  to himself in Life tho' not in Figure was found dead in his Bed to a tittle of the time  I SAY I cannot doubt but that he would learn to Sigh a little and my Charity is the more extensive in Mr  M  's Case because take him a little off of his ordinary Titillations and unhinge him from the light Article which has gain'd so entirely upon him as to Eclipse him the Man has ye  some Brains and they might perhaps assist a little upon such an Occasion to condense the Vapour and bring the solid Part uppermost which at present has not happen'd to him  AND not to single out a gay Humour or two from the rest how many among our  Box  and  Pit  Heroes were they told they were under the Sentence of Death and only Repriev'd for so many and so many Days I say how many of them would shine at the next Opera how would their Countenance  change and their Knees knock one against another How would they sit down in Tears and Repentance or sink into the Death foretold even by the meer Horror of its approach for there is the most Dread where there is the least Repentance Nor let any one cavil at the Expression a Sentence and a Reprieve let them take it as they will the thing is no less and can be understood no otherwise of us all We are all under the Sentence as directly as a Criminal that hears it read at the Bar with only this significant Difference namely That we are Repriev'd  sine die  the Criminal is not and the Consequence of this may be the worse for we promise ourselves it shall be longer than we have reason to believe it is and so are often Executed in Surprize our Preparations being delay'd by Presumption whereas the Offender knows he must die at the Expiration of his Reprieve and perhaps is assur'd that 'tis in vain to expect any farther delay  NOW a kind Messenger comes as the Prophet did to  Hezekiah  and says Prepare yourself for you shall die and not live is this Message to be slighted and disregarded If it is so treated 'tis at your Peril you take that Part upon yourself and if you find this the Case you will hardly call the Message trifling much less say such Apparitions generally come upon trifling Occasions  HISTORY records a great many foreboding Signs and some by Apparition foretelling the Destruction of  Jerusalem  and of the Temple not that any of those Signs could be suppos'd to give Warning of it so as that it might be prevented for our Saviour had expresly said it should be destroy'd  Their House should be left unto them desolate  Matt xxiii  Not one Stone left upon another which shall not be thrown down  Matt xxiv But those Signs and Apparitions were apparent Warnings  to the People at least to such of them as had the Wisdom to take Notice of them to make their Escape out of the City before the  Romans  invested it and before it was too late particularly the opening the great brazen Doors of the Temple which  Josephus  says twenty Man could scarce turn to open or shut and which opening of themselves an Apparition was seen in the House of GOD and a Voice heard saying  Let us Depart hence  NO question but as the Warning or Alarm was given to direct many to their Escape so many had that Wisdom given them as to make their Escape and tho' the Desolation was horrible and such as perhaps was never equall'd except in the same Place and the same Country by the  Assyrians  when the first Temple was burnt yet as they say 'tis a hard Battle where none escape so  Josephus  himself owns that many Thousands and others say many hundreds of thousands fled in time and made their Escape flying as the Text says  from the Wrath to come  Nor can I doubt but that many had warnings in Dreams that is as I say by Apparitions in Dream by Visions and some by open Apparitions that the City would be destroyed  RABBI JUDAH  says the Patriarchs appeared to many and gave them Notice that the  Romans  would come and besiege their City and that the Temple should be destroyed but I doubt much of the Story and that On a double Account Whether ever any of the Patriarchs did so appear and forewarn them for had they done so they would certainly have told them that the  Messiah  was come and that therefore the second Temple was to be destroy'd for that all the Prophesies were fulfill'd But I doubt also that  Rabbi Judah  if such an Author there was never said so and that 'tis only a Tradition  IT is certain there were the like Omens and I doubt not Apparitions too just before the taking and sacking of  Rome  by the  Barbarians  the  Vandals  and  Goths  and we might descend to modern History for many of the like so that these Apparitions do not always come upon trifling Occasions at least they are not trifling to those whom they regard in particular and therefore 'tis not an Objection for a particular Person to make  I HAVE troubled you with none of those Apparitions which have come to help you to find out Money to reveal little love Secrets and Intrigues and upon other such Cases nor do I recommend it to you to believe those Trifles they are most certainly the Apparitions of Fancy as I shall observe at large in its Place such People make a meer Harlequin of the  Devil  a common JackPudding to make Game with 'tis most certain the Spirits I speak of know how to make themselves be better regarded know how to make themselves considerable can come clothed in Terror if they please and have done so where occasion has call'd for it either to enforce their Message or alarm such Persons who set up for a hardened Face beyond the Power of invisible Terrors  BUT as their Message is generally peaceable and the Intent of it kind and good so they chuse to come in a manner as little attended with the frightful Part as they can  BUT not to dwell on this Part or enquire at all what the Message is they come about whether trifling or otherwise the present Enquiry is what is our Part what is to be done when they do appear For 'till we see them we know nothing of their Business nor perhaps when we see them unless we speak to them and we have many Stories of Apparitions that only show themselves and perhaps it may be never speak at all  THIS our People call  Walking  and indeed it is not improperly call'd so because as to us we know no more of their Business but it no more follows that they have no other Business here because we don't know it than that it is likely they should come hither and walk to and fro and have nothing to do  AS for those nonappearing Apparitions if I may call them so for not to appear and not to let us know what they appear for seems to be much the same I mean those notspeaking Apparitions we can indeed give no Account of them because we cannot converse with them It seems to me they are not of the Heavenly or Angelick Kind because they would certainly have some more apparent Business and perhaps not be backward to speak of it at least they would not seem to be ashamed of their Errand  NOR is it my Opinion that those Apparitions who come of good Errands can be supposed to be unable to speak if it was necessary to their Business to use Speech much less that they should receive their Commission or their Ability to speak from our first speaking to them There is no Coherence in it But certainly if the Spirits that appear upon good Designs and come upon good Errands do not speak to us they are not sent to us their Business is with somebody else which we know nothing of tho' we may see the Spectre for it may be that a Man may see an Apparition that has nothing to do with him or to say to him  OR perhaps the Spectre may execute its Commission effectually without speaking A Ghost was said to haunt a certain House in the Country not far from  Rygate  in  Surrey  it was met in the Garden by one of the Family who had long valued himself upon believing and saying also that there were no such things as Apparitions and that he  would be sure of it whenever he met such a thing he would know what it was made of before he parted with it  GOING out of the House in the Evening when it was almost dark but not quite he meets the Apparition in the Garden the Apparition shun'd him and would not have been seen or made as if it would not have been seen  H A  says he boldly  are you there What are you  The Apparition still makes from him and he speaks again  Who are you What is your Name  says he in a kind of jesting manner  My Business is not with you  says the Apparition But I have some Business with you  says he  I must know what you are and I will know what you are and with that  says my Story  tho' by the way I must tell you I don't know how true 'tis  I say  with that the bold Fellow offers to go up to it and lay Hands upon it at which it advanced to him and overrun him bore him down and threw him against the Garden Wall which was at least five or six Yards from him with such Violence that he was taken up for dead and I suppose he never ventur'd to lay Hands upon a Spirit or Apparition again  NOW be this Story true or not I mention it to warn rash Heads who pretending not to fear the  Devil  are for using the ordinary Violences with him which affect one Man from another or with an Apparition in which they may be sure to  eceive some Mischief I knew One fired a Gun at an Apparition and the Gun burst in a hundred Pieces in his Hand that is in a great many Pieces Another struck at an Apparition with a Sword and broke his Sword in Pieces and wounded his Hand gri  vously It is most certain that an Apparition or a Spirit is not to be cut with a Sword or shot with a Gun as there is no Substance there can be no Wound made and 'tis next to Madness for any one to go that way to work be it Angel or be it  Devil  BUT to carry this farther In particular an Apparition may shew itself and peform its Mission in a full and compleat manner and yet not speak I have a Story by me of a Gentleman who carried on a Secret and Criminal Conversation with a certain Lady and having made an Assignation to meet the Lady was met at the Place by an Apparition of his own Mother she said nothing she did not offer to speak nor did he at first know it to be an Apparition The Gentleman walks about in the Field near a House where he had appointed the Lady to meet the Apparition walk'd about likewise and he takes it to be a Woman in ordinary as any Woman might be seen to walk up and down in the same Field or Walk  BY and by the Woman or Lady appointed comes he meets her and goes forward to salute her the Apparition shows itself just behind the Lady and looks him full in the Face he starts back from the Lady and instead of kissing her  cries out  and asks her Who's that behind her she turns about but sees nobody nor he neither which frights them both  HE fancies it to be an imaginary Vapour having no Faith at all in Apparitions and offers to go up to the Lady again and behold he sees the Apparition just behind her again the Face standing just so as to look over the Lady's Shoulder and stare just upon him he cries out again and knows it to be his Mother who it seems was dead and in crying out again he adds  My Mother  at which it vanishes  HAD this Apparition any occasion to speak Was it not Rebuke enough to look him in the Face Even in common Affairs a Look from the Eye of one who has Authority to reprove is sometimes more effectual than the Reproof if it was given in Words at length  SUPPOSE this Spectre to regard him not with a threatning Aspect but with a Countenance of Pity of a Maternal Reprehension a Reproof urging Shame and Reproach like that of  Solomon What my Son what the Son of my Vows my Son be seen embracing a Strumpet  the Man went away says my Story fill'd with Confusion as no question indeed but he would  HERE was no need of Speech the Look was a Lash and a Reproof sufficient the Man would hardly meet there any more if he would meet the same Lady any more and 'tis very likely he never did  'TIS very unhappy in the Case before me that it is impossible to attest the Truth of all the Stories which are handed about upon such a Subject as this is and therefore tho' I might make Flourishes of the Truth of the Particulars in all Cases as others do I chuse rather to insist upon the Moral of every Story whatever the Fact may be and to inforce the Influence supposing the History to be real or whether it be really so or not which is not much material  ALL these Cases however return me back to the Advice above namely always if you see an Apparition  speak to it  speak to it early and answer any Questions it asks but be sure to ask it no Questions except such as are reasonable and may be supposed to be within the Reach of its imm  diate Capacity to answer no Questions tending to reveal the Mysteries of a future State To ask such Questions as are a plain diving into the Secrets of Heaven which it is already declared shall not be laid open is asking the good Spirit if it be such to offend on his Part and is really criminal on your Part as to ask what Condition the Person is in meaning the Person whose Shape the Apparition takes up How he gets Leave to appear here why he comes  in this or that Manner what kind of Place Heaven is and such like as the Bishop of  Down  and  Connor  ordered  James Haddock  to ask  BUT suit your Questions to what the Spectre shall say or as the manner of its Appearance shall direct you as particularly if it requires you to do any thing to speak to any Person or to deliver any Admonition to a third Person as in the case of the Apparition about the Duke of  Buckingham  and as in the Case of Dr  Scot  and others you may justly ask Tokens by which you may make your self be believed also such Questions as relate to yourself and to the Nature of the thing which the Apparition comes about  BUT Questions relating to things beyond Time curious Enquiries into Futurity and Eternity are upon many Accounts to be avoided and for some Reasons which I care not to mention in particular because I would not form frightful Ideas in the Minds of those that read I have some Stories by me which give an Account that upon such needless Inquiries the Apparition has turn'd itself into terrifying Appearances intimating Resentment not only a Resentment on its own Account but as if it was an Offence and a high Provocation to the supreme Power to offer to search into what Heaven has conceal'd To me indeed it seems it would be so and therefore 'tis certainly best to refrain those Inquiries  In a word the Apparition is as I may say Aggressor it appears you are passive be so still otherwise you make your self the Apparition and put the Apparition in your Place ask it wherefore it appears to you whether for Good or Evil if for Evil call upon God for Protection if it comes for Good declare your self ready to receive its Message and to observe every just Direction to obey every righteous Command and attend to what it shall say  THIS is to act fearless and yet cautious bold and yet wisely resolv'd and yet humble and in this Temper of Mind I think no Man need to be afraid of an Apparition  YOU may resolve all such things into this Whether they are good Spirits or bad Ang  lick Appearances or Diabolick they are under superior Limitations  the  Devil  we know is chain'd he can go no farther than the length of his Tether he has not a Hand to act or a Foot to walk or a Mouth to speak but as he is permitted The Case of his Commission to  Job  is explicit such and such things he might do such he might not even the Lives of  Job  's Children and Cattle and Servants were given him and like a  Devil  as he was he went to the full Extent of his Commission he spar'd not one of them that he could destroy but he was forbid to touch the Life of  Job  and he did not he durst not he could not kill him  IF then we are sure the  Devil  is restrained from hurting us any otherwise than he is directed and limited we may be sure that good Spirits are for their Nature their Business their Desires are all fix'd in a general Beneficence to Mankind their Powers and Employments as far as they are concerned among us and in things upon this Surface are included in the heavenly Acclamation when the Angels sung to the Shepherds  On Earth Peace Goodwill towards Men  Luk  ii  IF at any time they are Messengers of Judgment Executors of the divine Vengeance it is likewise by special nay by extraordinary Commission and then they are indeed Flames of Fire and punctually do what they are commanded and no more  BUT even then that we may be easie in the matter of Apparition they do not disguise themselves or conceal their Commission As  Manoah  's Wife said to him when the Angel appeared to her  if the LORD were pleased to kill us he would not have received a Burntoffering and a Meatoffering at our Hands neither would HE have shewed us all these things  Judges xiii So here the Apparition of a good Spirit would not betray us would not act by Stratagem with us would not appear in Peace when he means War come like a Friend when he was sent for an Enemy give good Council when he meant Death and Destruction But if it appears in Peace its Design and its Message is certainly  Peace  UPON the whole you have no way any Occasion to be disturbed at an Appearance but to regard the Power sending not the Agent sent looking beyond the Apparition itself and with a resolved Mind and a steddy calm Courage speak to it and demand its Business I do not mean by Demand a Demand of Insult and Arrogance but an humble yet resolved Enquiry Why and on what Occasion it comes to you  I HAVE done counselling If this Part is too grave for you as I said before it is not very tedious you may make it a Parenthesis and the Work will read without it for why should I desire you to do any good thing against your Will  IF you don't think there is any thing in it all if it is not worth your Notice go on without it and when you see any thing be not surpriz'd and confus'd cover'd with Horrour and Fright as is usually the Case of those who laugh loudest at such things before they come  WG  Esq famous for that particular Virtue called Impudence and for that more than ordinary Perfection of it which some People call Blasphemy how m  rry did he use to make himself about the ordinary Notions of seeing Apparitions and hearing People talk of Spirits and the  Devil  HOW witty would he be upon the poor Ladies when they seemed a little disordered at frightful Stories of People's walking and of the  Devil  's appearing in horrible Shapes and such like things as the old Women perhaps had weakly enough fill'd their Heads with Nothing pleased the young Hero like making a Jest of those things and the Truth was that many of them deserved it but the Jest of all Jests was to see the Esquire come home frighted out of more Wits than any one ever thought him Master of when riding home in the dark one Night he met that is his Fancy met the  Devil  in some monstrous Shape or other but such as his Terrors could not leave him room to describe only by two great Saucer Eyes glaring in the Dark and by puffing and blowing most frightfully It seems the  Devil  had been upon some hasty Business and was out of Breath  IN this Terror he is become such a Convert to the Doctrine of the Reality of Apparitions that he dares not be a Moment in the dark dares not lye alone or go up Stairs by himself When upon full Examination the  Devil  he met was only a hunted Bullock that some Butchers had made half mad and had pursued 'till they lost him in the Night and he passed the Esquire in the dark and was found the next Morning half dead near the Place where his Worship was scared with him Yet the Fright has got such Possession of his Soul that all the laughing at him and all the Fools and Childrens mocking him in the very Streets cannot bea  that Fit of trembling out of his Joints nor fortify his Soul against the Vision but of a Cat if it be in the dark  SO eminently silly does that needless Passion  Fear  bring us to be when it has once gotten Possession of the Mind How foolish how inconsistent are the Operations of it Hence really the Saying  to be  frighted out of our Wits  or Such a one is frighted out of his Wits is not so out of the way as some may imagine and the Esquire mention'd just now is as effectually so frighted out of his Wits even in the letter of it as is possible for nothing ever acted more like a Fool than he does now except it was himself when he made a Jest of the Reality of that very thing of which now he is so disorder'd with the Shadow  CHAP XIV Of Sham Apparitions and Apparitions which have been the Effect either of Fraud or Fear  BY sham Apparitions I am to be understood such as have been put upon People by the Fraud and Craft of subtle Knaves in order to bring about their wicked Designs or such as Fear and weak Apprehension have presented to and imposed upon the Imagination In short  FIRST  Apparitions with which People are cheated by others  SECONDLY  Apparitions with which they cheat themselves  FIRST  Apparitions form'd by the Knavery of others to cheat abuse and impose upon the Credulity of the People Such was the Fable of  Jupiter  descending in a Golden Shower and falling into the Lap of  Danaae  whom he had a mind to Debauch And indeed whose Virtue could we think would in those Days not to say a Word of our more modest and sanctified Ladies resist a shower of Gold falling into their Lap with a God in the middle of it too But that by the way  THE like Apparition that Immortal Ravisher of Virgins call'd  Jupiter  made when he stole the Lady  Europa  in the shape of a Milkwhite Bull inviting the Lady to get up upon his Back and immediately jumps into the Sea with her and swims over the  Hellespont  from whence the other side where she landed is call'd  Europe  to this Day Indeed when Ladies come to ride upon Bulls what can they expect Such was the horrid Cheat put upon that poor virtuous but bigotted  Roman  Lady persuading her that the Goddesir'd to enjoy her which she in blind Devotion submitted to with Raptures of divine Joy and Elevation caused her Bed to be laid in the Sacristie of the Temple deck'd it with Flowers and Perfumes and caused the debauch'd Priest to be dress'd up with Robes of State and offering rich Odours all the Night when at length instead of the God instead of the Apparition which she expected she was betray'd and was violated by the Traytor that lay in wait for her in the Temple Such again was the Apparition of  Apollo  which  Lucian  speaks of which was seen su  pended in the Air and carry'd or mov'd about from place to place in the Temple of  Apollo  at  Hierapolis Lucian de Dea Syra  SUCH was the sordid Imposture of  Mahomet  who having brought up a tame Pidgeon to come to his Ear where he fed her always with Pease or Tares so that she constantly came thither at his Call persuaded his Followers that it was an Apparition of the Angel  Gabriel  sent from GOD to whisper divine Oracles into his Soul and that he received the heavenly Inspirations by that means Such was the Voice which pronounc'd him to be the Prophet of the most high GOD which Voice sounding in the Air no Person appearing to speak was concluded to be the Voice of an Angel appearing to him whereas it was spoken by his own  Direction by a poor Fellow who he had placed on purpose at the bottom of a Well and when he found the Imposture take with the People he sent a Detachment of his Followers to fill up the Well with Stones pretending it was that it should no more be prophan'd by any Man or Cattle drinking of its holy Waters from whence the Voice of an Angel had been heard but really to bury the poor Wretch at the bottom of it that he might not betray the Secret and discover the contriv'd Delusion  SUCH likewise was the Story of the Ass that carry'd him up into Paradise and that not only to one but through seven or eight Paradises or Heavens where he saw two and thirty thousand Visions And such were all the Apparitions which that ridiculous Impostor feigned to see upon every Occasion 'till his blinded Followers believed him to be an Apparition himself  SUCH was the Image of St  George  rightly call'd Miraculous which the  Greeks  to this Day play horrible Pranks with at the Isle of  Skyros  in the  Archipelague  and which they put upon the People as an Apparition indeed exercising particular Severities upon People in several Cases But as it is manag'd by the Priests so 'tis especially very furious upon all those that neglect to fulfil the Vows made to the said Saint  George  or in general to all those that do not pay their Debts to the Clergy  MONSIEUR  Tournefort  in his Voyage into the  Levant  gives a diverting Account of the Conduct of this Devil of  Skyros  how they worry the Ignorant People to Death with it and impose upon them by it in the grossest and absurdest manner possible As there are not greater Impostors in the World than the  Greeks  and especially the  Greek  Clergy so there are not a more ignorant easilyimpos'dupon People in the World than the  Greek  Layety and especially those whom the  Greek  Clergy have to do with Hence it is that the most absurd Reasonings go down with them and indeed they may be truly said to be  Believers  in the literal sense for they take all things by the lump and without reasoning at all upon them if not it would be impossible to possess them as the Priests do with a Belie  that the Image of St  George  moves the Priest not the Priest the Image tho' he carries it about upon his Shoulders  YET this is the fact The Image of St  George  is no more than a Picture and that of very course Painting representing St  George  upon a log of Wood 'tis plac'd over the great Altar of the Cathedral at  Skyros  which is dedicated to that Saint when the Church is full of People the Image is seen to move of it self This they call and were the fact true it might well be call'd the Apparition of St  George  but be the Fact true or not 'tis believ'd to be so and that's as well to all the intents and purposes of an Apparition as if the Image were invigorated  BUT to speak it in their own words the Image is seen to move of it self and to show it self in Apparition to all the People for notwithstanding its Bulk and Weight it will transport it self through the Air into the midst of the Assembly there it hovers about as it were viewing every Face and examining every Heart if it finds any one that has fail'd to perform any Vow to him the Saint the Image immediately fixes it self on the Shoulders of the Delinquent singles him out and not only he is expos'd to the whole Assembly but the Image plies him with furious and continued Buffettings 'till he becomes penitent and promises again in the Face of the Assembly to pay what he owes to the Church  BUT this is not all but when the Assembly is thus purg'd by the Justice of this Ghost in an Image it is then taken up and plac'd upon the Shoulders of a blind Monk who carries it out of the Church into the Town the Monk being blind and not knowing whither he goes is guided by the occult impression of the Image who guides him as a Rider guides a blind Horse and thus he carries him directly to the House of such as are Delinquent in the case of Debt to the Altar of St  George  NOR is it enough that the Debtor seeing the Apparition or Image coming to him flies from it and escapes from House to House for the Image causes the Monk to follow him by the Foot as a Hound does a Hare so that in a word there's no escaping St  George  no flying from him the Monk is steddy in his pursuit ascends descends passes repasses enters all places 'till the poor Wretch who may be truly said to be hunted down or Hounded down as they express it in the North is oblig'd to pay the utmost Farthing  THIS Story fully confirm'd my thoughts in a Remark which I made from the beginning of this Work that really Church Apparitions are the most frightful most teizing and terrible in their way of all the real  Devils  that walk about in the World  BUT what need we wander thus among the Ancients and hunt among the  Greek  Schismaticks for artificial Apparitions and for Ecclesiastic Delusions of this kind The  Roman  Church that true Catholick Establishment built upon the solid Rock of St  Peter  himself how full is it of glorious Frauds of this kind and how has the whole Scheme of Papal Tyranny been supported among the People in this very manner ever since the great defection of the  Roman  Hierarchy from its true Primitive Purity and original holy Institution  NOT that I purpose to make this Work a Collection of Church Apparitions whether Popish or Protestant any more than I shall enter upon a reciting the  Universalia  of State Apparitions 'tis well for this Age both in Church and State that my Doctrine of the Rest of Souls is establish'd for certainly if the Souls of the Departed could be disturb'd either in Heaven or Hell by the mad things or the simple things the good things or the wicked things transacted by their Posterity in these Days there must be as great an Uneasiness in those eternal Mansions on account of the present Age as ever there was since History gives us any Account of things Never did any Generation make such Fools of their Fathers and such wise Men of themselves and both so unaccountable sure it must be that the Dead cannot come to the Quick and that they know nothing of us or the whole World would be one Apparition and we should as Sir  WB  said above have all come up again that was under Ground the dead World would be too many for the living World and we should meet ten Apparitions in every Street for one living Creature  BUT to come to the Case in hand the first Christian Apparition I meet with deserves our particular Remark first indeed because of the Importance of the Occasion namely for the Confirmation of the Faith of all true Catholicks in that great disputed yet unsettled Point  viz  Whether  ever St  PETER  was at  ROME  or no  a Point so essential and which the Hereticks take so much Pains to make doubtful that if we Catholicks do not establish it past all the Cavils of our Enemies we do nothing and for this we bring the miraculous Apparition of Jesus Christ to St  Peter  just without the City and which carried  Peter  back again into the City so that as he came out of  Rom    and return'd  to  Rome  Christ himself being Witness to it sure it can never be disputed any more  THIS being of so great Importance to the Catholick Church it is meet I should bring you good Authority for the Relation and therefore thinking my self not competent not a sufficient Evidence being perhaps suspected of Heresy I shall give it you out of the Labours of an ancient Father of the  Roman  Church and you shall have the Story from his own Mouth and in his own Words as follows It is the famous Doctor  Smith  a Popish Preacher in Queen  Mary  's Days who boasted that he had overcome both Bishop  Ridley  and Bishop  Latimer  in a Dispute against them about St  Peter  's having been at  Rome  Take a piece of the Reverend Doctor's Sermon  THE Doctor's Business was to take upon him to run down the poor oppress'd Confessors  Cranmer Ridley  and  Latimer  and make them odious to the People and being to preach a Sermon upon this Subject at  Whitti  gton  College in  London  the same or near it that is now call'd St  Martin Vintry  He begins thus  MY Masters you are in great E rror concern+ing the blessed Sacrament and all your Trust was in  Cranmer Ridley  and  Latimer  as for  Latimer  he said in  open Disputation  at  Oxford  that he had no Learning in that Matter but out of  Cranmer  's Book Before this I disputed with  Latimer  twenty Years ago and then he had no Learning As for  Cranmer  he said that his Learning came from  Ridley  and as for  Ridley  I disputed with him my self now at  Oxford  the other Day and I proved my Argument thus  Ille cui Christus obviavit Romae fuit Romae ac Christus obviavit Petro Romae Ergo Petrus fuit Romae  That is He whom  Christ  met at  Rome  was at  Rome  but  Christ  met  Peter  at  Rome  ERGO  Peter  was at  Rome  BY this Argument I prove two things and singular Mysteries of our Faith  FIRST That Peter was at Rome  against those who clatter that  Peter  never was at  Rome  SECONDLY  That if  Peter  met Christ bodily as  Abdias  reporteth and which I am sure is true or else such an ancient and holy Father would never have written it then consequently he may as well be in the Blessed Sacrament as he was met bodily To this  Ridley  stood like a Block and feeling himself convinc'  answer'd nothing Then said I  cur non respondes Haeretice Haereticorum Haereticissime  did I not handle him well  THEN he deny'd the Minor which I proved thus Christ met  Peter  going out of  Rome  and said  Goodmorrow Peter  whether goest thou  Peter  answer'd Goodmorrow  good Man  whither goest thou Then said  Christ  I go to  Rome  to suffer What saith  Peter  I trow unless I take my Marks amiss ye be JESUS CHRIST  Good Lord  how do you I am glad I have met you here Then said Jesus Christ to  Peter  Go back and suffer or else I must  pro te me  WHEN  Ridley  had heard this my Proof and  Abdias  's Authority a Doctor ancient and  rrefragable he answer'd never a word and thus I confuted  Ridley  in the Audience of a thousand and yet ye say that Jesus Christ was never bodily on Earth since his Ascension  HERE'S an Apparition of good Fame and of extraordinary Authority and if any Objection can lye against it 'tis only whether it be true or not but I am not to answer for that 'tis certainly true that the Learned Doctor preach'd this excellent Sermon and that's enough for me  BUT having thus given you an Apparition of such great Authority namely of Jesus Christ himself I shall quote you a few others of a more modern kind to confirm you in this Principle namely that Apparitions did not cease in the Church Tho' Miracles are said to cease and Prophesies cease tho' Oracles are dumb and the Dead do not return yet that Apparition is not wanting and the Artifices of the Fathers remain namely that they can show you wonders in Vision every Day for the Confirmation of that great Catholick Verity  I MIGHT descend here to the famous Apparition of  Loudon  commonly call'd the  Devil  of  Loudon  and the yet more famous Apparition of  Jetzer  at  Bern  in  Switzerland  These are indeed Orthodox Delusions and both carried on with the utmost Assurance I had almost said Villany by the Priests But I am not come so far down yet on our way to Modern Roguery  ONE of our Popes I think insisted that he had had an Apparition of the  Devil  to him whereas St  Francis  and St  Ignatius  each in their turn put the Bite of Apparition upon the World in so many particular cases that if they had not as we may say left it off in time as the World took them for mad Men and Fools they would have taken them for what they really were  viz  Knaves and Cheats and have used them accordingly and indeed it was once within an Ace with St  Francis  of his being whipt through the Streets at  Naples  for an Impostor and he had but one way to get off which was to add some things to his Conduct so extremely silly and ridiculous that he was taken for an Idiot and let run loose in the Streets with a crowd of Boys at his Heels following and shouting at him and throwing Dirt and rotten Eggs upon him This he turn'd into a species of Martyrdom valued himself upon it and would not suffer the Filth to  be s  raped off from him because it was the Ornament and Crown of his Sufferings for preaching the Gospel  IT was doubtful for some time whether this holy Enthusiast had more Apparitions of the  Blessed Virgin  or of the  Devil  following him It is true some of our Hereticks affirm'd he had no Apparitions at all either of the  Virgin  or of the  Devil  but that it was all a  devilish  Cheat which he had the Face to put upon the World But this they tell us is too uncharitable because 'tis supposing the Wretch himself who it is allow'd was a very weak and silly tho' an impudent Fellow was able to Impose upon all the World at that time who Universally believ'd that he had seen some Apparitions which elevated his Mind to that degree of Euthusiasm which he appear'd acted by  BUT then if we must allow he was visited with Apparitions it must be of the  Devil  not the  Blessed Virgin  because we have no Scripture Authority to support the Notion that she ever did or can appear at all either to him or any body else  and that all the pretended Apparitions of the Virgin  Mary  of what kind soever which the Legends are full of are the meer Impostures of the Priests as really and openly as if they had been seen to be perform'd Such was her speaking to St  Bernard  when he came up the Nave of the great Church at  Millan  at four steps twen  y Yards at a step at the first step he said  O Faelix  at the second step  O Pia  at the third step  O Santa  and at the fourth step  Maria  to which the Image answer'd  Salve Bernardi  The Marks of the four steps Dr  Burnet  in his Letters tells us are to be seen in the Church still cover'd with little Plates of Brass having the Words severally cut upon them and yet in spite of the Relique we cannot  for our Lives believe that the silent Image spoke to him any more than that he stept twenty Yards at a stride  UPON the whole we are at a Point with St  Francis  that if any Apparition did haunt him it was that of the  Devil  and they tell us this was so frequent that at last he pray'd to the  Virgin  that the  Devil  might not be allow'd to appear to him but upon extraordinary Occasions and that whenever he did he should have the better of the  Devil  if he contended with him after which the  Devil  never appear'd to him at all in his own Shape as it seems he used to do but always under some Disguise or in other Persons Shapes tempting him in those Apparitions as he found Occasion but that he was always too hard for him and drove him away Who had the Victory at last History is silent but some are apt to doubt that the  Devil  had the better of him then for that we do not read much of his Triumph over the  Devil  in  Articulo Mortis  ST  IGNATIUS  the Patron of the  Jesuits  pretended to make St  Francis  who was before him his Patron and to Mimick him in all his most ridiculous Extravagancies and these of Apparitions amongst the rest and his Life indeed is full of Histories of Apparitions either of one Saint or other or of the  Devil  or of the  Virgin  upon all Occasions and some of them the most trifling and frivolous in the World  ST  FRANCIS  being very melancholly earnestly desir'd to hear some Musick being told that Musick would exhilerate the Soul and immediately an Apparition of Angels surrounded him and making a Concert of most harmonious Musick play'd admirably for his Consolation for a very considerable while  ST  IGNATIUS  had like Apparitions of Angels playing sweet Lessons of heavenly Musick to him when he was writing his Book of Constitutions likewise af  er his Death a Concert of Angels made most excellent Musick at his Grave and several Stars were seen plac'd upon his Sepulchre  N B  The first Stars that were ever seen in Apparition upon Earth nor indeed did I ever hear that the Stars walk'd before  SOME Apparitions have been form'd by the Policy or rather the meer Face of the Priests to prove their absurd Doctrines  Surius  a zealous Writer for Invocation of Saints says that  whatever  Hereticks  may prate  he should have said whatever the Scripture may prate  it is abundantly prov'  that the departed Saints know our Concerns on Earth and hear our Petitions  and so he determines the Question in Controversy  viz  Invocation of Saints  Surius Not ad Bonavent in Vit St Francisci  HE does not indeed offer any thing to prove the Fact but several miraculous Apparitions of the  Blessed Virgin  to the devout Priests praying to her one of which may be as true as the other  TO prove the Possibility of a Person being in two Places at once we are assur'd of the following Apparition of St  Ignatius  LEONARD KESEL  a Jesuit of  Cologne  passionately desir'd to see this extraordinary Person of whom he had heard such wonderful Things related and whose Fame spread far and wide for a most wonderful Man  Kesel  an honest wellmeaning Man knowing very well the best way to see a Man was to be brought to the Place where he was and having no Notion of his being a Worker of Impossibilities tho' he thought him a strange Person too yet I say not dreaming of Miracles  he writes to  Ignatius  what a desire he had to see him and begs his Leave for  Kesel  being a Priest of his Order he could not stir without License I say begs his Leave to come to  Rome  to receive his Blessing  IGNATIUS  forbids him positively assuring him that if such an Enterview was necessary GOD would provide a way for it without giving him the trouble of so long a Journey  KESEL  did not understand the meaning of the Answer and was extreamly dissatisfy'd to be so far under the Displeasure of his Superior as to be deny'd coming to see him which he so passionately desir'd however he was oblig'd to submit and waited the Event  UPON a Day says the Story when he least thought of it behold  Ignatius  comes up into his Cell or Chamber and having talk'd with him a very considerable while suddenly disappear'd leaving the Jesuit exceedingly comforted with such a prodigious wonderful Visit  ST  FRANCIS  did these things frequently it seems and rid thro' the Air in a fiery Chariot which I dare say is as true as that St  Dunstan  while he was a Boy flew down from the top of  Glastenbury Tor  or  Tower  a Place well known in  Somersetshire  THE Conversion of St  Ignatius  they tell us was brought to pass by an Apparition of St  Peter  to him who came and touch'd his Wounds receiv'd in Battle and healed them immediately and yet it seems as if St  Peter  was but a lame Doctor for that St  Ignatius  halted and that his Leg was crooked as long as he liv'd cannot be deny'd whereas when St  Peter  healed the impotent Man at  Jerusalem  the Text says he made him  every whit whole Acts  iii  ST  FRANCIS  is said to have done innumerable Cures for sick and diseased Persons by appearing to them after his Death and I could fill a Volume with the History of them but it seems to be needless all true Catholicks acknowledge it  PASCALL Ignatius  's ChamberFellow and Companion being reduced to great Necessities after his Death implores the Assistance of his Collegue in the Church of St  Laurence  or some other Church at  Rome  immediately he heard a melodious Sound and saw  Ignatius  appearing to him attended with a numerous and beautiful Train of the Servants of God but what Relief the Apparition gave him in his extream Necessity  this Deponent saith not  BUT I may close the Discourse of impos'd Apparitions with that memorable Story of  Jetzer  a  Dominican  in the Monastry or House of  Dominicans  at  Bern  in  Swisserland  The Forgery is manifest and the Reason of it 'twas an Imposition upon the  Franciscans  and contriv'd to carry on the Contention which was between the two Societies to a compleat Victory  THE  Franciscans  insist upon the  Blessed Virgin  's being Immaculate and born without original Sin sanctify'd from the Womb and therefore they cannonize Blessed St  Ann  who was the  Virgin  's Mother and make her a triumphant Saint almost as glorious as her Daughter and have a Service for her call'd  the Prerogatives of St  Ann  Mother of the Mother of God  wherein they declare she conceiv'd the  Blessed Virgin  without the Knowledge of a Man and that it was upon an Apparition of two Angels to her which she relates to her Husband  Joachim  There's an Apparition too for the Confirmation of the  Franciscans  That's by the way  THE  Dominicans  on the other hand deny that the  Virgin  is Immaculate they allow that she is conceiv'd in Sin but that she continu'd under the  Culpa  or  Defilement  but three Days and they bring in an Apparition of the  Blessed Virgin  to this Friar  Jetzer  lamenting to him that they should go about to make her equal to her Son in Holiness and confessing in the Words of the Text that she was  shapen in Iniquity Psal  li  SO here is one Miracle to confute another and perhaps both alike authentick  BUT the Story of  Jetzer  is full of Miracles all contriv'd by the Prior and three of the Fathers first the Apparition of a Soul in Purgatory comes to  Jetzer  with a Box near his Mouth so contriv'd that when he breath'd upon it it appear'd to be all Fire coming out of his Mouth he had also three Dogs hanging upon him and gnawing him as his Tormentors  IN this Posture he comes to the poor Friar  Jetzer  in the dark and when he was in his Bed tells him his deplorable Condition but that he might be taken out of Purgatory by his Means and by his Mortifications and this Story he backs with most horrible Groans as in the utmost Misery by his Sufferings  N B  You are to understand that this Friar  Jetzer  was a Fellow pick'd out to make a proper Tool for these Impostures being very silly and very devout and had they not overacted the thing the Design might have gone a great way  IN Consequence of the first Apparition they made the poor Friar undergo severe Discipline Whipping and Mortifications and then the Apparition came and thank'd him and told him he was deliver'd out of Purgatory by his Means so that  Part ended to the infinite Satisfaction of the poor macerated Friar  THE next was the Apparition of the same Person but in the Habit of a  Nun  representing St  Barbara  and all in Glory telling him  at the blessed Virgin was so delighted with his Zeal and Devotion that she would visit him the next Day in Person and give him her Benediction for Consolation in his Sufferings and Mortifications at which the Fool the Friar I mean was ravished with Joy and prepar'd himself and the whole Conv  nt to receive her  AT the appointed time the expected Delusion appeared The blessed Virgin clothed with the utmost Magnificence dress'd up with Jewels as she used to be on Occasion of the most sol  mn Festivals attended by Angels which were seen to be flying about her as her Pages  N B  They were the little carv'd Angels which were placed in the Church upon extraordinary Days and now placed as Machines about the Apparition and lifted up in the Air with Pullies fasten'd in the Room above  IN this Equipage the Lady Queen of Heaven Mother of God was brought in Apparition to her poor mortify'd and humble Servant she carest him with high Expressions of Affection to him extolling the Merit of his Charity in suffering such S  verities for the meer Love of delivering a poor tormented Soul out of Purgatory own'd to him that she was conceived in original Sin and told him Pope  Julius  who then held the Chair should put a final End to all those Disputes and should abolish the Feast of her Conception After much more to the same purpose she promised him a Mission to go to the holy Father in her Name to assure him of the Truth of the Vision and that it was her Pleasure it should be so and in Confirmation of it  all she gave him three Drops of Blood which she told him were the Tears Christ shed when he wept over  Jerusalem  with abundance of such like  HERE was a true sham Apparition now form'd to establish a particular Sect or Society and a particular Profession concerning the immaculate Conception here could the impatient Friars have set Bounds to their Revenge they had had a compleat Victory over the  Franciscans  Nay had St  Francis  himself come up in Apparition on the other side it would not have balanc'd the Cheat for all the World began to give Credit to the Apparition  BUT the Priests knew no Bounds nothing would serve them but new Apparitions to the Friar and new Mortifications to the  Franciscans  'till in short  J  tzer  himself as foolish and simple as he was saw through it detected the Cheat and escaping out of the Monastery discover'd it all to the Magistrates having twice escaped being poison'd by them so the whole Fraud ended at the Gallows or rather at the Stake for the four Friars were condemned to be burnt and were executed accordingly  THE History of the Discovery is not to my Purpose it may be seen in many Authors as also the Tryal Sentence and Execution of the Criminals at  Bern May  where they were all burnt together But this Part is effectually to my Purpose  viz  that there has been and I doubt not still is a great deal of sham Apparition impos'd upon the World by the Delusions of others and as it lies chiefly among the Clergy where must we look for it but where it is to be found  NOR are the Pagan Clergy free from the same vile Practices namely to forge Apparitions to confirm their Delusions and the History of all Countries are full of Accounts of it too many to repeat here  THE Possessions and Exorcisms in the dismal Story of the  Devils  of  Loudon  are full of Apparitions and Visions by which the wretched Fraud was carried on and by which so much Villany was practis'd as is almost without Example a Story which has already fill'd a Book and is extant in many Languages a Fraud not outdone by the Brachmans and Priests of the  Pagans  in  China  or in  Japan  I MIGHT next entertain you with sham Apparitions put in Practice by the  Devil  himself in those Countries where he has made himself be worshipped as a God and where he supports all the Devilworship by Apparition showing himself now one way now another as he finds it for his Purpose appearing one Day in Fire and Flame at another time in Storm and Tempest at a third time in Humane and Familiar Shape and in all the End is to keep up the Dread of his Person in the Minds of his Worshippers and to preserve a Reverence to his Institutions whatever they are  IF we may believe our Writers of Travels and Observers of Things the  Devil  not only assumes Humane Shape but insinuates himself in the real Person of a  Devil  to the Women and so possesses them to say no more of it as to commit horrid nameless Wickednesses with them such as are not to be suggested without Horror In other Places the Apparition of the  Devil  is the Fund of all their religious Worship and he has Altars erected and Sacrifices nay which is worse Human Sacrifices offered to him  IN these horrid Performances he appears in terrible Shapes and the poor Natives are so frighted at him that the Fear only excites the Homage which they pay to him and secures to him an entire Sovereignty for Fear may for ought I know be the Characteristick of a Pagan Worship as Love is that of a Christian  THE Great Temple of  Montezuma  at  Mexico  was little else but a horrible Butchery of Humane Carcasses the Blood of which lay sprinkled or dash'd against the Walls 'till it lay there hardened and congeal'd if Report may be believ'd above a Foot thick and that they sacrifiz'd at least twentythousand People a Year in that one Pagode or Temple  THE  Indians  confess'd that they had frequent Apparitions among them of the Spiritis which they called by several Names and that the Great Spirit that is the  Devil  also appeared to them upon their Great Festivals in bright and extraordinary Apparition to approve and accept of their Worship and Homage and no doubt of their Sacrifices too  IN  Cochin China  we are told the  Devil  goes farther for he not only shows himself in Apparition but he utters lying Oracles even himself in his proper Person and also whispers such Answers to the Priests as serve to keep up a Decorum in their Worship and a secret Reverence to his Person And Father  Borri  says the  Devil  walks about there so frequently and so familiarly in Humane Shapes that they are not at all disturb'd at him  AT other times as the same Author affirms they associate themselves with particular Persons upon various Occasions and especially with the Women as abov  so that in short in some Cities which are very populous it would be something hard to distinguish between the real People and the Apparitions How far if it were examin'd into it would not be the like among us I won't pretend to say  WHO knows in our Throngs of divided Christians whether he meets with a Saint or an Apparition whether he talks with a Counsellor or a  Devil  and the art of discerning would indeed be well  worth having indeed it would be worth buying if Money would purchase it The  Devil  's Disguises are very many and Apparition is one of the best of them because he can soon change Shapes and change Postures which in other Cases he may find less advantageous to his Interest Nor is it easy for Mankind to come to the Certainty even when he sees an Apparition whether it be a Good or an Evil Appearance and the best way of finding it out except that of judging by the Errand he comes on and which I have mention'd already is to ask it the Question directly if it equivocates and shuffles conclude 'tis the  Devil  for he is a Sharper and a Dissembler from the Beginning if 'tis a good Spirit it will answer you directly and honestly and tell you its Business at once and this is what I mean where I say SPEAK TO IT  IF you find it is a good Spirit hearken to it if the  Devil  defie it and whether it be a good or evil Spirit  fear it not  for both are under the special Direction and Authority of him that made the World and will govern it in whose Hands you are and 'tis well it is so For as Good is above Evil so God is above the Devil Tell him so and bid him Defiance and if you can but do it with a good Heart he's gone depend upon it he'll never stand you  Probatum est  But I must leave off the religious Cheats for they are endless 'tis time to talk of Apparitions of another nature less serious and less tiresome to hear of  CHAP XV Of Imaginary Apparitions the Apparitions of Fancy Vapours waking Dreams delirious Heads and the Hyppo  AS the  Devil  is not so Black as he is Painted so neither does he appear in so many Shapes as we make for him we Dress him up in more Suits of Cloaths and more Masquerade Habits than ever he wore and I question much if he was to see the Pictures and Figures which we call  Devil  whether he would know himself by some of them or no  IT would require more Skill than I doubt I am Master of to bring you all to a right Method of thinking upon this Subject however I shall venture upon it by way of Essay that you may form such Images of the  old Gentleman  in your Mind that you may not be cheated about him may know him when you see him may not call him out of his Name or bestow his Right Worshipful Titles upon another  IT is observable that tho' most People in all Parts of the World allow there is such a thing as a  Devil  an evil Spirit an ArchEnemy of Mankind and they are pretty near one another in their several Notions of him for even those Savages that worship him acknowledge they do so only that he may not hurt them yet they differ exceedingly in their Ideas of his Person and that almost every where and accordingly it follows that they must differ in their Representations and Pictures of him  SOME Paint him one way some another and yet I observe that so little good Will they have for him any where that they all Picture him as ugly as monstrous and as deform'd as they can  I HAVE heard of some Pagans who worship a black Cloud for the  Devil  because it often speaks in Noises and breathes out Fire I cannot say but worshipping the Sun for a  God  and the Thunder and Lightening for a  Devil  seems to me to have more Sense in it than many of the other Branches of Idolatry in the World the one being the most natural resemblance of the greatest Good and the other of the greatest Evil in the World  SOME I am told resemble or represent the  Devil  by a vast great Globe of Wood carv'd or cut all over into Mouths describ'd in a thousand different Distortions gaping grining and voracious Figures all intimating a greedy unquenchable Thirst or Appetite to devour and destroy rolling itself continually about so that some of its thousand of Mouths being undermost are always gaping and biting and taking in something but ever unsatisfy'd the rest of 'em gaping still for more If this hideous Representation is not just to his Form I think verily it is just to his Nature and is very Emblematick the Thoughts it gives Birth to in our Fancy may not be so remote as are form'd by those simple Comick and yet wou'dbefrightful Draughts we draw of him with a Cock's Bill Ass's Ears Goat's Horns glaring Eyes Batts Wings cloven Foot and Dragon's Tail not one of which except the last having either Antiquity or Authority for them that I know of  IT'S true he is describ'd in the  Apoc a lypse  as a great red Dragon and in another Place as a Beast but neither of them give us any true Idea of his real Form  NOW if we do not know his Figure how shall we know him in Apparition for if we know nothing of his real Shape how shall we judge of him in his Disguise How shall we single him out upon Occasion Suppose we were to look for him at a Masquerade For my Part I cannot deny but I might mistake him and pitch upon a Priest or a Turk a Tinker or a Tarpaulin and say this is the  Devil  or that is the  Devil  as soon as the real  Hydrapater  himself and let him pass perhaps for a  Nobody  worth taking Notice of  AS then  I say  we have such unguided Notions of him and know him so little in any of his uncouth Figures and Disguises 'tis not so much wonder that we mistake every ugly misshapen monstrous Thing and call it by his venerable Name  HOW often has poor unhappy shapeless  Z    M  been started at even in the open Day nay in the very Sunshine Bless me says a fine Lady in the  Mall  one Day as she pass'd him sure that's the  Devil  Why Sister says she to the Lady that was next her did not you see it I'll be gone I am frighted out of my Wits Why if I should meet it again I shall sink into the Ground I'm sorry I did not see him says the Sister for I want mightily to see the  Devil  but I was happily better employ'd for just that Moment Sir  G    D  that Glory of Heroes the brightest of Men went by me my Soul flew along with him dear Sister 'tis hardly come back yet  O YOU'RE happy Sister you saw a Heavenly I an Infernal you an  ArchAngel  I the  Devil  let me go Sister for I am undone if I see him again if I were with Child I should bring forth a Monster  HE had not gone twenty Yards farther but a Knot of Ladies met him it seems they were  Roman  Catholicks  and they all cross'd themselves and look'd up to Heaven said every one of them an  Ave  and a  Pater  and went on as fast as they could  A LADY big with Child had the Misfortune to be next who was so frighted she fell into Fits went home and Miscarried and lastly which was more unhappy just as he stept out of the  Mall  at the turning to St  James  's he almost jostled another Lady that was nearer her Time and she immediately call'd for a Chair was carried away fell into Travel and died in Childbed  AND yet this Piece of Deformity this Scare  Devil Z    M  is an honest goodhumour'd Fellow as lives and I happen'd to see him soon after  WHAT have you done  Zach said I  was you in the Park to Day  YES I was  says he  Why what's the Matter have any of the Ladies fallen in Love with me  YES yes  says I  you put the whole  Mall  in an Uproar  I THOUGHT so  says he  I knew I should have Admirers as well as other Beaus Why not pray but let 'em die I am Inexorable  BUT do you know what Mischief you have done  said I in Earnest  NOT I  says he  but I suppose I may have frighted somebody or other with my  Devil  's  Face  and what then how can I help it If they don't like me they may look off o' me  WHY no  says I  it seems they can't  NO no Beauty is attractive you know and so is Deformity  says he  if you meet a  Will with a Wisp  you can't look off of it They will look at me they can't help it and they look so long you see that I fright every now and then one or two of them into Love with me  HARD Fate of the Sex  said I Zach  that Men should be so scarce they must be in Love with the  Devil  I am persuaded many of them take you for an Apparition  THAT'S a Sign of horrid Ignorance  says he merrily  why he is not half so ugly as I am 'Tis a sign they don't know him I tell you the  Devil  's a comely Fellow  to me Jack  THOU art an ugly Dog that's true  said I  but thou art the besthumour'd goodestnatur'd Creature alive  said I  upon my Word I'd be  Z    M  though I frighted all the Ladies in the Park to have half the Wit and Sense and good Humour that is cover'd with so much Deformity  AND I'd be any thing but two  says he  to be but just tolerable to Mankind and not fright the Horse I ride on  BUT two What two pray  said I  Are there two Things you wou'd not change for  YES  says Z  I wou'd not be a  Fool  or a  Beggar  but especially not the first  NOW what is the Case of this unhappy Gentleman 'tis quite the Reverse of what the Ladies take him for one says he is the  Devil  and another says 'tis the  Devil  and another that 'tis an Apparition and the last is true But of what not of the  Devil  I assure you Apparitions they say generally assume a different Likeness the  Devil  never Masques in Deformity an Angel may the  Devil  often puts on the  Beau  and the  Beauty  he is today a smart young rattling Fop tomorrow a Smirk a Spruce a Harlequin today he is a devout Lady at Prayers tomorrow a Coquet a Masquer at the Ball but 'tis all fine and clever he very rarely puts on Ugliness for that wou'd be no Disguise to him  ON the contrary when a bright Seraph dresses in Form it takes up the Extreme of its Contrary and a Divine and exalted Soul may put on the Habit of an unsightly Carcass to appear in the World in a more compleat Masquerade and thus it was with my Friend  Zach Ma  his Outside was indeed a Masquerade to him he was perfectly the Reverse of what he appear'd and he had the brightest and sublimest Soul that was ever wrapt up in Flesh and Blood in the Posture or Habit of something uglyer to look on than the  Devil  IN a word he was a  Devil  to the Imagination for every body thought of the  Devil  when they saw him went home and told their Maids and their Children they had seen the  Devil  and told it over so often 'till they believ'd it themselves and so made a real Apparition of him as it were by the mere force of his extraordinary Countenance  YET the honest Gentleman had no Horns on his Head no Cock's Bill or a cloven Foot I assure you but was meer  Zach M  as merry and as goodhumour'd a Creature as ever liv'd full of Wit Master of Learning Temper and a thousand good Qualities without one bad one nothing amiss in him or about him but his Outside and as to that nothing so frightful in the three Kingdoms  NOW if meeting poor mortify'd merry  Zach M  shou'd raise the Vapours among us and from a little Jesting at first fright the poor Ladies into Miscarriage Travel and the Grave make them go home and say in Jest they had seen the  Devil  'till they believ'd it in Earnest what will not the like ungovernable Fancy and Power of a frighted Imagination prevail upon us to think or say  A SOBER grave Gentleman who mu  not wear a Name in our Story because it was rather a Distemper  in his Mind than a real Deficiency of Brains had by a long Disuse of the sprightly Part of his Sense which he really had no want of at other times suffer'd himself to sink a little too low in his Spirits and let the  Hypochondria  emit too strongly in Vapour and Fumes up into his Head This had its Fits and its Intervals sometimes he was clearsighted and clearheaded but at other times he saw Stars at Noonday and  Devils  at Night In a word the World was an Apparition to his Imagination when the  Flatus  prevail'd and the Spleen boil'd up of all which he could give no account nor could he assist the Operation of Physick by any of his own Powers towards a Cure  IT happen'd that he was abroad at a Friend's House later than ordinary one Night but being Moonlight and a Servant with him he was easy and was observed to be very chearful and even  Merry  with a great deal of good Humour more than had been observed of him for a great while before  HE knew his Way perfectly well for it was within three Miles of the Town where he liv'd and he was very well mounted but tho' the Moon was up an Accident which a little disorder'd him was that it was not only cloudy but a very thick black Cloud came suddenly that is to say without his Notice so it was suddenly to him and spread over his Head which made it very dark and to add to the Disorder it began to rain violently  UPON this being very well mounted as I have said he resolved to ride for it having not above two Miles to the Town so clapping Spurs to his Horse he gallop'd away His Man whose Name was  Gervais  not being so well mounted was a good way behind The Darkness and the Rain together put him a little out of Humour but as that  was a little unexpected perhaps it made him ride the harder rather than abated his Pace  IN the Way there was a small River but there was a good Bridge over it well walled on both sides so that there was no Danger there more than any where else But the Gentleman kept on his speed to go over the Bridge when being rather more than half over his Horse stopt on a sudden and refused as we call it bearing off to the right hand he saw nothing at first and was not much discompos'd at it but spurr'd his Horse to go forward the Horse went two or three Steps then stopt again snorted and stared and then offer'd to turn short back then the Gentleman looking forward to see what was the matter and if he could observe what the Horse was scared at saw two broad st  ring Eyes which as he said look'd him full in the Face  THEN he was heartily frighted indeed but by this time he heard his Man  G  rvais  coming up When  Gervais  came near the first thing he heard his Master say was  Bless me it is the Devil  at which  Gervais  a lowspirited Fellow was as much frighted as his Master However his Master a little encou  aged to hear his Man so near him press'd his Horse once more and call'd aloud to  Gervais  to come but he as I said being frighted too made no haste at length with much ado his Master spurring his Horse again got over the Bridge and passed by the Creature with broad Eyes which the Light a little encreasing he affirm'd positively when he was pass'd was a great black BEAR and consequently must be the  Devil  THO'  Gervais  was near enough yet fearing his Master would set him to go before he kept as far off as he could When his Master call'd he answer'd indeed but did not come on at least did not make much haste but seeing his Master was gone past and that he himself was then obliged to follow  he went on softly and when he came to the Bridge he saw what it was his Master's Horse snorted at and refused to go on of which you shall hear more presently  HIS Master's Horse being got past the Difficulty needed no Spurs but as frighted Horses will flew away like the Wind and the Rain continuing his Master who on many Accounts was willing to be at home let him go so that he was at home and got into the House long before his Man  Jervais  could get up with him  THE Master as soon as he came into the Light swoon'd away and the Fright had had such an effect upon him that when with much Difficulty they had brought him to himself he continued very ill and when his Lady and a Sister he had in the House with him as much overrun with the  Hyppo  as himself came to enquire what had happened to him he told them a formal Story that at such a Bridge he met the  Devil  that he placed himself just at the coming off from the Bridge on his left hand at the Corner of the Wall that he stood and stared in his Face and that he could distinctly perceive it was the  Devil  in the Shape of a  Bear  He gave other Descriptions so punctual and particular that there was no room to doubt but it was an Apparition and that it was in the Shape of a great Bear  GERVAIS  came home soon after and going into the Stable directly as was his Business to take care of his Master's Horse as well as his own there he told the Story his Way among the other Servants and especially two or three Grooms and Servants belonging to Gentlemen that were Neighbours and he tells them that his Master was in great danger of being thrown over the Wall of the Bridge for that his Horse was frighted at an Ass which stood just at the Corner of the Wall and it was my  Fault indeed says  Gervais  for it was a young Horse and I had never told my Master but it was a Trick he had got that he could not abide an Ass and would by no means come near one if he could help it  AND are you sure 'twas an Ass  Gervais  s  ys the other Servants staring at one another as if they were frighted Are you sure of it Yes says  Gervais  for as soon as my Master got by it I rid up to it and thresh'd it with my Stick and it fell a braying which you know says  Gervais  is a base ugly Noise and so I came away and le  t it  WHY  Gervais  says they your Master believes it was the  Devil  as really as if he had spoken to it  I'M sorry my Master should be so frighted says  Jervais  but I am very sure it was nothing but an  Ass  But the Story had gotten Vent and the first Part of it flew all over the Town that Mrhad seen the  Devil  and was almost frighted to Death  THEN came his Man  Jarvis  's Tale and made it appear that Mr's strange and wonderful Apparition was dwindled into an Ass and that the  Devil  he had seen in the Shape of a Bear was no more than a poor  Boricco  as the  Italians  call him this made his Master be laught at sufficiently  HOWEVER poor  Jarvis  or  Gervais  was  ain to turn out and lost his Place for it and the wise Mrto this Day insists upon it that 'twas the  Devil  and he knew him by his broad Eyes tho' 'tis known that a Bear has very little Eyes but 'tis impossible to perswade any Vapourish Body that they have not seen the  Devil  if they have but seen something and that they are very sure they are not sure what it is  I REMEMBER a Delusion almost as gross the Memory of which I believe remains for a Truth to this day Not far off of the Town of  Darking  in  Surrey  the People or some People rather entertained  a Notion from the following Passage that a Ghost walk'd in such a Place that she for it was an antient Lady lately dead was seen hovering about the Mansionhouse which was left uninhabited for some time that she would be up and down in the House very often in the Daytime making a rumbling and a clattering Noise and in the Nighttime she walk'd in the neighbouring Fields with a C  ndle in her Hand and that tho' the Wind blew ever so hard it would not blow the Candle out that sometimes she would appear in the open Field sometimes up in the Trees and particularly there was a little Heath near  Darking  called the  Cottman D  an  where it was said she was frequently seen  THERE was a Boardingschool of Boys in that Town where there was in particular some roguish  London  Boys who contrived all this Walking from the Beginning to the End First they got a small Rope and tying one end of it to an old Chair which stood in an upper Room of the H  se for they had found means to get in and out of the House at pleasure they brought the other end of the Rope down on the Outside of the House in a private Place where it could not easily be seen and by this they pulled the old Chair up and then let it fall down again and made a great Noise in the House so as it might be easily heard by the Neighbours then other Boys of the same Gang took care to call out to the old Women in the next Houses that now they might hear the old Lady a playing her Pranks and accordingly they would all a  semble in the Courtyard where they could plainly hear it but not one would venture to go up Stairs If any offered to go up a little way then all was quiet again but as soon as ever they retired the rumbling would begin again This was for the Day  IN the Night one of these unlucky Boys had gotten a dark Lanthorn which was a thing the Country People did not understand and with this he walk'd all about the Orchard and two or three Closes near the House sometimes shewing the Light on this side and then his Comrades calling all the old Women about 'em to see it on a sudden the Light would go out the Boy closing up the Lanthorn and then he would run swiftly cross the whole Field and shew his Light again on the other side Now he would be up in a Tree then in the Road then upon the middle of the Heath so that the Country People made no more Question but that the old Lady walk'd with a Candle in her Hand than that they saw the Light of it and in a word it pass'd for an Apparition as certainly as we on the other hand knew what Knavery agitated it all  IT must be con  ess'd that a dark Lanthorn join'd with an Enthusiastick Head might prevail to make such a Sham take with weak and bigotted People and they were mighty willing to say beforehand that they were sure something walk'd  WHEN they heard the Chair tumble about in the Chamber tho' pulled by a String and no body near it no nor in the whole House the People who came together in the Courtyard fancy'd often the saw Heads of People moving up and down the Room where the Noise was and one said positively she saw a white Headdress  BUT to realize the Delusion one cry'd out There's the Spirit there's the Ghost just at such a Place of the Window and affirm'd it stood close to the Glass and describ'd it another as Moonblind as her self  says  Ay so it does and points peremptorily to the Place declaring that she sees it plainly and thus they run away with it all together that the Ghost walks and the House is haunted and for a long time it is believ'd no other when here  was nothing but the mean Contrivance of a few Boys  THE Notion of Spirits appearing to discover where Money has been buried to direct People to dig for it has so universally prevail'd with Womankind I might say and even with Mankind too that it is impossible to beat it out of their Heads and if they should see any thing which they call an Apparition they would to this Day follow it in hope to hear it give a Stamp on the Ground as with its Foot and then vanish and did it really do so they would not fail to dig  to the Center  if they were able in hopes of finding a Pot of Money hid there or some old U  n with Ashes and  Roman  Medals in short or some considerable Treasure  A COUNTRY Gentleman had an oldbuilt House which was the Remains of an old Demolished Monastery or Religious House and he resolved to have it pull'd down but thought the Charge too much to bestow so he bethought himself of a Stratagem which was to give it out that the House was haunted and this he did so artificially that it began to be currently believed for he made a Fellow dress himself up in White and pass swiftly cross the inner Court of the House just at a time when he had appointed others to be at the Window to see it  THEY gave Notice to the House that there was an Apparition then the Master and Mistress and all the Family were called up to the Window where tho' it was so dark that they could not distinguish what he was yet they plainly saw the thing in white go cross the Yard and in at a Door of the old Building soon after it was in they perceiv'd a Flash of Fire in the House which was contriv'd that the Fellow should make with some Brimstone and other Materials on purpose so that it should leave a Stench of Sulphur behind it but not be just the Smell of Gunpowder  AS he expected it began to work some fanciful People having notice of it and being desirous to see the same Apparition had the occasion offer'd them and saw it in its usual manner of showing it self its frequent walking was ordinary at one part of the House where the Spirit had an opportunity to slip out at a Door into another Yard and so into the dwelling House and when it went off that way it gave a great stamp with its Foot and immediately it was gone  UPON this it was presently said there was Money hid and the Gentleman gave it out that he would dig there for it and mighty eager People were to have it done however the Gentleman seem'd to cool in the matter still the Apparition was seen to come and go walk to and again almost every Night and ordinarily it vanish'd in a flash of Fire as above which in a word was very extraordinary  AT length some of the Towns People in the Village adjoyning finding the Gentleman began to slight or neglect it gave out that if Esquirewould give them leave they would dig for that certainly Money was hid there nay if he would consent they should have it if they found it they would dig for it and find it too tho' they digg'd the whole House down  THE Gentleman reply'd that was not fair for them to pull his House down and have all they found too that was too hard but he would consent to this That provided they would carry away all the Rubbish and all the Materials which they dug down and pile up the Bricks and Timber in the Yard near the House and would be content with half they found he would give them leave to dig  WELL they consented and to work they went the Spirit or Apparition which appear'd at  first seem'd to point out the Place and the first thing they took down was a great stack of Chimnies and a heavy piece of work it was but the Gentleman willing to encourage them secretly hid seven and twenty Pieces of old Gold in a hole in the Chimney which had no entrance into it but by one passage which he Brick'd up  WHEN they came to this Money they were perfectly deluded and out of their Wits the Gentleman happen'd to be near but not just upon the Spot when it was found and he being call'd very  rankly gave it them all but upon Condition they should not expect the like if they found any more  IN a word this Bite made the Country Fellows work like Horses and more came into the knot but that which encourag'd them farther was they did really find several things of Value in the pulling down the House which perhaps had lain hid from the time of Demolishing it as a religious House and some Money was found too but continual expectation and hope of finding more so animated the Fellows that in short they pull'd the whole House down nay I might say they pull'd it up by the Roots for they dug up the very Foundations which was what the Gentleman desir'd and would have given a great deal of Money to have had done  NOR did they leave the House in a heap of Rubbish but according to his Agreement with them they carried the Materials away and set up the Timber and old Bricks in an adjacent Yard as he directed them and in good order too  SO violent was the Persuasion that upon this fancy'd Apparition walking in the House Money was hid there that nothing could stop the eagerness of the Country People in working as if the Souls of the old Nuns or Friars or whatever they were who had hid any Treasure there supposing any was hid could no  be at Rest as was said in  other Cases or could be any way concern'd for the finding it so many Years afterward being almost two hundred Years  IF they could suppose any thing so weak where must they suppose those Departed Souls or Ghosts could have been during all that time and why did they not appear before what had all the Ages between done to be so much less in their Favour that they did not come to discover this Money to them but that the Deposit should remain un  r Ground so long without any enquiry after t 'till this Age not at all more worthy than their Ancestors should be inform'd of it  THERE is not a thing in Nature so generally receiv'd which has so little Foundation either in Reason or Religion either in Nature or common Sense it seems not only absurd but ridiculous there is not only no religious Reason in it but it is inconsistent with it self what seems only wonderful and unaccountable in it is that such gross things should make such Impressions and that it should be so impossible to beat it out of the Heads of the possess'd People  IF you should offer to tell them that no hidden Money was ever thus discover'd they would laugh at it as the greatest Jest imaginable and tell you there were five hundred Examples to the contrary and yet in all my Search after those things and after evidence of Fact I cannot arrive to one Example where ever an Apparition directed to the finding Money hid in the Ground or Earth or any other place and that any Authentick Voucher has been brought to prove it I know there have been many perhaps thousands of such Stories told and the Particulars are handed down with them but I say I never met with any Authentick Proof of the Fact such as that the Story might be told after them for Truth and that a Man might say without Blushing that he  believ'd it And let us but enter a little into the usual manner in which those Tales are related there seems to be something so weak and silly in the telling as if it was only calculated for Children and Chimney corners for Example the Apparition is call'd a Ghost 'tis dress'd up to suit the weakness of the Imagination in a Shrowd as if it came just out of the Coffin and the Churchyard and as if the Habit of the Dead was assum'd to possess the People with the Fancy of its being really the dead Body of the Person and yet allow it at the same time to be a Spirit  WELL when it comes and be it what you will forms it self in Apparition all in white and in a Shroud what is next it says nothing to you but goes away before you and perhaps speaks and bids you go or come along with it or perhaps without speaking at all leading and beckoning the Parties they have appear'd to to follow them and then stamping with the Foot it disappears at once  THIS Stamp with the Foot is reckon'd to be a Direction to you to dig just there in order to find some extraordinary Treasure and he would be reckon'd very stupid and sordidly dull that should neglect the Direction and not dig there and many a vain and fruitless Pit has been dug on such occasions to no purpose at all  BUT that I may not declare my Infidelity in these things in an unreasonable manner and disbelieve without any just Reason let me give you a long Story which seems to be left upon Record of a Pedlar in the Town ofin  Suffolk  a Story believ'd as certainly as the Gospel and which it would be thought very absurd for any one to question the Truth of  THERE was a Pedlar  says the Story  who us'd to travel about the Country with his Pack but  kept a Chamber or Warehouse in the MarketTown for the depositing and laying up some Goods which he had there and which were too many at a time to carry them all about with him  IT happen'd that this Man having been abroad late and coming home with his Pack sat himself down upon a Stile resting his Pack at the same time for his Ease while he sat here there came up to him a Ghost in the Appearance of a Woman dress'd as above she came up to him with a smiling Countenance and when she discover'd her self she stept backward and holding up a fine white Hand beckoned to him with a Finger to follow her  THE Pedlar frighted as he was immediately follow'd the Apparition what he did in the mean time with his Pack that's a gap in the Story which Tradition has not supply'd the Apparition leads him in this manner going backward and beckoning with her Hand over two or three Fields 'till it came to a particular place where there lay a great Stone and there giving a stamp with its Foot it vanished  THE Man takes the hint marks the Stone goes home to carry his Pack as we ought to suppose and comes out the next Night with a Spade and a Pick Axe and goes to work to dig a great Pitt in the Earth  HE had not dug far it seems tho' the Story does not say expresly how far but he found a large Chest I say large for it could not be a small one by what you shall hear presently  HE doubled his Diligence when he came to the Chest and with great Labour at length got it out of the place and we may suppose was not long before he found means to split it open and get into the inside of it to see the Contents for he found it very heavy when he labour'd to get it out  IN a word he found the Chest full of Silver that is to say full of Money then keeping his own Council he took care to deposite it so that by some and some he got the Money all safe home and after that carried the Chest home also  WHAT the Sum was that he found here the Story is not particular in but it seems the bulk was such that the Pedlar thought fit to leave off his travelling about the Country as a Pedlar takes a House in the Town furnishes himself a Shop and becomes a settled Inhabitant and Shopkeeper During his appearing in this Figure it happen'd that the Parish Church being exceeding old and out of Repair the Parishioners whether by order of the Diocesan upon a Visitation or by the voluntary act and deed of themselves the Parishioners I know not resolv'd to Repair the Church  IN order to furnish the needful Sums for this good Work they call a Vestry and propose a Subscription of the Inhabitants for supporting the Expence so the Minister and Church Wardens go about from House to House to see what the Charitable Parishioners would contribute and among the rest they at length came to the Pedlar's now Shopkeeper's House and he being told their Business desires them to walk in  AFTER some Discourse and perhaps treating his Neighbours he asks for their Roll or Subscription Paper in order to subscribe looking over the Roll he sees Sir  Thomas  five Pounds another Gentleman five Pounds another ten Pounds another forty Shillings and so on Come says he give a poor Pedlar the Pen and Ink Will your Gentry subscribe no more than that so he takes the Pen and subscribes five and twenty Pounds  SOME time after this having Occasion to make a Hatch to his ShopDoor as in the Country is very frequent it happen'd that sending for a Workman  to make this Hatch and looking about among his old Lumber he found nothing so proper as the old Chest that the Money was found in and accordingly a Hatch was made of it  AWHILE after this as the Pedlar was sitting in his Shop he observ'd an Ancient Gentleman who liv'd in the Town and who had the Reputation of a Scholar and particularly of a great Antiquary stood poring very earnestly with his Spectacles on upon his new Hatch This brought the Pedlar to the Door who after waiting a good while to see what it was the old Gentleman had discover'd at last he ask'd him what it was he found upon his new Hatch that was worth so much of his notice  TRULY Neighbour  says the Gentleman  what I observe is very remarkable tho' I cannot tell the Meaning of it and I suppose 'tis in a Character that you cannot easily read as well as in a Language that you may not understand  THE Pedlar desir'd he would read it to him  WHY  says the Gentleman  you do not understand it when I have read it  BUT Sir  says the Pedlar  can you not tell the meaning of it in  English  WHY  says the old Gentleman  it is the old  Saxon English  in the ancient  Gothic  Character and it may be read thus  Where This once stood  Stands another twice as good  HUM  says the Pedlar  that's old stuff indeed what can that signify  NAY  says the old Gentleman  that I don't know for who can tell where this stood  AY who indeed  says the Pedlar  and if they did what can there be in that  THEY had a little more Chat of that kind but in short  the Pedlar  got rid of his old Gentleman as soon as he could and began to ruminate upon the thing  where this stood  Why I know well enough  says he to himself  where this stood I must go and see it may be there is some more of the same  BUT then he argued why this is so many Years ago six or seven at least it seems and if it was a Ghost or Spirit that show'd me the way to it I warrant she has show'd some body else the way to the rest Indeed I did not deserve it that I did not look farther when I was at it to be sure it's gone by this time  THUS he argued himself almost out of the thing again 'till  t length he told his Wife of it who it seems had been in the Secret before  WHY you are mad  says she  why don't you go immediately to the place  NAY  says he  I don't know whether I can find it again or no now  WHAT  says his Wife  must the  Devil  come to show it you again sure you an't so dull but you may find it again  WELL the Man went however indeed his Wife drove him out almost Go try  says she  you can but come without it  HE goes and found the place in general but could not distinguish the particular Spo  which was levell'd partly by himself when he fill'd up the Hole again and partly grown up with Grass and Weeds so he comes back again and tells his Wife he could not tell which was the Place so as to be particular enough to go to Work  WELL  says his Wife  go in the Night I warrant you the good  Devil  that show'd you the first will put you in some way to find the rest if there is any more  SO prevail'd with by his Wife's Importunity away he went and I think they say his Wife went with him being come to the Place the Apparition appear'd to them again and show'd them in the same manner as before the very Spot and then vanish'd  IN short the Man went to work and digging a little deeper than he did before he found another Chest or Coffer bounded about with Iron not so big as the other but richer for as the first was full of Silver so this was full of Gold  THEY carry'd it home with Joy enough as you may suppose and opening it found as above a very great Treasure Fame has not handed down the Sum but something may be guess'd at by the latter part of the Story  which is told thus  IT seems that all this while the Repair of the Church mention'd above went on but slowly according to the old Saying  it was ChurchWork  and a Vestry being call'd upon some other Churchwork the Pedlar who was present among the rest of his Neighbours took occasion to complain that he thought that Business was not honestly manag'd that it was indeed like  ChurchWork  carried on heavily  SOME of the Gentlemen took him up a little and told him he took too much upon him that it was none of his Affair that he was not in Trust for the Work that they to whom it was committed knew their Business and that he should let it alone and mind his Shop  HE answer'd it was true that he was not trusted with it if he had it should have been finished before now and that he had a right to complain because he paid to it as well as other People adding that if they did not dispatch he would complain to the Bishop and obtain another Visitation  THIS alarm'd the People entrusted so they gave him good Words and told him the truth was the Parish Stock was almost gone and that they had not Money to go on 'till the Gentlemen would come into a second Collection  SAY you so says the Pedlar there may be some Reason in that you can't go on indeed without Money but pray how much do you want  THEY told him it would cost near two hundred Pounds more to fin  sh it and do but indifferently neither for the Roof wanted to be taken off and they feared the Timber was rotten and would require so much Addition they were afraid to look into it  IN a word he bid the Churchwardens call a Vestry upon that particular Affair and he would put them in a way to finish it  A VESTRY was call'd the Pedlar told them that seeing they were poor and could not raise Money to go on with it they should leave it to him and he would finish it for them  ACCORDINGLY he took the Work upon himself laid out near a Thousand Pounds and almost newbuilt the Church in Memory of which on the Glasswindows there stand the Figures of the Pedlar and his Pack and as the People fancy there is also the Apparition beckoning to him to come to the Place where he dug up the Money  THUS far the Story How Traditio  came to hand it down to us in this manner and so turn it into a Fable I have nothing to do with but the real and more probable Part of the Tale is recorded thus  THAT there was a  Pether  so the old  English  calls him that is a  Pedl  r  who having long used to travel up and down the Country with his Horse and his Wife and himself all three loaded with their Goods and going from House to House for many Years was grown rich by his Industry and that being too old to continue the laborious  Part he took a Lodging first in the Town and sold his Goods in a Chamber and in the Markets only but afterward took a House and a Shop in the Marketplace and drove a great Trade  THAT growing thus to be very rich he contributed upon their first coming about for a Subscription twenty five Pounds towards the Repair of the Church and after that finding they wanted Money to finish it took the Work wholly into his own Hand and finish'd the Church at his own Charge and that the Parish in Gratitude to his Memory caused that Figure of the Pedlar to be painted upon the Glass where the Pedlar and his Pack is represented in one Place travelling about the Country by which he got his Living  IN another Place there are Workmen digging the Foundation of the Church and the Pedlar giving them Directions what to do and how to proceed and in another the Church is built up a great way and almost to the Roof and the Pedlar still directing  IN another Place an Angel is painted standing by the Pedlar and pointing with a Rod or Staff in his Hand to a Place where the Pedlar sets two Workmen to dig  NOW from the Pedlar's being grown so unexpectdly rich common Fame it seems raised a Report that he had found a Chest of Money in the Ground and after that another It seems also there is an Original for the two Verses too which is thus when the Pedlar had first contributed twenty five Pounds towards building the Church and yet the Parishoners told him they could not go on for want of Money he told them they should not be discouraged he had given them one Bag of Money and says he  where that stood stands another twice as good  I'll do it my self  HENCE they thought the Pedlar must certainly have found some Money that had been hid in the Ground and that the  Devil  had discover'd it to him and so came the whole Story to grow up by little and little into the Form as I have told it and now to confirm it farther they tell us the Angel which perhaps might be but indifferently painted on the Glass or on the Wall of the Church is taken for the Ghost that discover'd the two Chests of Money to the Pedlar and is showing where to dig for it  THUS the Story of an Apparition is handed on to Posterity and now 'tis as curr  ntly believ'd in the Country almost as the Gospel and any Man would be thought very bold that should pretend to contradict it or to say that it is not true in every Particular  IF all the Stories of Apparitions leading People to dig for Money were as well trac'd as this I believe they might be found as plainly fictitious Invention has been mighty fruitful upon this particular kind of Notion that when Money is hidden some Spirit or Apparition will discover it as if the Souls of those that hid the Money were disturb'd 'till it was found out and made use of  HOW absurd the very Suggestion it self is I can hardly think worth while to speak of again but there are other Difficulties in it also if an Apparition knows of and discovers this Money  WHY not discover it sooner Why let it lie in the Ground sometimes two or three hundred Years before it has been discover'd and then an Apparition comes from none knows where to bring it to light  WHY is the Discovery made to a Stranger and not to some of the Line or Race of those to whom the Money did at first belong One would suppose the Apparition came or was sent or directed  to come to do Justice and to give the Money lost to the right Owner whereas these Discoveries are often pretended to be made to Strangers who have no Claim or any Right to it or any Relation to those who laid it there and this indeed is unaccountable and makes the rest of the Story improbable to be true  If Ghosts or Apparitions and Spirits or call them what you will are thus officious and busy to discover Money hid in the Earth so as to run up and down to Strangers who are no way related to it or to the Race or Families who were first concern'd in it Why then do they not discover all the Money that is thus deposited in the Dark and which no doubt is yet in great Quantities lodged out of the Reach of Mortal Sight and of which we find frequent Discoveries made as particularly a great Parcel of old Gold found lately in the digging up the old Foundation of a House in  Oxfordshire  A great Parcel of  Roman  Gold Coin and Medals found this very Year in digging up an old Vault in  France  and which must have lain there a thousand Years at least and no kind Apparition came to discover it in so long time  MANY such Examples are daily shown us of Money found Underground without the Help of the  Devil  or of any Apparition Spirit or Ghost to discover it and which had lain ever since the Time of the  Romans  conceal'd and unknown  FROM all which Reasons I must conclude that the departed Spirits know nothing of these things that it is not in their Power to discover their old Hoards of Money or to come hither to show us how we may come at it but that in short all the old Women's Stories which we have told us upon that Subject are indeed old Women's Stories and no more  I CANNOT quit this part of my Subject without observing that indeed if we give up all the Stories of Ghosts and Apparitions and Spirits walking to discover Money that is hid we shall lose to the Age half the good old Tales which serve to make up Winter Evening Conversation and shall deprive the Doctrine of Souls departed coming back hither to talk with us about such things of its principal Support for this indeed is one of the principal Errands such Apparitions come about  IT is without Doubt that Fancy and Imagination form a world of Apparitions in the Minds of Men and Women for we must not exclude the Ladies in this Part whatever we do and People go away as thoroughly possess'd with the Reality of having seen the  Devil  as if they convers'd Face to Face with him when in short the Matter is no more than a Vapour of the Brain a sick delirious fume of Smoke in the Hypochondria forming it self in such and such Figure to the Eyesight of the Mind as well as of the Head which all look'd upon with a calm Revision would appear as it really is nothing but a Nothing a Skeleton of the Brain a Whymsy and no more  So Hypochondriack Vapours represent  Ships Armies Battels in the Firmament  'Till steddy Sight the Exhalation  solves  And all to its first Matter  Cloud  dissolves  IT is out of Question that the Imagination forms a great many of these Visions in the Heads of the People that relate them again to us and they as firmly believe them to be real Apparitions as I believe them to be nothing but Vapours and Cloud But on the other hand it cannot be deny'd but that there is a strange Forwardness among our People  to propagate nay to raise and invent such Stories of Apparitions and Visions to furnish them out with popular Circumstances and to spread them as Realities meerly and on purpose to form a plausible Relation and perhaps some according to Custom fall into that old Schoolboy's Error of telling the Tale over so often 'till they believe it to be Truth  BUT all this Fiction and Fable of which the World is so full does not at all lessen the solid Part which I first advanc'd and still insist upon  viz  The Reality of Apparition in general for the fruitfulness of other Mens Imagination in coining of Falshood does not at all lessen the Validity of a Truth which the Lie is made to Mimick and Counterfeit  WE have had a world of Tales impos'd upon the World about Apparitions shewing themselves to abundance of People  before at and after  the late Massacre in  Ireland Ann  and it would fill up a Volume of itself to give an Account of them nor is it possible to distinguish between those of them that are Real and those that were Imaginary especially at this Distance of Time but if I may believe the Report of those that were upon the Spot and of others who receiv'd the Accounts from the most Judicious and most Considering of those who were upon the Spot the Fears and Apprehensions of the People especially in  Dublin  where they expected the Murtherers would break in upon them every Day fill'd them with Dream and Phantosm Vision and Apparition when indeed there was nothing in it but their own dreadful Apprehensions  NOR could they be so much blam'd as in other Cases for here were People escap'd from the Murtherers even out of their very Hands some that had seen their Wives Children Fathers Mothers  Husbands Neighbours butcher'd before their Faces and no Wonder if these had the Images of Death before their Eyes after they arriv'd no Wonder if they had Apparitions and Visions of the like Mischiefs every Hour  NO Wonder if they saw Clouds of  Irish  Armies in the Air heard Shrieks of dying murther'd Women and Children and that they vouch'd these things with the utmost Solemnity Now 'tis true in the common Notions of Humanity one cou'd not but pity those poor People and give allowance to their Fears and to the Fright and Horrors that were upon their Minds yet it does not at all follow that we who are not under the same Impressions must come into the Delusion with them give up our Understanding and our Reason to their imagin'd Visions  WE are to judge of those things by the Rules by which we ought to judge in like Cases and after you have made Allowances for the Terrors and Fright which the poor People might be in then we should consider the rational Part for where the Apparition is real the Rational Part is always apparent as well as the Visionary Part for Example  WHAT Apparitions came from a good Hand and for the good of the innocent People whose Dangers were so imminent would certainly come in some Space of Time before the Danger either so as to give Opportunity of Escape or at least Preparatory Warnings that the People might have time to look up to Heaven which the butchering Enemy would not spare them and such Apparitions as these I should be inclin'd to give the most Heed to but of these we read of very few  ON the other hand to what Purpose could Apparitions show themselves afterward and from whom did they come If the Souls of the murther'd  Protestants cou'd appear and cry for Revenge why did they not all appear as well as one Woman at  BandonBridge  Why did they not Haunt the Murtherers in a most frightful manner and terrify them Night and Day 'till they brought their own Guilt to be the worst of Apparitions to them  WHY did not the Terror of Blood lie upon them like a constant  Devil  harrassing their Souls and terrifying them 'till they were made their own Executioners We saw none of these Things happen either to them or to the Murtherers Actors and Directors of the  Parisian  Massacre  Charles  IX King of  Fr  nce  by whose Direction it was all manag'd died as compos'd without any Repentance for it as if he had never been concern'd in it calmly giving Directions for the Administration of the Affairs of the Government after him and told his Mother how to act with the Hugonots 'till his Brother the King of  Poland  should arrive  IN  Ireland  the Priests and Zealots nay the very Women boasted of the Number they had kill'd show'd the Skeins or Daggers with which they cut the Throats of the Protestants one so many and another so many their Soldiers fought as fearless after it as before nor did any Apparition haunt them that ever I met with any Account of  ON the other hand for the  Devil  's disturbing them I see no Reason in it the  Devil  was not at all displeas'd with the Fact what should he disturb them for he wou'd rather appear to assist them encourage them harden them in it take all Remorse from them and reproach them with Cowardice if they shew'd the least Inclination to Pity tho' I don't hear of the least Blame the  Devil  himself could lay upon them of that kind  AS to Apparitions after it was over I do not see Room to think them so much as Rational  there was not the least Occasion of them or Use for them the Mischief was done what could the invisible World have to say to any body about it after it was done We do not read of any Apparitions Voices Noises Signs or Wonders at  Jerusalem  after the Temple was destroy'd tho' above a Million of People are said by  Josephus  to have perished there There were Signs and horrible Noises Apparitions and Voices before it in several Places but none after it the miserable Dead lay quiet in their Heaps  Graves they could not be call  d  and gave neither their Friends or Enemies any Disturbance  TO conclude The sham Apparitions which People put upon themselves are indeed very many and our Hypochondriack People see more  Devils  at noonday than  Galilaeus  did Stars and more by many than ever really appear'd But this no ways Impeaches the main Proposition  viz  That there are really and truly Apparitions of various kinds and that Spirits or Angels call them what we will Inhabitants of the invisible and empty Spaces do visit us here upon many Occasions either for Good or Evil as He who made them is pleas'd to direct  THE general End and Design of Providence in suffering such things and the Use and Application to our selves which we are directed to make of them in common Prudence how far they are or are not mercifully restrain'd from hurting us and even from terrifying and affrighting us if our Reason could be our Governour in such Cases with a great Number of Examples in Story of the effect of such Apparitions as have been allow'd to visit Mankind whether peaceably or otherwise thes  would take up a great deal more room But I am run my length in the present Relation and the Reader must be content to draw Consequences for himself from what is said to guide his Judgment in  the variety of such Cases as may happen his only way in our Opinion is to keep an even pace between Apprehension and Contempt neither to fear or desire them but resolve to act with the Calmness and Courage of a Christian in whatever may be his Case  BUT above all I would beg my reading merry Friends of the  thoughtless kind  not to be so much surpriz'd at the Apparitions of their own Brain not to start and be frighted when they first make  Devils  by Daylight and then see them in the dark and as they may be assur'd they will hardly ever see any thing worse than themselves so let them resolve not to be scar'd at Shadows or amus'd with Vapours mistaking the  Devil  for an Ass and tell us of the Saucer Eyes of a Pinkeyed Bear not fancy they see a Hearse with headless Horses and take the Night Cart for a fiery Chariot which one would think they might distinguish by their Noses unless they will own that their Fear gave them a worse Smell than that of the  Devil  FINIS
