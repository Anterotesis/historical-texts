 ULYSSES A TRAGEDY  ULYSSES A TRAGEDY  As it is Acted at the QUEEN'S THEATRE in the  HayMarket  By Her MAJESTY's Sworn Servants  Written by  N ROWE    Esq  Stultorum Regum Populorum continet astus  Rursus quid Virtus quid Sapientia possit  Utile proposuit Nobis exemplar Ulyssem  Horat Epist Bib Epist  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  within  GraysInn  Gate next  GraysInn  Lane  To the Right Honourable  Sidney  Lord  Godolphin  Lord HighTreasurer of  England  and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter  My LORD  IF those Cares in which the Service of a Great QUEEN and the Love of Your Country have so justly Engag'd Your Lordship would allow any Leisure to run back and remember those Arts and Studies which were once the Grace and Entertainment of  Your Lordship's Youth I have Presumption enough to hope that this Tragedy may some Time or other find an Hour to Divert Your Lordship Poetry which was so venerable to former Ages as in many Places to make a Part of their Religious Worship and every where to be had in the highest Honour and Esteem has miserably languish'd and been despis'd for want of that Favour and Protection which it found in the Famous  Augustan  Age Since then it may be asserted without any Partiality to the Present Time it never had a fairer Prospect of lifting up its Head and returning to its former Reputation than now And the best Reason can be given for it is that it seems to have a particular Hope from and Dependance upon Your Lordship and to expect all just Encouragement when those Great Men who have the Power to Protect it have so Delicate and Polite a Taste and Understanding of its True Value The Restoring and Preserving any Part of Learning is so Generous an Action in it  self that it naturally falls into Your Lordship's Province since every Thing that may serve to Improve the Mind has a Right to the Patronage of so Great and Universal a Genius for Knowledge as Your Lordship's It is indeed a Piece of good Fortune upon which I cannot help Congratulating the present Age that there is so Great a Man at a Time when there is so great an Occasion for him The Divisions which Your Lordship has heal'd the Temper which You have restor'd to our Councils and that indefatigable Care and Diligence which You have us'd in preserving our Peace at Home are Benefits so virtuously and so seasonably conferr'd upon Your Country as shall draw the Praises of all Wise Men and the Blessings of all Good Men upon Your Lordship's Name And when those unreasonable Feuds and Animosities which keep Faction alive shall be bury'd in silence and forgotten that great Publick Good shall be universally acknowledg'd as the Happy Effect of Your Lordship's most Equal  Temper and Right Understanding That this Glorious End may very suddenly succeed to Your Lordship's Candor and Generous Endeavours after it must be the Wish of every good  Englishman  I am My LORD  Your Lordship's most Obedient Humble Servant N ROWE  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr  Betterton  TO Night in Honour of the marry'd Life  Our Author Treats you with a Virtuous Wife  A Lady who for Twenty Years withstood  The pressing Instances of Flesh and Blood  Her Husband still a Man of Sense reputed  Unless this Tale his Wisdom have confuted  Left her at ripe Eighteen to seek Renown  And Battel for a Harlot at  Troy  Town  To fill his Place fresh Lovers came in Shoals  Much such as now adays are  Cupid  's Tools  Some Men of Wit but the most part were Fools  They sent her  Billets doux  and Presents many  Of ancient Tea and  Thericlean  China  Rail'd at the Gods toasted her o'er and o'er  Dress'd at Her danc'd and fought and sigh'd and swore  In short did all that Men could do to have her  And Damn'd them'elves to get into her Favour  But all in vain the Virtuous Dame stood Buff  And let 'em know that she was Coxcomb Proof  Messieurs  the  Beaux  what think you of the Matter  Don't you believe old  Homer  given to Flatter  When you approach and pressing the soft Hand  Favours with wellbred Impudence demand  Is it in Woman's Weakness to withstand  Cease to be vain and give the Sex their Due  Our  English  Wives shall prove this Story true  We have our Chaste  Penelope's  who mourn  Their Widow'd Beds and wait their Lords Return  We have our Heroes too who bravely bear  Far from their Home the Dangers of the War  Who careless of the Winter Season's Rage  New Toils explore and in new Cares engage  From Realm to Realm their Chief unweary'd goes  And restless journies on to give the World Repose  Such are the constant Labours of the Sun  Whose active glorious Course is never done  And tho' when hence he parts with us 'tis Night  Still he goes on and lends to other Worlds his Light  Ye beauteous Nymphs with open Arms prepare  To meet the Warriors and reward their Care  May you for ever kind and faithful prove  And pay their Days of Toil with Nights of Love  EPILOGUE  Spoke by Mrs  Bracegirdle  JUST going to take Water at the Stairs  I stopp'd and came again to beg your Pray'rs  You see how ill my Love has been repaid  That I am like to live and die a Maid  Poetick Rules and Justice to maintain  I to the Woods am order'd back again  To Madam  Cinthia  and her Virgin Train  'Tis an uncomfortable Life they lead  Instead of Quilts and Down the Silvan Bed  With Skins of Beasts with Leaves and Moss is spread  No Morning Toilets do their Chambers grace  Where famous Pearl  Cosmeticks  find a Place  With Powder for the Teeth and Plaister for the Face  But in Defiance of Complexion they  Like arrant Huswives rise by Break of Day  Cut a brown Crust saddle their Nags and Mounting  In scorn of the GreenSickness ride a Hunting  Your  Sal  and Hartshorn Drops they deal not in  They have no Vapours nor no witty Spleen  No Coffee to be had and I am told  As to the Tea they drink 'tis mostly cold  For Conversation nothing can be worse  'Tis all amongst themselves and that's the Curse  One Topick there as here does seldom fail  We Women rarely want a Theme to rail  But bating that one Pleasure of Backbiting  There is no Earthly Thing they can delight in  There are no  Indian  Houses to drop in  And fancy Stuffs and chuse a pretty Screen  To while away an Hour or so  I swear  These Cups are pretty but they're deadly dear  And if some unexpected Friend appear  The Dev'lWho cou'd have thought to meet you here  We should but very badly entertain  You that delight in Toasting and Champaign  But keep your tender Persons safe at home  We know you hate hard Riding But if some  Tough honest Country FoxHunter would come

O  Mentor  Urge no more my Royal Birth  Urge not the Honours of my Race Divine  Call not to my Remembrance what I am  Born of  Ulysses  and deriv'd from  Jove  For 'tis the Curse of mighty Minds opprest  To think what their State is and what it shou'd be  Impatient of their Lot they reason siercely  And call the Laws of Providence unequal  Men  And therefore wert thou bred to virtuous Knowledge  And Wisdom early planted in thy Soul  That thou might'st know to rule thy fiery Passions  To bind their Rage and stay their headlong Course  To bear with Accidents and ev'ry Change  Of various Life to struggle with Adversity  To wait the Leisure of the righteous Gods  'Till they in their own good appointed Hour  Shall bid thy better Days come forth at once  A long and shining Train

Precepts due  'Tis a just Rage and honest Indignation  Ten Years ran round e'er  Troy  was doom'd to fall  Ten tedious Summers and ten Winters more  By turns have chang'd the Seasons since it fell  And yet we mourn my Godlike Father's Absence  As if the  Graecian  Arms had ne'er prevail'd  But  Jove  and  Hector  still maintain'd the War  Men  Tho' absent yet if Oracles are true  He lives and

of his Royal Name  Despis'd and set at nought his State o'errun  Devour'd and parcell'd out by Slaves so vile  That if oppos'd to him 'twou'd make Comparison  Absurd and monstrous seem as if to mate  A MoleHill with  Olympus  Aeth  He was my Friend  I think I knew him And to do him right  He was a Man indeedNot as these are  A Rioter or Doer of foul Wrongs  But boldly just and more like what Man shou'd be  Tel  From Morn 'till Noon from Noon 'till the Shades darken  From Evening 'till the Morning dawns again  Lewdness Confusion Insolence and Uproar  Are all the Bus'ness of their guilty Hours  The Cries of Maids enforc'd the Roar of Drunkards  Mixt with the braying of the Minstrels Noise  Who ministers to Mirth ring thro' the Palace  And eccho to the Arch of Heav'n their Crimes  Behold ye Gods who judge betwixt your Creatures  Behold the Rivals of the great  Ulysses  Mem  Doubt not but all their Crimes and all thy Wrongs  Are judg'd by  Nemesis  and equal  Jove  Suffer the Fools to laugh and loll secure  This is their DayBut there is one behind  For Vengeance and  Ulysses  Aeth  'Till that Day  That Day of Recompence and rightcous Justice  Learn thou my Son the cruel Arts of Courts  Learn to dissemble Wrongs to smile at Injuries  And suffer Crimes thou want'st the Power to punish  Be easie assable familiar friendly  Search and know all Mankinds mysterious Ways  But trust the Secret of thy Soul to none  Believe me seventy Years and all the Sorrows  That seventy Years bring with 'em thus have taught me  Thus only to be safe in such a World as this is  Enter  Antinous

with  Semanthe  's Accents  There pour thy Balm into my Lovesick Soul  And heal my Cares for ever  Exeunt  Tele  and  Ant  Aeth  This smooth Speaker  This supple Courtier is in Favour with you  Markt you the Prince how at this Man's Approach  The Fierceness Rage and Pride of Youth declin'd  His changing Visage wore a Form more g  ntle  And ev'ry Feature took a softer Turn  As if his Soul bent on some new Employment  Of different Purpose from the Thought before  Had summon'd other Counsels other Passions  And drest her in a gay fantastick Garb  Fit for th'Adventure which she meant to prove  By  Jove  I lik'd it not  Men  The Prince whose Temper  Is open as the Day and unsuspecting  Esteems him as devoted to his Service  Wise Brave and Just And since his late Return  From  Nestor's  Court at  Pyle  he still has held him  In more especial Nearness to his Heart  Aeth  'Tis rash and savours of unwary Youth  Tell him he trusts too farIf I mistook not  You said he was a Woer  Men  True he was  Noble by Birth and mighty in his Wealth  Proud of the Patriots Name and Peoples Praise  By Gifts by friendly Offices and Eloquence  He won the Herd of  Ithacans  to think him  Ev'n worthy to supply his Master's Place  Aeth  Unthinking changeable ungrateful  Ithaca    But  Mentor  say the Queen Cou'd she forget  The Difference 'twixt  Ulysses  and his Slave  Did not her Soul resent the Violation  And spight of all the Wrongs she labour'd under  Dash his Ambition and presumptuous Love  Men  Still Great and Royal in the worst of Fortunes  With native Pow'r and Majesty array'd  She aw'd this rash  lxion  with her Frown  Taught him to bend his abject Head to Earth  And own his humbler LotHe stood rebuk'd  And full of guilty Sorrow for the past  Vow'd to repeat the daring Crime no more  But with Humility and loyal Service  To purge his Fame and wash the Stains away  Aeth  Deceit and Artifice the Turn's too sudden  Habitual Evils seldom change so soon  But many Days must pass and many Sorrows  Conscious Remorse and Anguish must be felt  To curb Desire to break the stubborn Will  And work a second Nature in the Soul  E'er Virtue can resume the Place she lost  'Tis else DissimulationBut no more  The ruffling Train of Suiters are at hand  Those mighty Candidates for Love and Empire  'Tis well the Gods are mild when these dare hope  To merit their best Gifts by Riot and Injustice  Enter  Polydamas Agenor Thoon Ephialtes  and Attendants  Pol  Our Souls are out of Tune we languish all  Nor does the sweet Returning of the Dawn  Chear with its usual Mirth our drowzy Spirits  That droop'd beneath the lazy leaden Night  Agen  Can we who swear we love smile or be gay  When our fair Queen the Goddess of our Vows  She that adorns our Mirth and gilds our Day  Withholds the Beams that only can revive us  Tho  Night must involve the World 'till she appear  The Flowers in painted Meadows hang their Heads  The Birds awake not to their Morning Songs  Nor early Hinds renew their constant Labour  Ev'n Nature seems to slumber 'till her Call  Regardless of th'Approach of any other Day  Eph  Why is she then withheld this publick Good  Why does she give those Hours that should rejoyce us  To Tears Perverseness and to sullen Privacy  While vainly here we waste our lusty Youth  In Expectation of the uncertain Blessing  Pol  For twice two Years this coy this cruel Beauty  Has mock'd our Hopes and crost 'em with Delays  At length the female Artifice is plain  The Riddle of her mystick Web is known  Which e'er her second Choice she swore to weave  While still the secret Malice of the Night  Undid the Labours of the former Day  Agen  Hard are the Laws of Love's despotick Rule  And ev'ry Joy is trebly bought with Pain  Crown we the Goblet then and call on  Bacchus  Bacchus  the jolly God of laughing Pleasures  Bid ev'ry Voice of Harmony awake  Apollo's  Lyre and  Hermes  tuneful Shell  Let Wine and Musick joyn to swell the Triumph  To sooth uneasie Thought and lull Desire  Aeth  Is this the Rev'rence due to sacred Beauty  Or these the Rights the  Cyprian  Goddess claims  These rude licentious Orgyes are for  Satyrs  And such the drunken Homage which they pay  To old  Silenus  nodding on his Ass  But be it as it may it speaks you well  Eph  What says the Slave  Tho  Oh 'tis the Snarler  Aethon  A priviledg'd TalkerGive him leave to rail  Or send for  Irus  forth his fellow Drole  And let 'em play a Match of Mirth before us  And Laughter be the Prize to crown the Victor  Aeth  And dost thou answer to Reproof with Laughter  But do so still and be what thou wert born  Stick to thy native Sense and scorn Instruction  Oh Folly What an Empire hast thou here  What Temples shall be rais'd to thee What Crowds  Of slav'ring hooting senseless shameful Ideots  Shall worship at thy ignominious Altars  While Princes are thy Priests  Pol  Why shou'dst thou think  O'erweening Insolent Unmanner'd Slave  That Wisdom does forsake the Wealth the Honours  And full Prosperity of Princes Courts  To dwell with Rags and Wretchedness like thine  Why do'st thou call him Fool  Aeth  Speech is most free  It is  Jove  's Gift to all Mankind in common  Why do'st thou call me poor and think me wretched  Pol  Because thou art so  Aeth  Answer to thy self  And let it serve for thee and for thy Friend  Agen  He talks like Oracles obscure and short  Aeth  I wou'd be understood but Apprehension  Is not thy TalentMidnight Surfeits Wine  And painful undigested Morning Fumes  Have marr'd thy Understanding  Eph  Hence thou Miscreant  My Lords this Railer is not to be born  Aeth  And wherefore art thou born thou publick Grievance  Thou Tyrant born to be a Nation's Punishment  To scourge thy guilty Subjects for their Crimes  And prove Heaven's sharpest Vengeance  Eph  Spurn him hence  And tear the rude unhallow'd Railer's Tongue  Forth from his Throat  Aeth  If brutal Violence  And Lust of foul Revenge shou'd urge thee on  Spight of the Queen and Hospitable  Jove  T'oppress a Stranger single and unarm'd  Yet mark me well I was not born thy Vassal  And wert thou ten times greater than thou art  And ten times more a King thus wou'd I meet thee  Thus naked as I am I wou'd oppose thee  And fight a Woman's Battel with my Hands  E'er thou shoud'st do me Wrong and go unpunish'd  Eph  Ha do'st thou brave me Dog  Coming up to  Aethon  Tho  Avant  Pol  Begon  Enter  Eurymachus  Eur  What Daughter of old  Chaos  and the Night  What Fury loiters yet behind the Shades  To vex the peaceful Morn with Rage and Uproar  Each frowning Visage doubly dy'd with Wrath  Your Voices in tumultuous Clamours rais'd  Venting Reproach and stirring strong Contention  Say you have been at VarianceSpeak ye Princes  Whence grew th'Occasion  Aeth  King of  Samos  hear me  To thee as to a King worthy the Name  The Majesty and Right Divine of Pow'r  Boldly I dare appealThis King of  Seriphos  Pointing to  Ephialtes  This Island Lord this Monarch of a Rock  He and his fellow Princes there yon' Band  Of eating drinking Lovers have in Scorn  Of the Gods Laws and Strangers Sacred Privilege  Offer'd me foul Offence and most unmanly Injuries  Eur  Away It is too muchYou wrong your Honours  To the Woers  And stain the Lustre of your Royal Names  To brawl and wrangle with a Thing beneath you  Are we not Chief on Earth and plac'd aloft  And when we poorly stoop to mean Revenge  We stand debas'd and level with the Slave  Who fondly dares us with his vain Defiance  Eph  Henceforward let the ribald Railer learn  To curb the lawless Licence of his Speech  Let him be dumb we wo'not brook his Prating  Eur  Go to You are too bitterBut no more  To  Aeth  Let ev'ry jarring Sound of Discord cease  Tune all your Thoughts and Words to Beauty's Praise  To Beauty that with sweet and pleasant Influence  Breaks Life the Daystar from the chearful East  For see where circled with a Crowd of Fair Ones  Fresh as the Spring and fragrant as its Flowers  Your Queen appears your Goddess your  Penelope  Enter the Queen with Ladies and other Attendants  Diana  thus on  Cynthus  shady Top  Or by  Eurota  's Stream leads to the Chace  Her Virgin Train a Thousand lovely Nymphs  Of Form Celestial all Troop by her Side  Amidst a Thousand Nymphs the Goddess stands confest  In Beauty Majesty and Port Divine  Supream and Eminent  Qu  If these sweet Sounds  This humble fawning Phrase this faithless Flattery  If these known Arts cou'd heal my wounded Soul  Cou'd recompence the Sorrows of my Days  Or sooth the Sighings of my lonely Nights  Well might you hope to woe me to your Wishes  And win my Heart with your fond Tales of Love  But since whate'er I've suffer'd for my Lord  From  Troy  the Winds and Seas the Gods and you  Is deeply writ within my sad Remembrance  Know Princes all your Eloquence is vain  Agen  If those bright Eyes that waste their Lights with Weeping  Wou'd kindly shine upon  Agenor  's Hopes  Behold he offers to his charming Queen  His Crown his Life his ever faithful Vows  What Joys soe'er or Love or Empire yield  To bless her future Days and make 'em happy all  Pol  Accept my Crown and Reign with me in  Delos  Tho  Mine and the Homage of my People wait you  Eph  I cannot Court you with a silken Tale  With easie ambling Speeches fram'd on Purpose  Made to be spoke in TuneBut be my Queen  And leave my plain spoke Love to prove its Merit  Qu  And am I yet to learn your Love your Faith  Are not my Wrongs gone up to Heav'n against you  Do they not stand before the Throne of  Jove  And call Incessant on his tardy Vengeance  What Sun has shon that has not seen your Insolence  Your wasteful Riot and your impious Mirth  Your Scorn of Old  Laerte's  feeble Age  Of my Son's Youth and of my Woman's Weakness  Ev'n in my Palace here my latest Refuge  For you are Lords of all besides in  Ithaca    With Ruffian Violence and murd'rous Rage  You menace the defenceless and the Stranger  And from th'unhospitable Dwelling drive  Safety and friendly Peace  Aeth  For me it matters not  Wrong is the Portion still of feeble Age  My toilsom Length of Days full oft has taught me  What 'tis to struggle with the Proud and Powerful  But 'tis for thy unhappy Fate fair Queen  'Tis to behold thy Beauty and thy Virtue  Transcendent both worthy the Gods who gave 'em  And worthy of their Care to see 'em left  Abandon'd and forsaken to rude Outrage  And made a Prize for Drunkards 'tis for this  My Soul takes Fire within and vainly urges  My cold enervate Hand t'assert thy Cause  Qu  Alas they scorn the Weakness of thy Age  As of my SexBut mark me well ye Princes  Whoe'er amongst you dares to lift his Hand  Against the hoary Head of this old Man  This good old Man this Friend of my  Ulysses  Him will I hold my worst my deadliest Foe  Him shall my Curses and Revenge pursue  And mark him from the rest with most distinguish'd Hatred  Eph  That you are weak defenceless and opprest  Impute not to the Gods they have befriended you  With lavish Hands they spread their Gifts before you  What Pride Revenge what wanton Love of Change  Or Woman's Wish can ask behold we offer you  Curse the Perverseness of your stubborn Will then  That has delay'd your Choice and in that Choice your Happiness  Qu  And must I hear this still and still endure it  Oh Rage Dishonour wretched helpless Queen  Return return my Hero my  Ulysses  Bring him again you cruel Seas and Winds  Troy  and Adult'rous  Paris  are no more  Restore him then you righteous Gods of  Greece  T'avenge himself and me upon these Tyrants  And do a second Justice here at home  Eur  Amongst the mighty  Manes  of the  Greeks  Great Names and fam'd for highest Deeds in War  His honour'd Shade rests from the Toils of Life  In everlasting Indolence and Ease  Careless of all your Pray'rs and vain Complainings  Which the Winds bear away and scatter in their Wantonness  Turn those bright Eyes then from Despair and Death  And fix your better Hopes among the Living  Fix 'em on One who dares who can Defend you  One worthy of your Choice  Qu  If my free Soul  Must stoop to this unequal hard Condition  If I must make this second hated Choice  Yet by Connubial  Juno  here I swear  None shall succeed my Lord but that brave Man  That dares avenge me well upon the rest  Then let whoever dares to Love be bold  Be like my former Hero made for War  Able to bend the Bow and toss the Spear  For ev'ry Wrong his injur'd Queen has found  Let him revenge and pay it with a Wound  Fierce from the Slaughter let the Victor come  And tell me that my Foes have met their Doom  Then plight his Faith upon his bloody Sword  And be what my  Ulysses  was my best my dearest Lord  Exeunt Queen  Mentor  and Attendants  Eur Eph Agen Thoon  and  Poly  following  Manet  Aethon  Aeth  O matchless Proof of Faith and Love unchang'd  Left in the Pride the wishing Warmth of Youth  For ten long Years and ten long Years to that  And yet so true Beset with strong Allurements  With Youth proud Pomp and soft bewitching Pleasure  'Tis wonderful and Wives in later Times  Shall think it all the Forgery of Wit  A Fable curiously contriv'd t'upbraid  Their fickle easie Faith and mock them for their Lightness  But see the  Samian  King returns  Enter  Eurymachus  Eur  I sought you  Amidst the Croud of Princes who attend  The Queen to  Juno  's Temple  Aeth  When I worship  And bow my self before the awful Gods  I mingle not with those who scorn their Laws  With raging brutal loose voluptuous Crouds  Who take the Gods for Gluttons like themselves  Eur  This sullen Garb this moody Discontent  Sits on thee well and I applaud thy Anger  Thy just Disdain of this licentious Rout  Yet all are not like these nor ought thy Quarrel  Be carry'd on to all Mankind in common  Aeth  Perhaps the untaught Plainness of my Words  May make you think my Manners rude and savage  But know my Country is the Land of Liberty  Phaeacia  's happy Isle that gave me Birth  Forbids not any to speak plain and truly  Sincere and open are we roughly Honest  Upright in Deed tho' simple in our Speech  As meaning not to Flatter or Offend  The Use of Words we have but not the Art  And ev'n as Nature dictates so we speak  Eur  Now by great  Juno  Guardian of our  Samos  In strong Description hast thou well exprest  That manly Virtue I wou'd make a Friend of  Nor thou brave  Aethon  shalt disdain our Amity  Our proffer'd Love for know that Kings like Gods  With all Things good adorn their own Creation  And where their Favour fixes there is Happiness  Aeth  Yes Sir you are a King a great one too  My humbler Birth has cast me far beneath you  And made me for the proffer'd Grace unfit  Friendship delights in equal Fellowship  Where Parity of Rank and mutual Offices  Engage both Sides alike and keep the Balance ev'n  'Tis irksome to a gen'rous grateful Soul  To be opprest beneath a Load of Favours  Still to receive and run in Debt to Friendship  Without the Pow'r of paying something back  Eur  I know thee grateful just and gen'rous Minds  Are always so nor is thy Pow'r so scanty  But that it may vye with a King's Munificence  May make me large Amends for all my Bounty  May bless me with a Benefit I want  And give me that which my Soul most desires  The Queen  Aeth  How Sir the Queen  Eur  The Beauteous Queen  That SummerSun in full Meridian Glory  Brighter than the faint Promise of the Spring  With Blessings ripen'd to the Gatherer's Hand  Mature for Joy and in Perfection lovely  Ev'n she  The Pride of  Greece  the Wish of youthful Princes  Severe and Cold and Rigid as she is  Looks gently on thee  Aethon  she beholds thee  With kind Regard and listens to thy Counsels  Aeth  Be still thou beating Heart  Aside  Well Sir go on  Eur  No more there needs no more thy piercing Wit  I read it in thy Eyes hath found my Purpose  Be favourable then be friendly to me  Nay I'll conjure thee by my Hopes by thine  Whither they follow Wealth or Power or Fame  Or what Desires soe'er warm thy Old Breast  Counsel me aid me teach me be my Friend  Aeth  Suppose me such what shou'd my Friendship profit you  Eur  Oh by Ten Thousand Ways has not that Age  That turn'd thy rev'rend Locks to Silver White  Has it not giv'n thee Skill in Womankind  Sagacious Wisdom to explore their Subtleties  Their coy Aversions and their eager Appetites  Their false Denials and their secret Yieldings  Yet more thy Friendship with her former Lord  Gives thee a Right to speak and be believ'd  Aeth  Then you wou'd have me woe her for you win her  This Queen this Wife of him that was my Friend  Eur  Thou speak'st me well of him that was thy Friend  His Death has broke those Bonds of Love and Friendship  And left me free and worthy to succeed  Both in her Heart and thine  Aeth  Excuse me Sir  Nor think I meant to question your high Worth  I am but ill at Praising or my Tongue  Had spoke the great Things that my Heart thinks of you  Suppose me wholly yoursYet do you hold  This Sov'raign Beauty made of such light Stuff  So like the common Changelings of her Sex  That he that flatter'd sigh'd and spoke her fair  Cou'd win her from her stubborn Resolution  And chast Reserv'dness with his sweet Persuasion  Eur  No were she form'd like them she were a Conquest  Beneath a Monarch's Love or  Aethon  's Wit  Not but I think she has her warmer Wishes  'Twere monstrous else and Nature had deny'd  Her choicest Blessing to her fairest Creature  Her soft Desires that steal abroad unseen  Like Silver  Cynthia  sliding from her Orb  At dead of Night to young  Endimion  's Arms  Aeth  How think you soBut so 'tis true it may be  The best of all the Sex is but a Woman  And why shou'd Nature break her Rule for One  To make One true when all the rest are false  To find those Wishes then those fond Desires  To trace the fulsome Haunts of wanton Appetite  She must be try'd  Eur  That to thy Care my  Aethon  Thy Wit and watchful Friendship I commend  Aeth  Yes Sir be certain on't she shall be try'd  Thro' all the winding Mazes of her Thoughts  Thro' all her Joys her Sorrows and her Fears  Thro' all her Truth and Falshood I'll pursue her  She shall be subtler than Deceit it self  And prosperously Wicked if she 'scape me  Eur  Thou art my Genius and my happier Hours  Depend upon thy Providence and Rule  This Day at her Return from  Juno  's Altar  I have obtain'd an Hour of private Conference  Aeth  What Private said you 'Twas a Mark of Favour  Distinguishingly kind  Eur  Somewhat I urg'd  That much concern'd her Honour and her Safety  Nay ev'n the Life of her belov'd

feign'd they linger long pretending  Rude Winter Seas with Omens that forbid  The frighted Mariner to leave the Shoar  While  Neptune  smooths his Waters for their Passage  And gently whistling Winds invite their Sails  As if they wish'd to waft them back to  Samos  Arc  Ulysses  is no more the partial Gods  Who favour'd  Priam  and his hapless Race  Have pour'd their Wrath on his devoted Head

Softness  To freeze his Veins and quench his manly Fires  The froward God of Love to boast his Pow'r  Has bred of late some little Jars between 'em  But 'twas my Care to reconcile their Follies  And

Dryads  Happy Companions of those Woods and Plains  Why was I forc'd to leave your chearful Fellowship  To come and lose my Peace of Mind at  Ithaca  And oh  Semanthe  wherefore didst thou listen  To that dear Voice why didst thou break thy Vow  Made to the Huntress  Cynthia  and her Train  Ah say fond Maid say wherefore didst thou love  Tel  Alas my gentle Love how have I wrong'd thee  By what unwilling Crime have I offended  That thus with streaming Eyes thou should'st complain  Thus dash my Joys and quench those Holy Fires  By yellow  Hymen  's Torch so lately lighted  Thus stain this

sooth my Soul with these sweet Hopes  Forget the Anguish of my waking Cares  And all those boding Dreams that haunt my Slumbers  Last Night when after many a heavy Sigh  And many a painful Thought the God of Sleep  Insensible and soft had stole upon me  Methought I found me by a murm'ring Brook  Reclin'd at Ease upon the flow'ry Margin  And thou thou first and last of all my Thoughts  Thou dear

lightly by us eager of the Sport  Last came the Goddess great  Latona  's Daughter  With more than mortal Grace she stood confest  I saw the Golden Quiver at her Back  And heard the sounding of her Silver Bow  Abash'd I rose and lowly made Obeysance  But she not sweet nor affable nor smiling  As once she wont with stern Regard beheld me  And wherefore dost thou loiter here she said  Of me thy Fellows and our Sports unmindful  Return thou Fugitive nor vainly hope  To dress thy Bridal Bed and waste thy Youth  In wanton Pleasures and inglorious Love  A Virgin at my Altar wert thou Vow'd  'Tis

turn'd my Eyes to thee  But found thee not for thou wert vanish'd from me  And in thy Place my Father lay extended  Upon the Earth a bloody lifeless Coarse  Struck to the very Heart I shriekt aloud  And waking found my Tears upon my Pillow  Tel  Vex not thy peaceful Soul my fair  Semanthe  Nor dread the Anger of the awful Gods  Safe in thy Native unoffending Innocence  Still when the golden Sun withdraws his Beams  And drowzy Night invades the weary World  Forth flies the God of Dreams fantastick  Morpheus  Ten Thousand mimick Fantoms fleet around him  Subtle as Air and various in their Natures  Each has Ten Thousand Thousand diff'rent Forms  In which they dance confus'd before the Sleeper  While the vain God laughs to behold what Pain  Imaginary Evils give Mankind  Sem  Not happy Omens that approve our Wishes  When bright with Flames the chearful Altar shines  And the good Gods are gracious to our Offerings  Not Oracles themselves that speak us happy  Cou'd charm my Fears and lull my froward Sorrows  Like the dear Voice of him whom my Soul loves  Ev'n while thou spok'st my Breast begun to glow  I felt sweet Hopes and Joy and Peace returning  And all the Fires of Life were kindled up anew  Tel  Hence then thou meager Care ill boding Melancholy  Anxious Disquiet and heartbreaking Grief  Fly to your Native Seats where deep below  Old Night and Horror with the Furies dwell

gaze on thee with Joy and yet I tremble  'Tis Pain and Pleasure blended both at once  'Tis Life and Death or something more than either  Tel  Thus untry'd Soldiers when the Trumpet sounds  Expect the Combat with uncertain Passions  Thus Nature speaks in unexperienc'd Maids  And thus they blush and thus like thee they tremble  At Even when the Queen retires to Rest  I'll meet thee here and take thee to my Arms  Thy best thy surest Refuge  But see the Stranger  Aethon  comes retire  I wou'd not have his watchful Eye observe us  Enter  Aethon  I charge thee loiter not but haste to bless me
