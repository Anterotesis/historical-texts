Martial Atchievements vol ii p  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR And Spoken by MR HARLEY  WHILE fears and hopes alternate thoughts suggest  And now disturb now soothe the Author's breast  While expectation breathes an awful pause  Ere yet the ready hand the curtain draws  Ere yet the action glowsI come a spy  To cast around a reconnoit'ring eye  Yet then as I this fearful Pit explore  Where Authors sometimes fall to rise no more  Here when th' Adventurer dares you to the field  If his fond efforts some small merit yield  I've seen your gen'rous arm forbear the blow  And raise to life and fame the grateful foe  For you the boist'rous inmates of the sky  Bold is the man who dares your pow'r defy  With you confusion her loud compact forms  You ride the clouds and are yourselves the storms  Yet have I seen you mitigate your rage  And spare the Adventurer struggling on the Stage  If in some scenes the rest tho' feebly done  Unerring Nature own'd her genuine Son  Your glowing soul has grasp'd the Author's cause  And hurl'd around the thunder of applause  For you ye glittering Amazonian train  Whose power is dreaded on the critic plain  Tho' marshal'd to the war by taste severe  Yet meek indulgence follows in the rear  And oft on beauty's cheek I've lov'd to trace  Soft stealing down the holy tear of grace  Rais'd by the thoughts these soothing hopes create  I'll bid the Bard come forth and meet his fate  The tyrant Terror from his breast erase  Rush on the scene and combat for your praise  CHARACTERS  SIR ALEXANDER SEATON  Mr POPE  ARCHIBALD  his Sons  Mr MIDDLETON

THE FIRST  Sir  ALEXANDER ARCHIBALD VALENTINE  SIR ALEXANDER  IT is not action only that adorns  The soldier's character it is patience  Calm and induring in the rugged hour  Of want that forms the nobler part of duty  You my lov'd sons and all your fellowsufferers  Have well that rigorous iron task perform'd  But now a smoother train of hours advances  The truce which at tomorrow's dawn takes place  Will enable me from out the northern gate  To dismiss the women the aged and the infirm  Then disencumber'd of its useless numbers  This foeencircled town shall raise its head  The hand of scarceness shall no more dispense  Her meagre morsel to th' exhausted soldier  But cheering competency shall provide  The meal  ARCHIBALD  'Tis well yet then inform me Sir  How you'll employ th' invaluable hours  That still precede the truce  SIR ALEXANDER  Our gallant men  Have been severely tried and worn with toil  ARCHIBALD  Their toilenfeebled bodies still enclose  The mounting spirit of unwearied vigor  VALENTINE  Prompt as the hawk to dart upon his prey  ARCHIBALD  The foe since yesterday appears to have lost  Half of his wonted intrepidity  VALENTINE  That show'r of arrows we pour'd down at eve  Hath somewhat quench'd their ardor  SIR ALEXANDER  Be it so  But tell me what is now your present purpose  Methinks that swelling to some bold design  Your bosom laboursSpeak my Valentine  VALENTINE  Command my elder brother Sir to speak  SIR ALEXANDER  Unfold then Archibald this mysterious something  This painful secret that disturbs you both  ARCHIBALD  Last night as we reclin'd upon our couch  Still talking o'er as is our wonted manner  The various hazard of the busy day  We wish'd we fondly wish'd that ere the truce  Should intervene some daring enterprize  Might be attempted under our direction  Thus we convers'd in sacred confidence  Till as our weak'ning voices died away  We wearied into rest'twas then an image  VALENTINE  Mark Sir what now my brother will unfold  ARCHIBALD  'Twas then an image rush'd upon my sight  It shew'd as one of the angelic train  A circling glory glitter'd o'er his head  A smile benignant beautified his lip  And thus he spoke'Sons of the valiant Seaton  Arise and hasten to the southern gate  Thence dart upon the foe'The vision ceas'd  And vanish'd into air while a rude noise  Like the fierce struggle of contending spears  Suddenly waked us Starting from my couch  And ere I cou'd communicate my dream  Valentine with impatient voice disclos'd  The mutual vision  VALENTINE  'Twas as he relates  By honor's winnow'd purity I swear  The nightly visitation also came  To me  SIR ALEXANDER  I hazard no impeachment of  Your truth yet then endearing children tell me  How can a prudent tender parent send  His valiant sons to danger's precipice  At the fantastic impulse of a dream  ARCHIBALD  In the old time we read that dreams have often  Been the prophetic leaders to success  VALENTINE  Oh do not Sir with caution's chill restraint  O'ershade the splendid purpose of our soul  ARCHIBALD  Let the bright vision be forgot if that  Offend you and attend to reason's voice  Does not the weary foe anticipate  Th' approaching truce and guard neglectingly  The southern gate  SIR ALEXANDER  'Tis a mask'd neglect  It is the couchant lion prompt to seize  Th' unwary preyah trust not to his stern  Repose  VALENTINE  If danger still must check the current  Of enterprize tell tell me Father wherefore  You rear'd us in the hardy school of war  ARCHIBALD  The road to martial glory well thou know'st  Is not gaysprinkled o'er with flowers but broken  Helmets shiver'd spears and bloodstain'd arrows  Choak up th' aspiring path of fame's ascent  VALENTINE  To be restrain'd when proud occasion calls  'Twere better thou hadst led me to some cloister  Where holy peace resides o'ercanopied  By antient roofs that ever shade her from  The madd'ning sunbeams of ambition's sky  SIR ALEXANDER  Forbear to torture thus a parent's feelings  ARCHIBALD  Indulgent Father rest assur'd we both  Pay homage to the thought that now disturbs you  But with th' experienced Melvil we have just  Conferr'd  SIR ALEXANDER  And he undoubtedly contemn'd  Your gaudy dream that meteor of the brain  VALENTINE  'Twas not the meteor of a heated brain  It was a sun  beam of revealing Heaven  It was the sympathetic glow of two  According minds  SIR ALEXANDER  Of this enoughWhat said  Th' experienc'd Melvil  ARCHIBALD  After due attention  To our proposal he first stamp'd it with  The seal of his applause and then added  Arguments that embodied as it were  Our enterprize and brighten'd it with the  Calm colouring of reason  SIR ALEXANDER  I will myself  Confer with Melvil and if he has words  To smooth the rugged doubts that vex my mind  Think not my valiant sons I shall withhold  You from the object of your bold request  ARCHIBALD  To keep unsullied the bright martial name  Of Seaton is indeed my proudest wish  VALENTINE  And if thy Valentine might add his mite  To the rich treasury of his Father's fame  He would be happy  SIR ALEXANDER  Wait till I return  Exit  ARCHIBALD  Excellent man his ardour to promote  Our cause and his solicitude about  Our safety combat and distract his will  VALENTINE  More active warm and forcible affection  Was ne'er embosom'd in a father's soul  And therefore much I fear that Melvil can't  Subdue his scruples  ARCHIBALD  Oft have I observ'd  That Melvil's clear illumin'd manly judgment  Possesses something like magnetic power  Which still attracts opinion to his side  VALENTINE  May that attractive power be at this moment  Endued with double influence that my Father  Withholding his restraint I might unbounded  Spring against the foeThis common praise  That's claim'd by every soldier ill supplies  My starv'd and craving appetite of fame  ARCHIBALD  Endearing Valentine think not that I  Reprove these flashes of an ardent mind  But should your mounting wishes meet controul  Wound not a Father's tender caution with  Reproach  VALENTINE  Sooner than wound his feeling mind  With sullen splenetic unduteous carriage  I wou'd like the Spartan boy who silently  Endur'd the gnawing fox conceal my sorrow  Though like the savage animal it should  Prey upon my vitals  ARCHIBALD  Consider also  This warlike age will gratify your wishes  With many a future enterprize The morn  Of life is now but breaking on thy youth  VALENTINE  Talk not to me of early youth behold  Edward's brave son whose age but equals mine  Oh were I equal with him in renown  Behold that boy on Cressy's wond'ring field  Reaping an immortal harvest while I  Enveloped in obscurity  ARCHIBALD  Desist  I hear some step approaching  Enter  DONALDSON  VALENTINE  'Tis my Father  Ah no 'tis Donaldson Say hast thou seen  The Governor  DONALDSON  I saw him as I pass'd by  In close conference engag'd with Melvil  VALENTINE  Know'st thou the subject of their conference  DONALDSON  There breathes an ignorant rumour of a sally  Propos seems by Archibald and you  ARCHIBALD  It is as you have darkly heard and here  Impatiently we wait the Governor's  Return  VALENTINE  See here he comes  Enter Sir  ALEXANDER  Hail to my Father  ARCHIBALD  Sir you appear disturbed  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah tell me Archibald  Is't with a look of cheerfulness a parent  Resigns his duteous children to the hazard  Of a fearful enterprize  ARCHIBALD  Yet then reflect  Melvil the military sage approves  The enterprize  SIR ALEXANDER  But Melvil has no children  His smooth sail of honour meets no adverse  Gales to check its progress'Tis not thus with me  Say how shall I endure the keen reproofs  Of Ethelberta when she is inform'd  That I have sent without the imperious call  Of stern necessity her darling children  To the path of danger  VALENTINE  Speak not of danger  'Tis the soldier's charter his best privilege  SIR ALEXANDER  Something withholds my full consent  And calls my judgment to severe account  Forgive this trembling caution in a parent  VALENTINE  Had England's warlike king suppress'd his son's  Ascending soul on her proud list of victories  We should not have found the name of Cressy  ARCHIBALD  'Twas on the summit of a neighb'ring hill  The father stood and saw his youthful son  Oppose the pride of France and when the Earls  Of Warwick and of Oxford sent a herald  To claim immediate succour from the king  VALENTINE  Did not the king reply Go tell the lords  Who sent you that while my boy 's alive  They will require my aid in vain the glory  Of this great day shall be his own  SIR ALEXANDER  Enough  Your arguments prevail and you have won me  To your requestGo join the skilful Melvil  The Nestor of the war and strictly mark  His words and wellweigh'd counselfirst receive  The anxious Father's blessing  Embraces his sons  May that Power  Who oft hath shielded me in many a combat  Oh may that guardian kind benignant Angel  Now hover o'er my children  Leads them to the door and returns  Donaldson  This is an awful moment for a Father  DONALDSON  Think not so deeply Sir nor feed your mind  With busy tort'ring vain surmises think  How often you've encounter'd perils imminent  And still return'd with glory  SIR ALEXANDER  Unavailing  Remembrance rear'd as I have almost been  In storms of battle say what paternal  Bosom will not feel a warm renew'd affection  For two such sons staged to the front of danger  DONALDSON  But should not Ethelberta be informed  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah there you probe my bosom's tender part  No Donaldson the mother must not know  The gathering storm that's brooding o'er her sons  Her quick'ning apprehension would outrun  The deed and picture to itself images  That would distract her'Tis my duty my  Religion still to shield her mind from all  That may assail it  DONALDSON  Many a time have  I listen'd to the splendid narrative  Of Ethelberta's virtues  SIR ALEXANDER  From the happy hour  I first call'd her mine unto this moment  She has with unremitting fortitude  Attended me through many a rugged day  DONALDSON  I think that England triumphs in her birth  SIR ALEXANDER  At those fam'd tournaments that Edward held  At Windsor did I first behold that matchless  Woman tho' attractive yet not dazzling  As looks the softer green amidst the radiant  Colours of the vernal bow so Ethelberta  Seem'd 'mid the circling flush of British beauties  This gorgeous castle and its proud delights  The daughter of Earl Nevil willingly  Resign'd to share with me the perils of  The late crusade This faithful Wife this soothing  Companion of my way still smooth'd the harrow'd  Walk of warEv'n as the wallflower rears its form  And smiles and flourishes 'midst tombs and ruins  So Ethelberta's warm affection grew  'Mid sickness want fatigue distress and danger  Enter  ANSELM  Hail holy father what dost thou report  ANSELM  With hasty step I come Sir to acquaint you  That the bold enterprize is well prepar'd  Along the subterraneous windings did  The gallant troops advance 'till they approach'd  The chapel of St Andrew near the gate  That issues to the field here paus'd the band  And then in sacred silence lowly bending  Dedicated themselves unto their country  SIR ALEXANDER  What follow'd  ANSELM  Then with solemn voice I utter'd  Warm from my throbbing heart the benediction  That is appointed in the hour of danger  SIR ALEXANDER  Yet tell me what directions then were given  ANSELM  It was agreed that your two sons attended  By a chosen few should rush upon the foe  While Melvil with a greater number should  Taking a wide circling path fall on the rear  Brave Melvil first began the silent march  Then did your sons lead forth their gallant men  Thro' the deep awful gloomthe signal for  The onset is to be the convent bell  That tolls at midnight  SIR ALEXANDER  Wherefore did I yield me  To their wild request Oh say is 't yet too late  The leave they wrested from me I may still  Recall  ANSELM  The die is cast and you must wait  Th' event yet elevate your mind to hope  For me I augur well of this bold enterprize  SIR ALEXANDER  But as a Father shou'd I not have been  More cautious more reserved  ANSELM  The sacred poet  Says Children are as arrows in the hand  Of a giant to perform his purpose  SIR ALEXANDER  Your words good Anselm animate my hopes  And lift me to my wonted confidence  In HeavenDid'st thou not say the convent bell  At midnight was th' appointed signal for  The onset  ANSELM  Ev'n so  SIR ALEXANDER  See Ethelberta comes  Farewell'tis meet that now ye both retire  Exeunt  Enter  ETHELBERTA  ETHELBERTA  I hope I'm no intruder if I am  My warm solicitude for you must plead  Indulgence  SIR ALEXANDER  Ever most welcome  ETHELBERTA  Methinks  You look all harass'd pale and overcome  Tis not surprisingbut I'm told the foe  Anticipates the truce by retreating  To some distanceWherefore do you not  Retire to rest 'Tis late 'tis almost midnight  SIR ALEXANDER  Midnight did'st thou say  ETHELBERTA  Sir you seem alarm'd  SIR ALEXANDER  What recent subject is there to alarm me  ETHELBERTA  Forgive my busy fond anxiety  That catches as it were at airy symptoms  Where are my sons tell me when I may see them  SIR ALEXANDER  I hope tomorrow  ETHELBERTA  Wherefore dost thou only  Hope Does not the truce take place tomorrow  What should then prevent  The bell tolls  Oh what transports you  'Twas but the wonted midnight bell that calls  The holy fathers to their pray'rs relieve  Relieve me from this painful ignorance  And let thine Ethelberta share the pang  That rends thy heart  SIR ALEXANDER  Dear Wife forbear to question me  ETHELBERTA  Will you not retire to rest for sure you  Need it much  SIR ALEXANDER  Perchance I mayDirections  Of highest import I have first to give  ETHELBERTA  Farewelldo not tarry longCare and sorrow  Mingle on thy browFarewellmy warmest  Blessing to my sons  Exit  SIR ALEXANDER  That blessing was pronounc'd  By her whose sons perchance are now no more  Enter  DONALDSON  Well Donaldson what hast thou to relate  DONALDSON  By some perfidious means the foe appris'd  Of the intended sally were prepar'd to meet  The troops that Melvil ledO'erpower'd by numbers  He and most of his brave train lie slaughter'd  On the plainAs for your sons  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah what of them  DONALDSON  In warmest combat they are now engag'd  SIR ALEXANDER  I'll fly to their assistance  Draws his sabre  DONALDSON  Let me first  SIR ALEXANDER  Cease your vain talking I must speed away  To save my sons or perish in their cause  Exeunt  End of the  FIRST ACT  ACT THE SECOND  Enter  ETHELBERTA  and  JULIANA  ETHELBERTA  SAY what can be the cause of their deserting me  I have not since the truce began beheld  The Governor nor have I yet embrac'd  My children they whose dutiful affection  I have until this present hour experienc'd  Whence comes it they defraud me of their cheering  Presence  JULIANA  'Tis business of some great moment  Perchance delays them  ETHELBERTA  Feed me not with vain  Pretexts their presence only can assuage  My starv'd and ravenous longing wild conception  Peoples the void of absence with many  Ghastly and terrific forms  JULIANA  Shall I withdraw  In order to investigate the cause  ETHELBERTA  No Juliana you must not desert me  I am too wretched and unfit for solitude  Why do you send your view to yonder portal  Juliana retires a few steps and then returns  JULIANA  Now cast away your fears behold behold  The Governor approaches  Enter  SIR ALEXANDER  ETHELBERTA  Your presence  Is as the sun unto the darken'd landscape  Wherefore hast thou linger'd thus Oh tell me  Where are my children  SIR ALEXANDER  They are well  ETHELBERTA  Yet why  Do they delay to bless a mother's sight  SIR ALEXANDER  'Tis proper now I should reveal  ETHELBERTA  Reveal  You've then some fearful secret to unfold  SIR ALEXANDER  Dear Ethelberta be not thus alarm'd  Already have I said our boys are well  Last night a sally was propos'd Archibald  And Valentine entreated much to lead  The onset  ETHELBERTA  And you yielded to their entreaty  SIR ALEXANDER  The subtle foe by some dark perfidy  Had early notice of the deeplaid scheme  And were too well prepar'd  ETHELBERTA  My blood runs cold  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah rather let it glow at my recital  Your sons have gain'd the warrior's best reward  Unsullied fame Three times did their small force  Drive back their triplenumber'd foes at length  By their encreasing powers subdued with nine  Of their brave men remaining they submitted  To be captives  ETHELBERTA  Say who first suggested  This rash enterprize  SIR ALEXANDER  Melvil applauded  What my sons propos'd and to the energy  With which he utter'd his approving thought  Did I reluctantly give my assent  ETHELBERTA  Curs'd be old Melvil for his rash approval  SIR ALEXANDER  Spare your resentment and revere the dead  Fall'n is his valiant arm to rise no more  ETHELBERTA  Then peace be to his soul Let me retain  A grateful sense to Heav'n that my lov'd children  Are not as Melvil number'd with the slain  The loss of those dear boys would be to me  As if the spring were blotted from the year  Come Juliana let us to our customed  Visitation of the sick and wounded  Exit  Ethelberta  and  Juliana  Enter  ANSELM  ANSELM  A herald from the foe is just arriv'd  And waits your orders for admission  SIR ALEXANDER  Let him be admitted  Enter  HERALD  THE HERALD  Sir this letter  Of high import I'm order'd to deliver  Into your hands only  SIR ALEXANDER  Retire awhile  In some few moments come for my reply  Reads to himself  ANSELM  Methinks you look disturb'd Say what can be  The drift of this important note  SIR ALEXANDER  Attend  reads aloud  "Complaints have reach'd me from my court as if  "I linger'd in subjecting your proud town  "To these complaints strong menaces are added  "I therefore summon you to surrender  "Or else your sons shall rue your stubbornness  "I will erect two pillars near the tower  "From whence your crowding arrows gall us most  "To these two pillars shall your sons be chain'd  "Expos'd to the whole tempest of the war"  ANSELM  The blackest fiend in hell conceiv'd that thought  And breath'd it on his mind  SIR ALEXANDER  I know him well  It suits the native disposition of the man  Enter  ETHELBERTA  ETHELBERTA  Ah wonder not I hastily return  I'm told a Herald from the camp is come  What tidings of my sons  SIR ALEXANDER  Peruse this note  She reads  ETHELBERTA  Say what dost thou intend to do  SIR ALEXANDER  My duty  ETHELBERTA  Is 't then a duty to destroy your children  To rend affection from your inmost breast  Uproot the thoughts of pity as they grow  Embowel nature of her hallow'd feelings  And to a mother dare you this avow  SIR ALEXANDER  I dare avow what honour bids me do  ETHELBERTA  The untam'd Arab who exists on plunder  Lets fall his booty to assist his child  But you whom polish'd manners should adorn  Whose pure religion wears a softer feature  Do you reject the impulse of compassion  For the stern morals of imagin'd honour  Enter  HERALD  HERALD  Sir the time urges what is your reply  SIR ALEXANDER  Go tell your savage and bloodthirsty General  The sacred oath I utter'd to my country  And to my royal master when I was  Exalted to the station I now hold  Contains my answerSir you may return  ETHELBERTA  Stay one short moment hear a mother plead  Tho' dead to pity riches may perchance  Allure his mind I've jewels of high value    Sir  Alexander  makes a signal to the  Herald  who retires    He goes he heeds not what I say my sons  Are then condemn'd without resource Enjoy    turning to Sir  Alexander  Enjoy this philosophic victory  This conquest this cold triumph o'er all feeling  Domestic pity conjugal affiance  Fatherly endearment are by you profan'd  SIR ALEXANDER  What does this mean dare you assert I do  Not love my children  ETHELBERTA  Say where are the proofs  Is yielding up your sons without a conflict  Without resorting to the prompt expedient  Affection wou'd have flown to Is resigning  Your sons without the interposing a short  Delay without a pause without inventing  Some pious artifice are these the proofs  Of your paternal kindness Evidence  Like this would not be admitted in the court  Of Nature  SIR ALEXANDER  Cease this idle declamation  Respect respect the great the solemn trial  To which my pure allegiance now is call'd  I see the desolating hour approach  Like the dark storm that thickens as it sails  It is the woman's privilege to weep  And utter her complaints to man belongs  The majesty of grief yet not the less  Does the fond parent warm this bosom  Ev'n while proud honour and relentless duty  Seem to command the function of my soul  I've that within that tells me I'm a father  ETHELBERTA  Thus the pale cheek of hungry fame is flush'd  And rudded o'er with the false glow of duty  ANSELM  Make not the bitter cup he's doomed to drink  Still more bitter by the infusions of reproach  ETHELBERTA  May not the brokenhearted mother speak  May not her madd'ning sorrow still attempt  To snatch her children from destruction  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  I come to pour glad tidings on your ear  Your sons  ETHELBERTA  What of my sons  OFFICER  They are return'd  Relenting as 'tis thought of his intention  The General has restor'd them to your wishes  ETHELBERTA  Ah tell me where you saw them  OFFICER  Ent'ring at  The southern gate amidst th' applauding multitude  They bade me hasten to your presence with  The news of their return  ETHELBERTA  Wherefore do they  Linger thus  OFFICER  Methinks I hear their footsteps  Enter  ARCHIBALD  and  VALENTINE  ETHELBERTA  What glorious vision meets my raptur'd eyes  Runs to embrace them  This sudden joy this unimagin'd heaven  Transports me beyond all pow'r of utterance  SIR ALEXANDER  Your presence my lov'd children smooths  The rugged conflict in my breastWhence comes  This change of counsel in the tyrant's mind  ETHELBERTA  Ah rather tell me where where is the joy  That ought to harmonise with ours Archibald  Your downcast look portends some dread intelligence  And you my Valentine where is thy wonted  Gaiety  ARCHIBALD  I have of high importance  Something to communicate to my Father  ETHELBERTA  May not I be present at the interview  ARCHIBALD  What I'm going to unfold will distress you  ETHELBERTA  No no your mutual safety is sufficient  To bear me up against this new calamity  But wherefore do you weep  ARCHIBALD  These tears I shed  Spring from affection not from fearI'll die  Worthy of such parents  VALENTINE  So will I  ETHELBERTA  Wherefore  Wherefore do ye talk of death  ARCHIBALD  With a mockery  Of pity does the General send us back  One of us must return to be the victim  Of his cruelty  ETHELBERTA  Oh never  ARCHIBALD  We're bound  By honour's tie the soldier's strongest chain  One must return and unappall'd we wait    turning to Sir  Alexander  For your decision  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah what Father can  Decide of two affectionate and duteous  Children which shall be led to slaughter Say  Was I to raise in awful thought the balance  Of my affection and cou'd judgment see  One side prevail still sacred nature's hand  Would join and equalize the trembling scales  VALENTINE    to  ETHELBERTA  Be comforted  ETHELBERTA  Oh my dear Valentine  Falls on his neck  ANSELM  I think all this is a mere stratagem  To lengthen out the truceAllow me Sir  To hasten to the General's tent there will  I urge with glowing words my suit  There paint the infamy that must involve him  If thus profaning the hallow'd feelings  Of Parents  VALENTINE  Holy father 'twou'd become  Thee better to assuage support with comfort's  Lenient voice this drooping mother than to  Interfere with what regards my brother's  Honour and my own  ETHELBERTA  I'll write to the General  In words of soothing power in terms of energy  Such as the mother's throbbing heart conceives  VALENTINE  No letter must be written for 'twou'd seem  Our dictating and would shew like cowardice  SIR ALEXANDER  There spoke my valiant son  ARCHIBALD  Our mutual dignity  Forbids abhors all interposition  ETHELBERTA  Then I have lost my children  VALENTINF  That follows not  He who is first in years in skill experience  He must be spar'd the general cause demands him  ARCHIBALD  What says the hasty Valentine  VALENTINE  Command  Your rising indignation I'll explain  Allow us Father for some few moments  To confer alone that free from all restraint  I may to Archibald disclose my mind  And utter arguments that may subdue  His reason to my ardent wish and thus  Prevent th' extinction of our family  ARCHIBALD  Perish to the root the name of Seaton  And let oblivion's night o'ershade the proud  Exploits of our long ancestry ere I  Consent to that which must degrade and shrink  Me in my own esteem  VALENTINE  I mean not that  SIR ALEXANDER  Come Ethelberta let us for a while  Retire and leave them to confer alone  ETHELBERTA  Well the high theme of your discourse I know  It is a contest for the palm of death  But in this glorious conflict still remember  What is due to your afflicted Mother  If any plan expedient or device  Allied to honour should suggest itself  If any beam should pierce this awful gloom  Admit its sacred influence on your mind  And save me from despair    Exit with  ANSELM JULIANA  and  SIR ALEXANDER  VALENTINE  Fear is no inmate of thy glowing breast  Yet then reflect that other thoughts than those  That courage breathes must sometimes regulate  A soldier's conduct Say hast thou not heard  That mercy resignation are the nobler  Duties of a soldier  ARCHIBALD  Where is now that  Mercy claim'd where call'd for mercy on whom  VALENTINE  Mercy on your Parents and on your country  ARCHIBALD  This puerile declamation moves me not  VALENTINE  I speak the language of a mind sincere  To one who is my friend as well as brother  For whom my partial fondness ne'er was doubted  ARCHIBALD  He loves me not who does not love my fame  Was I to yield to your illtim'd suggestion  Wou'd not each finger mark me as I pass  As one who skulks behind the privilege  Of eldership to save himself from death  I feel dishonour as I feel a wound  The fatal spot to which we both aspire  Is glory's prize is honour's awful station  And I now claim it as my sacred birthright  VALENTINE  I contend no longer  ARCHIBALD  Let me hasten  Fly to my Father to proclaim the news  That Valentine at length consents to live  VALENTINE  Allow me one short moment and be calm  Say wilt thou with an avarice of fame  Demand exclusively the meed of glory  Wilt thou pursue the path that leads to death  And leave thy faithful Valentine behind  ARCHIBALD  Cease generous brother or thou 'lt break my heart  VALENTINE  When first I quitted childhood's lowly vale  Eager with you I climb'd youth's arduous height  Whence greater scenes expanded onmy view  Still our pursuits consenting to one plan  Our lives like wedded streams united roll'd  And will you now disturb the sacred tide  And bid the kindred waves disparting run  ARCHIBALD  'Tis as you say in us was ever found  The sympathetic union of the mind  The harmony of affection and design  VALENTINE  And wou'd it not be sacrilege to tear  Our souls asunderMark my firm resolve  I will attend thee to the fatal spot  And share an equal destiny with thee  ARCHIBALD  I yield I bow to thy sublimer mind  VALENTINE  Let's haste away lest Ethelberta shou'd  Return and with her tears unman our purpose  ARCHIBALD  AgreedWe'll hasten to our mutual doom  Coequals at the hallow'd shrine of danger  VALENTINE  Will not the spirits of our valiant ancestry  Lean from their golden thrones on high well pleas'd  While thus  Encircling his brother  we march undaunted to our fate  One heart  ARCHIBALD  One cause  VALENTINE  One ruin and one fame  Exeunt  End of the  SECOND ACT  ACT THE THIRD  Enter  ETHELBERTA  and  JULIANA  ETHELBERTA  FLED to the camp Both fled Impossible  JULIANA  Pure honour breathing on their bosom  ETHELBERTA  Fled  Without one parting word  JULIANA  The great trial  They are call'd to claims their whole attention  ETHELBERTA  Has then the phantom glory steel'd my children  Into savagesNot one endearing  Word to soothe their fond afflicted Mother  JULIANA  The rigorous duty of their situation  ETHELBERTA  What duty is more pressing or more sacred  Than that a Mother claims It rises out  Of Nature's bosom summon'd by the voice  Of Heaven  JULIANA  Their better judgment held them from  Your presence well full well they knew the sight  Of two sons hast'ning to untimely death  Wou'd rend your heart  ETHELBERTA  It must be so it was  It was their love that urg'd them to avoid me  The cloud of dark surmise that here was gathering  Begins to melt in air and my full heart  Expands to all its wonted warm affection  JULIANA  To this affection join a confidence  That all may yet be well  ETHELBERTA  I dare not cast  A meeting glance upon th' approaching hour  Cou'd I but raise my sinking mind to the  Faint hope that the arrows haply might not  Reach my childrenThat the tyrant may  Relent of his fell purpose Vain endeavour  Each way I look I meet despairYet now  A thought possesses meIndulge my weakness  Ah pity the disease that flies to such  A remedyI've heard a skilful sorceress  Does in this town reside whose magic power  Unfolds the future to her trembling visitant  JULIANA  It is as you report and many a hapless  Virgin many a distressful mother  Have consulted her  ETHELBERTA  'Tis said she rivals  The weird sisterhood of ancient days  While o'er her mind pale prophecy hangs fluttering  The dread vauntcourier of futurity  Perchance this deeplyskill'd magician may  Transport my ignorant fears beyond th' event  JULIANA  Yet say was she by her exploring art  To raise your ignorant fears to horrid certainties  ETHELBERTA  Better to know the worse than thus to live  In apprehension unrelenting agony  Can'st thou inform me where the sorceress dwells  JULIANA  Her lonely cell is seen not far from hence  Amidst the ruins of an ancient cloister  Upon the burial ground There on a seat  Of ebony o'erspread with human skulls  She exerciseth her tremendous function  ETHELBERTA  Whence does the hag derive her daring mission  Is 't from on high or from the caves of hell  Does she not lift her impious hand to rend  The sanctuaryveil that hangs 'tween men and angels  And on the breast of heaven she sends a glance  Profane  JULIANA  This deep reflection will avert  Your anxious mind from its newform'd purpose  ETHELBERTA  Let me be wretched let me not be impious  Never will I tread the path that leads to  Her unhallow'd cellAnother thought occurs  Which meets my heart's consentCome come what may  I'll go in person to the hostile camp  There rushing on the rude barbarian  I will demand my children  JULIANA  Vain vain project  ETHELBERTA  He'll hear my plaintive voice he'll see these eyes  In tears  JULIANA  Th' unfeeling wretch will mock those tears  ETHELBERTA  Affection will endue my speech with eloquence  The monster self will soften at warm nature  Pleading for her darling sons  JULIANA  Consider  What dangers you'll encounter to what insults  You there may be expos'd 'tis likely you  May be detain'd a captive and immur'd  Within the precincts of a lonesome dungeon  ETHELBERTA  Talk not to me of dangers I despise them  Say hast thou not beheld the bold seaeagle  When her dear young one from the rock hath fall'n  Descend undaunted to the roaring main  Dash with her throbbing breast the waves asunder  To snatch the nestling from the ravenous shark  And would'st thou have me pause and hesitate  To act the mother's part Let us retire  And seek for Anselm to attend  And guide my footsteps to the tyrant's tent  Exeunt  Enter Sir  ALEXANDER  and  ANSELM  SIR ALEXANDER  Yes Anselm I confess I glory in  These childrentheir abrupt departure wakes  At once my wonder and delight Say has  It not a relish of the antique manners  Some proud resemblance of the Roman mind  ANSELM  This mutual dedication of themselves  To certain death will ornament our annals  SIR ALEXANDER  As torrents feed the river so my sons  Swell the strong current of my country's fame  ANSELM  You also share your part in this sublime  Transaction  SIR ALEXANDER  The renown is their's and mine  Is the distressMy scene in this deep drama  Is to bid my archers shoot their arrows  Where my defenceless sons will be expos'd  To their full rageAlas I fear good father  I have not virtue equal to the task  ANSELM  Virtue is ever found superior to  The rugged task and like the waterplant  Ascends still higher than the swelling flood  SIR ALEXANDER  Was ever father so severely tried  ANSELM  Image to yourself that you are acting  In sight of angels and immortal spirits  And thro' the scenery that darkens round  Look up as to the sun that breaks the cloud  Look up unto th' approving smile of Heav'n  SIR ALEXANDER  I sometimes think the tyrant will relent  ANSELM  He 's not of English birth  SIR ALEXANDER  Of that you may be certain  Humanity adorns the English soldier  It is the wholesome gale that ventilates  Their heart from the low subaltern up to  The royal youth who now in Gallia leads  His valiant band  ANSELM  From Norway is he not  This wretch who outrages a parent's feelings  SIR ALEXANDER  Ev'n soA pirate on the northern seas  His skill and matchless courage lifted him  To fame and being by distress of weather  Driv'n on the English coast the warlike Edward  Dazzled by his enterprizing spirit  Gave him to command the troops that now invest us  ANSELM  But tell me has your sons' abrupt departure  Yet reach'd the ear of hapless Ethelberta  SIR ALEXANDER  I know not thatI must not now approach  Her presence her unbounded sorrow would  Ill suit the frame of mind that I must now  AcquireGo holy father and dispense  The balm of comfort to her bleeding soul  I must confer with Donaldson  Exit  ANSELM  Enter  DONALDSON  DONALDSON  Your commands have been attended to and  Now the town is disencumber'd of its  NumbersThe wide northern gate recoiling  Pour'd forth a length'ning trainThe aged warriors  Pass'd on in mournful silenceThis dismission  Which mark'd their inutility appear'd  To humble and degrade them  SIR ALEXANDER  'Tis a cruel  But necessary order on my part  Yet then these aged and once active men  May haply in a few short days return  And then resume their wonted occupations  Habits and customs which they now forego  But never shall I meet with comfort more  My sons my sons  DONALDSON  Next in long order mov'd  A female band while many a pensive wife  Threw back a frequent glance of fond regard  SIR ALEXANDER  'Tis wellYour diligence demands my thanks  The truce will in two hours expireI must  Prepare me for the sad the solemn task  Imperious duty has impos'd upon me  'Tis time the men ascend th' embattled walls  In act to hurl the arrowy war below  DONALDSON  I left the men assembling in the square  SIR ALEXANDER  Oh wou'd that with the safety of this town  Which to my latest moment I'll defend  I might include the safety of my children  Exit  SCENE  the Enemy's Camp  Enter  ETHELBERTA  and  ANSELM  SENTINEL  to  ETHELBERTA  Arrest your daring footsteps  ETHELBERTA  Your uplifted  Weapon frights not her to whose misfortunes  Death were welcomeI am Ethelberta  The Sentinel returns the sabre into the scabbard  Haply in some far distant hamlet sits  Your mother brooding o'er your absence all  In tears Oh think of her and lead me to  My sons  SENTINEL  Beneath you tent the captive youths  Abide  ETHELBERTA  Inform your General that the wretched  Ethelberta humbly begs an audience  Exit  Sentinel    As  ETHELBERTA  and  ANSELM  approach the tent  ARCHIBALD  and  VALENTINE  rush out    ETHELBERTA  Marvel not at my appearance my bleeding  Bosom demanded this sad interview  ARCHIBALD  We're ever bound to you for this new proof  Of your affection  VALENTINE  Have you seen the General  ETHELBERTA  I've ask'd a conferenceI wait the answer  VALENTINE  Be sure you let him know that we did not  Urge or prompt you to demand an audience  ETHELBERTA  Is it then criminal in me to own  A Mother's feelings  ARCHIBALD  It is beneath the dignity  Of Ethelberta to confer with him  ETHELBERTA  Say what dignity belongs to a wretch  Like me  VALENTINE  His ear is steel'd against compassion  Nor do we wish to live  ETHELBERTA  Why Valentine  This contempt of life would you not live to  Save me from distractionIs the cruelty  That breathes within the General's tent  Contagious are my children grown insensible  To their afflicted mother  VALENTINE  Embracing her knees  Think not so  Unjustly of us  ETHELBERTA  Oh I think you both  Love me or I shou'd wish to be the dust  Beneath your feet  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  The General now in council  Waits your attendance  Exeunt  ETHELBERTA ANSELM  and  OFFICER  VALENTINE  Sooner would the seacliff  Stoop to the sinking mariner than will  The tyrant bend to her imploring voice  I mean his mercy will not reach us both  What if Ethelberta shou'd return and  Bring with her commands for your releasement  ARCHIBALD  I wou'd reject the despicable mercy  Has not our mutual vow to Heav'n ascended  Yes brother both must be releas'd or both  Consign'd to death  Enter  OFFICER  OFFICER  The General bids me lead  You to the fatal spot with orders that  You should immediately be fasten'd to  The summit of the pillars  ARCHIBALD  and  VALENTINE  We obey  Exeunt  SCENE  The place where pillars are erected men with ropes c  FIRST MAN  I relish not this barb'rous employment  It pains me to behold these ligaments  With which we soon must bind the valiant youths  SECOND MAN  'Tis said the Mother now is with the General  Imploring for her sons  FIRST MAN  I fear in vain  Behold they now approach  Enter  ARCHIBALD VALENTINE OFFICER  and  SOLDIERS  With great reluctance  Do I perform this office  ARCHIBALD  My good friend  Discharge your duty leave the rest to Heaven  ETHELBERTA  behind the scenes  Lead lead me to those dear unfortunate sons  Enter  ETHELBERTA  and  ANSELM  ETHELBERTA  Inhuman wretches check your dreadful office  This sight appals me  ARCHIBALD  Still oh still be comforted  We suffer more for your sake than our own  ETHELBERTA  Was it for this I rear'd you with such care  Was it for this I watch'd your waking virtues  And kindled at the dawn of your celestial mind  VALENTINE  We were born to die  ETHELBERTA  Had gradual illness  Stol'n on you as ye faded in my arms  Or had ye fall'n in battle then I shou'd  Like many many more unfortunate mothers  Have mournfully submitted but this outrage  This indignity  VALENTINE  Affects me not I am  Proud to fall in such a cause  ETHELBERTA  to  ANSELM  Did I not  Fall at the tyrant's feet did I not bathe  Them with my tears Like the unheeding rock  He stood unmov'd The stranger Pity knew not  The dark avenue to his heart  ANSELM  The king of terrors  Death comes like a friendly angel  In a noble cause  ARCHIBALD  'Tis as the holy  Father says The cause for which we die brightens  The darken'd hour it is the cause that dignifies  Those ignominious instruments that turns  These fatal pillars into pyramids  Proclaiming our eternal fame  ETHELBERTA  Who would  Not glory in such children Yes ye are  My boast my honour my delight I first led  Your infant footsteps to the path of virtue  Indulge the fond idea haply this  Sublime enthusiasm flows from me  VALENTINE  Speak ever thus and be the Heroine  Of this conflicting hour  ARCHIBALD  Methought as thus  You spoke a current of new ardour gush'd  Upon my throbbing heart  ETHELBERTA  Be not deceiv'd  The momentary gleam of triumph's past  To glory's touch succeeds tormenting fear  And Nature gives me up to grief again  Enter  OFFICER  OFFICER  The General bids me urge you to retire  ETHELBERTA  Does he prohibit this short interview  This last dear horror of a sad farewell    Leans overpower'd upon  ANSELM  OFFICER  The General also says that one of these  Youths may return and that the choice remains  With you  ETHELBERTA  suddenly raising up her head  Ah were I to absolve the life  Of one say by that act should I not condemn  The other to the fate that threatens him  OFFICER  Reflect that by these means you will prevent  Th' entire extinction of your name  ETHELBERTA  Your reasoning  Touches not a mother's breastWhile I behold  My sons as now they stand before me and  Recal their virtues their invariable  Affection tow'rds their mother and the concord  Of their congenial minds the interweaving  Harmony of colouring that composes  The texture of their mutual life my heart  Blends and unites the two and my fond eyes  Behold but one dear son  ARCHIBALD  and  VALENTINE  throw themselves at her feet while  ETHELBERTA  hangs over them    ARCHIBALD  rising  Kind pitying father  We intrust her to your care Oh comfort her  ANSELM  Mark this hallow'd symbol of our dread belief  Holding up the cross that hangs at his side  By this I swear I will administer  To her relief and wait upon her sorrow  And shed upon the fest'ring wound of grief  That Gilead balm Religion only can  Supply from thence alone can comfort flow  ETHELBERTA  Who talks of comfort Say will not these pillars  Rise to my mind in every place to frighten  Comfort from me In such a state comfort  Wou'd be impiety leave leave me with  Despair Oh would to Heav'n that in this conflict  Of life and sorrow sorrow might prevail  That I might fall deathsmitten on this spot  And in one grave be buried with my sons  OFFICER  The time expires the truce will shortly end  The war will be renew'd and from you town  The arrows then will fly  ETHELBERTA  To pierce my children  Tort'ring madness harbours in the thought  OFFICER  That devious pathway leads not to the town  ETHELBERTA  Forgive I was a moment scarce myself  And still a dimness hangs across my sight  Where are my sons  they go up to her  Forbear forbear to weep  I see my presence but enfeebles them  Tis cruelty to linger then resolv'd  I tear myself away Oh God of mercy  Spread o'er my children thy protecting shield  Exit with  ANSELM  End of the  THIRD ACT  ACT THE FOURTH  SCENE  The Archers mounted on the walls expecting the word of command  Enter  SIR ALEXANDER JULIANA DONALDSON  SIR ALEXANDER  to  DONALDSON  TO your command do I entrust those archers  I'll thro' the subterraneous passage with  A chosen number issue on the plain  My bosom burns to meet the tyrant and  Provoke him to a single combat How  Is he distinguish'd  DONALDSON  A bright scarlet mantle  Floats around his armour  SIR ALEXANDER  The impulse of an  Injur'd Father will add vigor to this arm  But Ethelberta is not yet return'd  DONALDSON  Her visit to the camp surprizes me  SIR ALEXANDER  It moves not my surprize for when th' affections  Of her soul are rous'd no fear no danger  JULIANA  She comesmark how her tortur'd mind speaks thro'  Th' expressive eye  Enter  ETHELBERTA  and  ANSELM  ETHELBERTA  I've spoke in vain  SIR ALEXANDER  I do  Not yet believe he will proceed to such  Extreme barbarity  ETHELBERTA  I saw the pillars  I saw the men with chains and instruments  Prepar'd Ere now your sons are bound to the  Lofty pillars with their bosoms bare to catch  The arrows which these men are now in act  To shoot and only wait your terrible  Command  SIR ALEXANDER  Ah leave me then to my dread duty  Retire RetireThe truce is just expiring  The trembling sands have almost  Run their hour  ETHELBERTA  kneeling  See at your feet the Mother of your children  Who thro' th' unvaried course of long attachment  Has shewn she's not unworthy of your choice  Oh how I glory'd in that day when first  You call'd me yours and do I live to curse  That day  SIR ALEXANDER  Rise Ethelberta cease entreating  Awake each virtue that surrounds your heart  Elevate your mind and dare to meet the  Approaching trial think that now you stand  As in a solemn temple and forbear  With vain complaining accents to disturb  The awful service that is now beginning  ETHELBERTA  These proud exalted sentiments suit well  The breast that's fed with glory's turgid vapour  My simple heart feels nothing but affection  SIR ALEXANDER  Would'st have me be a traitor do my country  ETHELBERTA  Dar'st thou assume the sacred name of Father  And can'st thou unappall'd behold that scene  SIR ALEXANDER  The voice that dares dissuade me from my duty  Is to my careless ear an empty sound  Mark me Ethelberta I'll not disgrace  The school of war in which I have been train'd  My parting soul shall fly unsullied  Into the bosom of my ancestry  And at my death my honour be convey'd  Immaculate into the ashes

where the pillars are erected where Sir  ALEXANDER  meets the General  SIR ALEXANDER  Well met my childrens' blood cries out revenge  New youthful vigor gushes on my breast  And vengeance like th' exterminating angel  Rides on this sword  They fight the General falls  Enter  ETHELBERTA  Your sons are now aveng'd  See Ethelberta where the monster lies  ETHELBERTA  'Tis nobly done now thou'rt indeed a Father  But gaudy exultation ill becomes us  The dreaded pillars we have not survey'd  I'll hasten to the spot and dare th' event  they go to the pillars  No children meet these fond enquiring eyes  SIR ALEXANDER  It seems as he relented of his purpose  ETHELBERTA  My heart presageful scorns the flatt'ring hope  Mark how the pillars are o'erspread with arrows  And some that strew the ground are stain'd with blood  Takes up one and advances towards the stage  This dread informer tells a horrid tale  Shouts at a distance  Whence that tumultuous noise  SIR ALEXANDER  Haply my valiant  Men are now returning from their victory  ETHELBERTA  What's victory to me without my sons    Nearer shouts then the troops enter with  ARCHIBALD  and  VALENTINE  Transporting sight I'm well repaid for all  The heartpangs of this agonizing day  SIR ALEXANDER  How did ye escape the flight of arrows  That wing'd from yonder losty battlements  ARCHIBALD  Chain'd to the pillars to our doom resign'd  We saw the angry weapons fly around  VALENTINE  Yet then beneath the spreading canopy  Of danger still did we remain untouch'd  ETHELBERTA  Some hov'ring angel with benignant hand  Averted from your breast the crowding darts  Yet tell me all Oh say by what bless'd means  Am I become the happiest of mothers  VALENTINE  As the enemy retreated from the walls  Orders were issued shou'd we be alive  To drag us back again in chains as captives  But our bold troops with hasty step advancing  By the resistless effort of Donaldson  We are restor'd to safety and to you  ETHELBERTA  to
