A NEW EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR T DAVIES RUSSELSTREET COVENTGARDEN J RIDLEY ST JAMES'SSTREET W FLEXNEY HOLBORN J SEWEL CORNHILL AND G KEARSLEY FLEETSTREET  TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY  JOSEPH THE SECOND  EMPEROR OF GERMANY  SIR  WHEN I compiled this little volume from the writings of one of the first ornaments of Britain and of human genius I did not look out long for a protector for the inestimable treasure To whom said all the powers of Feeling kindling within meto whom should these pages that breathe the spirit of humanity in such a supereminent degree be addressed but to that illustrious Monarch whose benignity and unparalelled philanthropy has given a charm to every enlightened quarter of the universe  When your Majesty retires from the busy scenes of Royalty to commune with nature and  her eminent works of which study your distinguished actions speak you an admirable proficient this volume will prove itself an entertaining and excellent companion  I rejoice in this opportunity of testifying my respect for such transcendent goodness and believe me to be with the most profound zeal  Sir  Your Majesty's most Obedient and most Devoted Humble Servant W H  London    Feb    PREFACE  A SELECTION of the Beauties of  Sterne  is what has been looked for by a number of his admirers for some time well knowing they would form such a Volume as perhaps this nor any other language could equal Indeed it was highly necessary on a particular score to make this selection the  chaste  lovers of literature were not only deprived themselves of the pleasure and instruction so conspicuous in this magnificent assemblage of Genius but their rising offspring whose minds it would polish to the highest perfection were prevented from tasting the enjoyment likewise The  chaste  part of the world complained so loudly of the obscenity which taints the writings of  Sterne  and indeed with some reason that those readers under their immediate inspection were not suffered to penetrate beyond the titlepage of his  Tristram Shandy  his  Sentimental Journey  in some degree escaped the general censure though that is not entirely free of the fault complained of  To accommodate those who are strangers to the first of these works I have I hope with some degree of judgment extracted the most distinguished passages on which the sun of Genius shines so resplendent that all his competitors in his manner of writing are lost in an eclipse of affectation and unnatural rhapsody I intended to have arranged them alphabetically till I found the stories of  Le Fever  the  Monk  and  Maria  would be too closely connected for the  feeling reader  and would wound the bosom of  sensibility  too deeply I therefore placed them at a proper distance from each otherI need not explain my motive for introducing the Sermon on the abuses of Conscience with the effusions of humanity throughout it every parent and governor I believe unless a bigotted Papist will thank meI wish I could insuse the pleasure that attended me in compiling this little work into the breast of the reader yet unacquainted with  Sterne  as it is I promise him the hours he may devote to this great master of nature and the passions will be marked with more felicity than any since genius led him to the love of letters  The Author's opinion of many parts of the  sacred writings  may with truth be applied to  a great part of his own that there is to be found in them  "Sublime and noble passages which by the rules of sound criticism and reason may be demonstrated to be truly eloquent and beautiful"  "There is something in them so thoroughly affecting and so noble and sublime withal that one might challenge the writings of the most celebrated orators of antiquity to produce any thing like them"  Before I conclude I cannot help observing with an excellent writer that  "there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without effect and which no fire of sentiment can agitate or exalt"  May such minds never violate the  Beanties of Sterne  but let them be while the virtues find sanctuary in the hearts of the amiabletheir amusement only  W H  CONTENTS  A  THE Ass  Page    The dead Ass

equally to my uncle  Toby  and  Yorick  to take this young creature out of these womens' hands and put him into those of a private governor  Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son as the mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night and by which he is to adjust his looks his carriage and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heartI would have one  Yorick  if possible polished at all points fit for my child to look into  There is continued my father a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts both in acting and speaking which argues a man  well  within  There are a thousand unnoticed openings continued my father which let a penetrating eye at once into a man's soul and I maintain it added he that a man of sense does not lay down his hat in coming into a roomor take it up in going out of it but something escapes which discovers him  I will have him continued my father cheerful faceté jovial at the same time prudent attentive to business vigilant acute argute inventive quick in resolving doubts and speculative questionshe shall be wise and judicious and learnedAnd why not humble and moderate and gentle tempered and good said  Yorick  And why not cried my uncle  Toby  free and generous and bountiful and braveHe shall my dear  Toby  replied my father getting up and shaking him by his handThen brother  Shandy  answered my uncle  Toby  raising himself off the chair and laying down his pipe to take hold of my father's other handI humbly beg I may recommend poor  Le Fever  's son to youa tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle  Toby's  eyeand another the fellow to it in the Coporal's as the proposition was madeyou will see why when you read  Le Fever's  story  THE STORY OF LE FEVER  IT was some time in the summer of that year in which  Dendermond  was taken by the allies when my uncle  Toby  was one evening getting his supper with  Trim  sitting behind him at a small sideboardI say sittingfor in consideration of the Corporal's lame knee which sometimes gave him exquisite painwhen my uncle  Toby  dined or supped alone he would never suffer the Corporal to stand and the poor fellow's veneration for his master was such that with a proper artillery my uncle  Toby  could have taken  Dendermond  itself with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him for many a time when my uncle  Toby  supposed the Corporal's leg was at rest he would look back and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect this bred more little squabbles betwixt them than all other causes for fiveandtwenty years togetherBut this is neither here nor therewhy do I mention itAsk my penit governs meI govern not it  He was one evening sitting thus at his supper when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand to beg a glass or two of sack 'Tis for a poor gentlemanI think of the army said the landlord who has been taken ill at my house four days ago and has never held up his head since or had a desire to taste any thing till just now that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast"  I think  " says he taking his hand from his forehead "  it would comfort me  "  If I could neither beg borrow or buy such a thingadded the landlordI would almost steal it for the poor gentleman he is so illI hope in God he will still mend continued hewe are all of us concerned for him  Thou art a goodnatured soul I will answer for thee cried my uncle  Toby  and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack thyselfand take a couple of bottles with my service and tell him he is heartily welcome to them and to a dozen more if they will do him good  Though I am persuaded said my uncle  Toby  as the landlord shut the door he is a very compassionate fellow  Trim  yet I cannot help entertaining  a high opinion of his guest too there must be something more than common in him that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his hostAnd of his whole family added the Corporal for they are all concerned for himStep after him said my uncle  Toby  do  Trim  and ask if he knows his name  I have quite forgot it truly said the landlord coming back into the parlour with the Corporalbut I can ask his son againHas he a son with him then said my uncle  Toby  A boy replied the landlord of about eleven or twelve years of agebut the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and dayHe has not stirred from the bedside these two days  My uncle  Toby  laid down his knife and fork and thrust his plate from before him as the landlord gave him the account and  Trim  without being ordered took away without saying one word and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  I have a project in my head as it is a bad night of wrapping myself  up warm in my roquelaure and paying a visit to this poor gentlemanYour honour's roquelaure replied the Corporal has not once been had on since the night before your honour received your wound when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St  Nicholas  and besides it is so cold and rainy a night that what with the roquelaure and what with the weather it will be enough to give your honour your death and bring on your honour's torment in your groin I fear so replied my uncle  Toby  but I am not at rest in my mind  Trim  since the account the landlord has given meI wish I had not known so much of this affairadded my uncle  Toby  or that I had known more of itHow shall we manage it Leave it an't please your honour to me quoth the CorporalI'll take my hat and stick and go to the house and reconnoitre and act accordingly and I will bring your honour a full account in an hourThou shalt go  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  and here's a shilling sor thee to drink with his servantI shall get it all out of him said the Corporal shutting the door  It was not till my uncle  Toby  had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe that Corporal  Trim  returned from the inn and gave him the following account  I despaired at first said the Corporal of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick LieutenantIs he in the army then said my uncle  Toby  He is said the CorporalAnd in what regiment said my uncle  Toby  I'll tell your honour replied the Corporal every thing straight forwards as I learnt itThen  Trim  I will fill another pipe said my uncle  Toby  and not interrupt thee till thou hast done so sit down at thy ease  Trim  in the windowseat and begin thy story again The Corporal made his old bow which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it  Your honour is good  And having done that he sat down as he was orderedand began the story to my uncle  Toby  over again in pretty near the same words  I despaired at first said the Corporal of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour about the Lieutenant and his son for when I asked where his servant was from whom I made myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be askedThat's a right distinction  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  I was answered an' please your honour that he had no servant with himthat he had come to the inn with hired horses which upon finding himself unable to proceed to join I  suppose the regiment he had dismissed the morning after he cameIf I get better my dear said he as he gave his purse to his son to pay the manwe can hire horses from henceBut alas the poor gentleman will never get from hence said the landlady to mefor I heard the deathwatch all night longand when he dies the youth his son will certainly die with him for he is brokenhearted already  I was hearing this account continued the Corporal when the youth came into the kitchen to order the thin toast the landlord spoke ofbut I will do it for my father myself said the youthPray let me save you the trouble young gentleman said I taking up a fork for the purpose and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire whilst I did itI believe Sir said he very modestly I can please him best myselfI am sure said I his honour will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old soldierThe youth took hold of my hand and instantly burst into tearsPoor youth said my uncle  Toby  he has been bred up from an infant in the army and the name of a soldier  Trim  sounded in his ears like the name of a friendI wish I had him here  I never in the longest march said the Corporal had so great a mind to my dinner as I had to cry with him for companyWhat could be the matter with me an' please your honour Nothing in the world  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  blowing his nosebut that thou art a good natured fellow  When I gave him the toast Continued the Corporal I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain  Shandy's  servant and that your honour though a stranger was extremely concerned for his fatherand that if there was any thing in your house or cellarAnd thou might'st have added my purse too said my uncle  Toby  he was heartily welcome to itHe made a very low bow which was meant to your honour but no answerfor his heart was fullso he went up stairs with the toastI warrant you my dear said I as I opened the kitchendoor your father will be well againMr  Yorick's  curate was smoaking a pipe by the kitchen firebut said not a word good or bad to comsort the youthI thought it wrong added the CorporalI think so too said my uncle  Toby  When the Lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast he felt himself a little revived and sent  down into the kitchen to let me know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairsI believe said the landlord he is going to say his prayersfor there was a book laid upon the chair by his bedside and as I shut the door I saw his son take up a cushion  I thought said the curate that you gentlemen of the army Mr  Trim  never said your prayers at allI heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night said the landlady very devoutly and with my own ears or I could not have believed itAre you sure of it replied the curateA soldier an' please your reverence said I prays as often of his own accord as a parsonand when he is fighting for his king and for his own life and for his honour too he has the most reason to pray to God of any one in the whole world'Twas well said of thee  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  But when a soldier said I an' please your reverence has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches up to his knees in cold wateror engaged said I for months together in long and dangerous marches harassed perhaps in his rear todayharassing others tomorrowdetached herecountermanded thereresting this night out upon his armsbeat up  in his shirt the nextbenumbed in his jointsperhaps without straw in his tent to kneel onmust say his prayers  how  and  when  he canI believe said Ifor I was piqued quoth the Corporal for the reputation of the army I believe an' please your reverence said I that when a soldier gets time to prayhe prays as heartily as a parsonthough not with all his fuss and hypocrisyThou shouldst not have said that  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  for God only knows who is a hypocrite and who is notAt the great and general review of us all Corporal at the day of judgment and not till thenit will be seen who has done their duties in this worldand who has not and we shall be advanced  Trim  accordinglyI hope we shall said  Trim  It is in the Scripture said my uncle  Toby  and I will shew it thee tomorrowIn the mean time we may depend upon it  Trim  for our comfort said my uncle  Toby  that God Almighty is so good and just a Governor of the world that if we have but done our duties in itit will never be enquired into whether we have done them in a red coat or a black oneI hope not said the CorporalBut go on  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  with the story  When I went up continued the Corporal into the Lieutenant's room which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minuteshe was lying in his bed with his head raised upon his hand with his elbow upon the pillow and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beside itThe youth was just stooping down to take up the cushion upon which I supposed he had been kneelingthe book was laid upon the bedand as he rose in taking up the cushion with one hand he reached out his other to take it away at the same time Let it remain there my dear said the Lieutenant  He did not offer to speak to me till I had walked up close to his bedsideIf you are Captain  Shandy  's servant said he you must present my thanks to your master with my little boy's thanks along with them for his courtesy to meif he was of  Levens's  said the LieutenantI told him your honour wasThen said he I served three campaigns with him in  Flanders  and remember himbut 'tis most likely as I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him that he knows nothing of meYou will tell him however that the person his good nature has laid under obligations to him is one  Le Fever  a Lieutenant in  Angus  'sbut he knows me notsaid he  a second time musingpossibly he may my storyadded hepray tell the Captain I was the Ensign at  Breda  whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket shot as she lay in my arms in my tentI remember the story an' please your honour said I very wellDo you so said he wiping his eyes with his handkerchiefthen well may IIn saying this he drew a little ring out of his bosom which seemed tied with a black ribband about his neck and kiss'd it twiceHere  Billy  said hethe boy flew across the room to the bedsideand falling down upon his knee took the ring in his hand and kissed it toothen kissed his father and sat down upon the bed and wept  I wish said my uncle  Toby  with a deep sighI wish  Trim  I was asleep  Your honour replied the Corporal is too much concernedshall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to your pipeDo  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  I remember said my uncle  Toby  sighing again the story of the Ensign and his wifeand particularly well that he as well as she upon some account  or other I forget what was universally pitied by the whole regimentbut finish the story thou art upon'Tis finished already said the Corporalfor I could stay no longerso wished his honour a good night young  Le Fever  rose from off the bed and saw me to the bottom of the stairs and as we went down together told me they had come from  Ireland  and were on their route to join the regiment in  Flanders  But alas said the Corporalthe Lieutenant's last day's march is overThen what is to become of his poor boy cried my uncle  Toby  It was to my uncle  Toby  's eternal honour that he set aside every other concern and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor Lieutenant and his son  That kind BEING who is a friend to the friendless shall recompence thee for this  Thou hast left this matter short said my uncle  Toby  to the Corporal as he was putting him to bedand I will tell thee in what  Trim  In the first place when thou madest an offer of my services to  Le Fever  as sickness and travelling are both expensive and thou knowest he was but a poor  Lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his paythat thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse because had he stood in need thou knowest  Trim  he had been as welcome to it as myselfYour honour knows said the Corporal I had no ordersTrue quoth my uncle  Toby  thou didst very right  Trim  as a soldierbut certainly very wrong as a man  In the second place for which indeed thou hast the same excuse continued my uncle  Toby  when thou offeredst him whatever was in my housethou shouldst have offered him my house too A sick brother officer should have the best quarters  Trim  and if we had him with uswe could tend and look to himThou art an excellent nurse thyself  Trim  and what with thy care of him and the old woman's and his boy's and mine together we might recruit him again at once and set him upon his legs  In a fortnight or three weeks added my uncle  Toby  smilinghe might marchHe will never march an' please your honour in this world said the CorporalHe will march said my uncle  Toby  rising up from the side of the bed with one shoe offAn' please your honour said the Corporal he  will never march but to his graveHe shall march cried my uncle  Toby  marching the foot which had a shoe on though without advancing an inchhe shall march to his regimentHe cannot stand it said the CorporalHe shall be supported said my uncle  Toby  He'll drop at last said the Corporal and what will become of his boyHe shall not drop said my uncle  Toby  firmlyAwello'daydo what we can for him said  Trim  maintaining his pointthe poor soul will dieHe shall not die by Gcried my uncle  Toby  The ACCUSING SPIRIT which flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath blush'd as he gave it inand the RECORDING ANGEL as he wrote it down dropp'd a tear upon the word and blotted it out for ever  My uncle  Toby  went to his bureauput his purse into his breeches pocket and having ordered the Corporal to go early in the morning for a physicianhe went to bed and fell asleep  The sun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but  Le Fever's  and his afflicted son's the hand of death press'd heavy upon  his eyelidsand hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circlewhen my uncle  Toby  who had rose up an hour before his wonted time entered the Lieutenant's room and without preface or apology sat himself down upon the chair by the bedside and independently of all modes and customs opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it and asked him how he didhow he had rested in the nightwhat was his complaintwhere was his painand what he could do to help himand without giving him time to answer any one of the enquiries went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the Corporal the night before for him  You shall go home directly  Le Fever  said my uncle  Toby  to my houseand we'll send for a doctor to see what's the matterand we'll have an apothecaryand the Corporal shall be your nurseand I'll be your servant  Le Fever  There was a frankness in my uncle  Toby  not the  effect  of familiaritybut the  cause  of itwhich let you at once into his souland shewed you the goodness of his nature to this there was something in his looks and voice and manner  superadded which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him so that before my uncle  Toby  had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees and had taken hold of the breast of his coat and was pulling it towards himThe blood and spirits of  Le Fever  which were waxing cold and slow within him and were retreating to their last citadel the heartrallied backthe film forsook his eyes for a momenthe looked up wishfully in my uncle  Toby's  facethen cast a look upon his boyand that  ligament  fine as it waswas never broken  Nature instantly ebb'd againthe film returned to its placethe pulse flutteredstopp'dwent onthrobb'dstopp'd againmovedstopp'dshall I go onNo  All that is necessary to be added is as follows  That my uncle  Toby  with young  Le Fever  in his hand attended the poor Lieutenant as chief mourners to his grave  When my uncle  Toby  had turned every thing into money and settled all accounts betwixt the  agent of the regiment and  Le Fever  and betwixt  Le Fever  and all mankindthere remained nothing more in my uncle  Toby's  hands than an old regimental coat and a sword so that my uncle  Toby  found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration The coat my uncle  Toby  gave the CorporaWear it  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  as long as it will hold together for the sake of the poor LieutenantAnd this said my uncle  Toby  taking up the sword in his hand and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spokeand this  Le Fever  I'll save for thee'tis all the fortune continued my uncle  Toby  hanging it up upon a crook and pointing to it'tis all the fortune my dear  Le Fever  which God has lest thee but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the worldand thou doest it like a man of honour'tis enough for us  As soon as my uncle  Toby  had laid a foundation he sent him to a public school where excepting Whitsuntide and Christmas at which times the Corporal was punctually dispatched for himhe remained to the spring of the year seventeen when the stories of the Emperor's sending his army into Hungary against the Turks kindling a spark of fire in his bosom he left his Greek and Latin  without leave and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle  Toby  begged his father's sword and my uncle  Toby's  leave along with it to go and try his fortune under EugeneTwice did my uncle  Toby  forget his wound and cry out  Le Fever  I will go with thee and thou shalt fight beside meAnd twice he laid his hand upon his groin and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation  My uncle  Toby  took down the sword from the crook where it had hung untouched ever since the Lieutenant's death and delivered it to the Corporal to brighten upand having detained  Le Fever  a single fortnight to equip him and contract for his passage to Leghornhe put the sword into his handIf thou art brave  Le Fever  said my uncle  Toby  this will not fail theebut Fortune said he musing a littleFortune mayAnd if she doesadded my uncle  Toby  embracing him come back again to me  Le Fever  and we will shape thee another course  The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of  Le Fever  more than my uncle  Toby's  paternal kindnesshe parted from my uncle  Toby  as the best of sons from the best of fathersboth dropped tearsand as my uncle  Toby  gave him  his last kiss he slipped sixty guineas tied up in an old purse of his father's in which was his mother's ring into his handand bid God bless him  Le Fever  got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made of at the defeat of the  Turks  before  Belgrade  but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment and trod close upon his heels for four years together after he had withstood these bussetings to the last till sickness overtook him at  Marseilles  from whence he wrote my uncle  Toby  word he had lost his time his services his health and in short every thing but his swordand was waiting for the first ship to return back to him  Le Fever  was hourly expected and was uppermost in my uncle  Toby's  mind all the time my father was giving him and  Yorick  a description of what kind of a person he would choose for a preceptor to me but as my uncle  Toby  thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required he forbore mentioning  Le Fever's  nametill the character by  Yorick's  interposition ending unexpectedly in one who should be gentle tempered and generous and good it impressed  the image of  Le Fever  and his interest upon my uncle  Toby  so forcibly he rose instantly off his chair and laying down his pipe in order to take hold of both my father's handsI beg brother  Shandy  said my uncle  Toby  I may recommend poor  Le Fever's  son to youI beseech you do added  Yorick  He has a good heart said my uncle  Toby  And a brave one too an' please your honour said the Corporal  The best hearts  Trim  are ever the bravest replied my uncle  Toby  T SHANDY VOL III CHAP  THE PULSE  PARIS  HAIL ye small sweet courtesies of life for smooth do ye make the road of it like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight 'tis ye who open this door and let the stranger in  Pray Madame said I have the goodness to tell me which way I must turn to go to the Opera ComiqueMost willingly Monsieur said she laying aside her work  I had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as I came along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption till at last this hitting my fancy I had walked in  She was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door    Tres volontiers  most willingly said she laying her work down upon a chair next her and  rising up from the low chair she was sitting in with so cheerful a movement and so cheerful a look that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her I should have said"This woman is grateful"  You must turn Monsieur said she going with me to the door of the shop and pointing the way down the street I was to takeyou must turn first to your left hand  mais prenez garde  there are two turns and be so good as to take the secondthen go down a little way and you'll see a church and when you are past it give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right and that will lead you to the foot of the  pont neuf  which you must crossand there any one will do himself the pleasure to shew you  She repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natured patience the third time as the firstand if  tones and manners  have a meaning which certainly they have unless to hearts which shut them outshe seemed really interested that I should not lose myself  I will not suppose it was the woman's beauty notwithstanding she was the handsomest Grisset I think I ever saw which had much to do with the  sense I had of her courtesy only I remember when I told her how much I was obliged to her that I looked very full in her eyesand that I repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions  I had not got ten paces from the door before I found I had forgot every tittle of what she had saidso looking back and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether I went right or notI returned back to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or leftfor that I had absolutely forgotIs it possible said she half laughing'Tis very possible replied I when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice  As this was the real truthshe took it as every woman takes a matter of right with a slight courtesy    Attendez  said she laying her hand upon my arm to detain me whilst she called a lad out of the backshop to get ready a parcel of gloves am just going to send him said she with a packet into that quarter and if you will have the complaisance to step in it will be ready in a moment and he shall attend you to the placeSo I walked in with her to the far side of the shop and taking up  the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair as if I had a mind to sit she sat down herself in her low chair and I instantly sat myself down beside her  He will be ready Monsieur said she in a momentAnd in that moment replied I most willingly would I say something very civil to you for all these courtesies Any one may do a casual act of good nature but a continuation of them shews it is a part of the temperature and certainly added I if it is the same blood which comes from the heart which descends to the extremes touching her wrist I am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the worldFeel it said she holding out her arm So laying down my hat I took hold of her fingers in one hand and applied the two sorefingers of my other to the artery  Would to heaven my dear Eugenius thou hadst passed by and beheld me sitting in my black coat and in my lackadaysical manner counting the throbs of it one by one with as much true devotion as if I had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her feverHow wouldst thou have laugh'd and moralized upon my new profession  and thou shouldst have laugh'd and moralized onTrust me my dear Eugenius I should have said "there are worse occupations in this world  than feeling a woman's pulse  "But a Grisset's thou wouldst have saidand in an open shop Yorick  So much the better for when my views are direct Eugenius I care not if all the world saw me feel it  I had counted twenty pulsations and was going on fast towards the fortieth when her husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop put me a little out of my reckoning'Twas nobody but her husband she saidso I began a fresh scoreMonsieur is so good quoth she as he pass'd by us as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulseThe husband took off his hat and making a bow said I did him too much honourand having said that he put on his hat and walked out  Good God said I to myself as he went outand can this man be the husband of this woman  Let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation if I explain it to those who do not  In London a shopkeeper and a shopkeeper's wife seem to be one bone and one flesh in the several endowments of mind and body sometimes the one sometimes the other has it so as in general to be upon a par and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do  In Paris there are scarce two orders of beings more different for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband he seldom comes therein some dark and dismal room behind he sits commerceless in his thrum nightcap the same rough son of Nature that Nature left him  The genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is  salique  having ceded this department with sundry others totally to the womenby a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a bag by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles and not only become round and  smooth but will receive some of them a polish like a brilliantMonsieur  Le Marli  is little better than the stone under your foot  Surelysurely man it is not good for thee to sit alonethou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings and this improvement of our natures from it I appeal to as my evidence  And how does it beat Monsieur said sheWith all the benignity said I looking quietly in her eyes that I expectedShe was going to say something civil in returnbut the lad came into the shop with the gloves  A propos  said I I want a couple of pair myself  The beautiful Grisset rose up when I said this and going behind the counter reached down a parcel and untied it I advanced to the side over against her they were all too large The beautiful Grisset measured them one by one across my handIt would not alter the dimensionsShe begged I would try a single pair which seemed to be the leastShe held it openmy hand slipped into it at onceIt will not do said I shaking my head a littleNo said she doing the same thing  There are certain combined looks of simple subtletywhere whim and sense and seriousness and nonsense are so blended that all the languages of Babel set loose together could not express themthey are communicated and caught so instantaneously that you can scarce say which party is the infector I leave it to your men of words to swell pages about itit is enough in the present to say again the gloves would not do so folding our hands within our arms we both loll'd upon the counterit was narrow and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us  The beautiful Grisset looked sometimes at the gloves then sideways to the window then at the glovesand then at me I was not disposed to break silenceI followed her example so I looked at the gloves then to the window then at the gloves and then at herand so on alternately  I found I lost considerably in every attackshe had a quick black eye and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration that she looked into my very heart and reinsIt may seem strange but I could actually feel she did  It is no matter said I taking up a couple of the pairs next me and putting them into my pocket  I was sensible the beautiful Grisset had not ask'd above a single livre above the priceI wish'd she had ask'd a livre more and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter aboutDo you think my dear Sir said she mistaking my embarrassment that I could ask a  sous  too much of a strangerand of a stranger whose politeness more than his want of gloves has done me the honour to lay himself at my mercy  M'en croyez capable  Faith not I said I and if you were you are welcomeso counting the money into her hand and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeeper's wife I went out and her lad with his parcel followed me  SENT JOURNEY PAGE  THE PIEMAN  SEEING a man standing with a basket on the other side of a street in Versailles as if he had something to sell I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for the Count de B***'s hotel  La Fleur returned a little pale and told me it was a Chevalier de St Louis selling  patés  It is impossible La Fleur said ILa Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself but persisted in his story he had seen the croix set in gold with its red ribband he said tied to his buttonholeand had looked into his basket and seen the  patés  which the Chevalier was selling so could not be mistaken in that  Such a reverse in a man's life awakens a better principle than curiosity I could not help looking for some time at him as I sat in the  remise  the more I looked at him his croix and his basket the stronger they wove themselves into my brainI got out of the  remise  and went towards him  He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees and with a sort of a bib which went half way up his breast upon the top of this but a little below the hem hung his croix His basket of little  patés  was covered over with a white damask napkin another of the same kind was spread at the bottom and there was a look of  propreté  and neatness throughout that one might have bought his  patés  of him as much from appetite as sentiment  He made an offer of them to neither but stood still with them at the corner of a hotel for those to buy who chose it without solicitation  He was about fortyeightof a sedatelook something approaching to gravity I did not wonderI went up rather to the basket than him and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his  patés  into my handI begg'd he would explain the appearance which affected me  He told me in a few words that the best part of his life had passed in the service in which after spending a small patrimony he had obtained a company and the croix with it but that at the conclusion of the last peace his regiment being  reformed and the whole corps with those of some other regiments left without any provisionhe found himself in a wide world without friends without a livreand indeed said he without any thing but thispointing as he said it to his croixThe poor Chevalier won my pity and he finished the scene with winning my esteem too  The king he said was the most generous of princes but his generosity could neither relieve or reward every one and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number He had a little wise he said whom he loved who did the  patisserie  and added he felt no dishonour in defending her and himself from want in this wayunless providence had offered him a better  It would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good in passing over what happened to this poor Chevalier of St Louis about nine months after  It seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers numbers had made the same enquiry which I had done  He had told them the same story and always with so much modesty and good sense that it had reached at last the King's earswho hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrityhe broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year  SENT JOURNEY PAGE  As I have told this to please the reader I beg he will allow me to relate another out of its order to please myselfthe two stories reflect light upon each otherand 'tis a pity they should be parted  THE SWORD  RENNES  WHEN states and empires have their periods of declension and feel in their turns what distress and poverty isI stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought the house d'E**** in Britanny into decay The Marquis d'E**** had fought up against his condition with great firmness wishing to preserve and still shew to the world some little fragments of what his ancestors had beentheir indiscretions had put it out of his power There was enough left for the little exigencies of  obscurity  But he had two boys who looked up to him for  light  he thought they deserved it He had tried his swordit could not open the waythe  mounting  was too expensiveand simple oeconomy was not a match for itthere was no resource but commerce  In any other province in France save Britanny this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wished to see reblossom  But in Britanny there being a provision for this he availed himself of it and taking an occasion when the states were assembled at Rennes the Marquis attended with his two sons entered the court and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy which though seldom claimed he said was no less in force he took his sword from his sideHere said he take it and be trusty guardians of it till better times put me in condition to reclaim it  The president accepted the Marquis's swordhe staid a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his house and departed  The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business with some unlooked for bequests from distant branches of his housereturned home to reclaim his nobility and to support it  It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a sentimental one that I should be at Rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition I call it solemnit was so to me  The Marquis entered the court with his whole family he supported his ladyhis eldest son supported his sister and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his motherhe put his handkerchief to his face twice  There was a dead silence When the Marquis had approached within six paces of the tribunal he gave the Marchioness to his youngest son and advancing three steps before his familyhe reclaimed his swordHis sword was given him and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almost out of the scabbardit was the shining face of a friend he had once given uphe looked attentively a long it beginning at the hilt as if to see whether it was the samewhen observing a little rust which it had contracted near the point he brought it near his eye and bending his head down over itI think I saw a tear fall upon the place I could not be deceived by what followed  "I shall find said he some  other way  to get it off"  When the Marquis had said this he returned his sword into its scabbard made a bow to  the guardians of itand with his wife and daughter and his two sons following him walked out  O how I envied him his feelings  S JOURNEY PAGE  THE ASS  I WAS stopped at the gate of  Lyons  by a poor ass who had just turned in with a couple of large panniers upon his back to collect eleemosynary turniptops and cabbageleaves and stood dubious with his two forefeet on the inside of the threshold and with his two hinder feet towards the street as not knowing very well whether he was to go in or no  Now 'tis an animal be in what hurry I may I cannot bear to strikethere is a patient endurance of sufferings wrote so unaffectedly in his looks and carriage which pleads so mightily for him that it always disarms me and to that degree that I  do not like to speak unkindly to him on the contrary meet him where I willwhether in town or countryin cart or under pannierswhether in liberty or bondageI have ever something civil to say to him on my part and as one word begets another if he has as little to do as II generally fall into conversation with him and surely never is my imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his countenanceand where those carry me not deep enoughin flying from my own heart into his and seeing what is natural for an ass to thinkas well as a man upon the occasionIn truth it is the only creature of all the classes of beings below me with whom I can do thisfor parrots jackdaws c I never exchange a word with themnor with the apes c for pretty near the same reason they act by rote as the others speak by it and equally make me silent nay my dog and my cat though I value them bothand for my dog he would speak if he couldyet some how or other they neither of them possess the talents for conversationI can make nothing of a discourse with them  But with an ass I can commune for ever come  Honesty  said Iseeing it was impracticable  to pass betwixt him and the gateart thou for coming in or going out  The ass twisted his head round to look up the street  Wellreplied Iwe'll wait a minute for  driver  He turned his head thoughtful about and looked wishfully the opposite way  I understand thee perfectly answered Iif thou takest a wrong step in this affair he will cudgel thee to deathWell a minute is but a minute and if it saves a fellowcreature a drubbing it shall not be set down as illspent He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on and in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unsavouriness had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times and picked it up againGod help thee Jack said I thou hast a bitter breakfast on'tand many a bitter day's labourand many a bitter blow I fear for its wages'tis allall bitterness to thee whatever life is to others  And now thy mouth if one knew the truth of it is as bitter I dare say as sootfor he had cast aside the stem and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a macaroonIn saying this I pulled out a paper of them which I had just purchased and gave him oneand at this moment that I am telling it my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroonthan of benevolence in giving him one which presided in the act  When the ass had eaten his macaroon I pressed him to come inthe poor beast was heavy loadedhis legs seemed to tremble under himhe hung rather backwards and as I pulled at his halter it broke short in my handhe looked up pensive in my face"Don't thrash me with itbut if you will you may"If I do said I I'll be dd The word was but one half of it pronounced when a person coming in let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil's crupper which put an end to the ceremony Out upon it cried I  TRISTRAM SHANDY VOL IV CHAP  THE SERMON  HEBREWS XIII    For we  TRUST  we have a good Conscience    "TRUSTTrust we have a good conscience"  Certainly  Trim  quoth my father interrupting him you give that sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and read it with such a sneering tone as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle  He is an' please your honour replied  Trim  Pugh said my father smiling  Sir quoth Doctor  Slop Trim  is certainly in the right for the writer who I perceive is a Protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up the apostle is certainly going to abuse him if this treatment of him has not done it already  But from whence replied my father have you concluded so soon Doctor  Slop  that the writer is of our churchfor aught I can see yethe may be of any churchBecause answered Doctor  Slop  if he was of ourshe durst no more take such a licencethan a bear by his beardIf in our communion Sir a man was to insult an apostlea saintor even the paring of a saint's nailhe would have his eyes scratched outWhat by the saint quoth my uncle Toby No replied Doctor  Slop  he would have an old house over his head Pray is the Inquisition an ancient building answered my uncle  Toby  or is it a modern oneI know nothing of architecture replied Doctor  Slop  An' please your honours quoth  Trim  the Inquisition is the vilestPrithee spare thy description  Trim  I hate the very name of it said my fatherNo matter for that answered Doctor  Slop  it has its uses for though I'm no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would soon be taught better manners and I can tell him if he went on at that rate would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains God help him then quoth my uncle  Toby  Amen added  Trim  for heaven above knows I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in itI never heard one word of it before said my  uncle  Toby  hastilyHow came he there  Trim  O Sir the story will make your heart bleedas it has made mine a thousand timesthe short of the story is thisMy brother  Tom  went over a servant to  Lisbon  and married a  Jew  's widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which somehow or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small children and carried directly to the Inquisition where God help him continued  Trim  fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heartthe poor honest lad lies confined at this hour he was as honest a soul added  Trim  pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warmed  The tears trickled down  Trim  's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them awayA dead silence in the room ensued for some minutesCertain proof of pity Come  Trim  quoth my father after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a little ventread onand put this melancholy story out of thy headI grieve that I interrupted thee but prithee begin the Sermon againfor if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou sayest I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given  Corporal  Trim  wiped his face and returned his handkerchief into his pocket and making a bow as he did ithe began again  THE SERMON  HEBREWS XIII    For we  TRUST  we have a good Conscience    "TRUST trust we have a good conscience Surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thingwhether he has a good conscience or no"  I am positive I am right quoth Dr  Stop    "If a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this accounthe must be privy to his own thoughts and desireshe must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life"  I defy him without an assistant quoth Dr  Slop    "In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains  hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth and with labour do we find the things that are before us  But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herselfis conscious of the web she has woveknows its texture and fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her"  The language is good and I declare  Trim  reads very well quoth my father  "Nowas conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives 'tis plain you will say from the very terms of the propositionwhenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands self accusedthat he must necessarily be a guilty manAnd on the contrary when the report is favourable on his side  and his heart condemns him notthat it is not a matter of  trust  as the apostle intimates but a matter of  certainty  and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also"  Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong I suppose quoth Dr  Slop  and the Protestant divine is in the right Sir have patience replied my father for I think it will presently appear that Saint  Paul  and the Protestant divine are both of an opinionAs nearly so quoth Dr  Slop  as east is to westbut this continued he lifting both hands comes from the liberty of the press  It is no more at the worst replied my uncle  Toby  than the liberty of the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever likely to be  Go on  Trim  quoth my father  "At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of manthat did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by  long habits of sin might as the scripture assures it may insensibly become hardand like some tender parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which God and nature endowed itDid this never happenor was it certain that selflove could never hang the least bias upon the judgmentor that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and encompass them about with clouds and thick darknessCould no such thing as favour and affection enter this sacred COURTDid WIT disdain to take a bribe in itor was ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment Or lastly were we assured that INTEREST stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearingand that Passion never got into the judgmentseat and pronounced sentence in the stead of Reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the caseWas this truly so as the objection must supposeno doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed itand the guilt or innocence of every man's life could be known in general by no  better measure than the degrees of his own approbation and censure"  "I own in one case whenever a man's conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation"  "But the converse of the proposition will not hold truenamely that whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocentThis is not factSo that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himselfthat he thanks God his mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good conscience because he hath a quiet oneis fallaciousand as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain factsyou see it liable to so much error from a false applicationthe principal upon which it goes so often pervertedthe whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to  produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account"  "A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principlesexceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justifya sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guiltrob her of her best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonourbut involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake Surely you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome lifehe can have no rest night or day from its reproaches"  "Alas CONSCIENCE had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as  Elijah  reproached the god  Baal  this domestic god  was either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke  Perhaps HE was gone out into company with HONOR to fight a duel to pay off some debt at playor dirty annuity the bargain of his lust Perhaps CONSCIENCE all this time was engaged at home talking aloud against petty  larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing so that he lives as merrily"If he was of our church though quoth Dr  Slop  he could not "sleeps as soundly in his bedand at last meets death as unconcernedlyperhaps much more so than a much better man"  All this is impossible with us quoth Dr  Slop  turning to my fatherthe case could not happen in our churchIt happens in ours however replied my father but too oftenI own quoth Dr  Slop  struck a little with my father's frank acknowledgmentthat a man in the  Romish  church may live as badlybut then he cannot easily die so'Tis little matter replied my father with an air of indifferencehow a rascal diesI mean answered Dr  Slop  he would be denied the benefits of the last sacramentsPray how many have you in all said my uncle  Toby  for I always forgetSeven answered Dr  Slop  Humphsaid my uncle  Toby  though not accented as a note of acquiescencebut as an interjection of that particular species of surprise when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing than he expectedHumph replied my uncle  Toby  Dr  Slop  who had an ear understood my uncle  Toby  as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacramentsHumph replied Dr  Slop  stating my uncle  Toby's  argument over again to himWhy Sir are there not seven cardinal virtuesSeven mortal sinsSeven golden candlesticksSeven heavens'Tis more than I know replied my uncle  Toby  Are there not Seven wonders of the worldSeven days of the creationSeven planetsSeven plaguesThat there are quoth my father with a most affected gravity But prithee continued he go on with the rest of thy characters  Trim    "Another is sordid unmerciful" here  Trim  waved his right hand "a straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship or public spirit Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer" An' please your honours cried  Trim  I think this a viler man than the other  "Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasionsNo thank God there is no occasion  I pay every man his ownI have no fornication to answer to my conscienceno faithless  vows or promises to make upI have debauched no man's wife or child thank God I am not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who stands before me  A third is crafty and designing in his nature View his whole life'tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all lawsplaindealing and the safe enjoyment of our several propertiesyou will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy manshall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life When old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscienceCONSCIENCE looks into the STATUTES at LARGEfinds no express law broken by what he has doneperceives no penalty or forseiture of goods and chattels incurredsees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his gates upon himWhat is there to affright his conscienceConscience has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law sits there invulnerable fortified with  Cases  and  Reports  so strongly on all sidesthat it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold"  The character of this last man said Dr  Slop  interrupting  Trim  is more detestable than all the restand seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst youamongst us a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long  blinded  three times in a year at least he must go to confession Will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle  Toby  Go on  Trim  quoth my father 'Tis very short replied  Trim  I wish it was longer quoth my uncle  Toby  for I like it hugely  Trim  went on  "A fourth man shall want even this refuge shall break through all their ceremony of slow chicanescorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purposeSee the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murdersHorridBut indeed much better was not to be expected in the present casethe poor man was in the darkhis Priest had got the keeping of his conscienceand all he would let him know of it was That  he must believe in the Popego to Masscross himselftell his beadsbe a good Catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven Whatif he perjuresWhyhe had a mental reservation in itBut if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent himif he robsif he stabs will not conscience on every such act receive a wound itselfAyebut the man has carried it to confessionthe wound digests there and will do well enough and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution O Popery what hast thou to answer forwhen not content with the too many natural and fatal ways thro' which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all thingsthou hast wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller too apt God knows to go astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is no peace"  "Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence If any man doubts the  reality of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himselfI must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart"  "Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand  there  tho' equally bad and vicious in their own natureshe will soon find that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give themand that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour"  "When  David  surprised  Saul  sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robewe read his heart smote him for what he had doneBut in the matter of  Uriah  where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honoured fell to make way for his lustwhere conscience had so  much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote him not A whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime to the time  Nathan  was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done"  "Thus conscience this once able monitorplaced on high as a judge within us and intended by our Maker as a just and equitable one tooby an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passesdoes its office so negligentlysometimes so corruptlythat it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations"  "So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled innamely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful subject to your king or a good servant to your God  call in religion and moralityLook what is written in the law of GodHow readest thouConsult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truthwhat say they"  "Let CONSCIENCE determine the matter upon these reportsand then if thy heart condemns thee not which is the case the apostle supposesthe rule will be infallible"Here Dr  Slop  fell asleep"  thou wilt have confidence towards God  that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself is the judgment of God and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions"  "  Blessed is the man  indeed then as the author of the book of  Ecclesiasticus  expresses  it who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him whether he be rich or whether he be poor if he have a good heart  a heart thus guided and informed  he shall  at all times rejoice in a cheerful countenance his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high  "  "In the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together which lawmakers are forced to multiply  Forced  as I say as things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by the many provisions madethat in all such corrupt and misguided cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us uprightto supply their force and by the terrors of gaols and halters oblige us to it"  I see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Templeor at some AssizeI like the reasoning and am sorry that Dr  Slop  has fallen asleep before the time of his convictionfor  it is now clear that the Parson as I thought at first never insulted St  Paul  in the leastnor has there been brother the least difference between themA great matter if they had differed replied my uncle  Toby  the best friends in the world may differ sometimesTruebrother  Toby  quoth my father shaking hands with himwe'll fill our pipes brother and then  Trim  shall go on  He read on as follows  "To have the fear of God before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrongThe first of these will comprehend the duties of religionthe second those of morality which are so inseperably connected together that you cannot divide these two  tables  even in imagination though the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both"  "I said the attempt is often made and so it isthere being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of  religion and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral characteror imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous" to the uttermost mite"  "When there is some appearance that it is sotho' one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive"  "Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependance upon his actions in matters of great distress"  "I will illustrate this by an example  "I know the banker I deal with or the physician I usually call in"  There is no need cried Dr  Slop  waking to call in any physician in this case  "To be neither of them men of much religion I hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt Wellnotwithstanding this I put my fortune into the hands of the oneand what is dearer still to me I trust my life to the honest skill of the other"  "Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence Why in the first place I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantageI consider that honesty serves the purposes of this lifeI know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their charactersIn a word I'm persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more"  "But put it otherwise namely that interestlay for once on the other side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secrete my fortune and  leave me naked in the worldor that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonour to himself or his artIn this case what hold have I of either of themReligion the strongest of all motives is out of the questionInterest the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against meWhat have I lest to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptationAlas I have nothingnothing but what is lighter than a bubbleI must lye at the mercy of HONOUR or some such capricious principle Strait security for two of the most valuable blessingsmy property and myself"  "As therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religionso on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality nevertheless 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man"  "He shall not only be covetous revengeful implacablebut even wanting in points of  common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the ageis zealous for some points of religiongoes twice a day to churchattends the sacramentsand amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religionshall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged truly his duty to God And you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of pietythough perhaps ten times more real honesty than himself"  "  This likewise is a sore evil under the sun  and I believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefs"  "For a general proof of thisexamine the history of the  Romish  church"  Well what can you make of that cried Dr  Slop  "see what scenes of cruelty murder rapine bloodshed"They may thank their own obstinacy cried Dr  Slop  "have all  been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality"  "In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or conditionand as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity he shewed none mercilessly trampled upon bothheard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses"  I have been in many a battle an' please your honour quoth  Trim  sighing but never in so melancholy a one as thisI would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor soulsto have been made a general officerWhy what do you understand of the affair said Dr  Slop  looking towards  Trim  with something more of contempt than the Corporal's honest heart deservedWhat do you know friend about this battle you talk ofI know replied  Trim  that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for itbut to a woman or a child continued  Trim  before I would level my musket at them I would  lose my life a thousand timesHere's a crown for thee  Trim  to drink with  Obadiah  tonight quoth my uncle  Toby  God bless your honour replied  Trim  I had rather these poor women and children had itThou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle  Toby  My father nodded his headas much as to sayand so he is  But prithee  Trim  said my father make an endfor I see thou hast but a leaf or two left  Corporal  Trim  read on  "If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficientconsider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to God by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to themselves"  "To be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the Inquisition"God help my poor brother  Tom  "Behold  Religion  with  Mercy  and  Justice  chained down under her feetthere sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal propped up with racks and instruments of torment Harkhark  what a piteous groan"Here  Trim's  face turned as pale as ashes"See the melancholy wretch who uttered it"Here the tears began to trickle down"just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent"Dn them all quoth  Trim  his colour returning into his face as red as blood"Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentorshis body so wasted with sorrow and confinement"Oh 'tis my brother cried poor  Trim  in a most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and clapping his hands togetherI fear 'tis poor  Tom  My father's and my uncle  Toby's  heart yearned with sympathy for the poor fellow's distress even  Slop  himself acknowledged pity for himWhy  Trim  said my father this is not a history'tis a sermon thou art reading prithee begin the sentence again"Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentorshis body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers"  "Observe the last movement of that horrid engine"I would rather face a cannon  quoth  Trim  stamping"See what convulsions it has thrown him intoConsider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretchedwhat exquisite tortures he endures by it'tis all nature can bear Good God see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips" I would not read another line of it quoth  Trim  for all this  world  I fear an' please your honours all this is in  Portugal  where my poor brother  Tom  is I tell thee  Trim  again quoth my father 'tis not an historical account'tis a description'Tis only a description honest man quoth  Slop  there's not a word of truth in itThat's another story replied my fatherHowever as  Trim  reads it with so much concern'tis cruelty to force him to go on with itGive me hold of the sermon  Trim  I'll finish it for thee and thou may'st go I must stay and hear it too replied  Trim  if your honour will allow methough I would not read it myself for a Colonel's payPoor  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  My father went on  "Cosider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretchedwhat exquisite torture he endures by it'Tis all nature can  bear Good God See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lipswilling to take its leavebut not suffered to departBehold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell"  Then thank God however quoth  Trim  they have not killed him  "See him dragged out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies which this principlethis principle that there can be religion without mercy has prepared for him The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of christianity'tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us for these and such like cases and it is worth a thousand arguments  By their fruits ye shall know them  "  "I will add no farther to the length of this sermon than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from it"  "  First  Whenever a man talks  dly against religion always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his CREED A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbours and where they separate depend upon it 'tis for no other cause but quietness sake"  "  Secondly  When a man thus represented tells you in any particular instanceThat such a thing goes against his consciencealways believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes  against  his stomacha present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both"  "In a wordtrust that man in nothing who has not a CONSCIENCE in every thing"  "And in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousandsthat your conscience is not a lawNo God and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to determinenot like an  Asiatic  Cadi according  to the ebbs and flows of his own passionsbut like a  British  judge in this land of liberty and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written"  END OF THE SERMON  T SHANDY V C  REMAINDER OF THE STORY OF TRIM'S BROTHER  AS  Tom's  place an' please your honour was easyand the weather warmit put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world and as it fell out about that time that a  Jew  who kept a saugage shop in the same street had the ill luck to die of a strangury and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade  Tom  thought as every body in  Lisbon  was doing the best he could divise for himself there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on so without any introduction to the widow except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop  Tom  set outcounting the matter thus within himself as he walked along that let the worst come of it that could he should at least get a pound of sausages for their worthbut if things went well he should be set up inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of sausagesbut a wifeand a sausage shop an' please your honour into the bargain  Every servant in the family from high to low wished  Tom  success and I can fancy an' please your honour I see him this moment with his white dimity waistcoat and breeches and hat a little o'one side passing jollily along the street swinging his stick with a smile and a cheerful word for every body he met  But alas  Tom  thou smilest no more cried the Corporal looking on one side of him upon the ground as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon  Poor fellow said my uncle  Toby  feelingly  He was an honest lighthearted lad an' please your honour as ever blood warm'd  Then he resembled thee  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  rapidly  The Corporal blush'd down to his fingers endsa tear of sentimental bashfulnessanother of gratitude to my uncle  Toby  and a tear of sorrow for his brother's misfortunes started into his eye and ran sweetly down his cheek together my uncle  Toby's  kindled as one lamp does at  another and taking hold of the breast of  Trim's  coat which had been that of  Le Fever's  as if to ease his lame leg but in reality to gratify a finer feelinghe stood silent for a minute and a half at the end of which he took his hand away and the Corporal making a bow went on with his story of his brother and the  Jew's  widow  When  Tom  an' please your honour got to the shop there was nobody in it but a poor negro girl with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end of a long cane flapping away fliesnot killing them  'Tis a pretty picture said my uncle  Toby  she had suffered persecution  Trim  and had learnt mercy  She was good an' please your honour from nature as well as from hardships and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless slut that would melt a heart of stone said  Trim  and some dismal winter's evening when your honour is in the humour they shall be told you with the rest of  Tom's  story for it makes a part of it  Then do not forget  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  A negro has a soul an' please your honour said the Corporal doubtingly  I am not much versed Corporal quoth my uncle  Toby  in things of that kind but I suppose God would not leave him without one any more than thee or me  It would be putting one sadly over the head of another quoth the Corporal  It would so said my uncle  Toby  Why then an' please your honour is a black wench to be used worse than a white one  I can give no reason said my uncle  Toby    Only cried the Corporal shaking his head because she has no one to stand up for her  'Tis that very thing  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  which recommends her to protectionand her brethren with her 'tis the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands  now  where it may be hereafter heaven knowsbut be it where it will the brave  Trim  will not use it unkindly  God forbid said the Corporal  Amen responded my uncle  Toby  laying his hand upon his heart  The Corporal returned to his story and went onbut with an embarrassment in doing it which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to comprehend for by the many sudden transitions all along from one kind and cordial passion to another in getting thus far on his way he had lost the sportable key of his voice which gave sense and spirit to his tale he attempted twice to resume it but could not please himself so giving a stout hem to rally back the retreating spirits and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm akimbo on one side and with his right a little extended supported her on the otherthe Corporal got as near the note as he could and in that attitude continued his story  As  Tom  an' please your honour had no business at that time with the Moorish girl he passed  on into the room beyond to talk to the  Jew's  widow about loveand being as I have told your honour an open cheary hearted lad with his character wrote in his looks and carriage he took a chair and without much apology but with great civility at the same time placed it close to her at the table and sat down  Now a widow an' please your honour always chooses a second husband as unlike the first as she can so the affair was settled in her mind before  Tom  mentioned it  She signed the capitulationand  Tom  sealed it and there was an end of the matter  T SHANDY V IV c  THE BEGUINE  SO thou wast once in love  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  smiling  Souse replied the Corporalover head and ears an' please your honour Prithee when whereand how came it to passI never heard one word of it before quoth my uncle  Toby  I dare say answered  Trim  that every drummer and serjeant's son in the regiment knew of itIt's high time I shouldsaid my uncle  Toby  Your honour remembers with concern said the Corporal the total rout and confusion of our camp and the army at the affair of  Landen  every one was left to shift for himself and if it had not been for the regiments of  Wyndham Lumley  and  Galway  which covered the retreat over the bridge of  Neerspeeken  the King himself could scarce have gained ithe was pressed hard as your honour knows on every side of him  Gallant mortal cried my uncle  Toby  caught up with enthusiasmthis moment now that all is lost I see him galloping across me Corporal to the left to bring up the remains of the English horse along with him to support the right and tear the laurel from  Luxembourg's  brows if yet 'tis possibleI see him with the knot of his scarf just shot off infusing fresh spirits into poor  Galway's  regimentriding along the linethen wheeling about and charging  Conti  at the head of itBrave brave by heaven cried my uncle  Toby  he deserves a crownas richly as a thief a halter shouted  Trim  My uncle  Toby  knew the Corporal's loyaltyotherwise the comparison was not at all to his mindit did not altogether strike the Corporal's fancy when he had made itbut it could not be recalledso he had nothing to do but proceed  As the number of wounded was prodigious and no one had time to think of any thing but his own safetyThough  Talmash  said my uncle  Toby  brought off the foot with great prudencebut I was left upon the field said the Corporal Thou wast so poor fellow replied my uncle  Toby  so that it was noon the next day continued the Corporal before I was exchanged  and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more in order to be conveyed to our hospitalThe anguish of my knee continued the Corporal was excessive in itself and the uneasiness of the cart with the roughness of the roads which were terribly cut upmaking bad still worseevery step was death to me so that with the loss of blood and the want of care taking of me and a fever I felt coming on besidesPoor soul said my uncle  Toby  all together an' please your honour was more than I could sustain  I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant's house where our cart which was the last of the line had halted they had helped me in and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp'd it upon some sugar and seeing it had cheer'd me she had given it me a second and a third timeSo I was telling her an' please your honour the anguish I was in and was saying it was so intolerable to me that I had much rather lie down upon the bed turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the roomand die than go onwhen upon her attempting to lead me to it I fainted away in her arms She was  a good soul as your honour said the Coporal wiping his eyes will hear  I thought love had been a joyous thing quoth my uncle  Toby  'Tis the most serious thing an' please your honour sometimes that is in the world  By the persuasion of the young woman continued the Corporal the cart with the wounded men set off without me she had assured them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart So when I came to myselfI found myself in a still quiet cottage with no one but the young woman and the peasant and his wife I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room with my wounded leg upon a chair and the young woman beside me holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my nose with one hand and rubbing my temples with the other  I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant for it was no innso had offered her a little purse with eighteen florins which my poor brother  Tom  here  Trim  wip'd his eyes  had sent me as a token by a recruit just before he set out for  Lisbon    The young woman called the old man and his wife into the room to shew them the money in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little necessaries I should want till I should be in a condition to be got to the hospitalCome then said she tying up the little purseI'll be your bankerbut as that office alone will not keep me employ'd I'll be your nurse too  I thought by her manner of speaking this as well as by her dress which I then began to consider more attentivelythat the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant She was in black down to her toes with her hair concealed under a cambrick border laid close to her forehead she was one of those kind of Nuns an' please your honour of which your honour knows there are a good many in  Flanders  which they let go looseBy thy description  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  I dare say she was a young  Beguine  of which there are none to be found any where but in the  Spanish Netherlands  except at  Amsterdam  they differ from Nuns in this that they can quit their cloister if  they choose to marry they visit and take care of the sick by professionI had rather for my own part they did it out of goodnature  The young  Beguine  continued the Corporal had scarce given herself time to tell me "she would be my nurse" when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one and prepare something for meand in a short timethough I thought it a long oneshe came back with flannels c c and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours and made me a thin bason of gruel for my suppershe wish'd me rest and promised to be with me early in the morningShe wish'd me an' please your honour what was not to be had My fever ran very high that nighther figure made sad disturbance within meI was every moment cutting the world in twoto give her half of itand every moment was I crying that I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with herThe whole night long was the fair  Beguine  like an angel close by my bed side holding back my curtain and offering me cordialsand I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promised and giving them in reality In truth she was  scarce ever from me and so accustomed was I to receive life from her hands that my heart sickened and I lost colour when she left the roomLove an' please your honour is exactly like war in this that a soldier though he has escaped three weeks complete o' Saturdaynightmay nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morningit happened so here an' please your honour with this difference onlythat it was on Sunday in the afternoon when I fell in love all at once with a sisserarait burst upon me an' please your honour like a bombscarce giving me time to say "God bless me"  I thought  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  a man never fell in love so very suddenly  Yes an' please your honour if he is in the way of itreplied  Trim  I prithee quoth my uncle  Toby  inform me how this matter happened  With all pleasure said the Corporal making a bow I had escaped continued the Corporal all that time from falling in love and  had gone on to the end of the chapter had it not been predestined otherwisethere is no resisting our fate It was on a Sunday in the afternoon as I told your honour The old man and his wife had walked outEvery thing was still and hush as midnight about the house  There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard when the fair  Beguine  came in to see me  My wound was then in a fair way of doing wellthe inflammation had been gone off for some time but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee so insufferable that I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it Let me see it said she kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee and laying her hand upon the part below itit only wants rubbing a little said the  Beguine  so covering it with the bed cloaths she began with the forefinger of her righthand to rub under my knee guiding her forefinger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing  In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second fingerand presently it was laid  flat with the other and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while it then came into my head that I should fall in loveI blushed when I saw how white a hand she hadI shall never an' please your honour behold another hand so white whilst I live  The young  Beguine  continued the Corporal perceiving it was of great service to mefrom rubbing for some time with two fingersproceeded to rub at length with threetill by little and little she brought down the fourth and then rubbed with her whole hand I will never say another word an' please your honour upon hands againbut is was softer than satin  Prithee  Trim  commend it as much as thou wilt said my uncle  Toby  I shall hear thy story with the more delightThe Corporal thanked his master most unfeignedly but having nothing to say upon the  Beguine's  hand but the same over againhe proceeded to the effects of it  The fair  Beguine  said the Corporal continued rubbing with her whole hand under my kneetill I feared her zeal would weary her"I would do a thousand times more" said she  "for the love of Christ" As she continued rubbingI felt it spread from under her hand an' please your honour to every part of my frame  The more she rubbed and the longer strokes she tookthe more the fire kindled in my veinstill at length by two or three strokes longer than the restmy passion rose to the highest pitchI seized her handAnd then thou clapped'st it to thy lips  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  and madest a speech  Whether the Corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle  Toby  described it is not material it is enough that it contained in it the essence of all the loveromances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world  T SHANDY VOL CHAP  MARIA  THEY were the sweetest notes I ever heard and I instantly let down the foreglass to hear them more distinctly'Tis  Maria  said the postillion observing I was listeningPoor  Maria  continued he leaning his body on one side to let me see her for he was in a line betwixt us is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe with her little goat beside her  The young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart that I instantly made a vow I would give him a fourandtwenty sous piece when I got to  Moulines  And who is  poor Maria  said I  The love and pity of all the villages around us said the postillionit is but three years ago that the sun did not shine upon so fair so quickwitted and amiable a maid and better fate  did  Maria  deserve than to have her Banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them  He was going on when  Maria  who had made a short pause put the pipe to her mouth and began the air againthey were the same notesyet were ten times sweeter It is the evening service to the Virgin said the young manbut who has taught her to play itor how she came by her pipe no one knows we think that heaven has assisted her in both for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind it seems her only consolationshe has never once had the pipe out of her hand but plays that  service  upon it almost night and day  The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition and should have sifted out his history had not poor  Maria's  taken such full possession of me  We had got up by this time almost to the bank where  Maria  was sitting she was in a thin white jacket with her hair all but two  tresses drawn up into a silk net with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one sideshe was beautiful and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heartache it was the moment I saw her  God help her poor damsel above a hundred masses said the postillion have been said in the several parish churches and convents around for herbut without effect we have still hopes as she is sensible for short intervals that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself but her parents who know her best are hopeless upon that score and think her senses are lost for ever  As the postillion spoke this  Maria  made a cadence so melancholy so tender and querulous that I sprung out of the chaise to help her and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm  Maria  look'd wistfully for some time at me and then at her goatand then at meand then at her goat again and so on alternately  Well  Maria  said I softlyWhat resemblance do you find  I do entreat the candid reader to believe me that it was from the humblest conviction of what a  Beast  man isthat I ask'd the question and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery to be entitled to all the wit that ever  Rabelais  scatteredand yet I own my heart smote me and that I so smarted at the very idea of it that I swore I would set up for wisdom and utter grave sentences the rest of my daysand nevernever attempt again to commit mirth with man woman or child the longest day I had to live  As for writing nonsense to themI believe there was a reservebut that I leave to the world  Adieu  Maria  adieu poor hapless damsel some time but not  now  I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lipsbut I was deceived for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it that I rose up and with broken and irregular steps walk'd softly to my chaise  T SHANDY VOL IV C  MARIA  MOULINES  I NEVER felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till nowto travel it through the  Bourbonnois  the sweetest part of  France  in the heyday of the vintage when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap and every eye is lifted upa journey through each step of which music beats time to  Labour  and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clustersto pass through this with my affections flying out and kindling at every group before meand every one of them was pregnant with adventures  Just heavenit would fill up twenty volumesand alas I have but a few small pages left of this to crowd it intoand half of these must be taken up with the poor  Maria  my friend Mr  Shandy  met with near  Moulines  The story he had told of that disordered maid affected me not a little in the reading but when  I got within the neighbourhood where she lived it returned so strong into my mind that I could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village where her parents dwelt to enquire after her  'Tis going I own like the knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy adventuresbut I know not how it is but I am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me as when I am entangled in them  The old mother came to the door her looks told me the story before she opened her mouthShe had lost her husband he had died she said of anguish for the loss of  Maria's  senses about a month beforeShe had feared at first she added that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little understanding was leftbut on the contrary it had brought her more to herselfstill she could not resther poor daughter she said crying was wandering somewhere about the road  Why does my pulse beat languid as I write this and what made  La Fleur  whose heart  seemed only to be tun'd to joy to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes as the woman stood and told it I beckoned to the postillion to turn back into the road  When we had got within half a league of  Moulines  at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket I discovered poor  Maria  sitting under a poplarshe was sitting with her elbow in her lap and her head leaning on one side within her handa small brook ran at the foot of the tree  I bid the postillion go on with the chaise to  Moulines  and  La Fleur  to bespeak my supperand that I would walk after him  She was dressed in white and much as my friend described her except that her hair hung loose which before was twisted within a silknetShe had superadded likewise to her jacket a pale green riband which fell across her shoulder to the waist at the end of which hung her pipeHer goat had been as faithless as her lover and she had got a little dog in lieu of him which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle as I looked at her dog she drew him towards  her with the string"Thou shalt not leave me  Sylvio  " said she I looked in  Maria's  eyes and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat for as she uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks  I sat down close by her and  Maria  let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchiefI then steep'd it in my ownand then in hersand then in mineand then I wip'd hers againand as I did it I selt such undescribable emotions within me as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion  I am positive I have a soul nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me to the contrary  When  Maria  had come a little to herself I asked her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before She said she was unsettled much at that time but remembered it upon two accountsthat ill as she was she saw the person pitied her and next that  her goat had stolen his handkerchief and she had beat him for the theftshe had wash'd it she said in the brook and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should ever see him again which she added he had half promised her As she told me this she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves tied round with a tendrilon opening it I saw an S mark'd in one of the corners  She had since that she told me stray'd as far as  Rome  and walk'd round St  Peter's  onceand return'd backthat she found her way alone across the  Apennines  had travell'd over all  Lombardy  without moneyand through the flinty roads of  Savoy  without shoeshow she had borne it and how she had got supported she could not tellbut  God tempers the wind  said  Maria to the shorn lamb  Shorn indeed and to the quick said I and wast thou in my own land where I have a cottage I would take thee to it and shelter thee thou shouldst eat of my own bread and drink of my own cupI would be kind to thy  Sylvio  in all thy weaknesses and wanderings I  would seek after thee and bring thee backwhen the sun went down I would say my prayers and when I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart  Nature melted within me as I utter'd this and  Maria  observing as I took out my handkerchief that it was steep'd too much already to be of use would needs go wash it in the streamand where will you dry it  Maria  said II will dry it in my bosom said she'twill do me good  And is your heart still so warm  Maria  said I  I touch'd upon the string on which hung all her sorrowsshe look'd with wistful disorder for sometime in my face and then without saying any thing took her pipe and play'd her service to the VirginThe string I had touch'd ceased to vibratein a moment or two  Maria  returned to herselflet her pipe falland rose up  And where are you going  Maria  said IShe said to  Moulines  Let us go said I together  Maria  put her arm within mine and lengthening the string to let the dog followin that order we entered  Moulines  Though I hate salutations and greetings in the marketplace yet when we got into the middle of this I stopp'd to take my last look and last farewell of  Maria  Maria  though not tall was nevertheless of the first order of fine formsaffliction

from the forefoot of the thillhorse at the beginning of the ascent of mount  Taurira  the postillion dismounted twisted the shoe off and put it in his pocket as the ascent was of five or six miles and that horse our main dependence I made a point of having the shoe fasten'd on again as well as we could but the postillion had thrown away the nails and the hammer in the chaisebox  being of no great use without them I submitted to go on  He had not mounted half a mile higher when coming to a flinty piece of road the poor devil lost a second shoe and from off his other forefoot I then got out of the chaise in good earnest and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the lefthand with a great deal to do I prevailed upon the postillion to turn up to it The look of the house and of every thing about it as we drew nearer soon reconciled me to the disasterIt was a little farmhouse surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard about as much cornand close to the house on one side was a  potagerie  of an acre and a half full of every thing which could make plenty in a  French  peasant's houseand on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal to dress it It was about eight in the evening when I got to the houseso I left the postillion to manage his point as he couldand for mine I walk'd directly into the house  The family consisted of an old greyheaded man and his wife with five or six sons and sonsinlaw and their several wives and a joyous genealogy out of them  They were all sitting down together to their lentilsoup a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promised joy thro' the stages of the repast'twas a feast of love  The old man rose up to meet me and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit down at the table my heart was set down the moment I entered the room so I sat down at once like a son of the family and to invest myself in the character as speedily as I could I instantly borrowed the old man's knife and taking up the loaf cut myself a hearty luncheon and as I did it I saw a testimony in every eye not only of an honest welcome but of a welcome mix'd with thanks that I had not seem'd to doubt it  Was it this or tell me Nature what else it was that made this morsel so sweetand to what magic I owe it that the draught I took of their flaggon was so delicious with it that they remain upon my palate to this hour  If the supper was to my tastethe grace which followed it was much more so  THE GRACE  WHEN supper was over the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife to bid them prepare for the dance the moment the signal was given the women and girls ran all together into the back apartment to tie up their hairand the young men to the door to wash their faces and change their sabots and in three minutes every soul was ready upon a little esplanade before the house to beginThe old man and his wife came out last and placing me betwixt them sat down upon a sopha of turf by the door  The old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielleand at the age he was then of touched it well enough for the purpose His wife sung nowandthen a little to the tunethen intermittedand joined her old man again as their children and grandchildren danced before them  It was not till the middle of the second dance when for some pauses in the movement wherein  they all seem'd to look up I fancied I could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollityIn a word I thought I beheld  Religion  mixing in the dancebut as I had never seen her so engaged I should have look'd upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading me had not the old man as soon as the dance ended said that this was their constant way and that all his life long he made it a rule after supper was over to call out his family to dance and rejoice believing he said that a cheerful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peasant could pay  Or a learned prelate either said I  SENT JOURNEY P  COTTAGE HAPPINESS  NATURE in the midst of thy disorders thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast createdwith all thy great works about thee little hast thou left to give either to the scythe or to the sicklebut to that little thou grantest safety and protection and sweet are the dwellings which stand so shelter'd  SENT JOURNEY P  ILLUSION  SWEET pliability of man's spirit that can at once surrender itself to illusions which cheat expectation and sorrow of their weary momentsLonglong since had ye number'd out my days had I not trod so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground when my way is too rough for my feet or too steep for my strength I get off it to some smooth  velvet path which fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of delights and having taken a few turns in it come back strengthen'd and refresh'dWhen evils press sore upon me and there is no retreat from them in this world then I take a new courseI leave itand as I have a clearer idea of the  Elysian  fields than I have of heaven I force myself like  Aeneas  into themI see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken  Dido  and wish to recognize itI see the injured spirit wave her head and turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonoursI lose the feelings for myself in her'sand in those affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at school  Surely this is not walking in a vain shadownor does man disquiet himself  in vain  by it  he oftener does so in trusting the issue of his commotions to reason onlyI can safely say for myself I was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively as by beating up as fast as I could for some kindly and gentle sensation to fight it upon its own ground  SENT JOURNEY P  LE DIMANCHE  IT was Sunday and when  La Fleur  came in the morning with my coffee and roll and butter he had got himself so gallantly array'd I scarce knew him  I had covenanted at  Montriul  to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop and four Louis d'ors  pour s'adoniser  when we got to Paris and the poor fellow to do him justice had done wonders with it  He had bought a bright clean good scarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the sameThey were not a crown worse he said for the wearingI wish'd him hang'd for telling meThey look'd so fresh that though I knew the thing could not be done yet I would rather have imposed upon my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow than that they had come out of the  Rue de Friperie  This is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at  Paris  He had purchased moreover a handsome blue sattin waistcoat fancifully enough embroideredthis was indeed something the worse for the service it had done but 't was clean scour'dthe gold had been touch'd up and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwiseand as the blue was not violent it suited with the coat and breeches very well he had squeez'd out of the money moreover a new bag and a solitaire and had insisted with the  Fripier  upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches kneesHe had purchased muslin ruffles  bien brodées  with four livres of his own moneyand a pair of white silk stockings for five moreand to top all nature had given him a handsome figure without costing him a sous  He entered the room thus set off with his hair drest in the first stile and with a handsome  bouquet  in his breastin a word there was that look of festivity in every thing about him which at once put me in mind it was Sundayand by combining both together it instantly struck me that the favour he wish'd to ask of me the night before was to spend the day as every body in  Paris  spent it besides I had scarce made the conjecture when  La  Fleur  with infinite humility but with a look of trust as if I should not refuse him begg'd I would grant him the day  pour faire le galant visàvis de sa maitresse  Now it was the very thing I intended to do myself  visàvis  Madame de R****I had retained the  remise  on purpose for it and it would not have mortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dress'd as  La Fleur  was to have got up behind it I never could have worse spared him  But we must  feel  not argue in these embarrassmentsthe sons and daughters of service part with liberty but not with Nature in their contracts they are flesh and blood and have their little vanities and wishes in the midst of the house of bondage as well as their task mastersno doubt they have set their selfdenials at a priceand their expectations are so unreasonable that I would often disappoint them but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it  BeholdBehold I am thy servant  disarms me at once of the powers of a master  Thou shalt go  La Fleur  said I  And what mistress  La Fleur  said I canst thou have pick'd up in so little a time at  Paris La Fleur  laid his hand upon his breast and said 'twas a  petite Demoiselle  at  Monsieur Le Count de B****'sLa Fleur  had a heart made for society and to speak the truth of him let as few occasions slip him as his masterso that some how or otherbut howheaven knowshe had connected himself with the  demoiselle  upon the landing of the staircase during the time I was taken up with my passport and as there was time enough for me to win the Count to my interest  La Fleur  had contrived to make it do to win the maid to hisThe family it seems was to be at  Paris  that day and he had made a party with her and two or three more of the  Count's  household upon the  boulevards  Happy people that once a week at least are sure to lay down all your cares together and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth  SENT JOURN P  THE MONK  CALAIS  A POOR monk of the order of St Francis came into the room to beg something for his Convent No man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingenciesor one man may be generous as another man is puissant  sed non quo ad hanc  or be it as it mayfor there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours they may depend upon the same causes for aught I know which influence the tides themselves'twould oft be no discredit to us to suppose it was so I'm sure at least for myself that in many a case I should be more highly satisfied to have it said by the world "I had had an affair with the moon in which there was neither sin nor shame" than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed wherein there was so much of both  But be this as it may The moment I cast my eyes upon him I was predetermined not to  give him a single sous and accordingly I put my purse into my pocketbutton'd it upset myself a little more upon my centre and advanced up gravely to him there was something I fear forbidding in my look I have his figure this moment before my eyes and think there was that in it which deserved better  The monk as I judged from the break in his tonsure a few scatter'd white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it might be about seventybut from his eyes and that sort of fire that was in them which seemed more temper'd by courtesy than years could be no more than sixtyTruth might lie betweenHe was certainly sixtyfive and the general air of his countenance notwithstanding something seemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time agreed to the account  It was one of those heads which Guido has often paintedmild palepenetrating free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earthit look'd forwards but look'd as if it look'd at something beyond this world How one of his order came by it heaven above who let it fall  upon a monk's shoulders best knows but it would have suited a Bramin and had I met it upon the plains of Indostan I had reverenced it  The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes one might put it into the hands of any one to design for 'twas neither elegant or otherwise but as character and expression made it so it was a thin spare form something above the common size if it lost not the distinction by a bend forward in the figurebut it was the attitude of Intreaty and as it now stands present to my imagination it gain'd more than it lost by it  When he had entered the room three paces he stood still and laying his left hand upon his breast a slender white staff with which he journey'd being in his rightwhen I had got close up to him he introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent and the poverty of his orderand did it with so simple a graceand such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figureI was bewitch'd not to have been struck with it  A better reason was I had predetermined not to give him a single sous  'Tis very true said I replying to a cast upwards with his eyes with which he had concluded his address'tis very trueand heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world the stock of which I fear is no way sufficient for the many  great claims  which are hourly made upon it  As I pronounced the words  great claims  he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunickI felt the full force of the appealI acknowledge it said Ia coarse habit and that but once in three years with meagre dietare no great matters and the true point of pity is as they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry that your order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame the blind the aged and the infirmthe captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions languishes also for his share of it and had you been of the  order of Mercy  instead of the order of St Francis poor as I am continued I pointing at my portmanteau full cheerfully should it have been open'd to you for the ransom of the unfortunateThe monk made me a bowbut of all others resumed I the unfortunate of our own country surely  have the first rights and I have left thousands in distress upon our own shoreThe monk gave a cordial wave with his headas much as to say No doubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world as well as within our conventBut we distinguish said I laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick in return for his appealwe distinguish my good father betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labourand those who eat the bread of other people's and have no other plan in life but to get through it in sloth and ignorance  for the love of God  The poor Franciscan made no reply a hectic of a moment pass'd across his cheek but could not tarryNature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him he shewed nonebut letting his staff fall within his arm he press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast and retired  My heart smote me the moment he shut the doorPsha said I with an air of carelessness three several timesbut it would not do every ungracious syllable I had utter'd crouded back into my imagination I reflected I had no right over the poor Franciscan but to deny him and  that the punishment of that was enough to the dissappointed without the addition of unkind languageI consider'd his grey hairshis courteous figure seem'd to reenter and gently ask me what injury he had done meand why I could use him thusI would have given twenty livres for an advocateI have behaved very ill said I within myself but I have only just set out upon my travels and shall learn better manners as I get along  SEN JOUR P  THE MONK  THE good old monk was within six paces of us as the idea of him cross'd my mind and was advancing towards us a little out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or noHe stopp'd however as soon as he came up to us with a world of frankness and having a horn snuffbox in his hand he presented it open to meYou shall taste minesaid I pulling out my box which was a small tortoise one and putting it into his hand'Tis most excellent said the monk Then do me the favour I replied to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometimes recollect  it was the peaceoffering of a man who once used you unkindly but not from his heart  The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet  Mon Dieu  said he pressing his hands togetheryou never used me unkindlyI should think said the lady he is not likely I blush'd in my turn but from what movements I leave to the few who feel to analyseExcuse me Madame replied II treated him most unkindly and from no provocations 'Tis impossible said the ladyMy God cried the monk with a warmth of asseveration which seem'd not to belong to himthe fault was in me and in the indiscretion of my zealthe lady opposed it and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his could give offence to any  I knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt itWe remained silent without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word Whilst this lasted the monk rubb'd his hornbox upon the sleeve of his tunick and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the  frictionhe made a low bow and said 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contestbut be it as it wouldhe begg'd we might exchange boxesIn saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and having kiss'd itwith a stream of goodnature in his eyes he put it into his bosomand took his leave  I guard this box as I would the instrumental parts of my religion to help my mind on to something better in truth I seldom go abroad without it and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world they had found full employment for his as I learnt from his story till about the fortyfifth year of his age when upon some military services ill requited and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions he abandoned the sword and the sex together and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself  I feel a damp upon my spirits as I am going to add that in my last return through Calais  upon inquiring after Father Lorenzo I heard he had been dead near three months and was buried not in his convent but according to his desire in a little cemetery belonging to it about two leagues off I had a strong desire to see where they had laid himwhen upon pulling out his little horn box as I sat by his grave and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it which had no business to grow there they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections that I burst into a flood of tearsbut I am as weak as a woman and I beg the world not to smile but pity me  S JOURNEY PAGE  FELLOWFEELING  THERE is something in our nature which engages us to take part in every accident to which man is subject from what cause soever it may have happened but in such calamities as a man has fallen into through mere misfortune to be charged upon no fault or indiscretion of himself there is something then so truly interesting that at the first sight we generally make them our own not altogether from a reflection  that they might have been or may be so but oftener from a certain generosity and tenderness of nature which disposes us for compassion abstracted from all considerations of self so that without any observable act of the will we suffer with the unfortunate and feel a weight upon our spirits we know not why on seeing the most common instances of their distress But where the spectacle is uncommonly tragical and complicated with many circumstances of misery the mind is then taken captive at once and  were  it inclined to it has no power to make resistance but surrenders itself to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern So that when one considers this friendly part of our nature without looking farther one would think it impossible for man to look upon misery without finding himself in some measure attached to the interest of him who suffers itI say one would think it impossiblefor there are some tempershow shall I describe themformed either of such impenetrable matter or wrought up by habitual selfishness to such an utter insensibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow creatures as if they were not partakers of the same nature or had no lot or connection at all with the species  SERMON III P  THE UNMERCIFUL MAN  LOOK into the worldhow often do you behold a sordid wretch whose strait heart is open to no man's affliction taking shelter behind an appearance of piety and putting on the garb of religion which none but the merciful and compassionate have a title to wear Take notice with what sanctity he goes to the end of his days in the same selfish track in which he at first set outturning neither to the right hand nor to the leftbut plods onpores all his life long upon the ground as if afraid to look up lest peradventure he should see aught which might turn him one moment out of that strait line where interest is carrying himor if by chance he stumbles upon a hapless object of distress which threatens such a disaster to him  devou  passing by on the other side as if unwilling to  himself to the impressions of nature or  the inconveniences which pity might lead him into upon the occasion  SERMON III P  PITY  IN benevolent natures the impulse to pity is so sudden that like instruments of music which obey the touchthe objects which are fitted to excite such impressions work so instantaneous an effect that you would think the will was scarce concerned and that the mind was altogether passive in the sympathy which her own goodness has excited The truth isthe soul is generally in such cases so busily taken up and wholly engrossed by the object of pity that she does not attend to her own operations or take leisure to examine the principles upon which she acts  SERMON III PAGE  COMPASSION  IN generous spirits compassion is sometimes more than a balance for self preservation God certainly interwove that friendly softness in our nature to be a check upon too great a propensity towards selflove  SERMON V PAGE  SLANDER  OF the many revengeful covetous false and illnatured persons which we complain of in the world though we all join in the cry against them what man amongst us singles out himself as a criminal or ever once takes it into his head that he adds to the numberor where is there a man so bad who would not think it the hardest and most unfair imputation to have any of those particular vices laid to his charge  If he has the symptoms never so strong upon him which he would pronounce infallible in another they are indications of no such malady in himselfhe sees what no one else sees some secret and flattering circumstances in his favour which no doubt make a wide difference betwixt his case and the parties which he condemns  What other man speaks so often and vehemently against the vice of pride sets the weakness of it in a more odious light or is more hurt with it in another than the proud man himself  It is the same with the passionate the designing the ambitious and some other common characters in life and being a consequence of the nature of such vices and almost inseperable from them the effects of it are generally so gross and absurd that where pity does not forbid it is pleasant to observe and trace the cheat through the several turnings and windings of the heart and detect it through all the shapes and appearances which it puts on  SERMON IV P  HOUSE OF MOURNING  LET us go into the house of mourning made so by such afflictions as have been brought in merely by the common cross accidents and disasters to which our condition is exposedwhere perhaps the aged parents sit brokenhearted pierced to their souls with the folly and indiscretion of a thankless childthe child of their prayers in whom all their hopes and expectations centeredperhaps a more affecting scenea virtuous family lying pinched with want where the unfortunate support of it  having long struggled with a train of misfortunes and bravely fought up against themis now piteously borne down at the lastoverwhelmed with a cruel blow which no forecast or frugality could have preventedO God look upon his afflictionsbehold him distracted with many sorrows surrounded with the tender pledges of his love and the partner of his careswithout bread to give them unable from the remembrance of better days to digto beg ashamed  When we enter into the house of mourning such as thisit is impossible to insult the unfortunate even with an improper lookunder whatever levity and dissipation of heart such objects catch our eyesthey catch likewise our attentions collect and call home our scattered thoughts and exercise them with wisdom A transient scene of distress such as is here sketched how soon does it furnish materials to set the mind at work how necessarily does it engage it to the consideration of the miseries and misfortunes the dangers and calamities to which the life of man is subject By holding up such a glass before it it forces the mind to see and reflect upon the vanitythe perishing  condition and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world From reflections of this serious cast how insensibly do the thoughts carry us fartherand from considering what we arewhat kind of world we live in and what evils befal us in it how naturally do they set us to look forwards at what possibly we shall befor what kind of world we are intendedwhat evils may befal us thereand what provision we should make against them here whilst we have time and opportunity If these lessons are so inseparable from the house of mourning here supposedwe shall find it a still more instructive school of wisdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wise man seems to confine it in the text in which by the house of mourning I believe he means that particular scene of sorrow where there is lamentation and mourning for the dead Turn in hither I beseech you for a moment Behold a dead man ready to be carried out the only son of his mother and she a widow Perhaps a more affecting spectacle a kind and indulgent father of a numerous family lies breathlesssnatched away in the strength of his agetorn in an evil hour from his children and the bosom of a disconsolate  wife Behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears with settled sorrow in their looks going heavily along to the house of mourning to perform that last melancholy office which when the debt of nature is paid we are called upon to pay to each other If this sad occasion which leads him there has not done it already take notice to what a serious and devout frame of mind every man is reduced the moment he enters this gate of affliction The busy and fluttering spirits which in the house of mirth were wont to transport him from one diverting object to anothersee how they are fallen how peaceably they are laid In this gloomy mansion full of shades and uncomfortable damps to sieze the soulsee the light and easy heart which never knew what it was to think before how pensive it is now how soft how susceptible how full of religious impressions how deeply it is smitten with sense and with a love of virtue Could we in this crisis whilst this empire of reason and religion lasts and the heart is thus exercised with wisdom and busied with heavenly contemplationscould we see it naked as it isstripped of its passions unspotted by the world and regardless of its pleasureswe might then safely rest  our cause upon this single evidence and appeal to the most sensual whether Solomon has not made a just determination here in favour of the house of mourning not for its own sake but as it is fruitful in virtue and becomes the occasion of so much good Without this end sorrow I own has no use but to shorten a man's daysnor can gravity with all its studied solemnity of look and carriage serve any end but to make one half of the world merry and impose upon the other  SERM II P  FRAILTY  THE best of men appear sometimes to be strange compounds

said he hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me I thought by the accent it had been an apostrophe to his child but 'twas to his ass and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road which had occasioned  La Fleur's  misadventure The man seemed to lament it much and it instantly brought into my mind  Sancho's  lamentation for his but he did it with more true touches of nature  The mourner was sitting upon a stonebench at the door with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side which he took up from time to timethen laid them downlook'd at them  and shook his head He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again as if to eat it held it some time in his handthen laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridlelook'd wistfully at the little arrangement he had madeand then gave a sigh  The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him and  La Fleur  amongst the rest whilst the horses were getting ready as I continued sitting in the postchaise I could see and hear over their heads  He said he had come last from Spain where he had been from the furthest borders of  Franconia  and had got so far on his return home when his ass died Every one seem'd desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home  It had pleased heaven he said to bless him with three sons the finest lads in all Germany but having in one week lost two of them by the smallpox and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper he was afraid of being berest of them all and made a vow if heaven would not take  him from him also he would go in gratitude to St  Jago  in Spain  When the mourner got thus far on his story he stopp'd to pay nature her tributeand wept bitterly  He said heaven had accepted the conditions and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature who had been a patient partner of his journeythat it had eat the same bread with him all the way and was unto him as a friend  Every body who stood about heard the poor fellow with concern  La Fleur  offered him moneyThe mourner said he did not want itit was not the value of the assbut the loss of himThe ass he said he was assured loved himand upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met  Thou hast one comfort friend said I at least in the loss of thy poor beast I'm sure thou hast been a merciful master to himAlas said the mourner I thought so when he was alivebut now he is dead I think otherwiseI fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for himthey have shortened the poor creature's days and I fear I have them to answer forShame on the world said I to myselfDid we love each other as this poor soul but lov'd his ass'twould be something  SEN JOURNEY P  HUMOURING IMMORAL APPETITES  THE humouring of certain appetites where morality is not concerned seems to be the means by which the Author of nature intended to sweeten this journey of lifeand bear us up under the many shocks and hard jostlings which we are sure to meet with in our wayAnd a man might with as much reason musfle up himself against sunshine and fair weatherand at othertimes expose himself naked to the inclemencies  of cold and rain as debar himself of the innocent delights of his nature for affected reserve and melancholy  It is true on the other hand our passions are apt to grow upon us by

upon the head of Aaron that run down to his skirtsimporting that this balm of life is felt and enjoyed not only by governors of kingdoms but is derived down to the lowest rank of life and tasted in the most private recessesall from the king to the peasant are refreshed with its blessings without which we can find no comfort  in any thing this world can giveIt is this blessing gives every one to

councils in so strange and unexpected a manner as to cast a damp upon our best schemes and warmest endeavours  SERMON XXXIX P  Captain Shandy's Justification of his own Principles and Conduct in wishing to continue the War Written to his Brother  I AM not insensible brother  Shandy  that when a man whose profession is arms wishes as I have done for warit has an ill aspect to the worldand that how just and right soever his motives and intentions may behe stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in doing it  For this cause if a soldier is a prudent man which he may be without being a jot the less brave he will be sure not to utter his wish in the hearing of an enemy for say what he will an enemy will not believe himHe will be cautious of doing it even to a friendlest he may suffer in his esteemBut if his heart is overcharged and a secret sigh for arms must have its vent he will reserve it for the ear of a brother who knows his character to the bottom and what his true notions dispositions and principles of honour are What I  hope  I have  been in all these brother  Shandy  would be unbecoming in me to saymuch worse I know have I been than I oughtand something worse perhaps than I think But such as I am you my dear brother  Shandy  who have sucked the same breasts with meand with whom I have been brought up from my cradleand from whose knowledge from the first hours of of our boyish pastimes down to this I have concealed no one action of my life and scarce a thought in itSuch as I am brother you must by this time know me with all my vices and with all my weaknesses too whether of my age my temper my passions or my understanding  Tell me then my dear brother  Shandy  upon which of them it is that when I condemned the peace of  Utrecht  and grieved the war was not carried on with vigour a little longer you should think your brother did it upon unworthy views or that in wishing for war he should be bad enough to wish more of his fellowcreatures slainmore slaves made and more families driven from their peaceful habitations mere+ly for his own pleasureTell me brother  Shandy  upon what one deed of mine do you ground it  If when I was a schoolboy I could not hear a drum beat but my heart beat with itwas it my fault Did I plant the propensity there Did I sound the alarm within or Nature  When  Guy  Earl of  Warwick  and  Parismus  and  Parismenus  and  Valentine  and  Orson  and the  Seven Champions of England  were handed around the schoolwere they not all purchased with my own pocket money Was that selfish brother  Shandy  When we read over the siege of  Troy  which lasted ten years and eight monthsthough with such a train of artillery as we had at  Namur  the town might have been carried in a weekwas I not as much concerned for the  Greeks  and  Trojans  as any boy of the whole school Had I not three strokes of a ferula given me two on my right hand and one on my left for calling  Helena  a bitch for it Did any one of you shed more tears for  Hector  And when king  Priam  came to the camp to beg his body and returned weeping back to  Troy  without ityou know brother I could not eat my dinner  Did that bespeak me cruel Or because brother  Shandy  my blood flew out into the  camp and my heart panted for warwas it a proof it could not ache for the distresses of war too  O brother 'tis one thing for a soldier to gather laurelsand 'tis another to scatter cypress  'Tis one thing brother  Shandy  for a soldier to hazard his own lifeto leap first down into the trench where he is sure to be cut in pieces'Tis one thing from public spirit and a thirst of glory to enter the breach the first manto stand in the foremost rank and march bravely on with drums and trumpets and colours flying about his ears'Tis one thing I say brother  Shandy  to do thisand 'tis another thing to reflect on the miseries of warto view the desolations of whole countries and consider the intolerable fatigues and hardships which the soldier himself the instrument who works them is forced for sixpence a day if he can get it to undergo  Need I be told dear  Yorick  as I was by you in  Le Fever  's funeral sermon  That so soft and gentle a creature born to love to mercy and kindness as man is was not shaped for this  But  why did you not add  Yorick  if not by NATUREthat he is so by NECESSITYFor what is war what is it  Yorick  when fought as ours has been upon principles of  liberty  and upon principles of  honour  what is it but the getting together of quiet and harmless people with their swords in their hands to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds And heaven is my witness brother  Shandy  that the pleasure I have taken in these thingsand that infinite delight in particular which has attended my sieges in my  bowling green  has arose within me and I hope in the Corporal too from the consciousness we both had that in carrying them on we were answering the great ends of our creation  T SHANDY VOL III CHAP  MERCY  MY uncle  Toby  was a man patient of injuriesnot from want of couragewhere just occasions presented or called it forthI know no man under whose arm I would

digestedconsolation ever comes too soonand after it is digestedit comes too latethere is but a mark between these two as fine almost as a hair for a comforter to take aim at  T SHANDY VOL II CHAP  THE STARLING  BESHREW the  sombre  pencil said I vauntinglyfor I envy not its powers which paints the evils of life with so hard and deadly a colouring The mind sits terrified at the objects she has magnified herself and blackened reduce them to their proper size and hue she overlooks them'Tis true said I correcting the propositionthe Bastile is not an evil to be despisedbut strip it of its towersfill up the fosseunbarricade the  doorscall it simply a confinement and suppose 'tis some tyrant of a distemperand not of a man which holds you in itthe evil vanishes and you bear the other half without complaint  I was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy with a voice which I took to be of a child which complained "it could not get out"I looked up and down the passage and seeing neither man woman or child I went out without further attention  In my return back through the passage I heard the same words repeated twice over and looking up I saw it was a starling hung in a little cage"I can't get outI can't get out" said the starling  I stood looking at the bird and to every person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side towards which they approached it with the same lamentations of its captivity"I can't get out" said the starlingGod help thee said I but I will let thee out cost what it will so I turned about the cage to get the door it was twisted and  double twisted so fast with wire there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to piecesI took both hands to it  The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance and thrusting his head through the trellis pressed his breast against it as if impatientI fear poor creature said I I cannot set thee at liberty"No said the starling"I can't get outI can't get out" said the starling  I vow I never had my affections more tenderly awakened nor do I remember an incident in my life where the dissipated spirits to which my reason had been a bubble were so suddenly called home Mechanical as the notes were yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted that in one moment they overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the Bastile and I heavily walked up stairs unsaying every word I had said in going down them  Disguise thyself as thou wilt still slavery said Istill thou art a bitter draught and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee thou art no less bitter on that account'Tis  thou thrice sweet and gracious goddess addressing myself to LIBERTY whom all in public or in private worship whose taste grateful and ever will be so till NATURE herself shall changeno  tint  of words can spot thy snowy mantle or chymic power turn thy sceptre into ironwith thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust the swain is happier than his monarch from whose court thou art exiledGracious heaven cried I kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascentGrant me but health thou great Bestower of it and give me but this fair goddess as my companionand shower down thy mitres if it seems good unto thy divine providence upon those heads which are aching for them  SENT JOURNEY P  THE CAPTIVE  THE bird in his cage pursued me into my room I sat down close by my table and leaning my head upon my hand I began to figure to myself the miseries of confinement I was in a right frame for it and so I gave full scope to my imagination  I was going to begin with the millions of my fellowcreatures born to no inheritance but slavery but finding however affecting the picture was that I could not bring it near me and that the multitude of sad groups in it did but distract me  I took a single captive and having first shut him up in his dungeon I then looked through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture  I beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confinement and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferr'd Upon looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish in thirty years the western breeze had not once fann'd his bloodhe had seen no sun no moon in all that timenor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his latticehis children  But here my heart began to bleedand I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait  He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw in the furthest corner of his dungeon  which was alternately his chair and bed a little calendar of small sticks were laid at the head notch'd all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed therehe had one of these little sticks in his hand and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap As I darkened the little light he had he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door then cast it downshook his head and went on with his work of affliction I heard his chains upon his legs as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundleHe gave a deep sighI saw the iron enter into his soulI burst into tearsI could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn  SENT JOURNEY P  THE DWARF  I WAS walking down that which leads from the  Carousal  to the  Palais Royal  and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it I took hold of his hand and help'd him over Upon turning up his face to look at him  after I perceived he was about fortyNever mind said I some good body will do as much for me when I am ninety  I feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my species who have neither size or strength to get on in the worldI cannot bear to see one of them trod upon and had scarce got seated beside an old  French  officer at the Opera Comique ere the disgust was exercised by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in  At the end of the orchestra and betwixt that and the first sidebox there is a small esplenade left where when the house is full numbers of all ranks take sanctuary Though you stand as in the parterre you pay the same price as in the orchestra A poor defenceless being of this order had got thrust somehow or other into this luckless placethe night was hot and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself The dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides but the thing which incommoded him most was a tall corpulent  German  near seven feet high who stood directly betwixt him  and all possibility of seeing either the stage or the actors The poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards by seeking for some little opening betwixt the  German's  arm and his body trying first one side then the other but the  German  stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imaginedthe dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest drawwell in  Paris  so he civilly reach'd up his hand to the  German's  sleeve and told him his distressThe  German  turn'd his head back look'd down upon him as  Goliah  did upon  David  and unfeelingly resumed his posture  I was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monk's little horn boxAnd how would thy meek and courteous spirit my dear monk so temper'd to  bear and forbear  how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor soul's complaint  The old  French  officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion as I made the apostrophe took the liberty to ask me what was the matterI told him the story in three words and added how inhuman it was  By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes and in his first transports which are generally unreasonable had told the  German  he would cut off his long queue with his knifeThe  German  look'd back coolly and told him he was welcome if he could reach it  An injury sharpened by an insult be it to who it will makes every man of sentiment a party I could have leaped out of the box to have redressed itThe old  French  officer did it with much less confusion for leaning a little over and modding to a centinel and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distressthe centinel made his way up to itThere was no occasion to tell the grievancethe thing told itself so thrusting back the  German  instantly with his muskethe took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him before himThis is noble said I clapping my hands togetherAnd yet you would not permit this said the old officer in  England  In  England  dear Sir said I  we sit all at our ease  The old  French  officer would have set me at unity with myself in case I had been at variance  by saying it was a  bon mot  and as a  bon mot  is always worth something at  Paris  he offered me a pinch of snuff  SENT JOURNEY P  CHARITY  WHEN all is ready and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn unless you are a little sour'd by the adventure there is always a matter to compound at the door before you can get into your chaise and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty who surround you Let no man say "Let them go to the devil"'tis a cruel journey to send a few miserables and they have had sufferings enow without it I always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand and I would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving themthey will be register'd elsewhere  For my own part there is no man gives so little as I do for few that I know have so little to give but as this was the first public act of  my charity in  France  I took the more notice of it  A wellaway said I I have but eight sous in the world shewing them in my hand and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for 'em  A poor tatter'd soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim by retiring two steps out of the circle and making a disqualifying bow on his part Had the whole parterre cried out  Place aux dames  with one voice it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect  Just heaven for what wise reasons hast thou order'd it that beggary and urbanity which are at such variance in other countries should find a way to be at unity in this  I insisted upon presenting him with a single sous merely for his  politesse  A poor little dwarfish brisk fellow who stood overagainst me in the circle putting something first under his arm which had once been a hat  took his snuffbox out of his pocket and generously offered a pinch on both sides of him it was a gift of consequence and modestly declinedThe poor little fellow press'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeness  Prenez enPrenez  said he looking another way so they each took a pinchPity thy box should ever want one said I to myself so I put a couple of sous into ittaking a small pinch out of his box to enhance their value as I did itHe felt the weight of the second obligation more than that of the first'twas doing him an honourthe other was only doing him a charityand he made me a bow down to the ground for it  Here said I to an old soldier with one hand who had been compaign'd and worn out to death in the servicehere's a couple of sous for thee  Vive le Roi  said the old soldier  I had then but three sous left so I gave one simply  pour l'amour de Dieu  which was the footing on which it was begg'dThe poor woman had a dislocated hip so it could not be well upon any other motive  Mon cher et tres charitable Monsieur  There's no opposing this said I  My Lord Anglois  the very sound was worth the moneyso I gave  my last sous for it  But in the eagerness of giving I had overlook'd a  pauvre honteux  who had no one to ask a sous for him and who I believed would have perish'd ere he could have ask'd one for himself he stood by the chaise a little without the circle and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had seen better daysGood God said Iand I have not one single sous left to give himBut you have a thousand cried all the powers of nature stirring within meso I gave himno matter whatI am ashamed to say  how much  nowand was ashamed to think how little then so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition as these two fixed points are given him he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum  I could afford nothing for the rest but  Dieu vous benisseEt le bon Dieu vous benisse encore  said the old soldier the dwarf c The  pauvre honteux  could say nothinghe pull'd out a little handkerchief and wiped his face as he turned awayand I thought he thank'd me more than them all  SENT JOURNEY P  REFLECTIONS ON DEATH  THE Corporal  Tread lightly on his

many millions have been made to drink of itwhich if it can poison all earthly happiness when exercised barely upon our bodies what must it be when it comprehends both the slavery of body and mindto

Inquisition hear the melancholy notes sounded in every cellConsider the anguish of mock trials and the exquisite tortures consequent thereupon mercilessly inflicted upon the unfortunate where the racked and weary soul has so often wished to take its leavebut cruelly not suffered to departConsider how many of these helpless wretches have been haled from thence in all periods of this tyrannic

wrote to you lastbut why is my pen so perverse I have been to ***** and my errand was of so peculiar a nature that I must give you an account of itYou will scarce believe me when I tell you it was to outjuggle  a juggling attorney to put craft and all its power to defiance and to obtain justice from onewho has a heart foul enough to take advantage of the mistakes of honest simplicity and who has raised a considerable fortune by artifice and injustice However I gained my pointit was a star and garter to methe matter was as follows  "A poor man the father of my Vestal having by the sweat of his brow during a course of many laborious years saved a small sum of money applied to this scribe to put it out to use for him this was done and a bond given for the moneyThe honest man having no place in his cottage which he thought sufficiently secure put it in a hole in the thatch which had served instead of a strong box to keep his moneyIn this situation the bond remained till the time of receiving his interest drew nighBut alasthe rain which had done no mischief to his gold had found out his papersecurity and had rotted it to pieces"It would be a difficult matter to paint the distress of the old countryman upon this discoveryLe came to me weeping and begged my advice and assistanceit cut me to the heart  Frame to yourself the picture of a man upwards of sixty years of agewho having with much penury and more toil with the addition of a small legacy scraped together about fourscore pounds to support him in the infirmities of old age and to be a little portion for his child when he should be dead and gonelost his little hoard ot once and to aggravate his misfortune by his own neglect and incaution"If I was young Sir said he my affliction would have been lightand I might have obtained it againbut I have lost my comfort when I most wanted itmy staff is taken from me when I cannot go alone and I have nothing to expect in future life but the unwilling charity of a ParishOfficer"Never in my whole life did I wish to be rich with so good a grace as at this timeWhat a luxury would it have been to have said to this afflicted fellow creature"There is thy moneygo thy waysand be at peace"But alas the Shandy family were never much encumbered with money and I the poorest of them all could only assist him with good councilbut I did not stop hereI went myself with him

restored to himBravobravo  If a man has a right to be proud of any thingit is of a good action done as it ought to be without any base interest lurking at the bottom of it  LETTER VI TO HIS FRIENDS  A SUBJECT FOR COMPASSION  IF there is a case under heaven which calls out aloud for the more immediate exercise of compassion and which may be looked upon as the compendium of all charity surely it is this and I am persuaded there would want nothing more to convince the greatest enemy to these kind of charities that it is so but a bare opportunity of taking a nearer view of some of the more distressful objects of it  Let him go into the dwellings of the unfortunate into some mournful cottage where  poverty and affliction reign together There let him behold the disconsolate widowsittingsteeped in tearsthus sorrowing over the infant she knows not how to succour"O my child thou art now left exposed to a wide and a vicious world too full of snares and temptations for thy tender and unpractised age Perhaps a parent's love may magnify those dangersbut when I consider thou art driven out naked into the midst of them without friends without fortune without instruction my heart bleeds beforehand for the evils which may come upon thee God in whom we trusted is witness so low had his providence placed us that we never indulged one wish to have made thee richvirtuous we would have made theefor thy father  my husband was a good man and feared the Lord  and though all the fruits of his care and industry were little enough for our support yet he honestly had determined to have spared some portion of it scanty as it was to have placed thee safely in the way of knowledge and instructionBut alas he is gone from us never to return more and with him are fled the means of doing itFor  Behold the creditor is come upon us to  take all that we have  " Grief is eloquent and will not easily be imitatedBut let the man who is the least friend to distresses of this nature conceive some disconsolate widow uttering her complaint even in this manner and then let him consider  if there is any sorrow like  THIS  sorrow wherewith the Lord has afflicted her  or whether there can be any charity like that of taking  the child out of the mother's bosom  and rescuing her from these apprehensions Should a heathen a stranger to our holy religion and the love it teached should he  as he journeyed come to the place where  SHE LAY  when he saw would he not have compassion on  her God forbid a Christian should  this day  want it or at any time  look upon  such a distress  and pass by on the other side  Rather let him do as his Saviour taught him  bind up the wounds and pour  comfort into the heart of one whom the hand of God has so bruised Let him practise what it is with Elijah's transport to say to the afflicted widow  See thy Son liveth  liveth by my charity and the bounty of this hour to all the purposes which make life desirableto be made a good man and a profitable subject on one hand to be trained up to such a sense of his duty as may secure him an interest in the world to come  and with regard to this world to be so brought up in it to a love of honest labour and industry as all his life long to earn and eat his bread with joy and thankfulness  SERMON V PAGE  COMPASSION  I CANNOT conceive but that the very  mechanical motions  which maintain life must be performed with more equal vigour and freedom in that man whom a great and good soul perpetually inclines to shew mercy to the miserable than they can be in a poor sordid selfish wretch whose little contracted heart melts at no man's affliction but sits brooding so intently over its own plots and concerns as to see and feel nothing and in truth enjoy nothing beyond himself and of whom one may say what that great master of nature has speaking of a natural sense of harmony which I think with more justice may be said of compassion that the man who had it not  Was fit for treasons

the first and strongest desire of his naturein every stage of his life he searches for it as for hid treasurecourts it under a thousand different shapesand though perpetually disappointedstill persistsruns after and enquires for it afreshasks every passenger who comes in his way  Who will shew him any good  who will assist him in the attainment of it or direct him to the discovery of this great end of all his wishes  He is told by one to search for it among the more gay and youthful pleasures of life in scenes of mirth and sprightliness where happiness ever presides and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will see at once painted in her looks A second with a graver aspect points  out to the costly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erectedtells the enquirer that the object he is in search of inhabits therethat happiness lives only in company with the great in the midst of much pomp and outward state That he will easily find her out by the coat of many colours she has on and the great luxury and expense of equipage and furniture with which she always sits surrounded  The Miser blesses Godwonders how any one would mislead and wilfully put him

dwelling of the prudent man who knows and understands the worth of money and cautiously lays it up against an evil hour that it is not the prostitution of wealth upon the passions or the parting with it at all that constitutes happinessbut that it is the keeping it together and the  having  and  holding  it fast to him and his heirs for ever which are the chief attributes that form this great idol of human worship to which so much incense is offered up every day  The Epicure though he easily rectifies so gross a mistake yet at the same time he plunges him if possible into a greater for hearing

of his way That this deity has long been banished from noise and tumults where there was no rest found for her and was fled into folitude far from all commerce of the world and in a word if he would find her he must leave this busy and intriguing scene and go back to that peaceful scene of retirement and books from which he first set out  In this circle too often does a man run tries all

are the ups and downs of life and fortune must be uncommonly gracious to that mortal who does not experience a great variety of themthough perhaps to these may be owing as much of our pleasures as our pains there are scenes of delight in the vale as well as the mountain and the inequalities of nature  may not be less necessary to please the eyethan the varieties of life to improve the heart At best we are but a shortsighted race of beings with just light enough to discern our wayto do that is our duty and should be our care when a man has done this he is safe the rest is of little consequence  Cover his head with a turf or a stone  It is all one it is all one  LETTER IV TO HIS FRIENDS  THE CONTRAST  THINGS are carried on in this world sometimes so contrary to all our reasonings and the seeming probabilities of successthat even the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strongnay what is stranger stillnor yet bread to the wise who should last stand in want of itnor yet riches to the men of understanding who you would think best qualified to acquire themnor yet favour to men of skill whose merit and pretences bid the fairest for itbut that there are some secret and unseen workings  in human affairs which baffle all our endeavours and turn aside the course of things in such a mannerthat the most likely causes disappoint and fail of producing for us the effect which we wished and naturally expected from them  You will see a man of whom was you to form a conjecture from the appearances of things in his favouryou would say was setting out in the world with the fairest prospect of making his fortune in itwith all the advantages of birth to recommend himof personal merit to speak for himand of friends to push him forwards you will behold him notwithstanding this

contrast to this He shall come into the world with the most unpromising appearanceshall set forwards without fortune without friendswithout talents to procure him either the one or the other

unsurmountable difficulties which first threatened himtime and chance shall open him a waya series of successful occurrences shall lead him by the hand to the summit of honour and fortune and in a

there is selfishness and meanness enough in the souls of one part of the world to hurt the credit of the other part of it is what I shall not dispute against but to judge of the whole from this bad sample and because one man is plotting and artful in his natureor a second openly makes his pleasure or his profit the whole center of all his designsor because a third straithearted wretch sits confined within himselffeels no misfortunes but those which touch himself to involve the whole race without mercy under such detested characters is a conclusion as false as it is pernicious and was it in general to gain credit could serve no end but the rooting out of our nature all that is generous and planting in the stead of it such an aversion to each other as must untie the bands of society and rob us of one of the greatest pleasures of it the mutual communications of kind offices and by poisoning the fountain rendering every thing suspected that flows through it  SERMON VII PAGE  VICE NOT WITHOUT USE  THE lives of bad men are not without useand whenever such a one is drawn not with a corrupt view to be admiredbut on purpose to be detestedit must excite such a horror against vice as will strike indirectly the same good impression And though it is painful to the last degree to paint a man in the shades which his vices have cast upon him yet when it serves this end it carries its own excuse with it  SERMON IX PAGE  EFFECTS OF MISFORTUNE  WHAT by successive misfortunes by failings and cross accidents in trade by miscarriage of projectswhat by unsuitable expences of parents extravagances of children and the many other secret ways whereby riches make themselves wings and fly away so many surprising revolutions do every day happen in  families that it may not seem strange to say that the posterity of some of the most liberal contributors here in the changes which one century may produce may possibly find shelter under this very plant which now they so kindly water Nay

his wild way of talking he would say that gravity was an errant scoundrel and he would add of the most dangerous kind toobecause a sly one and that he verily believed more honest wellmeaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelvemonth than by pocketpicking and shoplifting in seven In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say there was no dangerbut to itselfwhereas the very essence of gravity was design and consequently deceit'twas a taught  trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that with all its

WHEN I reflect upon man and take a view of that dark side of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of troublewhen I consider how oft we eat the bread of affliction and that we are born to it as to the portion of our inheritancewhen one runs over the catalogue of all the cross reckonings and sorrowful items with which the heart of man is overcharged 'tis wonderful by what hidden

twists and refracts them from their true directionsthat with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without it  T SHANDY V I C  CONJUGAL HAPPINESS  IT must have been observed by many a peripateric philosopher that nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease and to sustain his sufferings at home It is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy for one pair of shoulders 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond  her  limits but 'tis so ordered that from the want of languages connections and dependencies and from the difference in education customs and habits we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere as often amount to a total impossibility  SEN JOURNEY P  LIFE

sweetly dost thou mix with the blood and help it through the most difficult and tortuous passages to the heart  SEN JOUR P  PERFECTION  MAN has a certain compass as well as an instrument and the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key in him so that if you begin a note too high or too low there must be a want either in the upper or under part to fill up the system of harmonyA polished nation makes every one its debtor and besides urbanity itself like the fair sex has so many charms it goes against the heart to say it can do ill and yet I believe there is but a certain line of perfection that man take him altogether is empowered to arrive atif he gets beyond he rather exchanges qualities than gets them I must not presume to say how far this has affected the FrenchBut should it ever be the case of the English in the progress of their resentments to arrive at the same polish which distinguishes the French if we did not lose the  politesse de caeur  which inclines men more to humane actions than courteous oneswe should at least lose that distinct variety and originality of character which distinguishes  them not only from each other but from all the

Christian Hero  cowards have even foughtnay sometimes even conquered but a coward never forgaveIt is not in his naturethe power of doing it flows only from a strength and greatness of soul conscious of its own force and security and above the little temptations of resenting every fruitless attempt to interrupt its happiness  SERM XII P  FAVOURS  IN returning favours we act differently from what we do in conferring them in the one case we simply consider what is bestin the other what is most acceptable The reason is that we have a right to act according to our own ideas of what will do the party most good in the case where we bestow a favourbut where we return one we lose this right and act according to his conceptions who has obliged us and endeavour to repay in such a manner as we think it most likely to be accepted in discharge of the obligation  SERM XIII P  RUSTIC FELICITY  MANY are the silent pleasures of the honest peasant who rises cheerfully to his labourlook into his

hours and glad his heart as you could conceive in the most affluent stationAnd I make no doubt in general but if the true account of his joys and sufferings were to be ballanced with those of his bettersthat the upshot would prove to be little more than thisthat the rich man had the more meatbut the poor man the better stomachthe one had more luxurymore able physicians to attend and set him to rightsthe other more health and soundness in his bones and less occasion for their helpthat after these two articles betwixt them were balancedin all other things they stood upon a levelthat the sun

than a sword to the hardened and senselessIf these reflections hold true with regard to misfortunesthey are the same with regard to enjoymentswe are formed differentlyhave different tastes and perceptions of thingsby the force of habit education or a particular cast of mindit happens that neither the use or possession of the same enjoyments and advantages produce the same happiness and contentmentbut that it differs in every man almost according to his temper and complexion so that the selfsame happy accidents in life which shall give raptures to the choleric or sanguine man shall be received with  indifference by the cold and phlegmaticand so oddly perplexed are the accounts of both human happiness and misery in this worldthat trifles light as air shall be able to make the hearts of some men sing for joyat the same time that others with real blessings and advantages without the power of using them have their hearts heavy and discontented  Alas if the principles of contentment are not within usthe height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a man's stature as to his happiness  SERMON XLIV P  AGAINST HASTY OPINION  THERE are numbers of circumstances which attend every action of a man's life which can never come to the knowledge of the worldyet ought to be known and well weighed before sentence with any justice can be passed upon

alliance  SERMON XXIV P  COVETOUSNESS  TO know truly what it is we must know what masters it servesthey are many and of various casts and humoursand each one lends it something of its own complexional tint and character  This I suppose may be the cause that there is a greater and more whimsical mystery in the love of money than in the darkest and most nonsensical problem that ever was pored on  Even at the best and when the passion seems to seek something more than its own amusement  there is littlevery little I fear to be said for its humanityIt may be a sport to the Miserbut considerit

Contentmentwhich like the treasure hid in the field for which a man sold all he had to purchaseis of that price that it cannot be had at too great a purchase since without it the best condition in life cannot make  us happyand with it it is impossible we should be miserable even in the worst  SERMON XV P  HUMILITY CONTRASTED WITH PRIDE  WHEN we reflect upon the character of Humilitywe are apt to think it stands the most naked and defenceless of all virtues whateverthe least able to support its claims against the insolent antagonist who seems ready to bear him down and all opposition which such a temper can make  Now if we consider him as standing aloneno doubt in such a case he will be overpowered and trampled upon by his opposerbut if we consider the meek and lowly man as he isfenced and guarded by the love the friendship and wishes of all mankindthat the other stands alone hated discountenanced without one true friend or hearty wellwisher on his sidewhen this is balanced we shall have reason to change our opinion and be convinced that the humble man strengthened with such an alliance is far  from being so overmatched as at first sight he may appearnay I believe one might venture to go further and engage for it that in all such cases where real fortitude and true personal courage were wanted he is much more likely to give proof of it and I would sooner look for it in such a temper than in that of his adversary Pride may make a man violentbut Humility will make him firmand which of the two do you think likely to come off with honourhe who acts from the changeable impulse of heated blood and follows the uncertain motions of his pride and furyor the man who stands cool and collected in himself who governs his resentiments instead of being governed by them and on every occasion acts upon the steady motives of principle and duty  SERMON XXV P  WITH regard to the provocations and offences which are unavoidably happening to a man in his commerce with the worldtake it as a ruleas a man's pride isso is always his displeasure as the opinion of himself risesso does the injuryso does his resentment 'tis this which gives edge and force to the instrument which has struck himand excites that heat in the wound which renders it incurable  See how different the case is with the humble man one half of these painful conflicts he actually escapes the other part fall lightly on himhe provokes no man by contempt thrusts himself forward as the mark of no man's envy so that he cuts off the first fretful occasions of the greatest part of these evils and for those in which the passions of others would involve him like the humble shrub in the valley gently gives way and scarce feels the injury of those stormy encounters which rend the proud cedar and tear it up by its roots  SERMON XXV P  PRIDE  THE proud manseehe is sore all over touch himyou put him to pain and though of all others he acts as if every mortal was void of all sense and feeling yet is possessed with so nice and exquisite a one himself that the slights the little neglects and instances of disesteem which would be scarce felt by another man are perpetually wounding him and ofttimes piercing him to his very heart  SERMON XXIV P  Pride is a vice which grows up in society so insensiblysteals in unobserved upon the heart upon so many occasionsforms itself upon such strange pretensions and when it has done veils itself under such a variety of unsuspected appearancessometimes even under that of Humility itselfin all which cases Selflove like a false friend instead of checking most treacherously feeds this humourpoints out some excellence in every soul to make him vain and think more highly of himself than he ought to thinkthat upon the whole there is no one weakness into which the heart of man is more easily betray'dor which requires greater helps of good sense and good principles to guard against  SERMON XXIV P  BEAUTY  BEAUTY has so many charms one knows not how to speak against it and when it happens that a graceful figure is the habitation of a virtuous soul when the beauty of the face speaks out the modesty and humility of the mind and  the justness of the proportion raises our thoughts up to the art and wisdom of the great Creator something may be allowed itand something to the embellishments which set it offand yet when the whole apology is readit will be found at last that Beauty like Truth never is so glorious as when it goes the plainest  SERMON XXIV P  WISDOM  LESSONS of wisdom have never such power over us as when they are wrought into the heart through the groundwork of a story which engages the passions Is it that we are like iron and must first be heated before we can wrought upon or Is the heart so in love with deceit that where a true report will not reach it we must cheat it with a fable in order to come at truth  SERMON XX P  HUNGER  OF all the terrors of nature that of one day or other dying by hunger is the greatest and it is wisely wove into our frame to awaken man to industry and call forth his talents and though we seem to go on carelessly sporting with it as we do with other terrorsyet he that sees this enemy fairly and in his most frightful shape will need no long remonstrance to make him turn out of the way to avoid him  SERMON XX P  DISTRESS  NOTHING so powerfully calls home the mind as distress the tense fibre then relaxesthe soul retires to itselfsits pensive and susceptible of right impressions if we have a friend 'tis then we think of him if a benefactor at that moment all his kindnesses press upon our mind  SERMON XX P  IMPOSTURE  IMPOSTURE is all dissonance let what master soever of it undertake the part let him harmonise and modulate it as he may one tone will contradict another and whilst we have ears to hear we shall distinguish it 'tis truth only which is consistent and ever in harmony with itself it sits upon our lips like the natural notes of some melodies ready to drop out whether we will or noit racks no invention to let ourselves alone and needs fear no critic to have the same excellency in the heart which appears in the action  SERMON XVII P  CONTENTMENT  THERE is scarce any lot so low but there is something in it to satisfy the man whom it has befallen providence having so ordered things that in every man's cup how bitter  soever there are some cordial dropssome good circumstances which if wisely extracted are sufficient for the purpose he wants themthat is to make him contented and if not happy at least resigned  SERMON XV P  EVILS  UNWILLINGLY does the mind digest the evils prepared for it by othersfor those we prepare ourselveswe eat but the fruit which we have planted and watereda shattered fortunea shattered frame so we have but the satisfaction of shattering them ourselves pass naturally enough into the habit and by the ease with which they are both done they save the spectator a world of pity but for those like Jacob's brought upon him by the hands from which he look'd for all his comfortsthe avarice of a parentthe unkindness of a relationthe ingratitude of a childthey are evils which leave a scarbesides as they hang over the heads of all and therefore may fall upon anyevery lookeron has an interest in  the tragedybut then we are apt to interest ourselves no otherwise than merely as the incidents themselves strike our passions without carrying the lesson furtherIn a wordwe realize nothingwe sighwe wipe away the tearand there ends the story of misery and the moral with it  SERMON XXII P  OPPRESSION  SOLOMON says Oppression will make a wise man madWhat will it do then to a tender and ingenuous heart which feels itself neglectedtoo full of reverence for the author of its wrongs to complainsee it sits down in silence robbed by discouragements of all its natural powers to pleaseborn to see others loaded with caressesin some uncheery corner it nourishes its discontentand with a weight upon its spirits which its little stock of fortitude is not able to withstandit droops and pines awaySad victim of caprice  SERMON XXII P  VIRTUE AND VICE  WHOEVER considers the state and condition of human nature and upon this view how much stronger the natural motives are to virtue than to vice would expect to find the world much better than it is or ever has beenFor who would suppose the generality of mankind to betray so much folly as to act against the common interest of their own kind as every man does who yields to the temptation of what is wrong  SERMON XXXIII P  SIN  NO motives have been great enough to restrain those from sin who have secretly loved it and only sought pretences for the practice of it  SERMON XXXIII P  SINCERITY  AN inward sincerity will of course influence the outward deportment but where the one is wanting there is great reason to suspect the absence of the other  SERMON XLIII P  WISDOM  THERE is no one project to which the whole race of mankind is so universally a bubble as to that of being thought wise and the affectation of it is so visible in men of all complexions that you every day see some one or other so very solicitous to establish the character as not to allow himself leisure to do the things which fairly win itexpending more art and stratagem to appear so in the eyes of the world than what would suffice to make him so in truth  It is owing to the force of this desire that you see in general there is no injury touches a man so sensibly as an insult upon his parts and  capacity tell a man of other defects that he wants learning industry or applicationhe will hear your reproof with patienceNay you may go further take him in a proper season you may tax his moralsyou may tell him he is irregular in his conductpassionate or revengeful in his natureloose in his principlesdeliver it with the gentleness of a friendpossibly he'll not only bear with youbut if ingenuous he will thank you for your lecture and promise a reformationbut hinthint but at a defect in his intellectualstouch but that sore placefrom that moment you are look'd upon as an enemy sent to torment him before his time and in return may reckon upon his resentment and illwill for ever so that in general you will find it safer to tell a man he is a knave than a fooland stand a better chance of being forgiven for proving he has been wanting in a point of common honesty than a point of common senseStrange souls that we are as if to live well was not the greatest argument of wisdomand as if what reflected upon our morals did not most of all reflect upon our understandings  SERMON XXVI P  CORPORAL TRIM'S REFLECTIONS ON DEATH  MY young master in  London  is dead said  Obadiah    A green sattin nightgown of my mother's which had been twice scoured was the first idea which  Obadiah's  exclamation brought into  Susannah's  headThen quoth  Susannah  we must all go into mourning  O 'twill be the death of my poor Mistress cried  Susannah  my mother's whole wardrobe followedWhat a procession her red damaskher orangetawnyher white and yellowlutestringsher brown taffataher bonelaced caps her bedgownsand comfortable underpetticoatsNot a rag was left behind"  Noshe will never look up again  " said  Susannah  We had a fat foolish scullionmy father I think kept her for her simplicityshe had been all autumn struggling with a dropsyHe is  deadsaid  Obadiah  he is certainly deadSo am not I said the foolish scullion  Here is sad news  Trim  cried  Susannah  wiping her eyes as  Trim  stepp'd into the kitchenmaster  Bobby  is dead and  buried  the funeral was an interpolation of  Susannah's  we shall have all to go into mourning said  Susannah  I hope not said  Trim  You hope not cried  Susannah  earnestlyThe mourning ran not in  Trim's  head whatever it did in  Susannah's  I hopesaid  Trim  explaining himself I hope in God the news is not true I heard the letter read with my own ears answered  Obadiah  Oh he's dead said  Susannah  As sure said the scullion as I am alive  I lament for him from my heart and my soul said  Trim  fetching a sighPoor creaturepoor boy poor gentleman  He was alive last  Whitsuntide  said the coachman  Whitsuntide  alas cried  Trim  extending his right arm and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read the sermonwhat is  Whitsuntide Jonathan  for that was the coachman's  name or  Shrovetide  or any tide or time past to this Are we not here now continued the Corporal striking the end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor so as to give an idea of health and stabilityand are we notdropping his hat upon the ground gone in a moment'Twas infinitely striking  Susannah  burst into a flood of tearsWe are not stocks and stones  Jonathan Obadiah  the cookmaid all meltedThe foolish fat scullion herself who was scouring a fishkettle upon her knees was roused with itThe whole kitchen crouded about the Corporal  To us  Jonathan  who know not what want or care iswho live here in the service of two of the best of mastersbating in my own case his majesty King  William  the Third whom I had the honour to serve both in  Ireland and Flanders  I own it that from  Whitsuntide  to within three weeks of  Christmas  'tis not long'tis like nothingbut to those  Jonathan  who know what death is and what havock and destruction he can make before a man can well wheel about'tis like a whole ageO  Jonathan  'twould make a goodnatured man's heart  bleed to consider continued the Corporal standing perpendicularly how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that timeAnd trust me  Susy  added the Corporal turning to  Susannah  whose eyes were swimming in waterbefore that time comes round againmany a bright eye will be dim  Susannah  placed it to the right side of the pageshe weptbut she curt'sied tooAre we not continued  Trim  looking still at  Susannah  are we not like a flower of the fielda tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliationelse no tongue could have described  Susannah's  afflictionis not all flesh grass'Tis clay'tis dirtThey all look'd directly at the scullionthe scullion had just been scouring a fishkettleIt was not fair  What is the finest face that ever man looked atI could hear  Trim  talk so for ever cried  Susannah  what is it  Susannah  laid her hand upon  Trim's  shoulderbut corruption  Susannah  took it off  Now I love you for thisand 'tis this delicious mixture within you which makes you  dear creatures what you areand he who hates you for itall I can say of the matter isThat he has either a pumpkin for his heador a pippen for his heartand whenever he is dissected 'twill be found so  For my own part I declare it that out of doors I value not death at allnot this added the Corporal snapping his fingersbut with an air which no one but the Corporal could have given to the sentimentin battle I value death not this and let him not take me cowardly like poor  Joe Gibbins  in scouring his gunWhat is he A pull of a triggera push of a bayonet an inch this way or thatmakes the differenceLook along the lineto the rightsee  Jack's  down well'tis worth a regiment of horse to himNo'tis  Dick  Then  Jack's  no worse Never mind whichwe pass onin hot pursuit the wound itself which brings him is not feltthe best way is to stand up to himthe man who flies is in ten times more danger than the man who marches up into his jawsI've look'd him added the Corporal an hundred times in the faceand know what he isHe's nothing  Obadiah  at all in the fieldBut he's very frightful in a house quoth  Obadiah  I  never mind it myself said  Jonathan  upon a coachbox  I pity my mistressShe will never get the better of it cried  Susannah  Now I pity the Captain the most of any one in the family answered  Trim  Madam will get ease of heart in weepingand the Squire in talking about itbut my poor master will keep it all in silence to himselfI shall hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month together as he did for Lieutenant  Le Fever  An' please your honour do not sigh so piteously I would say to him as I laid beside him I cannot help it  Trim  my master would say'tis so melancholy an accidentI cannot get it off my heartYour honour fears not death yourselfI hope  Trim  I fear nothing he would say but the doing a wrong thingWell he would add whatever betides I will take care of  Le Fever's  boyAnd with that like a quieting draught his honour would sall asleep  I like to hear  Trim's  stories about the Captain said  Susannah  He is a kindlyhearted gentleman said  Obadiah  as ever livedAyeand as brave a one too said the Corporal as ever  stept before a platoon There never was a better officer in the king's armyor a better man in God's world for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon though he saw the lighted match at the very touchholeand yet for all that he has a heart as soft as a child for other peopleHe would not hurt a chickenI would sooner quoth  Jonathan  drive such a gentleman for seven pounds a yearthan some for eightThank thee  Jonathan  for thy twenty shillingsas much  Jonathan  said the Corporal shaking him by the hand as if thou hadst put the money into my own pocketI would serve him to the day of my death out of love He is a friend and a brother to meand could I be sure my poor brother  Tom  was deadcontinued the Corporal taking out his handkerchiefwas I worth ten thousand pounds I would leave every shilling of it to the Captain  Trim  could not refrain from tears at this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his masterThe whole kitchen was affected  TRIS SHANDY VOL III C  MR SHANDY's RESIGNATION FOR THE LOSS OF HIS SON  PHILOSOPHY has a fine saying for every thingFor  Death  it has an entire set  "'Tis an inevitable
