 THE WATERMAN OR  The First of August  A BALLAD OPERA  IN TWO A  S  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL HAYMARKET  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand PRICE ONE SHILLING  Dramatis Personae  MEN  TUG  Mr BANNISTER  BUNDLE  Mr WILSON  ROBIN  Mr WESTON  WOMEN  Mrs BUNDLE  Mrs THOMPSON  WILELMINA  Mrs JEWELL  TO THE PUBLIC  FINDING among the different pieces I have composed for Ranelagh and the Theatre a number of Ballads which I took great pains with and which have been but little heard I thought I could not better employ my leisure time than in furnishing upon some familiar plan the dialogue necessary to work up these materials into a Ballad Farce a species of entertainment which has always been well received and which as it has lain dormant for some time I thought would have so far the charms of novelty to recommend it  I had heard of a piece of this sort which has the characters of a Waterman and a Gardener in it and the scene of which is laid at Battersea This I enquired after but was informed it was out of print I nevertheless liked the idea of those two characters so well that I determined  to pursue the hint as for as it was necessary for my purpose I dare say it must be evident to every one that I have done no more I never read the piece in question nor do I for a certainty at this moment know the title of it  I mention this circumstance because I am resolved to acknowledge at all times from whence I collect any matter for the trifles I may have an opportunity of presenting to the public I must be an egregious egotist indeed and little entitled to the indulgence they have hitherto favoured me with if I could be so unconscious of my own inability as to suppose I ever can present them with any thing worthy their notice without assistance of this sort beside in this I am serving myself for I must be well convinced the most effectual way to secure their indulgence is to deal as honestly by them as they deal generously by every man in my situation  With regard to the performers if I mentioned the merit of any one in particular I  should do injustice to the rest I shall therefore say in general that their assiduity has been unwearied upon this as well as upon every other similar occasion  The piece is indeed incomparably performed and it is very apparent that the greatest part of its success is owing to this circumstance  THE WATERMAN OR  The First of August  ACT I  SCENE I  A Gardener's Garden where several Gardeners are at Work some digging c others together with several Women tying up bundles of Asparagus BUNDLE and TUG seated under a Tree at Breakfast upon cold Roast Beef a Tankard of Beer upon the Table  CHORUS  LABOUR lads e'er youth be gone  For see apace the day steels on  Labour is the poor man's wealth  Labour 'tis that gives him health  Labour makes us while we sing  Happier than the greatest king  Then labour lads e'er youth be gone  For see apace the day steals on  BUN  This now is my delight to sit at breakfast while the men work Come honest Tom let us make an end of our tankard before my wife gets up her raking so in London where between you and I she stays a devilish deal longer than while she sells the sparrowgrass keeps her abed woundy late of a morning  TUG  Why Master Bundle I have oftentimes thought to myself that it was a wondersome kind of thing how it came to pass that you two agree so badly when out of all the four and twenty hours you are hardly ever above two of them together  BUN  Ah Thomas Thomas 'tis very hard that a man like me can't be allow'd to get drunk once a day without being call'd to an account for it but between you and I she is the arrantest  Mrs BUN  within  What are you all about there Where's your lazy idle master  BUN  You hear she has begun to ring her usual peal this is the way the moment she is up  TUG  And I believe she seldom leaves off till she goes to bed does she Master Bundle  BUN  No nor then neither every thing must be her way or there's no getting any peace As soon as the marketing's over in town away she and her favourite Robin trudge to the twoshilling gallery of one of the playhouses where they have pick'd up such a pack of damn'd nonsense about sentiments and stuff that I am not only obliged to put up with her scolding me all the time I do see her but I am scolded in a language I don't understand  TUG  Why I should like that best now for then you know one has no right to take it for scolding at all  BUN  Oh when once she raises her voice you never can take it for any thing else  TUG  Why then mayhap 'tis all concerning this same playhouse business that she's so stout against  me and does all she can to serve Master Robin with Miss Wilhelminy  BUN  Ay there was another of her freaks she was then as fond of romances as she is now of plays and though my father who was as plain a man as myself swore he would not leave us a farthing if we did not call the girl Margery nothing would satisfy her forsooth but we must give her the name of Wilelmina'Tis such a damn'd confounded hard name that I was a matter of three years before I cou'd pronounce it right  TUG  Well stand to your oars for here she comes  SCENE II  Mrs BUN  IS it not a most marvellous thing Mr Bundle that I must be such an eternal slave to my family in this here manner while you and your cologuing companions are besotting and squandering away your time with your guzzling and every thing goes to rack and manger I that am such a quiet wellbred easy tame creature that never scolds nor riots nor dins your faults in your ears but am always as gentle and as patient as a lamb  BUN  You are a very good wife to be sure my dear only a little inclined to talking if you now had no tongue or I had no ears we should be the happiest couple in the world  Mrs BUN  What a provocating creaturetongue But this comes of marrying such a scum of a fellow one that you may throw away all the tenderness in the world for before it makes any oppression upon himBut it serves me right for 'tis very well known what great offers I refused upon your account  BUN  I don't know how it shou'd be otherwise than wellknown my love for I generally hear of it about six times a day But my dear don't you think it will be necessary to give orders about loading the cart against you go to London  Mrs BUN  Sir I shall not go to London tonight at all Robin Miss Wilelmina and I are invited to go with a party to see the rowing match this afternoon and afterwards there is to be a hop at Mr Wick's the tallowchandler's where I intend to settle the purliminaries about my daughter's wedding And I desire you to take care that the pines are not all gone before next week for I intend to invite the whole party to a hop here  TUG  But Madam Bundle be'n't you some how or other afraid that what with one thing and what with another you'll hop all the money out of your husband's pocket  Mrs BUN  I don't direct my discourse to you Sir but tis my husband that encourages you to behave in such a brutish and outrageous manner He has promised you I know that you shall have my daughter but I'll make him know who's at homeI willI'll assure you indeedSuch a fellow as youA nasty idling scurvy rapscallion that leads a filthy drunken lazy life sotting in one alehouse and sotting in another and shall such a low brute dare to expire to the honour of marrying Miss Wilelmina Bundle  TUG  I'll tell you what Ma'am Bundle I should not care much for marrying your daughter if she was not of a little better temper than yourself  Mrs BUN  Oh the villainWhy you vile wicked  BUN  My dear how can you put yourself in such a passion you you know who are such a tame creatureone that never scolds or riots  Mrs BUN  I'll riot you all to some tune I willtherefore Mr Bundle unless you wou'd have me sue for a separate maintainancemind what I saynext time I go to London I shall take Robin with me to Doctor's Commons and nothing but your consent to his marrying your daughter shall ever make me look upon you again  AIR  My counsel take  Or else I'll make  The house too hot to hold you  Be rul'd I pray  I'd something say  Did I e'er rout or scold you  But spight to wreak  On one so meek  Who never raves or flies out  On me who am  Like any lamb  Oh I could tear your eyes out  SCENE III  BUNDLE  and  TUG  TUG  Well and what do you say to all this  BUN  Why I'll tell you what honest Thomas for me to contradict her would be much the same thing as for you to row against wind and tide  TUG  Why then that wou'd be bad enough Master Bundle  BUN  But I'll try what I can do with my daughter for you and all I can say to put you in heart is that if I find her as headstrong and as perverse as her mother I shall advise you to have nothing to do with her and so save you from hanging yourself in a month  TUG  But Master Bundle if I marries Miss I expect to be a little happier than you are  BUN  Ah Tom Tom the wisest of us may be deceived  AIR  I  I just as eagerly as thee  Thought when I got a wife  My joy of course so great would be  It needs must last for life  When she agreed to tye the knot  I thought of nothing else  Then all was glee  'Twixt her and me  Nor did I grudge the king his lot  When dingdong went the bells  II  But ah our joys were fleeting soon  Words that did sweetly fall  E'er we had pass'd the honeymoon  To wormwood turn'd and gall  Whatever of furies they invent  Broke out of flaming cells  You now may see  In her and me  We fight and scold and both repent  That dingdong went the bells  SCENE IV  TUG  I don't know but you are in the right of it A waterman wou'd be a confounded fool that would put up a sail with the wind and tide both in his teethBut here comes Miss WilhelminyIf she marries me I'll see if I can't get her to change her name  SCENE V  AIR  Miss WILELMINA  I  Two youths for my love are contending in vain  For do all they can  Their sufferings I rally and laugh at their pain  Which which is the man  That deserves me the most let me ask of my heart  Is it Robin who smirks and who dresses so smart  Or Tom honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  II  Indeed to be prudent and do what I ought  I do what I can  Yet surely papa and mama are in fault  To a different man  They each have advis'd me to yield up my heart  Mama praises Robin who dresses so smart  Papa honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  III  Be kind then my heart and but point out the youth  I'll do what I can  His love to return and return it with truth  Which which is the man  Be kind to my wishes and point out my heart  Is it Robin who smirks and who dresses so smart  Or Tom honest Tom who makes plainness his plan  Which which is the man  TUG  Take my advice Miss and let it be honest Tom  WIL  Oh you brute did you hear me  TUG  Why Miss suppose if I did you a'n't afraid of speaking your mind be ye  WIL  My mind why you have not the assurance to pretend that I said any thing in favour of you  TUG  Why no I can't say directly that you said as how you'd have me but I'm sure you can't help saying yourself that it sounded a little that way  WIL  And do you imagine then I cou'd perfer you to Robin sweet Robin as the song says that's all over a nosegay and the very pink of good breeding  TUG  For my part I makes no comparisments as a body may say but I'd be sorry Miss if there was not others as agreeable and well behaved as he however  WIL  What yourself I supposeDo you know you odious creature that he can spout Romeo by heart and that he's for ever talking similies to me  TUG  I know he's for ever talking nonsense to you  WIL  Oh hold your filthy tongue Did you but hear him compare my cheeks to carnations my hands to lilies my beautiful blue veins to violets my lips to cherries my teeth to snowdrops and my eyes to the sparkling dew that hangs upon the rose trees in the morningwhat would you say then  TUG  Ah but you know Miss that's all in his way  WIL  Then he writes verses Oh dear me the author of the opera book in the parlour window is a fool to him for writing Oh he's a very Ovid's Metamorphose  TUG  Why for the matter of that Miss there are other folks that can write as well as he what would you say now if I had wrote something about and concerning my falling in love with you  WIL  I shou'd then begin to have some hopes of you  TUG  Shou'd youWhy then I have  WIL  Oh dear let's see it  TUG  It's a song Miss I'll sing it to you if you please  AIR  I  And did you not hear of a jolly young waterman  Who at Blackfriars Bridge used for to ply  And he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity  Winning each heart and delighting each eye  He look'd so neat and rowed so steadily  The maidens all flocked in his boat so readily  And he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air  That this waterman ne'er was in want of a fare  II  What sights of fine folks he oft row'd in his wherry  'Twas clean'd out so nice and so painted with all  He was always first oars when the fine city ladies  In a party to Ranelagh went or Vauxhall  And oftentimes wou'd they be giggling and leering  But 'twas all one to Tom their gibing and jeering  For loving or liking he little did care  For this waterman ne'er was in want of a fare  III  And yet but to see how strangely things happen  As he row'd along thinking of nothing at all  He was plyed by a damsel so lovely and charming  That she smiled and so straitway in love he did fall  And wou'd this young damsel but banish his sorrow  He'd wed her tonight before tomorrow  And how should this waterman ever know care  When he's married and never in want of a fare  Well Miss how do you like it  WIL  Like it why it is the very moral of yourselfIf you had not pass'd half your time between Wapping and the Tower Stairs you could never have wrote such a song  TUG  Didn't I tell you as how it was the thingWell now I hope you will consent  WIL  Consent to what  TUG  Why to marry me To be certain you won't find me like your Mr Robin an inconsiderative puppy that will say more in half an hour than he'll stand to in half a year I am a little too much of an Englishman I thank you Miss for that my heart lies in the right place and as we say 'tis not always the best looking boat that goes the safest  WIL  And so Mr Thomas you really think by all this fine talking to make me dying for love of you  TUG  Why Miss for the matter of that I don't see why I shou'd not  WIL  Well then I'll tell you what if you ever expect to have any thing to say to me you must kneel at my feet kiss my hand swear that I am an angel that the very sun moon and stars are not half so bright as my eyes that I am Cupid Venus and the three Graces put together  TUG  Why to be sure all this may be very fine but why should I talk to you in a lingo I don't understand  WIL  This as my dear Robin says is the only language of true lovers and if you don't understand it already you'll learn it for my sake  TUG  I'll tell you what Miss if you don't marry me till I make such a fool of myself 'tis my mind you'll never marry me at all I love you to be sartain there's nobody can say to the contrary of that but you'll never catch me at your Cupids and Wenisses  I am plain and downright I'd do all that in my power lay to make you happy if you'd have me and if you won't I have nothing to do but to cast away care and go on board a man of war for I could never bear to stay here if you was married to another  WIL  What then you'd leave England and all for the love of me  TUG  That's what I wou'd Miss  WIL  Well that wou'd be charming Oh how I shou'd doat upon it if I was to hear them cry through BatterseaStreets  The unfortunate sailor's lamentation for the loss of his mistress  TUG  I'll stick to my word I assure you if you won't have me I'll go on board a man of war  AIR  I  Then farewel my trimbuilt wherry  Oars and coat and badge farewel  Never more at Chelsea Ferry  Shall your Thomas take a spell  II  But to hope and peace a stranger  In the battles heat I go  Where expos'd to every danger  Some friendly ball shall may me low  III  Then mayhap when homeward steering  With the news my messmates come  Even you the story hearing  With a sigh may crypoor Tom  SCENE III  WILELMINA  and  ROBIN  WIL  Well 'tis a most charming thing to plague these creaturesdie for meIf I had not given myself some airs to him he never cou'd have thought of such a thing but that's the way if one does not use them like dogs there's no getting any thing civil from thembut here comes Robin I must plague him in another way  ROB  Miss Wilelmina may I have the unspeakable happiness to tell you how much words fall short of the great honour you wou'd prefer upon me if you wou'd grant me the request of favouring me with your hand this evening at the hop  WIL  Why Mr Robin what particular inclination can you have to dance with me  ROB  What inclination Miss ask the plants why they love a shower ask the sunflower why it loves the sun ask the snowdrop why it is white ask the violet why it is blue ask the trees why they blossom the cabages why they grow 'tis all because they can't help it no more can I help my love for you  WIL  Lord Mr Robin how gallant you are  ROB  Oh my Wilelmina thou art straiter than the straitest tree sweeter than the sweetest flower thy hand is as white as a lilly thy breath is sweet as honeysuckles and when you speak grace is in all your steps heav'n in your eye in every gestureOh dear  WIL  Lord Mr Robin you have said that so often  ROB  Well you never heard me say this in your lifenow mind My heart is for all the world just like a hotbed where the seed of affection sown by your matchless charms and warmed by that sun your  eyes became a beautiful flower which is just now full blown and all I desires Miss is that you'll condescend to gather it and stick in your bosom  WIL  And what pretensions have you to think I shall ever consent to such a thing  ROB  Pretensions Miss because my love is boundless as the sea and my heart is as full of Cupid's arrows as a sweet briar is full of thorns  WIL  But I am afraid if I was foolish enough to believe you you wou'd soon forget me  ROB  Forget you Miss 'tis impossible sooner shall asparagus forget to grow seed forget to rise leaves to fall sooner shall trees grow with their roots in the air and their branches buried in the earth than I forget my Wilelmina  WIL  Well I do declare there's no resisting you  ROB  Resisting me Miss no I don't know how you shou'd my heart is stock'd with love as a flower garden is stock'd with flowers The Cupids that have fled from your eyes and taken shelter there are as much out of number as the leaves on a tree or the colours in a bed of tulips You are to me what the summer is to the garden and if you don't revive me with the sunshine of your favour I shall be overrun with the weeds of disappointment and choak'd up with the brambles of despair  WIL  That wou'd be a pity indeed  ROB  So 'twould indeed Miss  WIL  Do you really love me then  ROB  Love you  AIR  I  Bid the blossoms never be blighted  Birds by scarecrows never be frighted  From the firm earth the oak remove  Teach the jessamine how to blow  Teach the holyoak to grow  Trees bear cherries  Hedges berries  But prithee teach not me to love  II  Grass shall grow than cedars higher  Pinks shall bloom upon the briar  Lilies be as black as jet  Roses smell no longer sweet  Melons ripen without heat  Plumbs and cherries  Taste like berries  When Wilelmina I forget  SCENE IV  BUNDLE  and  WILELMINA  WIL  Oh Papa are you there  BUN  Hush hush speak softly you have not seen your mother have you  WIL  No  BUN  Because I wanted to talk with you Wilelmina my dear  WIL  What upon the old subject I suppose  BUN  Yes but I wou'd not have her hear us  WIL  Oh she's safe enough scolding the men in the garden  BUN  Oh that will take her some time Well have you seen Thomas  WIL  Yes I have seen him and a most deplorable figure he cuts I believe by this time he has enter'd himself on board a man of war that so as the history book says he may put an end to his existence and my cruelty together  BUN  Why did he say he wou'd  WIL  Don't I tell you I was cruel to him and how cou'd he do any less  BUN  Why the girl's distracted but this comes of gadding about with your mother if you had listen'd to my advice I wou'd no more have suffer'd you to put on such ridiculous conceited airswhy you and your mother are the laughing stock of the whole place I never pop my head into the Black Raven to get my pennyworth in a morning but all the folks are full of it  WIL  Why Papa we are only a little genteeler than the rest of the people of Battersea that's all  BUN  Genteeler Do you call it genteel then to take a pleasure in being pointed at But I'll not bear it therefore hear what I have to say or  WIL  Why do you tell me of all this Why don't you speak to my Mama 'Tis no wonder she does what she pleases with me when you know you don't dare to contradict her yourself  BUN  Not dare to contradict her  WIL  No Papa you know she will have her own way and since she has desired me to have Robin what can I do but be dutiful  BUN  What then you owe no duty to me I suppose  WIL  Indeed I do and if I cou'd see that you owed a little to yourself I wou'd oblige you willingly  BUN  But as it is you won't marry Thomas  WIL  I can't indeed  BUN  And for no other reason but because your Mama insists upon your marrying Robin  WIL  No other  BUN  Very well I'll settle the matter she shall do as I please and if she was to come across me now  SCENE V  BUNDLE WILELMINA  and  Mrs BUNDLE  Mrs BUN  What then Mr Bundle  BUN  My dear  Mrs BUN  What cou'd have conduced you to raise your voice to such a pitch I hope you had not the assurance to be tampering and plotting and undermining my daughter's infections and above all I hope you was not hatching up any vile scheme to impose my authority  WIL  Poor Papa how he looks  BUN  Why my dear I did intend to say something to you on that subject but as my tongue does not go quite so fast as a watermill I am afraid it wou'd be but to little purpose  Mrs BUN  Scurvy creature  WIL  If you don't speak Papa I shall be obliged to marry Robin  BUN  I can't help it  WIL  'Tis all your own fault now don't blame meI must marry Robin you have perfectly given me your consent  BUN  So thou cou'dst but unmarry me I'd consent to your marrying whoever you pleas'd  Mrs BUN  Well my dear what has he been saying to you nothing I hope to discourage you in your infections to Robin  WIL  Indeed he has and I can't think of being undutiful  Mrs BUN  Undutiful indeed I say undutifulwhich will reflect most upon you do you think to obey a mean poor spirited drone of a father who has nothing but low mechanical ideras or a mother who is acquainted with Shakespeare goes to all the sentimental comedies can play at cards dance kittelions and allemands and knows every particle of purliteness and highbreeding  WIL  Very true Ma'am but then Mr Thomas is such a sweet young man  Mrs BUN  He  WIL  So goodnatured  Mrs BUN  The Vandil  WIL  So honest  Mrs BUN  Low creature  WIL  Such an immensity of love  Mrs BUN  The Hottentot I'll tell you what Wilelmina your father has put all this into your head  I'll go and give it to him heartily while my blood's up for daring to be beforehand with me and then I have but one word to say to you either comply and marry Robin or else I'll disinherit you from any share in the blood of my family the Grograms and you may creep through life with the dirty pitiful mean paltry low illbred notions which you have gather'd from his family the Bundles  AIR  Wilelmina you see I'm quite cool  Obey me 'tis all for your good  Or may I be counted a fool  If I own you for my flesh and blood  Prefer such a lout Miss for shame  To Robin so spruce and so trim  But your father it is that's to blame  And so I shall e'en talk him  SCENE VI  WILELMINA  Well in all I have read I never met with a girl of more spirit than myselffor I make two lovers and a father and mother as miserable as I can desire and yet am I to blame are not they the authors of all this bustle themselves If I oblige one I disoblige the other I shall therefore set all other considerations aside and consult only my own heart  AIR  I  Too yielding a carriage  Has oft before marriage  To ruin and misery pointed the way  You're shunn'd if complying  But your lover once flying  How eager he'll follow and beg you to stay  II  A coquette ne'er proclaim me  Ye maids then nor blame me  If I wish to be happy whene'er I'm a wife  Each lover's denial  Was only a trial  Which is he that's most likely to love me for life  The END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  BUNDLE  Mrs  BUNDLE  afterwards  WlLELMINA  BUNDLE  WHAT shall I do with this perverse girl I have but poor comfort for my friend ThomasHowever all things consider'd I don't know whether I shou'd not have done him a more unfriendly office by marrying him than by keeping him single For my own part was I to chuse whether I wou'd keep my wife or have the plague on my conscience I shou'd run the risque of the last But mercy on us here she comes'tis a strange thing that I never mention the word plague but she's at my elbow  Mrs BUN  Mr BundleI shall be very cool Sir  BUN  I hope so my dear  Mrs BUN  What the devil is the reason that you have been making all this here piece of work  BUN  My dear  Mrs BUN  I say Sir how comes it to pass that in spight of all my conjunctions to the contrary you will behave so monstrously shameful as to oblige me to put myself in these here passions  BUN  Why my dear are you ever in a passion  Mrs BUN  Don't provoke meyou think I suppose because you have got your daughter on your side to carry all before you but Mr Bundle though  you have been coaxing and wheedling her to marry that low dirtyI won't bemean myself by repeating his filthy name Though I say she has been undutiful and wicked enough to suffer such a low unpolite clown as you to persuade her to marry a fellow as vulgar and as mean as yourself yet if I have any authority you shall no more carry it off in the manner you think  BUN  My dear  Mrs BUN  I won't hear a word  BUN  Have a moment's patience now and I'll convince you  Mrs BUN  I won't have patience nor I won't be convinced 'tis a shame and a scandalous thing and whoever tells me to be patient or wants to convince me it shall be the worse for them  BUN  Go on my dear  Mrs BUN  Oh how I am used I cou'd hang myself for vexation  Crying  BUN  My dear if you had about half as much reason as you have passion how very easily cou'd all these matters be settled for you are wrong from the begining to the end in this affair in the first place I don't think it wou'd be very undutiful in a girl to do what her father desires her was it as you say in the next I desired her to give her consent to marry Thomas 'tis true but she refused me  Mrs BUN  Why this is worse than t'otherFirst use me ill and then result mefor the girl told me with her own mouth that she promised you to marry Thomas  BUN  And she told me with her own mouth she had promised you to marry Robin  Mrs BUN  What am I to think of this  BUN  E'en what you please my dear you know I never dictate to you  Mrs BUN  Here she comes herself we shall know the truth of all this Come here child speak ingenuosly now Did not you tell me that you would not marry Robin  WIL  I did Ma'am  Mrs BUN  There Mr Bundleand pray what reason did you give me for it  WIL  Because Papa had persuaded me to marry Thomas  Mrs BUN  And have you the confidence to look me in the face after all this  BUN  Pray hear me one word  Mrs BUN  I won't hear a syllable  BUN  Nay let me speak in my turn Wilelmina come hear child speak ingenuously did not you tell me you wou'd not marry Thomas  WIL  I did Sir  BUN  There Mrs Bundleand pray what reason did you give me for it  WIL  Because my Mama had persuaded me to marry Robin  BUN  And have you the confidence to look me in the face after this  Mrs BUN  Why you little dirty trollop have you been making a jest of us both  BUN  Indeed my dear there is something  WIL  Hear me my dear Papa and Mama when first you proposed Robin to me and you Thomas I determined to have neither 'till one or the other had given me some proof beside telling me so that he wou'd make me a faithful and affectionate husband the first that does shall have me and though I would not wish to have either of you think me undutiful on that alone shall depend my giving my consent to be a wife  AIR  I  In vain dear friends each art you try  To neither lover's suit inclin'd  On outward charms I'll ne'er rely  But prize the graces of the mind  The empty coxcomb whom you chose  Just like the flower of a day  Shook by each wind that folly blows  Seems born to flutter and decay  II  Your choice an honest aspect wears  To give him pain I oft' have griev'd  But it proceeded from my fears  Than me much wiser are deceiv'd  I thank you both then for your love  Wait for my choice a little while  And he who most shall worthy prove  My hand I'll offer with a smile  SCENE II  BUNDLE  Mrs  BUNDLE  BUN  Well my dear what do you say to all this  Mrs BUN  Say why that I am perfectly in a quandary the confidence of the baggage goes beyond allOne would think she had never been edicated by me  BUN  Oh I am afraid it's her having been edicated by you as you call it that has taught it her  Mrs BUN  What do you stand muttering there about 'tis you she may thank for all these mean notions if she wou'd but suffer me to teach her a little the bonetone she wou'd despise the idera of consulting her heart about marrying such low mechanical stuff has been out of fashion a long time since among people that know how to bemean themselves  BUN  Well but I suppose you intend to let her do what she pleases  Mrs BUN  No Sir do you think I am so tame as to be ruled by my daughter I believe you can witness for me that I seldom let any body rule but myself  BUN  You never let any body rule but yourself my dear and really you do it so well it is a pity to hinder you  Mrs BUN  None of your sneers SirBut I see into the bottom of all this 'tis a scheme between you and your daughter to make a fool of me but I'll after her and cure her of her ridiculous notions of love and a pack of stuff and she shall marry the man I have chose for her orIn short I have determined what to do and let me hear you or her say a single word against it if you dare  AIR  How can she thus low minded be  A girl of her merit  What's become of her spirit  Would the baggage take pattern by me  She'd value the pleasure of no man  But hold up her head  And in all that she said  Claim the privilege due to a woman  Our wil  s ought to be without measure  And the best thing that you  Male creatures can do  Is to buckle to our will and pleasure  SCENE III  BUNDLE TUG  TUG  Master Bundle how fares it I wanted to speak to you but I never likes to interrupt people when they are in agreeable company  BUN  What you saw my wife with me she is the most agreeable company it must be confess'd  TUG  Why she did not seem to be cantancaras with you now  BUN  No her anger was levelled at her daughter but 'tis all the same I feel the good effects of it let her be cantancaras as you call it with who she will  TUG  But Master Bundle how comes it to pass that she shou'd be angry with Miss Wilelmina she has not refused to marry Robin has she  BUN  But she has though and refused to marry you too  TUG  Ay ay why I never heard she had any other sweetheart  BUN  I don't know what the girl has got in her head not Ia parcel of absurd s  uff she has a mind to make fools of us all I believe but there was something well enough too in what she said if she's sincere but the lord help those that trusts too much to them say I  TUG  Why what does she say  BUN  Why that she does not know which she shall have yet but that she'll marry the first that does any thing to deserve her  TUG  Does shewhy then 'tis my opinion she'll marry me  BUN  Why so  TUG  I know why well enough but cou'd not a body speak to her now  BUN  I am going in and I'll send her to you but I wou'd not have you depend too much on her  TUG  I'll run the risque Master Bundle  BUN  Only see the difference between us you are all agog to get married and I wou'd give the world to be rid of my shackles  TUG  Why I believe if a man was to take up the trade of unmarrying folks he would get more money by it than you and I do by our's  BUN  More money  AIR  I  Did but the law appoint us one  Tir'd couples to release again  What shoals of all degrees would run  To break their matrimonial chain  The widow old  Herself and gold  Who to the healthy spendthrift gave  And the rich churl  Who took a girl  Poor wretch with one foot in the grave  II  Prudes who at men would never look  Yet slily tasted Hymen's joy  And wild Coquets who husbands took  When they could get no other toy  Millions would try  The knot to untye  Towards the goal of liberty  Lord what a throng  Would croud along  And in the midst my wife and me  SCENE IV  TUG  and  WILELMINA  TUG  Yes but I hope I shan't have such a crank and humoursome piece of stuff to deal with as you have I don't know not I but for my share I can't see why married people mayn't be happy as well as others 'tis my mind Miss here is trying which is the most loving of us two and if so I wou'd not give my little Robin threepence for his chance for I know as well as can be that he has no more notion of making a woman happy than nothing at allbut here she comes  WIL  Hey day Why I thought you was gone on board a man of war before now  TUG  Why no Miss I e'n't yet gone I am in hopes there will be no occasion if there should I am always one of my word  WIL  Oh you unkind creature to disappoint me so I was in hopes by this time to have received a long letter from you upbraiding me with my cruelty and telling me that you were gone abroad with a broken heart at being disappointed of me  TUG  Why Miss as to breaking my heart to be sure I should go wellnigh to do that if I could not persuade you to have me but I have been thinking that it would be better to try if I can't stay at home and do something to obtain your consent for to be sure the pleasure of having you is not what every body deserves  WIL  Oh 'till I hear you have been venturing your life for me I shall never relent  TUG  Well now Miss I for my part think you will  WIL  Indeed you have a great deal of confidence to think any such thing  TUG  I hope you won't be angry if I do my best to make you  WIL  And what do you call doing your best  TUG  Why 'tis not my way to brag and so I won't say any thing about it now but I have a favour to beg of you if you please  WIU  What is it pray  TUG  Why you know that the young watermen are to row for the Coat and Badge this afternoon and so I have made bold to bespeak a room at the Swan for you and your friends to go and see the sight  WIL  That's very gallant indeed Mr Thomas but you talk of trying to deserve me why did not you make one among the watermen and so win the Coat and Badge yourself  TUG  Well never you mind any thing about that will you accept of my proffer of the room  WIL  Why I think I will  TUG  And do you think now if ever I was to do any thing with an intent to please you that you cou'd bring yourself to look upon me with kindness  WIL  Why I don't know but I might  TUG  Why then I assure you if ever you shou'd be agreeable to marry me you shou'd be as happy as ever love and an honest heart can make you  AIR  I  Indeed Miss such sweethearts as I am  I fancy you'll meet with but few  To love you more true I defy them  I always am thinking of you  There ere maidenswould have me in plenty  Nell Cicely Priscilla and Sue  But instead of all these were there twenty  I never should think but of you  II  False hearts all your money may squander  And only have pleasure in view  Ne'er from you a moment I'll wander  Unless to get money for you  The tide when 'tis ebbing or flowing  Is not to the moon half so true  Nor my oars to their time when I'm rowing  As my heart my fond heart is to you  SCENE V  WILELMINA ROBIN  WIL  There's great honesty about this poor fellowHere comes t'other I see I must choose soon or there will be no peace for me So Mr Robin what news have you  ROB  News My angel news that will make your heart dance with joy and clear away the clouds and mists that hang on thy beautiful face just for all the world as the sun clears away the showers in the month of April  WIL  Indeed I should be glad to hear it  ROB  You can't think how you will be overjoyed  WIL  Shall I Why don't you tell it me then  ROB  Well then Miss I'll keep you no longer in suspence your mother is determined that we shall be married tomorrow morning  WIL  What whether I will or no  ROB  Whether you will or no how can you help it don't I love you better than the ivy loves oak better than cucumbers love heat or birds love cherries I love you better  WIL  Hold hold Mr Robin 'tis necessary in this case I shou'd love you a little  ROB  And don't youHear this you blooming jonquils and lose your sweetness turn white you roses and you lilies red each flower lose its fragrance and it's hue and nature change for Wilelmina's false  WIL  Indeed Mr Robin you have such winning ways that pretty speech has half persuaded me to consent  ROB  Has it  WIL  It has upon my word  ROB  Jonquils smell sweet again roses and lilies keep again your colour and every flower look brighter than before for Wilelmina's true  WIL  How dearly you do love me Mr Robin  ROB  Why Miss the passion which is planted in my heart has taken root as like as can be to a great elm which there is no grubbing up but it spreads farther and farther and you can't for the life of you destroy it 'till you saw down the trunk and all  WIL  That's as much as to say that you'll love me as long as you live  ROB  The very thingLord how sensible you are Miss  WIL  Really Mr Robin you are so gay and agreeable  ROB  E'n't I Miss So every body saysonly think then how you will be enviedWell then I'll step to your Mama and tell her what has past and then I shall have nothing to do but to go to town tomorrow for the ring and licence  AIR  I  Cherries and plumbs are never found  But on the plumb and cherry tree  Parsnips are long turnips are round  So Wilelmina's made for me  II  The scythe to mow the grass is made  Shreds to keep close the straggling tree  The knife to prune to dig the spade  So Wilelmina's made for me  SCENE VI  WILELMINA ROBIN  Mrs  BUNDLE  Mrs BUN  Well Robin have you reform'd her what I order'd youWhat I suppose you have been a fool nowthere never was such a timersome fellow in the worldI tell you what Wilelmina if I find you have been imposing upon this poor bashful creature you will put me in a passion and you know when I am once in a passion I am not easily pacified  WIL  Let me understand you Ma'am  Mrs BUN  Why I sent this blockhead to let you know that I am disolved to see you married tomorrow morning and I know you have been giving yourself some confounded airs or other and so he has been afraid to tell you  WIL  I wonder Ma'am you should be uneasy on that accounthe told me and in very plain terms  Mrs BUN  Well and I hope you had not the conference to say any thing against it  WIL  So far from it Ma'am I now plainly see the great absurdity of attempting to oppose your will  Mrs BUN  And have you consented to have him then  ROB  She has Ma'am  Mrs BUN  Then thou art my child againMr Wick's family will be in raptures at this run Robin and tell them we shall call at their house in our way to the rowing match  WIL  And will you forgive my former disobedience Ma'am  Mrs BUN  Oh it was all your father my dear but I'll now take the pains to instruct you how to behave yourself  WIL  I am obliged to you Ma'am but I don't think I shall ever be so accomplished as you  Mrs BUN  Why I don't think you will ever get my genteel air but as for other matters they are easily understood  WIL  Are they Mama  Mrs BUN  I'll tell you  AIR  To be modish genteel and the true thing my dear  In short to be monstrous wellbred  You must ogle and simper and giggle and leer  And talk the first nonsense that comes in your head  In grave fusty oldfashioned times  'Ere ease and deportment went hence  To be bold was the vilest of crimes  And deceit was an heinous offence  But the fashions are now of another guess kind  Our modes are by no means the same  For bless'd with good eyes we pretend to be blind  And with strength to run miles appear lame  SCENE VII  WILELMINA  Indeed Mama I beg your pardon but I shall not receive any instruction from youLet me seeI have promised her to marry her favorite Robin to heighten the plot a little more I'll e'en go and promise my Papa to marry favorite Thomas and then for the Swan where I think there will be a tolerable confusion What a bustle this same love makes among us we all seem to be afraid of it and yet all wish to possess it  AIR  I  Girls during courtship should at least  No lover trust but doubt him  But when they've sworn before the priest  Then find no fault about him  II  Who venture all upon a stake  Undone if they miscarry  The risks they run from each mistake  Behoves them to be wary  SCENE the Last  A  ROOM  at the  SWAN  Mrs  BUNDLE ROBIN  and Company afterwards  WILELMINA  and afterwards  TUG  and  BUNDLE  Mrs BUN  My dear Mr Wick as to that gentility's every thingI hates to see a parcel of trumpery that knows nothing of life Do Robin step and see after Wilelminawhat can be become of the girl  ROB  She's here Ma'am  Mrs BUN  Come my dear you'll lose the sight they tells me that the rowers have set out from the Old Swan some time  WIL  They are very near surely for see what a number of boats are come in sight  Mrs BUN  Oh I can see them very plain How many is there  WIL  One two three four I think I can count five  Mrs BUN  That smart young man will certainly win it how clean and neat he looks  WIL  Here he comes his boat perfectly flies  Mrs BUN  Oh he'll win it  WIL  He has won it already Madam he's past the stairs  ROB  See he jumps on shore  WIL  And see he's coming this waySurely 'tis not  BUN  Coming on  Here's your Thomas for you he's comingI told you he'd be the first that wou'd do any thing to deserve youHere he is  WIL  And was it you that won the Coat and Badge  TUG  'Twas indeed Miss  WIL  And what made you  AIR  TUG  I row'd for the prize  To receive from those eyes  A kind look from those lips a sweet smile  But lest I should lose  And you for that fault your poor Tom should refuse  My heart it went pitapat all the while  When we came to the pull  How I handled my skull  'Twou'd have done your heart good to have seen us  There was never a boat's length between us  But the Swan once in view  My boat how it flew  And verily b'lieve 'twas all thinking of you  WIL  Thus then I reward you  ROB  What is all this  TUG  Why all this is that I am a happy fellow and you are knock'd out of your chance  WIL  Is not he a sweet fellow Ma'am  How ne  and clean he looks  Mrs BUN  Wilelmina don't put me in passion  WIL  I have no intention Ma'am to do any such thing  Mrs BUN  Why you impudent slut have not you deceived me Deposed upon me Promised me to marry this young manand now  WIL  Indeed Ma'am you must excuse me but in so serious a matter I thought it of much more consequence to consider myself than you besides I was so situated that I must have disobliged either you or my Papa for whenever I gave you a promise I gave one to him and had your choice appeared to me the most likely to make me happy I shou'd not have hesitated a moment in refusing his  ROB  My hopes are all blighted then I find  Mrs BUN  I said all along that this was a contrived thing between you but Mr Bundle you shall smart for it  BUN  My dear you know I am a man of an easy temper and few words but I am pretty firm in keeping a resolution I have suffered you to expose me at home pretty well but if you are resolved to carry your folly to such a height as to expose me abroad I am resolved it shall not be for nothing Therefore either promise before this company to bid adieu to scolding for the future or before this company I will do what you threat'ned me this morningbe separated from you  Mrs BUN  Why I am thunderstruck  BUN  I expected little less but am resolved depend upon it however to let you see that you are very welcome to be mistress of your own house manage your concerns as you like do what you please so you let me be quiet In short do nothing to give me uneasiness and I make an agreement from this moment for you to govern while I smoke  WIL  Dear Mama it is impossible for any thing to be fairer  BUN  Come come she must have a little time to think of it but she'll agree to the terms I'm sure of it and now let us think of nothing but pleasure and as this is the happiest day I ev  saw in my life I say let us make it the merriest  AIR  TUG  Ne'er let your heart my girl sink down  That I am true believe me  Or next time that I row to town  May wind and tide deceive me  By this here breeze  My heart at ease  Now dances at high water  My labour's o'er  I've gain'd the shore  And free from fear  Am landed here  With my dear Gardener's Daughter  Mrs BUNDLE  I see my dear 'tis all in vain  Since this you think expedient  If of the past you'll not complain  Henceforth I'll prove obedient  Folks us'd to cry  A tartar I  Had prov'd and you had caught her  But now shall raise  Each voice in praise  Through all her life  Of the Gardener's wife  As well as of his daughter  BUNDLE  My child you've fairly won my heart  You took no counsel from us  But prizing love and scorning art  Preferr'd your honest Thomas  'Twas wisely done  Shake hands my son  Love's lesson you have taught her  And now my dear  Be but sincere  I do not fear  There'll ne'er appear  So good a wife and daughter  WILELMINA  And now good friends pray take my part  I kept them to their tether  For I had sworn my hand and heart  Should always go together  From fops and beaux  A maiden chose  An honest heart that sought her  See her appear  On tryal here  This very right  If she was right  Applaud the Gardener's daughter  FINIS
