few become abandoned to vice all at once If they who have become most profligate had foreseen at their first setting out the full extent of that depravity and guilt under which they now sit down without concern or remorse they would have sickened at the prospect and shrunk back with horror and detestation Sin is of an insinuating deceitful encroaching nature It is with reason that the Scriptures so often represent it as a  departing from God  The first step carries us but a little from the right road every step removes us a little farther from it at length the distance becomes immense and  we know not how to return  They proceed from evil to evil  is not a description only of one nation peculiarly degenerate it is applicable to every vicious person  Evil men  always  wax worse and worse  Tim iii  Whoever engages in any sinful course will find it difficult not to go forward and still more difficult the farther he has gone A man of an ingenuous mind cannot think of committing the smallest sin without reluctance by forcing himself to commit it he learns to repeat it with less reluctance soon after he takes pleasure in it in consequence of this he commits it often by being often committed it becomes habitual and depraves the whole temper of his soul  IN order to put you on your guard against the deceitful insinuations and successive encroachments of vice I propose to trace out the ordinary steps of the sinner's progress  from evil to evil  However numerous they are they may be naturally reduced to three general stages  THE  first  comprehends those steps of mental indulgence by which irregular inclinations and vicious passions are inwardly cherished till they break forth into overt acts of sin  THE  second  those steps by which in consequence of wilful sin vicious habits are contracted strengthened and multiplied  THE  third  the confirmation of the corrupted heart in profligate wickedness and enmity against religion  THE Psalmist points at a very similar distribution  Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful  Psal i  Three gradations of vice are distinctly marked At first a man  walks  in it indulges himself only in transient acts next he  stands  in it his wickedness is habitual at last he becomes so inflexible and obdurate that he  sits  down satisfied in his degeneracy At first he is occasionally seduced by listening to  the counsel  of the vicious by corrupting communication or by some strong temptation then he spontaneously takes the same  way  with them and customarily conforms to their evil practices and at length he is not only confirmed in his own wickedness but becomes one of the  scornful  ridicules virtue and religion and labours to corrupt those who have not yet abandoned them The body of sin has its  periods of growth analogous to those of man's natural life In its infancy it is kept alive and cherished by favourable circumstances its strength is inconsiderable it may easily be restrained or destroyed In its youth it becomes robust and ungovernable it can support itself it is impetuous uncontroulable and violent in all its exertions When it has reached maturity its constitution is fixt its operations determined its force irresistible and it arrogates authority to tutor men in wickednessEach of the three stages into which we have distinguished the progress of vice will furnish ample matter for a separate discourse  THE first of them shall be our present subject It includes that train of mental indulgences by which irregular inclinations and vicious passions are inwardly cherished till they break forth into overt acts of wilful transgression  When lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin  Jam i  If the desire of a forbidden object or the desire of obtaining any object by unlawful means be not checked as soon as it begins to rise it becomes the embryo of vice and grows and ripens into open wickedness  TOO often it must be acknowledged its growth is extremely quick it is conceived formed and born almost in the same hour Many have never been taught to attend to the difference between right and wrong they are regardless of it and care little how they act Their passions have been seldom curbed and have become so violent by the time they are capable of vice that they hurry them into one sin after another just as they find an opportunity of committing it But such as have received a virtuous and pious education are generally for some time modest and harmless shocked with the baseness of vice and afraid to venture on it Their faults are chiefly those of ignorance or infirmity or inadvertence These seldom throw off the impressions of their education all at once often they efface them by slow and painful touches  YOUNG persons are gradually introduced into the world Temptations meet them and obtrude themselves upon them The good things of this world naturally and in themselves innocently desireable appear in situations in which they cannot reach them but by unlawful means evils to which they are necessarily averse are so placed that they cannot avoid them without sin In the simplicity of his heart the youth  passeth through the street  near the corner  where vice hath her abode unknowing unsuspicious  he goeth the way to her house  Prov vii  The sorceress casts herself in his way she puts on her most dazzling attire she covers her face with smiles she confidently promises him ease pleasure riches or enjoyment she importunately urges him to taste her delights and to share her treasures More fortunate we shall suppose than the  young man void of understanding  whom Solomon  discerned among the youths  Ver  he resists her attacks It is much if he does But to give you the more alarming view of the multiplied dangers of corruption to which the best guarded innocence is obnoxious we shall suppose that after the temptation he continues as averse to vice as before let him be even more careful to shun the like occasions of hazard to his virtue  BUT in this state of probation the greatest care cannot prevent our falling into temptation almost every day He again finds himself in circumstances which invite him perhaps more urgently to the same or to some other vice He retreats not with sufficient speed he guards not his heart with sufficient diligence Elated with hs former victory he is confident  of his own resolution He apprehends no great difficulty in repelling this temptation likewise he has little dread of falling before it he becomes secure and negligent His security it is highly probable will quickly betray him into sin With the best intention of firm attachment to his Lord with full confidence that he never would  be offended because of him that though he should die with him he would not deny him  Mat xxvi    Peter followed Jesus into the judgmenthall but there he was unexpectedly assaulted by a temptation to deny him and he was instantly overpowered by it  Ver    Undervaluing an enemy has often occasioned a defeat If you become insensible of the power of temptation you are lost It is only by keeping at as great a distance from it as possible and by reckoning every temptation formidable to human weakness that you can be safe  BUT suppose your sense of duty so strong as to restrain you though negligent from full compliance from overt acts of sin yet whenever the natural object of a passion presents itself in a situation in which it cannot be lawfully pursued it has a plain tendency to excite the desire of obtaining it by unlawful  means and it has the stronger tendency the oftener it presents itself The very first motion of desire which it necessarily produces is a seed not yet fully shaped and organized but fit to expand itself quickly into sin The desire▪ however faint will soon gain strength if it be not immediately and resolutely crushed The least voluntary indulgence though but in thought will nourish it But when the object of an unlawful passion is often in our view and in our power it is very difficult to abstain from all indulgence so much as in thought It is natural for a man to think of the temptation to which he was exposed and the sin to which it urged him and though at first he think of it with aversion there is danger that he will come in time to regard it with more favourable sentiments Before he is aware imagination paints the object of vicious passion in attractive colours Embellished by its pencil sensual pleasures smile riches glitter honours glow He deliberately fixes his eye upon them he begins to contemplate them with complacence and delight To revel in voluptuousness seems to be enjoyment to abound in wealth appears to be magnificence to bring harm on his enemies he thinks would be a triumph He gives a welcome entertainment to the evil motions of his heartHappy is who then takes the alarm  and flecs while yet he has it in his power to flee This is something more than the first motion and necessary propension of the heart These imaginations are evil and they give form and animation to the embryo of vice If they be indulged they will render the passions irregular and turbulent You will find an inclination rising to gratify them though it be unlawful You will regret that it is unlawful You have a painfulness an eagerness an impatience of desire which you never knew before You pant for the pleasure or the profit which would attend the sin you wish to commit it for the sake of them Already  thine heart  hath  declined to the ways  of sin  devising wicked imaginations  you want but a fit occasion of  going astray in her paths  Prov vi vii  Already your will has consented to the perpetration of iniquity and by that consent your soul is polluted and guilt contracted Sin is conceived it is perfected within it only waits opportunity to be brought forth into act Often men have so far indulged their passions so entirely consented in their hearts to sin that their not committing it is in no measure owing to their virtue but solely to the kindness of Providence in withholding opportunity If they abstain from it when they  have a favourable opportunity it must be by a struggle between pampered passion and the sense of duty harder more determined and more laborious than the weakness of human virtue can generally sustain By inwardly indulging vicious passions for a while vice becomes familiar to our thoughts the horror of it wears off all the principles of restraint are enfeebled They have raised a tumult in the soul amidst which the still voice of conscience cannot be heard they have kindled a flame which all the suggestions of reason cannot extinguish a violent eruption can scarcely be prevented It is by timeously refusing all occasions of indulging them by obstinately denying them their food by withdrawing every incentive to them from the very first that you can through divine assistance hinder their growing into such force and hurrying you on irresistibly to fulfil their dictates  SUPPOSE however your sense of virtue so strong as still to restrain you from the full commission of the sin Passion will pretend that it will be satisfied with some degree of indulgence short of complete gratification It is become too powerful not to be persuasive Forgetful that between disordered passion and virtue no accommodation can take place you are disposed to make some concession  to your passions but with a firm resolution not to go the length of an overt act of sin You will not allow the love of money to carry you to dishonesty but you will yield to it so far as to avail yourselves of a little address You will not suffer malice or resentment to transport you into injury but you will soothe them by treating your enemy as hardly as justice can permit You will not be subservient to the vices of the man whose favour you court but you will not be so nice as not to flatter him in them You will not sink yourself into drunkenness but you will give way to a continuation of exhilarating draughts You will abstain from deeds of uncleanness but you will not deny yourself the pleasure which arises from words or actions of slight lasciviousness You will never enter within the territories of vice but you will indulge yourself in approaching to them You will not transgress the limits of innocence but you will venture as far as is consistent with the preservation of your innocence By such a concession you flatter yourself the importunity of your passions will be diverted the uneasiness which they give you removed and your inclination to the sins which they demand weakened Delusive is the expectation Vice has gained the victory if she once persuades men to make any approach to her There is no  security but in keeping at the greatest distance from her  Enter not into her path go not in her way avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away  Prov iv    Avoid all appearance of evil  Thess v  Is it certain that the very indulgence which you propose to give yourselves is perfectly lawful It is not always easy to fix the precise boundary between virtue and vice They run insensibly into one another like day and night You cannot discern the very point at which the one ends and the other begins By resolving to proceed to the extremest line of innocence a thousand to one but you slide into real vice  The law  of God  is spiritual  Rom vii  and  his word is very pure  Psal cxix  What men call justifiable liberties he often abhors as gross sinsBut suppose the indulgence not absolutely unlawful Yet to venture on it is only to give new force to your temptations and to encrease the danger of your situation It is as if the governour of a fortress instead of maintaining his post should lead out a small garrison to encounter a great army in the open field It is the strength which passion has already acquired by your indulging evil imaginations that enables it to produce an inclination to make any approach to sin and that approach will bring it such an accession of strength as  to produce a much more violent propensity to the completion of the crime Every strong passion every inflamed appetite engrosses the soul and unfits it for the reflection and exertion by which it might be restrained and every advance in the gratification of it proportionably augments its influence and enervates all the powers of resistance Indulgence in whatever has the remotest tendency to vice never fails to invigorate the vicious passion Thus humoured thus gratified it domineers it craves with irresistible importunity it combats the sense of duty it disdains controul it subverts every resolution of retaining our integrity it occasions insupportable uneasiness in forbearing the sin by which its demands would be fulfilled A strong fortification may withstand a great force but if a very small detachment gain an entrance they can introduce the whole with ease Stand remote from vice and you may be safe but go within its reach and you will be drawn forward as by the suction of a whirlpool He who has allowed himself in rigorous exaction will become less scrupulous of extortion He whose resentment has already refused good offices which he persuaded himself were not indispensibly due is the nearer to venturing on ill offices which are indisputably wrong The oftener a man has repeated his draughts the more desirous  he is to continue them and the less aware of the danger of his being intoxicated David espied Bathsheba by accident he indulged his rising passion but so far as to gaze upon her it was inflamed it gave him no rest till it plunged him into adultery A narrow fountain sends forth a copious stream an inconsiderable seed grows up into a stately cedar any vicious passion a little indulged will burst into heinous sin If ever you find yourselves disposed to compound with passion recollect yourselves and retreat without delay you are on the point of sacrificing your innocence  Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burnt Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burnt  Prov vi  Had Joseph allowed himself in any liberties with the wife of Potiphar he must have fallen it was by the most guarded determined avoidance of every approach to guilt that he escaped when she enticed him to incontinence he  refused  with the most peremptory firmness when the temptation was repeated he would hold no parley with it but run to a distance when  she spake to him day by day he hearkened not to her to be with her  and when  she caught him by his garment he fled and got him out  Gen xxxix ▪    BUT if it can be supposed that even after your negligent or presumptuous approaches to  evil your heart still recoils from it and your conscience cannot be reconciled to the unreserved perpetration of it yet vice may cunningly abate your reluctance and elude the opposition of conscience by suggesting that you will indulge yourselves but this one time You will not make a practice of it you will only try the experiment There cannot be very great harm in a single act and you are determined not to repeat it You hope that you shall not again be placed in so difficult a situation but if you should you are resolved to resist Your passion you are confident will be satisfied with this one gratification at least it will be so far blunted as to demand another with less importunity it will want the aid of novelty and you will find it easier to withstand it Infatuated man Can it be easier to forsake a vicious course once begun than to avoid beginning it Can you best secure a retreat from sin by yielding it the victory In every moment of temptation you stand on the brink of a precipice if you begin to stumble your danger is imminent but if you throw yourself over it were dotage to think that you can stop your fall How much hurt you may sustain how much your spirit may be marred your principles spoiled and your temper corrupted by deliberately  consenting to one act of heinous sin it is difficult to say  The beginning of  sin  is as when one letteth out water  Prov xvii  once allowed to overflow it becomes an impetuous torrent sweeping away whatever would oppose it  IF all the indulgence which you have given to your vicious passions has not so far corrupted your hearts as to efface your abhorrence of a great transgression it cannot fail to have at least impaired your sense of obligation and your inclination to comply with the calls of duty If it cannot yet precipitate you into the commission of a gross act of sin it will be able to lead you into the omission of some of those duties which you have hitherto been careful to perform Unfitted by the agitation of your passions for relishing the pleasures of devotion less intent upon its exercises you begin to trifle away the sabbathday you intermit your regular attendance on the ordinances of religious worship you break off your wonted assiduity in prayer to God you read not the Scriptures so frequently or with so much attention and reverence as formerly It is very often by neglecting the external and positive duties of religion that they who have been well educated  and they who have made a fair appearance for a while begin to give themselves up to open vice The neglect passes easily upon them it is not the violation of a moral law and some latitude and many limitations must be admitted in the observance of ceremonial precepts But experience testifies that when they who once were regular have become remiss in outward worship they rarely fail to pass with rapidity into direct immorality and reason declares that it scarcely can be otherwise To learn to think lightly of duties which they used to venerate as sacred naturally unhinges all their principles and subverts the authority of conscience These duties are the great instruments of preserving our regard to moral duties of enlivening the sentiments and supporting the principles which instigate to the practice of them when therefore they are neglected when our own passions and the temptations of the world conspire in impelling us to vice and we refuse to employ the only counterbalance to their impulse how can we but fall headlong into vice Many whose abandoned manners and atrocious crimes brought them at last to an ignominious death have begun their confession with breach of the sabbath and neglect of devotion and have acknowledged a very quick transition from this omission to the perpetration of the basest sins  WERE it possible that your heart tainted with the exorbitance of passion and defenceless by neglect of the means of restraint as it has become should still shrink from heinous immorality the power of ill example and vicious company may soon conquer your repugnance and complete your overthrow The wicked practices and the corrupt fashions of the world are open to every eye the most innocent must see them the most circumspect cannot help taking notice of them if you would altogether avoid even the conversation and society of sinners  then must ye needs go out of the world  Cor v  Every indulgence of irregular passions gives a propensity to fix the mind upon them to feel their force to allow them authority to avail yourselves of their sanction The discourse and the manners of the vicious attract you by their congruity to the depraved motions of your own hearts their freedom and laxness is gratifying and encouraging to the workings of your imagination and your passions they have many agreeable qualities or estimable and useful talents you become fond of them and pleased with their company The vices from which you have hitherto with difficulty restrained yourselves you observe commonly practised by them you abate the  rigour of your restraint and your passions become stronger Your inbred disposition to imitate cooperates with the strength of passion in propelling you to sin You care not to be singular it is unpleasant and you cannot think it necessary You see your elders your superiors and those who are reckoned wiser than yourself allowing themselves in vice and you begin to believe that it is something manly It becomes familiar by being often seen it looks not so hateful as before you first endure it and then embrace it As yet you have been timid afraid of contracting guilt your fear has been roused by every temptation and has kept you from yielding to it but it is allayed by observation of multitudes acting wrong without scruple or apprehension it is despised as a littleness of mind and meanness of spirit you are emboldened to follow their example Modesty is the attendant of innocence and cannot be totally extinguished even by some deviation from innocence it has hitherto been your guard you have been preserved from sin by your full conviction that it is shameful and reproachful you would have been confounded by a detection in it but when you have become the admirer or the companion of men who practise it with impudence avow it with effrontery glory in their enormities affect to  appear worse than they are and ridicule every scruple in fulfilling the desires of their hearts your modesty must be soon effaced and your virtue bereaved of every support To be intimate with the vicious is dangerous to the most confirmed virtue to him who has suffered his passions to grow irregular and excessive it is unavoidable corruption  Go not in with vain persons sit not with evildoers  Psal xxvi  fly from them if you can and if you cannot fly be doubly on your guard  keep  your heart as  with a bridle while the wicked is before you  Psal xxxix    SHOULD happy situations preserve you from the influence of ill company and example or should your conscience remain so active your abhorrence of sin so strong that all that influence cannot forcibly bear it down yet the continued and increasing indulgence of your passions may craftily undermine it and beguile you into sin They will dispose you to seek excuses for the full gratification of them they will prepare your own hearts to suggest pretences for giving them licence they will at least predispose you for laying hold of loose maxims and corruptive principles when you find them in licentious books or hear them in the conversation of the wicked The violence  and importunity of your passions has created a prejudice a prepossession in favour of such opinions and prepossession makes you easily assent to them when you wish that they were true you will without much difficulty persuade yourselves that they are true When Ahab's ambition had made him intent on the conquest of Ramothgilead he eagerly hearkened to the false prophets who encouraged his design against it but could scarcely be brought to consult Micaiah whom he had never found obsequious to his vices and gave him no credit when he disapproved his enterprise  Kings xxii  When any passion has been indulged to a certain degree it begets a propensity to embrace the flattering representations of depraved imagination concerning its object and exertion and to disregard the remonstrances of conscience and the pure principles of religion which condemn its demandsGod will not it possibly insinuates be displeased with you for yielding to it it can do him no hurt you mean only a little gratification or advantage to yourselves not at all to offend him you cannot think that he will grudge you a little pleasure or a little profit when your desire of it has become so vehement that you cannot be happy without it  can he have forbidden your gratifying the passions which himself has implanted in you did he implant them only to torment you But have your lusts already rendered your minds so undiscerning as once to hesitate whether these be the decisions of reason or the sophisms of depravity The naked import of all this is that nothing can displease God which pleases you Hurt him you cannot but does it follow that you cannot hurt yourselves Have you forgotten that God gave you reason and conscience on purpose to govern all your appetites and passions that he requires you to restrain them within the limits of his law that you directly intend and presumptuously resolve to offend and dishonour him whenever you think of allowing them any gratification beyond these limits that when they come to demand it they have far outgrown what God made them and shot up into enormity that the distraction and torment which they now occasion is the fruit of your own mismanagement and neither the intention nor the necessary consequence of God's having implanted themBut though he may be displeased his mercy is great and he will forgive you This too is the sophistry of sin It sets forward its advantages but extenuates or veils its dangers Where then has God declared that the wilful sinner is entitled  to his mercy Where has he promised pardon except on the condition of repentance and reformation Where has he intimated favour to the person who by flattering himself with forgiveness in what he knows to be wrong adds presumptuousness to his disobedience Under this impious delusion you may go on in sin with tranquillity but it is to certain destructionBut though it is unlawful in itself your situation is so peculiar as to justify it your temptations are so strong that it is impossible to resist them And so as you formerly indulged negligence in confidence that you could nevertheless easily avoid sin you now think yourselves authorized to commit it because your greatest efforts must be ineffectual for avoiding it So contradictory are the suggestions of the corrupted heart Fools and blind not to remember that the temptations of this state of probation are appointed not to justify crimes but to exercise and try and improve the virtues of menThe slightest attention to licentious or immoral sentiments and opinions must be fatal If your principles be compatible with vice it will prevail by its own power if they positively favour it they add much to its power and secure its victory With this the riot of the debauchee the dishonesty of the villain the perversion of the promising youth the defection of the person  who seemed for a while to be established in virtue very often has commenced they held in the reins of inclination till their minds were first abused by loose principles  Let the counsel of the wicked be far from you  Job xxi  reject with abhorrence every opinion which pleads for the liberty of doing wrong If you give any ear to it the very next step will probably be to act upon it to break out into vicious practice certainly it will render you more remiss in curbing your vicious passions and from the remission they will acquire new strength and tumble you down before the next temptation Immoral principles will banish the reluctance of your hearts against sin they explode it as the mere murmur of a narrow mind They controvert the admonitions of conscience and dispute its decrees They give authority to crimes  BUT if good principles have been so carefully planted and taken so deep root in your souls as to prevent your admitting a justification of acknowledged vice your indulged passions will put you on finding some disguise under which it may elude your detestation pass itself upon your conscience and betray you into the practice of it Such disguises are  manifold and selfdeceit is active and artful in selecting them Often it borrows them from superstition a form of religion is devised composed wholly of faith and worship the value of moral duties is depreciated and their obligation slackened the immoralities to which you are prone of course become venial in your eyes they will be amply compensated by the soundness of your principles the assiduity and fervour of your devotion and the burning of your zeal and being so easily atoned for you can have little scruple to commit them In this manner a young Pharisee was reconciled to the dishonesty and violence common in his sect and in this manner many Christians have allowed themselves in heinous crimes while they imagined themselves very religious In other cases men give a false colouring to the particular vice to which their propensity is strong They think there may be some means of rendering it consistent with their duty they refine upon it they contrive to make some alteration in its circumstances they mould it into another shape and thus hope to evade its guilt and yet attain its very end Balaam could not be brought to disobey the letter of the divine command but he anxiously sought leave to disobey it and when he could not obtain leave he refused to pronounce a verbal execration against Israel but  he easily reconciled his conscience to what was worse to seduce them into such wickedness as could not but subject them to the real execration of the Almighty  Num xxxi  David's conscience forbad him to cut off Uriah by a publick sentence or an explicit order for assassination but it winked at his making himself the bearer of a command to betray him to certain death and suffered itself to be blinded by the pitiful pretence  the sword devoureth one as well as another  Sam xi  By the artifice of its colouring by shading some of its features and heightening others by setting itself in some fallacious point of view vice sometimes assumes the look even of virtue Delusive imagination shews presumption for lively faith illhumour for seriousness levity for cheerfulness avarice for frugality extravagance for generosity cunning for prudence censoriousness for plaindealing cruelty for godly zeal If you detect not the imposture you will perpetrate the most atrocious sins without condemning yourselves you will even approve yourselves in the perpetration of them If you wish not to be lost never behold any vice but in its own deformity never suffer it to put on a specious mask or to set itself in an attractive attitude God will view all your sins not in the disguise  which your imagination gives them but in their naked form he will estimate them not by the names which you allow them to usurp but according to their real nature he will try all your actions not by the pretences with which you palliate them to yourselves but by the principles and motives from which in you they actually proceed  THUS have I endeavoured to lay open the train of inward indulgences by which irregular inclinations are gradually brought forward into overt acts of wilful sin Temptations to sin everywhere abound they cast themselves in your way they frequently recur you but remit the strictness of your circumspection for a moment in that unhappy moment they assault you and if they cannot surprise you into sinful practice they will at least make some impression on your mind you think of sin with less abhorrence imagination paints its form in pleasing colours you fix your eye upon the picture and are taken with it your passions are inflamed they prompt you to the sin by which they would be gratified they make it painful to forbear it if they cannot all at once precipitate you into the sin they will persuade you to comply with them so far as to make some approach to it and though that approach should happen not to be itself  absolutely unlawful it will at least inflame them more violently and render it torture to abstain from the full gratification of them they will next urge you to gratify them if it were but once and will probably prevail with you if they should still find difficulty in prevailing with you to commit an heinous act of sin the neglect of devotion and religious duties to which your indulgence of them and the depravation of heart consequent upon it must dispose you or the influence of ill company and example to which these must lay you open or some of those loose maxims and immoral sentiments to which these must render you prone to listen or some of those false colourings by which selfdeceit artfully varnishes over the hatefulness of sin cannot fail quickly to remove the difficulty and to betray you into the practice of wickedness  BY such steps as these the welleducated youth is perverted from his innocence and led to commence a career of vice Alas how many come to the full and open practice of vice by a much shorter road By these same steps good men deviate into the particular acts of sin sometimes of heinous sin which in this imperfect state too often degrade their character and pollute their conduct While you are engaged in this inward struggle against  your irregular passions it is in suspence whether you shall remain virtuous or degenerate into vice If you now prefer the latter either you must continue its slaves or you must recover yourselves and that too but incompletely from its dominion by bitter and painful repentance One act of gross sin committed you will experience a wretched change in the state of your mind your innocence is lost your conscience is wounded your peace is gone The aspect of the sin is totally reversed its charms are fled its horrors force themselves into your view you abhor it and you abhor yourself for having committed it You are afraid of God afraid of yourself afraid of every thing You are ashamed to look up you feel that you have disgraced yourself You go about disconsolate and bear a hell within you To be again what you was but one hour ago you would purchase at any price but no price can purchase it A moment may forfeit your innocence but then it is irrecoverable for ever the heartiest repentance cannot efface the humiliating sense of your having fallen or deliver you from the sharp stings of occasional remorse Dreadful are often the reflexions of a soul not wholly depraved on its first act of gross and open sin Yet to suffer them in all their strength is the greatest happiness that can befal the sinner  It is the only thing that can prevent his plunging deeper into wickedness and incurring either more excruciating reflexions in this world or insufferable misery in the next  To render your abstinence from a course of wickedness either easy or certain you must crush sin while it is forming in the heart and the earlier you crush it the easier will be your task and the more infallible your success  Keep thy heart with all diligence  Prov iv  Guard every avenue by which sin may find an entrance into it mark every temptation the moment it occurs and instantly avoid it Attend to the inmost motions of your hearts observe the thoughts which attempt to rise within you if they be evil exclude them or banish them without delay suffer them not to dwell on any unlawful or seducing object accustom them to fix only on what is good or improving Keep a jealous eye over all the workings of imagination turn it away from whatever can encourage vicious passions force it to such views as are fit to check their growth Watch over all your inclinations passions and affections confine them to their proper objects let them never swell into excess Allow not the most hidden purpose or design of sin to find  a moment's entertainment in your souls fortify them by such resolutions as are virtuous By this course alone the innocent can preserve their innocence and by this course alone more laboriously pursued it is that they who have gone some lengths in vice can retrieve themselves  CONTENT not yourselves with endeavouring to restrain your passions from breaking out into vicious practice while you indulge them inwardly It is far from sufficient to regulate your external conduct This was the corrupt doctrine of the Jewish teachers  But ye have not so learned Christ  Eph iv  to this wicked doctrine he set himself in the most zealous opposition Were it possible to confine vicious passions within the heart yet there they are open to the eye of God and odious in his sight and there they polute your souls and destroy your quiet If thou in thy heart consentest to thoughts or designs of sin thou art truly guilty though no trace of them were visible in thy behaviour The lusts of the heart are like ulcers which without a speedy extirpation will fester and become incurable though they lie so deep and are so well concealed by decency of conduct as not to be  seen by men But it is impossible long to regulate the conduct except we first govern the heart  Out of it are the issues of life  Prov iv  No labour will dry up the streams if we cannot drain the fountainhead If evil passions be not mortified in the heart they will soon become ungovernable compel us to vicious practice and involve us in an inextricable labyrinth of wickedness  SERMON II THE PROGRESS OF VICE THE SECOND STAGE  JEREM ix  They proceed from evil to evil  IF the general of an army were informed that the enemy intended to attack him his first care would naturally be to get intelligence of his motions of his present situation of the part on which he expected to make an impression of the stratagems which he would employ for facilitating the execution of his design and the more perfectly he learned these particulars the better he would be prepared to repel him Our condition in this world is similar and our conduct ought to be the same We are every moment in danger of being assaulted and vanquished by sin Its power is great its deceitfulness is greater It gains upon us by gradual often  by imperceptible steps and for every step it makes the most artful preparations To be acquainted with these is to be in some measure qualified for defeating it I have therefore proposed to trace out the progress of vice to explain the manner in which men having given the smallest indulgence to sinful thoughts and inclinations  proceed from evil to evil  In the foregoing discourse I have described the FIRST of the three stages into which that progress may be distinguished by laying open the train of mental indulgences by which irregular inclinations and vicious passions are inwardly cherished till they break forth into overt acts of sin In this discourse I shall endeavour to delineate the SECOND stage which comprehends the steps whereby in consequence of wilful sin vicious habits are contracted strengthened and multiplied  No sooner has a person unaccustomed to vice committed an act of wilful sin than he is dissatisfied with himself and purposes and promises not to repeat it The fear of its being known or the shame of detection the reproaches or the admonitions of virtuous friends heighten his emotions aggravate his remorse and enforce his purposes He is suspicious of his own frailty attentive to his conduct and solicitous to restrain the passion  which had led him astray He hopes that conscience has reassumed its sway and that he is recovered to virtue But after a while passion begins to raise its voice and to exert its strength It has once been gratified and by that gratification both its importunity and its power have been increased Temptations press upon him and plead for the indulgence of his passions Alternately he is disposed to proceed in vice and to return to virtue his mind fluctuates irresolute between the two it is distracted by contrary motions it is worn out with painful agitation it again yields to the violence of passion Very seldom does a man acquiesce in a solitary act of sin having committed one crime many causes concur in producing a repetition of it By once violating innocence you break down the strongest barrier against vice By having been once indulged your vicious inclinations become more refractory and unconquerable At the same time all those principles of your nature which ought to combat them are reduced to act with less confidence and vigour The reluctance which rises strong against a transgression that you have never ventured to commit cannot rise in equal strength against one on which you have already ventured You have already cast off allegiance to conscience and determined that absolute subjection to its  commands is not indispensible You have already disclaimed its authority and withstood its power Having once disobeyed its dictates how should you hold them sacred now Having once forced it to bow its head under the usurpation of lawless lusts how can it be able to throw off the yoke when their usurpation is in some degree established The reasons which you could have urged against the first transgression you can never urge with equal force against any subsequent transgression they have been already despised and contradicted If from the former trespass you have found no immediate inconvenience arise if you have even derived profit or pleasure from it this will encourage you to the repetition of it and will be accepted as a confutation of all the arguments for abstinence Every ill example every seducing maxim every insinuation of selfdeceit will operate more successfully than before To sin a second time you need not put a force upon yourselves you are prone to it you feel little uneasiness in the thought of it You seek no other reason for doing wrong but that you have already done it When temptation has found forward allies in your passions has bribed your principles to admit its claim in silence and has warped your reason to chicane in support of it you cannot be able to withstand  THE repetition of the sin it may be occasions a return of regret selfcondemnation shame and virtuous purposes But they are feebler and more ineffectual than before A short interval of time or the recurrence of temptation totally effaces them Your vicious inclinations were strengthened by being indulged by the restraint which you have since endeavoured to lay upon them they are only irritated they rise ungovernable and rush impetuous into vice like a lion on his prey Your hopeful purposes shrink and faint before them The flame which had been smothered for a while breaks forth with greater fury You cast away your virtue as if you had never formed a design of retaining it One hour you are propense to vice and the next hour uneasy in the recollection of it When you are exposed to no temptation you seem to be reformed but whenever a temptation assaults you you relapse Every time it defeats you with greater ease your efforts to resist it are weaker your inclination to comply with it more eager your consciousness of having complied less painful Your vicious actions become every day more frequent the least temptation is too strong for you Your vicious inclinations are more constantly heard and gratified they drive you on so furiously that  you are again and again plunged into guilt you scarcely know how  BY frequent practice habits of vice must needs be formed Great is the power of custom over the soul of man When we attempt an action which we have never attempted formerly we find it difficult but by performing it often we learn to perform it easily We likewise become prone to it the passion which tends to that action keeps possession of the heart and operates almost without intermission It constantly suggests images and sentiments fit to increase its strength and assist its operation We are in pain when we cannot exert it to act upon it is a pleasure For things most disagreeable in themselves custom creates a relish By practice therefore the heart must become not only pliable but bent to sin and acquire first a facility and next a pleasure in committing it A very few acts will give a beginning to vicious habit and as soon as it has begun to be formed it will render our vicious actions very frequent Every action is recommended by the same temptation as the first and to its influence the power of custom is superadded For exertion against their combined force you cannot inculcate any motive which you have not already baffled  If thou hast run with the footmen and  they have wearied thee how then canst thou contend with horses  Jer xii  The crime which you once hazarded with hesitation and reserve you will now perpetrate boldly and embrace with complacency Your conduct is no longer stained by some transient misdeeds it is contaminated in its general tenour Formerly you only fell before a strong temptation but now the slenderest temptation is irresistible you will not even wait for a temptation from without there is a permanent temptation within your own breasts You will not now run into one sin and then regret it but you will hasten through a train of vicious conduct and then awake to a course of sorrow remorse and selfreproach The period of the former will become continually more extended and more flagitious and that of the latter shorter and less agonizing  THE same construction of the human soul which fits us for contracting habits renders it unavoidable that every habit which we have contracted should continually increase in strength▪ It forces us to act upon it and by being acted upon it is confirmed A vicious habit needs only to be planted as naturally as a tree flourishes in its proper soil it will  quickly advance to a prodigious size From each of the many indulgences to which it daily compels you it will draw abundant nourishment Actuated by habit you will commit sin with growing pleasure you will become expert in committing it and more and more intent upon it When a twig is bent at first it will by its own elasticity recover its rectitude as soon as the force is removed but by continuing to bend it long you may fix it in a curvature which can scarcely be corrected Vicious habit will by degrees become so stubborn as to baffle all ordinary efforts to extirpate it It destroys selfgovernment it puts the passions in possession of all the strong holds of the heart you will find it difficult either to dislodge them or to check their eruptions The pain that attends your endeavours to forbear gratifying inclinations which have become habitual adds much to the seeming value of the gratification and the sense of that pain together with the perverse tendency of your own heart will render your pursuit of it keener than in proportion to your most extravagant idea of its value You no longer need the view of profit or of pleasure to entice you to a sinful action you have acquired a fixt attachment to it you run into it of course without reflecting on any precise motive or proposing any determinate consequences Even  the experience of ill consequences proceeding from it is insufficient to prevent your soon returning to the commission of it The drunkard whom Solomon describes who had drowned sense and reason on awaking to the exercise of them found himself bruised and wounded he knew not how and complained bitterly  they have stricken me and I was not sick they have beaten me and I felt it not  nevertheless he immediately said  I will seek it yet again  Prov xxiii  The whoremonger the thief the robber the oppressor the miser the malicious the sinner of every denomination meets with many severe checks and chastisements in the prosecution of his vice by which he notwithstanding cannot be reclaimed Habit necessarily engenders thoughtleslness actions to which we are habituated we do often every day without either being conscious of it at the time or recollecting it afterwards Vicious habit extinguishes reflection The voice of conscience is heard seldomer and more faintly Its languid opposition is so far from repressing the irregularity of passion or vanquishing the propensity of habit that it increases their strength To overcome it they collect and exert their utmost force and having quickly overcome it they will go on with the same  accumulated force driving you headlong into sin By the long and customary practice of any vice it will become predominant within you it is dear to you as your  right hand  or your  right eye  Mat v  you regard it as an intimate part of the constitution of your soul Your heart is set upon indulging it you think it impossible to live without it What once you shunned as a dangerous temptation you now court as a desirable opportunity You are careful to embrace it and by often finding and often embracing it your conduct is rendered habitually vicious at least in one particular  BUT your degeneracy will not be long confined to one particular While from a single act that vice to which your favourite passion or your peculiar situation has first betrayed you is ripening into habit many other vices will take root and thrive beneath its shelter Numberless are the ways in which one sin grows out of anotherThe commission of any sin weakens the habit of any sin destroys our defence against every sin and lays us open to it It inures us to make light of obligation and prepares us to disobey its dictates without distinction It breaks the balance and unhinges  the order of our powers they can no longer operate on one another as mutual checks It dissolves the soul in anarchy amidst which like violence in a country void of government every irregular passion rages unheeded and uncontrouled and from which it finds occasions of fulfilling all its pleasure Whatever be the sin a temptation to which attacks the heart in this state of distraction it must prevail There is too much uproar and confusion within to admit a strict examination or a vigorous resistance Every vice produces likewise peculiar effects favourable to the practice of other vices Some enervate the soul and render it effeminate some contract or debase the heart and some make it callous and unfeelingBy thus debauching the heart from virtue the practice of the smallest sins will make way for your committing the greatest Men commonly begin with some lesser acts of vice there are atrocious crimes at the thought of which they would yet shudder But if a small sin once gain admittance because it is but small another will likewise gain admittance because it is but a little greater and the same foolish deceit will lead you forward step by step to the most enormous transgressions When conscience is defiled these will not appear more horrid to it than the slenderest offence did when it was fair and  uncorrupted When you have brought yourselves to commit any sin you will soon commit another more aggravated with less uneasiness If you suffer any of the malevolent passions to vent themselves in expressions of contempt and slight they will quickly be poured out in bitter reproach and invective and next proceed to violent contentions fierce quarrels and gross injuries If you accustom yourselves to the use of foolish terms of asseveration or exclamation in your discourse it will gradually reconcile you to swearing vainly by the name of God after a while the slightest provocation or impatience will burst forth into oaths and imprecations then neither provocation nor impatience will be necessary rashly for the merest trifles without consideration of the truth or the falsehood the moment or the consequences of the matter you will heap oaths and curses on one another and by thoughtlessly multiplying oaths in your ordinary conversation you will at length come to despise them and venture without much scruple on premeditated perjury when you have a strong temptation to it Peter at first simply denied that he had been with Jesus next he denied it with an oath the third time he denied with  cursing and swearing that he knew the man  Mat xxvi Mark xiv  To suffer yourselves to be betrayed  into any sin by an imagination that it is small is to consent that you shall gradually but unavoidably be drawn on to the most heinous sins  IT is not only by its tendency to introduce a general depravation of heart that one sin leads men forward to other sins it likewise begets many strong temptations to them The natural progeny of every vice is numerous With whatever vice you begin you will find many others inseparably connected with it To instance in the sensual vices to which young persons are commonly most exposed  whoredom and wine take away the heart  Hos iv  intemperance of every kind intoxicates and stupifies like a strong opiate it infatuates the soul it disposes to and when it has become habitual it implies the neglect of all the duties which we owe to ourselves our families and our friends Lewdness destroys all regard to decency and reputation wears away the sense of shame and produces impudence and effrontery in doing and in avowing the most flagitious actions When Joseph rejected the solicitation of his mistress to commit adultery his chastity upbraided her immodesty his continued refusal at once inflamed and disappointed her lust  she could scarce be but exasperated and incensed against him and revenge and fury of course dictated the complication of falsehood and cruelty which she found means to execute against him Drunkenness makes a man incapable of the attention and recollection which is necessary for his doing right in any case and exposes him an easy prey to every crime If thou art addicted to it  thine eye shall behold strange women and thine heart shall utter perverse things  Prov xxiii  thy tongue shall be abusive thine hand shall be in quarrels perhaps in bloodshed  yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea or as he that lieth on the top of a mast  Ver  ready every moment to plunge into an abyss of wickednessIt would be too tedious to attempt enumerating all the ways in which one sin lays men under temptation to other sins some of them it will be proper to mention  ONE sin will generally demand new sins in order to conceal it Evil is ashamed of itself it cannot bear to be looked upon To a novice in vice detection appears insupportable and often it would have consequences which the greatest proficient in vice trembles at the thought of incurring What he has done must  be concealed by any means Dissimulation lying murder it may be is the only means of concealment It must be perpetrated infamy punishment ruin cannot be otherwise avoided When you have already given up yourselves to one vice it cannot be expected that you should meet these rather than commit another When David knew that Bathsheba had conceived he necessarily became anxious to prevent a discovery of his adultery it could not be prevented without his consenting to some additional baseness and his anxiety led him into a series of the blackest designs He first attempted to impose a spurious offspring on one of the bravest and most faithful of his captains but the attempt was defeated by Uriah's scrupulous attachment to a nice point of honour The king made another effort to accomplish the imposition he wheedled him into drunkenness that wine might inflame his passion but the same delicacy of honour preserved him from the snare The horrors of a discovery and the just resentment of an abused servant stare David in the face they drive him on to the most violent and atrocious methods of averting them there are no others and they must be adopted Uriah is perfidiously sacrificed to the sword his courage his fidelity and his zeal are employed for his destruction many brave men are devoted along  with him and Joab is made a guilty accomplice in the butchery  Sam xi ▪ c  Complicated and enormous is the villany but the concealment of a former sin demands it  ONE sinful action much more a continued course of sin will sometimes involve men in such a labyrinth that they cannot extricate themselves without new sin To whatever hand they turn they seem to be under a necessity of doing wrong If they go forward they plunge themselves deeper into guilt and if they return it must be by committing a greater sin than what they have already committed No choice is left them but between one crime and another▪ They are like mariners in a storm to pursue their course is to be swallowed up by the ocean to steer for a haven is to be wrecked upon the rocks Saul had denounced with an oath the death of him who should violate his rash adjuration to taste no food Jonathan had unknowingly tasted a little honey and incurred the punishment and his father could avoid the injustice and cruelty of inflicting it only by breaking his oath  Sam xiv  Herod in an hour of dissipation swore to give the daughter of Herodias whatever she should ask when she asked the head  of John what could he fix upon If he refused he forfeited his promise in the presence of his officers and lords and the  chief estates of Galilee  He thought this so dishonourable and base that he chose rather in performance of his oath to put to death a righteous man a prophet nay one greater than a prophet  Mark vi c  Engaged in vice you must either plunge into all the crimes naturally consequent upon it or infringe gratitude friendship honour fidelity in retreating Perhaps the real fault lies only in your having reduced yourselves to so perplexing an alternative and to embrace the only means of retreat has but the appearance of faultiness But you will probably think otherwise vice commonly produces a perversion of sentiment and insinuates false maxims of honour by means of which what an unhappy peculiarity of situation has rendered right and necessary shocks more than what is absolutely wrong You will go on but find no end till you sink into perdition  ONE indulged vice will always require many others for its support and execution Avarice will not long be satisfied with the gratification which penurious savings or toilsome  drudgery can bring for feeding itself it will soon come to intercept the gift of charity the retribution of gratitude the oblation of benevolence and it will next exact the practice of every dishonest art of making gain Lust cannot effectuate its purposes without often employing deceit falsehood seduction and inflicting injury the deepest and the most irreparable The expensive vices cannot be continued without submitting to supply their demands by covetousness injustice fraud or rapine Every one among you who has for the shortest time addicted himself to any vicious course knows by certain experience that in pursuing it he has been forced to commit many other vices For these subsidiary vices you perhaps have no inclination they are even perfectly abhorrent from your nature but you must either consent to them or abstain from your darling sin Contrary propensions may for a while struggle within you and distract your soul you may shudder at the thought of what you must do you may start back and again start back and wish and purpose to leave the deed undone But the darling sin requires it and it has got firm possession of your heart reason conscience nature itself resist in vain that sin will at length prevail and drive you into whatever  crimes shall become necessary for accomplishing its ends  BY repeated acts the several vices into which your favourite sin betrays you will likewise become habitual What you at first only endured for the sake of something else you will in time acquire a proneness to perpetrate for its own sake and take delight in perpetrating Your vice will not only grow inveterate but also spread like a gangrene It will at once strike its roots deeper and extend its branches wider What was in the beginning like a handful of small seeds grows at last into a forest of lofty cedars Your souls are overrun with vicious habits continually increasing in strength and number and fixing you in all manner of unrighteousness  WHILE vice is thus rising to maturity by the strength of those principles of growth which it contains within itself it will likewise seek nourishment from every thing external that can supply itIt will lay itself open to all the influence of ill example The corrupted heart has a fixt bias to the society and the imitation of the vicious Whatever be its present temper whether passion or conscience predominates for the time it pants for the company of the wicked with equal eagerness  When your vicious passions rage they will drive you into it that you may find the opportunity of indulging them and encouragement to give them full scope When conscience resumes its place and cuts you with its rebukes you will flee from the torment of your own reflections to the haunts of evildoers that the levity of the thoughtless may divert your remorse or that the audacity of hardier sinners may embolden you to disregard it From every advance which you make in vice ill example will acquire additional power to push you forward The greater your own depravity is the more easily you will be reconciled to vice by the custom of seeing it practised You will scarcely need to be instigated by the propensity to imitation you are under the dominion of those very passions from which it directly proceeds By associating together sinners keep one another in countenance in prosecuting their evil courses and are mutually incited to the prosecution of them by the sentiments excuses and recommendations which they in their turns suggest By yielding to the example and entering into the society of the vicious you will become more hardened in the vice to which you are already addicted and you will be seduced into many others to which you have naturally no disposition In the character of every  wicked man along with the vices which are properly of his own growth there are some which have been planted and reared solely by the influence of company and example To this cause the sin of customary swearing common as it is must be totally referred there is no natural temptation to it in the constitution or temperament of any human creature Even a natural disinclination to a particular vice will soon be conquered by the force of ill example if your chosen intimates be devoted to it you will learn to copy it from them The man whom nature had endued with the quickest sense of honour has often been enticed into the meanest practices The man whom nature had fortified by an absolute aversion to intoxicating liquors has often become a drunkard sometimes the most abandoned to debauchery The modestest youth has sometimes degenerated into the most shameless libertine To frequent the assemblies of the wicked is to take up your abode in a house filled with the contagion of every mortal disease  O my soul come not thou into their secret  Gen xlix    Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity  Psal vi    IN whatever degree your vice becomes habitual it will have a tendency proportionably  to alienate you from all the means of curbing it It will incapacitate you for the devout observance of religious ordinances it will lead you on to the neglect of them and from your coldness or neglect it will draw fresh vigour It will weaken your faith of the great principles of religion which condemn it deaden your sense of them draw off your attention from them and deprive you of their aid in resisting it Conscience will remonstrate less frequently and less warmly the farther you proceed and when it does remonstrate you will with greater and greater anxiety and success set yourselves to silence it You cannot think of forsaking your sins and therefore you will study to make yourselves easy in them Every step you take you will the more eagerly grasp at those false opinions and licentious sentiments which seem to justify or extenuate your sins and they will become the more effectual for encouraging you to take another step You will the more solicitously avail yourselves of all the evasions and subterfuges of selfdeceit and in every stage of your progress it will furnish some artful distinction some delusive maxim some plausible disguise adapted to your situation and calculated for producing security in it  As long as your practice is confined to one favourite vice which has not yet seduced you  into the frequent commission of others you will soothe yourselves into the fearless indulgence of it by a fond persuasion that it alone is not sufficient to denominate you vicious men You are faulty in  this  one  thing  but in it  the Lord  will surely  pardon his servants  Kings v  you nevertheless have many virtues these may make amends for one fault and by means of these you may hope for the rewards of heaven It is but a necessary imperfection inseparable from fallen man No human character was ever uniformly excellent the purest has had some stains and the brightest some dark shades Every one of the holy men whom the Scripture most commends failed in some particular and some of them were guilty of very heinous sins You therefore may well be allowed in your peculiar frailty But between the acts of sin into which good men have sometimes been surprized and the practice of sin in which you live between the temporary defections for which they mourned and the customary transgressions which you justify to yourselves between the iniquities from which they speedily recovered themselves by repentance and those in which you deliberately resolve to persist there is the widest difference If you live in the habit of  any one sin you are as truly though not in so high a degree wilful and presumptuous sinners as they who abandon themselves to more God is so far from granting you allowance in your beloved vice that against it he requires you to employ your most special care  WHEN any vicious passion by being confirmed into habit has become so powerful that it conquers you on every the slightest temptation you will begin to flatter yourselves that therefore it is only a sin of infirmity for which God will never call you to a rigorous account Though you fall so often before it you approve it not you submit not quietly to its dominion you form frequent purposes against it but still it prevails over the sense of your minds and overthrows your strongest purposes and this convinces you that it arises unavoidably from the frailty of your nature and will find an easy pardon To facilitate the deception you will labour to persuade yourselves that it is but a small trespass and no vice is so enormous but exorbitant passion may impose it on a corrupted conscience as a small trespass You compare your own sins with the most flagitious practices of other men and because you perceive them to be less you conclude them to be venal You do not scoff at religion though you neglect all its duties  you oppress not your dependents to absolute ruin though you harass them with severity you are not murderers though you be injurious you live not in adultery though you indulge yourselves in whoredom you are not sunk into the sottishness of solitary drunkenness though you never scruple to join in the riots of your company If all the partiality of selfdeceit cannot represent your sin as small in itself you will extenuate it into a sin of infirmity by referring it to the peculiarity of your temper or your situation it is so deeply rooted in your constitution it grows so necessarily out of your circumstances or occupation it is so inseparably connected with your interest and views that to you it is inevitable and you must be pardonable in yielding to it But you deceive yourselves That only can be a sin of infirmity which proceeds from excuseable ignorance or sudden surprise What is contrary to an express command of God what you know to be at all a sin at the time of committing it what needs refinement for reconciling it to the native sentiments of your hearts must merit a very different name It is a known deliberate wilful disobedience of your Maker By gross abuse of yourselves you have first contracted strong habits of vice and now when their strength is irresistible you foolishly imagine that they are therefore but  pitiable frailties The imagination is so desperately absurd as necessarily to imply that the more inveterate your vices are become the more they are intitled to indulgence and forgiveness If you can infatuate yourselves into the belief of it you may obtain tranquillity in your customary sins but you will at the same time harden yourselves in them and prevent your ever thinking of that repentance without which they must issue in your eternal ruin  SOMETIMES again the habitual sinner quiets his conscience by devising superstitious equivalents for the virtue which he suffers himself to violate He cannot abandon his vices but he will make amends for them he will punctiliously observe all the rituals of religion he will believe all its doctrines he will be most violently zealous against those whom he conceives to be erroneous The ambitious the covetous the unjust the voluptuous will make any atonement any compensation which does not preclude him from the indulgence of his beloved vice and by persuading himself that it will avail he is lulled into a fatal security Hence the characters in which the shifts of avarice the tricks of dishonesty the revellings of debauchery or the arts of ambition are unnaturally conjoined with a high  profession of religion and a presumptuous conceit of extraordinary sanctity  FINALLY when habitual sinners can find no means of concealing from themselves the turpitude of those vices to which they are addicted they notwithstanding reconcile their minds to the perpetration of them by some imperfect motions of present repentance or halfresolutions of future reformation You condemn yourselves in what you do you regret every act of sin as soon almost as it is done you lament that you are not better and wish earnestly that you were and you hope that this is repentance and shows your heart to be right however faulty your conduct be If there be any defect in this you will supply it hereafter you cannot think of encountering the difficulties of a complete reformation at present but at a more convenient season when you have enjoyed your sins a little longer you are determined that you will accomplish it Strange to pervert those checks and rebukes of conscience which proclaim your guilt into an evidence that you are guiltless to dream that your sinning against conviction is repentance to conclude that God will not condemn you because you cannot help condemning yourselves Your resolutions are as full of absurdity as your  sentiments at the very time you are doing an action you resolve to disapprove and condemn it afterwards you resolve that hereafter when it shall be impossible to undo it you will heartily wish that undone which you will not leave undone now when it is absolutely in your power to abstain from doing it A resolution to repent hereafter is inconsistent with every degree of honesty of heartand it never will be executed every impediment to present reformation every difficulty in effecting it every reason for delay will continue and daily gather strength You may repeat and again repeat your resolution to reform but you will never set about actual reformation While you regret that you are sinning and yet go on while you resolve to amend and amend not immediately you are the slaves of sin and likely to die in bondage to it  Today while it is called today harden not your hearts  Heb iii    WHEN we thus display the long train of wickedness which springs naturally and unavoidably from the least vicious indulgence you perhaps consider it as in a great measure the work of imagination You think you can easily go a short way in vice when your pleasure  or your interest requires it without any danger of becoming abandoned to it You have already ventured on some acts of sin but you are certain that you can forbear them when you please you have yielded to your favourite vice and you have found no necessary connexion between it and other vices But can you say that you have found no connexion Perhaps you have not yet run into them But have you not been sometimes tempted to them Has never your customary sin hinted that you might make trial of them Yes but you abhor them Rather than be guilty of them you will renounce the most beloved vice This may be your present opinion after custom has effaced a man's detestation of familiar sins he may continue to regard a higher degree or another species of guilt with horror But by a little longer practice this likewise will be effaced and that very guilt incurred without scruple Recollect Hazael and be alarmed for yourselves You cannot feel stronger indignation against any crime than he expressed when the Prophet foretold his future enormities  Is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing  Kings viii  His ambition was yet young but it quickly rose to strength and drove him into all the barbarities  which he had so confidently disclaimed The effects of wickedness are always carried far beyond the sinner's first design Nothing could prevail upon you to leap from the top of a high tower but by an easy scale of steps you will without fear descend to the very same depth From the first wilful transgression to confirmation in wickedness the descent is so easy that every transition is scarcely perceptible One act of sin in many ways induces the repetition of it repetition necessarily forms a habit of it the habit impels to frequent practice and by practice becomes inveterate The practice the habit of one sin leads on to other sins prepares the soul for greater crimes begets temptations to them demands them for concealing it involves you in them as its inevitable consequences or imposes them upon you as necessary for its support and execution and quickly rears them also into established habits Habitual vice lays you open to all the power of ill example to all the influence of loose principles to all the artifices of selfdeceit and by means of these you will become irreclaimable and yet fearless in all your vicious courses Smooth and often rapid is the progress but fatal is the issue  How carefully then ought they who have yet retained their innocence still to hold it  fast You cannot guess beforehand of what depravity trouble and misery you lay the foundation when you make the first step into a bad course Fully retrieved it can never be However early you retract it it must be with pungent sorrow with painful struggling and with a consciousness of guilt never to be totally obliterated But it is not probable that you will retract it early a downward motion is not easily repressed If you commit one sin you can hardly avoid committing many more if you commit many sins you must contract strong vicious habits and if these be once contracted they will render you the irredeemable slaves of vice It is with a trembling heart that the virtuous friend or the attentive parent sees the inexperienced youth engaging in the commerce of the world a few of his first steps may very probably determine his character through life and his state through eternity  How then shall we address those who have already proceeded far in vicious courses Your condition is imminently dangerous You are going straight forward in the road to destruction and the farther you have gone the more violently you are compelled to go farther Stop short while yet there is a possibility However little a way you have proceeded  you will find abundant difficulty in returning another step will make a great addition to it You cannot pass at once from the path of vice into that of virtue they touch only at their entrance in their progress they separate to an unmeasurable distance to cross into the path of virtue will require more laborious and tedious exertions than you have made in wandering from it it is like toiling up a steep ascent where the sand is continually slipping from beneath your feet and frustrates more than half your effort By every hour's continuance in evil courses the power of sin is strengthened the vigour of the soul impaired and the principles of reformation weakened How seldom is the practised sinner perfectly recovered to virtue  Be not therefore without fear to add sin unto sin  any more  make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord and put not off from day to day for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed and perish in the day of vengeance  Ecclus v ▪  By immediate reformation you will prevent it if you defer it for a day it may be for ever beyond your power  SERMON III THE PROGRESS OF VICE THE THIRD STAGE  JEREM ix  They proceed from evil to evil  IT is a common prejudice against religion that it is for some time difficult and painful at least to such as have been formerly engaged in vicious courses who must undergo a severe discipline of mortification and selfdenial before they can find any pleasure in it Against religion it is but a prejudice for its joys are more than sufficient to compensate all the pains which we can endure in acquiring a relish for them But against vice it is an unanswerable argument that its beginnings occasion racking pains which it has no solid joys to counterbalance To every welldisposed mind a heinous sin is at first the object of dread and horror Before a man can think without reluctance of committing  it before he can set about it without trepidation of heart and confusion of face before he can reflect on it without pungent remorse and selfcondemnation he must not only suffer many an uneasy struggle within between the irregular passions which urge him to it and conscience which forbids it but he must likewise by many outward actions of baseness intermingled with seasons of dissatisfaction and dread wear out all the principles of modesty and ingenuity which were the glory of his nature By perseverance in wickedness he may at length become easy in it but his ease is only stupesaction in guilt and security on the brink of destruction It is founded in the corruption of his heart it is always in proportion to the inveteracy of that corruption it is the desperate period of a mortal dist  mper in which a man is crushed beneath its power thinks not of a remedy or becomes fond of his disease Instead of a recommendation of vice it is one of the strongest arguments against it and when we consider how insensibly and almost unavoidably the man who is once engaged in vice is drawn forward to this state of mind the argument becomes truly alarming I have proposed to enforce it by tracing out the sinner's progress  from evil to evil  In pursuing this design I have  first  pointed out those steps of mental  indulgence by which irregular inclinations and vicious passions are inwardly cherished till they break forth into overt acts of sin and  secondly  those steps by which in consequence of wilful sin vicious habits are contracted strengthened and multiplied and I shall now in the  third  place endeavour to describe the confirmation of the corrupted heart in profligate wickedness and enmity against religion  IN pointing out the sinner's progress to habitual vice we have observed that his aversion to it his reluctance to practise it and his pain in the consciousncss of it continually grow weaker At length they are almost totally effaced he becomes  insensible  to its baseness and its wretchedness Insensibility in sin is the necessary consequence of being enured to it and it forms a principal part of its maturity Custom which strengthens our active propensities never fails to weaken passive impressions the frequent sight of distress blunts the emotions of pity the being often exposed to danger impairs the sensation of fear the being long forced to bear insults and indignities deadens the pungency of that mortification with which they are felt at first The custom of committing sin wears off the the uneasiness the shame and the dread  which the thought of it once produced Conscience which formerly eyed it with horror remonstrated against it and faithfully represented its baseness and its misery becomes so blind that it cannot see the evil of sin so heedless that it will not reprove it or so debauched that it excuses and defends it Its strongest checks and its sharpest rebukes have been despised or eluded and now it ceases from them it is become  seared with a hot iron  Tim iv  it is reprobate and undiscerning But were the conscience of the habitual sinner still capable of continuing its rebukes and sounding them ever so loudly in his ears he could not hear them he has so often heard and disregarded them that they can make no impression He is like a person who having always lived near to a noisy cataract has lost the very perception of its roaring Sin is of a benumbing stupifying nature in its earliest stages the sinner slumbers in its last stage  the spirit of deep sleep is fallen upon him  Isa xxix  a lethargy oppresses all his powers He is  past feeling  Eph iv  His mind is as a member of the body that is mortified it has no sense of the most flagitious crimes In the nervous language of Scripture he is even  dead in trespasses  and sins  Chap ii  Nay he has made his heart an  heart of stone  Ezek xxxvi    as an adamant stone lest he should hear the law  Zech vii    IN this state of obduracy the sinner can reflect upon the most heinous particulars of his abandoned conduct without sorrow or regret Long custom of sinning has taken away the consciousness of his guilt Remorse which never fails to wound the tender heart of a novice in vice cannot touch the callous soul of the proficient The yoke of sin no longer galls his neck he has  hardened  it he has  made it an iron sinew  Jer vii Isa xlviii  Habituated to the slavery of sin he forgets his chains In a condition which by all the declarations of the gospel excludes him from the happiness of heaven and which in its own nature renders him incapable of happiness he sits down secure and unconcerned without a desire of reformation without one thought of altering his course  WHEN the sinner can make himself easy under the load of guilt which he has already contracted he will likewise go on without reluctance to contract new guilt The same depravity which smothers remorse for former  crimes precludes repugnance to fresh transgressions Whenever conscience ceases from its rebukes it of course gives over its remonstrances As often as an opportunity occurs the hardened sinner runs into vice without thought without almost knowing that he is doing wrong He has freed himself from every restraint By his being so long addicted to what is base his conscience is silenced his detestation and dread of sin his sense of its vile and shameful nature and his apprehensions of its miserable consequences are in a great measure lost He thinks neither of the goodness of God nor of his wrath He regards not the obligations of virtue nor any of the motives of the gospel The modesty which he possessed in his early wanderings from duty has forsaken him he has no respect to his own character or to the opinion of others he abandons himself to sin in broad daylight without a mask without a blush It must be a very atrocious deed from which he will start back He is like those who are reported to have rendered poison so familiar to them by the custom of swallowing it that they could digest a great quantity of it without any sensation of pain By a course of rebellion against conscience he has not only broken its power but learned to despise its authority  BY being long habituated to vice a man becomes not only insensible but likewise  inflexible  and irreclaimable These two characters are so closely connected that the Scripture includes both under the same term  hardness of heart  Both are clearly discernible in the descriptions which it gives of the obduracy with which the Prophets and the Messiah so often charge the degenerate Jews Of the insensibility which we have just now described obstinate adherence to vice is the necessary consequence In every nature there is originally a principle of selfrestoration when it is a little put out of order it labours to recover itself Storms and tempests are the agitations of the elements endeavouring to discharge the noxious vapours which have infected them and they are succeeded by a wholesome calm Agues and fevers in the human body are the struggles of its remaining vigour to expel some malignant humours which threaten its dissolution and when they cease without producing this effect a broken constitution or speedy death ensues Vice is the disorder the disease the misery of moral agents as long as the mind retains any soundness it makes efforts to throw it off regret remorse selfcondemnation consideration of the reasons for virtue resolutions of amendment are no other than its motions towards  repentance its endeavours after reformation When by perseverance in wickedness they are suppressed the very principle of selfrestitution is lost the distemper is incurable When a man is unaffected with all the sins which he has committed how can he think of forsaking them When he has no sense of the evil of sin how can he be brought to abhor and avoid it His sleep will be a perpetual sleep To arouse him would be to give feeling to a mortified limb or motion to a dead carcase He is blind to all moral considerations he is impenetrable by exhortation by reproof by the mercies by the judgments of God by all incentives to amendment There is nothing remaining in his soul on which they can take hold In spite of all possible motives to virtue he has obstinately pursued his wicked courses they could not restrain him when they operated with their full force how then can they reclaim him now when by being often bassled they have lost their force and when by the inveteracy of habit he is steeled against them In a Christian hardness of heart has been contracted in contempt of all the means of recovery which the gospel can supply they might reform a heathen but for correcting his depravity a new revelation of greater efficacy than the gospel would seem to be necessary None such will be given  and therefore the apostle affirms that  it is impossible  he cannot mean less than that it is so difficult as scarcely to be expected  for those who are once enlightened if they shall fall away  so far as to become obdurate sinners  to renew them again unto repentance  Heb vi  Were they even indulged with a new revelation it is not probable that they would repent After the Jews had in contempt of Moses and the Prophets become obdurate in wickedness the gospel was granted to them but they trampled it likewise under foot remained impenitent and made a dreadful addition to their guilt  THE inflexibility of the hardened sinner is secured not only by his insensibility but by the strength of his vicious habits How difficult it is to break off any habit even the most insignificant the experience of every day proclaims A confirmed habit few have resolution to attempt eradicating The labour the care the constancy of vigilance which it requires is almost incredible After the pains of years it is discovered that some fibre has remained which shoots anew and demands a repetition of the toil How then can deeprooted habits of vice be extirpated Could the hardened sinner feel the whole  force of all the arguments for undertaking the extirpation of them they scarcely could prevail His habits are become too stubborn to bend before them they are too much indurated to yield to the edge of reason By length of time the habits of the mind as well as the members of the body become stiff and rigid The man who has through life accustomed himself to sin is chained fast by his lusts and in chains what can he do for his own release He has not the power to reform though he had the inclination He has gone so far that he is frightened at the length and ruggedness of the way by which he must return he doubts whether it be possible despondence suspends all his powers and deprives him of all heart to purpose it The Scripture therefore describes hardened sinners as not only  abominable and disobedient  but also  unto every good work reprobate  Tit i  so far  alienated from the life of God  as to  have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness  Eph iv  in  the snare of the Devil taken captive by him at his will  Tim ii  The stain of sin may sink so deep as to tincture the soul throughout The habit of wickedness becomes a second nature the whole propension of the heart is as much to sin as the tendency of a stone to  fall or of sparks to fly upwards to correct it is almost as difficult as to alter the original powers of the mind By wallowing in sensuality men may be degraded into beasts by resigning themselves to malevolence they may be transformed into fiends The incorrigible obstinacy of habitual sinners and the desperate danger of their condition is emphatically expressed by the Prophet  Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil  Jer xiii  But if you will observe with what composure and perseverance you see the miser continuing his penurious shifts the rapacious multiplying his rapines the unjust executing his villanies the drunkard repeating his debauches the profligate of every denomination pursuing his own course to the very last you can scarcely imagine even that description to be exaggerated  Is it then impossible that they who have become hardened in vicious courses should be reclaimed from them  With men  I am afraid we must determine  this is impossible but with God all things are possible  Mat xix  It can be effected only by an extraordinary measure of divine grace but they have no reason to expect so much as the ordinary influences of  grace They are totally estranged from the means which he has appointed for conveying it how can they find access to it They have continually resisted the spirit of God and in defiance of all his motions proceeded to so extreme depravity he will be provoked to cease from his suggestions and to withdraw his aids They have so long refused to hearken to the voice of God that he will  give them up unto their own hearts lusts to walk in their own counsels  Psal lxxxi  He will employ no farther methods for their reformation  Why should ye be striken any more Ye will revolt more and more  Isa i    He that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear  Ezek iii  he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he that is filthy let him be filthy still  Rev xxii  When Divine justice thus pronounceth concerning the habitual sinner his condition is irretrievable Without Divine grace he cannot be awakened even to think of repenting without a great degree of its assistance he cannot accomplish his repentance but he has totally forfeited its aids  That which is crooked  in him  cannot be made straight  Eccl i  His perversity will increase every day and  after his hardness and impenitent  heart he treasureth up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath  Rom ii    BY long custom of sinning men become not only blind to the evil of sin and confirmed in the practice of it but likewise fond of it They not only commit it but approve it and glory in it  Even their mind and conscience is defiled  Tit i  their moral sentiments are totally reversed  they call evil good and good evil and put darkness for light and light for darkness  Isa v  They have so transfigured their vices and so vitiated their judgment as to reckon them commendable They have so audaciously trampled upon obligation that they applaud themselves in despising it They forget that ever they heard the voice of conscience and therefore persuade themselves that its dictates are impostures and that virtue and vice are empty names  Fools make a mock at sin  Prov xiv  and turn duty unto ridicule The drunkard boasts of his beastly debauches and laughs at temperance as an insipid dull precision The dissolute libertine triumphs in the multitude of his impurities and sneers at modesty as spiritless austerity The practised villain pours contempt on the restraints  of justice and values himself on the boldness with which he has broken through them the skill with which he has eluded them the address with which he has screened himself from the vengeance of the laws and the opulence which he possesses in consequence of his crimes The irreligious jeers at the fervours of devotion as mere enthusiasm at the regular performance of its duties as ceremonious formality weak superstition or studied hypocrisy and exults in his own impiety as refinement of spirit and superiority of mind The sinner of every class when he has pursued his evil courses to a great length sets himself down  in the seat of the scornful  Psal i  and makes right and wrong the subjects of his slight his mirth or his satire  IN the earlier periods of their degeneracy▪ men sometimes venture to treat particular acts of virtue or vice with derision or even to jest with the sanctity and the importance of moral obligation In that case it is the effusion of unthinking levity it is the illjudged affectation of with and pleasantry it is the heedless mimickry of the profane scoffer it is an assumed disguise of inward pangs from consciousness of guilt or it is a fond attempt  to obtain tranquillity in vices which they have not resolution to forsake It is belied by the real sentiments of their hearts and intermixt with checks of conscience and misgivings of soul From whatever cause it proceeds it is foolish and highly culpable and it is of the most pernicious consequence It gradually saps the authority of conscience lessens the power of its decrees wears off the reverence due to virtue and prepares the way for regarding sin as a light and trivial failing But in the veteran sinner it proceeds from causes which lie deeper and it implies the blackest corruption His temper is a contradiction to virtue and therefore he hates it and supports his hatred by representing it as contemptible Vice has interwoven itself with all the exertions of his soul and therefore he studiously justifies and commends it His scoffing is not the unmeaning jest of giddiness but the designing sneer of malignity It is the effect of that false peace which by smothering his sense of right and wrong he has obtained in adding sin to sin It is indulged with eagerness and complacence  the scorners delight in their scorning  Prov i  Such perversion of heart precludes almost the possibility of repentance It empoisons all the springs from which repentance  can proceed it throws ridicule on all the sentiments which can instigate to reformation When a man has long addicted himself to any course this alone is often sufficient to make him ashamed to alter it but when he has moreover set himself on every occasion to maintain and applaud it to expose and vilify the contrary course and to deride those who pursue it how can he have the courage to resolve upon amendment His jests would be all retorted on himself he must encounter not the scoffs of others only but his own He hates to be reformed  SCOFFING at the practice of religion is sometimes united with belief of its principles They who would think with horror of denying the existence of God glory in living  without God in the world  Eph ii  They who would shudder at disbelieving a future state laugh at that conduct which alone can qualify them for happiness in it They who retain considerable reverence for the truths of the gospel of Christ treat with contempt a  conversation becoming the gospel  Phil i  The inconsistence the absurdity of their character is astonishing they deride what their avowed principles demand as indespensible they boast of what their own principles demonstrate to be their disgrace and  misery It shews to what a deplorable pitch vice can infatuate the soul it besets it into such stupidity that it cannot discern the most palpable repugnances  BUT very often the derision of the scorner extends itself to the principles of religion The most sacred venerable and important truths the being of God the external state of retribution the divinity of the gospel its excellence its sublime doctrines its precious promises its awful threatenings are made the chosen objects of his scurrilous wit and dissolute mirth If any of these have been misunderstood through the weakness of believers the undesigned misrepresentation is greedily laid hold of unfairly substituted in place of the reality exaggerated to the utmost that it may the better receive the false colouring of ridicule In every step of his progress  from evil to evil  the sinner is gradually trained to this extremity of corruption and by obduracy in wickedness he is completely prepared for it The sportiveness of childhood and the vivacity of youth uncorrected by reverence for religious truth is sometimes found to overflow in an indecent jest on some principle which ought to be regarded as sacred and never mentioned but with seriousness Its being heard without  marks of disgust received with satisfaction or echoed back with the voice of mirth is an encouragement to the repetition of it By such communication men become indisposed to sedateness and fond of frivolous and jocular discourse The novice in vice panting for liberty to gratify his indulged passions or to palliate from himself and justify to others the deviations into which they have betrayed him catches at the licentious positions or the ludicrous images which he has learned from the proficient in wickedness inculcates them on his recoiling heart and produces them with seeming complacence but often with real compunction and mistrust When after having plunged himself into vice his conscience upbraids him and holds up to his view the great truths which condemn his conduct and proclaim his danger he labours to evade their force by whatever can disguise their certainty or debase their importance Intent on silencing conscience he necessarily directs his efforts against the truths from which it draws its sharpest weapons and if he be successful in silencing it there can be nothing to check him in throwing off the belief of these truths When he has become determined and contumacious in his vices he must be impatient of every restraint The tenets of religion are all  doctrines according to godliness  Tim vi  contradictory to every vice The abandoned to vice would gladly disbelieve them to confute them by arguments is above his power to destroy his reverence for them by profane scoffing▪ is an easier task and will almost as effectually secure his peace or perhaps facilitate his infidelity Inveterate habits of wickedness cannot fail to set men in opposition to religion which is incompatible with them This is the very account which our Saviour gives of the contempt and malice with which the Jews treated his instructions  They loved darkness rather than light  Why  Because their deeds were evil for every one that doth evil hateth the light lest his deeds should be reproved  John iii  Two of the Apostles ascribe to the same cause the impious mocking which they foretel was to take place in afterages  There shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own ungodly lusts sensual having not the spirit  Pet iii Jude    IF the person who extends his invective or his ridicule to the principles of religion avoids the inconsistency chargeable on him who laughs only at the practice of it he is guilty of an equal though dissimilar absurdity  and he shews deeper depravity of mind To misrepresent the tenets of religion is not wit but folly To be incapable of shining except by means of irreligion betrays a want of parts To contemn the most venerable things and to be merry with the most serious shows a shameful perversion of taste and sentiment To affect exposing by banter what you cannot confute by argument and what you have never examined with diligence implies a heart lost to every thing that is ingenuous in human nature If the principles of religion be true their importance must be confessed nothing short of a demonstration of their falsity can justify your treating them either with spite or with levity but the utmost effrontery of infidelity dare not boast of such a demonstration  WHEN men have contracted enmity against the truths of religion and accustomed themselves to treat them with contempt and derision how can they be reclaimed from wickedness God works repentance in sinners by his grace but he works it in a manner suitable to their reasonable nature He does not convert them by force as  the ships are turned about with a helm whithersoever the governor listeth  or as  we put bits in the horses  mouths that they may obey us  Jam iii  He operates upon them by principles of reason he persuades them by means of truths which infer the obligations of virtue But all these they regard as fables fit only to be laughed at Enured to despise the only means of amendment incapable of feeling their force they must be fixt in their impenitence  A scorner heareth not rebuke  Prov xiii  nor can be touched with exhortation Will God in some extraordinary way for all ordinary ways are rendered ineffectual awaken him to serious reflexion God himself has been the object of his blasphemy Will the compassion of the Son of God exert itself to soften the obduracy and correct the perversity of his soul The Son of God he reviles as an impostor Will the Holy Spirit by an irresistible impulse of his grace renew his corrupted heart It has been his constant practice to  do despite unto the spirit of grace  Heb x  His condition is determined his ruin is almost inevitable  IF the degree of wickedness hitherto described be susceptible of any aggravation it is when the sinner makes it his business to seduce others into vicious courses and it never fails to lead him forward to this summit of  guilt To assimilate others to ourselves is a desire natural to the soul When men are determined to persist in their vices and have laid aside every thought of reforming themselves they will become intent on perverting others into the same evil courses and forming them to the like character Many vices can be practised only in society the man who is addicted to them must search for fit associates and if he meets not with such as of choice  run with him to the same excess of riot  Pet iv  he must for enjoying his own vices draw them on to it Many vices cannot yield their full measure of advantage to him who delights in them except they be likewise practised by others the ruling passion of the miser receives a direct gratification from the parsimony of all who depend upon him as well as from his own penuriousness and will therefore instigate him to model them according to his own maxims dishonesty of every species requires accomplices or instruments for executing its schemes and must fashion them to its purposes by debauching them from all the principles of justice Every vice is kept in countenance by numbers and no vice is so completely satisfied with itself even in the most degenerate nature as not to grasp eagerly  at this appearance of patronage and labour to procure it A vitiated palate takes pleasure in the vilest favours a disordered mind is gratified by the most improper objects and a heart depraved into the love of vice cannot but feel an unnatural satisfaction in its prevalence To see others yielding to his influence or copying after his example though it be in wickedness gives the profligate an opinion of his own authority and importance that flatters the illegitimate and inverted pride for which his profligacy has prepared him So great is the corruption into which human nature may fall by continuance in vice that some find a positive and ultimate delight in seducing the thoughtless corrupting the innocent and encouraging the timid sinner to go greater lengths They will persuade or delude them into the most atrocious crimes They will scruple no method by which it can be accomplished They content not themselves with spreading vice by the most flagrant example they recommend it they set it off to the best advantage they employ all their art to produce enchanting pictures of it they point out the way to it they lead the reluctant by the hand into its darkest retreats they sedulously mock at whatever might prove a restraint from it Like the Jews who were  hardened  against the true religion  they  speak evil of that way before the multitude  Acts xix  Their enmity against religion is too rancorous to be confined within their own breasts it is not purely to gratify themselves that they pour it out they proclaim it with a sixt design and an anxious desire to communicate it to others They direct all their scoffs to the propagation of iniquity Shocking as this degree of wickedness is there have been many instances of it in every age Solomon describes it in several passages of his writings Evil men  speak froward things who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness who rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked  Prov ii    They say let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent let us swallow them up alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit  Chap i    They sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall  Chap iv  It is the temper of the fiend transplanted into the human breast it is to perform the vilest of the devil Go and find amusement in the horrors of the wretch who is hastening to the torture it were less inhuman than to sport with what must incur the wrath of God or to take pleasure in betraying men to the  perpetration of it The prostituted pander to wickedness must be nearly past redemption A conscience so thoroughly debauched cannot be restored to a vigorous sense of guilt a heart so completely obdurate cannot feel its sting The guilt is so dreadfully accumulated that a lively sense of it instead of impelling him to repentance would most probably overwhelm him with despair in thinking of the multitude of his sins and the numbers whom he has contributed to contaminate and ruin He ventures not to hope for mercy he cannot bring himself to pray for it his soul cannot frame a wish from which it has been so long and so far alienated By the hardness of his heart he knows that God withholds his grace If he feels that in all this God is just it aggravates his torture the long suffering of God abused and exhausted the purchase of Christ rejected and forfeited oppress him with unsufferable anguish If he acquit not God from the charge of dealing hardly with him he  sets his mouth against the heavens  Psal lxxiii  he vents his rage in blasphemies he curses God and dies  I HAVE now traced out the natural progress of vice from its slenderest beginnings to its  baneful issue In the preceding discourses I delineated the train of inward indulgences and deceits by which passion is rendered irregular and put forth into acts of sin and the manner in which from acts of sin habits of depravity spring up and grow and multiply and in the present I have described that hardness of heart and that contempt and hatred of religion which necessarily result from confirmed and multiplied habits of wickedness and complete the corruption of the sinner It is a shocking a confounding object It cannot be beheld without horror If any of you shudder at it be careful to turn your terror to your own advantage It inculcates the most important lessons in the most alarming manner especially when it is considered in connexion with the several gradations which from the first deviation into vice almost imperceptibly lead forward to it  THE whole of this subject serves as an awful warning to those who are so happy as not to be yet engaged in any vicious course I cannot conclude it without again beseeching the young and the innocent to guard against the first deviation from virtue however small it may appear and however strong you may think the inducements to it Give no credit to its infant smiles admit not a wish for the pleasure  or the profit which it promises they are a lie its  end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a twoedged sword  Prov v  In vain you think of sinning in moderation of setting bounds to your transgressions of going only a certain length but no farther you might as well attempt to restrain the raging of the ocean Vice creeps on by little steps but with an uninterrupted progression By the smallest failure in care and recollection you will slide from what is lawful into what is suspicious from that into what is plainly sinful from lesser into greater transgressions from acts into customary practice from strong inclinations into deliberate habits from one habit into another from less to more inveteracy from the practice of wickedness to the love of it The connexion between the slightest vicious indulgence and the blackest guilt though formed by many links is indissoluble To what vigilance against the smallest trespass would an adequate sense of this determine us Labour to acquire and to preserve the liveliest sense of it Avoid every object which can excite the faintest inclination to a forbidden course fly from every situation which can assist its operation Give no wilful indulgence so much as to a sinful thought or an evil imagination  consent not even in your hearts to the demands of any irregular passion To restrain the extravagance of thought and to check the first rising of unlawful passion is the easiest as well as the surest means of preventing hardness of heart and future misery It will require intense and constant care but if this be neglected to repent to keep you in the state of penitence to preserve you from relapses into sin will require much more painful vigilance The strongest inclination to sin which you can feel at present bears no proportion to the violence of desire to persist and to go on in sin which will torment you if you once enter into its ways If you suffer yourselves to contract a vicious habit for conquering it you must lay yourselves under harder restraints than would now be necessary and deny yourselves many things which now you might safely use and you will be less disposed and less able to apply the remedy  Take heed  therefore brethren that ye begin not  to depart from the living God  Heb iii    BUT alas how many of us have already begun to depart from him How many of us have already departed far from him Return without delay In whatever part of your sinful  progress you may be the present is the fittest season that ever you will find for reformation If you return not you must go on if you grow not better you must grow worse there is no possiblity of your being stationary Next to escaping sin is quickly to forsake it To forsake it the most quickly is far more difficult than to have avoided it but will become every day more difficult and more precarious The diseases of the soul as well as of the body are easiest to be cured at first by continuance they become more obstinate and by long continuance a slight ailment may grow to such a head as to baffle the most powerful medicine While the sinner only slumbers a slight touch will rouse him if he falls asleep it will require a strong pull to awaken him but if he sinks into a lethargy what force is sufficient to remove it and if he is dead in sin what but a miracle can raise him to spiritual life I will say to every one of you set about your reformation immediately and God will enable you to accomplish it But I must likewise say if you delay it for one hour it may very soon be impossible If this moment you disregard the checks of conscience refuse the calls of the gospel and resist the motions of the spirit think not that you will yield to them hereafter Every time they are felt and disregarded their influence will be weakened If this day they produce a purpose to repent in a little tomorrow they  will produce a fainter design to repent at a more distant time and very soon they will produce no intention ever to repent  To day if ye will hear his voice  if ye would ever listen to it today  harden not your hearts  Heb iii  If you continue to harden them the time will come when if you should happen to be alarmed to a sense of your guilt your souls will be overwhelmed with such desponding thoughts as these my condition is desperate the labour of extirpating habits so deeply rooted would be insurmountable I have not the resolution to attempt it God has doubtless long ago withdrawn his grace else I could not have sinned so heinously he has given me up to judicial hardness it were presumption for so provoking an offender to hope for his forgiveness of the past or his assistance for the future there remaineth nothing for me but the  fearful looking for of judgment  Chap x  Then your reformation will be barely possible it would be almost miraculous▪ but what reason has the daring sinner to expect a miracle  Seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near  Isa lv    WHETHER you have avoided vicious courses or whether you have forsaken them be careful  constantly to maintain a deep abhorrence of every vice Reckon nothing trivial that is in any degree sinful When we consider how fatal the end of sin is and yet how inconsiderable its beginning and how imperceptible its advances we have reason to tremble From an unavoidable propension it proceeds first to sinful delight then to actual transgression and from acts to habits till the whole soul be corrupted and exasperated against all truth and goodness To guard ourselves against the subtlety of its insinuations and the force of its attacks we must keep its malignity and its misery continually in our view Be at pains to preserve your conscience tender and delicately sensible Whenever it warns or reproves you hearken to it Attempt not to drown its voice by the noise of mirth or to suppress it by the multiplicity of worldly cares Improve its admonitions by obedience and seek not to get rid of its rebukes except by repentance  IN so difficult a work as it plainly is to avoid the encroachments of sin let us not trust wholly to our own management To the most attentive circumspection and the most strenuous endeavours let us add dependance on the assistance of God's grace In a road so full of danger and so beset with snares  surely  it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps  Jer x  it cannot be safe to travel alone without a guide and without a helper To preserve us from the path of destruction and to uphold us in the way of life we must earnestly implore the aid of the Almighty humbly trust in it and secure its continuance by improving it  I SHALL conclude with calling your attention to the apostle's injunction  Exhort one another daily lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin  Heb iii  Christianity considers mankind as intimately related and enjoins all its followers to be concerned not for themselves only but each also for another especially in what regards their eternal interests While the hardened sinner and the scoffer is assiduous in perverting the innocent can he be a friend to virtue who will do nothing to confirm them Every man has some opportunities of checking the growth of vice in others and it is his duty to employ these opportunities and by hints and suggestions by warnings or admonitions by reproofs by every method consistent with prudence and propriety to discourage vicious practices It is a duty which elders owe especially to the  younger the parent to his children the superior to his dependents Were it conscientiously discharged it must have great effect Its being a duty implies that it is likewise the duty of each to comply with the exhortation of another in evading the cunning and resisting the power of sin It is the most important service let us all avail ourselves of it  He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding and abideth among the wise  Prov xv    SERMON IV THE DESIRE OF LONG LIFE UNREASONABLE AND PERNICIOUS  JOB vii  I would not live alway  THE desire of life is common to all animals and it is the strongest principle in every nature In other animals it is wholly instinctive in man the instinct is strengthened by sentiment and supported by reflexion In the day of high health and prosperity when our pleasures are many and our sorrows few when we indulge sanguine hopes and listen not to the suggestions of fear life seems to have charms sufficient to justify a warm attachment to it A person cut off in these circumstances is always the object of our tenderest regret When the support of a family or the establishment of friends depends on a person's life he feels himself instigated by benevolence to earnest  wishes for its long continuance The sense of guilt cloathing eternity with terrors raises the love of life to the utmost pitch of anxiety The selfcondemned grasp eagerly at another day as a respite from perdition and would gladly prolong this earthly life for ever  THE love of life continues strong even when it is opposed by sentiment and disapproved by reflexion There may be moments in the life of most men in which they imagine that it is extinguished but they are very few and in these few men only  imagine  that they have got rid of it Under the first shock or the violent pressure of a great calamity they cry out that life is not worth the living But at that very instant if they were put to the trial they would be found unwilling to resign it and no sooner is the weight of their affliction abated than they shew as strong a passion for life as before They suppose themselves indifferent about life when they are weary of its distresses The desire of life is far from being extinct even in him who can taste no satisfaction in his present condition and who regards all that is past as vanity Of the most discontented of the most disconsolate heart the first wish always is for a life of greater enjoyment and free from the wants and disappointments which  have hitherto been felt  O spare me that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no more  Psal xxxix  make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years in which we have seen evil  Psal xc  are the prayers to which nature prompts men even when they are most broken by the violence of distress or most exhausted by its continuance Averse as we are to pain we scruple not to redeem life at the expence of very grievous pain When a man has drawn life to the very dregs when old age has deprived him of every comfort loaded him with numberless infirmities and left him no possibility of better days still he is willing to live a little longer If in any case the love of this earthly life be wholly lost yet the desire of existence remains and would make the thought of annihilation horrible To seem to be reconciled to nonexistence is only a phrenzy in which the principles of nature are confounded by disease suppressed by the violence of passion smothered by depravity of heart or perverted by false opinions  RELIGION itself can seldom conquer the desire of prolonging life The man into whom it has infused the most enchanting  ideas and the liveliest hope of the celestial joys generally thinks of his dissolution notwithstanding with some reluctance He finds himself  in a strait betwixt two To depart and to be with Christ  he knows  is far better  Phil i  he desires it ardently but he cannot bring himself to be fully satisfied that the desire should be instantly accomplished a wish starts up  to abide in the flesh  Ver  for a little while and when it is repressed soon starts up again If in any the power of religion has totally subdued the love of life and eradicated every degree of aversion to death the principle is not destroyed it has but changed its form the desire of living in this state is only supplanted by the desire of living in a better state  IN my text Job disclaims every wish to lengthen out his days It was amidst the early assaults of deep complicated and seemingly irremediable distress His  flesh was clothed with worms and clods of dust  his  skin was broken and become loathsome  Job vii  he was  in misery and bitter in soul and his roarings were poured out like the waters  Chap iii  His friend instead of soothing his sorrows had raised them into agonies by cruel reproaches pronounced as  wellweighed accusations and with a provoking confidence  lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good  Job v  His expression bears plain marks of the source from which it flowed it is the language of fretfulness and impatience it betrays an excess of vehemence  I loath it I would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity  He acknowledges that he spake it  in the anguish of his spirit and complained in the bitterness of his soul  Chap vii  This was his infirmity Religion neither approves a peevish disgust at life nor requires us to extirpate all desire of it A desire which is founded in instinct and strengthened by almost all our passions which clings fast to us in every condition and assumes every form rather than quit its hold neither can nor ought to be exterminated It must be necessary it must be subservient to very important purposes Nevertheless it may become excessive and its excess may be hurtful Reason therefore and religion will concur in requiring us to govern it and they present arguments sufficient to determine us and principles sufficient to enable us to restrain it within its proper limits In order to repress the wish  for living alway  in order to excite you to conquer  an excessive fondness for long life I shall prove  FIRST That long life is in many respects undesireable and  SECONDLY That the immoderate desire of it is pernicious  FIRST That long life is in many respects  undesireable  may be evinced by arguments drawnfrom the general nature of human lifefrom the peculiar attendants of long lifeand from the superior happiness of the future life  THE general nature of human life leads us to reflexions which may reasonably check an eager passion for length of days  I would not live alway for my days are vanity  I wish not to exaggerate the evils of life it cannot serve any good purpose If the inconsiderate and gay paint its joys in too gaudy colours the peevish and dejected succeed as much in their gloomy portraits of its sorrows Complaints of the vanity and insipidity of this world have an appearance of religion but whenever they are carried beyond the truth they are offences against religion and they  injure it It is pious to extol the future world the present will not bear to be compared with it but to depreciate the present as unworthy of the God who made it cannot possibly be pious It is pious to breathe ardent desires of the glories of heaven but there is no piety in sullen contempt of those benefits which the God of heaven showers down upon the earth Heavenlymindedness is a noble temper it refines and exalts the soul but chagrin and dissatisfaction with the world is a pitiful disposition which contracts and sours the spirit and produces many vices To blacken human life is to defame its Author it obstructs resignation to his will and is incompatible with gratitude for his mercies The deficiencies of this life are numerous and great enough to intimate that man is intended for a better life but if this life were a series of unmixt distresses where would be the evidence of that divine goodness which alone can support the hope of a better The inequalities of the present state are such as require a future retribution but if it be absolute confusion without a mark of wise or righteous government it can afford no proof of that justice from which only a retribution can proceed When the Scripture asserts that life is  vanity  it means not that it is altoge  her sorrow or void of all enjoyment on the  contrary both by its precepts and by the examples of the Saints it teaches us that in every state we may  be content  Phil iv  that in the worst situation we may  be patient  Jam v  that  all the days of our appointed time  we may  wait till our change come  Job xiv  When old age with assumed authority preaches to youth that life contains nothing at all worth seeking after it only utters its own regret that life is over Undistinguishing censures of the condition of man always are either the murmurings of discontent or the unfelt language of affectation They have no sanction from genuine experience Each of you has had many griefs but each of you has likewise had many joys If a moment of deep distress obliterates the sense of former pleasures a moment of gladness banishes the remembrance of past distress If the memory of some great affliction recurs at intervals for years and occasions hours of sighing yet with these are mingled days of ease and even of cheerfulness Afflictions which we think at their first onset must put a period to our earthly comfort are so much mellowed by time as to become very tolerable and to admit the partnership of many pleasures Under the acuteness of bodily pain the pangs of disappointment  the anguish of grief the heart can find no peace but in the life of every man how small a proportion have the moments thus embittered born to his happier days It is not more certain that this world cannot satisfy all our desires than that it gratifies many of them Let us not dissemble the favours of our Maker let us not unthankfully vilify the enjoyments which he bestows let us not fretfully aggravate the evils which he has mingled in the cup of life If the heart can really go along with the overcharged descriptions of unalleviated misery in which illhumour indulges itself they will corrupt it If they can make any determinate impression it must be a bad impression In consequence of it that desire which God hath made the strongest in our nature would appear to be an absolute absurdity it would seem to be at variance with our whole condition We must fall into stupid indifference sullen disgust or dejecting tiredness of life These are dispositions which religion reprobates It acknowledges only such moderation in the love of life as the just estimate of it can authorize  WE may consider life as it really is we may even turn up its fairest side and yet find abundant reason both for checking the ardor  and for contracting the limits of our desire of lifeThis life cannot be a state of  perfect  enjoyment It is not adequate to the capacity of the soul it necessarily leaves a sense of deficience which would require something nobler to fill it up We wish to vary our enjoyments but the number of them is limited and their frequent recurrence begets satiety Most of them grow first insipid and then distasteful What gave us pleasure by its presence we often despise upon reflexion Our relish varies what at one time attached us to life a little after we count of no value It is lawful to desire life for the sake of its enjoyments but because its enjoyments are to our experience imperfect it must be unreasonable to desire it with anxiety or to wish to protract it to its extremest lengthThis life cannot be a state even of  pure  enjoyment Its sunshine is broken by many intervals of rain and tempest Uneasiness of mind pain of body and distress in outward circumstances make weeping often suddenly to follow laughter The heart sometimes feels pleasure and pain at once it regrets one want while it rejoices in the supply of another it fears one evil while it exults in having escaped another it mourns for a dead friend in the very hour in which it indulges gaietywith the living The most fortunate have  their disagreeable moments and multitudes are visited with afflictions severe frequent and lasting The soul pants for unmingled joy but this world affords it not and can it be reasonable to exceed in fondness for a state in which disappointment is inevitable Were you permitted to live your past life over again each of you would wish for an exception of some particulars and if you should live twenty years longer you would as little be content to tread again the same unvaried steps Imagination paints flattering prospects of the future which inflame the desire of living on but if they were examined by the standard of the past they would lose a great part of their powerNothing on account of which you can be anxious to live is  certain  You wish to accomplish a favourite design but you may live and yet not accomplish it and you may accomplish it and find little joy in it You wish to make provision for your family but are you certain that by living you shall make it or are you certain that an ampler provision will be a real advantage to them You wish before you die to see your children grown up and flourishing and repaying all your cares alas the tenderest cares of parents have sometimes been repaid only with anguish happy would they have thought it that they had been dead before  they felt it Every hope that can enamour you of life is precarious can it then justify very earnest wishes to prolong your days By the unalterable decree of Heaven life is short the utmost remainder therefore of your life cannot deserve great solicitude and when it has so large a mixture of vanity need we repine at the decree Would it really be desireable to have lived before the flood  THE happiest among mankind will not say that this representation of the vanity of human life is beyond the truth Yet it is sufficient to convince us that an eager desire of spinning out life would be extravagant in comparison of its value This representation will not suggest an attempt to extirpate the desire of life but it will enforce the necessity of moderating it It will dispose us neither to be impatient for the hour of our departure nor to repine because we must soon depart Content to live as long as God pleases we shall willingly obey his call to resign our breath Thankful for life while it continues we shall feel the approaches of death without dejection The measure of our days we shall without carefulness refer to the will of God  The peculiar attendants of long life may reasonably check the anxious desire of it Of  the wish for length of days which swells into fervour in the breast of the young and the prosperous it is always tacitly a part to continue in health at ease full of spirits possessed of a quick relish for enjoyment This implication renders the wish chimerical It is not such an old age that is allotted to human creatures Youth necessarily fades like the flower of the field years give every thing a very different aspect Old age is the dregs of a turbid cup If you live long you can expect only such a life as falls to the share of man If that be not highly eligible you cannot reasonably be anxious for it  EVEN this darkest period of life is sometimes relieved by streaks of shining light Now and then you meet an aged person who retains considerable health and vigour and a capacity for many satisfactions You see one whose weakness if it has rendered his enjoyments languid has likewise rendered his pains gentle You find one whom a happy temperature has preserved fit for receiving and communicating pleasure in the cheerful intercourse of society You find one whom the wisdom of religion has rendered singularly instructive and the benignity of its spirit eminently engaging You find one who  looking back is conscious of a wellspent life and looking forward espies a crown of glory prepared for him who in the thought that his labours are nearly past and his reward at hand tastes more solid and sublime delight than in all the pleasures of youth who even rejoices in his infirmities as the indications of his having reached the gates of immortality But it is only one from among many aged persons that falls under any of these descriptions What may be justly called  a good old age  Gen xxv  is generally good only in comparison with the old age of other men compared with the earlier periods of life its days are almost always  the evil days  Eccl xii    I WILL not represent old age in its most frightful forms I will not paint the condition of that wretch who has wasted his life in empty joys who cannot longer taste even these who feels that he shall be  soon cut off and fly away  Psal xc  and who hath not a hope beyond the grave I will not remind you of the monster who continues to hold fast the sins of his youth who is racked by desires which indulgence has rendered importunate but which decay has disqualified him for gratifying who sunk into decrepitude glories in  the former abuses of his strength and delights in recounting the sins which long ago should have covered him with shame and produced bitter repentance I will not describe the man whose avarice grows as the time in which he can enjoy his riches becomes less I will not even enlarge on the peevishness the fretfulness the suspiciousness the censoriousness the severity which often come on with years which chace away the young from the society of the aged and render the attentions of their very children an irksome task All these are the  vices  of old age and if you be solicitous to live long you should be equally solicitous to be virtuous were it only that by vice you latter days may not become in any of these ways contemptible and wretched  BUT you must expect that your old age will be just like that of most other men comfortless in many respects Old age cannot but have fewer enjoyments and more pains than the prime of life It has rendered the organs callous to the impressions of pleasure and by frequent repetitions these impressions have become faint That exertion which was a high gratification in the maturity of life will be an overpowering burden in its decline The old have lost their relish for their accustomed  pleasures and there are not other pleasures to supply their place To every pleasure of the young the quickness of desire and the presumption of hope give a seasoning which the old man cannot procure he has come to the years when  desire shall fail  and he  shall say I have no pleasure in them  Eccl xii  The certainty of his dying soon throws a gloom upon all his satisfactions He has outlived the companions of his former days and he is incapable of forming new connexions with equal closeness He goes into the streets into the chief places of concourse and he finds none that remembers his father he speaks of the friends of his own youth and even they are forgotten he meets but a few who recollect that they have heard their names when themselves were very young He is left himself  alone and there is not a second  Chap iv  the uneasy thought that he shall very soon be as much forgotten as if he had never been is every moment forced upon him  Children's children are the crown of old men  Prov xvii  sometimes they rejoice in seeing themselves renewed in a multitude of promising descendants But it is not always so sometimes the wickedness or the misfortunes of a family  bring down the grey hairs  of the parent  with sorrow to the grave  Gen xlii  and sometimes his progeny live not to become his posterity after having followed all his children to the tomb and spent many of his years in mourning for his friends he leaves none to mourn for himself a stranger closes his eyes and aliens devour his substance  Threescore and ten or fourscore years  may leave vigour enough to protract existence but rarely enough to render it comfortable  their strength is labour and sorrow  Psal xc  If a puny constitution happen to creep forward to age it then sinks into helpless debility and the robust who scarcely knew an ailment for sixty years derive no other consequence from the remains of their vigour but greater violence of pain The disappointments and sufferings of the earlier periods are often relieved by the occupations of active and social life or alleviated by the expectation of better days but the old man is capable of no employment which can divert the full sense of his infirmities and distresses they cannot cease they must grow death is their only possible termination A fondness for life retained in old age is acknowledged to be a desire which has survived its object it cannot then be reasonable to wish eagerly for long life which must bring on old  age If we reach it we shall find all the power of patience and pious resignation necessary for rendering it supportable Its circumstances of peculiar vanity render it really desireable to be  taken away from the evil to come  Isa lvii    BUT when to the imperfection of the present life and the multiplied sorrows of long life we oppose that happiness which is to be obtained after death who can be so foolish as to form a wish for length of days Though life contains so much vanity and the prolongation of it so much increases vanity that it cannot be worthy of great solicitude yet without any hope of another life the horror of falling into nothing might make us desirous of living on But we know that we are made for another state in which God will bestow unspeakable happiness on all who fear and serve him Can it be but unreasonable to prefer continuing on earth to an entrance into heaven  ON earth we are of the kindred of the brutes but in heaven we shall be  equal unto the angels  Luke xx  and like unto God Many of the enjoyments of this world are trifling  but all the enjoyments of heaven are sublime Every present enjoyment is incomplete and leaves some sense of want but the pleasures of heaven are  fulness of joy  Psal xvi  they satisfy all the capacities of our natures In this checquered state sorrows are intermingled with all our joys but in heaven  there shall be no more sorrow nor crying nor pain  Rev xxi  All the pleasures of mortality are vitiated by the certainty that they cannot last a moment of the gayest festivity is often saddened by imagination representing distemper ready to lay it waste or death hastening to extinguish it but in heaven the delights of every moment unspeakable in themselves shall be heightened by the assurance that they will endure for ever and increase for ever  HOPE of the blessedness of heaven is the chief joy of the good man but during this life it can be only hope and is it reasonable to wish earnestly that by the prolongation of this life it may be retarded from ripening into fruition Is it not desireable that our perfect happiness begin as soon as possible Can it be wise to shew anxiety for postponing it Does the exile ever wish that  it may be long before he be permitted to return to his native land Our native land is heaven on earth we are but pilgrims and sojourners Does the fettered prisoner wish that he be not soon released In these earthly bodies we are prisoners it is only when we have cast them off that we  shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God  Rom viii  Does the heir of an ample fortune look forward with reluctance or terror to the day which shall put him in full possession of it And shall we who are heirs of the heavenly inheritance wish to defer as long as possible our entrance on it The strongest instinct would seem too weak to prevent our becoming impatient for the accomplishment of so blessed a hope But alas we are not careful to live in such a manner as may render it certain that heaven will be our portion after death and therefore we cling to life with all its miseries through dread of exchanging it for the incomparably greater miseries of eternity But if we are obnoxious to these the longest life would be a reprieve too insignificant to deserve a wish Our only security is in immediate reformation At present the thought that you may live to reform gives you some ease in the sense of  your being unprepared for eternity but the hour will come when you can live no longer how dreadful will it be to know that you are unprepared then It is not the utmost prolongation of life that can prevent it If you delay your preparation now you will still delay it the propensity to procrastination always grows with years By immediate repentance by stedfast holiness  assure your hearts  John iii  that you may be able to moderate your love of this life by the hope of a better life Then you will neither murmur at the vanity of life nor doat upon it as if it were not vanity Because a due improvement of it qualifies you for heaven you will without foolishly overvaluing it submit cheerfully to whatever it contains You will look forward to the day of death with patient expectation yet also with longing desire Once  confident  we shall be  willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord  Cor v    THUS the nature of the present life the ordinary attendants of long life and the happiness of the future life form together a strong argument for moderating our desire of length of days for they concur in forcing us  to feel that consider it in what light we will it is not worthy of vehement desire  SECONDLY The desire of long life when suffered to become immoderate is  pernicious  as well as unreasonable it is a source of painit leads us to delay our preparation for eternityand it renders our preparation more difficult  THE desire of life allowed to become immoderate is a source of pain and disquiet Every exorbitant desire creates uneasiness and anxiety but the exorbitant desire of life is of all the most tormenting Life is a complex object including all the particular goods on which other desires are fixt the desire of it agitates the soul with violence proportioned to its moment The disappointment of other desires is but the loss of some one thing the disappointment of this desire is the loss of our all in the present world The loss of one enjoyment is alleviated by the hope or the possession of others but the apprehension of losing life admits no alleviation it is the apprehension of being deprived of all sublunary enjoyments at once All earthly things are precarious the desires of them must be embittered by frequent fears but of all things life is the most precarious every day alarms  us with examples of its uncertainty if we indulge excessive fondness for it we must  through fear of death be all our lifetime subject to bondage  Heb ii  Other desires may be gratified the desire of life is singular in this that it cannot possibly be gratified its object is the future it is to live still longer if we should live a hundred years at last it must be frustrated Why should we indulge a desire fitted so much beyond all others for involving us in uneasiness subjecting us to fears and plunging us into inevitable disappointment If you have indulged it yourselves know what disquiet it creates A thought of the shortness and uncertainty of human life is harassing to you The death of a contemporary plants a dagger in your heart A situation of hazard confounds all the powers of your nature and wrings you with anguish The slightest ailment your timidity magnifies into a threatening distemper you feel the remotest beginnings of sickness with trepidation lest it should prove mortal Rid yourselves of these unavailing torments Conquer your fond solicitude for life Then shall you fully relish it while it is continued without abatement from the dread of dissolution Then shall you bear the sense of its brevity without disturbing your serenity  Knowing that you may die tomorrow you shall nevertheless enjoy this day Neither wishing for long life nor reckoning on it you shall be exempt from the possibility of disappointment You shall rejoice in every day as a new gift from God and if your days are multiplied you shall have the pleasure of living beyond your wish or expectation  THE immoderate desire of life not only eats out our present comfort but occasions the delay of that preparation for eternity on which our future happiness depends That we may prepare ourselves for eternity it is necessary that we think of it But attachment to life renders the thought of leaving life a torment and disposes us to banish it as often as it is suggested We flee to dissipation or to business we become continually more averse to preparation for our great change We easily believe what we ardently desire our fondness for long life begets the expectation of it We promise ourselves the greatest length of days that man can reach When we have approached to it we seem to be persuaded that we shall overleap the utmost limits of the  time appointed to man upon earth  Job vii    We flatter ourselves that full space remains for the necessary preparation we therefore still go on to neglect it for the present death arrests us before we have set about it and conveys us into the mansions of woe But by moderating our love of life we shall be able to bear the thought of dying many occasions will suggest it and we shall willingly embrace them That thought often present will instigate us to make immediate preparation We shall live always so as to be always fit to die  THE immoderate love of life renders our preparation for death more difficult Attachment to life and attachment to the good things of life mutually support and strengthen one another Ambition avarice sensuality inflame the love of life for without our living they cannot be gratified They are in their turn inflamed by it The more anxious we are for life the higher value we must set upon those things which render it agreeable But the mortification of fleshly and worldly lusts is a great part of our preparation for death How can that man be fit to leave this world for ever who doats upon those things which he must for ever leave along with it Such lusts are not only vicious but likewise the great sources of all other  vices they cherish the habit they impel to the practice they impede the relinquishment of all that wickedness which renders us in every respect unprepared for the state of retribution incapable of the favour of God unfit for the enjoyment of him meet only for the day of vengeance Like noxious weeds they cumber the soul choak the seeds of goodness and prevent its growth and they entangle us in pursuits inconsistent with that diligence in welldoing which alone can form us to virtue and qualify us for eternal happiness But if the man who fondly hugs the present life be called to hazard it in holding fast his integrity how difficult must he find it to obey the call Unable to reconcile himself to the thought of resigning this life he is in the extremest danger of forfeiting all the interests of the next by a timid apostacy from virtue It is madness by fostering an immoderate desire so much to increase the difficulty of what is in itself difficult enough the attainment of purity and holiness sufficient to accomplish us for the everlasting presence of the allperfect God Where the love of life is moderate the love of the world can scarcely become extravagant in proportion as that is conquered earthly affections will of course decline our temptations will become fewer and less powerful our reformation our improvement  and our progress will be facilitated and accelerated  THESE considerations I have suggested in order to excite you to moderate the desire of prolonging life I have proved that long life is in many respects undesireable The vanity of life the increase of vanity in its later periods and the excellence of that state from which the protraction of it detains us at once evince that excessive fondness for it is unreasonable and impress sentiments fit for checking and correcting it They are arguments for our setting ourselves to subdue it and they are the direct means by which it may be subduedI have likewise proved that the excessive desire of life produces the most pernicious consequences These both excite and direct our efforts to subdue it they not only urge us to restrain it but at the same time indicate the excesses from which it needs to be restrained It is not to be extirpated but it must be rendered consistent with composure and serenity in a full view of the shortness and precariousness of this mortal state consistent with our willingly dwelling on the consideration of our latter end and our applying ourselves readily to make preparation for it and consistent with that disengagedness from the things of time that purity from  worldly lusts and that constancy in holy practice which are requisite for our being capable of happiness after deathI plead not for a stupid indifference to life a sullen disdain of it or a peevish impatience for death to these religion gives no countenance I plead only for such moderation in the love of it as suits its real value as fits the desire of life for answering its end as prevents the abuse of this passion from defeating or even reversing the benefits of which it was intended to be productive and in strongly inculcating this reason and religion conspire But that we may be able to listen to them we must without delay  fly for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us  Heb vi  we must by an effectual reformation and by unwearied diligence and constant improvement in all goodness  make our calling and election sure  Pet i  Though an ardent passion for the present life can never be but unreasonable and hurtful yet it can never become reasonable and is scarcely possible for the wicked man to avoid it Destitute of all good hope beyond the grave terrified with dismal forebodings of wretchedness he loves life far beyond his own opinion of its value he clings to it even while he nauseates it he pants for it while he knows  not how to bear it In this as well as in every other respect wickedness intangles men in palpable absurdity and ensnares them in acknowledged inconsistence Speedily therefore abandon wickedness for till you have abandoned it all your sentiments and conduct must be contradiction and perplexity to think or to act rationally properly or wisely will not be in your power  SERMON V THE NATURE OF SOUND DOCTRINE  TITUS ii  But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  SOUND doctrine is an expression so commonly used by Christians that few are apt to suspect any ambiguity in its meaning Every one of those sects into which the Christian world is unhappily divided applies the expression to signify the whole of its own system of doctrine but especially those speculative and disputable tenets which distinguish it from other sects and even those technical terms which it has coined or adopted on purpose to define them with precision All sects with equal confidence appropriate the epithet to their own peculiar systems yet the distinguishing tenets of different sects  are contradictory▪ It is certain therefore that the epithet is misapplied by some of them Each affirms that it is misapplied by all except its own adherents and as the theological system of every sect contains something of human and consequently fallible explication impartiality can scarce avoid suspecting that the epithet is in some measure misapplied by all sects It will not therefore be superfluous professedly to ascertain and illustrate its genuine import  WITH this view I shall FIRST examine its precise meaning in Scripture  SECONDLY Explain the several particulars which shall from that examination appear to be implied in it and  THIRDLY Conclude with some reflexions naturally suggested by the subject  SOUND  doctrine sound or wholesome words sound speech sound in the faith  are all expressions found in Scripture and evidently intended to convey the same idea The original words which express the epithet in all these phrases  In one text the adjective  in another the verb  in all the rest the participle    refer primarily to bodily health  as opposed to disease but they are by classical writers used with great latitude for signifying metaphorically whatever is right or approveable They are all words of the same etymology One of them  ▪  primarily signifies  healthful  but is also used by Greek authors to signify  healing wholesome  or conducive to health Another of them  ▪  signifies most literally  healing  but is used likewise in several places of the new Testament  Luke v vii xv  to signify  healthful  We may conclude therefore that they are designed to be synonymous when they are applied to doctrine and to denote such as is healthful or such as is healing or such as unites both these characters What they precisely denote we shall be best able to determine by comparing the passages in which they occur and examining the scope and connexion of each All these passages lie in Paul's epistles to Timothy and to Titus and from the slightest attention to them it will I think be evident that the Apostle calls doctrine  sound  in a sense very remote from that in which the term is used by the discordant sects of Christians that he constantly means it to express both the ideas which it naturally signifies that he intends the genuine doctrine of Christ but with a particular  reference both to its being  healthful  pure and unsophisticated and to its being wholesome or  healing  as having a practical tendency So far is he from designing it to denote the peculiarities of any human system that on the contrary he is at pains to intimate that he designs it to express the plainness and simplicity of the doctrine of the gospel as delivered by Christ and his Apostles in direct opposition to the precarious opinions the subtile explications and definitions the ingenious speculations and refinements of uninspired men and so far is he from applying the term to any curious or intricate theory that he no less clearly and constantly intimates that by calling doctrine  sound  he means to express its being fit to cure the diseases and promote the health of the soul and that in opposition not only to tenets directly immoral but particularly also to the inutility and pernicious tendency of all subtile questions and abstract disquisitions These two ideas by which the Apostle characterizes  sound  doctrine it will be necessary to trace out jointly for in every passage of his writings they are jointly kept in view with the greatest care  OUR Apostle uses the term  sound  doctrine in Tim i He immediately subjoins a definition of it it is what is  according  to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which  says he  was committed to my trust  Ver  it is what is plainly and expressly revealed by God in the gospel In the context the idea of  sound  doctrine is still more precisely defined and fully illustrated particularly by being contrasted with its opposites To perceive this we must look back to the beginning of the paragraph ver The Apostle there reminds Timothy that he had formerly desired him to  charge some that they teach no  OTHER  doctrine  OTHER he can only mean than the doctrine of the gospel which he had preached And what was the other doctrine which they taught The next words inform us  Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies  Ver  the fabulous traditions which the Jews had invented and which they pretended led to the right understanding of the Scriptures and the fanciful notions concerning certain successive derivations of spiritual beings commonly called Aeons from the Supreme Being or from one another which the Apostle justly pronounces  endless  or interminable because being founded solely in imagination they might be and actually were varied and multiplied according to every man's caprice The Christian converts from Judaism retaining their fondness  for both these endeavoured to intermix them with or superadd them to the gospel under pretence of explaining some of its doctrines with the greater precision and fullnessThese speculations which were the human definitions and refinements at that time heterogeneously interwoven with the gospel he censures not only as being  another doctrine  totally foreign to the gospel but also very explicitly on account of their having no  moral tendency  but necessarily drawing men off from practice for he subjoins  which minister questions  intricate perplexing unprofitable disputes  rather than godly edifying  That it might appear how contradictory they are in this respect to the gospel he asserts that its  end  its sole purpose its direct and ultimate scope is  love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned  Ver  and so anxious is he to exclude the subtilizing upon its simple principles that he represents every such attempt as a deviation from its whole structure and design  from which  says he  some  the teachers already censured  having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling  Ver  He proceeds to expose the ignorance and selfconceit which led them into this deviation and as they vented their fantastical subtleties  as belonging to the law and under pretence of teaching it perfectly he takes occasion to explain what was the real design of the law not to serve as a foundation for such speculative visions but to condemn every kind of immorality many kinds of it he enumerates and it is inclosing the enumeration that he says  And if there be any other thing that is  CONTRARY  to sound doctrine  Ver  Thus directing us to refer the phrase to the whole paragraph and to explain it by the whole tenour of his discourse as marking the doctrine of the gospel as  simple  and as  practical  fully taught by Christ and his Apostles and applied to the sole purpose of promoting holiness uncombined with any refinements of human ingenuity which always are another doctrine and never fail to counteract its tendency to produce not purity and charity but indeterminable controversies and unhallowed uncharitable contentions and divisionsThe idea of Christian doctrine which he had here given he is solicitous to keep in view throughout the epistle and frequently recurs to it In particular when he predicts a great corruption of the Christian church and describes it as a  departure from the faith  Chap iv  he plainly intimates that the departure consisted in a deviation from  that simplicity and moral tendency which belong to the true faith for in exhorting Timothy to oppose it by  good doctrine  Ver  he gives him this direction  Refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself unto godliness  Ver    BUT chap vi he speaks again of  wholesome  or  sound words  for in the original the epithet is the same which he had formerly applied to doctrine What these were he immediately explains  Even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ  the gospel in the simplicity in which it was at first delivered and  the doctrine which is according to godliness  thus studiously unfolding and forcing into view both the ideas which we have affirmed to be implied in the epithet If farther evidence of this be necessary the whole context will abundantly supply it He insinuates that some  consent not to the wholesome words  but  teach otherwise  Otherwise than what Certainly one of two things Either  first  otherwise than he had taught and commanded Timothy to  teach and exhort  immediately before and then he must mean that they teach otherwise than they ought and not according to the  wholesome words of Christ  who are not careful to inculcate the several moral duties of life for he  had immediately before been wholly occupied in giving plain practical directions concerning the particular duties incumbent on Timothy himself on widows and on servants Or  secondly  otherwise than was required by the general descriptions which the Apostle had formerly given of Christian doctrine and that these had been anxiously contrived to mark especially both its practical tendency and its simplicity in opposition to all human speculations and opinions is evident from the passage which we have already explained and might be confirmed by other passages The apostle's idea of  sound words  is farther ascertained by the character which he gives of the man who deviates from them  Ver    He is proud knowing nothing but doating  ailing diseased  about questions and strifes of words  It is a false conceit of his own acuteness and ingenuity which impels him to subtilize on the plain doctrines of the gospel and his doing so betrays his total ignorance of their genuine nature and is truly a distempered appetite for enquiries discussions and definitions which profound or important as he imagines them are in fact trifling or unintelligible logomachies at the best controversies not about truth itself but about particular modes of expressing it  none of them necessary and perhaps all of them in some respect improper He stigmatizes these as not only thus foreign to the simplicity of the gospel but also contradictory to its moral tendency as speculations  whereof  instead of  godliness cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth  In this passage therefore as well as in the former it is the original simple doctrine of the gospel studiously opposed to all abstract curious definitions and questions misnamed theological that the Apostle calls  sound  or  wholesome  and he so calls it with a direct and particular view to mark its natural influence on all the virtues of a good life It will not perhaps be a blameable minuteness to remark farther that in this passage it is the WORDS of Christ not his DOCTRINE as in the former passage that the Apostle calls  sound  on purpose it would seem to intimate that the words of Scripture are the most proper for expressing the doctrine of Scripture that the substitution of other terms as more explicit and precise and fitter for distinguishing the truth from error is really a deviation from the simplicity of the gospel and a certain means of introducing human refinements and raising vain and subtile questions heterogeneous to its nature and design At any rate the Apostle's anxiety to condemn  these is plain and undeniable for returning to this subject he concludes the epistle with an earnest exhortation to beware of them  O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith  Ver    NOTWITHSTANDING all the pains which the Apostle had thus taken to describe and recommend sound doctrine the false teachers persisted in their attachment to fanciful and unprofitable fables and questions and disseminated them in the Ephesian and other Asiatic churches with so great success that he found it necessary to resume the subject in his second epistle to Timothy and to give almost the whole epistle a reference to it He commands Timothy  Tim i  to  hold fast  to adhere to  the form  the model and exemplar  of sound words  It is the same phrase which he had used in the passage last explained and he uses it in the very same sense That he means the simple doctrine of the gospel as originally delivered he is careful to intimate by immediately subjoining this test and criterion  which thou hast heard of me  not the words or the opinions of any uninspired man but the words and the  doctrine of the inspired Apostle He is very solicitous to inculcate this for he soon after exhorts him  The things which thou hast heard of me the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also  Chap ii  he tells him  Thou hast fully known  MY DOCTRINE  Chap iii  he enjoins him  Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing  OF WHOM  thou hast learned them  Ver  and he refers him to  the Scripture given by inspiration of God  as the only source from which the pure principles of religion can be derived and declares it to be  profitable for doctrine  and  able to make wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus  Ver  That it was his purpose studiously to distinguish this pure simple doctrine of the gospel from and to contrast it with the curious speculations which affected ingenuity might build upon it the abstract definitions and distinctions by which men might attempt explaining it with precision the nice and puzzling questions concerning it which they might agitate and likewise all the unscriptural technical and philosophical terms which they might invent or adopt under colour of expressing the exact truth and effectually excluding the contrary error is clear  from the whole series of his discourse When he desires Timothy  to put them in remembrance of the things  which he had said he adds  charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words  Chap ii  about contending modes of expression When he directs him  rightly to divide the word of truth  he immediately subjoins  but shun  as absolutely inconsistent with this  profane and vain  empty  babblings  Ver ▪  he could not have used an expression more significant at once of abhorrence and contempt Intent on stigmatizing them he again reprobates them in terms of detestation  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid  Ver  unlearned in truth they always are however much they may assume the guise of learning or of penetrationIt is no less evident that the Apostle in this place calls words  sound  with an express design to mark their wholesome or practical tendency he even labours to force this into view and to keep it in view He declares that this is an essential part of his idea of  the form of sound words  he carefully includes it in his very description of them he says they are the words  which are in faith and  LOVE  which is in Christ Jesus  Chap i  Whenever he mentions the refinements and subtleties which he so anxiously  excludes from sound doctrine he never fails carefully to specify their having no moral or their having an immoral tendency They are not only  to no profit  but to great hurt  to the subverting of the hearers  Chap ii  They are so far from producing love that they  gender strifes  Ver  They not only do not promote godliness but in proportion as they are indulged  they will increase unto more ungodliness and will eat as doth a canker  Ver  In the progress of his discourse he again predicts that apostasy which he had foretold in his first epistle and described as a  departure from the faith  and here he describes it as a contradiction to the  practical  tendency of  sound  doctrine he marks it by the corruption of morals consequent on that apostasy and after enumerating several vices which were to abound in these  perilous times  Chap iii  he sums up the character of them in this  Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof  Ver  Farther when he recommends the Scripture as the only untainted source of Christian doctrine he takes particular care to remark that it  is profitable for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works  Ver    IMMEDIATELY after this he gives Timothy a very solemn charge to indefatigable diligence in  preaching  and applying the  word  Chap iv  in enforcing which he employs the phrase  sound doctrine For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine  Ver  and he employs it in the very same sense as formerly He characterizes it by its simplicity in opposition to all human refinements and determinations it is  the word  Ver  it is  the truth  unmixt with any  fables  Ver  with any of the precarious of false opinions the doubtful speculations the disputable niceties which he foresaw would arise in the Christian church and usurp the name of sound doctrine He characterizes it by its moral tendency it is fit to be applied to  reprove  and  rebuke  sin and  exhort  ‡ to holiness purposes to which practical doctrine alone is applicable He characterizes it by both these qualities in his description of the persons who  will not endure it  § their aversion to it is owing to  their own lusts  to a vitiated taste loathing the plain truths of the gospel peculiar prejudices producing delight in empty subtleties or corrupt passions disgusting them against the holy doctrine of the gospel and attaching them to frigid abstract notions which touch  not the heart and to loose opinions which give countenance or licence to their favourite vices Prompted by such lusts  they heap to themselves teachers  such as gratify their illdirected curiosity or their prejudices by dwelling on the distinctive subtleties of some human system such as by amusing them with these divert their attention from good practices such as propagate principles consistent with an immoral life  having itching ears  taking pleasure in hearing only what tickles them by falling in with their distempered notions or their corrupt inclinations  IN writing to Titus as well as to Timothy the apostle several times applies the epithet  sound  to doctrine to speech or to faith and he applies it invariably in the same sense Among the necessary qualifications and the indispensible duties of a Christian bishop he specifies this  Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by  SOUND DOCTRINE  both to exhort and convince the gainsayers  Tit i  This sound doctrine is the simple doctrine of revelation as proposed in revelation unadulterated with any thing of human invention he expressly says so it is  the faithful  the sure the indubitable  word as he hath been taught  It is doctrine of a practical nature for by it he might  be able to exhort  That he was desirous of expressing both these characteristics of it and that particularly in opposition to all unscriptural and unprofitable speculations is evident from his description  Ver  of the  gainsayers  whom Christian teachers were  to convince  BY this sound doctrine that is by shewing that their refinements had no foundation in it not by setting up other human explications in opposition to theirs They were  vain talkers  venting frivolous notions under the specious boasting shew of wisdom and philosophy of depth or of precision and by this means  deceivers teaching things which they ought not  Their opinions were immoral they were  unruly  they  subverted whole houses  they flattered the corrupt propensities of the Cretans who had been justly characterized  always liars evil beasts slow bellies  On account of both these depravities of their doctrine the Apostle commands Titus to  rebuke them sharply  to expose the futility and immorality of their notions  that  says he  they may be sound in the faith  Ver  that they may return to the simple and practical  doctrine of the gospel which is the sole object of faith To keep in view by what means they had departed from this he adds  Not giving heed to Jewish fables  what these were we have already seen  and commandments of men  definitions determinations and impositions of human invention by which they  turn from the truth  Ver  or pervert it and by perverting it by deviating from its simplicity they deviate likewise from that holiness which is its end  they profess that they know God  often that they know him more perfectly and understand his will more accurately than others  but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate  Ver  It is in direct opposition to these false teachers that the Apostle immediately subjoins in the text  But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  and what he here principally meant by it he professedly and largely explains in the following verses  That the aged men be sober  and so n  Chap ii  it is the inculcating of the plain moral duties of life in every condition When among the duties of aged men he mentions  sound in faith  Ver  and among those of Titus  sound speech  Ver  there can be no doubt that he uses the expression  in his ordinary and invariable meaning and in the latter case he explains it by  gravity  weight or importance and by  uncorruptness  Ver  freedom from all taint of a foreign mixture and he says that it  cannot be condemned  being the simple doctrine of the gospel not one human explication opposed to another it cannot be retorted by the adversary so  that he that is of the contrary part  must  be ashamed  Ver  confounded and silnced There cannot be a clearer or a stronger proof how essential a moral tendency is in the apostle's idea of sound doctrine or how great a part of sound doctrine he reckons morality to be than this his professed explication of that idea It is remarkable that for nine verses after his exhortation to teach sound doctrine he does not so much as mention even any of the genuine and simple articles of Christian faith and when at length he comes to mention some of them it is not curiously to explain or define them but solely to represent them as powerful principles of good practice When he mentions  the grace of God  its having  appeared to men  its  bringing salvation  he considers it simply as  teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly rightcously and godly in this present world  Ver  When he mentions  the blessed hope and the appearing of Christ  to judgment it is only as the  looking for  these will strongly encourage and urge us to those great duties of life  Ver  When he mentions Christ's  giving himself to death for us  it is only to inculcate its practical end and influence  that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works  Ver  In commanding therefore to  speak the things which become sound doctrine  the Apostle most manifestly and explicitly means to command to inculcate both holiness in general and all the particular duties of morality and to be solicitous not to subtilize upon the doctrines of the gospel or to define them with exact precision but neglecting all human definitions of them to urge them warmly as motives to the several virtues of the Christian life So anxious is he that Titus and all his successors should teach according to this model that he adds this charge  These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all autbority  Ver  He is so full of the subject that he returns to it and after recommending some other moral duties  Chap iii  and enforcing them by a simple view of the peculiar doctrines of the gospel  Ver  enjoins Titus to  affirm constantly that they  which have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works but to avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain  Ver  The man who addicts himself to these and propagates them it is that he calls  a heretic  Ver  as by restricting and refining upon the simple truths of the gospel he gives occasion to divisions and parties in the church  THUS by an impartial examination of all the texts in which it is mentioned we have ascertained the true scriptural sense of  sound doctrine  The Apostle uses the term so often and whenever he uses it unfolds and guards its meaning so carefully that he has enabled us to ascertain it with the fullest and the most convincing evidence The evidence is indeed so strong that when we attend to it so large an investigation may seem to be unnecessary but men are so enured to an opposite conception of the subject that the largest investigation will I am afraid be insufficient for striking conviction into the rigid adherents to sects and parties and will be far from rendering it superfluous as we proposed in the SECOND place to illustrate the several particulars which we have found to be implied in it  IN general  sound doctrine  is the pure  genuine doctrine of the gospel  the very doctrine taught by Christ and his Apostles entire without the omission of any part of it unperverted without being strained or wrested sincere unmixt with any thing else either in the matter or in the manner of expression proposed chiefly in the  sound words  in which Christ and his Apostles delivered it Certainly it can require but little modesty to own that these are the fittest the words of Christ are the words of God they were dictated by his divine nature the spirit of God superintended the Apostles and Prophets so as to restrain them from using any words which were not significant of the very truth and notwithstanding considerable varieties in their stile the language of them all has a certain common character and general complexion in respect of which we may affirm that there is one uniform tenour of scriptural phraseology This general description of sound doctrine will be in the main admitted by all sects for though their peculiar systems be in some parts diametrically opposite each sect reckons its own system the pure doctrine of the gospel and though they all employ some technical terms not found in Scripture each reckons its own set of these perfectly equivalent to the terms of Scripture but more definite  fit for expressing their real sense so determinately as to guard them against misconception or misinterpretation  IT therefore deserves our most serious attention That  sound doctrine  means the pure doctrine of the gospel  particularly as distinguished from all human definitions limitations refinements and superadditions  We have all along seen how explicitly and how anxiously the Apostle sets it in opposition to all these His expressions are levelled directly against the corruptions of doctrine which prevailed at that time but they are so chosen as to be likewise in strict propriety applicable to all posterior corruptions of it he foresaw these and foretold them and has an eye to them at least in some of the passages which we have examined Indeed all the curious or forced explications of Christian doctrine all the groundless or precarious deductions from it all the subtile controversies about it which have infested the church demonstrate themselves to be such adulterations as he condemns they are marked by the very features which he has delineated they have produced the very effects which he has described  THEY had already begun and they quickly spread wider and wider Forgetful  that the gospel was not given to exercise ingenuity or gratify curiosity and desirous of recommending it to unbelievers particularly the philosophers partly too it must be owned swayed by their own preconceived notions and expecting to display the accuracy of their own apprehension some Christians began very early to conceive the articles of their faith according to the theories of the Greek philosophy chiefly the Platonic to define them with scientifical precision and in the phraseology of the schools and to adopt similitudes for illustrating them and hypotheses for accounting for them not only arbitrary but generally improper They were accused of error Their accusers were not wise enough to satisfy themselves with proving that the Scripture did not imply or admit the sense to which they determined it but infected with the spirit of the same philosophy run into opposite definitions comparisons hypotheses and terms of science often equally improper and equally involving error These were justly retorted upon them by their adversaries Controversies were agitated concerning these contradictory definitions multitudes ranged themselves on each side they broke out into contention animosities unjust suspicions and insinuations mutual reproaches and invectives Falsehood was  eagerly sought for and for the most part easily found in the abstract subtile definitions of each party In the progress of disputation▪ new terms new distinctions new comparisons were invented on each side for marking with precision the peculiarity of its own opinion and new hypotheses were contrived for reconciling it to Scripture or to itself and for evading the objections urged against it Every such attempt produced new questions and every new question became more frivolous more notional more abstruse than the former In discussing it new refinements of distinction and new intricacies of argumentation were introduced Every disputant added something according to his own manner of apprehension  THE church was distracted bewildered and inflamed Councils were assembled to determine the points in question and to extinguish the heats which they had raised But instead of  holding fast the form of sound words  instead of recalling all parties to the simple doctrine of the gospel and rejecting the unscriptural precarious explications by which both sides went beyond it they entered into all the minutiae of the controversy they debated them with prejudice and passion they indulged cavil and chicane they broke forth  into clamour and outrage into mutual accusations and threatenings and sometimes they proceeded to tumult and violence The stronger party overpowered the weaker by their superior vehemence by the terror of their menaces by mere force or by a plurality it may be a very small plurality of voices They approved all the subtleties refinements and inventions of one party adopted whatever hard words and technical terms they thought fittest for discriminating them from those of the other party and by a decree of usurped but formidable authority they determined all these to be articles of faith and their chosen terms of art to be the test of the truth All who refused submission to their impositions they condemned as adherents to the contrary party and stigmatized as heretics and they reviled anathematized excommunicated and whenever they could get the civil power to enter into their resentments persecuted banished or put them to death Other councils were assembled and often gave opposite decisions established the contrary tenets and fenced them by contrary terms of art but still decided in the same spirit of party contention and violence None of their decrees ever ended a single controversy On the contrary they perpetuated the controversies then subsisting increased the bitterness  of contention and diffused it wider They never failed likewise to produce new controversies The persons who opp  d them contrived new terms distinctions and cavils in contradiction to the subtleties imp  d in their decrees they differed about th  and split into lesser parties Those who adhered to the decrees disagreed about their meaning broke out into fierce contention charged each other with error or with blasphemy and disdained communion with one another By the rage of controversy and the spirit of faction in all the Christian church was divided and subdivided and again and again subdivided into fects innumerable hating and execrating one another but distinguished only by verbal differences or by notions of none of which the Scripture affirms any thing or of which the human faculties can form no clear conception and of which any conception or thought at all is both unnecessary and unprofitable  DIFFERENT systems of philosophy were succes  vely in vogue With each of these in its turn the doctrine of the gospel was unnaturally incorporated By this means it assumed a variety of forms but all of them ve  y unlike to its original simplicity When the philosophy of Aristotle obtained unrivalled  possession of the schools a philosophy from the beginning subtile disputatious and contentious and rendered more so by the perversion of the scholastics the Christian doctrine by being adapted to it ranged according to its forced mode of distribution conceived according to its rules of definition and distinction expressed in its hard words and reasoned about in the artificial manner of its analytics was totally distorted from its genuine form A false ingenuity was laboriously employed in devising questions concerning every article of Christian doctrine in pushing them to the utmost length of subtlety and wrangling about them with all the nicety of affected precision Questions sprung from questions in an endless series all of them unnecessary most of them of no importance many of them mere plays of words many of them ridiculous many of them interminable and even unintelligible nay some of them impious and blasphemous They were almost all dogmatically determined the determinations of many of them were erected into articles of faith and the technical words employed in the determinations were the only allowed criterion of men's holding these articles  BY such  oppositions  and contentions  of science falsely so called  continued and increasing through many ages of intellectual darkness the doctrine of the papal church became a huge body of tenets unscripturally conceived and expressed and many of them not only destitute of all foundation in the gospel but directly repugnant to it The Reformers raised up in a blessed hour for that very purpose unveiled this mass of corruption exposed the perversions of the gospel which composed it and the fables which it had superadded to the gospel They pronounced the Scripture to be the only rule of faith and disclaimed all human definitions of its simple principles Happy had it been if they had persisted steddily in this But their adversaries demanded what it was precisely that they believed they declared an appeal to Scripture insufficient for fixing this because the authority of its words was pled by all sides they cried out that the doctrine of Protestants was altogether indefinite and uncertain they misrepresented it grossly they called upon them to publish it in determinate language Overcome by these importunities clamours and accusations and not perfectly cured of the subtilizing spirit from which they sprung Protestants were led unwarily though at first reluctantly to accept the challenge The earliest explications of  their doctrine were tolerably simple the scholastic mode of arrangement argument and expression was in general rather avoided than affected but the spirit of abstraction gradually acquired strength and violence the explications of doctrine given by some displeased others opposite explications were proposed questions about them were agitated they were pushed to greater and greater degrees of subtlety all the hardest words of the schools were borrowed for expressing the differences of opinion and all the most frivolous or unintelligible distinctions of the schools were employed in debating them Protestants were crumbled down into numberless sects distinguished by peculiarities of belief upon points unnecessary or impossible to be determined Creeds were opposed to creeds systems were multiplied against systems some on all sides not so much systems of Christian theology as metaphysical systems of verbal speculative abstruse unimportant controversies for which a handle was taken from that theology Each party was tenacious of its own mode of conceiving and even of expressing the truth and by this means they have all continued divided and at variance  SUCH is the general portrait of the departure of the Christians from  the  SIMPLICITY  of sound doctrine  every part of it might easily be confirmed  by numberless facts in the history of the church Not content with thus departing from it they have substituted the very deviation in its place and given it its name Every party appropriates the name of sound doctrine to those peculiar explications speculations and definitions which characterize itself and discriminate it and set it at the greatest distance from all other parties but these the Apostle expressly and in terms of abhorrence excludes from the idea of sound doctrine and urges Christians to avoid as repugnant to it What the several sects have extolled as the soundest doctrine is therefore in the Apostle's sense most unsound According to his sense of it the only sense which merits the regard of Christians the bigot of every denomination the tenacious partizan of any sect necessarily deviates in some degree and generally deviates the farthest  SOUND  doctrine  means  practical  doctrine The Apostle studiously and constantly connects this idea with the former and they are in their nature intimately connected All abstract definitions of doctrine all abstruse questions about it are in their very essence wholly speculative they are at best fit only for informing the understanding too often only for perplexing it their natural effects are thorny disputes contentions  divisions not the active exertions of Christian virtue and holiness  Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles  Mat vii  The utmost they can claim is that they may be harmlessly amusing they never can be profitable If it were possible to determine them with the greatest clearness and certainty yet they could not influence practice Abstract ideas are too frigid to warm the heart too weak to draw out good affections too dim to be kept in view in the moment of action They are always in danger of becoming hurtful the discussion of them excites passions destructive of mutual love attachment to them diverts men's attention from applying faith to practice it leads them to lay too little stress on practice and too much upon opinion Many questions have even issued in decisions on one side at least sometimes on both sides directly favourable to immorality Some of the real doctrines of the holy gospel have been so grossly misrepresented in some pretended explications of them as to be twisted into unholy principles of impurity and vice and to the real doctrines of the gospel spurious doctrines have been superadded in some systems professing to be Christian which by their necessary consequences make void all moral obligation and  this so plainly that their partizans find it necessary to disclaim consequences which they cannot refute and to throw in cautions caveats and distinctions for rendering them not conducive to but barely consistent with good practice and which will always be forgotten or disregarded in the hour of temptation Yet by the most astonishing and the profanest abuse of words tenets and explications in their tendency immoral are by those who hold them pronounced the most essential to sound doctrine the most evangelical the most honourable to the grace of the gospel But so far are they from being sound that they are in the very worst sense CONTRARY  to sound doctrine  so far from being wholesome that however fairly they be gilded over however speciously they be disguised they are poison  No opinion can be a Christian doctrine whose direct and primary tendency is not to holiness God gave a Revelation of the truth for this very purpose by it to purify and improve the hearts and to direct and influence the practice of men Every part of it is immediately and powerfully conducive to this purpose all the precepts of the gospel and all its principles conspire in promoting it The former prescribe the purest and the sublimest virtue The latter are even more directly subservient  to it they excite to that virtue They delineate those qualities characters and relations of persons and objects which are fit for producing right affections and prompting to right practice towards them but of those which though they were known could contribute nothing to this effect the Scripture takes no notice For temper and action it is not an apprehension of an object scientifically accurate that is necessary but a conception lively striking and interesting and such a conception the Scripture is careful to give of all the objects belonging to religion It sets them only in those points of view in which they can enforce piety and goodness it is intent on setting them in every attitude in which they can most strongly enforce these and it constantly and earnestly applies them to this end  THIRDLY We shall now conclude with some reflexions naturally arising from this subject  IT appears that the Christian church is more closely united in one common faith in reality than in appearance In human systems it is necessary to distinguish the principles of doctrine which they imply from the particular manner in which they explain them In the latter they differ widely and it being derived  from fallible men may very readily be improper or erroneous In the former they very generally agree and the former only is either of indubitable certainty or of real importance  LET each of us for himself study to adhere to and be satisfied with the pure simple practical doctrine of Christ despising and avoiding all unprofitable questions and speculative niceties as absolutely foreign to it It is by no means necessary for us to be wise above what is written it is improper to attempt it It is not needful to have any more precise abstract or scientifical conception of the doctrines of religion of the mysteries of the Christian faith than the Scripture gives If we find that conception inadequate we may be assured that it is not requisite perhaps not possible to render it in our present state of weakness more adequate Whatever words of human invention pretend to mark it with greater precision and force than the words of Scripture there is always reason to suspect will either distort or add something to the original doctrine of Scripture  LET us carefully attend to the great end of all Christian doctrine namely holiness of heart and life our purification from vice and our improvement in virtue Let us constantly represent  it to ourselves as expressly designed and calculated for this purpose Every opinion of immoral tendency let us abhor as perfectly incompatible with it and destructive of its very end Let us learn all the duties of life let us urge on ourselves all the truths of the gospel as motives to them let us consider them in those points of view which can render them the strongest motives Let us not rest in believing the doctrines of religion let us study them with the sole design of becoming better let us be concerned to comply with them and to act agreeably to them  let our conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ  Phil i  GOD grant that we  may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God  Col iv  and this is the will of God even our sanctification  Thess iv    SERMON VI RESIGNATION TO THE WILL OF GOD  SAM iii  It is the Lord let him do what seemeth him good  OF the pious affections there are some which though always due to God can be perfectly exercised only in the heavenly state we must be pure as God is pure and see him face to face before we can rise to that perfect love which casteth out fear or to fulness of rejoicing in the enjoyment of him as our portion There are others to which our present state gives the fullest scope and the properest exercise such is resignation to the divine Providence enabling a man sincerely to think and say amidst the most disastrous occurrences of human life  It is the Lord let him do what seemeth him good  THESE words were spoken by Eli on an occasion very likely to overcome human fortitude His sons had been guilty of gross misconduct in executing the priestly office he had  not restrained them  with sufficient authority a man of God had on this account denounced the destruction of his family  Sam ii  God had repeated and confirmed the denunciation in a vision to Samuel  I will perform against Eli all the things which I have spoken concerning his house  Chap iii  Samuel had related to him all that the Lord had said and at that instant the power of resignation enabled the too indulgent father to say  It is the Lord let him do what seemeth him good  In order to explain the temper which is here so strikingly expressed I shall  FIRST Point out the conception of God from which resignation takes its rise in creatures formed and situate as we are in the present world and  SECONDLY Illustrate the dispositions and exertions by which it is completed  FIRST I shall point out the conception of God from which resignation to his will takes  its rise Every branch of a pious temper springs from a correspondent conception of the divine character Resignation springs from a lively sense of God as the sovereign Governor of the world good wise and powerful who has placed us in a state liable to disappointment and sorrow and who by a plan of Providence too extensive to to be fully comprehended by us conducts us through this life to a higher state of being  GOD is the object of our resignation on account of his perfections not as considered simply and absolutely but as exercised in the government of the world and the disposal of our lot Were he a being however excellent who lived in selfish solitary blessedness at a distance from the earth an inactive spectator of all that passes unconcerned in what befals us we might admire and adore his perfections but we could exercise no resignation trust or confidence towards him For engaging these regards a person must have some direction and influence in our affairs Such direction vested in a fellowcreature necessarily produces dependence on him and if we know him to be welldisposed to us this dependence will be exerted in willing submission and cheerful hope God  is the supreme Ruler of the universe the original cause of all events  the most High out of  whose  mouth proceedeth evil and good  Lam iii  To second causes no event can be ultimately ascribed they derive their agency from God they are but the instruments of his will Nothing that is not either appointed or permitted by him can happen to any one of us  a sparrow shall not fall on the ground without our Father but the very hairs of our head are all numbered  Mat x  The firm belief of this leads us naturally in every event to take notice of God and to reflect that it  is the Lord who gave and the Lord who hath taken away  Job i    WHETHER he give or whether he take away his sovereignty exacts our acquiescence All things are his he has a right to dispose of them as he pleases He reigneth with unlimited authority and irresistible power To withstand his will to rebel against his appointments is to usurp his throne and to prescribe him laws The attempt is daringly presumptuous and it is desperately foolish  Wo unto him that striveth with his Maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth but shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it What makest thou  Isa xlv    Whatsoever the Lord  pleaseth that doth he in heaven and in earth in the sea and all deep places  Psal cxxxv    He giveth not account of any of his matters  Job xxxiii    Who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered Behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him What dost thou  Chap ix  Sensible of his uncontroulable dominion what can we wisely do but reconcile our minds to every situation in which he places us saying  The will of the Lord be done  Acts xxi    HIS will is always agreeable to his attributes and these invite us to refer ourselves and all our interests to him He can appoint only what is fit to be appointed what is best always seemeth best to God His character is goodness wisdom and power united Goodness is the principle of his whole administration he delights in communicating happiness to his creatures  All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth  Psal xxv  So far as we do not wilfully render ourselves incapable of them the intentions of his benevolence cannot be disappointed they are conducted by unerring wisdom They cannot be defeated almighty power secures the execution of them These attributes in perfect harmony form a  character fit to encourage our resignation and allure our confidence To a fellowcreature possessed of a very imperfect degree of this character we often commit very important affairs without scruple or suspicion To the Creator who possesses it in perfection our submission may be unreserved and implicit  They that know thy name will put their trust in thee  Psal ix  Knowing that such a God presides over the universe can we doubt that his omnipotent arm will force the most dissimilar events to cooperate for the best and wisest purposes Under his government what evil can his sincere though frail creatures reasonably dread When  he careth for you  can you hesitate to  cast all your care upon him  Pet v  Is he not O my soul thy  refuge and strength a very present help in trouble  Psal xlvi  How excellent is thy lovingkindness O God therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings  Psal xxxvi  Our experience of the past gives support and energy to our conviction of the divine character gratitude for the multitude of mercies which Providence has bestowed on each of us naturally checks complaint on account of what is disagreeable and recollection of the many instances in  which the most threatening events have turned out signally to our advantage enforces tranquillity with respect to the present and reliance with respect to the future  SOME creatures are so entirely assimilated to God so extensively acquainted with the ways of his Providence and so unalterably fixt in perfect happiness that their acquiescence in the will of the Ruler of the universe is not so properly resignation as gratitude and joy To give scope for resignation some imperfection of nature or some defect in state is requisite and both these conspire to give it exercise in human creaturesOur nature is so complicated our senses and desires are so various and often so incompatible that we cannot by any means obtain all possible gratifications at once To secure one we must submit to the want of another to enjoy pleasure we must forego profit to accumulate riches we must forfeit ease to the attainment of temporal goods we must often sacrifice the satisfactions of virtue and integrity and not to lose these we must resign many gratifications of sense appetite and passion By forming our nature in this manner God proclaims that we are not made for unallayed happiness lays us under a necessity of bearing disappointment and giving up many  things which would be desireable requires us to be content with that measure of enjoyment however incomplete of which he has made us capable and which he is pleased at any time to grant us and prepares us for eagerly embracing the excellencies of his character and government as giving ground for our referring ourselves to him without repining  OUR state in this world affords full place for resignation and demands the exercise of it We must be satisfied to want particular advantages which even inferior animals possess the strength of the lion the swiftness of the horse the flight of the eagle belong not to the condition of our being and are for ever without our reach The advantages proper to our condition are not at all times attainable and those which we have attained are not always permanent We are not placed in a region of continual serenity we dwell in the land of storms and tempests Our state is mixt complicated and precarious Because our bodies are subjected to the laws of the material world and connected with it by manifold relations our souls are necessarily affected by its vicissitudes Pain and suffering are inseparable from human life Prosperity and adversity unexpectedly succeed each other  by quick intervals In the morning we  know not what the day may bring forth  Prov xxvii  and we have neither strength nor wisdom to mould its events according to our wishes Our condition depends not wholly on our own behaviour God in token of his sovereignty and for the purposes of his government has in a great measure reserved to himself the disposal of our enjoyment and suffering and frequently dispenses them in a manner which appears to us unequal or promiscuous and of which we can give no account We feel ourselves ignorant and impotent unfit for our own direction unable to accomplish our desires While we have no dependence but on ourselves we are orphans exposed in a strange land we are travellers solitary and benighted in a waste and dreary wilderness left to wander in a thousand undistinguishable bypaths surrounded with dangers uncertain but the next step may lead us to destruction We are ready to faint under the uneasinesses and apprehensions which press upon us We cannot but wish for the friendly guidance of superior wisdom and superior power We cannot but learn with pleasure that there is a God allgood allwise and allpowerful who governs the world in whom we may  confide into whose hands we may resign all our interests with unreserved trust We naturally repose ourselves on him who carries on one fixt and wellcontrived plan amidst all the changes and commotions of things who  sitteth upon the flood  Psal xxix    who walketh upon the wings of the wind  Psal civ  who dwelleth in the tempest who from darkness produceth light and from confusion bringeth forth order A firm belief and an habitual sense of his wise and gracious though incomprehensible administration is our only adequate support  BY the appointment of God our present life is only a part of our existence an introduction to a future life subordinate to eternity In consequence of this appointment nothing in our present state is final nothing to be regarded only on its own account every thing has a reference to eternity and thence derives its real importance Prosperity and adversity pleasure and pain success and disappointment are but different means of promoting the same end but different methods of training us up for immortality It is in this light that God always considers our present life and the several events which fill it up Steady in his plan unmoved either by weak pity or by  weaker fury he goes forward in the execution of it through all the methods of severity and gentleness of chastisement and reward of restraint and encouragement allotting us such events as tend most if we duly improve them to promote our everlasting welfare In this light we likewise ought constantly to view our earthly state The view will strengthen the principles of resignation and assist its exercise We are but travellers through this world whatever affects only our outward condition whatever is merely temporal must be of little moment it is no more than the accommodation of an hour at an inn which we are soon to leave it is too inconsiderable to disturb our equanimity or check our submission to the will of God Our prospect is enlarged to eternity we look down upon this world as from the height of heaven and as the little hills in the eye of him who stands on the top of a lofty mountain sink to a level with the plain this earth seems but a point and all those earthly things which formerly looked big and excited the most anxious wishes or the most pungent regret dwindle into insignificance We are raised above some of those clouds which obscure the throne of God and give an appearance of confusion to the ways of his Providence what was irregular and inexplicable when referred only to  time becomes beautiful and consistent by being connected with eternity When we consider this life as but one period of our being one stage of our progress to perfection the most disagreeable events are often discovered to be the most useful as tending most directly to the improvement of our hearts and thus are rendered the objects of the most rational submission and the most cheerful resignation  THE connexion of this life with eternity opens likewise a new field for the exercise of our resignation and pious confidence Unable to direct our own course amidst present things which are seen we cannot but be more unable to direct it to the future world where all is unseen We have need of the guidance of him who ruleth both worlds and to his guidance a sense of our situation will make us solicitous to commit ourselves Nature feels the want but the notices which nature gives of the future world are too imperfect to support confidence in God for its felicity It is the gospel only that can support it It teaches us that God hath set on foot a stupendous dispensation of grace and love for bringing the children of men to immortal glory That sins repented of might not produce distrust he has given his Son for our  redemption from all these sins and to be  the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him  Heb v  Informed of this dispensation we can with joyful confidence resign our eternal state in welldoing to the disposal of God our Saviour It was on purpose to render our  faith and hope  in him firm and assured that he has  redeemed us by the precious blood of Christ and raised him up from the dead and given him glory  Pet i    He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things  Rom viii    SUCH are the sentiments of God's character of the nature of his Providence and of his conduct and intentions with respect to ourselves from which resignation to his will takes its rise Resignation requires some knowledge of the ways of God for supporting and encouraging it but it likewise supposes some degree of ignorance and uncertainty leaving room for implicit submission and dependence What we know of God of the general measures of his government particularly over mankind invite our acquiescence in his disposals in many cases too he has given us express promises for the accomplishment of which his fidelity is engaged by which we may safely regulate our expectations and  sustain our hopes resting so far as they extend in full assurance of the very things promised Amidst the absolute uncertainty of the particular events which shall befal us  we know that all things work together for good to them that love God  Rom viii  and all our hopes for eternity he has directed by the most explicit promises and by a clear determination of the conditions on which we may become partakers in them But we are totally ignorant of the particular steps of God's present providence of the nature of those events which await us and of  what is good for man in this life  Eccles vi  and we are ignorant of many things in the nature of our future state and that dispensation by which the everlasting happiness of the obedient is secured The whole system of Divine Providence is too large and too intricate to be fully comprehended by our weak understandings the greatest part of it is covered with thick darkness and impenetrable to mortal eyes  no man can find out the work which God worketh from the beginning to the end  Chap iii  We can only have recourse to that great Being who comprehends and orders all things to whom  all his works are known from the beginning of the world  Acts xv  following implicitly wherever he leads us resigning ourselves to his disposal through all the unknown  paths by which we must travel forward to the more unknown regions of eternity  TO explain the dispositions and exertions by which a temper of resignation is completed was the SECOND thing proposedIt consists not in a cold speculative belief that the good and wise Providence of God orders all that concerns us but in the consent of the heart that it should be so It presupposes love to God which is indeed the common foundation of all the virtues of piety and an essential ingredient in every devout affection for we can never refer ourselves to the disposal of a person whom we reckon not deserving of our love but it includes something additional to love regarding the divine goodness wisdom and omnipotence as employed in the government of the world and the management of all our interests it appropriates these perfections to ourselves and begets a sense of security in yielding ourselves up to God's disposal It includes hope in God which renders it not the forced sufferance of slaves but the willing submission of subjects But the hope is mingled with fear the sovereignty of God impresses us with awe the extent of his plan of government involves us in uncertainty what kind of events he may perceive to be best for us we feel present sorrows and have reason to believe that the general  good and our own greatest happiness will require our bearing many things which are disagreeable and our enduring severe chastisements for our iniquities A sense of this prevents our indulging the expectation of every thing that would be pleasing to us and in its place substitutes a general confidence that what impairs our satisfaction will notwithstanding contribute to our happinessResignation requires us to receive both good and evil from God but it requires us not to receive them with the very same sentiments It supposes that we are sensible of pain that we feel it with aversion and look forward to it with apprehension it consists in our nevertheless encountering and sustaining it with quietness and submission to Him who has ordained it It allows us to sorrow but not to fret it allows us to fear but not to despair it allows us to desire but not with impatience It leads us to yield to those events which we cannot avoid without any rebellious motions of heart It is a pliableness of soul by which our temper suits itself to all the vicissitudes of our state It brings our will and our desires to give place to the pleasure of God as soon as we discover what it is It teaches us to check our inclinations whenever they are inconsistent with his appointments and to controul them steadily till they concur with his  good and perfect will and suffer us to rest satisfied with all that he decrees as the best for usThat we may the more distinctly perceive the operation of a temper of resignation let us consider it as exercised with respect to the presentthe pastand the future  RESIGNATION must be exercised with respect to the present Whatever our condition at any time is we must submit to it contentedly patiently and with dutiful acquiescence in the will of God Resignation supposes not that all things should become indifferent to us this would be to divest us of the senses and affections which are essential to human nature It requires us not to be insensible either of the defects or the distresses of our lot it requires us only to bear them It is not to be measured by the acuteness of our feelings the tempers of men are necessarily very different Some have a natural coldness or hardiness of constitution which admits but a slight impression from circumstances of uneasiness but if their composure proceed not from a religious sense of the Divine Providence it is not resignation it is only a stupid unfeelingness of soul or a sullen stubbornness of disposition Others are of a soft and delicate make easily and deeply affected with whatever befals them but if they notwithstanding▪  preserve an unrepining reverence of Providence the sensibility of their hearts is so far from being inconsistent with resignation that it much enhances it they devoutly chuse that God's good pleasure be accomplished though it gives them so great pain The best of men have expressed their sense of their distresses very pathetically even while they exercised the most blameless and exemplary resignation Job welcomed the loss of all his substance and all his children with the cheerfullest submission because it was the Lord who had taken them away yet he  rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and said Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither  Job i  but  in all this  we are assured  Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly  Ver    I was dumb  says David  I opened not my mouth because thou didst it  Psal xxxix  this was the meekest resignation but it prevented not his having a pungent sense of  the reproach of the foolish the stroke of God and the blow of his hand  by which he was  consumed  Ver  Even he who is greater than man and who was perfect in resignation saying  Nevertheless not what I will but what thou wilt  felt all the bitterness of his situation and was  sore amazed and very heavy and said My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death  Mark xiv  Resignation operates not by extinguishing the sense of evil but by restraining it within proper bounds  ANY present dissatisfaction or uncasiness is apt to engross all our thoughts and to absorb our whole attention We often yield to the impression of it without any effort to relieve or to resist it We abandon ourselves to grief and sink into dejection The spirit of resignation suggests such sentiments as can divert or alleviate the sensation of distress It renders us recollected and when that sensation cannot be suppressed draws out the vigour of our souls on purpose to sustain itInstead of endeavouring to restrain or mitigate the sensations of uneasiness we too often wilfully inflame them We suffer imagination to search out all the circumstances that can aggravate them and we incessantly ruminate upon them By the multitude of our thoughts we are loaded with supernumerary evils our souls are broken into peevishness and irritated into discontent Resignation checks the wanderings of imagination it turns it to such views as can divert our grief we think how much worse our situation might have been and how much worse the full punishment of  our sins would render it and we become pleased that it is so tolerable we consider the good ends to which it may be improved and embrace it as the means of confirming us in those virtues to which it gives scope and opportunityBy our yielding to the impressions of pain or disappointment they are enabled to destroy our relish for all enjoyment It is the business of resignation to establish such composure and serenity of mind as may leave us open to all the satisfactions which our condition can afford Sensible of one evil and groaning under it we forget not our remaining comforts we suffer not ourselves to undervalue them we rejoice that they too are not withdrawn  THE irreligious attend not to the hand of God in what befals them or if they acknowledge it it is only to censure the ordinations of his Providence to complain of the severity of his dispensations to murmur and repine to set their mouth against the heavens and even it may be to blaspheme the perfections of the divine nature The pious man on the contrary ascribes all that befals him to the benevolent and wise appointment of God and even when he cannot help lamenting his own condition he suffers not himself to think hardly or to complain of Providence He  inculcates on himself that what God wills must be better for him than what he wills himself though at present he perceives not how being sent by that gracious God who  doth not afflict willingly  Lam iii  it must be sent for his own and for the general good We every day submit not only with patience but of choice to what is disagreeable in itself when we know it to be useful we endure the bitterness of medicine for the sake of health we cheerfully undergo fatigue for the sake of gain A full conviction of the wisdom and benevolence of Providence may justly be as effectual for composing our souls into resignation as the prospect of any determinate advantage Under the power of that conviction we acquiesce in poverty or distress as in unknown ways by its concomitants or its consequences certainly subservient to our present or our future good In adversity forget not how many mercies you have constantly derived from the bounty of God retain a sense of them continue to be thankful for them your gratitude for them will nourish resignation for the contrary evils  Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil  Job ii  In afflicting you he only recals what was always his own free gift the  health which you now find broken the riches which you have lost the beloved child or the dear friend for whose death you mourn were only lent to you by the Lord of all things for a while you owe him thanks for having lent them so long and should restore them with cheerfulness whenever he demands them  the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord  Chap i  He who giveth liberally and delighteth in beneficence we are sure would not take away but for the best reasons His mercies and his chastisements are links of the same chain of wise arrangements for our good  Why  then  art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me Hope in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God  Psal xliii    AN unresigned temper breaks in upon the affection which we owe to men as well as upon the regard which we owe to God It fixes our view on those persons who have contributed to our disappointments or our calamities and it kindles wrath rancour and revenge against them It excites these passions against such as have been only the innocent occasions of our losses or our sufferings  It directs our attention to those who are in more fortunate circumstances than ourselves and it tortures us with envy It produces a settled dissatisfaction which breaks out in ill humour peevishness and abuse towards all who are connected with us Resignation on the contrary by establishing continual serenity of soul prepares the heart for exercising benevolence in every situation Under the heaviest pressure of distress it leads us to treat our companions our friends our families our dependants with a placid sweetness and mild though perhaps melancholy complacence It permits not a wish for bettering our own state by robbing any man of his prosperity It distinguishes between the innocent occasions and the guilty causes of our troubles and even towards the latter it represses the emotions of malevolence repentance and forgiveness are all that it prays may overtake them It considers all second causes as only instruments employed by the Supreme Ruler and by respect to him it softens all our sentiments of them It enabled David to overlook the inveteracy of Shimei and to say  Let him alone and let him curse for the Lord hath hidden him▪ it may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day  Sam xvi    THE continuance of adversity is apt to depress men's spirits or to produce impatience They weary themselves with vain wishes that their condition were other than it is or can be and in all their wishes they interpose not if it be the will of the Lord Struggling against his appointment they attempt to extricate themselves by unlawful means or fainting under his correction they become incapable of using any means for their deliverance sit down in sullen indolence and sink into despondence Resignation condemns not the wish for deliverance from evil but it prevents its swelling into anxiety and it keeps it in subordinacy to God's good pleasure It converts all the wishes of the heart into devout supplications and directs them to heaven in fervent prayers to God most high It is so far from being inconsistent with innocent endeavours to remove what occasions us disquiet that it qualifies us for employing them to the best advantage The inward serenity which it establishes enables us quickly to discern what steps we have it in our power to take and the tranquillity and firmness of mind which it produces prepares us for pursuing them with prudence vigour and perseverance Composed and recollected in ourselves we can always perceive and execute what our situation requires At the same time resignation  teaches us to reject with abhorrence every sinful method of extricating ourselves however effectual it may seem to be  Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil  Psal xxxvii  as long as without doing evil you cannot better your condition it is the will of God that it be not bettered and it is your duty to reconcile yourselves to it as it is to  trust in the Lord and do good  to  rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him  Ver  When all present circumstances are the most unpromising when immediate deliverance appears impossible yet we despair not of deliverance we know that God can nevertheless send it by the most unlikely and unexpected means and we indulge the confidence that he will send it if it be truly good for us and send it at the fittest season But if he should never send it we repine not we yield not to dejection it will be as God pleases and that is always the best and must demand our contented submission If every worldly enjoyment be taken from us we still repose ourselves in the wisdom and goodness of God's inscrutable designs saying with David  I looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul but thou  O Lord art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living  Psal cxlii    OUR resignation must extend its influence backward to the past To discontent on account of our present situation the restlessness of imagination often superadds an uneasy and repining recollection of events which happened long ago There is reason for our reproaching ourselves with such events when they were owing to our own misconduct yet even in this case repentance for that misconduct is sufficient and perpetual regret for the inconveniences which it once occasioned is wrong  Wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins  Lam iii  But when disagreeable events arose not from our own fault no natural principle can lead us to allow the remembrance of them to eat out our present satisfaction It should rather heighten the relish of succeeding ease and prosperity To be continually thinking how much better our situation might have been at times than it actually was to retain resentment against the authors of our past misfortunes to remain implacable against Providence for permitting them to cherish the fretful remembrance of them and the remains  of that discontent which their presence produced to become by these means habitually sullen and dissatisfied with a world in which we have not been always so prosperous as we wished▪ is perversely to enter into a conspiracy against our own enjoyment  THE pressure of a present evil may plead some excuse for frail man if he murmur under it but when the evil itself is past to retain the ill temper which it produced is inexcusable Deliverance from calamity is the subject not of murmuring but of thankfulness If it has left some consequences which affect your present state yet we ought by degrees to reconcile ourselves to them The first assault of trouble may surprize us into peevishness but when we have had leisure to bethink ourselves and to ponder it deliberately it is but reasonable to expect we should call up our resolution collect our courage invigorate our souls to bear it apply ourselves to the peculiar duties for which it gives opportunity and form ourselves to that cheerful enjoyment of life which becomes those who live in a world regulated by infinite perfection By the treach  ry and malice of his brethren Joseph had undergone all the hardships of long slavery and imprisonment but they left neither resentment nor  repining When these brethren afterwards stood before him pierced with remorse and overwhelmed with terror instead of so much as upbraiding them in the gentlest terms he with equal generosity and piety turned up the fairest side of their conduct and his past condition  Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth so now it was not you that sent me hither but God  Gen xlv    RESIGNATION exerts itself in trust and reliance upon God for the future part of our existence Formed reasonable creatures capable of foreseeing the consequences of our own actions and the effects likely to result from other causes we cannot be wholly unconcerned about the future We guess what it will be and regard it either with hope or with fear It is this wise and gracious constitution of our nature that fits us for regulating our conduct by the prospect of what may be for being affected with good or evil before they become present and for using our endeavours to obtain the one and avoid the other But many convert it into a source of disquiet and  vexation by the abuse of it solicitude and impatience about future events creates them far greater unhappiness than the sense of present evils They are ever prying into those designs of Providence which are unsearchable to human sagacity and miserable because they find themselves unable to discover them They wish for some good thing and grieve themselves because they cannot obtain it they hope to obtain another but repine that it is not already obtained They distress themselves with terrors which will never be realized the very possibility of trouble or disappointment fills them with apprehensions if it become probable they are overpowered with dread and either wait its approach with despondence or essay to prevent it by doing what is wrong and if it become imminent  trouble and anguish make them afraid and prevail against them as a king ready to the battle  Job xv  Strangers to resignation we must be restless in forming schemes for the future fearful of their failing and a prey to painful and unavailing cares  IT belongs to God to determine what events shall fill up our lives our part is to submit to them whatever they be to  prepare ourselves for bearing them and to exert ourselves in improving them Sensible of our own ignorance concerning what would be best for us we should refer all our concerns to the direction of Him who is infinitely wiser than we and more concerned for our true happiness than ourselves can beUnable to conjecture what may be before us we should rejoice that it is only what God wills saying with David  I trusted in thee O Lord I said Thou art my God my times are in thy hand  Psal xxxi  In respect of all events without exception or reserve we should exercise such implicit confidence as Abraham showed when at the call of God he  by faith  left his native land and  went out not knowing whither he went  Heb xi  The language of our souls ought always to be Lead me O God whither thou wilt I willingly follow thee send what is truly good for me though I should be averse from receiving it withhold what would be hurtful though I should most earnestly desire it It is not in the power of man to frustrate the ordinations of Providence the severest of them every mortal must endure however bitterly he repine and however violently he struggle against them by reconciling our souls to them we only  prefer the decrees of unerring wisdom to the suggestions of our own folly and escape the agonies which frowardness superadds to the intrinsic weight of our distresses  I MEAN not that resignation forbids our wishing for an easy and comfortable state in preference to a lot of sorrow and calamity The wish is natural and inevitable But we should indulge it only in subordination to God's good pleasure We should not suffer it either to settle too peremptorily on a particular object which for what we know he may see meet to refuse or to swell into anxiety and carefulness We should check every propensity to suppose any one of the uncertain enjoyments of this world essential to our happiness If God ordain what is most contrary to our wishes it is our duty to keep ourselves in readiness to meet it without sullenness and without violent perturbation  RESIGNATION must not be confounded with improvident thoughtlessness about futurity It permits the most attentive forecast but it renders it calm and composed It permits us to employ all our prudence and activity in executing every innocent design but it teaches us having employed them to refer the event to Him who rules the world avoiding painful  solicitude about success or disappointment Using the fittest means in our power for accomplishing our purposes our dependence should be on God for rendering them effectual and our prayers for success should be with the reservation of its being his will  I would seek unto God and to God would I commit my cause  Job v  If he frustrate my endeavours I will not peevishly complain of cross accidents but cheerfully acquiesce in it as the doing of him who permits only what is best and fittest Assiduous in all the duties which suit the condition allotted to me by him I will rest satisfied that whether my desires be gratified or disappointed it shall be well with me and assure myself that he will bestow upon me though not perhaps what I would chuse yet what it is proper for perfect goodness and wisdom to bestow  For the Lord will not cast off for ever but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies  Lament iii    RESIGNATION exerts itself in dependence upon God for all the interests of the future as well as of the present life Looking forward to the God of his salvation believing in the Son of God and relying on his mediation  who  is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God by him  Heb vii  yielding himself to the influence of the Holy Spirit to  fulfil in him all the good pleasure of God's goodness and the work of faith with power  Thess i  and exerting himself strenuously by his assistance in doing the will of his heavenly Father the good man cherishes through life the blessed hope of immortal happiness Conscious of his integrity he is confident that for the sake of Christ God will pardon all his imperfections Careful to perform the terms of the gospel he expects without tormenting doubts the promised reward He shrinks not trembling from the darkness and solitude of the grave he trusts that God will be his companion and his guide amidst its unexplored gloom when his breath is going out  he commits the keeping of his soul to God in welldoing as unto his faithful Creator  Pet iv  and transported into the world of spirits he finds that his dependence was not in vain that the issue surpasses his fondest expectations resignation is lost in love hope yields to fruition trust is converted into fulness of joy  SUCH submission in respect of the present such unrepining recollection of the past and  such dependence for the future are the g  +nuine exertions of that temper of resignation which is justly due to God as the good th  wise and the almighty Governour of the universe the sole Disposer of our lot That essential principle in our constitution which makes us easy in the want of what belongs not to our state but to other ranks of creatures piety cherishes into dutiful resignation to the ordination of our Maker in things which may belong to the state of men but which he sees fit to deny to us The lot of every man is fixt within its own limits and cannot be altered by our solicitude it is folly not to comply with it it is fixt within these limits by infinite perfection we may embrace it cheerfully  It is good that a man should both hope and wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord  Lam iii  Resignation is a temper singularly requisite and useful in the present stateWere it cultivated and exercised with sufficient care it would render our wills coincident in all things with the will of God make all our desires to terminate and our souls to rest in his appointment and enable us to proceed composedly through all the vicissitudes of this world to the full enjoyment of Him in the next It dislodges many vices  from the heart it excludes the stubbornness of selfwill the effeminacy of voluptuousness the rapacity of covetousness the eagerness of false ambition the violence of grief the fierceness of anger the dejections of fear the exorbitance of desire the grumblings of envy and the clamorousness of complaint It implies many of the most important virtues of the Christian life exercised in submission to the defects and imperfections of our lot it establishes contentment in bearing its distresses patience and in encountering its dangers fortitude It is interwoven with pious trust and it shoots out into religious joy To a superficial eye resignation seems to be altogether passive but it issues in the most active virtue By moulding our whole souls into an entire conformity to our condition it enables us to occupy with propriety the sphere assigned to us to act cheerfully the part befitting it and in the most unpleasant situations to apply with alacrity and vigour to whatever duties they demand Drawing us off from solicitude about events it directs our principal attention to the defeat of the temptations and the improvement of the opportunities resulting from our condition that by this conduct we may be warranted to indulge hope of the divine protection  WOULD you acquire or carry to greater perfection the spirit of resignation you must bestow your first pains on the root from which it grows you must form a just conception of the benignity and wisdom of God's almighty providence and by close and frequent meditation fix that conception in your minds and render it lively familiar and ever present to your thoughts Resignation cannot thrive in a soil choaked up by earthly passions we must prepare our hearts for the reception of it by selfgovernment and selfdenial immoderate desires are necessarily insatiable abundance cannot satisfy them it only enlarges them importunate desires operate with a violence and turbulence inconsistent with the tranquillity of resignation both render us incapable of submission and deference to him who withholds their gratification Every temper is rendered habitual by congruous exercise Endeavour to exercise resignation in bearing the several events of life accustom yourselves to exert it both in trivial and important matters be not unguardedly ruffled by inconsiderable crosses suffer not the greatest disappointments to overwhelm your spirit with excessive or permanent vexation when at one time you have failed in maintaining your composure labour to maintain it more perfectly on the next occasion Exercise your resignation likewise in devotion  retreat frequently from the world to your God under a lively sense of his intimate presence with you give scope to your sentiments of dependence and confidence in addressing him explicitly  commit your way unto the Lord  Psal xxxvii  and refer all your concerns to his disposal implore his protection and his assistance for resting in the assurance of it  Trust in him at all times ye people and pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us  Psal lxii    Wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the Lord  Psal xxvii xxxi    SERMON VII SUBJECTION TO THE AUTHORITY OF GOD  PSALM cxix  Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently  THE will of God may be considered in two lights as regarding either the events which befal us or the conduct which is prescribed to us Viewed in the former light it is the object of resignation viewed in the latter of subjection and obedience Resignation arises from a sense of God's right to dispose of us and of the wisdom and goodness of all his dispositions subjection arises from a sense of his right to command us aided by a conviction of the equity and benevolence of all his laws The one is a willing submission to God's natural government of the world the other a willing submission to  his moral government United they complete that loyalty of heart which we owe to the Sovereign of the universe It is the latter that my text leads us to consider In this address  Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently  or as it is translated by some  Thou hast commanded thy precepts that they may be diligently kept  David acknowledges that God publishes his laws with an authority which demands our obedience and expresses his own disposition to yield obedience A sense of duty towards God a subjection of heart to his statutes is indispensibly incumbent on us as the subjects of his government and is the immediate principle of compliance with the dictates of his will For illustrating this important part of piety let us consider  FIRST That authority by which all his laws exact our obedience and  SECONDLY That subjection of heart which is due to the authority of these laws  FIRST Let us consider the nature of God's authority over us or of his right to prescribe us laws which we are obliged to observe  IN order to perceive it we must attend to the constitution of our moral nature we must reflect on the operation of our own conscience From it our very idea of authority is primarily derived Conscience is our supreme power it claims a right to govern all our passions and actions and it forces us to feel that it has a right to govern them By it we  are a law unto ourselves  Rom ii  In its very exertion we without reasoning or study perceive the authority of its dictates and our obligation to regulate all our motions according to themWhat it approves we are immediately sensible is right and ought to be done what it disapproves is wrong and ought not to be done It does not merely propose our duty it enjoins it it does not merely discern good from evil it commands and it forbidsWhen our heart tells us that we have violated its commands we condemn ourselves we are stung with remorse conscious of ill desert and apprehensive of misery but when we reflect on our having fulfilled them we become possessed of selfcomplacence inward joy the feeling of good desert and the hope of happiness Such is our original idea of authority the very acting of conscience involves a sense of the authority of its own decrees and correspondent  to this of our obligation to comply with them  IT is conscience likewise that makes us capable of perceiving and teaches us to acknowledge authority in one person over another It enables us to distinguish a lawful superior from a tyrant or usurper it recognizes in the former a right to command us which belongs not to the latter One of our fellowmen may become our lawful superior and whenever he does conscience requires us to obey him and enforces our obedience to him by the very same sentiments and exertions as our submission to its own decrees The counsels of a friend are to our feeling essentially different from the orders of a superior A master a father a ruler a sovereign have a just authority to which we  must be subject for conscience sake  Rom xiii  But when we turn our thoughts to God and consider his perfections and the relations in which he stands to us conscience acknowledges an higher authority and a more sacred obligation All the characters which can imply a right to command us are united in him and belong to him in an infinitely higher sense than to any other being  OUR parents are not the proper causes of our existence they are only the instruments by means of whom we receive it Yet from this they derive an authority over us which all men own to be just and feel to be sacred Disregard to it is necessarily and universally accounted not only base but unnatural God is the First Cause who made our parents the instruments of bringing us into life he is the proper Author of our being and our whole nature His authority is therefore greater and more absolute to oppose it is baser and more unnatural  Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of our spirits  than to the  fathers of our flesh  Heb xii    Thy hands have made me and fashioned me  therefore ought I to  learn  and to keep all  thy commandments  Psal cxix  Because thou art my  Creator  I am indispensibly bound to  remember  Eccles xii  thee and to devote myself to thy will Thou who gavest me all my powers hast an unlimited right to direct the application of them to employ them in any action which thou forbiddest would be to employ them against him whose they wholly are  A MASTER has a right to the labour and obedience of a servant while he sustains him  and a prince to the allegiance of his subjects while he protects them The Lord is  our Master in heaven  Eph vi    the Lord is our Lawgiver the Lord is our King  Isa xxxiii  He has a perfect right to our service and allegiance he supports our very being he gives energy to all our powers If he withdrew his preserving hand for a single moment they would all be blasted and we must fall into nothing To resist his authority to transgress his laws is to affect independence upon him on whom we are totally dependent it is to oppose him with those faculties which we retain and can exercise only by his permission  A FELLOWCREATURE who has the justest authority over us may give commands which are of no obligation they may be unlawful and wrong But the authority of God is absolute in all things the obligation of his laws admits of no exception His is perfect rectitude of nature he can will nothing that is wrong  Wherefore his law is holy and his commandment holy just and good  Rom vii    The law of the Lord is perfect the testimony of the Lord is sure the statutes of the Lord are right the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether  Psal xix  In acting contrary  to such laws there must always be pollution and depravity but while we observe them we must continue pure and unblameable  they do iniquity who walk in his ways  Psal cxix    THE benevolence of God's nature gives additional authority to his laws Men may issue their orders without regard to the interest of those from whom they require obedience or even with a view to hurt them But perfect goodness can enact no laws in the moral world but such as are intended for the most extensive happiness of the rational creation They are designed to point out and enforce that course by which moral agents may promote the general good and their own true interest By violating the laws of God we do what we can to bring misery on ourselves and others By making them the invariable rule of our temper and our conduct we contribute our part to the perfection and order of the universe and we pursue our own felicity  The Lord  hath  commanded us to do all these statutes for our good always  Deut vi  They can have no other aim They are the dictates of pure benevolence  More to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb  Psal xix    WITH the best intention possible men may prescribe us rules which shall prove of very pernicious consequence They are fallible and may mistake their tendency But God's wisdom is unerring he knows all the tendencies of his laws They must be fit for swering the purpose of benevolence Obedience to them cannot but produce happinessThe certainty that they willnot mislead us adds confidence to our conviction that we ought to be guided by them In them the uncreated  wisdom uttereth her voice and crieth I will make known my words unto you receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver I lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of righteousness  Prov i viii    RECTITUDE benevolence and wisdom united in a superior degree give a man an authority and influence among his fellows to which they of their own accord pay a deference though he has not power to enforce it This is the truest authority Mere power by creating dependence may compel submission but the submission is always reluctant and unwilling On the contrary that which we yield  to the directions of superior worth and wisdom is spontaneous and hearty Our heartiest and our most cheerful submission is therefore due to God All his precepts are the dictates of infinite perfection the counsels of goodness and wisdom in conjunction for regulating our whole conduct can we imagine ourselves at liberty not to regard them They are a transcript of his own excellence and can they be but binding upon all those creatures whom he has formed capable of becoming partakers of his excellence Every precept of God has an inherent authority implied in its excellence its necessity and its utility an injunction from the Allperfect carries along with it an immediate obligation upon us to obey it  BUT strong and commanding as this immediate and internal obligation is our obedience is not left to rest on it alone Every perfect law contains a sanction as well as a precept All the precepts of God's law are enforced by sanctions Punishment is denounced against the transgressors and reward is promised to the observers of them The strength of the obligation thence resulting is confessed by all the force of sanctions exacts obedience from those who would pay little regard to the righteousness of the precept Human laws  generally owe their influence almost wholly to their sanctions their authority is slighted when these are not strictly and vigorously executed and by impotence or injustice in the execution the best laws are rendered totaliy ineffectual With the divine law it never can be so The venerable authority of its precepts is awfully supported by its sanctions They are the most important and interesting and it is certain that they will be executed They can neither be wrested by injustice nor defeated through impotenceThe divine Lawgiver is  a God of truth and without iniquity just and right is he  Deut xxxii  His perfect justice binds him to maintain the authority and vindicate the honour of his laws With incorruptible and undeviating righteousness he will inflict punishment on the disobedient and bestow reward on the obedient In his administration there can be no partiality When the proper time is come when this state of trial is ended he  will render to every man according to his deeds and there will be no respect of persons with God  Rom ii  Whatever sentence his justice pronounces his power will execute Power is the great support of the authority of laws among those who are disaflected to them it urges respect to them by rendering it our interest  and our only safety How tremendous is the authority of God's laws how inviolable their obligation It is defended by omnipotence  I am the almighty God walk before me  Gen xvii  The  one Lawgiver is able to save and to destroy  J  m iv  In the transgression of his laws there can be no security Justice armed with omnipotence on purpose to enforce them precludes the slightest hope of impunity Will ye by disobedience  provoke the Lord Are ye stronger than he  Cor x  or can ye by a gift pervert his judgment Misery shall be  the protion of a wicked man from God  Job xx    Though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished  Prov xi    Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the way of the Lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies  Psal cxix    In keeping of them there is great reward  Psal xix    So manifold are the foundations of God's authority over us On every possible principle he has a right to govern us by his laws His authority is supreme to it all other must give way it is sovereign over all the actions of the most exalted creatures and is by them acknowledged to be sovereign  his angels a  his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word  and the  sts  of heaven are  his ministers  that do his pleasure  Psal ciii  how then can the children of men plead an exemption from obedience His authority is absolute circumscribed by no limitation to render any thing incumbent on us it is only necessary that it be required by God to convince us that it is incumbent and to make us guilty in neglecting it it is sufficient that we know it to be required by him Whether it be suggested by nature or intimated by revelation whether it be enjoined by the dictates of conscience or imposed by a written precept we are bound to it by the whole strength of the divine authority  REASON qualifies us for reflecting on the constitution of our nature and teaches us that it is the workmanship of God that he made conscience a part of it that he gave it the authority which we feel it has to govern us and therefore that it is the will of our Maker that we should be governed by it It is he who hath by its notices  shewed thee O man what is good  and assured thee that  the Lord doth require  it  of thee  Mic vi  Thy conscience is and causes thee perceive that it is the deputy of the most High It bears his commission and it speaks in his name It affirms  and it proves itself to be the guide of life which he has appointed thee to follow It impresses an instantaneous and irresistible conviction that all its dictates are his  laws written in  thy  heart  P  m ii  It enacts them as his laws and it proclaims their sanctions While it punishes the violation of them with immediate remorse it denounces farther punishment from the hand of God it forces on thee a perception of demerit towards him and guiltiness in his sight and it f  lls thee with apprehension of the misery threatened in that perception While it approves the observance of them and rewards it with gladness of heart it likewise promises a higher reward it declares it worthy of God's approbation and inspires the hope of happiness from his favour  THE clearer and fuller publication of his statutes in his word is attended with the same authority All the holy men who by inspiration promulgated his moral laws inculcated them upon the consciences of men by  Thus saith the Lord  declared him the Almighty Vindicator of them and fortified them by promises and threatenings from his mouth Convinced that they spoke by commission from  him we are bound to receive all their words as the words of God The perfect revelation of his will in the gospel of Christ is stamped with the highest authority of heaven and entitled to our most dutiful and reverent submission by many circumstances of affecting peculiarity It has the authority of God explicitly interposed for it when by a voice from heaven he testified  This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased  HEAR YE HIM  Mat xvii  It has likewise the authority of the only begotten Son of God to  magnify the law and make it honourable  Isa xlii  he sent a divine messenger to promulgate it He said  They will reverence my Son  Mat xxi  His dignity bespeaks its infinite importance and recommends it to our most careful and conscientious observance In publishing the will of God Christ spoke not only as the messenger and as the Son of God but also as the Saviour of mankind who has recovered us to the ability of obeying it and restored us to a capacity of obtaining through him the reward of obedience who by dying for us has purchased our service to God By him God demands our obedience on a new title superadded to all the other rights of his sovereign dominion He demands it as  God  our Saviour  Tim i  He requires us to  serve him in holiness and righteousness  because he has  delivered  us  out of the hands of our enemies  Luke i  He requires us to  glorify him in our body and in our spirit  because he hath  bought us with a price  Cor vi  By exacting the death of Christ for our redemption he has made an awful declaration of the sacred obligation of his laws In the gospel obedience to them is secured by the great sanctions of eternal life and eternal death clearly revealed strikingly described and not only confirmed by the most express promises and threatenings but also sealed by the blood of Christ  WHAT now is implied in that subjection of heart which the authority of God's laws demands from us To explain this was the SECOND thing proposed and in explaining it we will be best directed by attention to the same constitution of human nature which has led us to a just conception of the divine authorityOur nature consists of two parts conscience enjoining what God requires us to do and appetites and passions either opposing or complying with what it enjoins For our being in subjection to the laws of our Creator it is necessary both that conscience enjoin with  force and that appetite and passion obey with readiness A temper of subjection therefore implies two thingsthat a sense of duty towards God or a regard to his will be the ruling principle of our conductand that all our other principles of action submit to be regulated by it  A REGARD to the will of God must be our ruling principle of conduct The very definition of authority is a right to govern us the very idea of a law is a declaration of the will of a superior obligatory upon us Conscience which is the original law of God to us and the immediate percipient of the obligation of all his laws differs essentially from our other active powers It does not merely incline or impel us it prescribes authoritatively and pronounces it unlawful and wrong not to listen to it Each of the others is intended to influence us only on some occasions in such of our actions as it is particularly adapted to but conscience is intended to influence us at all times it is alike adapted to all our actions To govern them all is its right and it is our leading principle whenever it has power to maintain this rightGod gave us his law to be our rule in all cases and at all times without exception  A GENUINE regard to its authority will first of all render us solicitous to know what it is that God requires of us To have no concern so much as to know our duty is inconsistent with the faintest desire to do it it betrays the grossest indifference about it it is pouring the utmost contempt upon the authority by which it is required To listen to him when he speaks is the very lowest mark of deference that we can pay to a superior an equal would with reason be offended if even from him we should withhold it Supine or wilful ignorance of the will of God proclaimed in his moral laws marks many among mankind for  children of disobedience  Eph ii  They bestow no attention on their obligations Like brute beasts they heedlessly follow the present inclination without reflecting whether it be right or wrong They are at no pains to consult their conscience how they ought to act and when it spontaneously interposes and obtrudes its admonitions on them instead of hearkening to it that they may learn God's law from its mouth they labour to silence it that it may not testify against their sins nor interrupt the course of their transgressions They are at no pains to study the precepts of God's word if ever they cast an eye upon  them it is not that they may understand their real import and apply them honestly to their direction in the ways of virtue but that they may explain them away and reconcile them to their sins In such men consci  nce can have no power it is so far from being the supreme principle that it cannot be properly one principle of their conduct Their own will their inclination ever varying and tossing them about at random not at all the will of God gives the colour to their whole behaviour To have no sense of good and evil is the consummation of depravity and the sense of them can be only in proportion to our knowledge of them In the knowledge of our duty the foundation of a temper of obedience must be laid Wherever knowledge fails practice must fail of course A prevailing regard to the sacredness of obligation will not suffer us to be willingly ignorant of any particular of its demandsThat it may prove a principle of real virtue we must likewise be careful to avoid every misapprehension of our duty The delusive mists of prejudice and passion often obscure the light of the divine laws set before us a false form of virtue and pervert the sentiments of conscience An erroneous conscience gives its sanction to vice and enforces the wrong as right It may impose upon us as the will of God w  at is most repugnant to  his will it may lead us into heinous sin in the full persuasion that we  do God service  John xvi  An uninformed conscience can be no guide and a misinformed conscience must be a false guide Ignorance of our duty subverts the power of conscience mistakes about it render that power dangerous the more strenuously it exerts its authority the more intent we are on fulfilling its dictates it will the more certainly mislead us and the more irresistibly drive us into sinTo dispel our ignorance and correct our errors God has given us the revelation of his will Its divine authority binds us to study it with the greatest diligence and to study it with a single and honest intention to learn what God really requires of us to  consider  his  testimonies  Psal cxix  and  meditate in  his  precepts  that we may  have respect unto his ways  Ver  Even the plain precepts of God's law may be misunderstood or misapplied they have sometimes been wrested to authorize the blackest crimes It might have been prevented by attention to the native sentiments of the human heart to the corrupt propensities of man the pure law of God must be contradictory but it will always approve itself to conscience and fall in with our best affections If it be repugnant to these it is doubtless misinterpreted  The suggestions of our moral nature and the maxims of Scripture mutually illustrate one another and must be studied in conjunction A conscience enlightened by the full understanding of God's written law will be an unerring guide  THAT a regard to the will of God may be the governing principle in our hearts we must not only clearly understand its dictates but feelingly perceive their obligation To be qualified for holding us in subjection to its authority conscience having ascertained our duty justly must impress a lively and ardent sense of it A callous conscience is insensible its perceptions are dull its warnings against transgression and its reproofs for our having transgressed are faint and feeble it can be touched only with heinous guilt The calls to action come suddenly upon us if conscience be asleep they are past before it can bestir itself to offer its advice we have violated our duty before it was in condition to remind us of it Exempt from seasonable admonition serious remonstrance and quick remorse men can have no effectual restraint from going on in disobedience But where conscience reigns it is constantly awake ready to perceive our duty in the moment of action and alert in suggesting it The  senses  are  exercised to discern  both good and evil  Heb v  and they rest not in cold discernment They have a delicacy of feeling which perceives every sin with keen disgust and every virtue with eager complacence goodness is embraced with warm affection evil is rejected with hatred and abhorrence The sensibility of conscience renders its dictates striking fit to affect the heart and to actuate the conduct Its decisions are revered because they are pronounced with vivacity and impressed with earnestness Keeping a watchful and piercing eye upon our conduct it is quick and active in  accusing or else excusing  us  Rom ii  it is soon aware of every deviation from our duty the smallest sin is recollected with regret a heinous transgression breaks the spirit into contrition the slightest hint is sufficient to rouse the heart to remorse for our having sinned against the Lord The authority of conscience is confirmed and a respect to all the divine commandments enforced by the experience that every act of disobedience is followed by pungent sorrow and that only the strictest adherence to our duty can secure our peace of mind The encomium given to Josiah is that his  heart was tender  the sense of the encomium is obvious in his history reflecting on the former iniquities of his kingdom he  humbled himself and wept before the Lord  Kings xxii Chron xxxiv  and he  made a covenant before the Lord to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul  Kings xxiii Chron xxxiv    and he declined neither to the right hand nor to the left  Ver  It is the very character which I have now described  CONSCIENCE is both a power of perception and a principle of action Its influence as a principle will always be in proportion to the clearness and the strength of its perceptions If it apprehends our duty darkly and uncertainly it must impose it with hesitation if it feels obligation faintly it can inculcate it but feebly but when it is accurately informed it dictates with assurance when its sensations are affecting it commands with energy It is its vigour as a principle of action that gives effect to its perceptions that secures the application of them to the actual direction of our conduct and impresses us with a prevailing regard to the will of God Entitled by the original constitution of our nature and the appointment of him who formed it to rule within us its right is notwithstanding often violated and its authority despised because it  has lost its power We see what is right and yet do what is wrong We hear its commands and we counteract them Its throne is usurped by passion We are in a temper of disobedience to God That his laws may govern us conscience must be reinstated in its just supremacy Its power must be commensurate with its authority It must be able to enforce whatever it pronounces to be right All who are not perfectly abandoned pay some regard to conscience they allow it some influence in its turn with their appetites and passions they act from it in some instances they do some things because they are right and forbear others because they are wrong But this is not enough Like the Almighty whose deputy it is it ought to have absolute and uncontrouled dominion It should make itself to be obeyed in every case and in opposition to the claims of every appetite and passion Our concern should be not what is pleasant or what is profitable but solely what is right and good Once informed of what God really requires we must hold it indispensible There remains no room for a moment's suspence whether we will comply with it or not The language of duty is  All that the Lord hath said will we do and be obedient  Exod xxiv  A  darling passion craves indulgence an inclination rises to the action by which it might be gratified but conscience intimates that God forbids it our  heart standeth in awe of his word  Psal cxix  and we  refrain our feet from every evil way that we may keep his word  Ver  The corruption of our nature struggles against the exertion of a good affection we are indisposed to a good action conscience reminds us that God requires it we  esteem all his precepts concerning all things to be right  Ver  and we rouse ourselves to fulfil them Conscience in full possession of its natural dominion forces on us an habitual attention to its directions it preserves them so intimately present to our view and entwists them so entirely with all our thoughts that they readily occur and determine our choice in the hour of action In every situation we take time to ask ourselves What is the duty belonging to it what the part which God wills us now to act  His testimonies are our counsellors  Ver    His word have we hid in our heart that we might not sin against him  Ver  By our bringing all our intentions before it taking its judgment concerning all our motions and uniformly complying with its dictates it is daily invigorated Every transgression weakens its power every act of obedience confirms and  extends its influence By the habit of submitting implicitly to its decisions its sway becomes more and more sovereign and irresistible till it  bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ  Cor x    THAT our hearts may become subject to the law of God it is necessary not only that conscience be invigorated and enabled to enforce our duty powerfully but likewise that all our other principles of action be formed to submission to it and regulated in all their exertions according to its dictates Conscience is not the whole of human nature along with that supreme faculty we have many appetites passions and affections which attach us to a variety of objects and impel us to a variety of actions Whenever their objects are presented they necessarily rise and instinctively urge us to those actions by which they may be obtained If the only practicable means of obtaining them in any case be disallowed by conscience and condemned by the law of God they will in proportion to their strength instigate us to violate conscience and deviate from our duty The scripture therefore represents our nature as consisting of two opposite principles  the flesh  and  the spirit  contending for the  dominion of the heart  The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other  Gal v  The law of God cannot but often lay a restraint upon our inclinations and for this reason the scripture acknowledges it to be a  yoke  and requires us to  take  it  upon us  Mat xi    OUR natural passions enured to no controul strengthened by continual indulgence and sustained by the corruption of our hearts are too refractory to be governed by a sense of duty They rise with assurance and with an irresistible force drive us on to gratify them Conscience pronounces it unlawful but in vain it attempts to restrain them but it is opposed and defeated Its power is broken and its authority renounced The heart is froward and perverse  revolting and rebellious  Jer v  the life is a course of disobedience and transgression against the laws of heaven  They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh  Rom viii  They  fulfil the desires of the flesh  Eph ii  They are  disobedient and unto every good work reprobate  Tit i  They are  the servants of sin not the servants of God  they  yield  their  members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin not as instruments of righteousness unto holiness  While  sin reigns  within them it must  have dominion  over  them and force them to  obey it in the lusts thereof  Rom vi    So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be  Chap viii  The strongest sense of duty cannot determine us effectually except our sensual appetites our corrupt passions and our worldly affections be likewise weakened While these preserve their strength they will maintain a continual opposition to it they will prevail alternately and distract the soul It is like a war carried on between parties of equal power the success of either can never be decisive A conscience acting with vigour and passions operating with undiminished force produce by their incessant struggles that harassing state of mind which the apostle describes  that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I To will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do I find a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law  which is in my members O wretched  who shall deliver me from this body  of death  Rom vii  The power of conscience conjoined with ungovernable passions can only fill us with unsufferable anguish in the sense of our continual disobedience To render it productive either of obedience or tranquillity all those passions and principles of action which oppose our obligations must be weakened and subdued We must  keep under our body and bring it into subjection  Cor ix  We must  through the spirit mortify the deeds of the body  Rom viii  For enabling us to mortify them the spirit of God is given and all the strength which he infuses into our hearts we must employ in checking and in conquering every propensity to sin Our passions cannot be extirpated nor can their impulses be brought perfectly to coincide with the dictates of conscience In this earthly state they always meet their objects they are excited by the view of them they aim at indulgence and they retain some power In the best some corruption remains the seeds of disobedience are not wholly destroyed there arises now and then a wish for a forbidden gratification they  cannot  always  do the things that  they  would  Gal v  they fall at times into acts of sin But vicious passions are generally restrained by being restrained they become weaker and weaker they are enured to submit to the limitations  of duty and accustomed to cease from importunity whenever their demands are perceived to be forbidden In proportion as they are brought to yield to the controul of obligation we become  willing and obedient  Isa i  and our  hearts inclined to God's testimonies  Psal cxix    ALL the affections of our souls are by no means equally contradictory to conscience or alike apt to seduce us from our duty The benevolent affections rather fall in with conscience and instigate us to fulfil its dictates They are the immediate principles of that conduct towards other men which conscience approves and God requires and the same affections directed to God and raised and refined by the infinity of his perfection are the first rudiments of piety and devotion When human nature is distinguished into the  spirit  and the  flesh  these affections are referred to the former the virtues into which they grow up by proper culture make a great part of  the fruits of the spirit  enumerated by the apostle  love peace longsuffering gentleness goodness meekness  their opposites  hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions envyings  as well as the natural effects of the sensual and the selfish passions are reckoned among  the works of the flesh  Gal v  and can become no other In our depraved  state even our best affections need to be kept under the dominion of the ruling principle If they were indulged without any reserve they would degenerate into vice if their impulse were implicitly followed in every case it would lead us astray from what is right They must be restrained from improper exertions and regulated by the divine law But still they stand most in need of being cherished and strengthened The prevalence of vicious passions cumbers the soul like noxious weeds they choak the seeds of good affections prevent their growth and repress their exercise When the heart is cleared from the former the latter take root and flourish and bear their precious fruits Nourished by the dews of heaven purified by the influences of grace and preserved from irregularity and distortion they are the native principles of those virtues which God commands us to cultivate and of those good actions which he enjoins us to be diligent in performing Their vigour gives support to conscience they are engaged on its side They tend directly to the extinction of many of the vices which it most severely condemns they stand in diametrical opposition to every species of malevolence they are incompatible with the  filthiness of the spirit  Cor vii  they restrain us from  fulfilling the  evil  desires of the mind  Eph ii  they cooperate with the sense of duty in subduing the power of corruption They are the ministers which carry the commands of conscience into execution they are the  members  which we are called to  yield  and which alone are fit to be yielded  as instruments of righteousness unto God  Rom vi  To the entire subjection of our hearts to God the strength of good affections is no less necessary than the mortification of vicious passions We must be  alive unto God  as well as  dead unto sin  Ver  His law requires both abstinence from evil and diligence in welldoing the controul of corrupt inclinations only render us capable of the former it is the strength and energy of good affections that can qualify us for the latter If they were weak and languid it would render us unfit for that active holiness which is pleasing to God a necessary impulse to our duty would be wanting we would be indisposed to it and often neglect it notwithstanding the strongest perception of its obligation Our obedience would be only the outward service of the body the heart would not be engaged in it The fervour of good affections is the living spirit which must animate it  IT is when the heart is in this manner formed to obedience by the mortification of  vicious passions and the improvement of good affections that a sense of duty and a regard to God's law will become in fact our ruling principle It will actuate us in the practice of all the virtues but it cannot be in the very same sense the principle of them all It is obviously deducible from what has been said that they are of two kinds Some virtues are negative they consist in the restraint of such passions as tend to vice and issue in abstinence from the gratification of them Temperance justice and moderation of desire imply no positive disposition impelling to them they consist wholly in repressing the impetuosity and avoiding the excesses of sensual appetites and worldly passions Conscience disapproves the indulgence of these and condemns it as prohibited by God from respect to its judgment we set ourselves to subdue them that respect is the proper and only principle of our abstinence and this abstinence has no value in a religious and moral view but so far as it proceeds from that respect Other virtues are positive in their nature they consist in the strength and prevalence of pious or kind affections they issue in performance These affections and all the genuine exertions of them are good in themselves and on account of their inherent goodness are approved and enjoined by conscience  These are the proper and immediate springs of the practice which is congruous to them and give it value though we should not reflect on its being our duty If it were not the expression of these affections but proceeded solely from the sense of duty it would be obedience but it could not be charity or devotion Yet conscience operates along with them its approbation follows close upon their earliest motions it attends them in all progressive exertions it encourages and animates them it invigorates them by inculcating that the divine authority is interposed in their favour  THAT subjection of heart to the law of God which we have now explained is a very important temper It is indispensibly due to God as our lawgiver our sovereign and our king Capable of perceiving the right of a superior to command us we cannot on the least reflection but feel the right of the Supreme to exact the observance of all his precepts It is most beneficial to ourselves It is the most immediate preservative from sin It is the firmest support and the surest guard of every virtue If it prevail universal holiness must quickly ensue It alike secures but with the distinction belonging to their natures the practice of the moral virtues and the observance  of the positive appointments of God's will determining us to  do the one and not leave the other undone  Mat xxiii  but to  walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless  Luke i    CULTIVATE this temper with care suitable to its importance Meditate often on the sacredness and supremacy of the divine authority Form awful conceptions of it and render them familiar to you that you may learn to reverence the laws which are derived from it Consider all the reasons on which these laws are founded they will endear them to you You have been in situations of perplexity in which you were at a loss how to act the council of a wise and good man would have then been of all things the most desirable without the laws of God every step of your conduct would be perplexed and intricate and every moment you must be uncertain what you ought to do they are the directions of infinite perfection for the whole of your behaviour shall not his  commandments  then be our  delights  They  give  us  understanding  that we may  live  Psal cxix  accustom yourselves to think and act according to them Bring every motion which rises in your hearts and every action  which you intend to the test of duty Invite your conscience to pronounce impartially whether it be right or wrong If it declare that it is forbidden if it be even doubtful whether it is allowed or not invariably forbear it To venture upon any thing till every suspicion of its innocence be removed is to offend conscience and to sin presumptuously against God What you are satisfied that he requires let no temptation prevail upon you to neglect Implore the divine assistance to conquer the disobedience and corruption of your hearts and to  renew  you  in the spirit of your mind  Eph iv  to  take away the stony heart out of your flesh and give you an heart of flesh and put  his  spirit within you and cause you to walk in  his  statutes and to keep  his  judgments and do them  Ezek xxxvi    SERMON VIII REGARD TO THE JUDGMENT OF GOD  ISA xxxiii  The Lord is our Judge  THE constitution of human nature permits us not to be indifferent to the sentiments of others concerning our character and conduct A total disregard to them would shew depravity of soul a great unconcernedness about them would betray the want of that delicate sensibility which is inseparable from true worth The judgment of the virtuous and discerning is for its own sake an object of affection to every human heart their good opinion we desire with ardour and reflect upon with joy their ill opinion we regard with aversion to have incurred it overwhelms us with sorrow and confution But if we be particularly connected with them especially if we in any respect depend upon them their good or their ill opinion by being of  advantage or disadvantage to us becomes still more interesting  RELIGION eradicates none of these determinations of nature It grafts its exertions on them as their proper roots From inadequate objects it turns them to an object perfectly adequate It teaches us that  the Lord is our judge  It requires us to pay a supreme and constant regard to the judgment of that God who alone can justly estimate our character and whose estimation of it is of infinite importance to us This regard is an essential part of the duty which we owe to God and it is a powerful incitement to that course of life which is pleasing to him and productive of our own happiness both in this world and in the next  IN the present discourse I propose to consider it  first  in its principle and  secondly  in its operation  FIRST I shall point out the proper  principle  of a supreme regard to the judgment of God It is in brief a lively conception of Godas our omniscient witnessas necessarily approving or disapproving usand as our proper and righteous governor who will reward those whom he approves and punish those whom he disapproves  GOD is continually present with us intimately acquainted with our real characters the witness of all our thoughts and words and actions By this he is qualified for being in an eminent sense  our Judge  It is but a small part of our behaviour of which any man can be an eye witness and even that part he may know but imperfectly he sees our actions but he can often only guess at our motives and our intentions Of many of our actions he is wholly ignorant and therefore he can form no opinion about them But there is not a particular of our heart or our life▪ of our temper or our conversation exempt from the judgment of God for he knows and observes all things  The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good  Prov xv  His eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men  Psal xi    doth not he see my ways and count all my steps  Job xxxi  For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord and he pondereth all his goings  Prov v  When thou performest an act of beneficence with such secrecy that  thy left hand knoweth not what thy right hand doth  Mat vi  when in the retirement of thy closet the sigh of penitence or the aspiration of devotion rises from an upright heart it is not unobserved by  thy Father which seeth in secret  Ver    Neither is the iniquity  of men  hid  from  his  eyes  Jer xvi  he sets  our iniquities before him our secret sins in the light of his countenance  Psal xc    O Lord thou hast searched me and known me thou understandest my thoughts afar off and there is not a word in my tongue but lo O Lord thou knowest it altogether Thou hast beset me before and behind Whither shall I go from thy Spirit or whither shall I flee from thy presence  Psal cxxxix  When a person is present with us his sentiments concerning us become the object of our liveliest attention were he at a distance we could perhaps think of them with more indifference God is never  far from every one of us  Acts xvii  he is more intimately present with us than any creature can be It requires no stretch of imagination to conceive him privy to our inmost thoughts to every rising passion to the most hidden propensities of our souls it requires only that we really believe what is absolutely certain We may be we ought to be as strikingly sensible of his presence as of our own being  for in him we have our being  Ver  We may be as deeply convinced of his knowledge of all our motions as of our own consciousness of them His knowledge of them is more perfect than our own we may forget them but he cannot we may impose a false representation of them even upon ourselves  but not upon him  For the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts  Chron xxviii    and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do  Heb iv    THE God who is perfectly acquainted with all our dispositions and our actions cannot behold any one of them with indifference he observes them on purpose to estimate their real nature he necessarily approves or disapproves them It is this that renders his knowledge of them important We would consider ourselves as alone in the presence of a person who could not discern between right and wrong It is our being endued with a moral nature with a power which distinguishes good from evil and regards them with contrary sentiments that renders one man at all capable of judging concerning the character and conduct of another It is that divine perfection of which this ruling faculty of the human soul is the image and the offspring that renders  the Lord our judge  He possesses absolute rectitude of nature he not only is pure from all moral evil but he holds it in abomination  he not only is perfect in all moral goodness but he loveth goodness An invariable love of virtue and hatred of vice is necessarily implied in his essential rectitude and it is the first principle of his justice Without this attribute he could neither perceive nor approve his own excellence and with it he cannot but approve favour and be pleased with whatever is right and disapprove condemn and be offended with whatever is wrong in the characters and behaviour of all his reasonable creatures  The Lord God is the holy One of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity  Hab i    Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickdeness neither shall evil dwell with thee the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man  Psal v    I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things I delight saith the Lord  Jer ix    For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright  Psal xi    he delighteth in his way  Psal xxxvii  There are seasons in which every human heart feels and proclaims that there is indelibly impressed upon it a sense that this is the character of God If it were not vain and absurd would be the complaints and the appeals which nature  irresistibly prompts innocence blackened by calumny and integrity overpowered by injury to send up in groans to him who knoweth all things  Holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts  Isa vi  Prejudice and mistake may pervert the judgment of men their conscience may be corrupted and they may  call evil good and good evil  Chap v  Yet fallible as their judgment is to pay it no regard would be unnatural no little fortitude is often requisite for preventing the sensible heart from paying it some regard even when it knows it to be wrong  But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth  Rom ii  by him actions are weighed  Sam ii  His holiness is unerring as his understanding and perfect as his nature its decision can never fail to be ratified and enforced by the full conviction of our own hearts it demands unlimited respect The depravity of men often deadens their moral sentiments both the approbation and the disapprobation of the vicious is slight and languid and it is accounted of little weight The vigour of these sentiments and our deference to them rise in proportion to the worth of the person who expresses them  But there is none holy as the Lord  Sam ii  compared with his immaculate light all created excellence is as darkness  yea the heavens are  not clean in his sight  Job xv    and his angels he chargeth with folly  Chap iv  The strength the intenseness of his approbation and disapprobation who is incapable of passion or emotion we cannot properly conceive to intimate that it is great the sacred writers speak of it in terms borrowed from the most ardent passions and the keenest emotions which the moral qualities of others produce in our souls they represent him as loving delighting and taking pleasure in our goodness and viewing our sins with hatred abhorrence wrath and indignation  THIS omniscient and holy God is our proper and righteous governour This brings his approbation and disapprobation directly home to us it implies that they will be attended with the weightiest consequences it calls forth selflove to support the sense of honour  The Lord is our judge the Lord is our lawgiver the Lord is our king  The judgment of men often reaches only to favourable or unfavourable sentiments of us their esteem is all that we can hope for their blame all that we can incur If they have authority over us if their influence and power can promote or obstruct our interest their opinion of our character assumes a new importance  The wrath  of a king is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is as dew upon the grass  Prov xix  Honour or dishonour in the eye of the allperfect Being are for their own sake deeply affecting to every ingenuous mind but to every soul of man that is not dead to thought they must on account of the infinite moment of their consequences appear to be of infinite importance  The Lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth he reigneth over the nations sitting upon the throne of his holiness  Psal xlvii  God is the sovereign and the moral governour of mankind he will employ omnipotence for the support of his government his approbation will be followed by a great reward his disapprobation by dreadful punishment He observes and estimates our actions not as a spectator but as our ruler when he  searcheth the heart and trieth the reins  it is that he may  judge the righteous and the wicked even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings  Jer x  ii Eccl iii    GOD has formed us the proper subjects of moral laws Both by the dictates of our nature and by the precepts of his word he has prescribed us laws His having prescribed them necessarily implies that he will make a difference  between the obedient and the disobedient The natural sense of good desert in virtue and of ill desert in vice which in every man shews itself in a variety of shapes is an express declaration from him who formed us that he will make the difference He forces us to interpret and receive it as a certain intimation of his designs apprehension of punishment is inseparable from the consciousness of guilt but the reflection that we have done our duty inspires the hope and expectation of reward The state in which God has placed us is adapted to our moral nature it gives scope for our voluntarily obeying or voluntarily transgressing his laws His providence towards us in this state is a plan of government by these laws By the unalterable constitution of things what he requires tends to our peace and joy what he forbids to our disquiet and pain and by the dispositions of his providence they often actually produce these contrary effects Our condition is generally the consequence of our behaviour and frequently it is easy or uneasy according as our behaviour has been moral or immoral Some of the prosperous and the adverse occurrences of life conscience of its own accord constrains every man to consider as marks of God's favour to righteousness and his displeasure against sin  We are verily guilty therefore is this distress  come upon us  Gen xlii  has at times been the unwelcome suggestion of nature to every sinner We feel that we are accountable to God and we have experience that he sometimes calls us to an account That it is but sometimes that often in the present world  there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked  Eccl ix  proceeds only from this that in the present world the plan of God's righteous government is but in its beginning it is no proof that it will not be completed it is a confirmation that it will The beginning of a righteous government infers its progress and its accomplishment its imperfection in the present state proclaims that there will be another state in which it will be perfected it requires it for vindicating the ways of God A state of retribution presupposes an opportunity of trial and the appointment of a season for trial is the pledge of an exact and equal retribution None of the irregularities of the present world neither success in vice nor unsuccessfulness in virtue can erase from the soul of man a conviction of the final justice of God's government there are moments in which the most prosperous wickedness shudders with apprehensions of him  to whom vengeance belongeth  Psal xciv  and oppressed innocence often looks up with confidence to God as its refuge  its avenger and its recompence saying in its trouble  Not for any injustice in mine hands also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on high  Job xvi    Verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth  Psal lviii    THE scripture every where justifies the conviction and unfolds the designs of a perfectly righteous government assuring us that in spite of all the present appearances of disorder  the Lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works  Psal cxlv    For God will bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil  Eccl xii  The dispensation of our redemption by Jesus Christ which displays the marvellous  grace and compassion  of God displays at the same time in the most striking manner the inviolable  sanctity  of his government of mankind While it provides for the pardon of sin the blood of Christ shed for the expiation of sin testifies how odious how deserving of punishment it is in the sight of God While it secures mercy to the penitent it seals the condemnation and the misery of every impenitent sinner It extends reward to the mixt and imperfect virtues of weak men but it extends it only in favour  to the perfect righteousness and sinless obedience of the Son of God The same revelation which informs us of this dispensation of grace teaches us with new light and evidence that this world is the season of our trial and that at the end of it God's favour to righteousness and his wrath against all iniquity will be proclaimed in the face of the whole universe It gives  assurance unto all men that he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness  Acts xvii  that the Son of man unto whom the  judgment is committed by the Father  John v  will come to execute it encompassed with all the glories of heaven  that we must all appear before the judgmentseat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether good or bad  Cor v  and that they who are in that day approved as righteous shall be recompensed with  eternal life  Mat xxv  and happiness but they who are found to be wicked  shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord  Thess i  If then either honour or happiness either disgrace or misery can make an impression on us the judgment of God may make the deepest and the most permanent impression  A CONCEPTION of God as in this manner our allseeing witness necessarily pleased or displeased with us and our absolute and righteous sovereign is the natural principle of a supreme regard to his judgment of our character and conduct If it fail of producing this in creatures susceptible of a sense of character concerned how they appear in the eyes of men often involuntarily touched with the unjust censure or the undeserved praise even of those who possess not their high esteem the conception cannot be lively it cannot be embraced with faith it cannot be entertained with sincerity  SECONDLY Let us now consider in what manner a regard to the judgment of God will operate and exert itself It is not a mere impression on the understanding it is likewise an active motion of the heart It includes a deep sense of the importance of his judgment a supreme value for it an earnest and steady attention to it an habitual solicitude how all our habits and our actions will appear in his sight and a constant care to render them such as will bear his eye God's judgment concerning every one of us is either a judgment of approbation or a judgment of disapprobation Each of these will produce different affections according to the several aspects under which  our opinion of ourselves leads us to view it and all of them the most important and commanding To be approved and beloved or to be disapproved and hated by the ruler of the universe Immense is the distance between these two states To hang in suspence between them to be drawing the lot for the one or the other is a situation fit for agitating the soul with the most vehement emotions and for drawing out all its powers in the most vigorous exertions It is the situation of every human creature in this period of trial Disapprobation from God is the extremity of disgrace and misery approbation from him is the summit of honour and of happiness the former is the natural object of fear sorrow and shame exciting to circumspect avoidance of it the latter of ardent desire elevating hope and rapturous joy conspiring to animate us in the eager pursuit of it Let us briefly unfold these opposite movements of the soul  WHEN we consider God as disapproving all sin a pious regard to his judgment will exert itself in fear sorrow or shame according to the light in which we conceive ourselves to be viewed by him  ANY possible or probable evil is the object of our fear The wrath of that God in whose hand is the soul of every man is the greatest of evils and by wickedness it cannot fail to be provoked in all therefore who are in danger of wickedness it may justly awaken the most awful apprehensions  The Almighty is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice men do therefore fear him  Job xxxvii  The fear of God the dread of disapprobation and punishment from him is the most obvious expression of respect to his judgment It is the native result of the reflection that we are in a state of trial for eternity The very idea of trial implies a possibility of failing and where the issue is so important a bare possibility of failing would be a formidable danger But our danger is far more formidable we are weak we are already lapsed apostates our state abounds with strong temptations to sin it is encumbered with circumstances which render it very difficult to avoid it  Narrow is the way which leadeth unto life  Mat vii  it runs along the edge of an unfathomable precipice it is choaked up by briars and thorns If you have any sense of him  who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work  you cannot but  pass the time of your sojourning here  in fear  Pet i  Every one of us has already gone through some part of his trial and in that part of it every one of us has already failed The impotence of humanity admits not perfect purity  all have  already  sinned  Rom iii      in many things we offend all  Jam iii  we have forfeited the approbation of justice we can have recourse only to the indulgence of mercy The best are conscious of many infirmities many defects and many sins When a tender conscience sets these before their eyes when they place these in the light of God's purity they cannot think without awe what may be the consequences of them under his holy government  how should man be just with God If he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand  Job ix    enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified  Psal cxliii  If their sincerity be so fully ascertained as to cast out the fear of final punishment yet it excludes not the apprehension of rebuke and correction for their faults Though they were also secure from this they could not bear without concern the thought of deserving to be blamed by GodBut when conscience tells the heinous sinner that he has  corrupted all his doings  Zeph iii  that he has chosen those ways which are hateful to God and against which his  fierce anger is denounced what except insensibility can prevent his being alarmed with the terrors of the living God He looks up with consternation to the offended purity and omnipotence of his Judge and with a trembling heart cries out  He hath kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies  Job xix    What then shall I do when he riseth up And when he visiteth what shall I answer him  Chap xxxi  What must I do to be saved  Acts xvi  Roused to an agonizing perception of his danger he deprecates the wrath to which he is obnoxious with anxious importunity  O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger Have mercy upon me O Lord  Psal vi    Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities  Psal li  Such fear of God's displeasure against sin is generally the first motion of the corrupted soul towards him and if it be not violently suppressed or heedlessly dissipated it will work repentance for by repentance alone the displeasure of the holy God can be averted and the forgiveness of sin obtained  FEAR always includes a mixture of sorrow which becomes more intense in proportion to the greatness of the evil and the probability of our incurring it  It is a fearful thing to fall  into the hands of the living God  Heb x  in the apprehension of this sorrow must be the predominant ingredient The miserable consequences of his displeasure are not altogether future though  the wicked be reserved to the day of destruction  Job xxi  for the full punishment of his sins the beginnings of that punishment often tread close on the commission of them  thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy back slidings shall reprove thee  and thou shalt  know and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God  Jer ii  the nearness the imminence of this danger is fit for wringing the heart with grief The displeasure of God is not an evil to which the sinner is only obnoxious he has already incurred it  God is angry with the wicked every day  Psal vii  his wrath is kindled though it has not burnt forth  he hath bent his bow and made it ready  Ver  though  his arrows  have not yet proved  the instruments of death  Ver  In the consciousness of this the sinner who has become sensible of the discriminating eye of perfect sanctity  marking all his paths  Job xxxiii  mourneth for his sins and is troubled His fear is aggravated into sadness and his sadness is ruffled by all  he anxieties of fear His  spirit is broken  his  heart is contrite  Psal li  He  sorrows to repentance  Cor vii  to the reformation of his ways His heartiest repentance his most effectual reformation cannot prevent sorrow from sometimes overcasting his soul it is recalled by every failing it is renewed by every trespass he is grieved that he cannot avoid every action and every thought which is disapproved by his God the sensibility of his spirit makes every imperfection in his temper the object of deep regret  ANY evil can produce fear and sorrow but the disapprobation of God is likewise fit for producing shame and humiliation in every person who is conscious that he has incurred it Whatever we consider as bringing a stain upon our characters naturally excites these sentiments To be detected in what is base confounds the feeling heart though no farther inconvenience be apprehended To be lost to shame is the last stage of degeneracy To deserve blame from God is the deepest ignominy it must cover every man with confusion who has any sense of God When the man who has multiplied his transgressions as the sand is awakened to a just view of what he has done and of what he is when he perceives with anguish that he is odious to God and all his ways abominable in his sight he  lies down  in his shame  Jer iii  he cannot  lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven  he  smites upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner  Luke xviii    O Lord unto me belongeth confusion of face because I have sinned against thee  Dan ix  Not a wicked action of his life not an evil thought of his heart is unknown to the holy Judge of the world they have all been indulged and perpetrated in his very presence They were marked by God when himself was regardless of them they were disapproved by God when himself was unconscious of their baseness and they will at last be published to men and angels He feels himself deserving of  everlasting contempt  Chap xii  How shall he appear How shall he be able to bear his shame He is in his own eyes abased to the dust It is not the heinous sinner alone who is obnoxious to shame in the sense of God as his judge Ingenuity of spirit is always in proportion to virtuous improvement it enables reflection on the smallest sin to overspread the good man's face with secret blushes Even his best services sink him low in his own esteem because they are imperfect Every new failing reiterates his inward abasement every devout thought of its offensiveness to perfect purity revives the impression of his shame  THE fear the sorrow and the humiliation which arise in sinful man from an habitual sense of God's holy government are not confined to those seasons in which serious reflection on ourselves excites remorse The violent emotions unavoidable in these seasons subside gradually into permanent sentiments They dwell upon the spirits of the saints they mix themselves with all their thoughts and actions They make them to proceed through life with unremitted caution to take every step with circumspect attention to exercise steady care in avoiding every transgression and every omission displeasing to God  The fear of the Lord is to hate and to depart from evil  Prov viii    Happy is the man that feareth alway  Prov xxviii Job xxviii  The exertions of the good man are not enervated by timidity but they are guarded by wary concern that they they may be blameless Unsullied by dejection they are all tinged with seriousness remote from meanness they all shew poverty of spirit The sense of his danger banishes arrogance from his heart and the consciousness of his faults hides pride from his eyes  He walks humbly with God  Mic vi  Modesty diffidence lowliness sobermindedness are leading qualities in his temper and render his conduct innocent and pure  A DEVOUT sense that  the Lord is our judge  turning our view to his approbation of virtue will produce ardent desire elevating hope or rapturous joy  HIS approbation is the sublimest honour the rewards which attend it are the purest happiness But what is sinful man that he should dare to look for honour or reward from the God of heaven If his piercing eye should search us with severity or mark all our iniquities the thought even of escaping his displeasure would be blind presumption  What is man that he should be clean And he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous  Job xv  But our God is merciful  he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust  Psal ciii  he maketh gracious allowance for the weakness of our nature By the dispensation of Christ's perfect obedience unto death he hath made provision for granting his acceptance and his favour to the defective virtues of the upright Though  all the world be guilty before God  so that  by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight  yet  through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ God is the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus  Rom iii ▪  with that true faith which  purifieth the heart  Acts xv  and  worketh  by works and by works is made perfect  Jam ii  Whoever is sincere is accounted  worthy  Rev iii    his transgression is forgiven his sin is covered the Lord imputeth not iniquity unto him  Psal xxxii  it is  blotted out from his sight  Jer xviii  Whatever is good in him however weak however mixt with evil is  acceptable to God by Jesus Christ  Pet ii  and will  be found unto praise and honour and glory at his appearing  Chap i    Eternal life  is too great a felicity to be merited by the spotless innocence of any mortal man it is the free  gift of God through Jesus Christ  Rom vi  it is the overflowing of his love to righteousness it is an astonishing display of the exuberant riches of his grace Yet even to it our way is opened by the mediation of his Son it is secured to the obedient by the promise of God who cannot lie  AUTHORIZED by the indulgent dispensation of the gospel to aspire to  praise of God  Cor iv  can we think of it with indifference Can we hear without throbbing hearts the Almighty condescending to proclaim to man  I will set him on high because he hath known my name and I will honour him  Psal xci  If honour from man can engage a wish honour from God may well draw forth all the ardour of the soul Compared with this the applauses of the  whole world and the favour of all its potentates are worthless Ye  receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from God only  John v  is the description of a character of extreme abjectness no less than of abominable wickedness Honour from God solicits our most fervent desires it demands all the efforts of our ambition it is an object worthy of ambition Of the soul that perceives its value the earnest cry will be  Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us  Psal iv  The desire of it will give a direction to our whole conduct It will impel us to  walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work  Col i  it will determine us to  labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him  Cor v  It will give spirit and elevation to all our endeavours to perform  the good and acceptable and perfect will of God  Rom xii  for it sustains them by the prospect of true glory of renown in the complacence love favour and applause of the allperfect Ruler of the universe  THE approbation of God rests not in complacence his favour is inseparably connected with reward By walking so as to please God we shall be in his grace entitled to his peculiar protection to his unerring care for our real  interest in this world and to all that happiness in the next which can proceed from the munificence of him who delights in communicating blessedness Desire of his approbation implies the desire of our own greatest happiness It has sometimes been represented as mean and mercenary to be influenced by this desire But the representation is an absurd affectation of refinement alike inconsistent with the frame of human nature and the doctrine of holy writ Genuine selflove is next to conscience the highest principle of the heart it was placed there on purpose to render us steady in the prosecution of our happiness it is invested with authority to controul all the passions which would attach us to immediate gratifications and advantages destructive of our highest interest which would mislead us into the pursuit of apparent good inconsistent with real felicity If we mistake the nature of human happiness that principle will carry us astray it will disappoint itself and plunge us into misery But when it is directed to those satisfactions which God has annexed to virtue and to those unspeakable joys which he will bestow in approbation of it it is a worthy principle of conduct it is the powerful guardian of integrity it is the certain guide to everlasting pleasures These joys are highly honourable for they are earned by virtue they are  full of  glory  Pet i  for they are the marks of the favour of the King of kings The desire of them shews a soul whose views are enlarged to look beyond the sphere of sense and whose powers have risen superior to all the allurements of the world The scripture is far from blaming the desire of them On the contrary it represents the best men as continually actuated by it as  looking for a city which hath foundations whose builder is God  Heb xi  as  having respect unto the recompence of reward  Ver  as  pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus  Phil iii  And it expressly commands us to  look at the things which are not seen which are eternal  Cor iv  and to  set our affection on things above  Col iii  To inflame the desire it paints the rewards of the righteous in the most glowing colours to support it by hope it gives every assurance that they will be conferred on all who  please God  and  diligently seek him  Heb xi  It proposes it inculcates them as motives to action and if our desire of them bear any proportion to their value they will be powerful motives Desire leads us in every case to that conduct by which its objects may be obtained Desire of reward from God will determine us to perform the conditions on which he has promised it and to acquire the habits which  can qualify us for enjoying it It will determine us to forsake every sin for impenitence in any sin is the forfeiture of heaven It will produce careful application to every duty for the appointment of God is  If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments  Mat xix  It will instigate us to  perfect holiness  Cor vii i  for we must be  like God  to  see him as he is  John iii  It will draw out our activity and inspirit our  labour  by firm confidence that  it is not in vain in the Lord  Cor xv    REGARD to the judgment of God is not completed by desire when the consciousness of our own sincerity warrants our indulging the pleasant thought that ourselves are approved of him the happy objects of his favour the heirs of immortal glory it breaks forth into triumphant hope and joy This sublimest hope this purest of joys is not hid even from mortal man  Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God  Rom v  Neither the remembrance of the  sins that are past  Chap iii  nor the sense of many remaining stains and failings can exclude the sincere Christian from this exalted privilege for the remission of these the clemency of the new covenant has made full provision The faintest  sense of our acceptance with God though shaded by diffidence and doubt is a ground of serenity of soul But when by  the spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ  Chap viii  we can  assure our hearts before him  John iii  it is  the peace of God which passeth all understanding  Phil iv    The hope of the righteous is gladness  Prov x  Joy is always one element in the composition of hope and it predominates in proportion to our opinion of the greatness and the certainty of the good hoped for Religious hope is the firm expectation of our supreme dignity and happiness It includes not only expectation of the future enjoyment of God but experience also of his present favour It establishes in the soul a temper of the most unclouded cheerfulness it elevates it at times into triumph and rapture It fans an inextinguishable flame of gratitude and sends it upwards in  high praises to God  Psal cxlix  who  hath made  him  accepted in the beloved  Eph i    Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin  Psal lxxxv    Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased  Psal iv  The allpenetrating eye of God so terrible to the sinner is become to the  man who feels himself approved in his sight the exhilarating the encouraging eye of his friend and his father He is no longer  troubled at his presence  Job xxiii  the sense of it is his chiefest joy it is his consolation in every gloomy hour  He knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold  Ver  Thou wilt  bring forth  my  righteousness as the light and  my  judgment as the noonday  Psal xxxvii  His hope not only prompts to activity but inspires alacrity in serving God it  enlarges his heart  to  run the way of his commandments  Psal cxix  it enables him to go on not with diligence only but with rejoicing it renders the hardest labour easy and the greatest efforts pleasing It secures his unremitted perseverance that he may  hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of hope firm unto the end  Heb iii  having tasted how sweet it is the thought of forfeiting it by inconstancy or defection would be anguish to his soul His hope and his joy brighten in proportion to his progress they dispel the shadows of  the valley of death  Psal xxiii  they illuminate the  land of darkness itself  Job x  they strengthen his heart to cry out with exultation  I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me henceforth there is laid up for me a  crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day  Tim iv    SUCH are the native exertions of a pious regard to the judgment of God According to the different situations of our own hearts it will produce fear of displeasure and punishment from him or sorrow and shame in the reflection that we have deserved it desire of approbation and reward or hope and joy in the thought that we are entitled to it These unite their energies in the checquered temper of the good man and mitigate and qualify one another Amidst all the faults of our nature all the imperfections of our temper and all the deviations of our conduct desire and hope prevent our fears from degenerating into terror and despair and our sorrow and humiliation from sinking us into dejection and despondence and amidst our most satisfying reflections and our sublimest prospects the sense of our danger and the consciousness of our innumerable failings restrains our hope from becoming presumptuous and our joy from elating or throwing us off our guard Derived from the same fountain they again mix their streams and run forward in one even current They form a temper in which  sedateness and ardour gravity and cheerfulness circumspection and spirit caution and confidence are happily blended together It is at once a barrier against heedlessness and levity and an incitement to activity and enterprise It is alike remote from the horrors of superstition and the swellings of enthusiasm  ALL the parts of this temper have the very same tendency they impel us with their complicated force to avoid every vice for every vice is displeasing to God and inconsistent with his favour and to practise every virtue for every virtue is pleasing to him and will be rewarded by him If this temper be real it will be powerful if it exist it will be a ruling and leading principle its influence will be discernible in the whole tenour of our behaviour every act of vice every neglect of duty proclaims some defect in our recollection that  the Lord is our judge  A lively sense of this will make us as solicitous for the innocence of our most secret actions as for the blamelessness of those which are most open To be exempt from the observation and the censure of men is nothing  behold I have seen it saith the Lord  Jer vii  and  I will recompence it  Heb x    the darkness hideth not from  him  but the night  shineth as the day  Psal cxxxix  It will render us as attentive to the purity of our thoughts as to the decency of our behaviour they are alike exposed to the judgment of God It will be the preservative of sincerity it will secure the conformity of our intentions to our professions and of our principles to our actions it will force us to feel that hypocrisy is foolishness by it ye may  justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts  Luke xvi  he  seeth not as man seeth he looketh  not  on the outward appearance but on the heart  Sam xvi  and when  the Lord shall come he will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts  Cor iv  Awed by this conviction  till I die I will not remove my integrity from me my righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when God taketh away his soul  Job xxvii    A PREVAILING regard to the judgment of God is the most effectual antidote against infection from the erroneous opinions of men concerning good and evil Desirous as we naturally are of avoiding their censure and obtaining their esteem both whenever they  are misplaced will appear despicable to the man who is possessed of that regard Corrupt fashion presuming to authorize what God disapproves or to explode what he approves will be accounted but the silly caprice of fools Attempts to palliate or justify any thing that is immoral or to throw ridicule on any thing that belongs to virtue will be neglected as no better than the ravings of insanity Wherever the misjudgings of erring mortals run counter to the estimation of the infallible arbiter of right and wrong they will be slighted and derided If every sensible man prefers the esteem of a few able judges to the applauses of an ignorant multitude he must be as destitute of good sense as of religion who can hesitate in preferring honour from God to the good opinion of the whole universe  With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of man's judgment but he that judgeth me is the Lord  Cor iv  Every expectation every apprehension that can be entertained in consequence of the good or the ill opinion of men vanishes at the thought of what will result from our being acquitted or condemned by God  They can only kill the body be not afraid of them but fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell  Luke xii  Their smiles are often deceitful always  insignificant but  in his favour is life  Psal xxx    his lovingkindness is better than life  Psal lxiii    ALL the present pleasures and advantages which sin can offer will be unable to seduce the man who preserves a lively sense of the heavenly Judge for they bear no proportion either to the happiness which accompanies his approbation or to the misery which arises from his wrath  For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works  Mat xvi  All the losses troubles and perils to which virtue can expose him will not have power enough to terrify him from the love and practice of it for  the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us  Rom viii  Convinced that  no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them  Eccl ix  looking beyond the inequalities of the state of trial fixing his eye on the perfect display of God's impartial righteousness which is to take place in the eternal state of recompence he will in every situation  do good and wait patiently for the Lord  Psal xxxvi      not j  ing  himself in anywise to do evil  Psal xxxvii  nor suffering himself to say  I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency  Psal lxxiii  Conscious that he is observed by God animated by the sense of his acting his part before so august a presence he will exert all the powers of his soul to act it well In the exertion he will feel a noble expansion of heart and triumph in the hope of being approved and rewarded and his hope shall not be disappointed its largest promises shall be surpassed by the greatness of his reward  SERMON IX THE CONFIDENCE OF THE RIGHTEOUS AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT  JOHN ii  And now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming  THAT the belief of the future judgment may the more effectually influence our conduct the scriptures represent it as a solemn process attended with many sensible circumstances easily and strongly apprehensible That it may give motion to all our springs of action they place it in a great variety of lights Sometimes they describe it as a tremendous event fit to alarm our fears and to enforce anxious vigilance and circumspection At other times they set it forth as what good men have reason to  love  Tim iv  as  the day of their redemption  Eph iv    the commencement of their eternal  life the prospect of which may comfort them amidst their present sorrows dispel all temporary fears and produce alacrity and cheerfulness in virtuous practice It is in this light that my text has placed it John with an authority to which he was entitled both as an apostle and as an old man and with a tenderness of affection for which he was remarkable addressing Christians by the appellation of  little children  and exhorting them to  abide in Christ  to continue stedfast in the faith and practice of his religion enforces the exhortation by this argument  that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming  It is a very persuasive argument The coming of the Son of God to judgment is the terror of wicked men they avoid the very thought of it as insupportable and in the hour of judgment their shame and confusion their anguish and misery will surpass all that their terror had foreboded Even good men cannot always look forward to it without painful concern The possibility of their not being fully prepared for a trial the consequences of which are everlasting must at times excite some apprehensions in those who are conscious of many imperfections To be able to  look for the coming of the day of God  Pet iii  with entire tranquillity  to be qualified for welcoming its solemnities with firmness and intrepidity and for standing before the Lord the righteous Judge with boldness and joyful confidence that he will acquit us and put us in possession of all the joys of heaven how invaluable is the privilege By inviolable sincerity and persevering diligence in universal holiness it may be certainly attained  IT is this alluring this animating motive to Christian virtue that I now propose to inculcate on you I propose to evince that the stedfast practice of it will give you assurance and joy at Christ's awful appearance to judge the world In prosecution of this design I would lead you to observe  FIRST That Christian virtue naturally produces these effects in this world and  SECONDLY That the intention and the circumstances of Christ's appearance will secure its then producing them in an higher degree  FIRST That Christian virtue will inspire confidence and joy at the coming of Christ to judgment we may fairly conclude from its  naturally producing these effects in the present world  THIS will not require a laboured proof its evidence lies within yourselves for perceiving it you need only attend to what passes in your own hearts when you reflect upon your conduct You have experience that conscience sometimes approves and sometimes disapproves you and you cannot but be sensible that both its approbation and its disapprobation imply an anticipation a presentiment of the consequences of your actions as well as a judgment concerning their nature Its disapprobation includes not only regret and sorrow for our having done amiss but apprehension also that we shall suffer for it Its approbation includes not only pleasure in the conviction that we have done right but a sense that we deserve well by what we have done and hope that it will contribute something to our happiness Fearfulness is so essential to an evil conscience and confidence to a good conscience that by them the wise man characterizes the vicious and the virtuous  The wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion  Prov xxviii  Along with satisfaction in reviewing the past a good conscience begets tranquillity in the prospect of the future  It gives a sense of security it infuses hope often even assurance that it shall be well with us This is a part of that peace of mind which it establishes this forms one distinction between it and every other joy and to a reasonable creature prone to look forward inevitably solicitous about what shall befal him hereafter this renders a good conscience the most important of all joys  HOPE springs so naturally from consciousness of virtue that a single good action produces some degree of it though we know ourselves to be very faulty in other particulars We reckon ourselves secure at least as to the consequences of that action If it meet with praise if it bring us honour or advantage we accept them as our right if it be misconstrued and censured we are disappointed we feel with indignation that we are injured and hug ourselves in the sense of our integrity It cherishes good hope not only towards men but also towards God it leads us to expect his blessing on it The expectation is so natural that bad consequences proceeding from a wellintended and worthy action have sometimes surprized even religious persons into a momentary arraignment of the justice of Divine Providence It is so natural that it enables the man whose good deeds are traduced or repaid with evil to appeal  to God for their rectitude and fearlessly to plead that he will vindicate them In relation to the particular crimes with which David was falsely charged by his enemies he often addresses God in words which seem to befit only innocence  Hear the right O Lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal thou hast proved mine heart thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing  Psal xvii    Judge me O Lord for I have walked in mine integrity examine me O Lord and prove me try my reins and my heart I will wash mine hands in innocency so will I compass thine altar O Lord  Psal xxvi  Of the like confidence towards God dictated by the consciousness of integrity in some particular instance of calumniated behaviour we find examples every day We have all experienced it in ourselves It is not confined to the uniformly virtuous  BUT the consciousness of uniform virtue of genuine and habitual holiness produces a boldness and confidence of a more enlarged and important nature A particular good action can give confidence only in respect of its proper consequences but universal and persevering  goodness begets a sense of security in respect of the final result of our whole behaviour It inspires and it sustains the blessed hope of a state of pure and permanent happiness By the favour of him who made us this glorious privilege is annexed to the upright obedience of his will By his appointment in the moment of our creation  the work of righteousness is peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever  Isa xxii  Sinless obedience would produce full and uninterrupted assurance of happiness But in every human breast the sense of innumerable failings and of some heinous offences raises doubts and apprehensions which often break the fulness of assurance Yet so great is the power of virtue that the testimony of conscience for the habitual sincerity of our hearts can generally dispel our fears and support our expectation of approbation and reward from God notwithstanding the multitude of our imperfections Encouraged by that testimony we no longer tremble at the rigour of inexorable justice we look up to the indulgence of divine mercy with humble confidence  IT is only we must confess the dispensation of redemption by Jesus Christ that lays a  sure foundation for a guilty creature's confidence in God it alone can render his trust rational and consistent it alone can warrant the sons of men to aspire to so transcendent an happiness as that of heaven Yet so congenial is this confidence and trust to the virtuous soul that even into those who were wholly ignorant of that dispensation a good conscience has always infused the hope of a future happiness and of an happiness greater than can be found on earth The best of the heathens pleased themselves with the expectation of living after death in the society of all the great and good men of former ages It was nature itself that raised the expectation the God of nature authorized it The dispensation of redemption was decreed by him before the world began he had it in his eye when he created man he adapted human nature to the whole of that state for which he designed human creatures he framed its constitution with a reference to the secret intentions of his grace He therefore impowered conscience to suggest to all good men hopes which are unaccountable to mere reason which can be justified only by the revelation of a merciful dispensation rendering repentance available to the forgiveness of sins and entitling our imperfect and unprofitable service  to the reward of perfect and endless happiness  TO us Christians this revelation is vouchsafed By it we are assured that God has already reconciled the world to himself by Jesus Christ that by his sacrifice the pardon of sin is obtained for every penitent that by the merit of his obedience unto death the inconceivable glory of heaven is purchased for all who sincerely obey the gospel that he has already entered into heaven to  make intercession for us  Rom viii  and as  our forerunner  Heb vi    to prepare a place for us  John xiv  This revelation resolves the doubts of nature confirms its hopes and brightens its prospects Enlightened by it a good conscience exerts itself with unimpaired force The Christian's hope is enlivened and invigorated by faith  Having his heart sprinkled from an evil conscience  he can look up to God  in full assurance of faith  Heb x  he can rejoice in stedfast hope that he shall enjoy the divine protection and favour in this world and that when he is called to his great account hereafter he shall be acquitted from his sins  saved from wrath  Rom v  and blessed with everlasting happiness  Beloved if our heart condemn us not  then have we confidence toward God  John iii  Our confidence is built upon promises numerous and explicit It is strengthened by the t  timony of the Holy Spirit  which is the  of our inheritance  Eph i  Of Christian virtu  therefore  everlasting consolation and good  through grace  Thess ii  are the native fruitsIf the sense of many defects and frequent lapses hinders some who are habitually sincere from reaping these fruits it can be imputed only to their defections and their sins completer and more consistent virtue would have secured their peace of mind If a melancholy and timid temper or mistakes concerning the terms of the Christian salvation overcast their souls with a causeless gloom it is only an accidental cloud intercepting for a season the light and comfort to which their virtue gives them a right  MOST of our joys are transient and most of our hopes fallacious they wither in the day of trouble they vanish in the hour of death But the joy and the hope of a good conscience are permanent Far from being blasted by affliction they often draw nutriment from it and flourish in unwonted freshness when sorrows most abound By the pressure  of adversity the good man becomes recollected in himself his spirit is roused within him his fortitude is called forth  A conscience void of essence toward God and toward man  Acts xxiv  is his only remaining refuge he finds it a source of unusual intrepidity he derives from it a firmness of hope and a fullness of joy which he never knew before Even  in his death the righteous hath hope  Prov xiv  At the approach of death his hope often becomes more lively the doubts which at times perplexed him disappear the sins which often alarmed his fears he perceives to be relinquished and pardoned the infirmities for which he often mourned he sees to be compassionable Eternity looks less formidable in proportion as it is viewed nearer and discerned more clearly He feels himself by grace entitled to that  eternal life  which  is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord  Rom vi  Without anxiety or dread he is able to  com  t the k  eping of his soul to God  Pet iv  He resigns it in calm confidence that he shall be raised again to immortal happiness  THUS stedfast virtue is necessarily attended by a good conscience and a good conscience  necessarily inspires hope boldness and confidence towards God If these be the present consequences of a virtuous course how can we entertain a doubt that it will likewise produce the blessed consequence by which the Apostle recommends it in the text If these accompany the good man through life and forsake him not in the dark hour of death why should they desert him in the bright morning of the resurrection If they have strength enough to endure all the storms which beat upon them in this world of turbulence why should they die away when they are transplanted into the regions of serenity which are exempt from every storm If faith in Christ  unseen  can now preserve them is it possible that they should be extinguished when our eyes shall  see  him on whom we have believed coming in his glory Shall that hope which supported itself when it was deferred begin to languish when it is just ready to be fulfilled It cannot fail on the contrary to rise into firm assurance and undisturbed joy  FOR completing the proof of this we proposed SECONDLY to shew that the design and the circumstances of Christ's appearance are such as must increase the boldness and confidence of all who have been sincerely and habitually holyCan it then be that they  will not rather destroy it Is not  the day of the Lord great and very terrible And who can abide it  Joel ii  Very terrible it will be to the wicked but to the righteous it will be comfortable It is common for the same object to produce contrary effects on contrary tempers Let us in thought transport ourselves for a little to the judgment of the last dayThe Scripture has in part revealed its solemnities let us consider how they may naturally be expected to affect the man whose temper and conduct have through life cherished good hope towards God Awful and striking they doubtless are the faintest conception of them will give us a feeling sense of the importance of that intrepidity which through their progress the righteous alone will be able to preserve but the fullest detail of them could not raise a suspicion that they will break the firmness of the virtuous soul  ALL the preparations for the judgment of the world will be awful When  signs shall be seen in the sun and in the moon and in the stars  when  the sea and the waves  shall  roar  when  the powers of heaven shall be shaken  when  the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven  who among all that  are alive and remain unto  the coming of the Lord  can stand undismayed There will be  upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity all the tribes and kindreds of the earth mourning and wailing men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth  Luke xxi Mat xxiv Thess iv Rev i  But from this consternation the righteous of every tribe and kindred and nation are exempt Their wonder is without amazement their awe is void of terror and their expectation of anxiety  When these things begin to come to pass they look up and lift up their heads for  they know that  their redemption draweth nigh  Luke xxi  The convulsions of nature which they behold around them are the appointed preludes to its completion and their greatness only indicates the immensity of its value  WHILE the living see these signs the dead shall hear  the trump of God and the voice of the Archangel  Thess iv  commanding them to arise It tumbles down the vaulted sepulchres it rends the foundations of the mountains it shakes the depths of the ocean but it shakes not the soul of the righteous nor disturbs his thoughts The moment it reaches his ear he knows it to be the call to immortality the moment he awakes from the grave he finds himself partaker  of  the resurrection of the just  Luke xiv  If the light of the morning is cheering to man the dawning of eternal day must be transporting The joy of a prisoner released from the dungeon in which he has been long confined is faint in comparison of their joy who by the opening of the grave have now  obtained the  everlasting  redemption of their body  Rom viii  A resurrection unto life has always been  the hope  and the  comfort  of the Christian  A  iii Thess iv  when the hope is now accomplished when he has already  attained unto the resurrection of the dead  Phil iii  it must be unmixed joy At death  the spirits of just men  are  made perfect  Heb xii  and rising at the last day conscious of their being perfect they cannot but be certain that they  shall not come into condemnation  but have  come forth unto everlasting life  John v  Their very senses assure them that they are  the children of the resurrection  who  cannot die any more  Luke xx  for they inform them that they bear no longer  the image of the earthy  but  the image of the heavenly  Cor xv  They see with their eyes they feel through their whole frame that their bodies are raised  spiritual in incorruption in glory in power  Ver    In a moment  too  in the twinkling of an eye at  the last trump  the living who had not fallen asleep  shall be changed this corruptible putting on incorruption and this mortal immortality  Cor xv  The quick and the dead together experience in themselves  mortality swallowed up of life  Cor v  Christ hath already  changed their vile body  it is  fashioned like unto his own glorious body  Phil iii  With what ineffable rapture will they then enter into the full sense of that triumph which the Apostle has expressed as strongly as the feebleness of mortal language can admit  Death is swallowed up in victory O death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victory Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ  Cor xv  Every thing is gone which could check or abate their triumph The avocations of sense cannot for a moment divert the consciousness of their purity the objects of sense cannot impress a feeling of uneasiness to damp their joy in that consciousness They have now no mortal part from which vapours can rise to involve their hearts in heavinessImperfect conceptions of God or of themselves cannot now mislead them into doubt or distract them with gloomy apprehensions the knowledge which was  in part is done away that which is perfect is come  Chap xiii  No possibility of future perils or temptations can infuse  the least grain of diffidence to adulterate their gladness every danger is surmounted temptation is annihilated their trial is finished  the last enemy death is destroyed  Cor xv  Their confidence is the security consequent on a victory already gained their joy is the triumphant exultation of the conqueror The humble and timid Christian whose evening was overcast with clouds who could not resign his spirit without solicitude and trembling awakes in sunshine filled with gladness rapt into extasy The stedfast Christian who was even in his earthly state delivered from  the spirit of fear  Tim i  who lived and who died  rejoicing in hope of the glory of God  Rom v  forgets all his former peace in the exuberance of delight which now flows in upon him Not with the firmest persuasion of faith or  the fullest assurance of hope  Heb vi  but with the infallible certainty of experience they cry out  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ In all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us  Rom viii    AROUND them they behold the multitudes of men innumerable who have peopled all the regions of the earth from the creation to the last day Of these many have  awaked to shame and everlasting contempt  Dan xii  The haggard  form of the wicked the confusion of their faces the trembling of their joints proclaim that they have  come forth unto the resurrection of damnation  John v  Were the righteous man accessible to fear for himself the sight of the wicked would instantly banish it his whole figure is a contrast to theirs their visible despondence of which he bears no mark confirms his confidence their desperation proves the importance of his own security and elevates his joy in itHe finds himself in a great company of saints they differ  as one star differeth from another star in glory  Cor xv  but in glory they all appear They wear robes of immortality resembling his own like himself they look up with confidence and are not ashamed He mingles in  the general assembly of the firstborn  Heb xii  he congratulates and is congratulated by them they recognize each other as kindred spirits companions in tribulation and in patience fellowlabourers and fellowconquerors compatriots of the kingdom of heaven By associating together by the mutual contagion of heartfelt sentiments they are more emboldened their confidence invigorated and their joy exalted  THEN  shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory  Mat xxiv Mark xiii Luke xxi  But they shall see him without fear It is the Son of man The Judge of the world comes in human nature a pledge of his mildness and equity in judging human creatures a token that he  can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities  for in that nature he was in all points  tempted like as we are  Heb iv  an intimation that he acknowledges his relation to them a cheering an elevating evidence that  he is not ashamed to call them brethren  Chap ii  an assurance that he will present them to his Father saying  Behold I and the children which God hath given me  Ver  It is he who came in abasement to redeem the world It is he who died that he might become the Saviour of the obedient It is he who has already expiated all their failings by his blood After his resurrection it is certain that his  hands  bore  the print of the nails  and his  side  the mark of the spear  John xx  by which his blood was shed and probably his body will retain these signatures of his philanthropy and grace when he returns to judge the world He has always been for true Christians  an advocate with the Father  John ii  He cannot  but make the most gracious allowances for all their imperfections Before this merciful Judge how should they who through life studied to abide in him but have confidence and boldness Instead of shrinking from his presence they welcome him with shouts  Lo this is our Lord we have waited for him and he will save us we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation  Isa xxv    LET the wicked tremble at his coming to the righteous the purpose of his coming is the most exhilarating He who  was once offered to bear the fins of many  now  unto them that look for him appears the second time without sin unto salvation  Heb ix  He appears on purpose to dispense the mercy of God to all who have accepted it He appears to display the munificence of God to all who have served him in sincerity This is the time to which good men always looked forward by faith with earnest expectation for the accomplishment of the  precious promises  Pet i  of the gospel This is the time of which Jesus said  I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also  John xiv    Behold I come quickly and my reward is with me  Rev xxii  Assuredly conscious that they have adhered to  the terms of God's salvation and are entitled to the great reward their joy is full The faith by which they were wont to eye it is improved into sight The hour is come in which they are to  receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away  Pet v  they perceive it ready with alacrity they stretch out their hand to take hold of it  SUCH being the Judge and such to them the purpose of his coming the  glory and power  with which he comes cannot possibly abash them On the contrary these encourage their confidence and exultation They are the ensigns of his majesty who is their patron and their friend they are the badges of his authority to seal their salvation they are the evidences of his power to bless them They add spirit to their boldness and rapture to their gladness The splendour the treasures and the forces of a sovereign terrifying to his enemies are in prop  tion to their greatness the protection  the boast of his loyal subjects  shall be the glory of the Son of man at his appearing  He shall come in his own glory  Luke ix  The majesty of his person is awful but only guilt unforgiven can render it tremendous The righteous delivered from the guilt of all their sins can contemplate  it without confusion They contemplate it with deep veneration but their veneration has no mixture of pain or dread it is like the solemn reverence of the happy spirits who surround the throne of God and  always behold his face  Mat xviii  replete with sedate and placid enjoyment The glory of the Son of man is magnificent viewed without terror it can only exalt and expand the soul It is the dignity of perfect excellence it gratifies the noblest faculties with the sublimest of delights It is the effulgence of divine benignity ravishing to the heart The word of truth has assured us that  in that day the Lord shall be glorified in his Saints and admired in all them that have believed  Thess i  To them  his eyes  brighter than  a flame of fire  confounding to the sinner as the flashes of lightning beam mildness and condescension To them  his countenance as the sun shining in his strength  is not dazzling but splendid and cheering To them  his voice  loud  as the sound of many waters  Rev i  is only grand and elevating To them the glories of his person are animating and transporting not only as being the security but also as being the exemplar of their own immortal gloryFor he has promised to them  that when he shall  appear they shall be like him  John iii  that they shall be  glorified together  Rom viii  with him that  the glory which his Father gave him he will give them  John xvii  Astonished with the brightness of his glory how must they triumph in the thought of being quickly cloathed with the like glory  HE shall come  in his Father's glory  Mat xvi Mark viii Luke ix  not only invested with his authority but attended by his Shechinah the token of his immediate presence It was always the pledge of his kindness to his people when  it filled his house they praised the Lord saying For he is good for his mercy endureth for ever  Chron vii  It is now the evidence of the completion of his kindness It is the assurance that henceforth  the tabernacle of God is with men and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them and God himself shall be their God  Rev ix xxi    HE shall come  with all the holy angels  Mat xvi xxv Mark viii Luke ix    an innumerable company  Heb xii  a glorious retinue of mighty spirits At the sight of one of them man in his mortal state has oftener than once been terrified but  the children of the resurrection  feel themselves  equal to the angels  Luke xx    They behold them with pleasure attending their Lord to contribute to his glory They know that he has brought them with him on purpose to subserve their own advancement to  minister for the heirs of salvation  Heb i  to GATHER  them together from one end of heaven to the other  Mat xxiv  to  severe them from among the wicked  that they may  shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father  Chap xiii    UNAPPALLED they shall see the Judge  sit upon the throne of his glory  Chap xxv  and all nations assembled at the judgmentseat Even rejoicing they shall stand before it It is the tribunal to which they were always accustomed to appeal from the injustice of men it is the tribunal from which they constantly expected the reward of all their labours ample compensation for all their sorrows the sentence which was to fix them immutably in perfect happiness It is now erected Their assurance is confirmed their joy rises as they approach to it To them it is  the throne of grace  Heb iv  The tranquillity of their reflections makes them certain that they shall  be found in peace without spot and blameless  Pet iii  When  the judgment is set and the books opened  Dan vii  all the procedure supports  and augments their boldness When they meet the eye of the Judge it smiles upon them with complacence and darts new rays of gladness into their souls He judges his  people with equity  Psal xcviii    In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me  Mat xxv  is his indulgent construction of their good actions Their frailties are excused by his clemency  who remembereth that they were dust  Psal    Their sins are mercifully covered they were forsaken and they are no more imputed to them Partakers of  the redemption which is in Christ  Rom iii  they are in the gracious acceptance of the Judge  holy and without blemish and unreproveable in his sight  Eph v Col  They  are found written in the book of life  Rev xx  They are  caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air  Thess iv  They are  set on his right hand  M xxv  Sentence is pronounced in their favour It is proclaimed through the universe that they are justified approved and glorified The King places them  with him on his throne  Rev iii  He authorizes them with him to  judge the world  and the  angels  Cor vi  The dimness of the most assured faith the feebleness of the most established hope is now no more it is superseded by the clearness of vision and the fulness  of fruition Their whole frame is joy rapture triumph  WHAT though nature be all in flames  the elements melting with fervent heat the heavens on fire passing away with a great noise the earth and the works that are therein burnt up  Pet iii  The conflagration cannot excite either a fear or a sorrow in their happy souls The saints when sustained only by faith in God invisible had such a superiority to the most frightful commotions of nature which themselves too might  be involved  in and suffer from as enabled them to say  God is our refuge and strength therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof  Psal xlvi  How perfect then will their superiority be to the final convulsions of nature when they shall see God and when they shall know that the wreck of worlds can give no disappointment to their desires no disturbance to their peace They behold it not only unconcerned but exulting They know that the things which have been are now dissolved only that from their ruins refined by fire there may arise according to God's promise  new heavens  and a new earth wherein dwelleth rightcousness  Pet iii    He that sitteth upon the throne saith Behold I make all things new  Rev xxi  The glorious edifice rises at his word It is  the holy city  Ver  of the great God the spacious mansion of eternal delight The righteous enter into it and there live and  reign  in glory and joys inconceivable  for ever and ever  Chap xxii    THUSboth from the hope which accompanies the consciousness of virtue in the present lifeand from the fitness of all the circumstances of the judgment to raise the hope of the virtuous into assurance and convert it into triumphit is evident that if by the diligent practice of all virtue we  abide in Christ we shall have confidence when he shall appear and not be ashamed before him at his coming  Can there be a more blessed prospect Can there be a stronger incentive to indefatigable diligence and undeviating constancy in Christian virtue By this conduct alone it is attainable In the present world▪ in this land of darkness and deceitfulness the wicked may flatter and solace themselves with delusive hopes of mercy and favour from God but these will vanish as the dreams of the night at the approach of the eternal day In this world the false confidence of the hypocrite  the daring boldness of the enthusiast the blind presumption of the thoughtless sinner may rival or even outshine the humility of Christian hope but in the day of wrath they shall perish it alone shall continue and increase In this world religion has its joys the purest the most satisfying that belong to the lot of mortal man They are small in comparison with those which await good men when they shall be raised to immortality they are but like the earliest dawn in comparison with the meridian light but as the dawn presages the perfect day they are earnests of those exalted joys If we act in such a manner as to secure present  rejoicing in the testimony of our conscience  Cor i  we shall likewise be able to rejoice in the great day of the Lord Undaunted we shall hear the sound of  the last trump  Cor xv  With gladness we shall perceive that we are  not found naked but cloathed  Cor v  with incorruptible bodies Undazzled our eyes shall see  the Son of man coming in his glory  Mat xxv  his majesty shall be the confirmation of our hopes Intrepid we shall stand before his judgmentseat undergo our trial and wait for our sentence Enraptured we shall hear the sentence of approbation pronounced in our favour Consciously secure we shall look on the fall of dissolving worlds We  shall see a more stupendous fabric raised We shall be received into it and be for  ever with the Lord  Thess iv    IF we would keep this glorious prospect continually in our eye it could not fail to determine us to that holy conduct by which alone it can be realized to us No temptation could have art or strength enough to defeat its influence The most fascinating pleasures of sin could not entice us if in the moment of their solicitation we reflected that by venturing to taste them we shall forfeit our confidence and be covered with shame in the important day when  every one of us shall give account of himself to God  Rom xiv  No danger no difficulty no loss no suffering could deter us from our duty if in the moment of its assault we preserved a lively sense that every danger which we bravely face every difficulty which we strenuously combat every loss which we resolutely incur every pain which we patiently endure rather than neglect what is good or do what is evil will add a wreath to our  crown of rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming  Thess ii  With whatever violence corrupt appetites and passions rage within us we would reckon no selfdenial too severe no labour too  hard no vigilance too intense no perseverance too fatiguing in order to subdue and mortify them if we maintained a permanent conviction that every ungoverned propensity is  a  of bitterness springing up to trouble us  Heb xii  that we must conquer before our tranquillity can be established that we can triumph only in consequence of a victory  WHETHER the remembrance of gross transgressions or seeble wavering will impair the confidence and debase the joy of those who are upright on the whole while they are rendering their account and expecting their sentence I presume not to determine But certain it is that it disturbs their present peace enervates their hope overwhelms them with sorrow fills them with melancholy thoughts and often occasions their meeting death with terror and dejection and leaving this world with perplexing doubts or despondence concerning their eternal state And certain it likewise is that inconstancy or heinous offences will lessen their happiness in heaven  He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly  Cor ix    The nobleman advanced his servants  in exact proportion to what each had  gained by his pound  Luke xix  To be unstable in holiness to be often starting aside  into faulty actions even though we again recover ourselves by repentance comes not up to the full import of  abiding in Christ  nor can be expected completely to ascertain our right to the glorious privileges which attend it If we would be sure to  give account with joy  Heb xiii  we must study to render our virtue pure our goodness uniform our obedience persevering our improvement continually progressiveThen shall  the Lord stablish our hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints  Thess iii  Wherefore  we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not shaken  Thess ii    nor fall from your own stedfastness but grow in grace  Pet iii    NOW  unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy be glory and majesty

future judgment is in many respects awful to all men and dreadful to the wicked But no circumstance renders it more dreadful to them than this That in the day of judgment they shall be self condemned To be selfcondemned is exquisitely painful The wicked sometimes feel the torment of it in this world they are always exposed to it and when they shall be called to judgment they cannot possibly escape it This reflection binds down upon the guilty soul all the terrors of that tremendous season and must be a powerful motive to that repentance and reformation which will deliver us from the agonies  of guilt The text naturally suggests it to our thoughts It is part of a parable spoken by our Saviour Alluding to the state of Judea at that time a Roman province parts of which were bestowed by the emperours on tributary princes he represents a nobleman going into a far country to receive a kingdom calling his servants together before his departure giving each of them a piece of money to improve during his absence returning after having received the kingdom calling them to an account for the money which he had entrusted to them applauding those who had improved it and rewarding them in proportion to the degree of their improvement but condemning one who had hid the money in a napkin first  judging him out of his own mouth  and then commanding him to be punished The meaning of the parable is this Our Lord Jesus Christ who has ascended into heaven to receive from his Father the kingdom and dominion over all and has left his followers to improve the advantages which they enjoy by their reasonable and moral nature and by revelation will return at the end of the world will call them and all mankind before his judgmentseat will munificently reward his faithful servants according to their deserts but will force the wicked to condemn themselves out of their own mouths their  conscience accusing them anticipating their sentence and bearing witness to its justice By seriously reflecting on this misery at present we may avoid it we may be excited to forsake those sins which will produce it and in the diligent practice of holiness obtain in its stead the approbation of our own minds brightening the solemnity of the judgment into gladness and assuring us of everlasting happiness as the issue of our trial May this be the effect as it is the sincere design of the reflections which we propose to offer on the confusion and anguish which at the coming of the Son of God to judgment all the wicked shall endure in being selfcondemned That these reflections may by the grace of God produce conviction I shall shew  FIRST That by the state of their minds in this world the wicked are prepared for being selfcondemned and enduring all the horrors of guilt in the day of judgment and  SECONDLY That the nature and circumstances of the judgment will awaken the sense of guilt and raise the anguish of their selfcondemnation to extremity  FIRST To be convinced that wicked men cannot escape selfcondemnation at the day of  judgment we need only consider what is the state of their minds in the present world It cannot be better illustrated than by the account which the wicked servant censured in this parable gives of himself  Lord behold here is thy pound which I have kept laid up in a napkin for I feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou laidst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow  His plea confutes itself His conduct was the reverse of what his professed opinion of his master's character naturally dictated He knew that his lord would demand more than he had lent him yet by laying it up unemployed he rendered it impossible that he could return him more Palpable as the inconsistence was he never attended to it during the absence of his lord but he instantly convicted him by the very justification which he offered and caused him feel that he had already condemned his own practice by his avowed sentiments  Thou knowest that I austere man taking up that I laid not down and reaping that I did not sow wherefore then gavest thou not my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required my own with usury  The question was unanswerable he was silenced and confounded Perfectly similar is the condition of the wicked Their practice is contradictory though often they perceive it not to their nature to their  principles to what they are to what they believe to what they profess and is condemned by all these  EVERY man has conscience in his breast to point out his duty to command him to perform it and to reprove him when he transgresses it Every man is sensible and at times shews that he has conscience and that he has it for this very purpose When it has lost the power of enforcing obedience to its dictates it notwithstanding continues long to excite a painful sense that they ought to be obeyed Hence the shuddering reluctance which precedes the perpetration of iniquity and hence the cutting remorse which attends reflection on it What sinner is there who never had experience of these Which of you dare say that you were perfectly easy in your vices when you first engaged in them and till you had by habit gradually steeled your heart against the sense of guilt Or can the most obdurate among you deny that after all your endeavours to elude the agonies of guilt they still break in upon you on some particular occasions Indeed if we saw not the wicked at greater ease than it is possible to be under the actual feeling of this selftorment we could not doubt that they endured it constantly while they remained conscious of impenitence  in any sin For every sin is a violation of our nature a violation of  the law  of God  written in our hearts  Rom ii  an act of rebellion against conscience to which God hath given a right to govern us and authority to chastise our disobedience and therefore every sin is the proper object of its rebukes and essentially worthy to be condemned by it  THUS every sinner is selfcondemned as he is a man condemned by his own nature we moreover call ourselves Christians and every sinner is likewise selfcondemned as he is a Christian he is condemned by his saith condemned by his profession You live in the habitual practice of sin yet you believe the scripture to be infallible truth which forbids and threatens punishment against every sin Thou livestI speak to every individual who knows that he is guiltyin impurity in fleshly lusts in drunkenness in debauchery yet thou acknowledgest that divine revelation by which  God hath called us not unto uncleanness but unto holiness  Thess iv  and which  teacheth us  to  live soberly  Tit ii  Thou art unjust dishonest oppressive malicious revengeful envious censorious slanderous uncharitable yet thou receivest that religion which teacheth men to  live righteously  Tit ii  and whose  end is charity  Tim i  Thou indulgest impiety profanest the name of God disregardest his authority repinest against his providence livest without any habitual sense of him and nevertheless thou ownest the divinity of that book which requires that  denying all ungodliness we should live godly  Tit ii  and which assures us that love to God  is the first and great commandment  Mat xxii  Thou committest what God has forbidden and yet knowest  that they which commit such things are worthy of death  Rom i  Thou addest iniquity to iniquity and yet believest that the great Judge will say  Depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you  Mat vii  What is this but to believe and to know that you have incurred eternal death  WHILE sinners continue men their nature pronounces them worthy of punishment while they call themselves Christians their saith sentences them to the pains of hell Remorse wringing them with anguish and appalling them with terrors sometimes awakens them to a distracting sense that they are in this manner selfcondemned and even when they elude remorse they often betray their  sense of their being notwithstanding selfcondemned Else why do we seek to disguise or conceal our vices Or why are we ashamed when they are detected Is not this to acknowledge that we disapprove them and know that they deserve to be disapproved by all men Or why do we condemn vice in others often the very vice in which we indulge ourselves What is this but in judging another to give sentence against ourselves The inconsistence is very common The legislator enacts laws and fixes heavy penalties against crimes in which himself lives The magistrate executes the laws on his fellowsubjects for offences from which himself is by no means free he passes sentence on them for dishonesty while himself is guilty of partiality oppression or corruption he inflicts death on the murderer while himself sheds innocent blood under the forms of public justice The preacher denounces the vengeance of God against sins which stain his own practice One man censures another or indignantly prosecutes him for transgressions notoriously chargeable upon himself or which he indulges in another form or with greater secrecy or from which he has abstained only for want of opportunity By all this we judge ourselves in another man's person and proclaim that even when we are  in our sins we  condemn  ourselves  in that thing  which  we  allow  Rom xiv    Is it pos  ble then that any person who lives in sin can avoid condemning himself when he shall stand before the judgmentseat of Christ  IT is very true that in this life the wicked are not always sensible of their being selfcondemned But can this be any securityI will not say against the judgment of Godbut against the judgment of their own hearts hereafter They are already actually selfcondemned to make them sensible of it is all that is wanting to render them miserable If in this life they never became sensible of it what would it avail them A criminal under sentence of death may fall asleep and lose all consciousness of his condition but is he therefore not condemned to death or is it therefore impossible that he should ever again reflect on his being condemned And if the wicked are now so fast asleep so thoughtless so stupid as to have lost all consciousness of their guilt is this a proof is it so much as the faintest presumption either that they are not really guilty or that they shall never feel themselves guilty There are many objects in this world fit to divert or to blunt the feeling of their real state but at the  resurrection these shall be all removed and what can obstruct it then The present tranquillity of the sinner gives him no security against the tortures of an evil conscience even throughout this life He needs only think seriously but for one hour of what he is and what he has done to be wretched On the most incidental recollection of his more heinous sins regret dissatisfaction shame terror consternation rise and seize upon him like tormenters let loose from hell to punish him before the time Often when he affects a cheerful countenance often when none suspects his hidden woe the fiends which haunt the guilty breast prey inwardly upon him and make him miserable in his own reflections and forebodings Can they fail then to invade him in the awful hour of his final judgment They will assault him with tenfold rage Their wounds will be all empoisoned with the corroding venom of despair  THUS sinners the present condition of your souls evinces that you must be selfcondemned at the day of judgment You are already condemned in your sins by the essential principles of your own nature and by that religion which you believe and profess You are in this manner selfcondemned even when you have no sense or thought of it often you are  awakened in the present world to the cutting sense of it and overpowered with remorse shame and fearful apprehensions these are the imperfect foretastes and they are the express intimations the certain pledges of that unspeakable anguish confusion and terror to which you shall certainly be awakened at the day of judgment For  SECONDLY The nature and circumstances of the judgment are such as cannot fail to rouse the wicked to the sense of their whole guilt and to aggravate it beyond endurance Only fix your attention for a moment on the solemn process on the awful transactions of the day of vengeance and doubt of it if you can How dreadfully do they surpass all the occurrences which have often alarmed wicked men with an excruciating consciousness of their own demerit  I WILL not enlarge on the convulsions of nature and the appearances of terror which will precede and introduce the day of the Lord the  roarings  of  the sea  Luke xxi  the  quakings  of the  earth  Ver  the  blood and fire and pillars of smoke  Joel ii    the signs and wonders in heaven  Ver Luke xxi    the  stars falling  down  Mat xxiv    the moon turned into blood and the sun into  an orb of  darkness  Luke xxi  all dreadfully announcing the approach of the Judge These portents will dismay the wicked overwhelm them with  distress  distract them  with perplexity  Ver  melt their heart in the midst of them and cause them to  mourn and wail  Mat xxiv  But they will be perceived only by those who will be then alive It is by the resurrection that all the rest of the wicked shall be aroused to the tortures of selfreproach  An angel cometh down from heaven and crieth with a loud voice  and soundeth  the trump of God  Rev x    The grave  the earth  the sea give up their dead  Rev xx Thess iv    The dead hear the voice of the Son of God and live and come forth  John v    That voice that trump which raises the dead awakens the wicked to all the misgivings of conscious guilt to the full view of all the horrors of their miserable state it awakens them to fruitless remorse and racking despair How can it fail The guiltyit is the decree of God the unchangeable law of human natureare easily alarmed they catch a consuming flame from every strange occurrence The sons of Jacob  but felt some some hardship and apprehended some danger in a distant country and immediately their conscience reminded them of their illdesert in selling Joseph  Gen xlii  Belshazzar had made a splendid feast and was indulging himself amidst his lords his wives and his concubines in all the pleasures of luxury wine and revelling when  the fingers of a man's hand came forth and wrote upon the wall  he understood not what but it conjured up terrors to his mind in the very hour of dissipation and riot  the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another  Dan v  The very winds will sometimes seem to whisper their offences to the wicked And will not that voice force them on their remembrance which soundeth louder than the thunder from the one end of heaven to the other that voice which they know to be the call to judgment The signal for the coming of an earthly judge is terrifying to the criminal how much more terrifying to every conscious sinner must that trumpet be which announces the appearance of the universal Judge from heaven and proclaims the great and last assizeAwakened by that trumpet to the torturing sense of  guilthappy for them to have slept for everbut awake they mustthe wicked come forth reluctant ghastly trembling And to what a scene How changed from the present world In the present world the objects of sense divert your thoughts from yourselves the bustle of business engrosses your attention gaieties and amusements dissipate your reflection inconsideration hides your real character from your eyes the avocations of life turn off the anguish which your suspicions of it sometimes threaten But at the resurrection the phantoms have disappeared they find no place beyond the grave they have left you distracted for not having sooner discovered their destructive vanity Even on earth they could not always infatuate you into peace your own heart knows that guilt has sometimes pierced it like a sharp arrow when there appeared no hand which let it fly and when absorbed in worldly cares or dissolved in the effusest mirth you seemed to be secure from every wound when then you rise naked from the grave and can find no shield and when all things around you conspire in impressing you with your guilt how certainly and how deeply shall it lacerate your souls To think is to be miserable and not to think is impossible In the present world when the sinner is roused from his thoughtlessness and constrained  strained to reflect upon his ways he can often elude the rebukes of conscience by the chicanery of selfdeceit He can persuade himself that his sins are small and abate the severity of remorse he can misrepresent his vices as innocent and stifle the uneasy sense of them he can confound them with virtue and glory in what is in truth his shame But the brightness of Christ's coming will reveal all the illusions of selfdeceit Every thing will appear as it really is No fascination can hide or disguise a single crime Every sin starts up in its genuine form its baseness is written on it as with a sunbeam no colouring can varnish over its deformity no philm can obstruct the full perception of it All the painted virtues of men to their confusion shew themselves real vices their laborious religion is discovered to have been but abject superstition their flaming zeal but bigotry bitterness and cruelty their prudence and frugality avarice their generosity vanity and profusion their charity ostentation their rigid justice hardheartedness and rancour The past success of their selfimposition adds to the bitterness of their reflections We befool ourselves whenever we attempt to disguise our vices from ourselves It is to be willingly lulled into a false security which must end in unexpected ruin In the present world by continuing  to act in bold defiance to conscience the wicked can stupify it and stop its mouth from either inculcating their duty or warning them of their danger But the effrontery of the most daring and abandoned sinner will fail when he is called to judgment Though he could dispute the commands of conscience and despise its threatenings of punishment he finds that when the season for punishment is come it inflicts it with a power that is irresistible Pierced by its stings he writhes himself in torture he is embowelled with agonies they are entwisted with the essential principles of his frameThe night is past the darkness which concealed him from his own eyes is over and gone gone with them and gone for ever his rest and peace He laments that ever he was at rest he bewails that ever he enjoyed peace in sin It has forfeited his everlasting peace There is no longer a possibility of disregarding the things which were unseen and deemed remote perhaps uncertain The cause of disregarding them has ceased All other things have fled before the glories of the last day like mist before the wind These alone are present now they are heard and seen and felt The sinner was forewarned that he would be brought into judgment he nevertheless indulged himself in what he knew could not endure the trial  and he found means to evade the painful apprehension of his condemnation which might have restrained him But the severer pain which he now endures by what means can he evade The angel of the resurrection has with the blast of his breath  swept away  all  the refuges of lies  Isa xxviii  He might have known what has now befallen him He could not avoid sometimes dreading it He might have prevented it But now it is inevitable The reflection aggravates the tortures of remorse and terror to whose united sury his sepulchre has cast him out Neither heaven nor earth neither eternity nor time contains aught that can alleviate his pain The past the future and the present conspire to inflame it The past is a precious opportunity of obtaining eternal happiness wilfully lost and lost for ever The future discloses only the certain prospect of punishment for having lost it The present is full of agonizing reflections and fearful apprehensions and of objects calculated for driving them into his inmost soul It is the state of retribution not the state of trial into which he has arisen The appointed messenger has already proclaimed  that there shall be time no longer  Rev x  he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him  be filthy still  Rev xxii  He cannot indulge the saintest hope of retrieving his condition In the moment of deep remorse for an atrocious sin an awakened conscience sometimes even in this life represents it as unpardonable then it will declare with irresistible persuasiveness that every unforsaken sin is in truth unpardonable How dreadful is the misery of guilt and despair united If guilt may become the most unsufferable torment that can seize a man even now when there is room for its being expiated what will it be when there is no more place for repentance In vain would we attempt to express to the full the torture which vice has often inflicted on the guilty mind the inward pain which drove Adam to hide himself from God the consternation which shook Belshazzar at his idolatrous debauch the anguish which tore the traitor Judas when he hanged himself the wretchedness which wrung the wicked emperour when he defied all the gods and goddesses to make it greater Much less can we put in words that complicated agony which the wicked shall suffer at the last It surpasses those greatest distresses incident to mortal man more than they surpass the slightest ailment that draws a tear from a puny or fretful child To see that  the punishment of hell is to be instantly inflicted to be confounded with its greatness yet to feel it perfectly just not to dare to call it too severe not to be able to allege a reas  n why it should not be rigorously executedIt is an agony without a name  THE whole world is assembled The sinner beholds thousands like himself pale trembling agitated by the same unutterable agonies Can the sight make him forget himself or ease the torment which arises from reflecting on himself It must be but a slight distress in which one can derive consolation from his having fellowsufferers The horrors of guilt admit no alleviation from companions in misery they are heightened by the sight of them it reverberates a man's reflections upon himself and sharpens them The sight of an accomplice though he betrayed no symptoms of a troubled conscience the conviction of another for a crime similar to their own though they were in no danger of detection has sometimes surprised the wicked into a recollection of misdeeds which they had long forgotten and kindled a devouring fire within them And can the presence of all the world of sinners at the last day fail to kindle a fire like hell in every wicked man when their agonies are impressed on every feature  obvious in the quaking of every joint intuitively seen and when he knows that he and they together have  come forth to condemnation  He meets his associates in vice and is overwhelmed with additional confusion He meets his seducers and his rage against them convulses him with a fresh torment He meets those whom he has corrupted and their upbraidings harrow up his soul The misery of every sinner is contagious as the pestilence Every groan of a guilty heart serves for fuel to feed the flames of all the restBut here likewise are all the generations of the righteous They rise as they fell asleep intermingled with the wicked But how splendidly distinguishable from them By the solemnities of this great day they are fixt in awe but it is serene and pleasant they rejoice they triumph in confidence of the approbation of the Judge their serenity and their joy every moment grow and become more conspicuous by the emanations of their inward gladness their very bodies are already glorified All the tokens of their blessedness are like barbed arrows tearing the hearts of the wicked They  run to and fro like sparks among the stubble  Wisd iii  and lay waste their spirits within them Even on earth the good man  John v  though compassed with infirmities depressed by poverty despicable for his external meanness reputed unhappy in comparison is uneasy to the wicked  he was made to reprove their thoughts  his deeds  upbraid them with their offences he is grievous unto them even to behold  Wisd ii  But when they shall see the whole company of congregated saints raised each in glory and  standing in great boldness  when they shall discern among them the man whose admonitions they slighted whose practice they ridiculed whose person they insulted then  they shall be troubled with terrible fear and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation and groaning for anguish of spirit they shall say within themselves This was he whom we had sometimes in derision and a proverb of reproach we fools accounted his life madness and his end to be without honour how is he numbered among the children of God and his lot is among the saints We have wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction  Chap v  On all the inherent torments of guilt these reflections accumulate the gnawings of unavailing and unrelenting spite and envyBut  all these are  only  the beginnings of sorrows  Mark▪ xiii    THE Judge of the world appears descending in awful majesty  his glory covereth the  heavens  Habak iii    Angels more numerous than the stars of the firmament and more radiant than the sun attend him at his coming The breasts of the wicked are all tumult and distraction horror chills their hearts and shame is upon all their faces The appearance of a single angel with his glory veiled sent on a message of kindness has laid even good men prostrate on the earth in bitter abomination of their vileness and made them to tremble because they were unclean And when the whole host of heaven angels and archangels cherubim and seraphim thrones and dominions principalities and powers shall appear together shining in the fulness of their celestial splendour and on purpose to minister to the final destruction of all the wicked can it be but every sinner must be alarmed into tribulation and anguish and terror in the consciousness of his impurity and guilt Before the face of the Son of God when his glory was hid under  the form of a servant  Phil ii  and when he spake in the mildest accents the ruffians who came up boldly to apprehend him daunted in an instant  went backward and fell to the ground  John  at his word when he bore only  the likeness of m  n  †▪ a whole legion of devils

punish but  certainly  to  take vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ  Thess    When this majestic one so tremendously arrayed on sight of whom less awfully displayed even his beloved John  fell at his feet as dead  Rev i    shall appear to judge the world how shall the wicked stand before him They dare not stand yet stand they must Fear and dismay is upon them  pangs have taken hold of them as the pangs of a woman that travaileth  Isa xxi  They run about howling for shelter they hide themselves in the dens and caverns of the earth they cry out  to the rocks and to the mountains  fall on us and hide us from his face for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand  Rev vi  He abhors their ways and themselves feel them to be abominable He is come to punish them and their own hearts condemn them to the punishment The justice of God demands it they cannot fabricate a plea against its being inflicted The very goodness of God cuts them off from hope it dictated those laws which they have obstinately violated They cannot pray they cannot ask forgiveness their conscience thunders in their ears that it is now impossible They cannot bear to think of the misery which they have entailed upon themselves but they can think of nothing else it obtrudes itself upon them Can the punishment which they dread be heavier than the anguish which they endure already What need of a sentence to compleat their woe They are loaded with greater wretchedness than they can bear But they shudder in expectation of more unsufferable wretchedness  A great white throne  Rev xx  is erected The Son of God sits down upon it The noonday light is lost in the celestial essulgence which surrounds him He casts his eyes upon the wicked and  they are troubled When Peter had fallen  the Lord turned and looked upon him  Luke xxii  It was a look full of compassion yet it cut him to the heart and he  went out and wept bitterly  Ver  If a look of tenderness from Jesus when a prisoner stung Peter with so sharp contrition for a single sin with what horror will his look of anger from  the throne of his glory  Mat xxv  when his face and his eyes shall be more dazzling than the meridian sun overwhelm the wicked in the unavailing recollection of transgressions numberless and atrocious If the sorrow of repentance was so violent what will be the sorrow of consternation and despairThey are brought before the judgmentseat They can make no defence Should they plead any of those excuses with which they were wont to reconcile themselves to their sins they would be turned into evidences and aggravations of their guilt It stares them in the face They accuse themselves they witness against themselves Remorse has often compelled men to publish their crimes when without this they could never have been known in the day of judgment remorse is stronger and dissimulation would be in vain The Judge cannot be deceived nothing can be hid the most perverse  silence the hardiest denial could not prevent a single sin from being  proclaimed upon the housetops  Luke xii  But with what anguish of spirit must they divulge their sins To be forced to accuse a friend especially in a capital case is torture What then must it be for a man to accuse and to give testimony against himself in the most capital case when everlasting destruction must be his sentence The confession of a fault is never unaccompanied with some degree of shame to have a confession extorted from himself of a crime which from consciousness of its baseness he laboured to conceal covers a person with confusion the ignominy of a public confession is so great as to be deemed an expiation of very injurious offences the mortification which it occasions is almost worse than death to avoid the shame of detection men have sometimes rushed into enormous deeds which their very hearts abhorred How then can we conceive the mortification the confusion the disgrace which overpower and rack the sinner when all his sins are dragged out of that darkness in which he hoped to bury them for ever when his own conscience is constrained to disclose his most hidden wickedness to reveal the guilt of all his thoughts and words and actions  before the whole world of reasonable beings the assembly of all nations and ages the numberless hosts of angels the glorious Judge when he is forced with his own mouth to pronounce them atrocious inexcuseable and worthy of damnationThe Judge  sets the wicked on his left hand  Mat xxv  He rehearses their demerits He  convinces them of all their ungodly deeds and of all their hard speeches  Jude  He gives the tremendous sentence  Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels  Mat xxv  It cometh from his gracious lips who died to save them from destruction it wounds the deeper They feel its justice and are struck with horror Heaven and earth resound with the united acknowledgments of men and angels  Thou art righteous O Lord because thou hast judged thus  Rev xvi    THE dissolution of the world will accompany the judgment of mankind and it will heighten the sorrows and the terrors of the wicked The agonies of a person who awakes in the midst of flames and must stand still till they devour him the consternation of a person who perceives the earth opening beneath his feet and howls and sinks into its bowels defy  description but they bear no proportion to the convulsions of the wicked when all nature shall be commixed in universal conflagration the mountains consumed the rocks melted down the earth burnt up the heavens tumbling the stars the moon the sun falling blazing from their orbits A faint description of this catastrophe impresses astonishment what will the execution of it be The world on fire would be in itself a sight of terror but the wicked are involved in its destruction It wrings them with a tormenting sense of the folly of their sins A heavy loss or a deep affliction is generally sufficient to open the eyes of the sinner to the unprofitableness of his vices But now his all is lost his affliction is complete In that world were all the objects which tempted him to commit his sins all the objects in which he sought his happiness his only portion and now it is gone for ever He has wearied himself for things which are not The whole creation is converted into a weapon for avenging God upon his enemies The bottomless pit is uncovered Hell opens its mouth  The angels gather out of the kingdom of God all them that offend and all them which do iniquity and cast them into the furnace of fire  Mat xiii  The sense of  guilt remains The torture of selfcondemnation aggravates all their sufferings The abyss is full of  weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth  Matt xxv    WHAT madness is it to rush on all these complicated horrors It is a madness chargeable on all who live in wickedness They are the necessary consequences of wickedness Consider them in time and be persuaded to repent of all your sins Ye giddy and ye thoughtless attend to them and learn to think seriously of your most important interests if ye trifle away the season in which they may be secured ye will be awakened to thoughtfulness when it can avail only to discover and enhance your irreparable misery Ponder then ye hypocrites they are your portion cease to impose yourselves upon the world for other than you are study to be really what you wish to appear in the hour of judgment your falsehood will be exposed and the rottenness of your hearts shewn naked to the whole creation whatever is not sincere and genuine will be a sting your fair pretences and goodly professions will be your confusion Think of them ye abandoned ye openly profane harden not your hearts  any longer in your profligacy your bold contempt of obligation will be no defence in the day of your account against the lashes of your consciences for having violated it your audacity in committing sin will be changed into a stounding dread of the merited punishment of sin If you have fortified yourselves in obduracy by casting off the belief of revelation the false courage which this intoxication has produced will fail in the morning of the resurrection your boasted freedom and depth of thought will unmask itself and stand forth a vicious prejudice armed with scourges to chastise you as its voluntary slaves you will be forced to reproach yourselves for having disobeyed the gospel which you disbelieved because God gave you the opportunity of believing it and you will discover that even its falshood could not vindicate you because the principles of your own reason and the dictates of your own conscience inculcate the very virtues which it requires If you have renounced the principles of reason persuaded yourselves that there is no God nor future state and debauched yourselves from the very sense of good and evil yet your infidelity will vanish in the grave the resurrection will convince you to your unutterable anguish that you are not beasts which perish you shall find that to baffle the suggestions of your moral nature  is not to subvert its constitution conscience will reassume its power reason will reassert its rights you shall see the face of that God whom you denied and sink beneath his terrors in that state of retribution which you derided Ye who believe the gospel but obey it not ye who pervert it from its real intention and turn its grace into licentiousness ye who abuse its promises to cherish the hope of happiness on any terms consistent with wilful sin be assured that its purity will render you without excuse in the day of wrath and force your own mouth to condemn you if you forsake not your sins the religious professions which you now regard as an impenetrable shield will fly from your grasp and leave you defenceless against the wounds of guilt Ye who are blind to your own character and keep yourselves easy in your sins by the artifices of selfdeceit open your eyes in time behold yourselves as you truly are and be reformed when it is too late your eyes will certainly be opened and no disguise no varnish will be able to hide from them the blackness of your hearts and the vileness of your practices Consider sinners and tremble and be troubled that by ceasing to be sinners ye may have rest in the final day of tribulation  IF you can withstand incitements to repentance so alarming you must even sleep on in sin and take your rest on the brink of destruction Yet your  judgment lingereth not  your selfcondemnation  slumbereth not  Pet ii  Be persuaded to prevent it speedily Under a deep sense of the dreadful issue of iniquity let us call ourselves to a strict account and diligently search out our most secret sins For every sin with which your conscience charges you condemn yourselves honestly and impartially Excuse none of your sins extenuate none of them represent them all to yourselves in their whole enormity Shrink not from the remorse which the view of them produces however severe it is a wholesome pain pursue it to repentance rear it into a vehement and habitual abhorrence of evil Actuated by this principle guard carefully against every sin abstain from whatever you must disapprove upon reflection allow not yourselves in any thing which you but suspect that you will afterwards wish undone Let conscience informed by that  gospel according to  which you  shall be judged  Rom ii  be your guide in every part of your conduct for what you do by its direction you shall never need to condemn yourselves As long as you find any thing in you which your hearts condemn you remain imperfect labour  to become more perfect Every day amend some fault in your temper or some error in your practice Wear off by degrees your most natural infirmities reckon every defect in your virtue a real vice Leave nothing for which your hearts can reproach you if for any thing they now reproach you and you forsake it not they will reproach you more grievously at the last day Decline not the labours of reformation and improvement they alone can preserve you from the agonies of selfcondemnation and from the wrath of God and amidst all the solemnities of the judgment all the convulsions of nature and all the terrors of the wicked they will give the righteous peace confidence and joy and fix them in the mansions of everlasting happiness  Let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his  Num xiii    Amen  SERMON XI IN FOUR PARTS THE INFLUENCE OF THE PASTORAL OFFICE ON THE CHARACTER  Preached before THE SYNOD OF ABERDEEN At ABERDEEN  April  and published at their Desire  TITUS i  first Clause  A Bishop must be blameless as the steward of God  PART I  IN forming general conclusions from particular instances especially when our experience of these instances has not been uniform great caution is necessary on every subject to preserve us from mistakes But a peculiar degree of caution is necessary in forming general maxims concerning  characters  because the circumstances on which characters depend are both more complicated and more uncertain in their operation than the causes of  natural effects  On this account observations must be made on a very great number of individuals before we can judge with accuracy concerning the character of the nation or the profession to which these individuals belong and even after we have made the most extensive observations we ought still to remember that the maxim which we form far from being an universal truth will necessarily be liable to numberless exceptions  IT is however undeniable that there are few subjects on which men judge either more rashly or more dogmatically than on the characters both of nations and of particular professions They impute the faults which they have observed in a few individuals to a whole nation or order They often also embrace the groundless prejudice so closely that when they afterwards discover many other individuals who appear to be free from the blemish which they had expected to find in them they suppose them to be tainted with it notwithstanding and take it for granted that it would become obvious in proper circumstances  IN no instance has this shameful prejudice been indulged more freely than in forming a disadvantageous idea of the clergy in general  on account of the vices of some who have been members of that society And because ministers are the public teachers of christianity the vices imputed to them in a body without evidence have been considered as throwing a reflection on the truth or the efficacy of the religion which it is their business to publish The charge has been commonly enforced by loose and popular declamation fit to make an impression on the imagination of the thoughtless and by consequence to gain their passions to the party but absolutely insufficient to convince the impartial and inquisitive If there be any difficulty in confuting the accusations that are commonly brought against our order and against the gospel on our account it arises not from the strength of the arguments by which they are supported but from the total want of argument  THE most natural and direct method of proving that the clergy deserve the disagreeable character which is sometimes ascribed to them would doubtless be to examine the temper and conduct of the several individuals and to shew from an intimate knowledge of them that the majority are really guilty of the vices imputed to the order A candid enquirer would likewise choose before he pronounced sentence concerning their character  on the whole to compare them with the individuals of other professions and to see what proportion the virtues and the vices of the  clergy  bear to those of the  laity  It will scarcely be pretended that this species of proof has been attempted by those who are so liberal in their declamations against the vices of the ministers of the gospelBut though they could produce this proof in its greatest strength it would still be difficult to shew that the faults of ministers can be justly charged on the Christian religion to the rules of which it is manifest these faults are absolutely contrary The moral tendency of the doctrines of the gospel and the purity and sublimity of its precepts ought always to preserve it free from blame on account of the vices of any who profess to believe it Before these vices be imputed to the gospel it should certainly be shown that there is some doctrine or precept or example recommended in Scripture which gives countenance to them  BUT though the method of proof which we have mentioned be the most natural and direct upon a subject of this kind it must be acknowledged that another species of reasoning may be likewise used All arguments concerning matter of fact are ultimately founded on experience but it is not necessary to have  recourse in every argument to experience of instances precisely similar to that which we infer It is often sufficient that the present argument be supported by some general maxims which are clearly deducible from experience We may conclude that a man who is intrusted with absolute power will probably abuse it not only from instances of tyrants who have abused it but also from the more general observation of examples which occur of corruption and insolence in private life In like manner could it be fairly proved that there are circumstances essential to the ministerial office which according to our general observation of human nature have a direct and primary tendency to produce certain vices in those who exercise that office and should it be inferred from this that these vices will be characteristical of the order and that the religion which institutes the office is the occasion of them we could not justly refuse to admit the inference This method of proof has been attempted by a late author in an  Essay on national Characters  THE character which he draws is this `'Tis a trite but not altogether a false maxim  that Priests of all religions are the some  and though the character of the profession will not in every instance prevail over the personal character yet it is sure always to predominate with the greater number For as chymists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they be extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire a uniform character which is entirely their own and which in my opinion is generally speaking not the most amiable that is to be met with in human society It is in most points opposite to that of a soldier as is the way of life from which it is derived  Declining the direct  proof of the vices commonly imputed to the clergy from immediate experience he has  THOUGH all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain times and in certain dispositions yet are there few or none who have it to that degree and with that constancy which is requisite to support the character of this profession It must therefore happen that clergymen being drawn from the common mass of mankind as people are to other employments by the views of profit the greatest part though no atheists or freethinkers will find it necessary on particular occasions to feign more devotion than they are at that time possest of and to maintain the appearance of fervour and seriousness even when jaded with the exercises of their religion or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life They must not like the rest of the world give scope to their natural movements and sentiments they must set a guard over their looks and words and actions and in order to support the veneration paid them by the ignorant vulgar they must not only keep a remarkable reserve but must promote the spirit of superstition by a continued grimace and hypocrisy This dissimulation often destroys the candour and ingenuity of their tempers and makes an irreparable breach in their characters  IF by chance any of them be possest of a temper more susceptible of devotion than usual so that he has but  occasion for hypocrisy to support the character of his profession it is so natural for him to overrate this advantage and to think it atones for every violation of morality that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite And though few dare openly avow these exploded opinions that every thing is lawful to the saints and that they alone have a property in their goods yet may we observe that these principles lurk in every bosom and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit that it may compensate for many vices and enormities This observation is so common that all prudent men are on their guard when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion though at the same time they confess that there are many exceptions to this general rule and that probity and superstition are far from being incompatible  drawn a character for them though he admits of many exceptions in individuals which is by  MOST men are ambitious but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the interests of society The ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds And having got what Archimedes only wanted viz another world on which he could fix his engines no wonder they move this world at their pleasure  MOST men have an overweening conceit of themselves but these have a peculiar temptation to that vice who are regarded with such veneration and are even deemed sacred by the ignorant multitude  MOST men are apt to bear a particular regard for the members of their own profession but as a lawyer a physician or merchant does each of them follow out his business apart the interests of these professions are not so closely united as the interests of clergymen of the same religion where the whole body gain▪ by the veneration paid to their common tenets and by the suppression of antagonists  no means amiable a character which includes many of the blackest vices in human nature  FEW men can bear contradiction with patience but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this article because all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with and they alone pretend to a divine and supernatural authority or have any colour for representing their antagonists as impious and profane The Odium Theologicum or theological hatred is noted even to a proverb and means that degree of rancour which is the most furious and implacable  THUS many of the vices of human nature are by fixt moral causes inflamed in that profession and though several individuals escape the contagion yet all wise governments will be on their guard against the attempts of a society who will for ever combine into one faction and while it acts as a society will for ever be actuated by ambition pride and a persecuting spirit  THE temper of religion is grave and serious and this is the character required of priests which confines them to strict rules of decency and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance amongst them The gaiety much less the excesses of pleasure is not permitted in that body and this virtue is perhaps the only one they owe to their profession In religions indeed founded on speculative principles and where public discourses make a part of religious service it may also be supposed that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learning of the times though it is certain that their taste in eloquence will always be better than their skill in reasoning and philosophy But whoever possesses the other noble virtues of humanity meekness and moderation as very many of them no doubt do is beholden for them to nature or reflection not to the genius of his calling' Hume's Essays Moral and Political Essay  and he has endeavoured to prove that this character naturally results from the very genius of the ministerial calling  THIS is a representation chiefly of the MORAL character of the clergy and to that the following discourse is wholly confined But as an insinuation is likewise made to the disadvantage of their INTELLECTUAL character it will be proper to remark that this insinuation is both of little weight and in a great measure without foundationIt is of little weight for taste is more general among all men than skill in philosophy A greater number can judge of beauty than of truth Many are moved by the eloquence of a discourse who cannot examine the justness of the reasoning We meet much oftener with a degree of imagination and sensibility of temper sufficient to form a good speaker than with the penetration which is necessary for investigating the causes of things and inventing just theories It can be no reflection on the clergy that taste is more universal than philosophical genius in their profession as well as in all other professions Their taste will naturally be better in eloquence than in other arts because their office leads them to apply especially to thatIn every sense in which it can be considered as a reflection on our order the insinuation is entirely groundless Were mankind persuaded that we are unacquainted with the rules of just reasoning and only qualified for popular declamation on principles taken for granted without enquiry this might perhaps incline them to listen to those who tell them that the truths of religion which we teach are mere fables destitute of evidence though we be not possessed of a degree of reason sufficient for detecting the fallacious arguments produced in support of them it might prepare them for expecting wonderful discoveries in the writings of infidels and prejudice them against our vindications of religion I will not say that this author made the insinuation with a design to promote this end because he has not informed us what is his design But I will say this end can be really promoted by nothing less than a proof that the clergy are weak reasoners in comparison with the rest of mankind and I will venture to affirm that neither the nature of their employment nor experience of their real character gives reason for representing them in this light Their profession turns their attention to eloquence but does not divert it from just reasoning Their public functions lead them to employ all their powers of persuasion in inculcating truth and goodness on their hearers their studies lead them also to examine most questions of importance to enquire into the abstrusest truths and to detect the most subtle errors Corruptions of religion interwoven with the tenets of a false philosophy have sometimes retarded the improvement of science but it is the business of ministers to teach only pure religion it is a perversion of their office to support corruptions of religion and the effects of this perversion cannot justly be imputed to the genuine spirit of the office In fact the clergy have never been remarkably defective in the knowledge of philosophy There have been periods in which the philosophy of the times was almost wholly confined to them When the scholastic philosophy prevailed universally they discovered as great subtlety as men of other professions As great a proportion of the clergy as of any other class have excelled in the knowledge both of nature and of the human mind It is natural for freethinkers to reckon the reasonings of the clergy concerning religion weak and inconclusive because they are contradictory to their own but we are not afraid to desire the world to compare the writings of men of our order with those of the most admired infidels in respect either of the truth of the principles from which they argue or of the strength and closeness of the arguments  THAT candour which the gospel recommends and which ought always to prevail in the heart of a minister of the gospel forbids me to attempt detracting from the real merit or abilities of this author He is possessed of a very considerable share of genius and penetration  This will gain him attention from the inquisitive and will render his reasonings on every subject more specious than those of many others and on that account more dangerous when at any time he happens to mistake Is it not then worth while my reverend fathers and brethren to enquire whether his charge be just Will it be unsuitable to the present occasion to examine fairly and impartially what is the natural influence of the ministerial office upon the characters of those who exercise it  THE ungainly potrait that has been drawn for the ministers of the gospel suggested this investigation to my thoughts When I found myself obliged by the authority of my superiors to appear in this place on the present occasion I willingly chose this subject It affords me an opportunity of considering the ministerial character and office in a point of view in which they have not been frequently regarded It frees me from the necessity of even  seeming  to give directions to those from whom it becomes me rather to receive instruction for the very nature of the design confines me to enquiry At the same time it will appear that the enquiry is far from being merely speculative or unimproving and that it has on the contrary the most intimate connexion  with practice I enter on it with a sincere desire to vindicate our sacred function from reproach and will conduct it with an eye especially to that author to whom I have referred already Priests of the temper which he describes would unite in the bitterest invectives against an antagonist who has attacked the whole body of the clergy in a manner so unreserved But that is not the temper of the ministers of Jesus Christ I know well that my reverend hearers would not excuse me if I made the least approach to rancour or unbecoming warmth against him if I opposed him in any other spirit than  the spirit of meekness  Gal vi i  or if I considered my subject in any other manner than with that impartiality which will be observed by those who seek only to discover truth  THE Apostle  Paul  says in my text  A bishop must be blameless as the steward of God  It will be evident that these words lead naturally to the proposed enquiry if we attend to the manner in which they are introduced especially if we consider at the same time the import of the words themselves in the original The Apostle reminds  Titus ver  that he had left him in  Crete  for this purpose that he  might ordain elders or presbyters in every city men blameless free not only from gross and scandalous wickedness but from every species of vice for the word here used has a respect to the judgment of God and not merely to the sentiments of men  See Cor i Col i  In my text he shews that when he required presbyters to be blameless he enjoined only what the very nature of their office demands A presbyter is by his office  a bishop  that is  an overseer  and according to the language of the New Testament as appears from the only place where the term is used in such a way that its meaning can be precisely determined  Acts xv    an overseer of all the flock of the church of God  On this account he  must be blameless  steady and universal virtue as far as it can be attained by human nature is a qualification absolutely necessary for the exercise of his office To render the necessity of this character still more evident the Apostle adds  as the steward of God  He represents the Christian church as the family of God and informs us that ministers are appointed to dispense to the several members of it that spiritual food by which they may be nourished to eternal life As he elsewhere characterises them more explicitly they are  stewards of the mysteries of God  Cor iv  teachers not of their own  opinions but of the doctrines of the Christian revelation The import of the text is therefore plainly this  the most exalted and blameless virtue is requisite from the very nature of their office in those whose business it is to teach religion and to oversee the morals of the people  Does not this assertion of the Apostle imply that the ministerial office has a tendency upon the whole to form a good and virtuous character Could his maxim be true if that very office had an unalterable tendency to inflame many of the basest vices of human nature and to produce a character which every good man must regard with indignation May not we then with sufficient propriety take occasion from this text to enquire what is that temper which our employment as ministers of the gospel tends to cultivate in our souls  IN prosecuting this subject I will FIRST enquire how far a tendency in the ministerial office to form a character in some respects disagreeable or even a character exposed to the danger of becoming vicious could reasonably affect either the credit of that office or the excellence of the Christian religion in which the office is founded  SECONDLY I will enquire whether that character which the ministerial office tends to form be virtuous or vicious on the whole  THIRDLY I will enquire how far this office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame those particular vices which some have represented as characteristical of our order  FIRST I will enquire how far a tendency in the ministerial office to form a character in some respects disagreeable or a character exposed to the danger of becoming vicious could reasonably affect either the credit of that office or the excellence of the Christian religion  IT is not unusual to draw from an argument a conclusion totally different from that which it really proves and by means of the ambiguity of words or the confusion of men's ideas the fallacy often escapes detection and it is taken for granted that a proposition is proved for which in fact there has not been a single argument proposed Attempts have been sometimes made to shew that the occupation of ministers tends to prevent their acquiring that artificial polish which adds gracefulness to the behaviour of the higher ranks of  mankind and when plausible evidence for this trivial charge has been produced men have triumphed as if they had demonstrated a very different proposition that the character of our profession is positively disagreeable contemptible or ridiculous In like manner when men have produced such arguments as seem to make it probable that the turn of character and manners which is promoted by the genius of the ministerial office will be unfit to engage the  liking  of the generality or will be  disagreeable  in some situations they have taken it for granted that these arguments prove with equal force that this turn of character and manners is likewise positively  vicious  and unfit to gain the inward  esteem  or the moral  approbation  of men  A MODERATE degree of understanding might preserve a person from being deceived by sophisms so palpable But persons of good understanding are often not so ready to exert a very small degree of reflection as to receive every thing without examination which can gratify their own pride or afford them mirth by representing others as proper objects of contempt or ridicule For this reason these arguments or others equally inconclusive have in fact occasioned a great part of the contempt which has been poured out upon the clergy  It will not therefore be unnecessary to remark though the remark be extremely obvious that a character not only may be agreeable when many agreeable qualities are wanting in it because the mere absence of them gives no positive disgust but also may be really disagreeable or unfit to engage a general liking and yet be so far from vicious that it shall on the contrary command the moral approbation and force the good opinion and even the veneration of mankind  As characters and actions may be considered in various lights they may gratify a spectator by sentiments totally distinct and different These sentiments are very apt to be confounded because they are all agreeable but every man who desires to think with accuracy must be at pains to preserve them separate A  liking  to a character is very different from the  approbation  or  esteem  of it The former sentiment is excited chiefly by the more trivial accomplishments of the man the latter only by such as are important The qualities which most effectually engage the liking of the generality are of too low an order to be regarded as being even akin to the moral virtues nay there are some  vices  which because they diffuse a certain ease and gaiety and sprightliness over the temper and behaviour are very apt  to obtain the liking even of those in whom a moment of reflexion produces abhorrence of their baseness But it is only solid virtue rooted deep in the temper and exerted regularly in the conduct that can either gain or preserve the real inward approbation and esteem of mankind It likewise deserves to be remarked that a man's own turn of character has great influence in determining the objects of his likeing who will be those chiefly whose manners resemble his own and therefore this sentiment will be variable and precarious Approbation is more permanent and universal and less dependent on the peculiarities of temper it is often bestowed unwillingly by men on those to whom their own consciences tell them to their anguish that themselves bear no similitude  SUPPOSE now my fathers and brethren that some person should assert in writing or in conversation that our office deprives us of opportunities for acquiring that exterior polish of manners which is very acceptable to the generality and indeed graceful in itself This is really the whole amount of some of those superficial reflexions which are often thrown out against us The author whom we have principally in our eye does not expressly urge this insignificant accusation yet he seems to insinuate  not only that we are obnoxious to it but also that it doth detract from the credit of our office for he mentions good breeding and openness of behaviour as one of the amiable qualities which enter into the character of a soldier and are naturally derived from his way of life and he tells us that the character of a clergyman as well as his way of life is in most points opposite to that of a soldierNeed we be much concerned to enquire whether the charge be true or false If we should acknowledge it do you think that either the importance of our office or the excellence of our religion would suffer by the acknowledgment Nay might not the ministerial character be nevertheless agreeable and fit to procure even the liking of the generality For might not it contain those amiable inward qualities of which external politeness is only either the expression or the mimickry and from which openness and ease of behaviour deriveth all its merit  SUPPOSE again that it should be asserted that the character which naturally results from our office is very generally  disagreeable  must we take it for granted immediately that this character is  vicious  May not we reasonably ask before we admit this conclusion to whom and in what particular manner it is disagreeable  It is asserted by others and it is not dissembled by ourselves that our office tends to form us to a grave and serious temper that it discourages the gaiety of pleasure and unthinking levity of behaviour that it confines us to strict rules of decency that it leads us to set a guard over our looks and words and actions and restrains us from giving scope to our natural movements and sentiments whenever they are either sinful or unbecomingI do not know but there are some particular seasons in which the generality would dislike a man of this character and shun his company But it would be only when they were disposed to exceed the limits of right and innocence And could it be inferred from his being disagreeable to them in this situation that his character is vicious or even that they who dislike him do not really approve and esteem him notwithstanding I doubt not but a person of the character which we have described will be in all situations disagreeable to many He bears no resemblance in his manners to the gay the dissipated and the voluptuous and his presence would lay them under an uneasy restraint They will always  dislike  him but is it certain that even they will always  disapprove  him Or if they should would it be of mighty consequence For could he be more agreeable to them without becoming less virtuous Admit  then that our office naturally produces a turn of character which is disagreeable in some respects will either the credit of that office or the excellence of our religion suffer by this charge if we be able to vindicate our calling from a temper that is really vicious or morally evil  FARTHER brethren is it absolutely cer+tain that every tendency in the ministerial function to produce some real vices in those who exercise it will necessarily detract from its credit or be inconsistent with the perfect purity of the gospel An assertion or insinuation of this nature is plausible indeed yet it may be proved that it ought not to be admitted but under several limitationsWere it the direct and primary tendency of our profession to form a vicious character or to inflame some heinous vices this would certainly reflect dishonour on it This would render ours an unlawful calling because we could not exercise it without doing what is wrong Were there for instance any essential part of our office which we could not execute without imposing  cunningly devised fables  Pet i  on the credulity of mankind or fostering a spirit of superstition among them or offering violence  to their consciences our employment would be so far absolutely immoral This would also reflect dishonour on our religion for that religion could not be true or holy or divine which it were impossible to teach without committing sin Let it be clearly proved that something unlawful must  necessarily  be practised in teaching the doctrines or inculcating the duties of genuine  uncorrupted christianity  by this indeed but by nothing less than this our office and our religion will be exposed to censure  IF any person should discover that though our office tend  primarily  to form and improve a virtuous character it has a remote and  secondary  tendency to produce vicious dispositions in those who resist its original impulse we may give him liberty to avail himself of the discovery as much as he can with reason The amount of the discovery is only this that the best things may be abused that what is naturally calculated for the worthiest purpose may be perverted and after it is perverted rendered subservient to an unworthy and contrary end This is indeed an universal truth Reason is a noble faculty implanted in our nature on purpose to enable us to distinguish truth from falsehood but a superior degree of reason has been often employed to disguise plain truths and  to render errors plausible Natural affection is an amiable instinct designed to prompt the parent to provide for the helpless infant and to submit to all the fatigues which may be necessary for instilling knowledge and virtue into the opening mind yet it frequently degenerates into a vicious sendness which occasions the death or prevents the education of the child The primary end of ingenuous shame and regard to reputation plainly is the prevention of infamous vices but does not this very principle often l  ad m  n to commit one act of wickedness in order to conceal another which they have already perpetrated in secret In a word nothing can have so strong a tendency to promote a good end but it may be perverted to serve a bad or even a contrary purpose Are we then to judge of things by their primary and essential tendency or by that accidental direction which they acquire when they have been abused By the former certainly If it is not sufficient that the primary tendency of a thing be good if it is necessary likewise that it be incapable of perversion or abuse there will be nothing good or wise in art or nature there will be no situation or employment in the world safe or lawful for there is none from which men may not take occasion to fall into vicious conduct And is it fair or reasonable to insist that more is requisite for the vindication of the pastoral office  than of any thing besides Are those vices to be charged on the office which spring only from the abuse of it Are they not rather to be imputed solely to the faults of individuals  WHEN therefore any person asserts that there are circumstances in the pastoral office which tend to inflame any particular vice it is incumbent on him to distinguish carefully between the primary and the accidental tendency of these circumstances If the tendency be but accidental to urge it to the disadvantage of the office is either inadvertently or artfully to confound things totally distinct and thus to render a falsehood plausible or to give a harmless truth an unfavourable aspect it is like hurting a man's reputation by an insinuation which will very probably be misunderstood and which could do no hurt except it were misunderstood  IT has been said that there are certain vices of which ministers are often guilty and into which they are led by their profession Suppose it were alleged as an instance of this that when ministers are conscious of their wanting some virtue which the decorum of their character requires they are apt to affect the outward appearance of that virtue  Such ministers are no doubt guilty of hypocrisy It may be affirmed too in some sense that their profession is the occasion of this hypocrisy because their being conscious that their profession requires the virtue which they affect is their motive in making false pretences to it But is it not plain that in this case the spirit of the office leads them  naturally  not to  affect  the virtue but really to  cultivate  it It can be said to lead to hypocrisy only by  accident  by being perverted from its original and proper aim and its being thus perverted far from implying that it has an immoral tendency sets the strength of its tendency to virtue in the clearest light for it shows that the ministerial office prompts men so powerfully to the culture of virtue that even they who resist its impulse and over whom it has the least power must palliate their want of real virtue to themselves and others by an hypocritical show of goodness  THERE are some vices which bear a general resemblance to certain virtues superstition for instance mimics piety rancour calls itself zeal moroseness would pass for a serious temper Men of all professions often indulge the vice while they flatter themselves that they are cultivating the virtue for which it is mistaken We impute it to their weakness  want of true moral  that a clergyman should in  some specious vice in the  virtue which eminently  of his profession ought we to  vice to the profession Must not we  contrary impute it wholly to the infir  y of the individual and to the general deceitfulness of sin If this can account for similar instances among other ranks of men with what colour of reason can we urge the vice as a proof of an immoral tendency in the ministerial calling  THERE are certain ends naturally desirable to mankind in whatever station they be placed Every station furnishes a man with  lawful  means of promoting these ends but in every station a man has it likewise in his power to pursue them by  unlawful  meansBesides those ends which we may  innocently  aim at there are others which it is  wrong  to pursue but which the corrupt affections of mankind will often lead them to pursue and different wrong ends will be most likely to attract different classes of menIn the present degenerate state of mankind many will pursue unlawful ends or seek to promote such ends as are lawful in themselves by unjustifiable means They have the vicious  bent which occasions this independent of their particular profession but it determines the form which the vice assumes It is in this way that every station and profession has its peculiar temptations and exposes those who occupy it to peculiar dangersNow suppose that the station in which ministers are placed has in like manner its peculiar temptations that ministers may find in their employment unlawful means of attaining a lawful end or that they may render their sacred functions subservient to a wrong end is this any more than happens in other professions If this can expose the ministry to censure must it not equally expose every other occupation Can it then be fairly urged to the disadvantage of this one office in comparison with others If this tendency to vice be but secondary and accidental in other callings must it not be esteemed such also in our vocation If in other employments the fault be chargeable only on the individuals who are guilty pray why should not individual clergymen likewise be alone answerable for yielding to the temptations which arise from their peculiar businessThe office of a clergyman is founded in the gospel but can the gospel be blamed because this office has its peculiar temptations Before you determine that it can stop for a moment and observe  the consequences Other stations are appointed in the course of ordinary providence and their peculiar temptations would reflect the same dishonour upon it If the common temptations of life be not sufficient to overturn the belief of a God and a providence those which are peculiar to the pastoral office cannot affect the truth or the excellence of the gospel Let none therefore throw blame on the Christian ministry on account of its supplying some temptations to vice or on the gospel because it has established an office which is liable to abuse but those who have already embraced atheism and denied the constitution of the world to be wise and goodMankind are at present by the universal appointment of God in a state of trial and exercise There is no circumstance in life but gives us opportunities of acting either virtuously or viciously It is only by putting it in our power to act viciously if we choose that any situation can exercise or improve our virtuous affections Exercise is afforded to out temper not only by the general circumstances of life common to all men but likewise by the peculiar circumstances of particular professions There are peculiar circumstances in the ministerial office as well as in every other which may give exercise to our virtues and improve them but may likewise  as is indeed a necessary consequence prove occasions of vice To assert this is only to say that ministers of the gospel are in a state of probation and discipline in the same sense as other men that their employment as well as other employments contains circumstances fit to draw out virtuous principles and to give them exercise and this surely can derogate nothing from the excellence of their office  BUT suppose that the vices of a wicked minister rise higher in particular instances and become more atrocious than those of others this is so far from  necessarily  implying an immoral tendency in his office that on the contrary it  may  really proceed from the strength of its virtuous tendency for the greater the advantages which this office affords for virtuous practice the greater will be the depravity necessary for abusing them and the more heinous and inveterate the corruption which will spring from the abuseAs the same vicious principle may assume different forms and be exerted in different ways some forms and exertions of it are often more detestable and pernicious than others If then some vicious principle should assume its blackest form in the practice of a clergyman who fosters it and if it should appear to be  determined to that form by the circumstances of his occupation can we arraign the spirit of his office on this account This were to judge of that office only by the abuse of it But do not all men admit it for a maxim that those things are generally the best in themselves the corruption of which is the worst  SUPPOSE again that the employment of a minister contains circumstances which will lead to vicious conduct if the greatest caution be not exercised this would not necessarily prove even that vice will be more common among ministers than among other ranks of men much less would it prove that the spirit of the office is on the whole friendly to vice for it may contain other circumstances which prompt strongly to exert the necessary caution to resist the importunities of vice and to cultivate every virtue The ministerial office may from its being abused and perverted by the weakness or corruption of those who exercise it or from various circumstances in this state of probation in which it is to be executed supply temptations which have a direct and powerful tendency to excite a passion or inclination the indulgence of which will lead the negligent into vicious conduct If this could throw a reflection on the spirit of that office or on the Christian religion which  has instituted it how could we vindicate the ordinary situations in which God places us or the general plan of his providence towards us in the present world Many objects in nature excite passions which crave gratification often when it is vicious to gratify them Were man formed for following thoughtlessly the present inclination these objects would infallibly lead him into vice But we must take the whole of human nature into the account man is endued with a moral principle a principle of reflection whose proper business it is to restrain inclination whenever it cannot be indulged lawfully His state is suited to his whole nature The temptations of life are designed to give him opportunities of exerting reflection of acting with moral attention to his conduct and are sit to strengthen by this means the principle of reflection and improve a habit of selfgovernment which is the great security of virtue They who will not exercise reflection and employ care in controuling their inclinations fall before temptations through their own fault are hardened in vice by means of them and thus render them subservient to a contrary end from that which God has designed and sitted them to answer This is the general constitution of the world yet the Creator is wife and good and perfect The office of a Christian minifter  in like manner supplies temptations with which many comply and which it requires a great degree of care and attention to resist yet that office may be designed for the virtuous improvement of those who occupy it its spirit may tend strongly to promote that improvement and the religion which institutes that office may be holy and divine for it is indeed analogous to the whole plan of providence  I WILL make one supposition more and that as favourable to our adversaries as they can reasonably desire I will suppose that the office of a Christian minister exposes him to greater danger of acting viciously than other men Even this supposition will not avail them much In this case our station would indeed be hazardous to ourselves as a few soldiers are sometimes forced to defend a desperate post in order to preserve a whole army from destruction so we should be exposed to an imminent danger of losing our own souls in promoting the salvation of others But even this would not prove that our office has an immoral tendency in any sense which could affect the credit of our religion It would be only analogous to what happens in the course of nature that some situations supply stronger and more numerous  temptations than others and therefore it could never prove that the gospel is not derived from the Author of nature  THESE observations appeared to be necessary for removing the confusion in which the charge against the spirit of our profession has been commonly involved and for enabling us to detect some of the artifices by which it has been rendered plausible and seemingly important The sum is this If the enemies of our order only prove that our office tends to form a character in which some agreeable qualities are wanting or even a character positively disagreeable in some respects or if they prove that some circumstances in it may be perverted into occasions of vice or that it presents peculiar temptations which it will require great caution to avoid complying with they allege nothing which can justly affect either the spirit of our office or the religion by which it is established If they can prove no more they attack us with insufficient weapons we may expose our bosoms to their pointless arrows without receiving the slightest hurt They show their inclination to annoy us and the undiscerning and the prejudiced may take it for granted that they have given a mortal wound to religion and its ministers But the candid and the considerate will soon  perceive that in order to accomplish their design they must evince that the  original  and  prevailing  tendency of our office is immoral that something vicious is necessary in order to promote its genuine end and to discharge its real duties To discover whether this has ever been evinced or can indeed be evinced is the intention of the sequel  PART II  WITH a view to discover what is the real spirit of the ministerial office we proposed secondly to enquire whether that character which it tends to form be virtuous or vicious on the whole  OUR office is charged expressly only with some particular vices but these are so heinous and so numerous and softened by the mixture of so few virtues that were the charge supported with sufficient evidence it would imply that the natural character of a clergyman is upon the whole vicious and detestable I doubt not however but it will appear by every kind of evidence of which the subject can be supposed capable that a character in all respects virtuous is the natural result of our profession  MAY it not be asserted in the first place with considerable evidence that the clergy in general are in fact equal nay superior to other classes of men in whatever deserves the name of moral virtue And if this be true  will it not form an argument in favour of the genius of our calling For if it really led to vice it could scarce fail to corrupt the greater number It is not easy to prove beyond dispute what depends upon so many instances what requires the observation of many ages and nations nor is it possible on this occasion to enter on a long detail from history to support the assertion but let any person examine with impartiality and he will find that in every state of things ministers of the gospel have had their full proportion of the virtue of the times In the best and the most virtuous ages there have been more of this order eminent for virtue in proportion to the number of those who belong to it than of any other In the most degenerate times when religion has been most perverted from its true design the morals of the clergy have been higher than on a level with those of the laity If there be any period in which it has been otherwise let our adversaries point it outWe own they have great advantages on their sideThe ministerial office leads to privacy and retreat the abuses of it often carry a man into public life On this account the vices of those clergymen who have departed from the genius of their office are conspicuous and liable to be exposed by the torch of history but they who have been steddily actuated by  its genuine spirit have passed through life in a virtuous obscurity revered by those who knew them their memory honoured for a generation or two but totally unregarded by history which confines itself to the actions of the higher ranks of men or to those actions which had an influence on the revolutions of government or on the general state of civil affairsIt will likewise deserve attention that in some establishments of religion many clergymen have not been confined to the proper functions of their office but have devoted themselves chiefly to secular affairs perfectly foreign to it It is not in these that we can expect to find the genuine character of the order for the pastoral office cannot possibly exert its influence on a man who is scarce at all employed in the duties of it The temper of such a person must necessarily be formed principally by those secular occupations in which he is most conversant Yet it is from clergymen in this situation that persons are readiest to take their idea of the whole body because they are most exposed to observationOur adversaries derive another advantage from the unequal manner in which the comparative importance of different virtues and vices is ordinarily estimated Temperance piety and the other virtues which will naturally predominate in the character of  a clergyman are depressed far below their genuine dignity and at the same time many vices frequent among other ranks of men but rarely to be found among the clergy are regarded with a more favourable eye than their real deformity deserves This perversion of moral sentiment if it be not guarded against will necessarily diminish the merit of the clergyman and raise that of the man of the world and thus disguise their true proportion to each otherBut let our adversaries take no more advantage from these or other circumstances than themselves can approve as fair let them examine what has been the real character of the clergy not by selecting a few instances on one side only but by making a complete and impartial induction let them make the same allowance in this case that they would reckon reasonable in other cases let them form their judgment chiefly from those clergymen who have been employed only in the proper duties of their calling at least let them distinguish in others between the vices which belong to them as clergymen and those which have sprung from their adventitious occupations let the several virtues and their opposite vices be valued I will not say according to the Christian standard but according to that standard which the unperverted sentiments of mankind have fixed and  the best heathen moralists have acknowledged let them tell us honestly the result of their enquiry If they should find that ministers of the gospel have been upon the whole more blameless more virtuous than the rest of mankind that they have for the most part fallen in latest with a prevailing corruption of manners that they have often opposed its progress and been least infected with it that sometimes the majority of them have totally escaped the contagion of vice which raged among other ranks they cannot deny that the ministerial office has a strong tendency to promote the practice of universal virtue  THAT the result of their enquiry will be what we have supposed I pronounce with the greater confidence because it seems to be really acknowledged by all mankind It is an undeniable matter of fact that the general sense of mankind proclaims vice to be peculiarly scandalous and virtue to be peculiarly requisite in a clergyman They who pay little regard to the laws of morality in their own conduct demand the most spotless virtue in the teachers of religion Every deviation from strict virtue every instance of vice in men of this profession has always excited greater and more general indignation than similar faults in others Whence does this universal sentiment  arise It can arise from no cause which is not obvious to the very senses of mankind for circumstances which cannot be discovered without close attention and deep penetration will never affect the generality their sentiments and judgments are produced only by plain matters of facts And from what cause can their sentiment on this subject arise but actual experience of the superior virtue of Christian ministers Familiar objects never strike us strongly Vices which we are accustomed to witness we soon learn to behold without a great degree of horror Were a vicious minister very common men must have long ago regarded him with as little indignation as other vicious men They are peculiarly shocked with vice in a clergyman for this reason because they do not find it so frequently in men of this character as in others  BUT this sentiment of the peculiar unsuitableness of vice to the profession of a clergyman deserves to be considered farther for not only do mankind by means of it give testimony that virtue is more general among ministers than among others but it likewise contains a  direct  proof that the genius of our calling is eminently favourable to virtue It supposes that all the world is sensible that ministers of the gospel have from the very  nature of their office peculiar advantages for being virtuous If this were not taken for granted men could never deem vice peculiarly atrocious in a clergyman they could never exact uniform virtue more rigorously from him than from any other person When the situation in which a man is placed lays him under strong temptations to vice we make allowance for it in our censure of him We excuse in some measure the sallies of youth because the passions are violent at that time of life We give some indulgence to the peevishness of old age because the infirmities incident to that period are powerful temptations to ill humour We pity rather than blame a wretch who overcome by torture betrays his friend The judgment is natural necessary and well founded The vices on which we are disposed to pass a heavy censure are those which a man commits without any inducement from his situation those which he is under a strong obligation to avoid and has great advantages for avoiding When all men therefore perceive vice to be incongruous to the character of a clergyman is not this a confession that his sacred function has a peculiar fitness for forming him to virtue Believers and infidels agree in the sentiment on which our argument is founded and therefore must equally perceive its force The natural  sentiments even of those who are most forward to censure the spirit of our office pronounce vice peculiarly odious and virtue peculiarly necessary in a clergyman and these sentiments arising spontaneously and irresistibly in their hearts are a much stronger proof of their being conscious of the moral tendency of the Christian ministry than any refined arguments formed at leisure can be of the contrary Let them either acknowledge that our office urges us powerfully to all virtue or let them regard those vices which they charge upon it as more venial and excuseable as less worthy of disapprobation in a clergyman than in another  BEFORE I leave this topic allow me to make one observation which seems to be of importance in estimating the real character of a clergyman It is the judgment of human nature that every vice has a singular atrocity in him this judgment could not be formed except vice were comparatively rare in that profession and likewise absolutely repugnant to its genuine spirit yet this very judgment has contributed not a little to bestow plausibility on the assertion that the spirit of our profession is immoral an assertion to which it is altogether contradictory The consequence of this judgment has been that while very  high degrees  of vice are overlooked in other men  or at most are slightly blamed the  least appearance  of every vice in a clergyman is immediately remarked and severely condemned By this means a few small vices in him appear both greater and more numerous than many atrocious vices in another because they are more certainly observed and more heavily censured A person is highly disapproved when he bears the character of a clergyman who would have been noways censured if he had belonged to any other order Thus the very tendency of the ministerial office to promote virtue has led men first to think ministers more vicious in comparison with others than they really are and next in consequence of this to charge the office itself with a tendency to vice We own that mankind do us no injustice in reckoning vice more heinous in us than in others but the judgment supposes the spirit of our office to be eminently favourable to virtue and therefore a person cannot fairly avail himself of it who denies this and is examining the real characters of clergymen in order to determine whether the spirit of their office be moral or immoral he ought to estimate  their  actions only by that standard which he applies to the actions of  others  FARTHER it is worth while to observe that they who censure the spirit of our profession  most severely acknowledge its tendency to be moral in one respect There is one virtue strict decency and temperance which they own that we naturally derive from our employment They insinuate indeed that it is the only one But if it be evident that this one virtue necessarily promotes other virtues and gives us advantages for cultivating them it cannot be denied that our calling by its immediate influence on this one will indirectly but really tend to form the other parts of a virtuous temperDecency and temperance implies at least strict abstinence from all the excesses of pleasure from the dissipation of gay and thoughtless mirth and from all those expressions of any of our passions which are unbecoming In consequence of this abstinence the sensual appetites and inferior passions which are always vicious when they become excessive and which in others are apt to become excessive by being indulged without controul will almost unavoidably be preserved weak and moderate in a clergyman This is one important ingredient in a virtuous characterBut this is not all They who are disposed to regard intemperance and levity with the most favourable eye can scarce deny that they often prove occasions of leading men into vices much more heinous There is no crime so atrocious but a man brutified by excess  or dissipated by giddiness may occasionally perpetrate The basest courses have been taken in order to procure gratification to pampered appetites The frequent returns of levity and intemperance may produce repeated acts of any vice and these repeated acts will by degrees render the worst dispositions habitual Our office therefore by confining us to strict rules of decency preserves us from a situation which would put us in imminent hazard of committing many acts of vice and of contracting many evil habits By this means it has a peculiar tendency to produce a general purity of heart which undoubtedly confers very considerable worth upon the characterA strict regard to decency will likewise influence our temper in another way It implies a constant restraint of vicious principles concern that our conduct be right and unblameable and regard to the authority and dictates of the moral faculty Now there is a natural association among our principles of action by means of which any one of them prepares the mind for receiving any other that has the same direction On this account a regard to decency must have a tendency to introduce into the soul justice veracity humility meekness patience forbearance and in a word all the virtues which like itself hold of controul and are included in the  idea of selfgovernment The direct principle of all these is the same with that of decency a sense of duty a submission to the law of conscience As every principle is strengthened by being habitually exerted the authority of conscience will be confirmed by our regard to decency it will be enabled to controul every wrong affection with greater ease and by being accustomed to submit to its government in one instance we shall be better disposed to submit to it in all Indeed men are often surprisingly absurd and inconsistent in their conduct one passion may be perfectly ungoverned while another is restrained On this account we cannot affirm that a regard to decency will  necessarily  produce all the virtues of selfgovernment but it certainly  tends  to have a favourable influence upon them and our office by almost  certainly  producing that will  probably  promote these othersThe principal obstruction to the prevalence of good affections arises from the strength of some vicious passions which oppose their exercise A regard to decency by contributing  directly  to weaken these vicious passions will lay the mind open to the influence of worthy affections and will thus give us great advantages for acquiring all those amiable virtues which consist in the exercise of themIf therefore strict decency and temperance result naturally  from our profession it must have at least an indirect tendency to promote all other virtues The concessions of our adversaries however small they may appear imply that our profession has a real tendency to promote universal virtue  THESE general arguments drawn from the real characters of the generality of clergymen from the natural judgment of mankind that virtue is peculiarly incumbent on them and from the influence of that partial virtue which is allowed by all to result naturally from our profession appeared too important to be wholly omitted because they not only are conclusive in themselves but also throw considerable light on the whole of this subjectBut the most direct proof of the tendency of our office to form us to a temper of universal virtue still remains It arises from the nature of that office  As moral causes have doubtless a very great influence on the characters of men so all professions it is allowed contain fixt moral principles which tend to produce a correspondent character and have often force enough to alter the disposition that was received from nature Now we may learn with certainty the tendency of the moral principles essential  to any profession by examining the nature of that profession its end and the proper means of promoting that end If we survey the ministerial office in this manner we shall find that it has an essential tendency to promote a virtuous temper  THE business of a minister of the gospel is in brief to teach religion The tendency of his office will therefore be altogether determined by the nature of the religion which he teaches Christianity includes all the principles of natural religion and superadds the revelation of a stupendous dispensation of Providence for the redemption and reformation of an apostate world by Jesus Christ The truths of natural theology especially as they are illustrated and refined in scripture center in this that to  fear God and keep his commandment is the whole of man  Eccles xii  The peculiar doctrines of revelation  teach us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly  Tit ii  Both are proposed in the scriptures the only rule of our teaching with an express design to form us to the love of God and of man to make us  perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works  Tit iii  Religious principles are constantly  represented as arguments for all virtue and addressed to our hopes to our fears to our gratitude to our honour to our propensity to imitation to every affection of the human heart that can have any influence on conduct At the same time in the scriptures all the parts of virtue all the duties of life are illustrated in the justest and the most practical maner Our employment is to promote the belief and the practice of this religion to recommend goodness by publishing truth to explain virtue and enforce it by all possible motives Can such employment tend to form us to any other temper than that virtue which we inculcate upon others  IT is certainly first of all requisite in a teacher that he understand the subject of his teaching and that for this purpose he study it with care Our profession will therefore naturally lead us to the diligent and constant study of all the doctrines and duties of religion it will urge us to  know the holy scrip  ▪  Tim iii  to  meditate upon them  to  give ourselves wholly to them  Tim iv  that we may be  able to teach others  Tim ii  If then religious or moral considerations if precepts or arguments if maxims of sentiments examples or rules of virtue  have really  any  force they must exert it  most  in purifying refining and exalting the tempers of those whose whole business it is to attend to them Since ministers must often think on all these that they may understand them and that they may inculcate them upon others the consequence will be that if they are like other men subject to the law of habit incitements to virtue will occur to their thoughts more easily and frequently than to the thoughts of others and urge them more powerfully to a suitable behaviour  A GREAT part of the vice with which other men are infected arises from the temptations to which they are exposed in the course of their worldly business Each of them has a temporal vocation the direct end of which does not coincide with that of their spiritual calling and which therefore sometimes leads them off from the duties of the latter But ministers of the gospel have no worldly business the nature of their office as well as the authority of scripture to which they are indispensibly obliged to submit forbids them to  entangle  themselves  with the affairs of this life  Tim ii  and by consequence preserves them while they continue in their proper province from  those temptations which produce the greatest part of the wickedness of the world Our occupation is to enforce a sense of virtue and religion upon others and every attempt of this kind is an act of virtue which tends directly to our own improvement Every effort which we make in our  particular  vocation promotes the end of our  general  calling  OUR office leads us to observe our fellowcreatures in all those situations in which either virtuous principles or the sense of vice produce the most conspicuous effects and tend most strongly to alarm a spectator and to force him to attend to the opposite natures of good and evil It introduces us for example into  the house of mourning  Eccles vii  it conducts us to the bed of death There we observe virtue supporting those who have been steddy in the practice of it under all the agonies of pain and enabling them to triumph in the prospect of their dissolution as a second birth a glorious birth into the world of pure light and immortality There we see vi  e taking fast hold of those in the hour of perplexity who have formerly eluded its painful grasp we behold the horrors of remorse and the  ghastly fears of guilt we perceive the wicked in his latest moments inheriting the unforsaken sins of his youth he looks eagerly for comfort to every side but he can find no comfort the flattering temptations which have seduced him already appear to be delusions he feels already that all which this world contains is a vain shadow that eternity alone is real and he feels the pains of hell begun already in himself if his faultering tongue should attempt to dissemble the anguish of his soul his trembling joints his beating heart his agonized and despairing look proclaim it in more striking language Is there nothing in all this by which  the heart  may be  made better  Eccles vii  Others may have some opportunities of this kind but our opportunities are so frequent that the impression made by one instance can scarce decay till it be revived and strengthened by another Must not that man be destitute of all principles of reformation who is not formed to virtue by these means  IT is our business to  instruct  Tim ii  to  convince  to  exhort  Tit i  to  charge  Tim vi  to  intreat  Tim v Tim ii  to  reprove  and to  rebuke  Ver Tim iv  others Can a vicious man be  thus employed without some secret misgivings without some inward checks without sometimes feeling the agonies of remorse And have these no tendency to excite a man to that genuine virtue which alone can keep his own heart from condemning him Can ministers allow themselves in any open and known vice and yet urge abstinence from every vice on others in public and in private in the solemn assemblies and  from house to house  Acts xx  Will it not require a degree of impudence and effrontery which is seldom to be found even in the most degenerate  MANKIND are extremely averse from labouring in vain Let an end be of over so little importance in itself yet a person who is actually engaged in the pursuit of it becomes anxious to attain it and cannot without uneasiness bear the thought of disappointment The end of our office is of the greatest importance in itself it is to form mankind to virtue We cannot promote it without being highly virtuous ourselves An  example  of vice exhibited by us will render the best  instructions ineffectual  and will lead men into vice with much  greater  fo  ce than all our exhortations have to urge them to virtue When this is  the certain consequence of wickedness in ministers must not we acknowledge either that they alone of all mankind have no concern for success and are in love with disappointment or that they have from their office a peculiar and powerful motive to be exemplarily virtuous to  shew themselves in all things patterns of good works  Tit ii    THE opinion of the world has very great often too great influence on all men Can it be supposed that it will not likewise have some influence on ministers of the gospel It sometimes leads other men astray into vice but it invariably urges ministers to the strictest virtue for every vice in them appears scandalous to all mankind and necessarily renders them  contemptible and base before all the people  Mal ii  It is not a considerable advantage that a motive so powerful as the sense of character is constantly applied to us on the side of virtue  WILL it not also have some influence on ministers of the gospel that in the opinion of the world the vices of each individual reflect dishonour on the whole order and bring the office itself into contempt Can a man consider with perfect indifference that he renders himself  an object of just indignation to thousands of worthy men of his own profession whom his vices expose to undeserved ignominy When the meanest artificer is solicitous to represent his own occupation in a favourable light can we imagine ministers so totally destitute of the most ordinary principles of human nature as to have no concern to be virtuous when that alone can prevent  the ministry  from being  blamed  Cor vi  Nay the vices of ministers have still worse effects Men impute them to religion itself and censure and di  gard it on account of them Our vices make  to  the offering of the Lord  Sam ii  they  cause many to stumble at the law  Mat ii  they cause  the name of God and his doctrine to be    they induce great numbers to  make  of their  faith  to harden themselves in their sins and to destroy their own souls Can this consideration fail to operate powerfully on every man who is not lost to all good principles  To enumerate all the peculiar inducements which the ministers of Jesus have to pure and exalted virtue were indeed to explain all the circumstances of the pastoral  From the few observations which we have made already it appears evident that that office  tends to promote virtue in those who exercise it by many moral causes essential to it and fit to work on the most universal and unquestionable principles of human nature  BUT though our office has plainly an essential and unalterable tendency to purify and refine the heart yet we will acknowledgewe reckon ourselves nowise concerned to dissemble itit highly imports us to consider it very oftenthat our profession will not form us infallibly to virtue nay that if we allow it to fail of producing this its primary and most natural effect the very circumstances which give us so many advantages for virtue will render us more deeply and more obstinately wicked than the rest of mankindBy the original constitution of our nature habit which strengthens our  active  principles weakens all  passive  impressions The more frequently we consider or feel motives to virtue without being really excited to the practice of virtue the feebler will be their influence upon us the greater our insensibility the more imminent our danger of never yielding to their force This is an alarming truth to all human creatures but to ministers of the gospel more alarming than to others We must revolve and preach the truths and duties of religion so frequently that if they do not  influence us early to sincere and stedfast virtue they must quickly become familiar and lose their power Moral and divine considerations must pass so continually through our minds that in a very short time they will make no impression on us A person whom our profession does not render virtuous will become more suddenly and more desperately obdurate in wickedness than any other man Nothing contributes more to strengthen any principle than an opposition which doth not effectually restrain it Our profession contains the most powerful inducements to virtue these will at least make a vigorous  opposition  to all vicious principles of action but if the opposition do not subdue them they will collect all their force in order to surmount it and they will be strengthened and confirmed by the violent effort As a sluice which cannot stem a torrent altogether only renders the inundation greater and greater still the longer it keeps it back just so vicious passions which are too violent to be wholly restrained by the fences that our profession raises against them will produce the most dreadful deluge of wickedness whenever their fury can break down these fences If a pastor be really vicious he will almost necessarily be singularly vicious Nothing less than a total  depravation of soul can be the effect of a man's resisting the strict obligations to virtue and abusing the signal advantages for cultivating it which the pastoral office affordsIn these and perhaps in some other ways our office may heighten vice in those who refuse to be actuated by its genuine spirit But this concession will avail our antagonists nothing Were this a sufficient proof that our office tends naturally to vice it would likewise be a proof that all consideration of our duty or of arguments for the practice of it has a natural tendency to render us vicious for it is certain that the oftener any man reflects on his duty and the stronger his sense of its obligation is if he be not really excited to the practice of it the less chance there is of his ever practising it the more hardened in vice he will become in time and the more impetuously ungoverned passions will rage within him  BOTH from the former arguments and from the survey that we have taken of the nature of our office it is plain that it tends primarily and most naturally to virtue It promotes not one virtue but a temper which disposes the mind to the culture of every virtue It is the abuse of it that leads to vice and the abuse leads so strongly to vice only because  the office itself has a powerful influence on virtue If this  general  examination of the genius of our calling be not  necessary  for vindicating it from the aspersions of our adversaries it is notwithstanding highly  proper  for producing in ourselves my reverend fathers and brethren a sense of the strength of those obligations to virtue which we lie under  PART III  WE will now enquire THIRDLY how far our office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame those particular vices which some have represented as characteristical of our order  THIS is the more necessary because the late Author to whom we have referred has unwarily admitted some fallacious principles and wrong suppositions into the reasoning by which he supports the charge These render his arguments specious and make those inducements to vice appear to arise from the original and prevailing spirit of our profession which are really but the partial effects of some of its circumstances or accidental temptations arising from the abuse of it And because these fallacies run through all the parts of his reasoning it will be proper before we examine the particular vices which he derives from the genius of our calling to make a few observations on the general method in which he traces out the tendency of that calling  IF we should allow that he  a true account of the tendency of those  in our profession which he mentions yet we might insist with reason that he has applied the character which results from them by far too generally He justly blames the undistinguished judgments of the vulgar who comprehend every individual of a nation without exception in the same national character He justly observes that all that can be asserted with truth is that some particular qualities will be more frequently met with among some classes of people than others Has he preserved this necessary caution and delicacy in determining the character of the clergy He indeed says there are exceptions I will not enquire how far he can seriously admit exceptions with respect to some particulars consistently with the manner in which his reasoning is pursued But certainly it was wrong to combine all the vices which he mentions into one character and to ascribe it to most individuals of our order The same temptation will not prevail with all but only with those to whose constitution it is adapted Every day's experience proves that that may be an irresistible temptation to one man which makes no impression on another Though therefore the genius of our calling were such as it is described it could only be inferred that some of  the vices which are enumerated will belong to one clergyman others to another but not that all these vices will be united in the temper of any considerable number The circumstances which operate on the character are so various and on that account the influence of each of them is so precarious and the turn of mind from which each derives its force is so uncertain that we ought to reason on this subject with a peculiar degree of diffidence  IT is easy to select a few circumstances in any profession which considered by themselves may appear to have an immoral tendency but we cannot thence infer that the profession hath an immoral tendency upon the whole for the influence of these may be overbalanced by other circumstances equally essential to it Were we to estimate the character which any profession forms by the separate view of some circumstances belonging to it we might represent it in a very unfavourable light The character of a soldier is reckoned so amiable by this author that he judges it the fittest to be opposed to ours in order to set off its deformity But it is a soldier's business to fight and kill at the command of his superiors without examining the justice of the causeWere it fair to attend to this circumstance alone we might say that his employment necessarily  renders him cruel arbitrary a contemner of right and an absolute pest in society Such precisely is the reasoning by which this author would prove that our office necessarily inflames many of the blackest vices of human nature He has by some oversight omitted many circumstances essential to it which have the most powerful influence on virtue he has fixed on a few circumstances some of them really foreign to our office and others of them but casually and remotely connected with it he has considered the effects which these would produce if they constituted the whole of our office and I will venture to say he has exaggerated both these effects and the causes from which they are represented as proceeding In this respect his reasoning is fallacious being built on an insufficient foundation  WHEN it appears that any circumstance in a profession viewed in one light tends to vice we cannot always conclude that even this circumstance tends to vice upon the whole because it may as naturally or more naturally produce other effects of an opposite kind It is the office of a judge to pronounce sentence exactly according to law without regard to the ties of relation to compassion or to worthiness of character By considering this circumstance in one point of view we might be  inclined to think that this office naturally banishes from the heart pity generosity friendship the love of relations and all the amiable offspring of benevolence But this will not be its natural effect for this unbiassed regard to right in opposition to all inducements from affection is fit to cherish an attachment to public happiness for promoting which all the rules of justice are calculated and by giving constant exercise to the sense of virtue it strengthens this sense and enables it to controul all vicious dispositions and to lay the mind open by this means to the operation of every generous and kind and worthy affection But this author has considered those circumstances in our profession of which he takes notice only in one point of view he has observed only some of their consequences on the character but has unluckily overlooked others more essential and important and of a perfectly contrary nature If this be true his arguments will be inconclusive and that may be but a very  partial  tendency which they would represent as the prevailing spirit of our office  THIS author begins his character of our profession by adopting a trite maxim which he says is not altogether false that  priests of all religions are the same  I think it may be  easily proved that this maxim cannot be true It necessarily supposes that the way of life and the occupation of priests of all religions is perfectly the same Different causes can produce the same or similar effects only by means of those qualities which they possess in common Every circumstance in an occupation has some influence upon the character Characters therefore perfectly uniform cannot be the result of occupations which do not coincide in all respects Politeness and the good qua  ties related to it make up the character which this author derives from the profession of a  modern  soldier He quotes a saying of an antient writer who was perfectly well acquainted with life and manners that  it is not in the power even of the gods to make a polite soldier  Yet the way of life of an  ancient  soldier included almost all the circumstances from which he derives the politeness of a  modern  soldier The very same profession therefore may produce perfectly contrary characters in different periods by means of a difference in the prevailing manners of the world It is strange that an author of uncommon penetration who had remarked in this instance that a small change in the customs of common life could even reverse the spirit of one profession should immediately after produce a maxim which supposes that the greatest change  in religious principles and customs cannot make any alteration in the character of priestsPriests being the ministers of religion must derive from their office a character correspondent to the nature of that religion in which they minister But surely the nature of  all  religions is not perfectly the same This author acknowledges in another place  Natural History of Religion p  that no two nations and scarce any two men have agreed precisely in the same religious sentiments that polytheism of every kind is most properly a sort of superstitious atheism similar to a belief of elves and fairies which it is great complaisance to dignify with the name of religion The pagan religion consisted wholly of groundless fables inconsistent traditions immoral tales insignificant ceremonies and empty pageantry  Ibid p  Could it then have the same tendency with Christianity which delivers the genuine principles of theism which institutes very few ceremonial duties which every where represents these as subservient to moral virtue which proclaims that the alone  weighty matters of the law are justice mercy fidelity and the love of God  Mat xxiii Luke xi  which sets before men the most illustrious examples of every virtue and the strongest motives to the practice of it Can a  pagan priest wholly employed in the absurd rites of the former derive  from his office  the same character to which a Christian minister will be naturally formed by teaching the doctrines and inculcating the duties of the latter What one principle almost is common to their functions  IT is plain from the most superficial view of the character which Mr  Hume  draws for Christian ministers that he avails himself of all the corruptions of character arising from the absurdities of  Popery  for blackening the clergy in general I was unwilling however to suppose that he designed to represent the character of Christian ministers derived from their office as the same with that character which  Heathen  priests would receive from their functions I took it for granted that this learned author was too well acquainted with antiquity not to know that the Pagan priesthood was established on a very different footing from the Christian ministry and that the distinction between  clergy  and  laity  was never heard of in the Heathen world Candour induced me to believe that a person who must know the purity and excellence of the religion and morality taught in the Scriptures though he may not reckon it of divine original could never entertain a thought of setting it on a level with Pagan superstition I was disposed to ascribe those passages in his writings which seemed to imply this to an excess of zeal against those corruptions of true religion which the folly and wickedness of men have too often introduced I therefore intended the observations which have been made above concerning the difference between Paganism and Christianity only for illustrating the general principle that the nature of  all  religions is not perfectly the same and that by consequence all religions cannot form precisely the same character in priests a principle which I immediately applied to prove the difference between the natural character of a Popish priest and that of a Protestant Clergyman But in a later edition of his  Essays  which did not fall in my way till after the first publication of the Sermon this author is solicitous to put it beyond doubt that he regards the Heathen priesthood and the Christian ministry as precisely the same office from which it will be a necessary consequence that Paganism and Christianity are in his opinion the very same religion He makes this addition to his character of the clergy  'Twas no bad expedient in the ROMANS for preventing the strong effect of the priestly character to make it a law that no one should be received into the Sacerdotal office till he was past fifty years of age DION  Hal  lib The living a layman till that age 'tis presumed would be able to fix the character  Any person who reads this paragraph would certainly think that  Dionysius  has asserted that  Romulus  fixed the age of priests to fifty  as an expedient for preventing the strong effect of the  same  priestly character  which is delineated by Mr  Hume  But in truth that historian does by no means represent the law of  Romulus  as an expedient for this purpose He says  While others generally chose the officers of religion in an improper manner some selling the dignity and some disposing of it by lot he would not allow the priestly office either to be sold or to be given by lot on the contrary he made a law that out of every ward two should be chosen into the priesthood above fifty years of age who excelled the rest in virtue and nobility who had a plentiful fortune and were free from every bodily defect  DION  Hal Ant Rom  lib Mr  Hume  's account of the intention of this law must therefore stand wholly on his own authority But to what does that authority amount in the present case When it is first proved that a prince who according to the account given of him by  Dionysius  bestowed his first care on the establishment of the religion with which he was acquainted who reckoned a regard to it the principal means of securing the prosperity of the nation and who made larger provision for the priesthood than the founders of any other states yet believed that religion has an unfavourable influence on good morals when it is proved that he foresaw that the priestly office tended necessarily to corrupt the character and contrived this law on purpose to counteract this tendency and to render the unavoidable corruption as  little  as possible then Mr  Hume  's account of the spirit of this law may be admitted as ingenious But till all this be proved it is a conjecture not only destitute of all plausibility but even perfectly improbableA great degree of ingenuity misguided by partiality to a favourite notion has caused Mr  Hume  to overlook the  obvious  reason of the  Roman  law The religion of  R  m  was a political institution and was constantly rendered subservient to the views of the leading men The priesthood was an high dignity in the state to which only patricians were admitted for a long time after the foundation of the city A certain age was fixed for every magistracy and the age of fifty was in like manner fixed for the priesthood that it might be bestowed only on persons who had served their country and acquired authority in it When the law in question is considereo in this natural and obvious point of view let any person determine whether it can in the least degree confirm Mr  Hume  's argument or has the remotest connection with his subject  The Protestant religion is very  different from Popery both in its form and in its spirit The office of a Popish priest is in  consequence of this very different from that of a Protestant minister The one is continually recommending imignificant ceremonies as a compensation for real goodness the other is perpetually inculcating that nothing can compensate the want of it Can these employments promote the very same turn of character It can scarce be said that priests of these two religions agree in the acknowledgment of the Scriptures for in popery the Scriptures are made void by legends and traditions But if they agree in this the only part of their  character which they can on this account derive in common from their office is either that which results from the general tendency of revelation the love of God and man or those virtues which are recommended particularly to the ministers of religion And what are these The Scripture commands them to be  apt to teach blameless holy godly vigilant sober temperate not given to wine modest of good behaviour just not covetous not strikers not brawlers not selfwilled not soon angry patient forbearing gentle meek peaceable benevolent given to hospitality lovers of good men  Tim iii Tim ii Tit i  May these ever be the qualities in which priests of all religions agree But then their character will be in every respect the reverse of what this author has drawn for themIn a word because different religions are unlike in many circumstances fit to operate on the character priests of all religions cannot be the same  IT is not very easy to determine with certainty what place the false maxim which we have mentioned really possesses in this author's reasoning whether it be one of the principles which he uses in ascertaining the tendency of  the sacerdotal office or whether it be the conclusion which he draws from circumstances supposed to belong to that office in all the various forms of religion  IF it be a principle on which the reasoning proceeds it ought to have been clearly proved before it was adopted for if it be really false or doubtful every argument built upon it is destitute of evidence however plausible it may appear to those who take the principle for granted If it be considered in this light there is but one argument produced for proving it  Priests of all religions are the same for as chymists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they be extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire an uniform character which is entirely their own  Do you think that this comparison bestows any evidence upon the maxim Is the distillation of spirits by a chemical process a case exactly similar to the forming of a character by means of religious and moral principles And is it not somewhat strange to suppose all priests elevated above humanity as a step towards proving that they are all sunk into vices which depress humanity below itself To produce this as an argument would be unworthy of this ingenious  philosopher who is well acquainted with the rules of reasoning who can easily discern the fallacy of very specious arguments who is even scrupulous in allowing men to reason from one subject to another in which the least circumstance of similarity is wanting  Essay on a particular Providence c page  It is a mere metaphor an allusion to a fact so wholly dissimilar that it has almost too much the appearance of a turn of wit to be admitted as an apposite image in the more serious kinds of poetry On this account I am inclined to think that the maxim in question was intended not for a principle in the reasoning but for the conclusion deducible from it  BUT if the author really designed to infer from the nature of our office that priests of all religions agree in the character which he describes he ought not to suppose this conclusion in determining the nature of that office This is plainly reasoning in a circle Yet many of his arguments rest on this supposition and will be inconclusive without it Could this manner of reasoning be allowed it is obvious that great advantage might be derived from it By means of it all the basest corruptions of religion come to be regarded as  essential parts of it every thing which in consequence of the corruption of religion has ever been attempted by its ministers in the most degenerate state of things for supporting or promoting that corruption comes to be represented as a necessary part of the pastoral office though it be in fact repugnant to the very nature and design of it  BUT if we would examine fairly and impartially what is the tendency of the pastoral office with respect to any virtue or vice we must distinguish the  office  itself from the  abuses  of it In order to this we must take our account of it only from the Scriptures we must consider the end for which they declare that it was appointed the employment on which they put Christian ministers for promoting that end and the rules which they prescribe concerning the manner of executing their employment An infidel cannot justly proceed in any other way for whether the Scriptures have any real authority or not it is only in them that the institution of this office or the manner of executing it is said to be contained Whatever is not by the Scriptures incumbent on a clergyman is  foreign  to his office at least and may be  inconsistent  with it however generally it be practised An enquirer must first discover in this manner what our office  really is and then he must consider all the circumstances of it together trace out all the natural effects of each balance the good and the bad effects of the same circumstance and weigh the tendencies of different circumstances against one another before he can expect to determine its genuine spirit This will be indeed a difficult and complex induction but philosophers know well that an induction equally severe is requisite before a certain conclusion can be established in subjects of a less intricate nature than the formation of human characters Whether the author whose arguments we are examining has observed this method whether in estimating our character he has not on the contrary fixed on some circumstances in our profession considered even these but in one light pointed out only some of their effects upon the character unduly exaggerated particulars and argued from circumstances foreign to the office of a Christian minister nay wholly contradictory to it I will appeal to the impartial I will appeal to his own candour after he has reviewed his arguments by the acknowledged rules of reasoning It will appear in some measure from the following examination of those vices which our office is said to have a fixt and unalterable tendency to promote▪They are  hypocrisy superstition ambition vanity  partyspirit rancour  Truly a black catalogue of the most diabolical vices Had one of us drawn such a character for the laity in general or for any particular profession would it not have been cited as an instance of  priestly fury  But destitute as we are represented to be of the noble virtues of  humanity meekness  and  moderation  we will content ourselves with submitting our cause coolly to the cognizance of reason  DO those abominable vices which have been mentioned indeed compose the genuine character of the ministers of Jesus Are these the natural result of their profession Say Christians when you look around you and observe the ministers who come within your knowledge do you really find  these  to be the qualities which are predominant in the temper and conduct of the greatest part of themWould you be disposed to give greater  indulgence  to these vices in a minister than in another Or would not your hearts condemn them as  unsuitable  to his profession If these vices resulted necessarily from our office would it not follow that mankind must be disposed to excuse  them  in ministers on account of the difficulty of their avoiding them But can our adversaries say that hypocrisy ambition pride rancour or any other vice in that horrid  catalogue by which they describe the spirit of our calling is regarded with a more favourable eye in one of us than in men of a different occupation The weak may not perceive some exertions of these principles to be vicious the prejudiced may mistake them for virtuous but whenever they are at all disapproved as wrong are not they as well as other vices condemned with singular severity in a clergyman Doth not the common sense of mankind thus declare that our office tends to promote the virtues opposite to these as well as other virtues Some vices are reckoned more indecent in a clergyman than others but  all  vices are reckoned more indecent in him than in any other man Some virtues are esteemed more indispensibly necessary than others but  every  virtue is esteemed more requisite in this profession than in other professions  THERE are two circumstances in our profession which it is said necessarily form us to  hypocrisy  One is the obligation which it lays us under to observe strict decencyDecency consists in abstaining from all behaviour that is either vicious or offensive The most natural principle of this abstinence is virtue and our office obliges us to decency only by obliging us to blameless virtue Did it exert its full influence upon our character we  should not stand in need of dissimulation in order to appear virtuous Indeed it cannot be expected in the present imperfect state that this office will exert its full influence universally or produce that exalted virtue which it demands in all who exercise it On this account many ministers may have an inducement from their profession to endeavour in particular instances to conceal vices and imperfections which really belong to them Yet still this is but a secondary tendency by which the profession cannot be fairly characterized a tendency too which reflects honour upon it because it proceeds only from the strength of its original tendency to virtueAnd is that conduct which even this secondary tendency produces absolutely blameable Can it be allowed that all reserve is criminal hypocrisy Is every man obliged in honesty to discover to others all the faults of which he is conscious in himself Is it not  right  to conceal our vices from the knowledge of others by all lawful means Will it not in some measure prevent the infection of our bad example Certainly it is not criminal for a person to endeavour to reform himself from any vice which he has contracted Yet this can be done only by setting a guard over his words and actions and abstaining from giving scope to those wrong passions which continue to  solicit him very powerfully May not a minister abstain from the practice of vices to which he is disposed from a sense of duty or from a desire to extirpate them by degrees or may not he abstain from things which he knows to be lawful in charitable indulgence to the weakness of others or from a regard to character without any fault without being liable to the charge of hypocrisy without incurring any danger of destroying the candour and ingenuity of his temper or making an irreparable breach in his character Is not the conduct rather laudableIndeed if a clergyman be obstinately wicked he will be exposed to a temptation from his office to  blameable  hypocrisy In every profession the vicious are often induced to affect an appearance of virtue in order to promote their designs The pastoral office will not render every individual really virtuous But it cannot be executed by a person who is known to be vicious It is therefore probable that a vicious minister will put on a false shew of goodness But shall the whole order be for this reason charged with affecting a continued grimace in order to support the veneration of the ignorant vulgar and promote the spirit of superstition Absurd  corruptions  of religion there have been which were intended for promoting a spirit of superstition  and which could not be supported without an implicit veneration of the priest but to argue from these is to confound the vilest perversions of religion with Christianity the basest prostitutions of the pastoral office with the office itself Where do the Scriptures enjoin a clergyman to promote a superstitious spirit The clergyman who aims at it pursues a wrong end suggested to him by his corrupt passions not by his office to which it is altogether foreign and the same corrupt passions lead him to pervert his office that it may become subservient to this end For what part of the pastoral function is the blind veneration of the ignorant vulgar requisite Indeed we cannot execute our office without being careful to deserve esteem virtue alone deserves it our office therefore prompts us strongly to virtue If any of us attempt to supply the want of virtue by affected grimace in order to procure esteem he uses unlawful means of accomplishing a lawful end he is guilty of base hypocrisy the temptation to which arises indeed from his office but arises solely from its rendering virtue necessary for the execution of it If any of us weakly mistake grimace for the genuine dignity of virtue he confounds a vice with a good quality to which it bears some general resemblance  But how does the ministerial office contribute to the mistake Do any of the duties of that office described in Scripture or does the example of our Saviour who  came cating and drinking  Matth xi  or the example of his Apostles lead into it It arises only from the weakness of men which produces similar instances of selfdeceit in all professionsWe may add that our danger of being seduced into hypocritical grimace cannot justly make the character of our order appear in a disadvantageous light when it is compared with the character of other ranks of men The weakness of our nature may render that corruption of religion and of our office from which the temptation to hypocrisy arises very frequent but the same cause will as frequently introduce dishonest views and dishonest artifices of different kinds into other professions When the pastoral office is actually perverted from its real end to promote the purposes of a corrupt religion the temptation to hypocrisy may be very strong so as actually to prevail with many of our order but the perversions of other professions afford temptations to those species of dishonesty and craft which suit them as irresistible and as universally prevalent The  hypocrisy which arises from our compliance with these temptations is highly blameable and pernicious but is not generally baser or more destructive than the various frauds and artifices which are practised by bad men in other callingsOn the whole our office leads primarily to real virtue not to an affected appearance of it it very naturally produces a grave and serious temper and a cautious attention to our deportment which may be disagreeable to the gay and dissipated and which they may uncharitably charge with hypocrisy because of its contrariety to their own manners but which is totally distinct from vicious grimace corruptions of religion may pervert our office so far as to lead us to pursue ends which cannot be accomplished without affected grimace but the temptation to it is to be imputed not to our office or to religion but to the corruption of both and to the weakness and fault of individuals and whatever degree of grimace may really prevail among the clergy it cannot justly expose them to peculiar disapprobation because many kinds of dishonest art as odious to the full as this are equally general among other ranks of men  IT is likewise said that our office promotes hypocrisy by leading us to be employed in the exercises of religion oftener than we can be possessed with the real spirit of devotionIt leads us indeed to be frequently employed in the exercises of religion The natural tendency of this is to improve a temper of piety in our souls for every habit is formed and strengthened by frequent exercise Ministers will sometimes find their devotion languid when they are called to exercise it But the more constantly an affection is exerted the stronger and more habitual it is rendered by this means the less will a person be indisposed for exerting it If therefore our office leads us to be more constant in the exercises of devotion than other men it will necessarily render us less subject than others to fits of languor They who have not originally a higher or more constant spirit of devotion than the generality of mankind will naturally acquire it by being engaged in our profession It cannot be denied that our employment has an essential and strong tendency to form us to eminent and constant piety the most necessary and the most excellent of all virtues without absurdly supposing either that frequent acts of any virtue have no tendency to promote a habit of that virtue or that the strength  of a habit has no tendency to lead us to act frequently upon itBut it is said that our office obliges us to affect devotion often when we are already jaded with the exercises of it or when our minds are engaged in worldly occupations Suppose that it sometimes called us to devotion when we are in this situation Is it necessarily unlawful to attempt to exert a good affection when a person is illdisposed to it If the attempt proceed from a sense of duty it is surely virtuous And it is remarked by philosophers  Bacon de Aug Scient lib cap  that one of the most proper seasons for exerting a principle so as to improve it is when we are worst disposed Then a strong effort will be necessary to overcome the opposition arising from our reluctance and by this effort the principle will acquire greater strength than if it had been exercised more easily  Hume's Dissert on the Passions page  When other men find themselves indisposed for devotion they may be tempted to neglect it by neglecting it they will become more indisposed and are thus in danger of becoming by degrees habitually impious but a clergyman being under a necessity from his office to exercise it is led by this means to take one of the fittest opportunities for cultivating  a temper of real pietyAs our affections arise directly from just conceptions of their objects we can seldom be so averse from the exercise of any affection that it cannot be produced by due attention to its object Our office leads us to frequent meditation on that God who is the object of devotion and on all those subjects which can render our sentiments of his perfections vigorous and lively It thus affords us the proper and direct means of rousing pious affections when they are languid And since our office thus fixes us in contemplation of God and obliges us frequently to exercise devout affections towards him we must be grossly faulty if we be at any time so illdisposed as to approach him with feigned devotion By these advantages which our profession gives us piety may be rendered so habitually predominant in our temper that it shall eagerly seize every opportunity of acting and that we shall be able to exercise sincere devotion in circumstances in which they who are seldom employed in religious duties judging of us by themselves may think it impossible and censure our worship as hypocriticalBut is there no danger that we may be contented with going the round of religious exercises without being at pains to excite the inward affections which ought to animate  them And if we should will not this produce hypocrisy Undoubtedly Mere formal worship frequently gone about tends to make us think that we are already possessed of those inward affections from which our worship should have proceeded and thus prevents our setting ourselves to cultivate them and confirms us in hypocrisy This danger arises from the very constitution of human nature and extends to all external actions which may sometimes proceed from other principles than the virtue to which they correspond and will in that case disguise our want of that virtue from us If ministers notwithstanding the peculiar advantages which their profession gives them for cultivating a temper of real piety engage in devotion without exciting that temper into act they will be in greater danger than others of becoming insensible of their want of piety and will more quickly contract a strong habit of hypocrisy by reason of their frequent calls to devotion But is this habit really worse than a want of all appearance of religion which these men would have infallibly run into from the same degeneracy of mind in any profession which did not give them frequent calls to devotion Or though it were can our profession be justly blamed for requiring those acts of devotion from the wrong performance  of which that habit springs If it could it must follow that  all  exercise of devotion is not only useless but highly dangerous Nay on this principle all good external actions must be censured as tending to corrupt the character because they may be performed when they do not proceed from their natural principle and because when they are thus performed they will rather obstruct than promote the improvement of that principleBut after all a clergyman can really be in no  peculiar  danger from the  public  exercises of religion because in them all the people profess to join and yet they alone appear to be intended by this Author He seems to have had those priests in his eye who are almost constantly employed in running over forms of devotion in a language which the people do not understand But is it fair to draw an argument from them to clergymen who by their office only preside in those exercises of devotion in which all the people are as much concerned as they He seems likewise to confound mechanical warmth and extasy which must needs be transient with calm and rational piety which may actuate the mind as habitually and uninterruptedly and be as much in readiness to exert itself whenever an occasion offers as gratitude friendship or any other affection of the human heartIn a word  our profession is singularly fit to form us to sincere and exalted piety by obliging us to frequency in those exercises of devotion by the right performance of which alone a temper of piety can be formed and by giving us great advantages for performing them aright we may indeed perform them in a wrong manner it may require strict attention to avoid it if we do not bestow this attention we may become hypocritical in our devotions but the fault will be chargeable not on our office but on ourselves who have resisted its primary and natural impulse  To conclude this head the prevailing tendency of those functions in which we are employed is to promote virtue and piety they will tempt the obstinately vicious to hypocrisy but they could not cease to tempt them to this without ceasing to urge powerfully to universal goodness Those only will become hypocrites by being engaged in our profession who would have been either dishonest or abandoned if they had followed another occupation  ANOTHER of the vices imputed to our office is  superstition  leading us to regard an appearance of religion or zeal for religious observances as a full compensation for all  vices and violations of moralityBut is there any spirit against which the Scriptures the only rule of our instructions guard mankind with greater care Can we teach the religion of  Jesus  without making it a great part of our business to warn our people against this vile perversion of devotion What circumstance can there be then in our profession that puts us in peculiar danger of superstition This Author really mentions none Instead of supporting his charge instead of attempting to prove that superstition is one of those characters which are entirely our own he observes that all mankind almost have a strong propensity to it an observation which is inconsistent with its being peculiar to the clergy Our office indeed naturally tends to form us to a temper of devotion but from the warmth of genuine devotion superstition never can arise On the contrary it is plain from the nature of the dispositions themselves as well as from the declarations of Scripture that reverence and love of God gratitude to him submission to his providence regard to his authority and to his judgment of us and all the other parts of real piety lead to universal virtue and cannot be completed without producing it All mankind appear to be sensible of this They will allow a person to be really just or temperate though some other virtues be plainly  wanting in his character But if a man want any virtue and have an appearance of piety they determine that his piety is insincere and hypocritical conscious that if it were genuine it could not fail to produce every moral virtueIf men be apt to suspect the probity of those who put on an extraordinary appearance of religion their judgment may be easily accounted for For it is too obvious to escape their notice that real piety is attended with little show and it is an observation which all men make in numberless other cases that whenever a man affects any good quality which he does not really possess he is sure to overact his partBut we need not dwell on this article of the charge for the Author instead of producing any evidence for it indulges himself in remarks which only tend to depreciate all religion by confounding it with superstition An examination of this point though it be important in itself is foreign to our present subject  THE clergy have been often accused of  ambition  and the accusation has been moulded into many different forms This Author chuses to represent them as a set of men whose ambition can be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds that by arguments drawn  from another world they may move this world at their pleasure whereas the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the interests of societyIs this a fair comparison of our character with that of others Is it not plainly a comparison of laudable ambition in them with the greatest corruption of that principle in us But is the ambition of other men always of the praiseworthy kind Is it this that has prompted individuals to raise themselves by supplanting better men by fraud by perfidy by assassinations by every the most shocking crime Is it this that has distacted kingdoms with faction and rebellion and filled the world with war and bloodshed Will it be said that the ambition of the laity has never appeared in this form or produced these effects And is not this the form of it which ought in just argument to have been opposed to wrongturned ambition in a clergyman On the other hand will it be asserted that our office does not suggest to us a laudable object of ambition which will bear to be compared with the desires of others to serve mankind by excelling in their own professions Our office brethren  naturally  proposes to us only one object of ambition the noblest indeed that can be proposed to be  workers together with  God and with Christ  in recommending  righteousness  to mankind  Cor v chap vi  and thus promoting the most valuable interests of society It is the  direct  end of our office to excite mankind by the discoveries of a future world which reason and revelation make to that conduct which alone can promote their true happiness both in time and in eternity If we misapply these engines to move men at our pleasure or to render them subservient to our designs we basely deviate from the end of our vocation and instead of it pursue an opposite and unworthy and pernicious end And shall that be imputed to our office which is contradictory to its whole designBut may not our office contribute in some way to this conduct Most men are prone to prefer present and temporal to spiritual and eternal objects and to pursue them by whatever means they can Many who were not of our order have often prostituted religion by making it a tool for promoting their secular ends The vice is not therefore peculiar to our order To be employed in the functions of our office will never lead a man to form these worldly designs which can be accomplished by a prostitution of religion these are suggested by the viciousness of his own temper  or by his being engaged in foreign occupations and would not probably have been formed if he had confined himself to his proper business Indeed when ambitious views are from these causes once formed by a clergyman he will endeavour to promote them by those religious instruments which his office affords more readily than by any others because they are most directly in his eye His office obliges him to apply them to the most glorious purpose this is an argument for its excellence his wickedness prompts him to misapply them to bad purposes this is wholly his own fault Ought the world to have been deprived of the only means by which virtue and happiness can be obtained because the abuse of them may sometimes be pernicious This vice cannot therefore justly be imputed to the genius of our calling for it has no primary or essential tendency to promote it on the contrary it has a very remote indirect and accidental influence upon it it will supply a temptation to it very seldom never except by reason of the previous corruption either of individuals or of the spirit of religion the vice will not be generally characteristical of our order except in the most degenerate state of things on this account and likewise because ambition often assumes the same form in the rest of mankind and because other  forms of it are equally detestable and pernicious particular instances of clergymen applying religion to selfish or worldly purposes cannot with any reason render the character of the profession peculiarly odiousIf we promote ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds for any end we use the most unjustifiable means But it is impossible that our office can in the remotest manner prompt us to use them The method by which its genuine end can be promoted is the  manifestation of the truth  Cor iv  our business is  rightly to divide the word of truth  Tim ii  to all to diffuse religious and moral knowledge to the utmost of our power Is this the same with promoting ignorance and error Say all the world is it not perfectly the reverse Our office tends so directly to make us  apt to teach  Tim iii Tim ii  that it cannot even afford a temptation to the conduct of which we are accused till it be first perverted to the very opposite of what it ought to be It cannot put it in our power to pursue this conduct except all the rest of mankind be in one way or another as degenerate as ourselvesWhat then could lead a person to charge our office with a tendency absolutely contradictory  to its genuine spirit There is one religion the priests of which pursue this unnatural conduct Christianity was gradually corrupted from its genuine purity during several ages of ignorance and barbarity by a mixture of the grossest absurdities of Paganism The monstrous medley could not bear examination and therefore the priests of the  Romish  church betook themselves to the only means by which it could be protected from contempt or indignation But is it candid to transfer their character to other Christian ministers whose conduct is avowedly the contraryThis were to take it for granted that priests of all religions are the same not only  without  evidence but really in  contradiction  to the evidence of actual experience This character sprung not from the office of teaching religion but from men's having ceased to teach true religion it can be ascribed only to those causes which produced the corruption of religion and by that means necessarily changed the business of the sacred function and reversed the natural character of the clergy  IT is affirmed likewise that we lie under a peculiar temptation from our office to  vanity  and an overweening conceit of ourselves because we are regarded with veneration and are even deemed sacred by the ignorant multitude  There are few situations from which men may not take occasion from criminal vanity for there are few which do not give persons some real or imaginary advantage and every opinion of advantage however trivial  may  produce an high conceit of ourselves But the more important or the more exalted any station is the stronger its temptations to this vice Our office has plainly very considerable dignity the provinces of the philosopher and the orator are united in it it is designed for the noblest end for training men to virtue and fitting them for eternal happiness It is by its excellence alone that it leads us to set a value on ourselves and it has this tendency in common with every thing which has any degree of worthBut it is not every kind of selfesteem that can be reckoned faulty A just sense of any real and important advantage is not blamed in others and cannot be blameable in us It must be owned however that all men are very prone to an excess of pride and very ready to express it in an improper manner Vanity ostentation arrogance insolence are highly censurable both in ministers and in others But the censure is due solely to the individuals who abuse the advantages of their situation to foster these vices in their souls The fault will be peculiarly chargeable on individuals in our profession  because it gives us strong inducements to avoid it The very dignity of our office will fill a man of an ingenuous spirit with deep humility when he compares it with his own unworthiness  Who is sufficient for these things  Cor ii  Its functions will lead us to fix our thoughts often on the majesty of the divine nature and when we think of it  what is man  and what is  the son of man  Psal viii  And can we always avoid reflecting that the humble and  lowly Jesus  Mat xi  is our founder If we cannot will not his example have some tendency to form  this mind in us which was also in him  Philip ii  The principle of sympathy is very powerful By means of it we enter into all the sentiments of others The good opinion of the world cannot fail to have a considerable influence on our judgment of ourselves But have ministers of the gospel any peculiar security for veneration or respect It is plain that many professions are in the general estimation of the world more reputable than theirs It will be difficult to point out any set of men on whom greater reproach and contempt has been poured out  for their works sake  than the teachers of religion Undistinguished reflections on this order are thrown out without  reserve and hearkened to with pleasure by many who would regard general censures of any other body in the gross as an evidence of prejudice and illbreeding If therefore general reproach and ridicule have any tendency to mortify the vanity of mankind the clergy at least in the present age are furnished with a peculiar antidote against vanityAll the veneration which we can expect on account of our office it is insinuated is that of the ignorant multitude We will not complain of the unjust severity of this infinuation we hope that our profession may give us a right while we maintain a character becoming it to the respect of the most knowing It will prompt us more  to vanity by this means but if we allow that passion to have any other effect than to give us a new reason for endeavouring to deserve their esteem it will be wholly our own fault If we cannot expect the esteem of the discerning we can scarce have an irresistible temptation to vanity from the veneration of the ignorant except we be formed very differently from all other men who are most apt to be elated with the approbation of the most knowing judges And truly in the present age we cannot certainly obtain the veneration even of the ignorant they who oppose religion or inveigh against its ministers are formidable rivals to us These  are not generally like this Author His infidelity will probably rob him of some part of the attention and regard which his philosophical genius and taste would have otherwise commanded from the curious and intelligent But almost all the rest owe their reputation solely to their irreligion and must have been neglected or contemned even by the most ignorant and careless reader if they had attempted to write on any other subject  PART IV  OUR office is also censured because it leads us to bear a  great regard  to the members of our own profession and to have a  particular concern  for the interests of our own bodyBut can this be culpable Because our power to do good is very limited because our beneficence would become useless if it were dissipated equally among all mankind God has wisely formed our constitution in such a manner that benevolence rises in very different degrees towards different persons The human heart is so strongly turned to love that we eagerly take occasion for exercising a peculiar degree of this affection not only from relation personal qualities or favours received but also from more trivial circumstances a name a neighbourhood or the like This constitution of nature necesse  ily leads men to love those of their own profes  n and to be concerned for the interest of the society to which they belong Was this ever before censured as vicious To neglect this were highly blameable It is chiefly by particular kind affections that men are linked together in society  If the interests of clergymen of the same religion be really united more closely than the interests of those of other professions our office has a direct tendency by this circumstance to prompt us strongly to one species of benevolence and public spirit and thus is peculiarly fit to promote one of the most amiable virtues The interests of men of other professions not only are  distinct  because each carries on his business apart but often  interfere  and by this means the love which they ought to bear to one another is extinguished Ought it not to be mentioned to the honour of our profession instead of being objected to it as a reproach that it does not expose us to this dangerAll particular attachments may indeed be carried too far and obstruct the exercise of other social virtues love to a family may render a man negligent of the good of his country even patriotism may make a man too carcless about the interests of the kind But is that constitution of our nature which makes us capable of these attachments to be blamed on this account In like manner if some clergymen pervert that just benevolence which they owe to their society into a narrow partyspirit disposing them to sacrifice the interests of the laity or leading them to aim at the support of their own peculiar tenets or at the suppression of antagonists instead of the  real  interest of the order which always coincides with the interest of truth and virtue and by consequence with the interest of mankind is the office to be therefore censured It gives occasion to this misconduct only by containing a circumstance which has a direct tendency to promote an amiable virtue but which is capable of being abused by the folly or perverseness of menAt the same time our office tends strongly to prevent the abuses which might arise from an excessive attachment to our own society We teach a religion which represents us and all mankind as connected together by every endearing relation which can excite the tenderest love and by every similarity of condition which can improve our love by sympathy and fellowfeeling Our office sets frequently in our view the general connexions of the children of men and it unites us with mankind by peculiar ties It interests us in their most important concerns it engages us in the most affectionate intercourse with their very souls Benevolence can be cherished only by those exercises of beneficence for which the circumstances of men give opportunity A minister has all the same opportunities of doing good with another man and if he really execute his office he must have many opportunities peculiar to himself for he can seldom spend a  day without being led to inform the ignorant to comfort the distressed to confirm the wavering to cultivate the seeds of goodness in the minds of men Such employment is certainly fit to melt the heart into love and to make it to overflow in streams of goodwill to the whole human raceWhen this Author represented the clergy as a separate body wholly unconnected with society I am apt to think that he had in his eye only one set of clergymen those priests whom the law of celibacy and a monastic life cut off from all the ordinary relations to mankind Indeed they are scarce a part of society they have an  independent  interest by which they are firmly united among themselves by which they are often prompted to conspire in opposing the interest of society and for promoting which their religion is evidently framed But is it fair to ascribe a character which springs from  peculiarities  in their situation to clergymen of other professions who are joined with society by all the same tender charities as other men To speak the truth by means of these the interest of individual clergymen is so much interwoven with that of the rest of mankind or so much dependent on their favour that they are in considerable danger of bearing too  little  regard to the members of their own body and of becoming the tools of the laity in promoting  designs which a concern for the interests of their own society  ought  to urge them to oppose  IN the last place the spirit of our profession is said to promote  impatience of contradiction bigoted rancour bitterness  and  fury against antagonists  When we consider brethren the genius of the Christian religion as it is delineated in Scripture we can scarce expect to find this vice among either the ministers or the professors of it for it is indeed  the gospel of peace  Rom x  its  end is charity  Tim i  its  spirit  is moderation and forbearance  Luke ix  it is wholly designed to root out of the hearts of men  all bitterness wrath anger clamour evil speaking malice  and to make them  kind tenderhearted forgiving loving  and benevolent  Eph iv chap v  Is it pos  ible that the teachers of this religion can derive from their office a perfectly contrary spirit If this office do not tend to sweeten the temper and to give peculiar advantages for meekness moderation and humanity it will be difficult to say what are the proper means of cultivating these noble virtuesThe character and the office of a Christian minister are described in Scripture as perfectly suitable to the benign  spirit of his religion  The servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing them that oppose themselves  Tim ii    reproving rebuking exhorting with all  LONGSUFFERING  and d  ctrine  Chap iv  This employment is so far from  ing to the least degree of malevolence or wrath that it cannot be executed aright if we give any scope to this dispositionBut when we attend to the history of the Christian church we find it in contradiction to the spirit of the gospel filled with fierce contentions often about trifles producing angry zeal and cruel persecutions on account of religious differences Had these things been peculiar to the clergy we might have regarded a temper of blind zeal as a vice to which our profession lays us under peculiar temptations intended for our trial which it will require our utmost vigilance to avoid complying with Yet even in this case we should have been able to evince that they are temptations which reflect no real dishonour on the pastoral office because they arise from a  perversion  of it But indeed a spirit of bitter zeal has not been peculiar to the clergy it has infected all ranks among the laity in almost every age of the Christian church What has been the cause of this  And does not it affect the credit of the gospel itselfIn order to answer these questions we may observe that Christianity as it is exhibited in the Scriptures is a system not of curious speculations or intricate disputes but of plain and simple facts fit to affect the heart and influence the practice It is proposed not with a view to exercise the ingenuity of men but expressly as  a doctrine according to godliness  and it is represented in that manner which fits it most for promoting this important end As the principles or common sense which the powerful hand of the God of nature has impressed indelibly upon the human soul influence the actions of those who have never made them an object of reflection or enquiry in ordinary life so the principles of true religion which the same God has revealed in the gospel firmly embraced and thoroughly digested will exert their full force upon the religious and moral conduct of those who are no wise qualified to answer all the difficulties or even to comprehend all the abstruse questions that may be raised in relation to them But men are prone to refinement on every subject to nice disquisitions concerning the manner of things and to contentions with those who receive not their theories or advance others repugnant to them Even the most obvious and irresistible dictates of common  sense have been called in question by the subtlety of philosophers and had nature left it in our power not to act upon them till these disputes were determined the most necessary functions of life would have been suspended and immediate ruin would have ensued Now brethren the Christian religion has been treated like every thing else it has been made a subject of endless cavil and disputation Men have set themselves to refine upon its simple tenets and instead of representing it in a manner fit to operate upon the principles of action they have reduced theology to a system of subtle controversies We are so prone to disputation that the greatest ignorance to which mankind can be reduced does not prevent it altogether But the introduction of this evil into religion was immensely forwarded by the universal authority obtained by that system of philosophy which  Aristotle  had established in declared opposition to all his predecessors and which in conformity to the spirit of its Author was wholly calculated for wrangling and altercation and absolutely intolerant to all who opposed it The spirit of this false philosophy diffused itself over religion as well as over every other subject filled it with innumerable subtle questions and by this means rendered it unfit to influence the practice for the manner  of representing any doctrine with a view to guard it studiously against the cavils of adversaries will ever be very different from the manner in which it must be represented in order to move the heart A system of principles of any kind which spends itself in disputes must be barren of works and useless with respect to practice It can produce only contentions with all the fierce passions that must needs attend them Thus Christianity has been perverted by a false philosophy from its real nature and design and from this perversion have arisen religious heats and animosities and a bitter and persecuting spirit  THE Apostles foresaw this depravation of religion and put both ministers and people on their guard against it warning them to  beware lest any man  should  spoil  them  through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ  Col ii  not to  give heed to fables which minister questions rather than godly edifying  Tim i  to  avoid foolish and unlearned questions knowing that they engender strifes and contentions  and  are unprofitable and vain  Tim ii Tit iii  And the Apostle  Paul  intimates plainly that they  consent not to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine  which is according to godliness  who  dote about questions and logomachies whereof cometh envy strifes railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds  Tim vi  But Christians have not been so wise as to regard these warnings They have deviated from the spirit of the gospel they have corrupted it into a disputatious theology by foreign mixtures and hence malevolent passions have arisen But can they be imputed to the spirit of the gospel when they have been introduced by men's contradicting its spirit Can we be infected with them by teaching the gospel when their cause is plainly teaching something else instead of the gospel They are a gross abuse of the gospel But there is nothing incapable of being abused They have been very frequent in the Christian church Perhaps God permitted them for the exercise and probation of Christians that as they have much greater advantages than other men they might likewise have some peculiar temptationsWhen  religious  disputes arise they will naturally be managed with greater warmth than questions on other subjects by reason of their superior importance and the conviction of each party that their sentiments alone are agreeable to the will of God But this warmth will not be peculiar  to the clergy the people will engage in the dispute with equal acrimony If there be instances in which the clergy have inflamed the people it is certain too that in some instances the clergy have been urged to fiery zeal by the art of designing laymen and that in some instances they have laboured to curb the fury and to cure the bigotry of the people by illustrating and enforcing the principles of toleration and free enquiry Nay uncommon ardor seizes not the friends of religion alone in questions where it is concerned but the opposers of religion likewise Warmed with the moment of the subject they too urge their arguments without a strict regard to the rules of moderation Is not the Author to whom we have so often referred an example of it Would he have reasoned on any other subject in the manner in which he has reasoned concerning the character of the ministers of religion Had he been perfectly free from that zeal which he imputes to us and from the prejudice which it occasions I am persuaded that his benevolence of heart would have rejected with indignation the general reflexions which he has thrown out against the clergy and that his strength of understanding would have enabled him to perceive that they prove nothing to the disadvantage of the pastoral office or of the  Christian religion Wrongturned zeal has sometimes excited the clergy to call in the assistance of the secular arm for the suppression of their antagonists is not this Author do you think under the influence of some degree of the same spirit when in imitation of their conduct he endeavours to alarm society against the attempts of the body of the clergy as necessarily factious ambitious and persecutingThus the  odium theologicum  is not peculiar to priests it arises not from the particular genius of their calling the corrupt passions of all men often take occasion from the importance of religion to inflame it in questions where religion is anywise concerned Fully convinced of the truth of their own opinions they are too apt to indulge intemperate zeal under the appearance of the love of truthBut have clergymen no temptations to this vice from which other men are free Perhaps they have If religion be already perverted if the credit of peculiar tenets be substituted in the place of the interests of religion which always coincide with the interests of virtue they will in that situation but only in that have a temptation to support their peculiar tenets with intemperate zeal because their own credit and their livelihood will depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with But could either depend so much on this if the people  were not fired with a bigoted attachment to certain peculiar tenets and disposed to desert or persecute their teachers when they differ from them Into the corruption of the people therefore that temptation must in some measure be ultimately resolved which on a superficial view seems to arise from the pastoral office In truth religion is first corrupted through the weakness or wickedness of men this corruption enters into the characters of all who profess it both together pervert the pastoral office from its genuine spirit and the perversion of it increases that corruption from which it sprungIf a man enter into the pastoral office fired with a spirit of disputation or wrong turned zeal the fault is chargeable only on his natural temper or his education But if he enter into it without this spirit the office will give him some advantages for avoiding it It is acknowledged that in other subjects an acquaintance with the various opinions of learned men and with the arguments by which each supports his own tends to secure a man from unreasonable dogmatism If it has the same tendency in religion a clergyman must have an inducement to moderation from his office His office leads him also to study the Scriptures in which meekness and all the kindred virtues are enforced by every method by examples by precepts by promises  and their opposite vices are exposed prohibited and severely threatened and this surely has some tendency to sweeten the temper and humanize the heartIn a word my brethren a spirit of bitter zeal springs not from religion nor from the office of the teachers of religion but from a corruption of both from a corruption however to which human nature is so prone that it will require the greatest vigilance both of ministers and of the people to preserve themselves from its infection  Mr HUME far from discovering the fallacies of that reasoning which induced him to draw so disagreeable a character of the clergy or from softening that character on mature reflexion which it had not been unreasonable to expect from his judgment and candour has thought proper in the last edition of his  Essays  to add  revenge  to the catalogue of vices with which he charges them  Revenge says he is a very natural passion to mankind but seems to reign with the greatest force in priests and women because being deprived of the immediate exertion of anger in violence and combat they are apt to fancy themselves despised on that account and their pride supports their vindictive disposition  I do not imagine that the Author intends to throw any reflection on women by joining them with priests in this character he rather intends to bestow plausibility on his charge against the clergy by bringing that charge at the same time against women  A woman's revenge  has become a proverb among those who are desirous to propagate a disadvantageous character of that sex An unwary reader finding priests classed with women may take it for granted that a vindictive temper is ascribed likewise to priests by some trite maxim and the supposed authority of that maxim will render him less ready to enquire whether it be justly ascribed to them But the assertion that revenge reigns with peculiar force in priests is by no means evidently true It has never so far as I know passed into a common saying it is not here supported by any comparison of their condact with that of others in particular instances and it would be very easy to shew that revenge has been as frequent and as impl  cable in men of other professions as in clergymenBut as this Author only infers the matter of fact by reasoning from a circumstance in the situation of the clergy his charge can claim no degree of probability except what it derives from the force of that reasoning He lays the charge it must be owned with an uncommon diffidence he had asserted boldly that the other vices  are  characteristical of the clergy but he only says that this  seems  to belong to them Yet his reasoning has not strength enough to bestow even the  appearance  of truth on his assertion It will be found on the most superficial examination to be as weak as any argument which ever dropt from so able a philosopher What is the reason why revenge is strongest in prie  s and women It is because they are deprived of the immediate exertion of anger in violence and combat It has hitherto been the unanimous opinion of philosophers and the experience of all ages has seemed to confirm it that the indulgence and  exertion  of any passion tends to strengthen it and to render it habitual and that  abstinence  from the e  ertion of it tends to weaken it and can even we  r out by degrees the most rooted habit of any vicious passion In consequence of these acknowledged principles all men would be apt to conclude that priests and women  being deprived of the exertion of anger in violence and combat  this passion in all its forms must be weakened in them more than in others But this author has discovered it seems that all this is perfectly the reverse of truth If to be restrained from the exertion of anger has really as he affirms it has a tendency to cherish a temper of revenge it will necessarily  ol+low that the only proper method of weakening any passion is to exert it upon all occasions and to satiate it with indulgence and that abstinence from such exertion will infallibly strengthen it Thus all the received maxims and rules of conduct will be perfectly inverted Repe  ted acts must  weaken  every habit A modest  oman must a  quire very strong sensual passions for she is  deprived of the exertion of them  and a common prostitute must have extremely weak desires A temperate man must have a violent and constant craving  or liquor while the greatest drunkards have the least appeti  e for it Such are the necessary consequences of this author's reasoningBut what is that particular ex  rtion of anger of which priests and women are deprived The author seems to mean that they are excluded from the privilege of  duelling  Truly priests have not been always excluded from it When duels were first introduced by the  Goths  and  Vandals  churchmen were admitted to them and many instances of priests engaged in single combat are recorded in history Duelling has been generally condemned by considerate persons it has been supported by corrupt  fashion  in opposition to  reason  attempts have been sometimes made to palliate or extenuate its folly and its guilt but few have gone so far as to endeavour to prove that it is altogether innocent This author's reasoning however if it were just would prove it to be not only  innocent  but likewise highly  useful  On his principles it must be a powerful and absolutely necessary means of moral culture it alone can prevent a vindictive temper all who are excluded from it must become a prey to inveterate revenge Strange that they alone should be deemed placable and forgiving who scruple not to avenge the smallest appearance of offence with the death of the offender that a savage custom unknown to the politest nations of antiquity decried by all wise men introduced in the most barbarous times on purpose to  execute  and  satisfy  revenge should notwithstanding be the only effectual instrument of  extinguishing  revenge If we will not avow these consequences we must admit that this author's reasoning is fallacious and that his conclusion ought to have been the opposite of what it is but these consequences who will avow But it is not only by preventing the exertion of anger that the  r being excluded from violence and combat makes revenge to reign with greatest  or  e in pr  ests and women The Author adds The  are apt to fancy themselve  pi  ed on that account and  heir pride supports their vindictive di  position We readily  nowledge that pride supports any  ssion with which it happen  to coincide But though we should allow that pride will be excited in this case yet it has an opposite force to combat We must be of opinion notwithstanding Mr  Hums  's authority that abstinence from the exertion of anger has really a tendency to weaken anger Pride must there  ore have not  some  tendency only to support and strengthen anger but a  greater  tendency to strengthen it than abstinence has to weaken it before it can produce the effect which is here ascribed to it There will however be no occa  ion to balance nicely these contrary forces against each other for pride can scarce have any concern in the matter Before price can be engaged pers  n  must really fancy that they are despised on account of their being excluded from the privilege of combat But combat must be very universal before any person can apprehend contempt on this account it can happen only when all except priests and women are forward to ins  lt and challenge and when all are moreover either b  u  es or coward  for such only will att  k th  se who are known to be unarmed and defenceless In  ru  ho  ever a very small proportion of mankind ever think of e  er  ing their anger in single combat The far greate  pa  t t  r  re c  have no prope  ity to despise those who are exc  ded from it but all who from any motives abstain from combat must be as apt as priests and women to fancy themselves despised to find their pride alarmed and by consequence must be as much subject to a vind  ctive temper In a word pr  and w  en run no peculiar risk of the contempt to which this au  hor pronounces them exposed their pride therefore cannot be n  urally roused by their situation in order to support reveng  wi  out its being roused their being deprived in the words of the  Essay of the immediate exertion of anger  will rather  bstruct  n promote a vindictive disposition they will escape this disposition except more powerful causes than those which are here assigned contribute to produce it and till much stronger evidence of the charge be produced than any which arises from this Author's reasoning the voice of mankind will acquit them from any peculiar degree of a revengeful temper    I HOPE it is by this time evident that this Author has hastily thrown off a portrait  for the ministers of religion which does by no means express their genuine features and  that the charge which he brings against the spirit of our office has been rendered in any  degree plausible only by fixing on some separate circumstances of our profession by omitting some of their most natural effects upon the character and by exaggerating the rest nay by ascribing circumstances to our office which are not only foreign but even repugnant to it by confounding the temptations which may arise from the corruptions of it or of the gospel with the direct and essential tendency of both and by comparing the highest degree of the vices to which these temptations may solicit us with the lowest degree of the vices into which other men may be led by their particular situation If the vices to which clergymen are most exposed be compared with the same degree of the vices to which men of other professions are liable the former will not appear to be more odious than the latter It cannot be pretended that the peculiar temptations of the pastoral office are more generally complied with than the common temptations of our earthly state or the peculiar temptations of other professions There is therefore no reason for representing the character of the clergy as peculiarly disagreeable in comparison with other characters There is still less reason  for censuring the spirit of our office or the gospel by which it is instituted In the preceding enquiry we have not dissembled any real temptation to the vices charged upon us which can arise from our profession But it has appeared that whatever these temptations be they arise from it only  secondarily  and  indirectly  from the corruptions of our office not from the office itself whose  primary  and  prevailing  tendency is only to virtue It has appeared that if our functions be performed aright they will naturally and strongly promote sincere and manly piety completed by universal virtue and will lead to warm and diffusive benevolence fit not only to check all angry passions and all designs hurtful to mankind but to prompt us likewise to uninterrupted assiduity in producing the happiness of others by instilling the most important knowledge and recommending the purest virtue  IF this be the character which the ministerial office tends to form in the several individuals of our society it will be unnecessary to prove by any additional arguments that no government can have reason to dread the attempts of the society itself while its members retain the true spirit of their profession As long as they are actuated by it they must agree in considering all mankind as united into one  great society under the supreme government of God and in regarding themselves as members of this system connected with all the parts of it employed to promote the order and enforce the laws of this most antient and universal polity by doing their utmost to render all to whom their influence can reach wise and virtuous and happy They must totally apostatize from this spirit before they can form themselves into a  faction  eager to establish any separate interest any interest distinct from that of truth goodness and mankind They must contract a spirit  opposite  to that which results from the  true  genius of their calling before they can concur in giving scope to  ambition pride  or a  persecuting spirit  Society can have no reason to be more jealous of their attempts than of the attempts of any other class of men for they are not more apt to degenerate from the virtuous spirit of their profession and to promote faction or persecution than other men are to become vicious and to form designs and to pursue measures equally destructive of the peace and order of civil government A peculiar jealousy of the clergy and a desire to depress them will always indicate a prevailing corruption of manners a disaffection to religion an indifference about the practice of real virtue and about the eternal happiness of  mankind in the societies or individuals who entertain that jealousy  IT was remarked in the beginning of this discourse that the enquiry which we proposed for the subject of it is of a very practical nature It suggests important instructions both to  ministers  and to the  people  EVERY part of the investigation now attempted forces reflections into our view which merit the attention of all the ministers of the gospel It shows us my reverend fathers and brethren both the  advantages  and the  difficulties  of our situation both the strong  obligations  to virtue which we lie under and the dangerous  temptations  to vice to which we are exposed By exhibiting the former it urges us  seeing we have this ministry not to faint  Cor iv  till we have attained that blameless holiness which is so strictly incumbent on us By discovering the latter it warns us to  take heed to ourselves  Tim iv  with the most constant vigilance lest we be seduced by them  THE  office of a Bishop  is indeed  a good  a worthy  work  Chap iii  It has the strongest tendency to adorn the characters of those who exercise it with  universal holiness the true beauty the only excellence of the human soul It gives us the noblest opportunities of saving ourselves by doing all that we can to promote the salvation of others The advantages which we enjoy demand from us the purest and the sublimest virtue The voice of mankind the nature of our office the credit of our religion call upon us to guard carefully against every sin and to study to excell others in every amiable quality In gratitude in duty in interest in honour by every possible tie we are indispensibly obliged to be  blameless  to have our souls deeply tinctured with all real goodness and to render our whole lives an uninterrupted series of conspicuous holiness Every degree of vice in us is singularly atrocious not only in the opinion of the world but in the eye of unbiassed reason and in the unerring judgment of God and will be punished with the greatest severity and what would be esteemed only a defect of virtue in others will ever be accounted a positive and heinous vice in us In vain shall any minister of the gospel expect to derive esteem from the dignity of his calling if he do not walk worthy of it Its dignity arises from its holiness A vicious minister will debase it more in the opinion of the world than all the groundless censures of its enemies Nay brethren to our vices their reflections may justly be imputed  for our vices alone put it in their power to censure the genius of our profession to revile our order or to blaspheme the gospel for our sakes our vices alone dispose mankind to listen in any degree to their aspersions or hinder them from rejecting them with indignation  BY improving the advantages which our occupation gives us we may with the assistance of God which will never be wanting to us but through our own fault attain the highest degree of virtue but by misimproving them we shall sink into the lowest degeneracy As meat which is extremely nourishing to the healthful may inflame dangerous distempers in the weak so advantages for cultivating virtue which have the most powerful influence on the welldisposed will contribute to harden the wicked in their vices The danger of our falling short of that exalted virtue which our advantages render indispensible and the danger of our perishing for ever which will necessarily spring from our falling short of it have appeared so great to many pious persons of our profession that they have not scrupled to express their fears that a smaller proportion of our order than of other ranks of men shall obtain salvation Certainly we cannot be too careful to impress upon ourselves the deepest sense of both these dangers which the strictness  of our obligations and our signal advantages render very great It is infinitely hazardous for a vicious man to enter into the pastoral office it is infinitely hazardous for us to neglect the immediate application of its advantages to the improvement of our own hearts for if the peculiar means of holiness which it affords do not very quickly excite the ministers of the gospel to virtue there is scarce a chance for their reformation Where can they find means of reformation more efficacious than those with which they have already refused to comply It is of great importance that every person who aspires to this sacred office should devote himself early to piety and virtue that he may be qualified to improve its opportunities and to avoid its dangers It is of everlasting importance to his own soul Every man who finds himself destitute of the seeds of exalted and uniform goodness ought to relinquish all thoughts of engaging in a profession to which his vices of whatever kind they are will be a reproach and ignominy Whoever has entered into the pastoral office ought to give up himself to the practice of its duties and as much as possible to confine himself to them that he may not lose the advantages for cultivating virtue which this office puts in his power He ought to be extremely attentive to the manner in which he  exercises his sacred functions that he may avoid the heinous vice which will infallibly arise from the negligent or the improper exercise of them and attain that improvement of heart which will be promoted by the diligent and right performance of the duties of his holy calling  SOME vices as intemperance impiety excessive dissipation are so unsuitable to our profession that they will be indulged only by the abandoned they demoustrate a total depravation of heart a mind lost to all the principles of goodness In the most degenerate state of things these vices will not be very frequent in our society the least approach to them is universally reckoned scandalous We should guard against these because they will infallibly render our characters odious and all our labours useless However slightly they may be disapproved in others let us remember not only that they are highly blameable in their own nature but also that the world will ever regard them with indignation in a clergyman that even the perverted judgement of those who practise them will pronounce them detestible in him that even they who solicit him to commit them and seem to like his gaiety will despise him in their hearts Let not the example or corrupted sentiments of the world let  not an affectation of spirit and freedom let not the fear of being reckoned austere morose or stubborn let not any inducement prevail with us to admit the lowest degree of these vices into our character or practice The virtues opposite to these are absolutely necessary to preserve us from universal infamy let us take care that we have not the appearance of them only but that we really possess the virtues themselves and excell in them They are enforced upon us by the spirit of our profession in its full strength they are inculcated by  all  the moral principles by which our employment operates on the temper  THERE are some other vices which have not so  manifest  a repugnance to our profession or which may even appear to spring from a common and probable abuse of it But for that very reason we have greater need to be upon our guard against them Intemperate zeal and its kindred vices will insinuate themselves more imperceptibly than those which were mentioned before will disguise themselves more artfully will more easily elude the observation of the ignorant or perhaps will be even consecrated by them In general the vices which we are in greatest danger of indulging are those which admit of the fairest pretexts and which are most apt to be confounded with  some virtuous principle our profession does not afford all the motives to abstinence from these which it affords to abstinence from other vices though it affords all that their nature will allow If we attend to the exhortations which the inspired writers address to ministers of the gospel we shall find that they much oftener give us warning against the vices of this c  ass than against others thus plainly intimating that we are obnoxious chiefly to these To avoid every degree of these will require the greatest circumspection These will be more frequent in our society than other vices These alone can with any  plausibility  be charged on the spirit of our office If we indulge ourselves in these their prevalence will furnish our more discerning enemies with the most specious arguments against us Instead of entertaining resentment against them let us turn their censures to our own advantage The ministerial office has not such a tendency to any vice as can justly expose its spirit to reproach but the vices which are imputed to it may notwithstanding be those which a wicked or a careless minister will most probably indulge Let us not be satisfied with a conviction that our  office  does not deserve censure but let every individual take care that  he  may not  it Adversaries of penetration will be sure to attack us on the side where we are  weakest Let us take warning let us employ particular attention there let us beware of every thing that can lead us into the vices which they impute to us Our office has its peculiar temptations let us not disguise them from ourselves let us rather be solicitous to discover them they cannot reflect dishonour on that office or on religion yet they may sometimes put our virtue to a very difficult and hazardous trial they will overcome us and seduce us into vice if we be not vigilant and circumspect But if through the grace of God whom we serve in the gospel we strenuously resist them we shall acquire strong habits of sincere piety unfeigned humility diffusive benevolence meekness gentleness charity and every amiable virtue which can adorn our station or our religion  THE enquiry in which we have been engaged likewise suggests useful instructions to the laity  IN the present age and in this nation infidelity has erected its standard and many have enlisted in its service If there be any among these who think that they have rejected the gospel after a fair examination of its evidences we will pray fervently to God that he may have mercy upon them and bring them  to the  knowledge of the truth  Tim ii  We will beseech them for their own sakes to take care that they have been really  unprejudiced  in their enquiries Prejudices  against  religion may insinuate themselves as imperceptibly as prejudices  for  it and they are at least as highly blameable If God has really given a revelation of his will to mankind every degree of unfairness in examining its evidence will be highly vicious in the judgment of reason and natural conscience and will evidently deserve the severest punishment But without pretending to judge of men's secret intentions we may surely say that when men attack religion either in public or private either in conversation or from the press by throwing out undistinguished reflexions against the clergy when they exaggerate the failings of individual clergymen and charge them on the whole body when they attempt to reproach the spirit of the ministerial office by partial or wrong representations of its nature when they labour to overturn religion by raising a groundless prejudice against the teachers of it this affords a presumption of prejudice though perhaps unsuspected by themselves which when it is pointed out to them may justly excite them to review the temper and care with which they have enquired  into religion If an infidel be not possessed with blameable prejudice he will certainly confine himself in his attacks against religion to direct arguments carefully avoiding every topic which may weaken its  influence  without deciding concerning its  truth  Let illiberal reflexions against the clergy be left to the tribe of  vulgar  infidels▪ who have not perhaps penetration enough to discover that they do not amount to a full consutation of christianity Let those abstain from them who are capable of perceiving that many ministers may be extremely vicious and yet the office which they hold may have a virtuous tendency and the gospel may be true  MY subject leads me also to address the  christian  people It leads me to warn you my friends not to allow any man to  beguile you with enticing words by slight and cunning craftiness whereby many lie in wait to deceive  Col ii Eph iv  It leads me to  exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are  many  crept  into christian countries who  deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ  Jude iii  Let not example let not inconclusive cavils let not unsubstantial turns of wit prevail with you to  deny the  Lord that bought  you  Pet ii  in opposition to your rational conviction You may adopt some of the maxims of infidels without perceiving their consequences you may be infected with their  spirit  while you reject their  principles  This is shameful inconsistence but every day's experience evinces that men may fall into it Infidels have no prejudice against ministers of the gospel except on account of their being the teachers of christianity they reproach  them  only that they may wound  religion  But do not some of you join in despising ridiculing or reproaching the christian  ministry  though you acknowledge the truth of the christian  religion  The conduct of infidels is extremely foolish because their reasoning is evidently fallacious But your conduct is infinitely more absurd you promote the designs of unbelievers against yourselves you inconsiderately contribute to the success of a cause which you abhor It has been often observed that modern deists have derived from those very scriptures which they reject juster opinions in natural religion than the wisest heathens were able to form by unassisted reason and that the gospel has thus insensibly refined the principles even of its enemies But it may be observed with equal truth that the prevalence of infidelity has  greatly corrupted the  sentiments  and  practice  even of those whose  faith  it could not directly subvert Be on your guard therefore against the contagion of its spiritIndeed you have a right to expect exemplary holiness from your ministers vice in them may justly excite your indignation and your expressing your disapprobation of it in every proper manner may prevent it from becoming frequent Be sure however to find fault only with real vices Confine your censures to the individuals who are guilty In your censures even of them remember still that they are weak and fallible creatures like yourselves exposed to all the temptations of this state of trial But let not the faults of a few be imputed to all Do not on account of them despise or reproach the office Blame vicious ministers for behaving  unsuitably  to their profession but remember that this very judgment implies the  excellence  of that profession While you believe the gospel you ought to preserve a high regard for the office of teaching it you ought to  esteem  those who are employed in it  very highly in love for their work's sake  Thess v  If you despise the  order  in general you despise their  work  you despise the  gospel  for the gospel is both the source and the subject of their employment Is this consistent with your being christians  YOU brethren as well as ministers enjoy great advantages for the practice of holiness by the gospel Your obligations and your dangers are very similar to ours It is your business to study and to practise that religion which it is our business to teach and inculcate on you Let your sense of the advantages which it affords animate you to blameless holiness Let your sense of the danger of your misimproving these advantages excite your vigilance and caution In opposition to all temptations  walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called  Eph iv    walk worthy of the Lord unto all wellpleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God  Col i    let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ  Philip i  which you have learned which we have taught and by which both you and we must be judged at last  MAY God fill the hearts both of ministers and of the people with the true spirit of the gospel of JESUS  Amen  THE END
