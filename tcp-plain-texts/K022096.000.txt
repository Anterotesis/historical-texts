 YOUTH  Price  s  YOUTH  A POEM  BY HALL HARTSON ESQ  From violet beds▪ and wreathed bowers  Advance the Graces and the smiling Hours  With yonder So  of Hope to sport and play  And crown the revels of his flowery May  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN in CatharineStreet Strand  MDCCLXXIII  YOUTH  SWEET youth sweet smiling nymph divinely fair  Source of all joy and foe to every care  With whom full many a summer's sunny morn  While yet the dew drop glittered on the thorn  I've sought the cliff or in the flowery vale  Imbibed the fragrance of the evening gale  Fair fugitive whose eye of heavenly blue  And rosy cheek no longer bless my view  Whose loved idea which can never fly  Wakes the fond wish and heaves the fruitless sigh  Thy sweet remembrance now the song inspire  And touch the lover with a poet's fire  What brighter genius what distinguished name  Shall lend its lustre to the pleasing theme  Lives there a man that with superiour art  Sounds all the deep recesses of the heart  Calls up the genial hopes the chilling fears  Now shakes with laughter now dissolves to tears  Who Proteus like at pleasure shifts the scene  Or old or young impassioned or serene  Still faithful to his aim if such there be  Blest child of Nature Garrick thou art he  Come then a while forego the thronged applause  Which nevererring judgment justly draws  And with the light the gay descriptive muse  While pleased her airy travel she pursues  Recall the happy scene which once was ours  The smiles the graces and the jocund hours  With whom we frolicked in our early day  When pleasure filled her cup without allay  From every quarter of earth's peopled sphere  See at the Muse's call what crowds appear  Eager alike to run life's little span  The gay the reckless progeny of man  Ah happy race far happier than they know  Light as the summer breeze first bid to blow  Unceasing as the busy tribes on wing  That roam the blossoms and despoil the spring  Along the verge of that fair seeming hill  Where life ascends and Hebe sports at will  They move nor mark upon the neighbouring heights  What envious eyes o'erlook their young delights  Suspicion Rumour with uncertain stare  And farther up the fiend sharp visaged Care  Blest ignorance to partial views confined  Where sight wou'd injure who wou'd not be blind  Young is the sense enjoyment in it's spring  Hope yet unbroken fancy on the wing  The jest the easy laugh the wanton wile  And antick trick which mocks with harmless guile  These are the sweets their youthful morn bestows  The bloomy flush of health and sound repose  Thrice happy whom no greater cares employ  Than for to morrow's sure returning joy  Yet have they ills for man to ills is heir  And youth as well as age has got it's share  The interdicted wish the harsh command  The terrours of Correction's rigid hand  Mishaps the chance of light unthinking years  Pale surfeit that oft wakes a mother's fears  Discord beside inflames with little rage  For Discord has her part on every stage  But here she walks not in her tragick form  As easy raised as easy laid the storm  Oh how unlike the wasteful ire that rends  The labouring breast when riper age contends  Turn ye ambitious at whose unblest call  War wakes his terrours and whole nations fall  Ye whom the curse of civil rage impels  When parricide not war the tumult swells  As o'er Britannia's much afflicted land  The fiend hath often waved her horrid brand  Turn turn nor in this youthful school despise  To catch the virtues of the simply wise  Here no ambition mocks it's fruitless toils  No hero weeps repentant o'er his spoils  Nor frowning shade of warriour lost in fight  Breaks the soft slumbers of the peaceful night  Light as the clouds that drop the vernal showers  To ope the buds and cheer the rising flowers  Their quarrels pass and smiling peace returns  And a new friendship in each bosom burns  Too much of discord glad the wandering muse  The peaceful and more pleasing toil renews  To mark yon tribe where o'er the mossy ground  They fly pursue and leap or run or bound  As buoyant spirits prompt them all intent  As swallows whom chill winter long hath pent  Now issuing forth upon the warmer beam  Wave the smooth pool or skim the murmuring stream  Now here now there their airy sports they ply  And many a playful circle cleaves the sky  Still as the eye wide wanders o'er the green  New aims new objects crowd the changeful scene  Here rise the mimick works of war like hands  There in mock fight engage the marshaled bands  Here too the painted galley meets the view  Along the shores exult the admiring crew  While o'er the lake it spreads it's silken sails  And all it's streamers feel the rising gales  Nor frown ye wise if wisdom deign to hear  Because such artless trifles meet the ear  The rose so loved must bud before it bloom  And yonder oak that spreads so wide a gloom  Beneath whose arms the flocks and herds repose  His fullgrown honours to an acorn owes  In this fair field are sown the seeds of fame  In each young bosom lives it's native flame  Which through these trifles breaks with early ray  These but the dawnings of their brighter day  In peaceful councils this shall gain renown  For that Bellona wreaths the war like crown  He too who gave his galley to the breeze  One day may hold the empire of the seas  And now even now elate with fancied power  Enjoys the glories of the future hour  Thus roll the months and years a golden round  With peace their nights their days with pleasure crowned  Nature mean time industrious to fulfil  The dictates of her mighty Master's will  The wellbeloved task incessant plies  And sees the work in fair proportion rise  Acts with new vigour on the conscious soul  Each part enlarges and informs the whole  As when the stream first issues from it's source  A gentle brook it murmurs without force  Plays through the pebbles and with silver maze▪  By many a flower and bending willow strays  Till with fresh tributary stores supplied  It pours into the main a copious tide  Thus swells the stream of life while evermore▪  Impatient youth regards the wider shore  Where man's adventurous bark with sails unfurled  First tries the deep and launches on the world  Passed is the dawn the boyish hours are fled  And lo the stripling rears his radiant head  With front erect and brightly beaming eye  Fresh as the star which gilds the evening sky  As the young plant the favourite of some fair  Her early solace and her later care  Uprising soft with living verdure crowned  Puts forth it's blooms and spreads it's fragrance round  Flushed with the gift of health sweet rosy hue  Thus breaks the riper stripling on the view  In all the pride of youth he stands displayed  Nor dreams that beauty blossoms but to fade  Blest season brightest in life's varied year  Too soon alas thy verdures disappear  Too soon thy roses wither in the wind  And leave the sharp unsightly thorn behind  Mean time from violet beds and wreathed bowers  Advance the graces and the smiling hours  With yonder son of hope to sport and play  And crown the revels of his flowery May  No more of artless words which on the tongue  With untaught lisp e'er while imperfect hung  Proud of his opening reason nor less vain  Of stature that o'ertops the younger train  He glances on them with averted eye  Admires himself and walks superiour by  Now glows the bosom with more potent fires  Teems with new projects throbs with new desires  Robuster sports the stripling youth employ  And all his soul is up for manly joy  Now to the wellreplenished fields he hies  Sometimes the plain sometimes the woodland tries  Where haunts the partridge or the timorous hare  And where the lapwing beats the sounding air  O'er hill o'er dale by lake or river toils  And late returns exulting in his spoils  The cheerful glass the lengthened tale succeeds  And all the game again in fancy bleeds  Sweet are the slumbers that from toils arise  More sweet the bliss which innocence supplies  Light from his couch and well refreshed he springs  What time the lark the lively summons sings  New joys invite him forth the dewy morn  The hound wide opening to the hightoned horn  The stag unharboured and the madding throng  With furious emulation borne along  O'er the swift steed Actaeon like he bends  And with the masters of the chase contends  Thus speeds the morn now sits the sun on high  And a fierce lustre breaks thro' all the sky  Parched are the flowers and blossoms all around  The panting flocks lie scattered o'er the ground  And from the reach of Phoebus' sultry fires  Imbowered the visionary muse retires  Not thus the glowing youth he on the shore  Where breezy waters spread their grateful store  Forthwith disrobes and in the midway flood  Allays the tumult of his boiling blood  Too daring thou thus fond the deep to brave  Be taught the dangers of the insidious wave  It chills relaxes deadly cramps assail  Ah what shall then thy boasted art avail  When with exhausted limbs thou strivest in vain  To reach the shores thou never shalt regain  Such was Ambrosio's such Endymion's doom  Oh early lost in youth's ethereal bloom  Twin brothers they the only lov'd remains  Of many sons that payed a mother's pains  I'llfated dame to early sorrows bred  The wretched mourner of a widowed bed  Whose lord the chance of battle snatched away  E'er yet the double offspring saw the day  But now the blooming pair her hopes renew  In these she seems again her lord to view  Their filial piety their rising years  Sooth all her losses and assuage her tears  'Twas on a day the feverish heat to cool  They sought the windings of the well known pool  Along whose margin flowers were thickly spread  And many a poplar reared it's graceful head  Like two fair swans elate in youthful pride  They breast the waves and roll the deep aside  They sport they toss now vanish now appear  Fate overlooks them with malignant leer  Ambrosio now the safer shore had gained  Endymion still within the flood remained  Full oft the former chid his long delay  In vain Death challenges the destined prey  Chill torture now had seized on all his frame  Ambrosio saw he heard the fearful scream  What doubts what thrilling woes the youth surprize  What boding horrours in his bosom rise  Swift to relieve into the deep he drove  Oh sad requital of fraternal love  Exhausted faint Endymion round him clings  And marrs the generous aid his friendship brings  Vain are all efforts in the embrace he holds  Fate ratifies the indissoluble folds  Nor can or youth find grace or beauty save  The tender victims from a watry grave  At once they sink and once again they rise  The deep at length ingulfs the precious prize  Hail hapless pair ye names for ever dear  Whose sad remembrance draws the painful tear  Loved youths companions of my brighter days  These mournful rites the song of friendship pays  So may the song survive when I decay  Nor die like you the blossom of a day  But see the sun declines a fresher breeze  Breathes on the flowers and rustles thro' the trees  Far in the vale where calm retirement dwells  Mid solitary rocks and mossgrown cells  O'erhung with shade that breaks the evening beam  Now plies the youthful angler on the stream  Marks the crisped waters with attentive eye  And cautious flings the well dissembled fly  Meantime his toils are soothed with various sounds  The mingled musick of the rural grounds  The thrush's mellow note the lark's more shrill  The woodman's echo from the neighbouring hill  While oft the cuckow from the steepy wood  Cheers the soft murmurs of the nether flood  Thrice happy youth to whom is given such joy  Thrice happy whom such guiltless sports employ  Such were the dear delights that once were mine  And such the scenes loved Erne which still are thine  Fairest of floods with whom my youthful day  Smooth like thyself stole unperceived away  Blest days when near thy ample wave I ranged  To all the busy cares of life estranged  When up the breezy hill each morn I flew  And airy youth gave rapture to the view  The sunny mead the loveinviting bower  The rushclad hamlet and the ruined tower  Thy numerous isles with waving verdure crowned  And azure hills the landscape's distant bound  But turn we now where other prospects rise  Proud structured domes that shade the lessening skies  The city's splendour and the motley throng  By business or by pleasure urged along  The scene we vary not the purposed aim  For nature in all places is the same  The rustick and the citizen we see  In manners differ but in soul agree  They love they hate to wrath alike give way  And hopes and fears by turns their bosoms sway  Alike the passions live in every mind  And spread their empire over human kind  But here within the city's ample round  Where opulence and men and arts abound  All shoots more forward nature earlier blooms  And sooner youth the port of man assumes  Superiour in each polished art appears  And thinks and talks and acts beyond his years  Here then amid this fruitful scene of things  The pride of riches and the pomp of kings  Let's mark his motions as the soul expands  And on the verge of manhood nature stands  Till now unnoted or but dimly seen  While the first spring revealed it's fainter green  Come forth the passions nor come forth in vain  An ever wakeful and imperious train  Swift agents full of Heaven's ethereal fires  Whose magick touch to instant act inspires  A giant host they approach with fearless van  Mount up and take the little fort of man  Pride envy hatred wrath with fiery glare  And fell revenge that knows not how to spare  A numerous throng which follow without names  Toss their fierce brands and spread the works in flames  Thus when the darts of sultry Sirius fly  And sudden horrours oft involve the sky  From the dark riven cloud the thunder rolls  And frequent flashes wrap the blazing poles  At once the loosened winds impetuous sweep  Roar through the forest and upheave the deep  Weak to resist the reeling bark gives way  Rolls with the billows and admits their sway  Such the mixed tumult now that inly swells  And such the force of passions which impels  But this outrageous phalanx to control  Their heat to temper and to sooth the soul  In sweeter notes Love sounds his soft alarms  And Beauty stands revealed in all her charms  Awed by her look their terrours they resign  Compose their rage and own the form divine  What hopes what fears what mixed emotions rise  What pleasing anguish now the bosom tries  Blest raptures never to be twice enjoyed  When all is novel and the sense uncloyed  E'er blooming youth unconscious of alloy  Has proved the fallacy of human joy  With love and earlier oft than love desire  Wakes in the soul a loose ungoverned fire  That quick thro' all the vital frame obtains  Flames in the heart and revels in the veins  Dethrones fair wisdom and assaults the shrine  Where dwell the virtues and the graces shine  Soft is the voice persuasive are the smiles  With which the mercenary fair beguiles  How bright the dome that wooes the passing eye  How sweet the odours which around it fly  Airs too Eolian airs salute the ear  And happiness and heaven itself seems near  Turn generous youth nor let the lovetuned lay  Of Thais lure thy heedless steps astray  Fly fly the sorceress fly her tainted charms  Remorse disease and death are in her arms  But other powers should wily Thais fail  More fatal oft the youthful sense assail  Gay blooming fresh with never fading green  Here Bacchus opes the jocund nightly scene  Through the glad circle breaths his social fires  Cheers with false hopes and fills with vain desires  Quick flies the jest with laughter loud repayed  And many a chorus echoes through the shade  Till flushed and pregnant with the purple god  As when of old the potent mystick rod  Waved high in air with frenzy fired the throng  And the loud I'o swelled the barbarous song  At once they rouse at once their shouts ascend  And war and tumult o'er the town impend  Unhappy wanderer doomed to certain woes  Whose steps these sons of Belial now oppose  Thrice hapless he the youth whose fairer fame  Such wild excesses soil with early shame  In some lewd quarrel haply not his own  This fatal night his force is overthrown  Struck with base fears his false associates fly  And leave him in the inglorious cause to die  Ah what avail him now the joys of wine  His social merits and his form divine  Sealed are those lips for ever mute that tongue  On which this morn such sweet persuasion hung  The smiles the graces every charm is fled  And mortal paleness settles in their stead  In vain for him the fond expectant sire  Counts the slow clock and cheers the slumbering fire  In vain the anxious matron mounts on high  Looke forth and often heaves the boding sigh  Far from her aid a bleeding corse he lies  And never more shall bless a parent's eyes  Thus here while various ills from Bacchus flow  Mark well the close approach of yonder foe  Dark son of stratagem who lives by spoils  Works in the shade and nightly spreads his toils  Detested monster whom no tears can bend  At war with all to all a seeming friend  Who quotes the maxims of the truly wise  And feigns to damn the very art he plies  Who hugs him in the spoil his frauds have won  And turns to laughter those he has undone  See how to yonder Youth he winds his way  Calls up his wiles and meditates the prey  Short is the strife with such unequal foes  At every game a wealthy manor goes  Flocks herds and fields are lost beyond recall  And one finesse deprives the youth of all  What shall he do An hopeless wretch he stands  No longer now the lord of many lands  Unhoused unpitied forced to beg for bread  Perhaps from those his former fortunes fed  Or in the caverns of a jail to lie  There mourn his folly and by famine die  These are the changes nature now unfolds  And thus her favourite son his progress holds  Here range the virtues there the vices stand  He weighs their worth but with unequal hand  Warped in his choice the balance he suspends  And spite of odds the vicious scale descends  Now Vanity her playful part assumes  And tricks him out in all her gayest plumes  South East and West are sought with curious care  And Boreas wafts the fluttering youth a share  For him the inventive artist hourly plies  Views every flower and blends the varied dyes  He raves of fashions gives the important rule  Which guides the mode of every mimick fool  Smiles simpers tosses his fantastick head  And strikes in thought each hapless fair one dead  Turn to the insect youth that art so vain  Then if thou can'st thy folly still maintain  Dressed by the summer sun from earth he springs  Opes his gay downs and spreads his golddrop'd wings  Turns every beauty to the sunny ray  And winnows with soft wing his easy way  Till from the North a sudden blast arise  Down drops the painted flutterer and dies  Even such the frail condition such the span  Which circumscribes the little race of man  Offspring of earth that blooms but to decay  The gaudy glittering insect of a day  Behold him now adrift without a guide  Borne down where pleasure rolls her rapid tide  Erroneous flood that wide it's wave expands  And in it's progress views a thousand lands  A thousand springs their copious urns supply  Swell the rich stream and pour temptation by  What stir what bustle what a mighty throng  Press to the shores or urge the deep along  Nor youth alone all ages all degrees  Female and male the eye of fancy sees  For who from Pleasure yet e'er turned the eye  Despised the Fair and passed her beauties by  Deluding sorceress stored with every art  To warp the judgment and ensnare the heart  By thee seduced the warriour doffs his arms  And sells his laurels for thy softer charms  The merchant too caught by thy wily train  Foregoes the rich the golden hour of gain  Thee the fond youth his brighter genius styles  Hangs on thy looks and lives but in thy smiles  Blest youth indeed if in her smiles sincere  His mistress were as constant as she's fair  Ah much misjudging to the future blind  Who thinks that pleasure always will be kind  Then when she sooths when most her charms delight  Even then she meditates dishonest flight  Bids her false breast with wellfeigned raptures heave  And plays the fond one only to deceive  FINIS
