 ORIGINAL LETTERS FAMILIAR MORAL and CRITICAL  By Mr  DENNIS  VOLUME the SECOND  LONDON  Printed for W MEARS at the  Lamb  without  TempleBar  M DCCXXI  ADVERTISEMENT to the READER concerning the following LETTER  THE following Letter was writ by me about sixteen Years ago But that the Reader may enter into it with the greater Ease and be the better entertain'd with it it will be convenient to lay before him the Occasion upon which it was writ It was towards the end of the last Century that Mr  Collier  publish'd a Book call'd  A short View of the Prophaness and Immorality of the  English  Stage  in which Book tho' there were several Things true in particular yet the Author was manifestly so unfair an Adversary in general that the latter End of the Book very grossly contradicted the beginning of it and endeavour'd to decry even a Regulated Stage which the Author at the beginning of the Book had acknowled'd useful About four or five Years after that as near as I can remember Mr  Collier  took occasion from the great Storm which happen'd about that Time to renew his Attack  upon the Stage in a little Pamphlet call'd  A Dissuasive from the PlayHouse written by way of Letter to a Person of Quality  Which Pamphlet upon the Fast Day that was order'd to be kept by publick Authority immediately after that Tempest was given to People  gratis  as they came out of the Churches The Design of it was to make the great Storm a Judgment upon the Nation for the Enormities of our Theatres The Hypocrisie was here so flagrant and so absurd and extravagant that it rais'd either the Indignation or Mirth of all discerning Men of Integrity At the same time it had a wonderful Influence upon the Weak and the Hypocrites and there was a great Outcry against the Stage so great a one that there was a warm Report about the Town that it had been twice debated in Council whether the Theatres should be shut up or continued Then it was that I could bear no longer but as I had before defended a regulated Stage against the Author's Attack in his  Short View  I was resolved to expose the Hypocrisie the Extravagance and the Sophistry of his  Dissuasive  This Resolution produced the following Letter which I call'd the  Person of Quality's Answer to Mr  Collier  's Letter  and which was intended to consist of a Mixture of Reason and Raillery and which was most agreeably receiv'd by some of the best Judges who were  then in  England  and particularly by the late Duke of  Buckingham  the late Earl of  Halifax  and the present Lord  Lansdown  As this Letter has been so long out of Print that it is as scarce as any Manuscript of which there is but one Copy I thought it might be as new and as entertaining to most of its Readers as if it had been never publish'd There remains one thing more with which I must acquaint the Reader and that is that I who have all my Lifetime abhorr'd Hypocrisie and scorn'd to pass for any thing which I am not tho' in the Title Page I call the Letter  the Person of Quality's Answer  have yet taken care in the Body of the Letter to acquaint the Reader that I am only a private Gentleman But I make no doubt but that I am a much more considerable Person than he to whom Mr  Collier  's Letter was writ who perhaps was no Body  THE Person of Quality's ANSWER TO Mr COLLIER'S LETTER  Containing a Defence of a Regulated Stage  LincolnsInnFields  Jan the st  Dear Doctor  THIS Afternoon I receiv'd your Edifying Evangelical  Dissuasive  for which What Thanks can I return you What Recompence can be sufficient May he for whose sake you did it amply reward you  I had conceived indeed a Zealous concern at the Disorders of the PlayHouse I lamented its having so much the ascendant of the Town and the Countenance of Figure and Fortune And I too justly presaged that these Nurseries of Licerse and Atheism especially  that in our Neighbourhood wou'd if unrestrain'd prove fatal to the Nation make us ripe for Destruction and pull down some terrible Vengeance on our Heads  no less than Popery or Arbitrary Power at the least and dear Doctor what a Day and what a Sight wou'd that be to you and me  For this Reason I resolved that in my Family Reformation and the Year should begin together and for that Reason I called them together as soon as they had dined today determining to read a long and a solemn Lecture out of your  Short View  to them but a strange Fatality had happen'd for some audacious Rats had so prophanely gnawn it that it was no longer legible a Detachment in my Conscience of PlayHouse Vermin whom the Devil had enter'd into for that purpose at his Congregation in the Neighbourhood  Thus bilk'd of my Homily I thought I must to my great Grief have been forced to dismiss my Flock For I perceived they were grown  frightfully Nice and Impatient and were resolved to be cur'd extempore or not at all  But then it was that in an auspicious Moment arriv'd your short but Divine  Dissuasive  I read it over as it were in a Breath while they all the while stood ga  ing to entertain it But the last incomparable  Paragraph but one I pronounced with a more emphatical Voice laid before them with all the Energy of my Lungs  the sad Instance of God's Judgment in the terrible Tempest when we were almost swept into Chaos  when Nature  seem'd to be in her last Agony and the World seem'd ready to expire  And what occasion said I to my gaping Audience to have Recourse to Tragedies when those Rants that Fustian and that Bombast with which deluded Mortals are nowadays so tickled are engagingly inserted into our very  Dissuasives  And here Doctor I made two Remarks to them upon the Judgment of the late dreadful Tempest For first said I the Outcries of the PlayHouse Practices are so aggravating so horrible that the Divine Vengeance which they brought down upon us has invol'd the very Innocent Not only the poor Inhabitants of  Cologn  but the very  Hamburgers  and  Dantzickers  and all the People of the  Baltick  have suffer'd for the Enormities of our  English  Theatres tho' I believe in my Conscience they never so much as heard of a Play and know no more the Difference between a Tragedy and Comedy than they do the Distance between the Earth and  Saturn  so that said I you may observe from hence 'tis not enough to keep away from these lewd Entertainments but you must endeavour with  all your Might to suppress the Conventicles of Satan  The second Observation that I made was this that we have reason to be thankful to Heaven for forbearing us so long For if the late dreadful Judgment had happen'd in the Reign of King  Charles  the Second when the PlayHouses were licentious in all their Impunity when Reformation was so far from being thought of that the very Name was despised and laught at what must the dismal Consequence not have been Then we should certainly have been swallow'd up since the  Judgment  was so terrible even the other Day after a five Years Reformation  What reason have we to be thankful that we live in an Age in which Light is come into the World For in what  Aegyptian  Darkness have we liv'd hitherto And what a poor Reformation was that which was carried on in Queen  Elizabeth  's time in Comparison of that which you are gloriously projecting For with that former Reformation the PlayHouse began grew up and spread and flourish'd What a shadow of a Reformation was that 'Tis true Popery was driven out and wholsome Laws were enacted to secure the Rights of the People But what signified all that when the PlayHouse was encourag'd For tho' as you learnedly observe  PlayHouses in the Reign of that great Queen were not permitted to be erected in the Liberties of the City yet in the Suburbs they were not only permitted but encourag'd with a Vengeance and by whom encourag'd Why not only by the People but by the Court nay by the Council yes by those poor deluded Wretches  Cecil  and  Walsingham  who believ'd it to be the Business forsooth of wise StatesMen to provide honest and reasonable Diversions for the People and at the same time were so infatuated so intoxicated as to believe the Entertainments of the Theatre not only to be honest and reasonable but the only honest and reasonable Diversions  Nay the poor mistaken Queen her self encouraged PlayHouses to that degree that she not only commanded  Shakespear  to write the Comedy of the  Merry Wives  and to write it in ten Days time so eager was she for the wicked Diversion but ev'n with that Hand that wielded the Scepter descended poorly to translate a Play that was writ by a  Grecian  Poet She had read it seems of some great Men among the  Romans  who had shewn the way as  Julius Caesar  had writ  Adrastus Augustus Ajax Gracchus Thiestes  and  Mecaenas Octavia  and she wanted Judgment alas poor Woman to distinguish between the Obligations of a Heathen and a Christian 'Tis  true she was wise enough in some things she kept out Popery and Arbitrary Power she defended us from  Rome  and  Spain  by the meer Force of her Prudence But what signified that you know Doctor when she encourag'd the PlayHouses and wanted Foresight in that particular to presage that these Nurseries of Vice and Atheism wou'd prove fatal to the Nation  It seems some Fools about her had told her that at a time when Taxes were frequent and grievous some honest Diversions would comfort the People but that it would be unreasonable to deprive them at once of their Money and of their Pleasure too this she had been told and she like an easie Woman believ'd it But what amazes me most is this Doctor that not only that Queen and her Council encouraged Plays but not so much as one of the famous Prelates in her time said so much as a word against them 'Tis true the StatesMen defended us against  Spain  very vigorously and very effectually and so did the ChurchMen against the  Roman  See but alas their poor and narrow Spirits contented themselves with that But not so much as one word was said against the Abominations of the PlayHouses There were Reformers indeed Were they so senseless that they wanted Discernment to see the  flaming and Outragious Wickedness  of them  Or so very wicked that they wanted Zeal to discharge their Duty in suppressing them Ah my dear Doctor had you but liv'd in those Times you wou'd have taught that Queen her Lesson in loyal Libels have told her her Duty affronted her Authority defam'd her Servants and boldly have told her that she countenanc'd them only to debauch her People You would have open'd the Eyes of those Fools who believ'd  Shakespear  to be Instructive as well as Innocent You would have extracted more  Smutt  from his Comedies than a Chimney does from Seacoal And what Prophaness and Blasphemy had you not found in his Tragedies You would have satisfy'd both Queen and Council and Clergy too that their Business was to suppress the PlayHouses and to let  Spain  and  Rome  alone That the Danger that they were in was not from  Philip  the Second and  Sixtus  the Fifth but from Tyrants who had been many a Year defunct from  Julius Caesar  and  Macbeth  you would have  presaged  the Storm that the latter would have pull'd down upon the Nation a hundred Years after 'twas writ You had then been  Histrio Mastix  the first whereas you are now but the second of that glorious Name and then had old bungling  Pryn  been cropt for presuming to copy you Thus my dear Doctor we have reason to believe what  you would have done from what we behold you do For tho' Popery and Slavery are at our Doors and each Moment are rushing in upon us and nothing but the Wisdom of one Woman stands between us and them yet you still retain your commendable Passive Principle appear as unconcern'd as if you had sworn to be a Foe to neither are found to be as little alarm'd for theChurch as if you had thrown off itsCause as you have cast off its Habit and instead of crying out Slavery Popery do nothing but cry out the PlayHouse the PlayHouse with as much Fury as if you were afraid it should contribute to the keeping them out  But my dear Doctor by the leave of your Modesty I must exalt your Glory to a higher Pitch When Queen  Elizabeth  died King  James  succeeded her and among the eminent Reformers of his Reign there was no talk of the Stage Nay on the contrary to their Shame be it spoken that King and his Court appear'd to be infinitely delighted with Plays And in his Visits to the two Universities Plays were the chief of his Entertainment But what would we have Doctor as the Education is so is the Youth And he had been tutor'd by old  George  a notorious Reformer but a notorious Playwright For the Sot believ'd it seems that the  Drama  could contribute to the Reformation of Mankind  To King  James  succeeded King  Charles  the First and then arose another famous Reformer  John Milton  by Name who not only left a Tragedy behind him the Story of which he impiously borrow'd from the Bible written to leave him without Excuse in his mature nay declining Years but has left a fine Encomium on  Shakespear  has shewn an extraordinary Esteem for  Johnson  and among all the Things that he thought fit to reform so far had Prejudice laid hold of his Understanding it never so much as came into his Head that the Stage was one of them  But then about that time Doctor there arose a Reformer indeed Brother  Pryn  of Illustrious Memory a Person indeed of an  amazing  Boldness For to the Fervency of his furious Spirit Ruine and Reformation were all one With these Zealot's Thoughts he set about reforming the Church as well as the Stage and by preparing the Downfal of one made way for the Ruine of the other 'Tis true he lost some part of himself in the Cause But happy the Ears that were so lost How much happier than those that stand pricking up daily at the Ribaldry of our Modern Comedies I know dear Doctor under the Rose that you have the same Design and that you will never leave off writing as long as there is left either a Prelate or Poet in  England  or if you do condescend to admit of Bishops you will at least suffer no such Bishops as have a Tang of the Stage I mean no swearing prophane Bishops but such whose meek and Christian Communication is only Yea and Nay  As you have the same noble Design may you find better Fortune as you well deserve For he my dear Doctor was but a Type of your more excellent self tho'indeed an illustrious Type And he but anticipated in a cold and a gloomy way the very things that Fate had designed to be said with Fire and Flame by you He indeed overthrew but for a time the Church and Stage together But may you with a more propitious Fate But holdNo Man you know is able to tell into whose Hands a Letter may fall  Thus Doctor the blessed Work of Reformation went on and down went the Bishops and the Stage together but after they had lain for some time in the Dust were restor'd together and with them the banish'd King  And there are not People wanting who believe that the restoring the Stage was one of the Motives to the restoring the banish'd King for say they the People of  England  were at last grown weary of a nasty gloomy sullen Fanatical Government and began to long for their Pleasures How  my dear Doctor The restoring the Stage was one of the Motives to restoring the banish'd King Ah my dear Doctor if you had but flourish'd in that auspicious Juncture How happy would you have esteem'd your self to have been the Instrument of suppressing the Stage only on purpose to see it restor'd with such a glorious Attendant  Well the King the Bishops and the Stage were restored together and a long time flourish'd together without any talk of reforming the PlayHouses much less of suppressing them For the merry Ministers of that happy Prince laugh'd at a Reformation And even the foremost Ministers of the Church at that time among whom were certainly some of the greatest Men that the Christian World has produc'd appear'd by no means to be so terribly alarm'd at the Entertainments of the Stage  You your self I remember Doctor were then at Years of Discretion and yet with passive Ears and Tongue endur'd the Filth of  Epsom  Wells the Bawdy of the  Soldier's Fortune  and the Beastliness of  LimberHam  But the time of your Prophetick Mission it seems was not yet come or perhaps you thought it improper to fall out with the PlayHouses before you had fallen out with the Government But you have at last to the wonder of the World declar'd your  self and we may say of you what  Lucretius  said of his ador'd  Epicurus  Pardon the Comparison I beseech you Doctor  That you in Wit surpass Mankind as far  As does the Midday Sun the Midnight Star  For what in the beginning of the Reformation was never seen neither by  Jewell  nor  Ridley  nor  Cranmer  nor  Latimer  nor was afterwards hardly so much as thought of by the judicious the penetrating the sagacious  Hooker  nor what in this latter end of it as under the Rose we sweetly hope Doctor has not been found out neither by  Wilkins  nor  Tillotson  who have shown so much Understanding and so much Judgment as well by the Force of their invincible Arguments as of their clear chaste noble and masculine Styles What none of these have been able to find you have plainly convinc'd the World of that the PlayHouse would bring all to Ruin O Miracle of boundless Sagacity O Prodigy of Penetration The late Archbishop was certainly a Man of as undoubted Probity of as much Integrity as ever liv'd in the World nor was his Zeal and his Boldness in the Cause of Virtue less witness that noble that intrepid Spirit with which he appear'd against Popery even in the most dangerous times when the Jesuits us'd  sharp decisive Arguments and made nothing of cutting a Man's Throat out of Zeal to confute his Doctrine the late Archbishop I say Doctor who had so much Boldness as well as Zeal and Integrity and who in the late Reign had so much Power never saw this dreadful Danger from Plays which you have so plainly discover'd  There is something in the Eleventh Volume of his Sermons again  Plays  which I had not seen when this was writ but Mr  Collier  has prevaricated vilely in the Quotation  For if he had seen it he would have prevail'd upon the late Queen to suppress them He either foresaw none of this Danger or if he did the good mistaken Man thought there would be more in going about to prevent it An infallible Sign that he wanted your Foresight and your Sagacity He look'd upon himself to be indispensably bound in a double Respect to reform the Corruptions of the times For he was both Head of the Church and first Counsellor of State And no Man knew better than that judicious Prelate that Corruptions of Manners are most pernicious both to Church and State And no Man ever discover'd more Zeal for the present Establishment both in Church and State And yet poor Man with all his Understanding and all his Zeal he was  o far deluded in this Particular that he never  medled with these Nurseries of License and Atheism As many admirable Sermons as he left behind him against the Vices and the Errors of the Times I believe you will hardly find that he has mentioned the PlayHouses with Bitterness in them all He left that part of Reformation for your sublimer Prudence and more Heroick Charity Indeed the Concern that he had himself both in Church and State was so apparent that perhaps he might fear that a violent Endeavour to reform our Theatres in him might look like Interest and might perhaps imagine that the Work would be kindlier received if it were carried on by one who cared not a Farthing either for Church or State  And here Doctor give me leave to admire the Glory or to speak in your own Diviner Language the  Meridian Blaze of your mysterious Charity 'Tis of an amazing Size and Brightness  and our weak Eyes are dazled at it For that you dear Doctor who appear so extremely nice and scrupulous that you dare not so much as take an Oath to defend our Sovereign Lady and us against our Mortal Enemies you who are so over cautious that you dare not so much as hold any Communion with us that you should take up this extream Concern for our Souls that you should be  violent for our Salvation is beyond Expression  wonderful When I consider that all who are engaged by Duty are either dumb or very cold in the matter while you are declaiming with so much Fervour with so much Zeal against the Disorders of our Theatres you who have nothing to do with the Matter I can never sufficiently admire the Excess of your Zeal which is too high and too heavenly to be comprehended by a Mortal  I can only say that 'tis a thousand pities 'tis confin'd to so narrow a Sphere But alas good Man it is none of your Fault that it is not more universal For we have reason to be sensible that if you were not restrain'd by the Apprehension of brutal and beastly Force you would not fail to declaim with the same Heat and the same Bitterness against both Church and State  This amazing Brightness of your Charity has drawn upon you the Envy of some good Men has made you become the Hatred of Libertines and the Jest and Scorn of Buffoons I Doctor am your Champion against them all and I have many a bickering in your Behalf even with my moderate Friends who are indeed for reforming the Licentiousness of the Stage but are by no means for a Suppression of the PlayHouses Mr  Collier  says one of them is too severe He does not consider the Times that we live in These are not  the Primitive Apostolical Times but the last and corrupt Ages of the World The Capital of a great Kingdom must have Meetings for publick Pleasure If Mr  Collier  is for pulling down Plays let him name a more harmless and reasonable Diversion to be establish'd in the room of them What would he have us always at our Devotion Or does he expect that we should be all devout Would he have Devotion a Mode and Fashion as it is in  France  where the Rake is as devout as the Archbishop the Whoremaster as the Monk and the most inconsiderable Punk at  Versailles  as the most glorious Madam  de Maintenon  'Tis true said he there are things in some of our Plays that I could heartily wish were out but Mr  Collier  is too rigid too harsh and out of all measure severe He does not bear with the least Faults and seems to have no Indulgence for Human Frailty Thus Doctor you were attack'd the other Day by a Friend of mine and you shall see how I defended you  Lord Sir says I you are the most mistaken Man in the World Mr  Collier  is no such Person as you imagine He is a goodnatur'd sweet temper'd Man as lives and will bear as far as any Man whatever And as for your saying that he has no Indulgence for Human Frailty why 'tis a sign that you don't know him 'Tis true she has taken a fatal Aversion to the Play  House and he will down with it We have all of us an Aversion for something or other And why should you be so much concern'd for that  Rendezvous of Rakes and Strumpets  But yet Mr  Collier  has Indulgence enough for them too any where but in the PlayHouse And where's the mighty Hardship then upon them Are there no places for them to assemble at but there Are there not Taverns BrandyShops CoffeeHouses ChocolateHouses GamingHouses for the Rakes and  Indian  Houses MusickHouses BawdyHouses either for Strumpets solitary or Strumpets and Rakes in Conjunction according as they please Has Mr  Collier  writ one Word for five Years together against any of these Places For Godsake what do you call want of Indulgence then Is not every CoffeeHouse in Town grown a GamingHouse May not we go every Hour of the Day into several of them and see and hear twenty fellows swearing and blaspheming and one surrounded by that horrid Crew  Shaking with bloody Oaths the Box  And calling upon Plague and Pox  T' assist him  Why there they may swear and be damn'd for all Mr  Collier  He troubles himself with swearing no where but in the Play  House But what do you mean by Human Frailty When People are wicked in earnest that's something He has nothing to say against such But to be vicious in Jest to play the fool with the Devil to counterfeit Sin forsooth on pretence of decrying it why these are  dreadful Provocations this is flaming and outragious Wickedness  and Wickedness which he is positively and absolutely resolv'd that he will not endure  Come come says he I begin to be sensible of the Matter Mr  Collier  is now declining in Years and the Affairs of the World go not according to his Wishes And Age and Disappointments have sower'd his Blood and made him lose the relish of Sports and gay Diversions Once more said I you are the most mistaken Man in the World Mr  Collier  is far from being a Foe to the gayest Sports and Pastimes but then he is for having those who frequent them take the Consent and Approbation of the  Nonjuring  Clergy along with them who you know are  Persons of Sobriety and Conduct  He'll tell you that the Sports that good Bishop  Laud  appointed for the Sabbath were not only safe but commendable That for Example Cricket when it came to be so recommended immediately became Canonical Football Or  hodox and JuggleCat  Jure Divino  But  or the Layety to be so impertinent as to  chuse Diversions for themselves and particularly for the Ladies to believe that they have Capacities enough to judge between right and wrong and to distinguish Decency from what is not  Decorum  he takes to be an Enormity that is never to be allow'd of in any Christian Country  The PlayHouse said I is one of those Diversions which Mr  Collier  believes to be too luscious a Pastime for the Layety To see and to read Plays he thinks is enough for one of his establish'd Virtue And it must be own'd that he has read or seen more than any Person in  Christendom  As for the Layety less vigorous Diversions may serve them The Men may take a Game at Bowls in the Summer and a Game at Whisk in the Winter The Women in Winter may visit their grave Relations and in Summer Evenings may take a Boat to cool themselves  The same Company for the most that frequents the  Park  freque  the  PlayHouse  For as for the  Park  he says that is a place that  is too much frequented by Rakes and Strumpets He does not mean  he says  that all the Company there are so but this he may affirm  he says  that scarce any Quarter is sometimes so plentifully stock'd Now who  says Mr  Collier would trust his Health in a Place of Mortality or go to the Pesthouse for Recreation  Thus Mr  Collier  like a Person  of Conduct and Sobriety treats the Layety with the same Circumspection that a  Romish  Priest does his Congregation at high Mass who only delivers the Wafer to the People and reserves the Wine for himself  But Doctor I had almost forgot one Thing that I urg'd among the restin your Defence and that was the Reason why you stick so close to the PlayHouse and let some other flaming Vices alone which he was pleased to enumerate and that was that you took this way of proceeding to be laying the Ax to the Devilish Root of the accursed Branches that the PlayHouse was the undoubted Cause of all the Iniquity in the Nation and that if we could but down with that a sudden Reformation would follow among all sorts of People That Porters would no longer be drunk with Belch That vigorous Captains would be tilting no more at handsome Drawers in Taverns That losing Gamesters would no more Blaspheme And my Lady  Dabcheek  's Basset Bank would be immediately broke  These are the things that I have said in your behalf to several of the Enemies of your  Short View  and  Defence  I now come to tell you what has happen'd upon the receiving your  Dissuasive  tho' 'tis scarce three Hours since its Arrival Immediately upon the reading it my eldest Son  Jack  told me that he was perfectly satisfied that  Plays were abominable and taking his Hat his Sword and his Cloak went away for St  James  's My eldest Daughter  Susan  is gone to take a Walk in the Garden to meditate there in the dark that she may have the Arguments in Readiness by which she says she designs to convert her Sister But my younger Son  Charles  made some Objections and so did my Daughter  Harriet  which I here send you as well as I can recollect them because I know Doctor that you are able to answer them better than I can  Sir says  Charles  I have promis'd my Lady  Freelove  to Day to wait upon her to the Play and so has my Sister  Harriet  but for the future I promise you to keep away and so I dare say will my Sister if you will but answer some Objections that we have to make against Mr  Collier  's Discourses  I know no Reason why Mr  Collier  should pretend to meddle with our Diversions If he is really offended at Plays himself in the name of God let him keep away I know no body who is fond of his Company there But since we don't pretend to oblige him to come why should he presume to oblige us to keep away  If Mr  Collier  is really offended at PlayHouses I would fain know how long he he has been so or what is the Reason that he did not write against them when he was  young For the Stage was really then more licentious than it is now Since he forbore writing against them till he was old we humbly desire that we may not leave them till we are old And then perhaps we may have some natural or some politick Considerations that may oblige us to rail as much as he does  How comes this Man to take up so much Concern for us Is it Christian Charity and a tender Care for our Souls I would fain ask him one Question Is not true Religion that which is chiefly necessary for the Salvation of Souls If he says it is why then let me ask him another Question Is the Religion which we of the present establish'd Church of  England  profess the true one or is it not If it is why does not he hold Communion with us If it is not why does not he set us right Has he a Concern for our Souls or not If he has why does he not mind the main thing If he has not why does he pretend to make us uneasie and set us together by the Ears about Trifles  Is it a Concern for the State that makes him take up his Pen because perhaps he believes that the Corruptions of the Stage may prove of dangerous Consequence to the Government But if he has that extream Concern for it Why does he not take an Oath to be true to it Why does he not Abjure the Gentleman who dwells at St  Germains  He believes us Schismaticks and he believes us Rebels and takes no Notice of the Matter But if we talk of going to a Play the Man's Zeal grows flaming and outragious upon it Certainly his is a very nice and very extraordinary Charity  But if he is offended at Plays so much as he pretends why does he see them why does he read them so much Why should he be so ridiculously conceited and so spiritually proud as to think that he can stand under Temptations under which we must fall  If he has so much Aversion for Plays as he pretends if they are so very horrible why has he read so many why has he done Evil that Good may come of it If he really loves them and they are not so abominable Why has he writ against them If he has writ against Plays that he loves How comes it that he says nothing against the Church and State which he hates  What Reason can be given for that unless that he waits for his Opportunity which by setting us at Variance about Trifles he hopes in some Measure to hasten or unless while in the Face of the World he is bombarding the Stage he is diligently in private undermining the Church and the State  In this Age of universal Toleration when Nonsense of every Sort and Size is tolerated  not only that gloomy sullen lifeless Nonsense which is to be heard at  Quakers  and  Anabaptist  Meetings but that sparkling spirited fiery Fustian which is to be found in our  Dissuasives  in an Age in which Schism it self is tolerated Heresie is tolerated nay when Mr  Collier  's Jacobite Congregation is tolerated in this Age of universal Toleration for Hypocrisie and Nonsense shall we suffer an Inquisition to be set up for Wit and Sense and Pleasure  We are willing to have all the Indulgence in the World for the Errors and Frailties of our Fellow Creatures and tho' we may believe some of them Schismaticks believe some of them Hereticks yet we are not for reforming them against their Wills nor saving them out of Malice And we thought we might have hop'd at least that the Government might have hop'd that at the same time that it indulges some of them not only in different ways of Worship but ways which are disagreeable and some of them prejudicial to it and ways which neither are nor were nor ever will be tolerated in any other Kingdom of  Europe  we thought I say that the Government might have hop'd that these very Persons would have born with a Diversion which is establish'd by that and which is not only protected by each of the Governments of  the most considerable Kingdoms in  Europe  but which has had always the Allowance of publick Authority in the most flourishing Nations and has been believed by them all to be the fittest Entertainment that can be allow'd by publick Authority At a time when the Government has shewn so much Indulgence for them might it not be expected that they should shew some Regard for that and not demand with furious Clamours the Suppression of an Entertainment establish'd by its Authority For are not these Clamours against the Queen whose Servants the Players are Is it not her that they attack thro' them And may not we reasonably fear that as they begin this Reformation as they did that in Forty so if they are suffer'd to go on they will end it like that and bring all things into Confusion  Pray Sir consider have we spent so much Blood and Treasure in the Defence of our Liberties and shall we suffer an Inquisition to be set up for that which is the very Life and Soul of Liberty and that is harmless Pleasure for 'tis for harmless Pleasure we only contend Let the Corruptions of the Stage be banish'd but let the rest remain Yet at the same time it must be allowed that it is not Mr  Collier  who is a proper Judge of their Innocence or their Guilt One would judge my Lord Chamberlain  and the Master of the Revels have common Sense to distinguish right from wrong Is Mr  Collier  a Person fit to be appeal'd to from them And shall we not dare to go to a Play till his LicenseOffice is open Shall we suffer our selves to be led by the Nose by a Declamator till we are brought into such a Condition that we shall long for Slavery How long shall we suffer Hypocrisie to pass upon us for exact and scrupulous Virtue Tropes for Reason and Foppish Affectation for fine Language  Shall we not only suffer an Inquisition to be set up for Pleasure but as it were by universal implicit consent permit his Disciples to set up themselves for Inquisitors When the Government of  England  pretends to give no Laws to the People but by vertue of their own Election and their own Consent Shall the Rabble erect themselves into Legislators and presume to give Laws to the Queen her self and all the Nobility and Gentry of  England  whether they will or no  What has Mr  Collier  to do with our Diversions Let him prove the Authority of his Mission to Preach up the abolishing of that heathen Invention a PlayHouse Cannot we meet together in a PlayHouse where we have no manner of Design upon Mr  Collier  without alarming him and raising his Passions as he calls it to  Combustion  when at the same time we have suffer'd him so long to meet in his separate Congregations where we reasonably believe that he has a Design upon us Certainly his is a pleasant Charity who in the very Hour of Death can absolve an Impenitent Traytor and damn a poor Fellow with Absolute Power only for going to the PlayHouse What can he mean at this time of Day when our Religion and Laws and Liberties are in the utmost Danger from the Designs of  France  and  Rome  abroad and a base perfidious Party at home thus to divert Men from looking after their All by scaring them with ridiculous Presages from the Corruptions of the Stage If Corruptions contrary to the Queen's Knowledge have crept into our Theatres and Corruptions too enormous to be born by his scrupulous Virtue why did he not as his Loyalty oblig'd him to do humbly Petition her Majesty to redress them instead of making use of the Licentiousness of the Press to raise seditious Clamours against her Conduct to the People  It must be acknowledg'd there are Corruptions which are crept into our Theatres for into what Human Inventions will not Corruptions creep since it is plain that they insensiby creep into Religion which is of Divine Establishment but 'twould be a monstrous Conclusion that because of  the Corruptions of the Church of  Rome  reveal'd Religion ought to be suppressed and Men to turn Deists or Atheists  'Tis true there are Passages in several of our Plays which I could heartily wish were out But neither do I see a quarter so many as Mr  Collier  does nor do I look upon those which I do see thro' his magnifying Opticks The long View that he has taken of Smutt as he very quaintly calls it in his  short View of the Stage  puts me in mind of a  Dutch  Grotesque that is at my Lady  Freelove  's where there is an Antick Frier who has cast off his Frock squinting thro' a Microscope at a wanton Nun who has thrown off her Petticoat But Mr  Collier  is mistaken if he thinks that to discern some certain matters he has need of a magnifying Glass He has a Hawks nay an Eagles Eye of his own at them and I dare say can see as clearly and as distinctly through two Petticoats and a Smock as  Eustace Cummins  of Immortal Memory could swear through a two Inch Board  'Tis very true Sir as I observed before that there are several things in our Comedies which I could wish had been left out and there are particularly some Bawdy Passages in them which I wish the Authors had had more respect for the Audience in general and for the Fair Sex in  particular than to have inserted in them But does he think our Virtue so very weak either the Ladies or the Gentlemens that we cannot give them a transitory Hearing without being debauch'd by them while his it seems is so very strong that he can dwell for Months upon them and make a full Collection of them a Collection which has taught several of our Ladies more Bawdy in two Hours than they could have learn'd in so many Years at the PlayHouse Does he believe that no body ought to entertain them obscenely but himself Or does he pretend to erect a Monopoly for Bawdy to retail it to his Stationers as oft as his Occasions require 'Tis true there are Corruptions which have crept into our Theatres and these Corruptions ought to be reformed but therefore ought the Stage to be ruin'd Is not the Corruption of the Stage an evident Proof of its original Goodness since what is originally wicked never can be corrupted But in what Human Conversation is there not Corruption  Does Mr  Collier  really believe that there is no swearing in GamingHouses No Intriegues at  India  or ChocolateHouses No Lying and no Sharping in CoffeeHouses no beastly Lewdness at MusickHouses and BawdyHouses If he believes that these Places are guilty of the Crimes imputed to them Why does he not Preach to them  which have a great deal more Occasion for Reformation than the PlayHouse For in most of them you have Venom without Preservative but the PlayHouse carries or should carry the Antidote with the Poison If Mr  Collier  has seen any of these Places as 'tis hard to believe that one of his Experience should not have been at some of them methinks he should be convinc'd that by correcting of them he would begin with the Head whereas now he but pleases and tickles Corruption by catching Reformation by the Tail A little common Sense may serve to convince a Man that the reforming the Stage would never reform the Town but the reforming the Town would certainly reform the Stage  What is the Reason then that Mr  Collier  neglecting the Vices of the Town keeps such a Bustle at those of the Stage Why because it is not his Design or Business to correct or reform any thing His only Business is to set up himself To erect an obscure Schismatical Parson into a Saint of the first Magnitude To pass for a Man of more Sanctity than all the Bishops and of more Discernment than all the Ministers of State His Business is not to correct and reform but to amuse to puzzle to make a Noise and a Party to make the Stage the Apple of Dissention to set us  untimely Variance at this dangerous  Juncture He has Experience enough of the World to know that a Noise and a Party is not to be made by barely attacking of Vice For by doing that he would oblige only the Virtuous And alas they are but few and a silent a modest and an humble Party But by attacking the Stage he obliges the Vitious too and they are numerous and pert and arrogant and noisie and tumultuous 'Tis true the Virtuous are Enemies to the Vices and Corruptions of the Stage But only the Guilty and the Hypocrites are Enemies to a Stage reform'd because a Stage reform'd would be Enemies only to them When Mr  Collier  began to write his  short View  he designed to oblige only the first for in the beginning of that Book his Intent is plainly to reform the Stage But then afterwards he wisely consider'd that the obliging the Virtuous would not do his Business They are not enough to cry up their Champion and bring him into Reputation But if he appear'd an Enemy to the Stage it self and attempted to destroy it instead of reforming it why then he would oblige all the doubty Hectors in Virtue a numerous Multitude of false Braves who would infallibly stand Buff for him and be his Bully Backs on occasion He knew of old the Catalogue of those who were Enemies to Satyr and he knew that all the  Enemies to Satyr were so to the  English  Stage  Sunt quos genus hoc minime juvat utpote plures  Culparidignos quemvis media erue turba  Aut ob avaritiam aut miserâ ambitione laborat  Hic nuptarum insanit Amoribus hic puerorum  Hunc capit Argenti splendor stupet Albius aere  Hic mutat merces surgente à Sole ad eum quo  Vespertina tepet regio quin per mala praeceps  Fertur utipulvis collectus turbine ne quid  Summa deperdat metuens aut ampliet ut rem  Omnes hi metuunt versus odere poetas  I know Sir that you understand the Original very well and therefore I will not pretend to interpret  Horace  to you litterally but I desire your leave to make some Observations upon him by way of Paraphrase which will set his Sense in a clearer Light and convince you of this important Truth that all who would appear what they are not are mortal Enemies to Comedy because the Comick Poet is perpetually upon the hunt for Originals and every one would  be glad to play the Fool or the Knave in quiet without being singled from the Herd  Sir I shall at present trouble you but with two of these Characters of  Horace  not only because I am sensible that I begin to tire you but for Reasons which I shall hint to you anon but those two Characters I desire that I may set before you with the same Additions with which Time has transmitted them to us and by altering them made them modern  The First is he  Qui ob avaritiam laborat  A gogling snarling groaning praying Rogue though at the same time an Usurer and an Extortioner a Fellow so notoriously given to cheating that he defrauds even himself of Necessaries who can dine on a Prayer as Sir  John Denham  says and sup on an Exhortation one who makes a StalkingHorse of Religion and lies sculking behind it with no other Purpose than to draw WildGeese within his Reach  The other Sir is he  Qui mutat merces  c A biggotted StockJobber or a Fanatick Monopolizer a Fellow that devoutly calls up his Family to Repetition on  Sundays  and as devoutly makes them his Tools to smuggle and cheat the Queen on the WeekDays A Person who will stick at no manner of Villany but is kindly contented to be damn'd only that his great boobily Boy may get half a dozen Claps  half a score Surfeits lose half his Estate at the GroomPorters be cheated of the other half by Sharpers who are Under SpurLeathers and jog on to the Devil a little more gayly than his Father In the mean time this goodnatur'd Father leads a most exemplary Life In the Morning while his Servants are busie at the Waterside he walks about the City to pull down PlayBills cheat those who deal with him to cause all the Beggars that he finds in his way to be whip'd tho' at that very time he is going to augment the Number of them to visit WatchMen Headboroughs and PettyConstables and charge them that if they find any handsome Whore upon their Watch they should bring her to him the next Morning and least the Constable or the Watch should have a wambling to her themselves for such things he remembers have been formerly done he reads a long Lecture to them against Concupiscence and then goes home and gravely dines with his Family The Afternoon he passes in walking from Tavern to Tavern in which he drinks above twenty Nipperkins in as many several Kitchens to see that there is no Swearing nor no Prophaness there but that People as he thinks it behoves good Christians get devoutly and religiously drunk till growing more and more inflam'd with Canary and Zeal and being full of them  both he is oblig'd at last to disembogue himself which he does of each by spewing and preaching in turns And after he has thus performed his Duty to the Publick and fortified himself for the better Performance of private Duties he goes home like a good Man to fast and pray with his Family I say to fast Sir not out of Covetousness or Superstition but that he may secure the Chastity of his Daughters by mortifying the Old Man in them and the Youths of his Family  But Sir by your shaking your Head and your biting your Lip I am to believe you mistake me I am not here for making a Satyr upon the City I know very well that this City is the only true and solid Foundation of the  English  Strength Nor am I such a Fool as to believe that Sense or Honour are confined to Place I am my self acquainted with a great many Citizens who are very estimable Members of the Commonwealth I know several among them who are not only Men of Sense and Honour but of Wit and Pleasantry I know several of them whose true Zeal for Religion is shewn by all that engaging Charity that attractive Humility and lovely Meekness which are the only Signs of a good Christian And for such true Christians whether they may belong to the Church or MeetingHouse no Man has a  greater Respect than I have who judge of Mens Devotion not by the Errors of their Understandings but by the Sincerity of their Hearts But every Hypocrite to talk in Mr  Collier  's extraordinary Dialect is the Displeasure and Disease of my Eyes I hunt him as  Boileau  says as a Dog does his Game and as soon as ever I smell him I bark immediately And with Submission to you Sir I believe I am in the right of it and that the Hypocrites in Christian Warfare ought to be more severely handled than a Strumpet or a Libertine as we treat an open declar'd Enemy less rigorously than a Spy That the number of Hypocrites in the City is very great the Men of true Devotion there will be the first to acknowledge 'Tis to the Level of them that Mr  Collier  has particularly writ Every thing in his  short View  his  Defence  and his  Dissuasive  appears to be adapted to them the Sophistry of his Deductions the equivocating and prevaricating of his Citations the Finicalness of his Language and the Pharisaical Arrogance of his Zeal By gaining of these he knew he should compass both the Ends for the which he writ The first of which was that he should engage a numerous Party to make a Noise and to bully for him of which he did not fail  For it is notoriously known that in the late Reign several Persons of the foremention'd  Stamp who pretended to meet together for the support of the Laws and the Government discharg'd their Malice in a publick manner against several Gentlemen of known Loyalty and  English  Principles only that they might do an acceptable thing to a Man whom they knew to be a mortal Enemy to the present Establishment  The other End that Mr  Collier  probably propos'd to himself by exasperating the noisie and clamorous Part of the City against the Theatres might be to animate them against the People of Quality whose Presence supports them and the Court whose Authority protects them That this is no chimerical Conjecture may be thought by any one who takes a short View of Mr  Collier  's Principles For from this Proceeding he might easily foresee one of these two Consequences For upon these Clamours and Outcries either the PlayHouses would be suppress'd or they would be protected If they were suppress'd he easily saw the Gentry would be disoblig'd and that would be a pretty handsome Step towards some farther Reformations and Alterations But if upon these Clamours they were not suppress'd why then he had a great deal of Reason to hope that the City would grow sullen and sower And if their being out of Humour was of such dangerous Consequence in the Days of Brother  Pryn  of blessed Memory when the Court appear'd to have so little Occasion for them he believ'd that it might be of greater Moment now when he knew that by the Necessity of the Times the Court was oblig'd to demand their Assistance frequently  Sir you have often told me with extream Goodness that you requir'd no Obedience to any Commands that you laid upon us if they did not appear to be reasonable because God himself you have been pleased to tell us required only our reasonable Service But Sir can you believe it reasonable that I should be of another Man's Opinion against my own Sentiments when it appears so plainly that he is not of his own For Sir can any thing be more evident than that Mr  Collier  is moved to write against the Stage by another Motive than that which he pretends His Motive perhaps may be human Policy but it can never be Charity or perhaps 'tis Spleen or Covetousness or Pride or Arrogance or Fear I say Fear Sir For has not Mr  Collier  Reason to apprehend the Stage as well as Hypocrites of the foremention'd Characters For is it not evident that at the same time that he is setting up for a FirstRate Reformer he has shewn to the World that he is but a FifthRate Comedian And while he pretends to condemn Acting upon the Stage is Acting a Part  upon the Stage of the World so aukwardly and so ridiculously that all who are furnish'd with common Sense have found it to be Comedy For whom does he pretend to reform Is it not the People as I observed before whose Religion he abhors and whose Government he hates And does he not know very well that by reforming our Manners he would run Counter to his own Designs and Wishes because Reformation of Manners would confirm the present Establishment both in Church and State and can he then really design to reform us But how does he propose to himself to bring this about Why not by suppressing Vice but the Stage that scourges and exposes it For he meddles not with that Vice that is in the World let it be never so  flaming and outragious  For Example the crying Sin of  England  next to Hypocrisie at this time is Gaming a Sin that is attended with several others both among Men and Women as Lying Swearing Perjury Fraud Quarrels Murders Fornication Adultery Has not Gaming done more Mischief in  England  within these last five Years than the Stage has done in Fifty For when Women have lost vast Sums at Play which they have been afraid to own to their Fathers or Husbands have they not often been known to pay them after a shameful way How can the most inveterate Biggot  pretend that Gaming is fomented or encouraged by the Stage Must he not on the contrary be obliged to own that it is censur'd and corrected by it What is the Reason then that Mr  Collier  neglecting so important and so dangerous a Vice against which no Body has said one Word reserves all his Rage for the PlayHouse And takes an Occasion from the late Tempest to threaten us with some terrible Vengeance from Heaven if it is not immediately supprest Can any thing be more ridiculous than this from him For does not he wish for the greatest Vengeance that Heaven can send down upon us Can any Vengeance be inflicted on a Protestant and Free People more terrible than Slavery and Idolatry Is not the late Tempest though dreadful in it self yet a very Trifle compared to those Tho' the late Storm should return  and Nature should once more appear to be in her last Agony and the World be ready to expire  would not every one who has Noble  English  Principles chuse rather to see it perish than to lose his Religion and his Liberty Besides Has the late Tempest any thing to do with the Business of the PlayHouse What can Mr  Collier  mean then by threatening us with terrible Vengeance at the same time that he wishes it and by engaging us in frivolous and groundless Dissentions endeavours all  that he can to bring it on us at the very time he pretends to avert it  If Mr  Collier  's Zeal were sincere he would neither go about to frighten us with things which it is plain that he is not afraid of nor neglecting more dangerous Crimes would he attack the less Besides it is plain that he himself has not that Opinion of the Stage into which he would fool and delude us For if the Cause of the Stage were so bad as he would make us believe or if it were out of Charity that he attack'd it what need he make use of notorious Falshood to decry it 'Tis a pleasant Charity that engages a Man to be damn'd himself to reform others Besides what Occasion has Truth to have Recourse to Falshood which may sometimes indeed support Falshood but must always to discerning Eyes render Truth suspected  You know Sir that it is easie for me to prove that in this short Letter addrest to you Mr  Collier  has Recourse to Falshood For can any thing be more plain even from the Artifice of his Address to you Does not he here to make the World believe that he has the  Countenance of Figure and Fortune  Palm you upon the Town for a Person of Quality who are only a private Gentleman  If Mr  Collier  is mov'd by Charity to exclaim thus loudly against the Stage let me  ask him one Question Who are the Persons whom he designs to reform They who never come to a PlayHouse methinks should have no Occasion for his Corrections If his Design is on those who come thither why does he not insinuate himself into their Affections by the Meekness and Humility of his Expressions and the attractive Language of Charity Why has he Recourse to such presumptuous Arrogance is justly renders him the Aversion of some and the Scorn of others With him an Audience which you very well knew Sir is often one of the most venerable and awful Assemblies that can any where be found is  Assembly of Rakes and Strumpets Buffons are the Poets and the Players Liber  ines Does he believe that such Language  proper to work upon these People or to provoke them and exasperate them and  ender them deaf to Argument and Persasion  Besides there is something in Mr  Collier  's Style with which Truth is almost incompatible and that is Affectation which  always false Truth is plain and simple  nd natural and as she can have no De  ect in her is but hid by Ornament 'Tis  rue when we convey her to the Under  tanding by the Passions we sometimes give her Ornament But then that Ornament must be in Nature and consequently  true But Affectation is always false and can no more consist with Truth than Darkness can with Light What I have observed of Man in general may be said of Writers That Affectation is a certain Sign in them of want of Sincerity or of Understanding and very often of both  But Mr  Collier  's is the most affected most foppish Style that ever I met with in Ancient or Modern Authors of which I will undertake to convince any impartial Man if he is but a tolerable Judge of Writing  But to return from Words to Things I have not time enough to display the perpetual Sophistry of his Inferences or rather his no Inferences for a Metaphor or an Allegory is with him an Argument and so is often an Hyperbole But I shall say a Word of his more than Jesuitical prevaricating in his Authorities I shall only insist upon two the one of which he brings from Old and the other from Modern  Rome  Pray Sir let me see Mr  Collier  's Letter Ay here the Authorities are  The Republick of  Rome  before  Julius Caesar  stopt the building of a Theatre being fully convinc'd that this Diversion would bring in Foreign Vice that the old  Roman  Virtue would be lost and the Spirits of th  People emasculated  To prove this he refers his Reader to his  Defence of the short View  That is he endeavours to support the Sham which he puts upon the World now by that which he put upon it five Years ago 'Tis true after all Mr  Collier  speaks the Truth here but 'tis dash'd and brew'd with a Vengeance 'Tis true the  Romans  did stop the building of a Theatre before the Time of  Caesar  But would he pass this upon us for one Act of the  Roman  People or for their constant Sense If for their constant Sense their constant Practice proves that it was quite contrary If for one Act of what Validity can that possibly be against their constant Sense  Is not Mr  Collier  now a most shameful Hypocrite For does not he know that the  Romans  had the highest Veneration for Plays imaginable Is not every SchoolBoy who has read  Terence  convinc'd of it Do not his Comedies tell us by their Titles that they were part of the Religion of that People That they were all acted at their Funeral Ceremonies or at the Festivals of their Gods  That which he has said of Q  Elizabeth  another pious Fraud a meer religious Banter But I know that you who are so well acquainted with the History of our Nation must be already satisfied of it  But the Pope has lately shut up the Theatres in  Italy  Can any thing be more absurd than this Has the Pope lately shut up the BawdyHouses Or does he continue to lay a Tax upon Sin and to give them Spiritual Licenses 'Tis very certain he does What then would Mr  Collier  conclude from this that the Government here ought to license BawdyHouses and to suppress PlayHouses because the Pope takes the same Method  I think Sir I have made it plainly appear that Mr  Collier  is one who has Reason to be afraid of Theatres and therefore to hate them For he is one of those with a Vengeance who endeavour to appear what they are not And tho' nowadays a Priest is not suffer'd to be brought upon the Stage yet I question whether he is to be regarded as a Priest who wears a Sword of five Foot long and a Peruke of three and goes about reforming in the same Habit in which the  French  Dragoons are at this very Juncture piously reforming the  Cevennois  Thus Sir I desire that I may have leave to continue to be a Friend to our Theatres since I have clearly shewn that Mr  Collier  is not from his Heart their Enemy especially since I am convinc'd that the PlayHouses with all their Immorality and with  all their Faults may be instrumental to the reforming so profligate an Age as this  Thus Doctor I have sent the sum of the Objections which were made by  Charles  to which I desire your Answer that the Boy who is hot and opinionated may not run on in his Error  As soon as he had done I took  Harriet  to task Daughter said I you see the Case is very hard upon you and the rest of your Sex for thus the Doctor puts it  Either the Ladies are pleas'd with the Indecencies of the Stage or they are not If they are pleas'd 'tis a hard Imputation on their Virtue If they are not pleas'd 'twill be enquir'd why they come there  For his Part  He confesses that he has not Logick enough to disengage you  While I spoke this I perceived some great Alteration in her you would have worn  her Imagination had been shock'd her Aversion put into a Fit and that she underwent much Fatigue of Fancy and Mor  ification  To speak more vulgarly the Blood began to spring up into her Face  er little Breasts began to heave and she  arted a Frown that made her awful ev'n  me her Father He wants Logick to  isengage us said she with a disdainful  ir after I had just repeated those very Words why then he shall find that I have  ore than he has and that I who have not  yet reach'd my seventeenth Year am able to make a very just Apology in behalf of my self and all the Women of Condition in  England  whom he has so basely affronted Tho' we are not pleas'd with the Indecencies or Immoralities of Plays yet notwithstanding that we frequent them because some Diversion is absolutely necessary for us and because perhaps ev'n modern Plays with all the Faults imputed to them are the most innocent of the Diversions which the Town affords  The Diversions that the Town affords are chiefly reduc'd to four Gaming MusickMeetings Balls and Meetings for Dancing Going to Plays Now of all these I am apt to believe that Plays are the most innocent for the following Reasons They raise the Passions only to correct them whereas the others raise 'em merely for the sake of inflaming them The Plays and more especially Tragedies instruct us in Virtue which the other Diversions do not They improve us in lawful innocent Knowledge which in some measure supplies the want of Education in our Sex They form our Language and polish our Minds and so capacitate us when we come to marry to engage and endear our Husbands to us For we every Day see that only Fools are constant long to Fools Sir in short the Case is thus Diversions the  Ladies of a great Metropolis must have I have particulariz'd the several Diversions which this Town affords All the Danger and all the Temptation which this judicious Person supposes to be at the PlayHouse are really in all the other Diversions which have none of the Advantages that may be reap'd from Tragedies for the Improvement either of our Virtue or Knowledge Why then would this mighty Reformer have us leave Plays for them Would he have us have no Diversion or would he have us make choice of those which have the most Temptation  True Sir there are Passages in some of our Plays which I could heartily wish were out But does he think the Virtue of the Ladies who frequent PlayHouses is so very weak as to be o'erthrown by the Lusciousness as he calls it of a Scribler's  Double Entendre  What have so many great Examples as we find on the Stage so many noble and generous Sentiments so many accomplish'd Patterns of Virtue have all these no manner of Power to rouze to strengthen and inflame our Virtue and shall two or three wretched Equivocals three or four miserable  Double Entendres  have the force to corrupt us  If any of my Sex happen to find themselyes so infirm as this worthy Reformer appears to own that he is if two or three ridiculous  double meanings have Strength enough to undo them in spight of those exalted Heroick Characters which in my Opinion should be enough to fix our Affections to that degree that nothing that we meet with abroad in the World should have the Power to move us if any of my Sex are so infirm let them in God's Name keep away from our Theatres But I find no such scandalous Weakness about me I can despise a Fool who thinks to entertain me with his sordid playing on Words but at the same time can be entertain'd with Wit and good Sense and more with the Innocence of true writ Humour and I can be both pleas'd and mov'd with the excellent Scenes of an Instructive Tragedy Does this judicious Person really believe that the Conversations which we find in the World are Virtue and Purity all The Food of the Mind like that of the Body is not all of it fit for Nourishment But strong Virtue like strong Nature knows how to discern and separate to reject the Bad to assimulate the Good by which it is fed and supported If any of my Sex have the scandalous Weakness to have their Virtue and their Honour endanger'd by the Folly of  Double Entendres  I would advise them to take their leaves of the PlayHouse But at the same time I would advise Mr  Collier  to persuade his noble Patrons of the  Reforming Club to erect a Protestant Nunnery for them for nothing less can secure them For they who are found so strangely weak as to be warm'd by a meer painted Fire how can they ever stand against the real Flames of Love  How many extraordinary Women may  England  boast of since Plays were introduc'd among us Among whom are three of the greatest Queens that ever the World produc'd and all of them took delight in Plays How many Ladies of inferior Rank have frequented and still frequent 'em who yet in Proportion are fam'd for every Virtue What does this charitable Person believe of our Mothers our Aunts and Grandmothers Does he believe them Adulteresses all because they frequented the PlayHouse But you Sir have Justice to believe better You knew my Mother true to your Bed as she was dear to your Arms And I beseech you to have the Goodness to believe that tho' like her I frequent our Theatres I will be always Heir to her Virtue as I am to her Likeness  This Doctor was the Sum of what  Harriet  said before she went to the Play News is just now brought me that she is come back from that horrid Place and is gone with  Charles  to my Lady  Freeloves  and that her Ladyship has sent for me  Ah dear Doctor let me see you Tomorrow to receive some Consolation from you For here have happen'd two of the most unfortunate things in the World For News is brought me from  Piccadilly  that  Jack  has lost a thousand Pound at Picket and  Susan  who went into the Garden forsooth to meditate tho' she went out as black as a Raven being in Mourning for her Great Aunt yet as I hope for Mercy the Jade is return'd as white and as powder'd as if she had been hard at work in a BoltingHouse So that I could wish that for this one Night they had both been with  Harriet  and with  Charles  at the Tabernacle of the Wicked  I am Dear Doctor Yours  c  POSTSCRIPT  SINCE I writ this I have seen a Letter written by you tho' without Name to Mrs  She designs to return you an Answer as soon as some little Affairs will give her leave In the mean while she says that in the hurry in which your Letter seems  to be writ you overlook'd the first part of the Passage which you quoted from Doctor  Tillotson  and therefore she desir'd me to transcribe it and to send it you with this which in Obedience to her Commands I have done and it is as follows Tillot  Serm  Vol  To speak against them    viz  Plays  in general may be thought too Severe and that which the present Age cannot so well brook and would not perhaps be so just and reasonable because it is very possible they might be so fram'd and governed by such Rules as not only to be innocently diverting but instructing and useful to put some Vices and Follies out of Countenance which cannot perhaps be so decently reprov'd nor so effectually expos'd and corrected any other way  TO Mr HUNGERFORD  SIR  I Desire you not to give your self the Trouble to send any Boat from the Country tomorrow for your Humble Servant If I find my self in a Condition to make you a Visit I will rise betimes in the Morning and walk But I am afraid to venture the cold of the Water so early in the Morning Next to the cold of the Water I dread the Heat after I come on Shore I dread the Company which you too often keep there who are apt to be excessively warm in a false and foolish Cause  If any one has a mind to be satisfy'd of this he need only repair to a certain Mansion where they meet about three times a Week to endeavour to talk wisely together▪ and where they never fail to discover greater Weakness than they were capable of when they were Boys For which of them▪ when they were but ten Years of Age  would not have chosen at any time to have plaid rather than to have been under the Lash at School It was Nature's Voice that made them prefer gay Liberty to mournful Slavery When they were Boys it was with great Reluctance that they were obedient to Age and Gravity that govern'd them for their Good and now the Sots are growing old they long to have a Younker who will certainly ruine them for their absolute Master They are every Day endeavouring to prove that they are Beasts and belong to that Younker as his unalienable and indefeasible Chattels that he has even a Right Divine that is a Commission sign'd by God to use them like errant Dogs not like  English  BullDogs for they are generous Creatures and will fly in the Face of any one who dares to use them ill but like errant Spaniels who the more they are beaten the more they crouch and the more they fawn upon their Tyrannick Masters I will say nothing of the Business concerning which you wrote to me till I wait on you and am  Your  c  London  March  TO Mr R * * *  SIR  I Desire that you would give your self no trouble about the drinking Quaker For I find upon Reflection that since I voluntarily gave up the Note 'tis below me to demand the Debt  'Tis true indeed the Note was given up when there was little Hope of his paying the Money and he has now beyond all Expectation an Estate left him 'Tis true likewise that the Money was lent in his pressing Necessity and lent in order to do him a signal Kindness which it actually did and 'tis as true that I who lent him the Money had often before and have often since both fed him hungry and cloath'd him naked The Note was given up with a Promise that he should pay the Money if ever he came to be able for which I then told him that I depended on his Honour and his Integrity But notwithstanding all this if he has not one Spark of Conscience  or common Honesty which may oblige him to pay this Money of his own Accord I ought to have Generosity enough not to demand the Debt 'Tis true this would vex some People in my Case But I consider that perhaps the poor Wretch cannot help it for as 'tis in my Nature to oblige 'tis in his to be ungrateful But then on the other side as 'tis in his Nature to know no Friend to own no Benefactor and to serve no God but Interest 'tis in mine heartily to scorn such a Rascal and the vile God whom he serves  I am Your  c  May  To * * * *  Esq  Upon the first publishing the  Guardians  NOT being able to come I write to you resolving to be with you one way or other As soon as you left me Yesterday I sent for

 as in the  Spectator  or a  Tertian  as in the  Tatler  for I pray'd to Heav'n to defend us from a  Quartan  because that might make Dulness lasting Upon the Arrival of the Papers I found that it was a  Quotidian  not without Joy for old  Hippocrates  tells us somewhere that tho' a  Quotidian  proceeds for the most part from Phlegm yet is it of no long Continuance I perceive by the Beginning of the second Paper that  Teague  has chang'd both his Name and his Country being as I suppose asham'd of the latter But the Mischief of it is that he shews the true one by the adopted one  he latter being almost as ridiculous a one as the former He was born he tells us  a lone House within half a Mile of the Metropolis of the two Kings of  Brentford  make no doubt but that the more he discovers

Heathen Name  Nestor  I cannot imagine unless he thought that that wise Name would set off his Folly and make it look more ridiculous But  Teague  apparently took the Sirname from his real  Hyberniin  Appellation or the inflexible Obstinacy of his own Temper As I have the extraordinary Honour to be acquainted with him I am about to write a learned Letter to him in which I design to reproach him little for his too constant Gravity in his  ew Production and to let him know that Squire  Ironside  is too grave and too serious  Offspring of his ludicrous Ancestors  hat the Reader complains that he meets with nothing at all to divert him in it no Consort of Musical Instruments playing up  n one another not so much as a Couple  Pipes broke by the violent Agitation of  Jig at his Neighbour's House nor any waggish Enumeration of the several Bran  es of the Noble Family of the  Sides  as  that fine facetious Person his Grandfather number'd but with a wonderful deal of Wit I must needs say the several Branches of the  Staffian  Race which Neglect or which Delay I shall boldly tell him that his numerous Relations take very ill that Sir  Hector Backside  makes a Noise about it that that old Tarpawlin  Bully Broadside  roars at it Mr  Humphrey Wrongside  grumbles at it Mr  Abraham Weakside  is much dissatisfied even waggish  Jack Fireside  takes it amiss and his own Namesake  Nestor Blindside  will never be Friends with him more I shall let him know that even the Females of his adopted Race resent it that the courteous Lady Mrs  Cheapside  receives no small Disquiet from it that that welldispos'd Lass Mrs  Bedside  very much complains of it that that obstreperous Carrion  Moll Waterside  stuns the Ears of all that approach her with it and that that impudent Jade  Doll Commonside  has her Back as high as her Belly about it  But you must know Sir that this arduous Undertaking is not carryed on by  Teague  alone but by a Triple League I shall give you an Account of the two other Confederates by the first Opportunity  I am SIR Your  c  TO Mr WALTER WEST  SIR  I Return you my hearty Thanks for your friendly Endeavours to serve me on  Saturday  but am amaz'd at the Brutality of that Captain of Farce  who not only refus'd to witness the Receipt but to open my Letter saying that it was out of his Sphere I must confess a Brute acts in a narrow Sphere and Civility and Humanity are out of that Sphere If it were any other Person but Captain  one would find him out after this Affront serve him as  Hudibras  did  Whachum  and attack the Apartment of Honour in him  Whachum  his SeaCoal Prong threw by  And basely turn'd his Back to fly  But  Hudibras  gave him a twitch  As quick as Lightning in the Breech  Just in the Place where Honour's lodg'd  As wise Philosophers have judg'd  Because a Kick in that part more  Hurts Honour than deep Wounds before  But the Captain is a privileg'd Person and what he does like what he says is only fit to be laugh'd at But as his Folly and infinite Baseness are only fit for Contempt Your Generosity and Humanity merit all my Esteem and have oblig'd me to be always  SIR Your most Humble Servant JOHN DENNIS  March  TO Mr JAC TON Sen  On the Conspiracy against the Reputation of Mr DRYDEN  SIR  WHEN I had the good Fortune to meet you in the City it was with Concern that I heard from you of the Attempt to lessen the Reputation of Mr  Dryden  and 'tis with Indignation that I have since learnt that that Attempt has chiefly been carried on by small Poets who ungratefully strive to eclipse the Glory of a great Man from whom alone they derive their own faint Lustre But that Eclipse will be as Momentary as that of the Sun was lately The Reputation of Mr  Dryden  will soon break out again in its full Splendor and theirs will disappear It was upon hearing of this A'ttempt that I reflected with some Amazement that I  should have got the Reputation of an illnatur'd Man by exposing the Absurdities of living Authors and Authors for the most part of great Mediocrity tho' I have always done it openly and fairly and upon just and personal Provocations and that these should basely arraign the Reputation of a great Man deceas'd who now can make no Answer for himself and upon whom they fawn'd while living and should yet escape uncensur'd But when I heard that that Attempt was in favour of  'tis impossible to express to what a height my Indignation and Disdain were rais'd Good God was there ever any Nation in which I will not say a false Taste for we never had a true one but in which a wrong Sense and a fatal Delusion so generally prevail'd For have not too many of us lately appear'd to contemn every thing that is great and glorious and to praise and exalt every thing that is base and infamous Have not too many of us shewn to all the World by a manifest execrable Choice that they prefer Weakness to Power Folly to Wisdom Poverty to Wealth Fury and Madness to Moderation Infamy to Glory Submission to Victory Slavery to Liberty Idolatry to Religion the Duke of  O  to the D of  M  the Pretender to the Royal  George  our only rightful King and Mr  to Mr  Dryden  If I appear too warm I hope you  will excuse my Affection for the Memory and my Zeal for the Reputation of my departed Friend whom I infinitely esteem'd when living for the Solidity of his Thought for the Spring the Warmth and the beautiful Turn of it for the Power and Variety and Fulness of his Harmony for the Purity the Perspicuity the Energy of his Expression and whenever the following great Qualities are requir'd for the Pomp and Solemnity and Majesty of his Style  You may now see Sir by this Letter how little most Men know one another who converse daily together How many were there in Mr  Dryden  's Lifetime who endeavour'd to make him believe that I should be the foremost if I surviv'd him of all his Acquaintance to arraign his Memory whereas I am he of all his Acquaintance who tho' I flatter'd him least while living having been contented to do him Justice both behind his Back and before his Enemies Face am now the foremost to assert his Merit and to vindicate his Glory  If Mr  Dryden  has Faults as where is the Mortal who has none I by searching for them perhaps could find them But whatever the mistaken World may think I am always willing to be pleas'd nay am always greedy of Pleasure as any  Epicurean  living and whenever I am naturally touch'd I give my self up to the first Impression and  never look for Faults But whenever a criedup Author upon the first reading him does not make a pleasing Impression on me I am apt to seek for the Reason of it that I may know if the Fault is in him or in me Wherever Genius runs thro' a Work I forgive its Faults and wherever that is wanting no Beauties can touch me Being struck by Mr  Dryden  's Genius I have no Eyes for his Errors and I have no Eyes for his Enemies Beauties because I am not struck by their Genius  I am SIR Your  c  June  To Mr * * *  SIR  AS I came Home in the Coach on  Friday  Night I ruminated upon the Passage in Mr  Waller  's Verses to my Lord  Roscommon  and found indeed that the Words are not strictly reconcileable to Purity of  English  and  Grammar  but then there are several Passages in  Virgil  and  Horace  which are as little in the compass of a regular Construction for Example that in the Eclogues  Et certamen erat Corydon cum Thyrside magnum  And that Passage in the fifth of the  Aeneis  where  Nisus  says to  Aeneas  Quae munera Niso  Digna dabis primam merui qui laude coronam  Ni me quae Salium Fortuna inimica tulisset  Where  merui  is certainly for  meruissem  and so  Virgil  makes bold not only with the Mood but the Tense For my Part I am for preserving the Purity of Language ev'n in the boldest Flights of Poetry but then I am apt to be indulgent to the Faults of great Masters not only because they are few but in Consideration of the Pleasure which they have otherwise given me He would be but an illnatur'd Man who after having had the Pleasure of enjoying a fine Woman should fall to finding Fault with her Moles or some other Blemishes which perhaps after all are only so many Shadows to set off her ravishing Beauties  I was not a little surpriz'd at the Question whether Mr  Waller  's Verses to  Amoret  mov'd me What if they dont Is there not the  pulchrum  as well as the  dulce  in Poetry But  Horace  perhaps you'll say is for having them both in the same Poem  Non satis est pulchra esse Poemata dulcia sunto  Et quocunque volunt animum Auditoris agunto  But then he is certainly speaking of Tragedy otherwise he must damn most of his own Odes For ev'n of those which are writ to Women there is but one which has a great deal of Tenderness and yet most o the rest are undoubtedly very fine After all the  pulchrum  in Poetry moves as certainly as the  dulce  but then the first moves the Enthusiastick Passions as the latter does the vulgar ones Yet to come at last close to the Question the Verses to  Amoret  move even the vulgar Passions in me as they ought to do It being impossible to take a Survey in them of Mr  Waller  's Goodnature and his Gratitude without pitying and loving him  I am Your most obedient Servant John Dennis  Oct  To the EXAMINER  Upon his wise Paper of the Tenth of January  IT was upon the fourth of this instant  February  that I was persuaded by some of my Acquaintance to peruse thy Paper of the tenth of  January  in which as they told me it was surmis'd by several that you pretended to father upon me the Letter called  the  Englishman  's Thanks to the Duke of  Marlborough It was the second of thy Papers that I ever read tho' I have handled several of them Thou seem'st to have a great Genius for Water Language and to be aiming at the Post and Reputation of Water Orator which thou wilt fill as worthily as  Taylour  did that of Water Poet But tell me truly what does thy Execrability mean From whence this Pride this Insolence this Arrogance What hast thou said what hast thou writ what hast thou done to give thee the least Shadow of a Pretence to it Art thou such an Ideot to be of Opinion that thou art the only soulmouth'd Fellow in  England  Is it so  hard a matter think'st thou to cry  Blockhead stupid Head  the most insipid and contemptible of Mankind Is there any Thought any Invention any Understanding of thine requisite for the making use of these Flowers of Rhetorick Is not a Joker in a long partycolour'd Coat as capable of all this as a Joker in a long black Coat Thou say'st that I shall die without knowing that I am the most insipid and contemptible of all Human Creatures Thou art in the right of it I shall die without knowing any thing of this tho' I live to the Age of  Methusalem  if I hear it from none but thee and such scribling Slaves as thou art But thou before thou diest wilt know a great deal worse than this of thy self Before thou diest thou wilt know that thou art the most insipid the vilest and most contemptible I will not say of all Human Creatures for Reason thou never hadst and Humanity thou hast long disclaim'd but the vilest and most contemptible of all Dogs for tho' the rest of thy Species bark like thee at the worthiest of Men who are Strangers to them and crouch and fawn like thee upon the vilest of Men whom they know yet no Dog but thy self did ever first fawn and crouch and afterwards bark and bite and betray no never any Dog was so vile before as to fawn upon a Master thro' two Kingdoms and afterwards to fly at his Throat  Thus have I shewn thee what thou art and while thou art reading each Period of this thy Conscience will be thy Check and will heartily cry  Amen  to it As for me thou art not to be told that I have the Approbation and Applause and Esteem of thy Masters thy Masters who use thee like a common Whore abhor and detest thee while they use thee and will command their Servants to kick thee out of Doors as soon as the Lust of their Ambition is satisfied  I thank my God I am altogether a Stranger to thy Person but give me leave to shew thee how insipid and contemptible thou art as an Author Insipid Panegyrists are they who praise with general Compliments and threadbare Commendations Compliments which are equally applicable to all Subjects and to use which demanded neither Imagination nor Judgment And 'tis these Panegyrists that have been chiefly the Marks of  Boileau  's judicious and generous Satyrs Insipid Libellers are they who use general Injuries and  Billinsgate  Defamations and which the errantest Fool may speak of the most illustrious Person as easily as a Dog can bark at the Moon Thou art one of those insipid Libellers and art by so much more odious and more despicable than an insipid Panegyrist by how much a Blockhead with Illnature is more  hateful and more contemptible than a Fool with good Humour  The insipid Reproaches which thou usest have been utter'd a thousand times by thy self of a thousand different Persons But I shall say that of thee which every one cannot say and shall say what can be said of none but thy execrable self alone and when I have dragg'd thee from the lurking Hole to which thy base Fears have condemn'd thee for thou never hadst Sense enough to have Shame and expos'd thee to the open Light that is to eternal Infamy then let the World judge who is the insipid and who the contemptible  By thy Impudence thy Ignorance thy sophistical arguing thy pedantick declamatory Style and thy brutal  Billinsgate  Language thou canst be none but some illiterate Pedant who has liv'd twenty Years in an University by thy being a turbulent hotbrain'd Incendiary a hotbrain'd Incendiary with a cool Heart one may easily guess at the University which gave thee thy Education By thy wonderful Charity thou canst be nothing but a scandalous Priest hateful to God and detestable to Men and agreeable to none but Devils who makest it thy Business to foment Divisions between Communities and private Persons in spight of that Charity which is the fundamental Doctrine of  that Religion which thou pretendst to teach How amazing a Reflection is it that in spight of that Divine Doctrine the Christian World should be the only part of the Globe embroil'd in endless Divisions From whence can this proceed but from Priests like thee who are the Pests of Society and the Bane of Religion But 'tis not enough to say thou art a Priest 'tis time to point out what Priest thou art Thou art a Priest then who mad'st thy first Appearance in the World like a dry Joker in Controversy a spiritual Buffoon an Ecclesiastical  Jack Pudding  by publishing a Piece of waggish Divinity which was writ with a Design to banter all Christianity yes thou nobly began'st as  Judas Iscariot  ended began'st by crucifying thy God afresh and selling him to  John Nutt  for ten Pound and a Crown and so underselling half in half thy execrable Predecessor Hadst thou but had half his common Sense thou hadst had his Remorse and consequently his Destiny instead of which thou fell'st from selling and betraying thy God to selling and betraying thy old Friends So that hadst thou liv'd in the time of  Judas  thou wouldst infinitely have surpss'd him in Villany thou woulst have betray'd both Christ and all his Apostles nay wouldst have undermin'd and undersold and betray'd even  Judas  the Betrayer himself  When thou wert come piping hot from betraying both Friends and God thou wert often heard to cry most impudently but most truly out that the Church was in Danger Any one may swear when it has such Priests that 'tis not in Danger but upon the very brink of Ruine and that if it were not supported by God himself it would immediately tumble  Yet 'tis hard to be angry with such a Miscreant when I reflect that he who has us'd me so has us'd his God worse For thou hast denyed his very Being which is to degrade him below the meanest of his own Creatures not only below Fools and Ideots but even below Vermin Insects Mites and all the Creatures of the material invisible World even below the  Examiner  For Nothing must always be less than Something let Something be never so little  Thou hast fall'n upon me with the Rage of a mad Dog or a Mohock not because thou hadst any Provocation but because thy Madness made thee believe that the first thing that came in thy way was the Cause of thy Uneasiness Nothing is more certain than that I knew nothing of the Letter to the Duke of  Marlborough  till the fourteenth of this instant  February  which according to thy own Account was five Weeks after it was publish'd I shall live to see thee cry Penny Papers before thou  wilt see me write them Yet if I had writ that Paper I would boldly have own'd it in spight of thee and of all thy Abettors What shall I be afraid or asham'd to commend the greatest Man upon Earth when thou art neither afraid nor asham'd most basely to calumniate him But go on in the Course thou art in I cannot wish thee a greater Curse Go on to calumniate and to vilify all that is truly great and illustrious and to flatter and to extoll all that is vile and despicable Whatever Thoughts thou either hast or wouldst seem to have of me I would have thee to know that God and Nature have placed me infinitely above doing thy base Drudgery and being the contemptible execrable Tool of any Party whatever If it be true that a Kingdom divided against it self shall not stand if intestine Division be the Flaw that lets in Death to a mighty Nation what Damnation must that wholesale Cutthroat deserve who makes it the sole Business of his Life to incense one miserable Half against the unfortunate other Yet this I'll say for thee that tho' thou art the worst of Murderers in thy Heart yet Thanks to thy Impotence thy Hands are entirely free and what  Dryden  maliciously said of  Shadwell  is truly applicable to none but thee And so I bid thee heartily farewell  LETTERS upon the Sentiments of the two first Acts of CATO  To Mr C  LETTER I  SIR  AFter I had endeavour'd to shew the absurd Conduct of the Tragedy of  Cato  by the  Remarks  which were printed by  Bernard Lintott  the numerous Idolizers of that Tragedy whose unparallell'd Zeal was the Child of their unparallell'd Ignorance shelter'd themselves under the Beauty of the Sentiments of that Poem Upon which I who knew the Sentiments to be at least as absurd as the Conduct wrote two long Letters to a learned and judicious Friend by which I endeavour'd to shew the Sentiments as incongruous as the Conduct When I acquainted you with this at Mr  W  's House you were pleas'd to declare that you desir'd to see a Copy of those Letters And when upon that  I acquainted you by what poor Artifice I had been depriv'd of the Copy of those Letters as my Friend had been of the Original you seem'd desirous to see as many of the lost Remarks as I could recollect which in compliance with your Desires I shall send you from time to time as I can recollect them hoping that they may appear solid to one who has shewn so much Justness in all the Judgments you have made of things of this nature but desiring at the same time that you would not expect any thing ev'n of that little Force and that little Grace of Expression which they might have in the two foremention'd Letters for which I have not time and for want of which I promise to make what Amends I can by the Solidity of my Remarks and by the Shortness of my Letters  First then I desire to know whether the exclaiming against  Pharsalia  so often in this Tragedy two Years after that Battle had been fought in a different and distant part of the World and but two Days after the Battel of  Thapsus  which was fought at the very Gates of  Utica  and by the loss of which the present Danger of the People in  Utica  was occasion'd is not as absurd as it would have been in the Marshal  de Villeroy  to have cryed out after the Defeat at  Ramelies Blenheim Blenheim  oh  Blenheim  And we have the more reason to  ask this Question if we consider that it was  Pompey  who commanded at  Pharsalia  but it was  Cato  who commanded at  Thapsus  If any one happens to answer here that the Defeat at  Pharsalia  destroy'd the Flower of the Republican Army and con+sequently was the occasion of the Defeat at  Thapsus  to that I answer that the Defeat at  Thapsus  was not occasion'd by the Overthrow at  Pharsalia  For at that rate much more might the Overthrow which happen'd afterwards in  Spain  be attributed to the two Defeats at  Thapsus  and  Pharsalia  whereas 'tis very plain that in  Spain  notwithstanding the two former Defeats  Caesar  's Army had been defeated by young  Pompey  's if young  Pompey  had not been vanquish'd by  Caesar  For it was the invincible Spirit of  Caesar  which got the Day which his Army had certainly lost if they had fought under any other General Besides suppose that we were oblig'd to own that the Defeat at  Thapsus  was occasion'd by that at  Pharsalia  yet the Author could draw nothing from that but a false Politick Reflection for as great Passion is occasion'd by great Surprize it always dwells upon the last Disaster But I begin to run into length which I would industriously avoid You shall have more by the first Opportunity  I am SIR Your  c  Nov  On the Sentiments of CATO  LETTER II  SIR  IN sending these Remarks upon the Sentiments of  Cato  to you I shall rathe  endeavour to entertain you with frequen  Letters than to fatigue you with long ones▪ that you may still leave off if not with  Appetite yet without that Disgust whic  attends great Satiety  To come then to the Matter witho  any more ceremony I desire to kno  whether that Sentiment of  Marcus  in t  first Scene of the Play  Love is not to be reason'd down or lost  In high Ambition or a thirst of Greatness  is not false in it self according to th  Reflection of  Rochefoucault On passe so  vent de l'Amour a l'Ambition mais on  revient gueres de l'Ambition a l'Amour  ▪ and whether 'tis not most abominable  one who just before had profess'd himse  a Stoick which Sect of Philosophers pretended by the Force of Reason to extirpate all the Passions  The first Speech of  Sempronius  to  Portius  begins thus  Good Morrow  Portius  let us once embrace  Once more embrace whilst yet we both are free  Now are not these formal Embraces between two People who saw one another every Hour something upon the Comique  But what  Portius  says to this is still more whimsical  My Father has this Morning call'd together  To this poor Hall his little  Roman  Senate  The Leavings of  Pharsalia    Still starping upon  Pharsalia  Now to whom does he tell this extraordinary piece of News why to the only Senator who makes any figure in that Assembly ridiculous or not ridiculous so that if the Senate was called together that Morning he had been certainly summon'd But this Senate methinks was very early summon'd 'Tis now not above half an Hour after Daybreak  But why the Leavings of  Pharsalia  why still harping upon  Pharsalia  when 'tis evident  from History that this mock Senate this Senate in Burlesque was compos'd of a Parcel of Scoundrels who had never seen  Pharsalia  For can you or any one believe that if they had been of real Senatorian Rank  Caesar  would have us'd them as he did who hang'd up as many of them as fell into his Hands But let us now see what  Sempronius  is pleas'd to reply to  Portius  Not all the Pomp and Majesty of  Rome  Can raise her Senate more than  Cato  's Presence  O my  Portius  Could but I call that wond'rous Man my Father  Would but thy Sister  Marcia  be propitious  To thy Friend's Vows I might be blest indeed  Port  Alas  Sempronius  would'st tho  talk of Love  To  Marcia  while her Father's Life's i  danger  Thou might'st as well court the pale trembling Vestal  When she beholds the Holy Flame expiring  Sempr  The more I see the Wonders of thy Race  The more I'm charm'd Thou must take hee  my  Portius  The World has all its Eyes on  Cato's  Son  Thy Father's Merit sets thee up to View  And shews thee in the fairest Point of Light  To make thy Virtues or thy Faults conspicuous  Port  Well dost thou seem to check my ling'ring here  On this important Hour  Now was ever such a Consequence drawn from such an Antecedent For let us consider the genuine Meaning of what was said before by  Portius  and what was answer'd by  Sempronius  Port  Alas  Sempronius  would'st thou talk of Love  To  Martia  while her Father's Life's in danger  Thou might'st as well court the pale trembling Vestal  When she beholds the Holy Flame expiring  Semp  The more I see the Wonders of thy Race  The more I'm charm'dThou must take heed my  Portius  The World has all its Eyes on  Cato  's Son  hy Father's Merit sets thee up to View  nd shews thee in the fairest Point of Light  make thy Virtues or thy Faults conspicuous  Now what were these Wonders of  Ca  s  Race why their Stoicism their Apa  y their curbing their Passions by the Force  of their Reason For what occasion'd this Speech of  Sempronius  and this Caution which he gives to  Portius  Why what but  Portius  's declaring the Resolution of his Sister  Martia  not to admit of any effeminate unworthy Passion while her Father's Life is in danger So that methinks  Portius  might reasonably have interpreted this Caution of  Sempronius  as a Reprimand for his own extravagant and unreasonable Passion and not have construed it as a Design to send him on an  April  Errand to harangue a poor Parcel of drunken Sots before they were out of their first Sleep But as we observ'd in the printed Remarks the Author wanted to be rid of  Portius  to make Room for  Syphax  and so thrust him out with as little Ceremony as  Manly  did my Lord  Plausible  I am Your  c  On the Sentiments of CATO  LETTER III  SIR  TO enter into Matter without Ceremony I should be glad to know your Opinion of what  Syphax  tells  Sempronius  in the Beginning of the Scene between them in this first Act  Syph  Sempronius  all is ready  Ive sounded my  Numidians  Man by Man  And find them ripe for a Revolt They all  Complain aloud of  Cato  's Discipline  And wait but the Command to change their Master  Now where's the Policy or the Prudence of sounding them Man by Man The  ommon Soldiers obey their Commanders  d 'tis dangerous to trust a Conspiracy with too many But when did  Syphax  do  his 'Tis but half an Hour after Day  reak when he says this If he had done  the Day before methinks  Sempronius  his  FellowConspirator should have known it overnight since  Caesar  was so soon expected and  Sempronius  himself seems to be of that Opinion  Believe me  Syphax  there's no time to waste  Ev'n while we speak our Conqueror comes on  And gathers Ground upon us ev'ry Moment  Alas thou knowest not  Caesar  's active Soul  With what a dreadful Course he rushes on  From War to War In vain has Nature form'd  Mountains and Oceans to oppose his Passage  He bounds o'er all victorious in his March  The  Alpes  and  Pyreneans  sink before him  Thro' Winds and Waves and Storms he works his Way  Impatient for the Battel One Day more  Will set the Victor thundring at our Gates  so that according to this 'tis plain that  Syphax  ought to have acquainted  Sempronius  overnight with the Inclination which his  Numidians  had to revolt provided he had sounded them the Day before and how he could sound them Man by Man by Night in a Town of War as  Utica  was is something hard to conceive But to dwell no longer on this If all the  Numidians  were thus at the Command of  Syphax  how comes  Sempronius  so earnest about the gaining  Juba  as he is in the Remainder of this Speech  But tell me hast thou yet drawn o'er young  Juba  That still wou'd recommend thee more to  Caesar  And challenge better Terms  But Sir how comes  Sempronius  in the foregoing Speech to use this Language to  Syphax  Alas thou know'st not  Caesar  's active Soul  when 'tis plain from the Scene in the first Act between  Syphax  and  Juba  that the former is so very well acquainted with the Character and Manners of the present  Romans  in general and when 'tis plain from the Scene between  Juba  and  Syphax  in the second Act that  Syphax  was so very well acquainted with the Manners and Actions of their remotest Ancestors  Juba  Wouldst thou degrade thy Prince into a Ruffian  Syph  The boasted Ancestors of these great Men  Whose Virtues you admire were all such Ruffians  This Dread of Nations this almighty  Rome  That comprehends in its wide Empire's Bounds  All under Heav'n was founded on a Rape  Your  Scipio's Caesar's Pompey's  and your  Cato's  These Gods on Earth are all the spurious Brood  Of violated Maids of ravish'd  Sabines  Now is it possible that a Man who talks at this Rate should be unacquainted with the Character of  Caesar  who was the greatest Captain that ever had been in the World and whose Actions had made so much noise in the World for so many Years together Is it possible that any one now alive should be acquainted with the Manners and Actions of the very first Princes of the  Savoy  Family and should be a Stranger to the Character and the Actions of Prince  Eugene  But Sir I cannot imagine for what Reason  Sempronius  should appear thus solicitous for the drawing over  Juba  into this Conspiracy  But tell me hast thou yet drawn o'er young  Juba  That still would recommend thee more to  Caesar  And challenge better Terms  when 'tis plain from the Soliloquy of  Sempronius  in the sixth Page of this first Act  Edit  that the principal Motive that  engag'd  Sempronius  in this Conspiracy was the possessing  Marcia  Cato  has us'd me Ill He has refused  His Daughter  Marcia  to my ardent Vows  Besides his baffled Arms and ruined Cause  Are Barrs to my Ambition  Caesar  's Favour  That show'rs down Greatness on his Friends will raise me  To  Rome  's first Honours If I give up  Cato  I claim in my Reward his Captive Daughter  Now  Juba  was not only  Sempronius  his Rival but  Sempronius  knew that he was so as 'tis plain from  p  of the first Edition  Act    Semp  Syphax  I now may hope thou hast forsook  Thy  Juba  's Cause and wishest  Marcia  mine  Now 'tis evident that since  Sempronius  expected to possess the Daughter by betraying the Father to  Caesar  how comes he to appear so earnest to reconcile his Rival to  Caesar  Semp  Be sure to press upon him every Motive  Juba  's Surrender since his Father's Death  Would give up  Africk  into  Caesar  's Hands  And make him Lord of half the burning Zone  Now Sir did you ever hear of a duller Lover or a more stupid Plotter than this  Sempronius  who being engag'd in a Conspiracy against  Cato  by the Motives of Love and Ambition appears zealous to reconcile a pow'rful Rival to  Caesar  who being reconcil'd would infallibly traverse him in his Passion and consequently in his Ambition Can any thing be more plain than that  Caesar  who sacrific'd ev'ry thing to his Interest and his Ambition would sacrifice both the Passion and Ambition of  Sempronius  to him who was able  To make him Lord of half the burning Zone  And can any thing be more manifest than that  Juba  if once reconcil'd to  Caesar  would unless he were more stupid than  Sempronius  use all his Interest with  Caesar  to hinder his Rival from mounting as he propos'd to himself to the first Honours of  Rome  least those Honours should be as it were so many steps towards his succeeding in his Passion for  Marcia  But I have exceeded the Bounds to which I propos'd to confine my self in ev'ry Letter and am till the next Opportunity  SIR Yours  c  On the Sentiments of CATO  LETTER IV  SIR  I Come now to the Scene between  Juba  and  Syphax  being the fourth Scene of the first Act which you have heard so extravagantly commended When I come to shew you that the Author has manag'd Matters with so much Dexterity that the whole Scene is one gross Fault that  Syphax  is very much in the wrong in his Invectives against the  Romans  that  Juba  is more in the wrong in his Defence of them what shall we say of the Taste and Judgment of its Admirers shall we forbear to cry out with Indignation  Quantum est in rebus inane  First then I come to shew that  Syphax  is very much in the wrong in his general Invective against the  Romans  For do but consider what the Design of  Syphax  was in this Conversation with  Juba  his Design was to draw over  Juba  to the Party of  Caesar  according to the Request which  Sempronius  made him no less than twice in the foregoing Scene  But tell me hast thou yet drawn o'er young  Juba  That still wou'd recommend thee more to  Caesar  And challenge better Terms  p Edit  and in the next Speech but one  Be sure to press upon him ev'ry Motive  Juba's  Surrender since his Father's Death  Would give up  Africk  into  Caesar's  Hands  And make him Lord of half the burning Zone  And as soon as  Syphax  remains alone he says  I'll try if yet I can reduce to Reason  This headstrong Youth and make him spurn at  Cato  The Time is short  Caesar  comes rushing on us  But hold young  Juba sees  me and approaches  Now the first Speech of  Syphax  in this Scene between him and  Juba  contains a general Invective against the  Romans  Syph  'Tis not my Talent to conceal my Thoughts  Or carry Smiles and Sunshine in my Face  When Discontent sits heavy at my Heart  I have not yet so much the  Roman  in me  Now Sir the Question is whether an Invective against the  Romans  in general is a probable Method to induce  Juba  to espouse that part of them which either was or at least pass'd for the most profligate part of them with all the impartial World and more particularly with  Juba  The Question is whether an Invective against the  Roman  Fraud and Hypocrisie was likely to make  Juba  desert  Cato  whom all the World allowed to be sincere and to bring him over to  Caesar  who was renown'd for the Artifice of his Dissimulation  But as  Syphax  is very much in the wrong in this general Invective against the  Romans  in general  Juba  's infinitely more so in his Defence of them For  Syphax  is not in the wrong absolutely but only with relation to the Design with which he speaks for absolutely speaking he is so far from saying too much against them that he does not speak a hundredth Part of the Truth And what  Juba  says in Defence of them does by no means belong to the  Romans  who liv'd in  Juba  's Time but to those who liv'd in the  Vigour of the Commonwealth The  Romans  who liv'd in  Juba  's Time were the most profligate Race of People that ever liv'd in the World which will easily appear by the Account that is given of their Manners by their own discerning and impartial Historian  Sallust  in his History of the  Catilinarian  War As you have the Works of that Prince of Historians by Heart there is no Occasion for repeating the Passage I appeal to you therefore if 'tis not manifest from the Account which  Sallust  gives of them that the Reflection of  Syphax  in the foregoing Speech is not the hundredth Part of what his Contemporary  Romans  deserv'd and whether it does not appear likewise from the same Account that the following Sentiments of  Juba  are not only false but base  Jub  Why dost thou cast out such ungen'rous Terms  Against the Lords and Sovereigns of the World  Dost thou not see Mankind fall down before them  And own the Force of their superior Virtue  Is there a Nation in the Wilds of  Africk  Amidst our barren Rocks and burning Sands  That does not tremble at the  Roman  Name  But let us see what  Syphax  replies to this Speech of  Juba  Syph  Gods where's the Worth that sets this People up  Above your own  Numidia  's tawny Sons  Do they with tougher Sinews bend the Bow  Or flies the Javelin swifter to its Mark  Launch'd from the Vigour of a  Roman  Arm  Who like our active  African  instructs  The fiery Steed and trains him to his Hand  Or guide s in Troops th' embattled Elephant  Loaden with War These these are Arts my Prince  In which your  Zama  does not stoop to  Rome  The Preheminence over other Nations to which the  Romans  ow'd the Extent of their Empire did not proceed so much from the superior Strength or Address of their Individuals consider'd as Individuals as from their publick and military Discipline However what  Syphax  says here would not be so very impertinent if the Design of  Syphax  were to draw  Juba  off from the  Romans  in general but as I said before I cannot imagine how he can pretend by these means to draw  Juba  off from that Party of the  Romans  which he believ'd the juster and to make him espouse that part of them of the Justice of whose Cause he had no manner of Opinion  But now Sir let us come to what  Juba  replies to  Syphax  in the Defence of his  Romans  Juba  These all are Virtues of a meaner Rank  Perfections that are plac'd in Bones and Nerves  A  Roman  Soul is bent on higher Views  To civilize the rude unpolish'd World  And lay it under the Restraint of Laws  To make Man mild and sociable to Man  To cultivate the wild licentious Savage  With Wisdom Discipline and lib'ral Arts  Th' Embellishments of Life Virtues lik  these  Make Human Nature shine reform the Soul  And break our fierce Barbarians into Men  Now Sir are you able without a just In+dignation to behold in  Juba  this base Ad+miration of a Nation which in its Progres to universal Monarchy endeavour'd to en+slave the very Kings of  Africa  as it ha  done those of  Europe  and  Asia  before Th  truth of it is that wherever the  Romans  this time of day carried their Arms the  taught the Nations their Luxury their Ra+pines their Frauds their civil Dissention  and in short all the deplorable Corruptio  of their Manners and  Syphax  might hav  answer'd him a thousand Times more full  than he does in the following Speech  Syph  Patience kind Heav'nsExcus  an old Man's warmth  What are these wond'rous civilizing Arts  This  Roman  Polish and this smooth Behaviour  That render Man thus tractable and tame  Are they not only to disguise our Passions  To set our Looks at variance with our Thoughts  To check the Starts and Sallies of the Soul  And break off all its Commerce with the Tongue  In short to change us into other Creatures  Than what our Nature and the Gods design'd us  Here are not above two or three of the Sentiments which are found in the foremention'd Account of  Sallust  whereas that admirable Historian employs whole Pages in describing the prodigious Corruption of the  Roman  Manners  In the following Speech  Juba  pretends to convince  Syphax  of the Virtue of the  Romans  in general I mean of the  Romans  who were his Contemporaries by the Virtue of  Cato  as if there were any Conclusion from the Virtue of one Man to the Virtue of a whole Nation one might as reasonably conclude from the Understanding of one Man to the Understanding of a whole Nation one might as reasonably conclude that the  Thebans  were the brightest People of  Greece  because  Pindar  was the greatest of the Lyrick Poets as that they were naturally the bravest People of  Greece  because  Pelopidas  and  Epaminondas  were perhaps the greatest Captains of their Time We have shewn already that the  Romans  of those Times were so far from being more virtuous than other People that they were more profligate in their Manners than any other Nation whatever  The Virtue of  Cato  therefore such as it was must have been owing to something else than the national Virtue of his Cotemporary  Romans  It was owing perhaps to an Affectation of the austere Virtue of his Ancestors to  Grecian  Philosophy to an overgrown monstrous Pride which appears ev'ry where throughout his Character to the Obstinacy of an inflexible Temper and perhaps I might add to likewise invincible Ignorance I mean an utter Ignorance of the Condition and Constitution of his Country and of the Changes that had been made in it by the Alteration of their Manners by the loss of their  Agrarian  and by prolongation of Magistracy so that the  Roman  Liberty in  Cato  's Time was in a desperate Condition and was irretrievable unless by absolute Power  It was never to be recover'd by  Cato Caesar  alone could rest ore it  Cato  had only the impotent Will but  Caesar  alone had  the Power The merry way of reasoning in this Scene puts me in Mind of an Observation which  Rapin  makes upon the  French  Poets his Contemporaries that Logick was so much neglected in their Poems that they were for the most part either Fustian or Nonsense but I forget my Promise and transgress my Bounds The Remainder of this Scene must make the Subject of another Letter which I promise to send you as soon as I have leisure to think of it  I am SIR Your  c  On the Sentiments of CATO  LETTER V  SIR  THE last time I had the Satisfaction to write to you I was oblig'd to break off my Remarks in the middle of the Scene between  Syphax  and  Juba  which is the fourth of the first Act Being encourag'd by your Approbation of what I have already sent you I shall now examine the Remainder of that Scene  In the th Page  Syphax  urges  Juba  to abandon  Cato  as you may see in the following Dialogue  Juba  What would'st thou have me do  Syph  Abandon  Cato  Juba  Syphax  I should be more than twice an Orphan  By such a Loss  Syph  Ay there's the Tie that binds you  You long to call him Father  Marcia  's Charms  Work in your Breast unseen and plead for  Cato  No Wonder you are deaf to all I say  Juba  Syphax  your Zeal becomes importunate  I've hitherto permitted it to rove  And talk at large but learn to keep it in  Least it should take more Freedom than I'll give it  Now Sir can you see here without smiling that  Syphax  makes a Proposal to his Prince which the latter believes to be downright villainous and yet does not provoke him but as soon as the other touches upon his Love for  Marcia  the Milksop takes Fire and shews that he cannot bear it  But now Sir let us see what  Syphax  says upon this Resentment of  Juba  Syph  Sir your great Father never us'd me thus  That is as much as to say that his Father never reprimanded him for his Insolence and his Presumption but see how he proceeds  Alas he's dead but can you e'er forget  The tender Sorrow and the Pangs of Nature  The fond Embraces and repeated Blessings  Which you drew from him in your last Farewel  Still must I cherish the dear sad Remembrance  At once to torture and to please my Soul  The good old King at parting wrung my Hand  His Eyes brim full of Tears then sighing cry'd  Prithee be careful of my Son His Grief  Swell'd up so high he could not utter more  Now Sir 'tis plain from this Speech that  Syphax  was present at the last parting between the Son and the Father Let us see now whether  Syphax  can make mention of this last parting between the Son and the Father for any other reason than to work upon the Weakness of his young Master and to put him out of his princely Senses Not considering that the mention of that parting if he supposes his Younker had common Sense would render the Insolence and the Presumption which  Syphax  shews by urging  Juba  to abandon  Cato  inexcusable and insupportable because at that parting at which we have just now shewn that  Syphax  was present the Father strictly charges the Son never to abandon  Cato  This is evident from what  Juba  says in the Scene between him and  Cato  in the second Act where  Juba  gives the other a Relation of what happen'd at the last parting between his Father and himself in the following Words  My Father when some Days before his Death  He order'd me to march to  Utica  Alas I thought not then his Death so near  Wept o'er me press'd me in his aged Arms  And as his Grief gave way My Son said he  Whatever Fortune shall befall thy Father  Be  Cato  's Friend he'll train thee up to great  And virtuous Deeds Do but observe him well  Thou'lt shun Misfortunes or thou'lt learn to bear them  But now the Son in this Scene between him and  Syphax  in the first Act upon the Mention which  Syphax  makes of this Parting seems entirely to have forgot that Admonition of his Father of which he makes so circumstantial a Relation to  Cato  in the d Act To be convinc'd of this let us see what he answers to what  Syphax  said last to him  Juba  Alas thy Story melts away my Soul  That best of Fathers How shall I discharge  That Gratitude and Duty which I owe him  Syph  By laying up his Counsels in your Heart  Juba  His Counsels bad me yield to thy Directions  What when those Directions were point blank contrary to his own as they apparently are here But what follows  Then  Syphax  chide me in severest Terms  Vent all thy Passion and I'll stand its Shock  Calm and unrufled as a Summer's Sea  When not a Breath of Wind flies o'er its Surface  Thus  Juba  as I said above has either entirely forgot that Admonition of his Father of which he makes so circumstantial a Relation to  Cato  in the d Act or has not Capacity enough to know that what  Syphax  brings as an Excuse for his Insolence ought to render it insupportable But now Sir let us see what  Syphax  says upon this melting Tenderness of  Juba  Syph  Alas my Prince I'd guide you to your Safety  Jub  I do believe thou would'st but tell me how  Syph  Fly from the Fate that follows  Caesar  's Foes  Juba  My Father scorn'd to do it  Syph  And therefore died  Juba  Better to die ten thousand thousand Deaths  Than wound my Honour  Syph  Rather say your Love  Juba  Syphax  I've promis'd to preserve my Temper  Why wilt thou urge me to confess a Flame  I long have stifled and would fain conceal  Now Sir I desire to know how  Syphax  and  Sempronius  should come to know of this Flame if  Juba  had long stifled it and would fain conceal it For as  Sempronius  tells us in the third Act no one had Access to  Marcia  but  Juba  and her Brothers And if  Juba  had never confess'd any Passion the Brothers sure would not talk of any such thing before they were certain of it tho' perhaps they might have guess'd at it and certain they could not be before the Declaration of  Juba  For what remains tho' this Character of  Juba  is not so faulty with relation to the Rules as some which I mentioned in the  Remarks  which were formerly publish'd by  Lintott  yet is it more faulty absolutely and consider'd in it self For  Juba  is a Character that is not only shocking and contemptible to Men of Sense at the same time that the Author endeavours to render him estimable and agreeable but he is shocking and contemptible by the very same Qualities by which the Author endeavours to render him estimable and agreeable and these are his Esteem and Admiration of  Cato  and of the  Romans  For in admiring  the  Romans  who were his Contemporaries he not only admir'd the most profligately wicked of all Nations as we have shewn above by the Testimony of their noblest Historian but a Nation who in their Progress to universal Monarchy were about to ruin and enslave  Numidia  and the rest of  Africa  as they had done  Europe  and part of  Asia  before And as to that Esteem and Veneration and almost Adoration which he shews for  Cato  we have this one Remark to make that he thinks and acts directly counter to him even in those very Qualities for which he pretends to admire him For the most shining Qualities in  Cato  's Character were the Love of his Country and the Command which he had of his Passions  Now Sir for the first of these Qualities give me leave to observe that  Cato  was a Lover of his own Country and not of  Numidia  and he and his  Romans  design'd to subdue  Numidia  to  Rome  and not  Rome  to  Numidia  If  Syphax  had been a loyal Subject and a true Friend to his Prince and not a false Traitor and a Friend to  Rome  he would have advis'd his Prince to have defied both  Caesar  and  Cato  and the  Romans  in general and taking this Advantage of their civil Dissensions to have retreated into his own  Numidia  and to have rows'd up all the Nations between the Tropicks against those accursed Plagues of Human  Race who design'd to sacrifice the Happiness and the Virtue of Mankind to their insatiable Avarice and their detestable Ambition And  Juba  had follow'd that Advice if he had been wise or magnanimous enough to have had any Regard for his own Royalty and his Independency or had been a true Patriot enough to have had half so much concern for the Liberty and Happiness of  Numidia  as  Cato  had for that of  Rome  Now as for the other Quality of  Cato  the Command of his Passions  Juba  is so far from commanding his own that thro' an unparallell'd Impotence of Mind he chuses that very Day to make a Declaration of his Passion for  Marcia  and to gain her Father's Consent which is apprehended to be the very last both of  Roman  Liberty and of her Father's Life And this Weakness of his is exposed the more and render'd the more contemptible ev'n by what  Portius  says to  Marcus  in his Praise in the first Scene of the Play  Behold young  Juba  the  Numidian  Prince  With how much Care he forms himself to Glory  And breaks the Fierceness of his native Temper  To copy out our Father's bright Example  He loves our Sister  Martia  greatly loves her  His Eyes his Looks his Actions all betray it  But still the smother'd Fondness burns within him  When most it swells and labours for a Vent  The sense of Honour and desire of Fame  Drive the big Passion back into his Heart  So that  Juba  it seems after having for some time stifled his Passion chuses that very Day to declare and divulge it on which Reason and Decency oblig'd him most of all to conceal it  By the way Sir I desire leave to observe that for  Portius  to declare that  Juba  loves his Sister  Marcia  and not only loves her but greatly loves her that his Eyes that his Looks that his Actions all betray that Love that tho' he is silent the smother'd Fondess burns within him even when it labours most for a Vent and that he is restrain'd from divulging it by the sense of Honour and the desire of Fame I say for  Portius  to declare all this when it appears that  Juba  has not only made no mention of it before that Day but declares it upon the only Day in which the sense of Honour and desire of Fame forbid such a Declaration are Sentiments that appear to me to be visionary and fantastick It seeming to me to be equally selfevident that nothing could make such a Declaration in  Juba  dishonourable before that Day and that nothing could  have hinder'd it from passing for Infamous then  Thus Sir have I given you an Account of the Absurdities and the Inconsistencies which are to be found in the Sentiments of the first Act of the Tragedy of  Cato  I shall proceed to the second Act with the first Opportunity  I am SIR Your  c  On the Sentiments of the second Act of CATO  LETTER VI  SIR  YOU could not have us'd a more prevailing Argument to oblige me to continue my Remarks upon the Sentiments of  Cato  than the assuring me that those which I have already sent you upon the Sentiments of the first Act have not been displeasing to you I shall proceed then to the second Act and entring upon the Subject without any more Ceremony I shall desire to know from you whether the first Scene of the second Act that is the Scene which shews the Senate assembled deserves the Applause which it met with at first from the Reader and the Spectator In order to the answering this Question let us consider the Design with which  Cato  who presides o'er it summon'd this Assembly Let us consider next the Manner of speaking in it and lastly the Speeches themselves  The Design of  Cato  is to consult this Assembly about Peace or War which he does without so much as once consulting them about the Means of carrying it on or so much as once asking their Advice about it And yet  Caesar  was expected in a few Hours at the Gates of  Utica  a Town not maintainable against  Caesar  's Army as we may learn by the very first Lines of the Play  The Dawn is overcast the Morning low'rs  And heavily in Clouds brings on the Day  The great th' important Day big with the Fate  Of  Cato  and of  Rome  For how could that Day be big with the Fate of  Cato  and of  Rome  if  Utica  were  a Capacity to hold out a Siege against the Arms of  Caesar  But Sir let us consider the Manner of speaking in this Assembly As soon as  Cato  proposes the Business of Peace or War  Sempronius  rises and declares for the latter when  Cato  immediately contradicts him without staying to see if the rest of the Senators were of his Opinion which is contrary to the Method of all Councils either those of  Parnassus  or those of the World because such a Proceeding is not consonant to Reason nor to the Design of convening such Assemblies  For the very Design of convening such Assemblies and of asking their Advice is that every Man who is ask'd it should give it sincerely and without Prepossession Now is it not plain Sir that if he who has the supream Authority in a Council declares his Opinion before the rest they who speak after him are in some measure byass'd  But now let us come to the Speeches themselves and let us begin with  Cato  's  Fathers we once again are met in Council  Caesar  's Approach has summon'd us together  And  Rome  attends her Fate from our Resolves  How shall we treat this bold aspiring Man  Success still follows him and backs his Crimes▪  Pharsalia  gave him  Rome Egypt  has since  Receiv'd his Yoke and the whole  Nile  is  Caesar  's  Why should I mention  Juba  's Overthrow  And  Scipio  's Death  Numidia  's burning Sands  Still smoak with Blood 'Tis time we should decree  What Course to take Our Foe advances on us  And envies us ev'n  Libya  's sultry Desarts  Fathers pronounce your Thoughts are they still fixt  To hold it out and fight it to the last  Or are your Hearts subdu'd at length and wrought  By Time and ill Success to a Submission  We will begin to examine this Speech by the Tayl for 'tis not till the four last Lines that  Cato  puts the Question to this mock Senate whether they were for Peace or War which is putting a wrong Question For as long as they had a Ressource and the Affairs of the Commonwealth were not desperate as appears by what  Cato  and  Juba  say in the sequel all true Patriots ought to be for War and the only Question which could be put properly to them was since  Caesar  approached and  Utica  was not maintainable by their Forces against his numerous and victorious Army to what Places they should immediately retreat and where they might best and soonest recruit their Forces All the first part of the Speech is Declamation and telling his Hearers tho' neither he nor they had a Minute to lose  Caesar  being expected every Hour what either was not true or what they must every one of them know every Jot as well as himself Besides could any thing be so little to his Purpose as that at this extraordinary Juncture which required that he should use all his Art and all his Force to animate them he should remind them thus of the Felicity and the constant Success of  Caesar  and enumerate the Battels he had gain'd and the Countries he had conquered which was enough to make them lose all Courage and incline them to a base Submission If it has not that Effect on  Sempronius  'tis because he is a Traitor and does not speak his Mind that by persuading  Cato  to hold out he may have the Merit of delivering him up to  Caesar  Being ordered then by  Cato  to declare his Opinion he delivers it in the following Speech which is intended by the Author as a  Gasconnade  Semp  My Voice is still for War  Gods can a  Roman  Senate long debate  Which of the two to chuse Slav'ry or Death  No let us rise at once gird on our Swords  And at the Head of our remaining Troops  Attack the Foe break thro' the thick Array  Of his throng'd Legions and charge home upon him  Perhaps some Arm more lucky than the rest  May reach his Heart and free the World from Bondage  This as I said before is design'd by the Author as a  Gasconnade  But 'tis only its being in the wrong Place that makes it so For if this Speech had been spoke after  Cato  had declar'd against both making Peace and retreating it had been great and reasonable and  Roman  For this Advice of  Sempronius  is wrong because the Forces in  Utica  could before the Arrival of  Caesar  make a Retreat and recruit But after Refusal to make Peace and to make a Retreat there remain'd but two things either to go out and fight or to stay there till they were coop'd up by  Caesar  To stay there was foolish and desperate for  Caesar  might be certain to reduce them by Famine without suffering them so much as to strike a Stroke If they went out and fought they had a Chance for it tho' the odds was very great against them  Perhaps some Arm more lucky than the rest  May reach his Heart and free the World from Bondage  So that  Cato  having resolved neither to make Peace nor to retreat was oblig'd by Reason to follow this Advice of  Sempronius  Let us now see what Reasons he gives for his not doing it  Cato  Let not a Torrent of impetuous Zeal  Transport thee thus beyond the Bounds of Reason  True Fortitude is seen in great Exploits  That Justice warrants and that Wisdom guides  All else is tow'ring Frenzy and Distraction  Are not the Lives of those who draw the Sword  In  Rome  's defence entrusted to our Care  Should we thus lead them to a Field of Slaughter  Might not th' impartial World with Reason say  We lavish'd at our Deaths the Blood of thousands  To grace our Fall and make our Ruine glorious  Why no The World could not with reason say that he lavish'd at his Death the Blood of thousands for doing a reasonable thing that is by leading them out to fight against the Enemies of their Country by which they had a Chance for the Victory after he had resolv'd within himself neither to make Peace nor retreat The World might reasonably say that  He lavish'd at his Death the Blood of thousands  To grace his Fall and make his Ruine glorious  by basely deserting them that is by dying alone by dying by his own Hand without making a fair Retreat with them or making any Terms for them or fighting bravely at the Head of them If he had fall'n in the Field at the Head of them and the Deaths of thousands had attended on  his it would have been so far from making his Ruine glorious that it would have obscur'd it and would have render'd the Fall of  Cato  a vulgar Fall and common to those numerous Chiefs who in the several Ages of the World have been known to fall in Battel  Cato  knew very well that to grace his Fall and render his Ruine glorious with the unthinking part of the World both with his Contemporaries and with Posterity that the Singularity of his Fall was requisite that in order to this there was a Necessity for his falling alone for his falling by his own Hand after having twice read over  Plato  's Treatise of the Immortality of the Soul  But now Sir as  Sempronius  is in the wrong in declaring for War before he knew that  Cato  had resolv'd neither to make Peace nor make a Retreat as  Cato  is more in the wrong in answering him let us now shew that  Lucius  is still more in the wrong in the Harangue which he makes for Peace and  Cato  still more in the wrong than he in the Answer which he makes to that Harangue  Lucius  My Thoughts I must confess are turn'd on Peace  Already have our Quarrels fill'd the World  With Widows and with Orphans  Scythia  mourns  Our guilty Wars and Earth's remotest Regions  Lie half unpeopled by the Feuds of  Rome  'Tis time to sheath the Sword and spare Mankind  It is not  Caesar  but the Gods my Fathers  The Gods declare against us and repel  Our vain Attempts To urge the Foe to Battel  Prompted by blind Revenge and wild Despair  Were to refuse th' Awards of Providence  And not to rest in Heav'ns Determination  Already have we shewn our Love to  Rome  Now let us shew Submission to the Gods  The first six Lines of this Speech contain nothing but a meer poetical Flourish And for these two that follow  It is not  Caesar  but the Gods my Fathers  The Gods declare against us and repel  Our vain Attempts  May we not reasonably say that they are the Language of Baseness that it would be more Philosophical as well as more  Roman  to say that the Gods have only tryed them all this while to try with what Constancy they would bear their Sufferings and endure their Losses and whether they were  worthy to be made the Deliverers of their Country But let us proceed  To urge the Foe to Battel  Prompted by blind Revenge and wild Despair  Were to refuse th' Awards of Providence  And not to rest in Heav'ns Determination  Thus is this Fool in the other Extream as if there were no medium between urging the Foe to immediate Battel and a base Submission  Cato  will tell him in his Answer that there is that medium but will tell it him after such a manner that he had better have said nothing  Cato  Fathers I cannot see that our Affairs  Are grown thus desp'rate We have Bulwarks round us  Within our Walls are Troops enured to Toil  In  Africk  's Heats and season'd to the Sun  Numidia  's spacious Kingdom lies behind us  Ready to rise at its young Prince's Call  Thus  Cato  is sensible that there is a medium between urging the Foe to immediate Battel and a base Submission There is a retreat into  Numidia  where they may repair and recruit their Forces and then  it will be time to offer Battel and therefore this Stoick justly cries out  While there is Hope do not distrust the Gods  But what Inference does he draw from hence why the strangest one in the World  While there is Hope do not distrust the Gods  But wait at least till  Caesar  's near Approach  Force us to yield  That is as much as to say Since we have so fair a Retreat into  Numidia  whose spacious Kingdom does as it were extend its Arms to receive us why in the Name of all the Gods e'en let us stay here But let us suffer him to go on  'Twill never he too late  To sue for Chains and own a Conqueror  Why should  Rome  fall a Moment ere her time  No let us draw her Term of Freedom out  In its full Length and spin it to the last  But now Sir is that the way to spin the Freedom of  Rome  to the last to stay till they are coop'd up in  Utica  instead of retreating into  Numidia  where they may raise another Army with which they may  once more contend for the Liberties of their Country But let him make an end of this blessed Harangue  So shall we gain still one Day's Liberty  And let me perish but in  Cato  's Judgment  A Day an Hour of virtuous Liberty  Is worth a whole Eternity in Bondage  Why let it be so but then if a Day if an Hour of virtuous Liberty be of such immense Value sure an Age or many Ages of it are infinitely more to be esteem'd And why they should talk of adding a Day to the Liberties of  Rome  when they may reasonably hope to add whole Ages by retreating into a vast Kingdom which lyes open to receive them is I must confess above my Apprehension  But Sir tho' I have not quite done with this Scene of the Senate yet give me leave here to insert a Passage of the following Scene between  Cato  and  Juba  in order to shew that whereas those old Stagers  Sempronius  and  Lucius  made the one of them an extravagant Proposal and the other a base one young  Juba  who in all likelihood was never in the right before yet gives very reasonable Advice to  Cato  in the following Lines  Had we not better leave this  Utica  To arm  Numidia  in our Cause and court  Th' Assistance of my Father's pow'rful Friends  Did they know  Cato  our remotest Kings  Wou'd pour embattled Multitudes about him  Their swarthy Hosts wou'd darken all our Plains  Doubling the native Horrour of the War  And making Death more grim  To which reasonable Advice we shall see immediately that  Cato  gives a most unreasonable Answer  Cato  And canst thou think  Cato  will fly before the Sword of  Caesar  Reduced like  Hannibal  to seek Relief  From Court to Court and wander up and down  A Vagabond in  Africk  Which is as much as to say I consess that 'tis true by retreating immediately from  Utica  I may have an opportunity of recruiting my little Army in  Numidia  and rendring it still more pow'rful than it was at  Thapsus  and that consequently I may have yet another opportunity of consulting the Safety of my Friends and retrieving their Interest and their Pow'r and may yet once  more be in a Condition of contending for the Liberties of  Rome  and of Mankind yet rather than make this Retreat which may look little in the Eyes of the unthinking Part of the World I who pretend so much concern for my Friends and so much Love for my Country will rather suffer my Country to sink and my Friends to perish But for God sake Sir why this Aversion now from flying before the Sword of  Caesar  Who was it that flew from  Pharsalia  to  Africa  before the Sword of  Caesar  Was it not this very  Cato  But pray Sir what does he what can he mean by  Reduced like  Hannibal  to seek Relief  From Court to Court  Could he not have brought a nearer and a  Roman  Example to justifie and to sustain his Retreat Did not the Great  Pompey  after his Flight from  Pharsalia  seek Relief in  Africa  and seek Relief which he was not sure to find Shall  Cato  after this refuse to seek certain Relief in  Numidia  a Relief so necessary for the Preservation of his Friends and for the Support of sinking Liberty But what can be the meaning of  wander up and down  A Vagabond in  Africk  Did not the Great  Pompey  wander more like a Vagabond from  Pharsalia  to  Aegypt  being accompanied but by few as Vagabonds are often accompanied whereas  Cato  might be attended by Thousands by all the remains of the Forces in  Utica  whose Lives he might secure by his Retreat and whose Deaths he would certainly lavish by his Stay Which is prov'd by Fact and by the Event for  Caesar  hang'd as many of these worthy Senators as afterwards fell into his hands  But now 'tis time to go back to the Senate and to shew that upon the arrival of  Decius Cato  makes a more unreasonable and extravagant Proposal than either  Lucius  or  Sempronius  made before him  Decius  Caesar  is well acquainted with your Virtues  And therefore sets this Value on your Life  Let him but know the Price of  Cato  's Friendship  And name your Terms  Cato  Bid him disband his Legions  Restore the Commonwealth to Liberty  Submit his Actions to the publick Censure  And stand the Judgment of a  Roman  Senate  Bid him do this and  Cato  is his Friend  Now here Sir give me leave to ask one Question Did  Cato  believe that  Caesar  would comply with this Proposal or did he certainly know that he would reject it If he believ'd that he would comply with it must not this Stoick be Weakness it self If he certainly knew that he would reject it why then is this a Brave and a  Roman  Proposal or a Frantick and Extravagant one May not we here retort upon  Cato  what he himself said before to  Sempronius  Let not a Torrent of impetuous Zeal  Transport thee thus beyond the Bounds of Reason  True Fortitude is seen in great Exploits  That Justice warrants and that Wisdom guides  Is this a Proposal that Wisdom guides And does not  Decius  in the following Line very justly reproach him with acting so contrary to his known Character  Decius  Cato  the World talks loudly of your Wisdom  Is not this so far from being Wise that it is downright Ridiculous in one who will do nothing to obtain his Demands neither  ight bravely nor Retreat prudently nor propose any probable Conditions of Peace  Thus Sir in compliance with your Deire I have recollected and sent you the  chief Things which I had formerly remark'd upon the Sentiments of the two first Acts of  Cato  What was chiefly to be observ'd upon the Sentiments of the other three Acts fell in with the Method of the Remarks which I formerly publish'd on that Tragedy  I should now go back to the Scene in the first Act between  Juba  and  Syphax  and say something concerning that Pride which  Syphax  objects against  Cato  But this Letter being already swell'd to too great a Bulk I shall omit it 'till the next Opportunity  I am SIR Your  c  On the Sentiments of CATO  LETTER VII  SIR  I Shall now according to my Promise make an end of these Remarks by going back to the Scene in the first Act between  Juba  and  Syphax  In that Scene  Juba  boasts to  Syphax  of the Pow'r that  Cato  has to resist Pleasure  Syphax  answers that the Abstinence of his  Numidian  Hunters is as extraordinary as that of  Cato  to which  Juba  replies  Juba  Thy Prejudices  Syphax  won't discern  What Virtues grow from Ignorance and Choice  Nor how the Hero differs from the Brute  But grant that others could with equal Glory  Look down on Pleasures and the Baits of Sense  Where shall we find the Man that bears Affliction  Great and Majestick in his Griefs like  Cato  Heav'ns with what Strength what Steadiness of Mind  He triumphs in the midst of all his Suff'rings  How does he rise against a Load of Woes  And thank the Gods that throw the Weight upon him  Now here I desire leave Sir to make one Observation by the bye The Author makes this young  African  affirm implicitely here that 'tis harder to bear Affliction than to resist Pleasure whereas there are two Principles innate in us the one of which enables us to bear Affliction and the other inclines us to submit to Pleasure the one of which is Pride and the other the ardent Desire of Happiness and therefore  Rochefoucault  is in the right in his th Reflection▪  Il faut des plus grand Virtus pour souteni  la bonne Fortune que la mauvaise  Bu  now Sir I come to the chief thing of which I design'd to treat in this Letter and tha  is the Pride of  Cato  Let us see then wha  Syphax  says to  Cato  's Firmness under Af+fliction  Syph  'Tis Pride rank Pride and Haugh+tiness of Soul  Now here I would ask the Author one Question Did he design this Assertion of  Syphax  for Truth or Slander If he design'd it for Truth there is an end at once of all his Heroe's Virtue if he design'd it for Slander why then I desire leave to tell him that he has drawn his Hero so unhappily that what he design'd for Slander is apparently true for in the latter end of that Scene of the second Act where  Decius  appears  Cato  does not only think himself the greatest and most deserving of Mankind but is so foolishly vain and so intolerably insolent as to declare it to all about him  Dec  Does  Cato  send this Answer back to  Caesar  For all his generous Cares and proffer'd Friendship  Cato  His Cares for me are insolent and vain  Presumptuous Man The Gods take Care of  Cato  Wou'd  Caesar  shew the Greatness of his Soul  Bid him employ his Care for these my Friends  And make good use of his illgotten Pow'r  By sheltring Men much better than himself  Which is as much as to say  Caesar  shews Insolence and Vanity in taking Care of me but he would shew the Greatness of his Soul  in taking care of these Scoundrels here about me who are as much better than him as I am better than they are Now is not this to say in plain  English  As long as the Gods take care of me let the Devil take care of my Friends here For has not he painted  Caesar  but six lines before this as black as any modern can paint the Devil  Didst thou but view him right thou'dst see him black  With Murder Treason Sacrilege and Crimes  That strike my Soul with Horror but to name 'em  And so much for the Pride of  Cato  at least at present And now Sir let us return to what  Juba  said a little above and take Occasion from it to make one more Remark  Where shall we find the Man that bears Affliction  Great and Majestick in his Griefs like  Cato  Heav'ns with what Strength what Steadiness of Mind  He triumphs in the midst of all his Suff'rings▪  How does he rise against a Load of Woes▪  And thank the Gods that throw the Weigh upon him  Now the Truth of the Matter is that  Cato  shew'd less Strength and Steadiness in his Affliction than any of the conquer'd  Romans  who fled to  Spain  that they might reserve themselves for better Times and have one glorious Trval for Liberty more He was so far from rising under the Load that he impiously threw down the Burden and by poorly dying before the Word of Command acted the Part of a cowardly Soldier who flies from the Post where his General has plac'd him and leaves his Buckler behind him  Thus Sir have I sent you what remain'd to be said concerning the Sentiments of  Cato  Some of my Friends have importun'd me to say something of the Expression and the Harmony which I shall do my utmost Endeavour to decline  I am SIR Your  c  Jan  To the Right Honourable the Earl of HALIFAX  My LORD  WHEN I heard of the new Honours with which the King had distinguish'd your Merit and acknowledg'd your Services there was not one of your Lordship's humble Servants who receiv'd the happy Tidings with more Joy than my self If any thing temper'd that Joy it was the Concern that I was not able to wait on your Lordship to congratulate you so soon as the rest  If ever I can be able to do important Service to my Country which has been all along the darling Passion of my Life it must be under your Lordship's Administration▪ For I never yet could attend upon any Mi+nister of State with Inclination and Plea+sure but your self If your Lordship wil  grant me the Honour from time to time▪  to let me write my Thoughts freely to you I shall endeavour to manage that Privilege with so much Discretion that your Lordship shall not repent of it and I shall not be utterly in Despair of doing some Service to the Publick  I am My  LORD  Your Lordship's most Oblig'd and most Humble Faithful Servant  Oct  LETTERS ON THE Genius and Writings OF SHAKESPEAR  To the Right Honourable GEORGE GRANVILLE  Esq  Secretary at WAR  SIR  AN Address of this nature made upon your Advancement to one of the principal Employments of the State and made by one who has had the Honour to be known to you so many Years might be pretended by malicious People to be a Homage rather to your Fortune and Power than a due Respect to your Merit and Virtue if it were not publickly known that I formerly applied my self to you in the same manner when you were much more distinguished by Merit and Virtue than by Fortune and Power  But if any one farther maliciously urges that even when I formerly applied my self to you by the distinguishing Qualities of your Mind and Person I foresaw your Fortune and Power to him I answer in order to vindicate the Reputation of my Sincerity and my Disinterestedness that tho' I saw  very well that those great Qualities fitted Mr  Granville  for the most illustrious Employments yet who could have ever imagin'd that any Man living had Merit enough to raise him in spight of so many unfortunate Virtues with which that Merit was attended in spight of not only a true Poetical Genius but a Frankness a Probity a matchless Integrity a Sincerity worthy of Heroick Times and a most untainted Honour  But tho' your Character were less conspicuous and what I had formerly done were intirely forgot the numerous and powerful Obligations I have to you would more than justify this Address and the omitting the first Opportunity of making you a publick Acknowledgment would look like black Ingratitude You have taken such Care of my Interest with others at a most seasonable Conjuncture and have your self made me a Present so noble and so extraordinary at a time when I stood most in need of it that how few alive have Spirit and Magnanimity to do any thing like it At least I defy any one to name that living Man who in a private Capacity has done any thing like it  I know very well indeed that you are very far from desiring such a publick Acknowledgment that you aim at nothing by doing daily good but the Godlike Pleasure which results from your Actions and that others  perhaps may censure me for sacrificing your Modesty to my own Vanity For to publish to the World that I have been oblig'd in an extraordinary manner by a Person so universally esteem'd and distinguish'd that one of the very few Things in which the most violent of both Parties agree is the Character of Mr  Granville  will be thought to be the Result of uncommon Vanity by those who have not Goodness enough to believe it to be the Effect of a lively Gratitude  But tho' Sir I had no Obligation to you and you had no other Merit but that of perfectly understanding an Art which you have perfectly practis'd  viz  the Art which is the Subject of the following Treatise that Treatise would be by Right of Nature yours For to whom can an Essay upon the Genius and Writings of  Shakespear  be so properly address'd as to him who best understands  Shakespear  and who has most improv'd him I would not give this just Encomium to the  Jew of Venice  if I were not convinc'd from a long Experience of the Penetration and Force of your Judgment that no Exaltation can make you asham'd of your former noble Art that you know it to be a Weakness barely to imagine that the most noble and most exalted of all Arts and the most difficult to excel in can render a Man less qualified for publick Business or  for the first Employments of the State that all the great Statesmen who have best succeeded in Affairs of Government have either writ Poems or Treatises concerning Poetry The most ancient of Historians and Legislators  Moses  at least of those whose Laws and Histories remain has given us a pathetick and a lofty Poem upon the Passage of the  Red Sea  The  Athenian  Legislator  Solon  thought it not in the least below his Dignity to render Moral Virtue lovely by the  of Verse And  Lacedemonian Lycurgus  the rigid and the austere  Lycurgus  thought it an Employment worthy of his Wisdom ana Virtue to restore and publish the immortal Works of  Homer  Having the same Opinion of that Prince of Poets that  Horace  afterwards had that his Poems would better instruct Mankind in Virtue than they could be possibly taught by Prose The most illustrious Writers of Politicks among the  Grecians Plato  and  Aristotle  one of them had a figurative a lofty and a Poetick Prose and the other who may be call'd the Legislator of  Parnassus  wrote the Laws of Tragedy so exactly and so truly in Reason and Nature that succeeding Criticks have writ justly and reasonably upon that Art no farther than they have adhered to their great Master's Notions  Tacitus  the very Oracle of  Modern Statesmen has a Stile that is warm and daring and figurative that is to say Poetick  Machiavel  the Prince of Modern Politicians if we except but one of our own Countrymen wrote more than one Comedy and more than one Poem has been attempted by our  British  Politician  Harrington  The two Princes of Poets may easily be proved to've been great Statesmen  Homer  particularly made choice of a Moral which in his Time when  Greece  with the Islands of the  Aegaean  was divided into petty Sovereignties was the fundamental Maxim of their Politicks and their true Interest which Moral was as  Sallust  afterwards express'd it  Concordiâ res parvae crescunt Discordiâ maxima dilabuntur  from whose noblest Poem you formerly gave us a Tragedy in which in Imitation of  Homer  you are daring yet just fiery yet regular sublime yet natural and perspicuous chast yet alluring and easie yet strong and powerful  But to come to the more active Part of Government the greatest Monarchs and Captains and Ministers of State that ever were known in the World either were or would have been great Poets When  Athens  flourish'd in all her Glory their Poets and their famous Writers were they who directed their Counsels and led their Armies  to Battel  Alexander  read nothing but the Works of  Homer  while he conquer'd the Orient In  Rome  the greatest Captain that flourish'd in the Time of the Commonwealth vouchsafed his Assistance to a Comick Poet And the two first  Caesars  were proud to write Tragedies with those fatal Hands that were victorious over the Universe  Mecaenas  at the Time that he was first Minister to the Emperor of the World was not only the greatest Patron of the Muses that ever was but endeavour'd to be himself a Poet If we descend to Mordern Times  Richlieu  who laid the Foundation of the  French  Greatness wrote more than one Dramatick Poem with that very right Hand which dictated to the Cabinets of so many Sovereign Princes and directed the successful Motions of so many conquering Commanders And that Greatness which upon a  French  Poetick Foundation was in the Space of less than one Century rais'd to an insupportable Height was in less than twenty Years sapp'd and undermin'd and overturn'd by a  British  Poetick Ministry It being undeniable that several of the Persons who made the chief Figures in both the old and the new Ministry were Poets I make no doubt Sir but the time will come when you will be distinguish'd by the  Wisdom and Reach of your Counsels as much as you were formerly by the Spirit and Justness of your Writings For the very Virtues which we once were afraid would hinder your Advancement even in the most virtuous Court are now like to preserve and support your Interest since you have had an Opportunity of publickly practising them so long 'Tis impossible to behold that Ardor that Sincerity and that Alacrity with which you every Day endeavour to do good to your FellowCreatures without loving you and without wishing as well as hoping that you may be the peculiar Care of Providence which by advancing you to one of the most eminent Stations would provide for Thousands But when we behold that Ardor and that Alacrity attended with such an attractive Sweetness and such a manly Grace and with a Nobility which God and Nature seem to have imprinted both on your Mind and Person we have no longer Power over our selves but give up all our Affections to you and not only wish but firmly believe that since God and Nature have given you those several Excellencies which were the undoubted Original of all Political Nobility they have determin'd you to succeed to the most extensive Fortunes and Titles of your Noble Ancestors  which is warmly desir'd and earnestly expected by all who have the Honour to know you but more especially by  SIR Your most Oblig'd most Humble and most Faithful Servant JOHN DENNIS  On the Genius and Writings of SHAKESPEAR  To Mr  LETTER I  Feb  SIR  I Here send you the Tragedy of  Coriolanus  which I have alter'd from the Original of  Shakespear  and with it a short Account of the Genius and Writings of that Author both which you desired me to send to you the last time I had the good Fortune to see you But I send them both upon this condition that you will with your usual Sincerity tell me your Sentiments both of the Poem and of the Criticism  Shakespear  was one of the greatest Genius's that the World e'er saw for the Tragick Stage Tho' he lay under greater Disadvantages than any of his Successors yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than the best and greatest of them And what makes the brightest Glory of his Character  those Beauties were entirely his own and owing to the Force of his own Nature whereas his Faults were owing to his Education and to the Age that he liv'd in One may say of him as they did of  Homer  that he had none to imitate and is himself inimitable His Imaginations were often as just as they were bold and strong He had a natural Discretion which never cou'd have been taught him and his Judgment was strong and penetrating He seems to have wanted nothing but Time and Leisure for Thought to have found out those Rules of which he appears so ignorant His Characters are always drawn justly exactly graphically except where he fail'd by not knowing History or the Poetical Art He has for the most part more fairly distinguish'd them than any of his Successors have done who have falsified them or confounded them by making Love the predominant Quality in all He had so fine a Talent for touching the Passions and they are so lively in him and so truly in Nature that they often touch us more without their due Preparations than those of other Tragick Poets who have all the Beauty of Design and all the Advantage of Incidents Hi  MasterPassion was Terror which he ha  often mov'd so powerfully and so wonderfully that we may justly conclude that i  he had had the Advantage of Art and Learn+ing  he wou'd have surpass'd the very best and strongest of the Ancients His Paintings are often so beautiful and so lively so graceful and so powerful especially where he uses them in order to move Terror that there is nothing perhaps more accomplish'd in our  English  Poetry His Sentiments for the most part in his best Tragedies are noble generous easie and natural and adapted to the Persons who use them His Expression is in many Places good and pure after a hundred Years simple tho' elevated graceful tho' bold and easie tho' strong He seems to have been the very Original of our  English  Tragical Harmony that is the Harmony of Blank Verse diversifyed often by Dissyllable and Trissyllable Terminations For that Diversity distinguishes it from Heroick Harmony and bringing it nearer to common Use makes it more proper to gain Attention and more fit for Action and Dialogue Such Verse we make when we are writing Prose we make such Verse in common Conversation  If  Shakespear  had these great Qualities by Nature what would he not have been if he had join'd to so happy a Genius Learning and the Poetical Art For want of the latter our Author has sometimes made gross Mistakes in the Characters which he has drawn from History against the Equality  and Conveniency of Manners of his Dramatical Persons Witness  Menenius  in the following Tragedy whom he has made an errant Buffoon which is a great Absurdity For he might as well have imagin'd a grave majestick  JackPudding  as a Buffoon in a  Roman  Senator  Aufidius  the General of the  Volscians  is shewn a base and a profligate Villain He has offended against the Equality of the Manners even in his Hero himself For  Coriolanus  who in the first part of the Tragedy is shewn so open so frank so violent and so magnanimous is represented in the latter part by  Aufidius  which is contradicted by no one a flattering fawning cringing insinuating Traytor  For want of this Poetical Art  Shakespear  has introduced things into his Tragedies which are against the Dignity of that noble Poem as the Rabble in  Julius Caesar  and that in  Coriolanus  tho' that in  Coriolanus  offends not only against the Dignity of Tragedy but against the Truth of History likewise and the Customs of Ancient  Rome  and the Majesty of the  Roman  People as we shall have occasion to shew anon  For want of this Art he has made his Incidents less moving less surprizing and less wonderful He has been so far from seeking those fine Occasions to move with which an Action furnish'd according to Art would have furnish'd him that he  seems rather to have industriously avoided them He makes  Coriolanus  upon his Sentence of Banishment take his leave of his Wife and his Mother out of sight of the Audience and so has purposely as it were avoided a great occasion to move  If we are willing to allow that  Shakespear  by sticking to the bare Events of History has mov'd more than any of his Successors yet his just Admirers must confess that if he had had the Poetical Art he would have mov'd ten times more For 'tis impossible that by a bare Historical Play he could move so much as he would have done by a Fable  We find that a Romance entertains the generality of Mankind with more Satisfaction than History if they read only to be entertain'd but if they read History thro' Pride or Ambition they bring their Passions along with them and that alters the case Nothing is more plain than that even in an Historical Relation some Parts of it and some Events please more than others And therefore a Man of Judgment who sees why they do so may in forming a Fable and disposing an Action please more than an Historian can do For the just Fiction of a Fable moves us more than an Historical Relation can do for the two following Reasons First by reason of the Communication and mutual Dependence  of its Parts For if Passion springs from Motion then the Obstruction of that Motion or a counter Motion must obstruct and check the Passion And therefore an Historian and a Writer of Historical Plays passing from Events of one nature to Events of another nature without a due Preparation must of necessity stifle and confound one Passion by another The second Reason why the Fiction of a Fable pleases us more than an Historical Relation can do is because in an Historical Relation we seldom are acquainted with the true Causes of Events whereas in a feign'd Action which is duly constituted that is which has a just beginning those Causes always appear For 'tis observable that both in a Poetical Fiction and an Historical Relation those Events are the most entertaining the most surprizing and the most wonderful in which Providence most plainly appears And 'tis for this Reason that the Author of a just Fable must please more than the Writer of an Historical Relation The Good must never fail to prosper and the Bad must be always punish'd Otherwise the Incidents and particularly the Catastrophe which is the grand Incident are liable to be imputed rather to Chance than to Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Justice The want of this impartial Distribution of Justice makes the  Coriolanus  of  Shakespear  to be without Moral 'Tis true indeed  Coriolanus  is kill'd by those Foreign Enemies with whom he had openly sided against his Country which seems to be an Event worthy of Providence and would look as if it were contriv'd by infinite Wisdom and executed by supreme Justice to make  Coriolanus  a dreadful Example to all who lead on Foreign Enemies to the Invasion of their native Country if there were not something in the Fate of the other Characters which gives occasion to doubt of it and which suggests to the Sceptical Reader that this might happen by accident For  Ausidius  the principal Murderer of  Coriolanus  who in cold Blood gets him assassinated by Ruffians instead of leaving him to the Law of the Country and the Justice of the  Volscian  Senate and who commits so black a Crime not by any erroneous Zeal or a mistaken publick Spirit but thro' Jealousy Envy and inveterate Malice this Assassinator not only survives and survives unpunish'd but seems to be rewarded for so detestable an Action by engrossing all those Honours to himself which  Coriolanus  before had shar'd with him But not only  Ausidius  but the  Roman  Tribunes  Sicinius  and  Brutus  appear to me to cry aloud for Poetick Vengeance For they are guilty of two Faults neither of which ought to go unpunish'd The first in procuring the Banishment  of  Coriolanus  If they were really jealous that  Coriolanus  had a Design on their Liberties when he stood for the Consulship it was but just that they should give him a Repulse but to get the Champion and Defender of their Country banish'd upon a pretended Jealousy was a great deal too much and could proceed from nothing but that Hatred and Malice which they had conceiv'd against him for opposing their Institution Their second Fault lay in procuring this Sentence by indirect Methods by exasperating and inflaming the People by Artifices and Insinuations by taking a base Advantage of the Openheartedness and Violence of  Coriolanus  and by oppressing him with a Sophistical Argument that he aim'd at Sovereignty because he had not delivered into the Publick Treasury the Spoils which he had taken from the  Antiates  As if a Design of Sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one Act or any one could think of bringing to pass such a Design by eternally favouring the Patricians and disobliging the Populace For we need make no doubt but that it was among the young Patricians that  Coriolanus  distributed the Spoils which were taken from the  Antiates  whereas nothing but caressing the Populace could enslave the  Roman  People as  Caesar  afterwards very well saw and experienc'd So that this Injustice of the Tribunes was the  original Cause of the Calamity which afterwards befel their Country by the Invasion of the  Volscians  under the Conduct of  Coriolanus  And yet these Tribunes at the end of the Play like  Aufidius  remain unpunish'd But indeed  Shakespear  has been wanting in the exact Distribution of Poetical Justice not only in his  Coriolanus  but in most of his best Tragedies in which the Guilty and the Innocent perish promiscuously as  Duncan  and  Banquo  in  Mackbeth  as likewise Lady  Macduffe  and her Children  Desdemona  in  Othello Cordelia Kent  and King  Lear  in the Tragedy that bears his Name  Brutus  and  Porcia  in  Julius Caesar  and young  Hamlet  in the Tragedy of  Hamlet  For tho' it may said in Defence of the last that  Hamlet  had a Design to kill his Uncle who then reign'd yet this is justify'd by no less than a Call from Heaven and raising up one from the Dead to urge him to it The Good and the Bad then perishing promiscuously in the best of  Shakespear  's Tragedies there can be either none or very weak Instruction in them For such promiscuous Events call the Government of Providence into Question and by Scepticks and Libertines are resolv'd into Chance I humbly conceive therefore that this want of Dramatical Justice in the Tragedy of  Coriolanus  gave occasion for a just Alteration and that I was oblig'd to sacrifice to that Justice  Aufidius  and the Tribunes as well as  Coriolanus  Thus have we endeavour'd to shew that for want of the Poetical Art  Shakespear  lay under very great Disadvantages At the same time we must own to his Honour that he has often perform'd Wonders without it in spight of the Judgment of so great a Man as  Horace  Naturâ fieret laudabile carmen an arte  Quaesitum est ego nec studium sinè divite venâ  Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium alterius sic  Altera poscit opem res conjurat amicé  But from this very udgment of  Horace  we may justly conclude that  Shakespear  would have wonderfully surpass'd himself if Art had been join'd to Nature There never was a greater Genius in the World than  Virgil  He was one who seems to have been born for this glorious End that the  Roman  Muse might exert in him the utmost Force of her Poetry And his admirable and divine Beauties are manifestly owing to the happy Confederacy of Art and Nature It was Art that contriv'd that incomparable Design of the  Aeneis  and it was Nature that executed it Could the greatest Genius that ever was infus'd into Earthly Mold by Heaven if it had been unguided and unassisted by Art  have taught him to make that noble and wonderful Use of the  Pythagorean  Transmigration which he makes in the Sixth Book of his Poem Had  Virgil  been a circular Poet and closely adher'd to History how could the  Romans  have been transported with that inimitable Episode of  Dido  which brought afresh into their Minds the  Carthaginian  War and the dreadful  Hannibal  When 'tis evident that that admirable Episode is so little owing to a faithful observance of History and the exact order of Time that 'tis deriv'd from a very bold but judicious Violation of these it being undeniable that  Dido  liv'd almost Years after  Aeneas  Yet is it that charming Episode that makes the chief Beauties of a third Part of the Poem For the Destruction of  Troy  it self which is so divinely related is still more admirable by the Effect it produces which is the Passion of  Dido  I should now proceed to shew under what Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of being conversant with the Ancients But I have already writ a long Letter and am desirous to know how you relish what has been already said before I go any farther For I am unwilling to take more Pains before I am sure of giving you some Pleasure I am  SIR Your most humble faithful Servant  On the Genius and Writings of SHAKESPEAR  LETTER II  Feb  SIR  UPON the Encouragement I have receiv'd from you I shall proceed to shew under what Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of being conversant with the Ancients But because I have lately been in some Conversation where they would not allow but that he was acquainted with the Ancients I shall endeavour to make it appear that he was not and the shewing that in the Method in which I pretend to convince the Reader of it will sufficiently prove what Inconveniencies he lay under and what Errors he committed for want of being conversant with them But here we must distinguish between the several kinds of Acquaintance A Man may be said to be acquainted with another who never was but twice in his Company but that is at the best a superficial Acquaintance  from which neither very great Pleasure nor Profit can be deriv'd Our Business is here to shew that  Shakespear  had no familiar Acquaintance with the  Graecian  and  Roman  Authors For if he was familiarly conversant with them how comes it to pass that he wants Art Is it that he studied to know them in other things and neglected that only in them which chiefly tends to the Advancement of the Art of the Stage Or is it that he wanted Discernment to see the Justness and the Greatness and the Harmony of their Designs and the Reasonableness of those Rules upon which those Designs are founded Or how come his Successors to have that Discernment which he wanted when they fall so much below him in other things How comes he to have been guilty of the grossest Faults in Chronology and how come we to find out those Faults In his Tragedy of  Troylus  and  Cressida  he introduces  Hector  speaking of  Aristotle  who was born a thousand Years after the Death of  Hector  In the same Play mention is made of  Milo  which is another very great Fault in Chronology  Alexander  is mention'd in  Coriolanus  tho' that Conqueror of the Orient liv'd above two hundred Years after him In this last Tragedy he has mitaken the very Names of his Dramatick Persons if we give Credit to  Livy  For the Mother of  Coriolanus  in the  Roman  Historian  is  Vetturia  and the Wife is  Volumnia  Whereas in  Shakespear  the Wife is  Virgilia  and the Mother  Volumnia  And the  Volscian  General in  Shakespear  is  Tullus Aufidius  and  Tullus Attius  in  Livy  How comes it that he takes  Plutarch  's Word who was by Birth a  Graecian  for the Affairs of  Rome  rather than that of the  Roman  Historian if so be that he had read the latter Or what Reason can be given for his not reading him when he wrote upon a  Roman  Story but that in  Shakespear  's time there was a Translation of  Plutarch  and there was none of  Livy  If  Shakespear  was familiarly conversant with the  Roman  Authors how came he to introduce a Rabble into  Coriolanus  in which he offended not only against the Dignity of Tragedy but the Truth of Fact the Authority of all the  Roman  Writers the Customs of Ancient  Rome  and the Majesty of the  Roman  People By introducing a Rabble into  Julius Caesar  he only offended against the Dignity of Tragedy For that part of the People who ran about the Streets upon great Festivals or publick Calamities or publick Rejoicings or Revolutions in Govern+ment are certainly the Scum of the Populace But the Persons who in the Time of  Coriolanus  rose in Vindication of their just Rights and extorted from the Patrician  the Institution of the Tribunes of the Peo+ple  and the Persons by whom afterwards  Coriolanus  was tried were the whole Body of the  Roman  People to the Reserve of the Patricians which Body included the  Roman  Knights and the wealthy substantial Citizens who were as different from the Rabble as the Patricians themselves as qualify'd as the latter to form a right Judgment of Things and to contemn the vain Opinions of the Rabble So at least  Horace  esteems them who very well knew his Countrymen  Offenduntur enim quibus est equus aut pater aut res  Nec siquid fricti ciceris probat aut nucis emptor  Aequis accipiant animis donantve Corona  Where we see the Knights and the substantial Citizens are rank'd in an equal Degree of Capacity with the  Roman  Senators and are equally distinguish'd from the Rabble  If  Shakespear  was so conversant with the Ancients how comes he to have introduc'd some Characters into his Plays so unlike what they are to be found in History In the Character of  Menenius  in the following Tragedy he has doubly offended against  hat Historical Resemblance For first where  s  Menenius  was an eloquent Person  Shakespear  has made him a downright Buffoon  And how is it possible for any Man to conceive a  Ciceronian Jackpudding  Never was any Buffoon eloquent or wise or witty or virtuous All the good and ill Qualities of a Buffoon are summ'd up in one Word and that is a Buffoon And secondly whereas  Shakespear  has made him a Hater and Contemner and Villifier of the People we are assur'd by the  Roman  Historian that  Menenius  was extremely popular He was so very far from opposing the Institution of the Tribunes as he is represented in  Shakespear  that he was chiefly instrumental in it After the People had deserted the City and sat down upon the sacred Mountain he was the chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to them as being look'd upon to be the Person who would be most agreeable to them In short this very  Menenius  both liv'd and dy'd so very much their Favourite that dying poor he had pompous Funerals at the Expence of the  Roman  People  Had  Shakespear  read either  Sallust  or  Cicero  how could he have made so very little of the first and greatest of Men as that  Caesar  should be but a Fourthrate Actor in his own Tragedy How could it have been that seeing  Caesar  we should ask for  Caesar  That we should ask where is his unequall'd Greatness of Mind his unbounded Thirst of Glory and that victorious Eloquence  with which he triumph'd over the Souls of both Friends and Enemies and with which he rivall'd  Cicero  in Genius as he did  Pompey  in Power How fair an Occasion was there to open the Character of  Caesar  in the first Scene between  Brutus  and  Cassius  For when  Cassius  tells  Brutus  that  Caesar  was but a Man like them and had the same natural Imperfections which they had how natural had it been for  Brutus  to reply that  Caesar  indeed had their Imperfections of Nature but neither he nor  Cassius  had by any means the great Qualities of  Caesar  neither his Military Virtue nor Science nor his matchless Renown nor his unparallell'd Victories his unwearied Bounty to his Friends nor his Godlike Clemency to his Foes his Beneficence his Munificence his Easiness of Access to the meanest  Roman  his indefatigable Labours his incredible Celerity the Plausibleness if not Justness of his Ambition that knowing himself to be the greatest of Men he only sought occasion to make the World confess him such In short if  Brutus  after enumerating all the wonderful Qualities of  Caesar  had resolv'd in spight of them all to sacrifice him to publick Liberty how had such a Proceeding heighten'd the Virtue and the Character of  Brutus  But then indeed it would have been requisite that  Caesar  upon his Appearance should have made all this good And as we know no Principle of human Action but human Sentiment only  Caesar  who did greater Things and had greater Designs than the rest of the  Romans  ought certainly to have outshin'd by many Degrees all the other Characters of his Tragedy  Caesar  ought particularly to have justified his Actions and to have heighten'd his Character by shewing that what he had done he had done by Necessity that the  Romans  had lost their  Agrarian  lost their Rotation of Magistracy and that consequently nothing but an empty Shadow of publick Liberty remain'd That the  Gracchi  had made the last noble but unsuccessful Efforts for the restoring the Commonwealth that they had fail'd for want of arbitrary irresistible Power the Restoration of the  Agrarian  requiring too vast a Retrospect to be done without it that the Government when  Caesar  came to publick Af+fairs was got into the Hands of a few and that those few were factious and were contending among themselves and if you will pardon so mean an Expression scrambling as it were for Power That  Caesar  was reduc'd to the Necessity of ruling or himself obeying a Master and that apprehending that another would exercise the supreme Command without that Clemency and Mo+deration which he did he had rather cho+sen  to rule than to obey So that  Caesar  was faulty not so much in seizing upon the Sovereignty which was become in a manner necessary as in not reestablishing the Commonwealth by restoring the  Agrarian  and the Rotation of Magistracies after he had got absolute and uncontroulable Power And if  Caesar  had seiz'd upon the Sovereignty only with a View of reestablishing Liberty he had surpass'd all Mortals in Godlike Goodness as much as he did in the rest of his astonishing Qualities I must confess I do not remember that we have any Authority from the  Roman  Historians which may induce us to believe that  Caesar  had any such Design Nor if he had had any such View could he who was the most secret the most prudent and the most discerning of Men have discover'd it before his  Parthian  Expedition was over for fear of utterly disobliging his Veterans And  Caesar  believ'd that Expedition necessary for the Honour and Interest of the State and for his own Glory  But of this we may be sure that two of the most discerning of all the  Romans  and who had the deepest Insight into the Soul of  Caesar Sallust  and  Cicero  were not without Hopes that  Caesar  would really reestablish Liberty or else they would not have attack'd him upon it the one in his Oration  for  Marcus Marcellus  the other in the Second Part of that little Treatise  De Republicâ ordinandâ  which is address'd to  Caesar Haec igitur tibi reliqua pars  says  Cicero Hic restat Actus in hoc elaborandum est ut Rempublicam constituas eâque tu in primis compositâ summa Tranquillitate otio perfruare Cicero  therefore was not without Hope that  Caesar  would reestablish the Commonwealth and any one who attentively peruses that Oration of  Cicero  will find that that Hope was reasonably grounded upon his knowledge of the great Qualities of  Caesar  his Clemency his Beneficence his admirable Discernment and that avoidless Ruine in which the whole Empire would be soon involv'd if  Caesar  did not effect this  Sallust  urges it still more home to him and with greater vehemence he has recourse to every Motive that may be thought to be powerful over so great a Soul He exhorts him by the Memory of his matchless Conquests not to suffer the invincible Empire of the  Roman  People to be devour'd by Time or to be torn in pieces by Discord one of which would soon and infallibly happen if Liberty was not restor'd  He introduces his Country and his Progenitors urging him in a noble Prosopopeia by all the mighty Benefits which they had conferr'd upon him with so little Pains of  his own not to deny them that just and easy Request of the Restoration of Liberty He adjures him by those Furies which will eternally haunt his Soul upon his impious Refusal He implores him by the foresight of those dismal Calamities that horrible Slaughter those endless Wars and that unbounded Devastation which will certainly fall upon Mankind if the Restoration of Liberty is prevented by his Death or his incurable Sickness And lastly he entreats him by his Thirst of immortal Glory that Glory in which he now has Rivals if he has not Equals but which if he reestablishes Liberty will be acknowledg'd by consenting Nations to have neither Equal nor Second  I am apt to believe that if  Shakespear  had been acquainted with all this we had had from him quite another Character of  Caesar  than that which we now find in him He might then have given us a Scene something like that which  Corneille  has so happily us'd in his  Cinna  something like that which really happen'd between  Augustus Mecaenas  and  Agrippa  He might then have introduc'd  Caesar  consulting  Cicero  on the one side and on the other  Anthony  whether he should retain that absolute Sovereignty which he had acquir'd by his Victory or whether he should reestablish and immortaize Liberty That would have been a  Scene which might have employ'd the finest Art and the utmost force of a Writer That had been a Scene in which all the great Qualities of  Caesar  might have been display'd I will not pretend to determine here how that Scene might have been turn'd and what I have already said on this Subject has been spoke with the utmost Caution and Diffidence But this I will venture to say that if that Scene had been manag'd so as by the powerful Motives employ'd in it to have shaken the Soul of  Caesar  and to have left room for the least Hope for the least Doubt that  Caesar  would have reestablish'd Liberty after his  Parthian  Expedition and if this Conversation had been kept secret till the Death of  Caesar  and then had been discover'd by  Anthony  then had  Caesar  fall'n so belov'd and lamented by the  Roman  People so pitied and so bewail'd even by the Conspirator  themselves as never Man fell Then ther  would have been a Catastrophe the mo  dreadful and the most deplorable that eve  was beheld upon the Tragick Stage The  had we seen the noblest of the Conspirator  cursing their temerarious Act and the mo  apprehensive of them in dreadful expectatio  of those horrible Calamities which fell upon the  Romans  after the Death of  Caesar  But Sir when I write this to you I write  with the utmost Deference to the extraordi+nary  Judgment of that great Man who some Years ago I hear alter'd the  Julius Caesar  And I make no doubt but that his fine Discernment and the rest of his great Qualities have amply supply'd the Defects which are found in the Character of  Shakespear  's  Caesar  I should here answer an Argument by which some People pretend to prove and especially those with whom I lately convers'd that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients But besides that the Post is about to be gone I am heartily tir'd with what I have already writ and so doubtless are you I shall therefore defer the rest to the next opportunity and remain  Your  c  On the Writings and Genius of SHAKESPEAR  LETTER III  Feb  SIR  I Come now to the main Argument which some People urge to prove that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients For there is say they among  Shakespear  's Plays one call'd  The Comedy of Errors  which is undeniably an Imitation of the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  Now  Shakespear  say they being conversant with  Plautus  it undeniably follows that he was acquainted with the Ancients because no  Roman  Author could be hard to him who had conquer'd  Plautus  To which I answer that the Errors which we have mention'd above are to be accounted for no other way but by the want of knowing the Ancients or by downright want of Capacity But nothing can be more absurd or more unjust than to impute it to want of Capacity For the very Sentiments of  Shakespear  alone  are sufficient to shew that he had a great Understanding And therefore we must account some other way for his Imitation of the  Menechmi  I remember to have seen among the Translations of  Ovid  's Epistles printed by Mr  Tonson  an Imitation of that from  OEnone  to  Paris  which Mr  Dryden  tells us in his Preface to those Epistles was imitated by one of the Fair Sex who understood no  Latin  but that she had done enough to make those blush who understood it the best There are at this day several Translators who as  Hudibrass  has it  Translate from Languages of which  They understand no part of Speech  I will not affirm that of  Shakespear  I believe he was able to do what Pedants call construe but that he was able to read  Plautus  without Pain and Difficulty I can never believe Now I appeal to you Sir what time he had between his Writing and his Acting to read any thing that could not be read with Ease and Pleasure We see that our Adversaries themselves acknowledge that if  Shakespear  was able to read  Plautus  with Ease nothing in Latinity could be hard to him How comes it to pass then that he has given us no Proofs of his familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients  but this Imitation of the  Menechmi  and a Version of two Epistles of  Ovid  How comes it that he had never read  Horace  of a superiour Merit to either and particularly his Epistle to the  Piso's  which so much concern'd his Art Or if he had read that Epistle how comes it that in his  Troylus  and  Cressida  we must observe by the way that when  Shakespear  wrote that Play  Ben Johnson  had not as yet translated that Epistle he runs counter to the Instructions which  Horace  has given for the forming the Character of  Achilles  Scriptor Honoratum si forte reponis Achillem  Impiger Iracundus Inexorablis Acer  Jura neget sibi nata  Where is the  Impiger  the  Iracundus  or the  Acer  in the Character of  Shakespear  's  Achilles  who is nothing but a drolling lazy conceited overlooking Coxcomb so far from being the honour'd  Achilles  the Epithet that  Homer  and  Horace  after him give him that he is deservedly the Scorn and the Jest of the rest of the Characters even to that Buffoon  Thersites  Tho'  Shakespear  succeeded very well in Comedy yet his principal Talent and his chief Delight was Tragedy If then  Shakespear  was qualify'd to read  Plautus  with  Ease he could read with a great deal more Ease the Translations of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  And tho' by these Translations he would not have been able to have seen the charming colouring of those great Masters yet would he have seen all the Harmony and the Beauty of their great and their just Designs He would have seen enough to have stirr'd up a noble Emulation in so exalted a Soul as his How comes it then that we hear nothing from him of the  O Edipus  the  Electra  the  Antigone  of  Sophocles  of the  Iphigenia's  the  Orestes  the  Medea  the  Hecuba  of  Euripides  How comes it that we see nothing in the Conduct of his Pieces that shews us that he had the least Acquaintance with any of these great Masterpieces Did  Shakespear  appear to be so nearly touch'd with the Affliction of  Hecuba  for the Death of  Priam  which was but daub'd and bungled by one of his Countrymen that he could not forbear introducing it as it were by Violence into his own  Hamlet  and would he make no Imitation no Commendation not the least Mention of the unparallell'd and inimitable Grief of the  Hecuba  of  Euripides  How comes it that we find no Imitation of any ancient Play in Him but the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  How came he to chuse a Comick preferably to the Tragick Poets Or how comes he to chuse  Plutus  preferably to  Terence  who is so much more just more graceful more regular and more natural Or how comes he to chuse the  Menechmi  of  Plautus  which is by no means his Masterpiece before all his other Comedies I vehemently suspect that this Imitation of the  Menechmi  was either from a printed Translation of that Comedy which is lost or some Version in Manuscript brought him by a Friend or sent him perhaps by a Stranger or from the original Play it self recommended to him and read to him by some learned Friend In short I had rather account for this by what is not absurd than by what is or by a less Absurdity than by a greater For nothing can be more wrong than to conclude from this that  Shakespear  was conversant with the Ancients which contradicts the Testimony of his Contemporary and his familiar Acquaintance  Ben Johnson  and of his Successor  Milton  Lo  Shakespear  Fancy's sweetest Child  Warbles his native Woodnotes wild  and of Mr  Dryden  after them both and which destroys the most glorious Part of  Shakespear  's Merit immediately For how can he be esteem'd equal by Nature or superior to the Ancients when he falls so far short of them in Art tho' he had the Advantage  of knowing all that they did before him Nay it debases him below those of common Capacity by reason of the Errors which we mention'd above Therefore he who allows that  Shakespear  had Learning and a familiar Acquaintance with the Ancients ought to be look'd upon as a Detractor from his extraordinary Merit and from the Glory of  Great Britain  For whether is it more honourable for this Island to have produc'd a Man who without having any Acquaintance with the Ancients or any but a slender and a superficial one appears to be their Equal or their Superiour by the Force of Genius and Nature or to have bred one who knowing the Ancients falls infinitely short of them in Art and consequently in Nature it self  Great Britain  has but little Reason to boast of its Natives Education since the same that they had here they might have had in another place But it may justly claim a very great share in their Nature and Genius since these depend in a great measure on the Climate and therefore  Horace  in the Instruction which he gives for the forming the Characters advises the noble  Romans  for whose Instruction he chiefly writes to consider whether the Dramatick Person whom they introduce is  Colchus an Assyrius Thebis nutritus an Argis  Thus Sir I have endeavour'd to shew under what great Disadvantages  Shakespear  lay for want of the Poetical Art and for want of being conversant with the Ancients  But besides this he lay under other very great Inconveniencies For he was neither Master of Time enough to consider correct and polish what he wrote to alter it to add to it and to retrench from it nor had he Friends to consult upon whose Capacity and Integrity he could depend And tho' a Person of very good Judgment may succeed very well without consulting his Friends if he takes time enough to correct what he writes yet even the greatest Man that Nature and Art can conspire to accomplish can never attain to Perfection without either employing a great deal of time or taking the Advice of judicious Friends Nay 'tis the Opinion of  Horace  that he ought to do both  Siquid tamen olim  Scripseris in Metii descendat Judicis aures  Et Patris nostras nonumque prematur in Annum  Now we know very well that  Shakespear  was an Actor at a time when there were seven or eight Companies of Players in the Town together who each of them did their utmost Endeavours to get the Audiences from the rest and consequently that our Author was perpetually call'd upon by those who had the Direction and Management of the Company to which he belong'd for new Pieces which might be able to support them and give them some Advantage over the rest And 'tis easie to judge what Time he was Master of between his laborious Employment of Acting and his continual Hurry of Writing As for Friends they whom in all likelihood  Shakespear  consulted most were two or three of his FellowActors because they had the Care of publishing his Works committed to them Now they as we are told by  Ben Johnson  in his  Discoveries  were extremely pleas'd with their Friend for scarce ever making a Blot and were very angry with  Ben  for saying he wish'd that he had made a thousand The Misfortune of it is that  Horace  was perfectly of  Ben  's mind  Vos O  Pompilius sanguis carmen reprehendite quod non  Multa dies multa litura coercuit atque  Praesectum decies non castigavit ad unguem  And so was my Lord  Roscommon  Poet lose half the Praise they should have got  Could it be known what they discreetly blot  These Friends then of  Shakespear  were not qualify'd to advise him As for  Ben Johnson  besides that  Shakespear  began to know him late and that  Ben  was not the most communicative Person in the World of the Secrets of his Art he seems to me to have had no right Notion of Tragedy Nay so far from it that he who was indeed a very great Man and who has writ Comedies by which he has born away the Prize of Comedy both from Ancients and Moderns and been an Honour to  Great Britain  and who has done this without any Rules to guide him except what his own incomparable Talent dictated to him This extraordinary Man has err'd so grossly in Tragedy of which there were not only stated Rules but Rules which he himself had often read and had even translated that he has chosen two Subjects which according to those very Rules were utterly incapable of exciting either Compassion or Terror for the principal Characters which yet are the chief Passions that a Tragick Poet ought to endeavour to excite So that  Shakespear  having neither had Time to correct nor  Friends to consult must necessarily have frequently left such faults in his Writings for the Correction of which either a great deal of Time or a judicious and a wellnatur'd Friend is indispensably necessary  Vir bonus prudens versus reprehendet inertes  Culpabit duros incomptis allinet Atrum  Transverso calamo signum ambitiosa recidet  Ornamenta parum claris lucem dare coget  Arguet ambigue dictum metanda notabit  There is more than one Example of every kind of these Faults in the Tragedies of  Shakespear  and even in the  Coriolanus  There are Lines that are utterly void of that celestial Fire of which  Shakespear  is sometimes Master in so great a Degree And consequently there are Lines that are stiff and forc'd and harsh and unmusical tho'  Shakespear  had naturally an admirable Ear for the Numbers But no Man ever was very musical who did not write with Fire and no Man can always write with Fire unless he is so far Master of his Time as to expect those Hours when his Spirits are warm and volatile  Shakespear  must therefore sometimes have Lines which are neither strong nor graceful For who ever had Force or Grace that had not Spirit There are in his  Coriolanus  among a  great many natural and admirable Beauties three or four of those Ornaments which  Horace  would term ambitious and which we in  English  are apt to call Fustian or Bombast There are Lines in some Places which are very obscure and whole Scenes which ought to be alter'd  I have Sir employ'd some Time and Pains and that little Judgment which I have acquir'd in these Matters by a long and a faithful reading both of Ancients and Moderns in adding retrenching and altering several Things in the  Coriolanus  of  Shakespear  but with what Success I must leave to be determin'd by you I know very well that you will be surpriz'd to find that after all that I have said in the former Part of this Letter against  Shakespear  's introducing the Rabble into  Coriolanus  I have not only retain'd in the second Act of the following Tragedy the Rabble which is in the Original but deviated more from the  Roman  Customs than  Shakespear  had done before me I desire you to look upon it as a voluntary Fault and a Trespass against Conviction 'Tis one of those Things which are  ad Populum Phalerae  and by no means inserted to please such Men as you  Thus Sir have I laid before you a short but impartial Account of the Beauties and Defects of  Shakespear  with an Intention to make these Letters publick if they are approv'd  by you to teach some People to distinguish between his Beauties and his Defects that while they imitate the one they may with Caution avoid the other there being nothing of more dangerous Contagion to Writers and especially to young ones than the Faults of great Masters and while with  Milton  they applaud the great Qualities which  Shakespear  had by Nature they may follow his wife Example and form themselves as he assures us that he himself did upon the Rules and Writings of the Ancients  Sir if so candid and able a Judge as your self shall happen to approve of this Essay in the main and to excuse and correct my Errors that Indulgence and that Correction will not only encourage me to make these Letters publick but will enable me to bear the Reproach of those who would fix a Brand even upon the justest Criticism as the Effect of Envy and Illnature as if there could possibly be any Illnature in the doing Justice or in the endeavouring to advance a very noble and a very useful Art and consequently to prove beneficent to Mankind As for those who may accuse me of the want of a due Veneration for the Merit of an Author of so establish'd a Reputation as  Shakespear  I shall beg leave to tell them that they chuse the wrongest time that they could possibly take for such  an Accusation as that For I appeal to you Sir who shews most Veneration for the Memory of  Shakespear  he who loves and admires his Charms and makes them one of his chiefDelights who sees him and reads him over and over and still remains unsatiated and who mentions his Faults for no other Reason but to make his Excellency the more conspicuous or he who pretending to be his blind Admirer shews in Effect the utmost Contempt for him preferring empty effeminate Sound to his solid Beauties and manly Graces and deserting him every Night for an execrable  Italian  Ballad so vile that a Boy who should write such lamentable Dogrel would be turn'd out of  Westminster  School for a desperate Blockhead too stupid to be corrected and amended by the harshest Discipline of the Place  I am SIR Yours  c  To the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the th of April  YOU know Mr  Spectator  that Esquire  Bickerst aff  attack'd the Sharpers with Success but  Shadwell  is of Opinion that your Bully with his Box and his false Dice is an honester Fellow than the Rhetorical Author who makes use of his Tropes and Figures which are his High and his Lowrunners to cheat us at once of our Money and of our Intellectuals  I would not have you think Mr  Spectator  that this Reflection is directed to you 'Tis only intended against one or two of your Correspondents and particularly the  Innsof Court  man who as you told us in your Second Paper supplies you with most of your Criticism who seems to me so little to understand the Province that he has undertaken that you would do well to advise him to do by you as he has done by his Father and make a Bargain in the gross with some honest Fellow to answer all your Occasions Which wholesome Advice if he proves too obstinate or too proud to take I am confident  at least that he is too gallant a Person to take it ill if once a Week or once a Fortnight I should shew so much Presumption as to cause a Writ of Error to be issued out to reverse his  Temple  Judgment  I cannot wonder that Criticism should degenerate so vilely at a time when Poetry and Acting are sunk so low For as  Hobbes  has observ'd that as often as Reason is against a Man a Man will be against Reason so as often as the Rules are against an Author an Author will be against the Rules Men first write foolish ridiculous Tragedies which shock all the Rules of Reason and Philosophy and then they make foolish extravagant Rules to fit those foolish Plays 'Tis impossible that your Gentleman of the InnsofCourt could have sent you so much wrong Sense as there is in your Paper of the  th  if he had not formerly writ an absurd Tragedy There are as many Bulls and Blunderrs and Contradictions in it almost as there are Lines and all deliver'd with that insolent and that blust'ring Air which usually attends upon Error and Delusion while Truth like the Deity that inspires it comes calmly and without noise  To set a few of his Errors in their proper Light he tells us in the beginning of that Paper  That the English Writers of Tragedy are possess'd with a Notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent  Person in Distress they ought not to leave him till they have deliver'd him out of his Trouble and made him triumph over his Enemies  But Mr  Spectator  is this peculiar to the  English  Writers of Tragedy  Have not the  French  Writers of Tragedy the same Notion Does not  Racine  tell us in the Preface to his  Iphigenia  that it would have been horrible to have defil'd the Stage with the Murther of a Princess so virtuous and so lovely as was  Iphigenia  But your Correspondent goes on  This Error  says he with an insolent and dogmatick Air  they have been led into by a ridiculous Doctrine in modern Criticism that they are oblig'd to an equal Distribution of Rewards and Punishments and an impartial Execution of poetical Justice  But who were the first who establish'd this Rule he is not able to tell I take it for granted that a Man who is ingenuous enough to own his Ignorance is willing to be instructed Let me tell him then that the first who establish'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Criticism was a certain modern Critick who liv'd above two thousand Years ago and who tells us expresly in the thirteenth Chapter of his critical  Spectator  which Pedants call his Poetick  That since a Tragedy to have all the Beauty of which it is capable ought to be Implex and not Simple  by the way Mr  Spectator  you  must bear with this critical Cant as we do with your Speculations and Lucubrations  and ought to move Compassion and Terror for we have already shewn that the exciting these Passions is the proper Effect of a tragical Imitation it follows necessarily that we must not choose a very good Man to plunge him from a prosperous Condition into Adversity for instead of moving Compassion and Terrour that on the contrary would create Horrour and be detested by all the World  And does not the same deluded Philosopher tell us in the very same Chapter that the Fable to which he gives the second Preference is that which has a double Constitution and which ends by a double Catastrophe a Catastrophe favourable to the Good and fatal to the Wicked Is not here Mr  Spectator  a very formal Recommendation of the impartial and exact Execution of poetical Justice Thus  Aristotle  was the first who establish'd this ridiculous Doctrine of modern Criticism but Mr  Rymer  was the first who introduc'd it into our native Language who notwithstanding the Rage of all the Poetasters of the Times whom he has exasperated by opening the Eyes of the Blind that they may see their Errors will always pass with impartial Posterity for a most learned a most judicious and a most useful Critick Now is not your Correspondent a profound and a learned Person and ought  he not to own himself oblig'd to me for this notable piece of Erudition  But he goes on in his dictatorian way  This Rule  says he  whoever establish'd it has I am sure no Foundation in Nature in Reason and in the practice of the Ancients  But what will this dogmatick Person say now when we shew him that this contemptible Doctrine of poetical Justice is not only founded in Reason and Nature but is it self the Foundation of all the Rules and ev'n of Tragedy itself For what Tragedy can there be without a Fable or what Fable without a Moral or what Moral without poetical Justice What Moral where the Good and the Bad are confounded by Destiny and perish alike promiscuously Thus we see this Doctrine of poetical Justice is more founded in Reason and Nature than all the rest of the poetical Rules together For what can be more natural and more highly reasonable than to employ that Rule in Tragedy without which that Poem cannot exist Well but the Practice of the Ancients is against this poetical Justice What always Mr  Spectator  will your Correspondent have the Assurance to affirm that No but sometimes Why then sometimes the Ancients offended against Reason and Nature And who ever believ'd that the Ancients were without Fault or brought Tragedy to its Perfection But I shall take another Opportunity to shew  that the Pactice of the Ancients in  their Masterpieces is exactly according to this fundamental Rule I have no  time to do that in this short Letter because that would necessarily oblige me to shew that poetical Justice is  a much larger Extent than this pro+found Critick imagines but yet I shall give the discerning Reader a hin  of it in that which follows  Poetical Justice  says your Correspondent  has no Foundation in Nature and Reason because we find that good and evil happen alike to all Men on this sid  the Grave  In answer to which he mu  give me leave to tell him that this is no  only a very false but a dangerous Assertion that we neither know what Men really are nor what they really suffer  'Tis not always that we know Men'  Crimes but how seldom do we know their Passions and especially their dar+ling Passions And as Passion is the Occasion of infinitely more Disorder in the World than Malice for where one Man falls a Sacrifice to inveterate Malice thousand become Victims to Revenge and Ambition and whereas Malice has some+thing that shocks human Nature Passion  pleasingly catching and contagious Can any+thing be more just than that that Providenc  which governs the World should punish Men  for indulging their Passions as much as for obeying the Dictates of their most envenom'd Hatred and Malice  Thus you see for ought we know Good and Evil does not happen alike to all Men on this side the Grave Because 'tis for the most part by their Passions that Men offend and 'tis by their Passions for the most part that they are punish'd But this  certain that the more Virtue a Man has the more he commands his Passions but the Virtuous alone command them The Wicked take the utmost Care to dissemble and conceal them for which reason we neither know what our Neighbours are nor what they really suffer Man is too finite too shallow and too empty a Creature to know another Man throughly to know the Creature of an infinite Creator but dramatical Persons are Creatures of which a Poet is himself the Creator And tho' a Mortal is not able to know the Almighty's Creatures he may be allow'd to know his own to know the utmost Extent of their Guilt and what they ought to suffer nay he must be allow'd not only to know this himself but to make it manifest and unquestionable to all his Readers and Hearers The Creatures of a poetical Creator have no Dissimulation and no Reserve We see their Passions in all their Height and in all their Deformity  and when they are unfortunate we are never to seek for the Cause  But suppose I should grant that there is not always an equal Distribution of Afflion and Happiness here below Man is a Creature who was created immortal and a Creature consequently that will find a Compensation in Futurity for any seeming Inequality in his Destiny here But the Creatures of a poetical Creator are imaginary and transitory they have no longer Duration than the Representation of their respective Fables and consequently if they offend they must be punish'd during that Representation And therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical Justice is an equal Representation of the Justice of the Almighty  We freely confess that 'tis but a very narrow and a very imperfect Type of it so very narrow and so very imperfect that 'tis forc'd by temporal to represent eternal Punishments and therefore when we shew a Man unfortunate in Tragedy for not restraining his Passions we mean that every one will for such Neglect unless he timely repents be infallibly punish'd by infinite Justice either here or hereafter  If upon this Foot we examine the Tragedies of  Sophocles  and  Euripides  we shall find that in their most beautiful Pieces they are impartial Executors of Poetick Justice And  'tis upon this Foot that  Aristotle  requires that we should examine them Your Correspondent I must confess is in the right when he says that that Philosopher declares for Tragedies whose Catastrophes are unhappy with relation to the principal Characters But then what Instructions does he give us for the forming those principal Characters We are neither to make them very virtuous Persons on the one side that is Persons who absolutely command their Passions nor on the other side Villains who are actuated by inveterate Malice but something between these two that is to say Persons who neglecting their Passions suffer them to grow outragious and to hurry them to Actions which they otherwise would abhor And that Philosopher expressly declares as we have shewn above that to make a virtuous Man unhappy that is a Man who absolutely commands his Passions would create Horror instead of Compassion and would be detested by all the World And thus we have shewn that  Aristotle  is for Poetical Justice notwithstanding that he is for unhappy Catastrophes And so one would think was your Correspondent For when he enumerates and commends some  English  Tragedies which have unfortunate Catastrophes there are not two of those which he commends whose principal Characters can be said to be innocent and consequently  there are not two of them where there is not a due Observance of poetical Justice  Thus Mr  Spectator  I have discussed the Business of poetical Justice and shewn it to be the Foundation of all Tragedy and therefore whatever Persons whether ancient or modern have writ Dialogues which they call Tragedies where this Justice is not observ'd those Persons have entertain'd and amus'd the World with romantick lamentable Tales instead of just Tragedies and of lawful Fables  'Tis not my Business at present to take any farther Notice of the Errors of your Correspondent perhaps I no more approve of TragiComedies or Tragedies with double Plots than he does But I hope he will not take it ill if I put him in mind that several of the Plays which he recommended before are TragiComedies and that most of them have double Plots But he is vilely mistaken if he thinks that TragiComedy is of the Growth of our  English  Theatres  I shall take another Opportunity to shew him that he is as much mistaken in what he has said of Humours as in what he dictates concerning poetical Justice  I am Your very humble  c  To the SPECTATOR upon his Paper on the th of April  SIR  I Have read over your Paper of the  th  with a great deal of Satisfaction and here return you my Acknowledgments for the Honour you have done me in quoting two of my Verses with Applause I think my self oblig'd in Gratitude my worthy Friend to do as much Honour to your Judgment as you have done to my Imagination and as you have the Goodness to allow me to be an humorous Poet I am bound in Justice to celebrate you for a wonderful Critick and to make it appear that contrary to the Observation of the Author of a late Rhapsody one who has shewn himself no great Poet may be a prodigious Judge Indeed the Observation of that Author is so far from being true that most of the Criticks Ancient and Modern have been no Poets and most of the Poets Ancient and Modern have been no Criticks I cannot find out that any but  Homer  and  Virgil  and  Horace  and  Sophocles  and  Euripides  among the  Ancients were great Criticks For who can believe that has read them that  Apollonius Rhodius Nonnus Lucan Statius  and  Silius Italicus  ever so much as heard that Nature and the Philosophers her Interpreters and Commentators had laid down Rules for an Epick Poem And who that has read the Moderns could imagine that most of their Dramatick Poets had ever so much as heard that there were such things as the Rules As  Boileau  has observ'd of the  French  that some Persons among them had distinguish'd themselves by their Rhymes who never knew how to distinguish  Lucan  from  Virgil  so some among our own Rhimers have been renown'd for versifying who never so much as knew that  Horace  and  Milton  were good Poets And I can on the other side name several who never distinguished themselves by Poetry who yet have oblig'd the World with Criticisms which have been Nonpareillo's and the very TopCritick of all those Criticks is my worthy Friend the  Spectator  Tho' who the Devil could have ever expected to have found my worthy Friend a Critick after he had treated Criticks with so much Contempt in two or three of his Immortal  Tatlers  and particularly in the  th  and the  th  where they are pronounc'd to be the silliest of Mortals Creatures forsooth who profess  Judgment tho' by the way Mr  Spectator  he who professes or practises Poetry and does not profess Judgment in it professes himself an Ass It was from those  Tatlers  and one or two more Mr  Spectator  that I guess'd that you had a mortal A version to Criticism but now I find plainly that they were none of your own but were sent you by two or three damn'd Poets who are a sort of Offenders that have not half the Charity which other Malefactors are wont to shew but bear eternal Malice to their Executioners  Thus the Invectives against Criticks and Criticism were other Peoples you were too wise to write any such thing as knowing that Tast which declines so fast is only to be restor'd and maintain'd by Criticism And therefore instead of writing Invectives against it you have oblig'd the World with the thing it self with Criticism upon Criticism and such CriticismAs those  Tatlers  were the Offspring of some certain Poets which is manifest by their insipid Satyr like the faint Eagerness of Vinegar decay'd nothing is more clear than that the Criticisms could be none but yours For as you may discover  ex ungue Leonem ex pede Hercules  so in this Case the prodigious Offspring speaks and confesses the Gigantick Father  In your very Folio of the  th  of  April  how have you shewn the Fineness of your  Discernment and the Profundity of your Penetration by your Encomium of two Verses of my Translation of the Fourth Satyr of  Boileau  'Tis now thirty Years since I translated that Satyr and consequently was a very Boy at the Time of that Translation yet from that Time to this the stupid Age has been ignorant of the Beauty of that Couplet How very flegmatick a Wretch have I been and how illegitimate an Offspring of Mr  Bays  not to know any thing of my own Excellence till I heard of it from you  How little did I imagine when I translated that Couplet that the great Critick was then in Embrio who thirty Years afterwards should declare it to be a charming Couplet by giving it a place in his neverdying Speculations  I am perfectly convinc'd my most worthy and most ingenious Friend that we Authors are as blind and as partial Judges of our own Works as we are unrighteous one  of other Peoples I was apt to imagine before I submitted my own Opinion to the de+cisive Authority of your Judgment that you would have done more for the Credi  of my Genius and of your own Discernmen  by commending the following Verses of the Fourth Book of the Poem upon the Batte  of  Ramelies  when you had so fair an occa+sion of taking notice of them as you had  the writing the  th Tatler  If I begin the Verses a little higher than the couching of the Cataracts which is the Subject of the  th Tatler  I am confident you will have the Goodness to pardon me and the rather because you discover'd more than a common Satisfaction when you were present with your Friend Mr  A  at the reading those Verses in Manuscript A celestial Spirit visits the Duke of  Marlborough  in a Vision the Night before the Battel of  Ramelies  and after he has said several other things to him goes on thus  A wondrous Victory attends thy Arms  Great in it self and in its Sequel vast  Whose ecchoing Sound thro' all the West shall run  Transporting the glad Nations all around  Who oft shall doubt and oft suspend their Joy  And oft imagine all an empty Dream  The Conqueror himself shall cry amaz'd  'Tis not our Work alas we did it not  The Hand of God the Hand of God is here  For thee so great shall be thy high Renown  That Fame shall think no Musick like thy Name  Around the circling Globe it shall be spread  And to the World's last Ages shall endure  And the most lofty most aspiring Man  Shall want th' Assurance in his secret Pray'rs  To ask such high Felicity and Fame  As Heav'n has freely granted thee yet this  That seems so great so glorious to thee now  Would look how low how vile to thy great Mind  If I could set before thy astonish'd Eyes  Th' Excess of Glory and th' Excess of Bliss  That is prepar'd for thy expiring Soul  When thou arriv'st at everlasting Day  O could embodied Mind but comprehend  The Glories of the Intellectual World  Or I the blissful Secret were allow'd  But Fate forbids to Mortals to reveal  O I could lay a Scene before thy Eyes  Which would distract thee with transporting Joy  Fire the rich Blood in thy illustrious Veins  Make ev'ry Nerve with fierce Convulsions start  Blast all thy Spirits and thy Life destroy  Thou could'st not taste th' Ecstatick Bliss and live  As one who has liv'd thirty tedious Years  And ever since his wretched Birth been dark  His visual Orbs with cloudy Films o'ercast  And in the Dungeon of the Body dwelt  In utter Ignorance of Nature's Works  And Wonders of this vast material World  And has no Notion e'er conceiv'd of Light  Or Colours or the verdant flowry Earth  Or the stupendous Prospect of the Sky  If then he finds some Artist whose nice Hand  Couches the Cataracts and clears his Eyes  And all at once a Flood of glorious Light  And this bright Temple of the Universe  The crystal Firmament the blazing Sun  All the amazing Glories of the Heav'ns  All the Great Maker's high Magnificence  Come rushing thro' his Eyes upon his Soul  He cannot bear th' astonishing Delight  But starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies  So the vast Glories of the upper World  If they were set before embodied Mind  Would oppress Nature and extinguish Life  These are the Verses my most discerning Friend that I thought might have been preferr'd to the foremention'd Couplet especially since they would as it were have introduced themselves whereas the Couplet is dragg'd in by extreme Violence But I submit to your infallible Judgment not in the least suspecting that my worthy Friend can have any Malice in this Affair and insert that Couplet in his immortal Speculations only on purpose to expose me no far be it from me to entertain any such Jealousie of my dearest Friend who is so good so kind so beneficent and who has so often given himself the glorious Title of the Lover and Benefactor of Mankind Who could imagine that one who hath  given himself that glorious Appellation could e'er be prompted by Malice or Passion or Interest thus slily and hypocritically to abuse one whom he had call'd his Friend  I have been apt to believe likewise my worthy Friend that you would have been kinder to your self and to me if instead of commending the foremention'd Couplet you had taken some notice of the following Verses which are in my Paraphrase upon the  Te Deum  especially when you had so fair an occasion to mention them as you had at the writing the  th Tatler  The Couplet of the translated Satyr was introduced by Violence But how very naturally would the following Verses of the Paraphrase have been mention'd either before or after the last Paragraph of the foremention'd Paper where a Spirit is introduc'd who after he has spoke of that part of the Creation which is too little for human Sight comes afterwards to speak of the immense Objects of Nature after this manner  Tat  I must acknowledge for my own Part that altho' it is with much Delight that I see the Traces of Providence in these Instances I still see greater pleasure in considering the Works of the Creation in their Immensity than in their  Minuteness For this Reason I rejoice when I strengthen my Sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote Spaces and take a view of those Heavenly Bodies which lye out of the reach of Human Eyes tho' assisted by Telescopes what you look upon as one confus'd White in the milky way appears to me a long Tract of Heav'ns distinguish'd by Stars that are ranged in proper Figures and Constellations While you are admiring the Sky in a starry Night I am entertain'd with a variety of Worlds and Suns plac'd one above another and rising up to such an immense Distance that no created Eye can see an end of them  Upon the writing this Paragraph how could you avoid the making mention of Verses which had the very same Ideas and Verses which you had formerly mention'd with Applause in private Conversation I know you will answer that you had intirely forgot them and therefore I take the Liberty here to refresh your Memory The Angels are introduc'd in that Paraphrase speaking to God and saying after other things that which follows  Wheree'er at utmost stretch we cast our Eyes  Thro' the vast frightful Spaces of the Skies  Ev'n there we find thy Glory there we gaze  On thy bright Majesty's unbounded Blaze  Ten thousand Suns prodigious Globes of Light  At once in broad Dimensions strike our sight  Millions behind in the remoter Skies  Appear but Spangles to our wearied Eyes  And when our wearied Eyes want farther strength  To pierce the Void's immeasurable Length  Our vigorous tow'ring Thoughts still farther fly  And still remoter flaming Worlds descry  But ev'n an Angel's comprehensive Thought  Cannot extend so far as thou hast wrought  Our vast Conceptions are by swelling brought  Swallow'd and lost in Infinite to nought  How glad am I that the foremention'd Verses were writ before the abovenam'd  Tatlers  Otherwise I should have been thought to have borrow'd from my worthy Friend without making any manner of acknowledgment only adding or endeavouring to add to what I borrow'd a little of that Spirit and Elevation and Magnificence of Expression which the Greatness of the Hints requir'd  'Tis for this Reason that I am glad the Verses were printed some Years before the Prose For you know my dear Friend that a Plagiary in general is but a scandalous Creature a sort of a spiritual Outlaw and ought to be treated as such by all  the Members of the Commonwealth of Learning But a Plagiary from living Authors is most profligately impudent and in so slow and splenatick a Nation as ours most unjust and barbarous For among us any thing that is admirably good is twenty or thirty Years before it comes to be understood And how infinitely base is it in the mean while to deprive an Author of any thing that is valuable in him and to intercept his coming Praise As Laws are made for the Security of Property what pity 'tis that there are not some enacted for the Security of a Man's Thoughts and Inventions which alone are properly his For Land is alienable and Treasure is transitory and both must at one time or other pass from him either by his own voluntary Act or by the Violence and Injustice of others or at least by Fate And therefore nothing is truly and really a Man's own  Puncto quod mobilis Horae  Nunc prece nunc precio nunc vi nunc sorte supremâ  Permutet Dominos cedat in altera Jura  'Tis only a Man's Thoughts and Inventions that are properly his being alone Things that can never be alienated from him neither by Force nor Persuasion nor by Fate it self and tho' another may basely usurp  the Honour of them yet they must for ever rightfully belong to their first Inventor Thus even the richest and the happiest of Men have nothing that is truly and really their own but their Thoughts and Inventions But Authors for the most part and especially Poets have nothing that can so much as be call'd their own but their Thoughts 'Tis for those alone and the Glory which they expect from those that they entirely quit their Pretensions to Riches and renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World and therefore to endeavour to deprive them of those is exceedingly inhuman What a Joy 'tis to think that the Precedence of Times sets me free from the Imputation of this Injustice Had I been capable of doing this and doing it to my worthy Friend of wronging my dearest Friend in this manner who knows how far that Barbarity might have extended it self I might have proceeded to have upbraided him with some weak place in his neverdying Folio's and having forcibly depriv'd him of his Silver and his Gold have pelted him with his Brass and his Copper out of counterfeit Anger or pretended Scorn because they were of no richer Metal  But the Case of my dear Friend is vastly different You have that Reputation and the World has that Opinion of your Merit  that they will be so far from believing that you have Obligations to a living Author which you have not that tho' you had really made thus bold with me it would have been impossible to have convinc'd above forty or fifty People of it And here my dear Friend at the same time that I acknowledge your uncommon Merit I cannot but congratulate your incomparable Felicity it being plain that you have got more Reputation in three Years time than  Milton  has done in fifty Years or than  Shakespear  has in an hundred I shall therefore judiciously conclude with the generality of your Readers that you have a Merit paramount to that of all  British  Authors both living and dead and that you have not only more Merit than any one Moralist either Ancient or Modern but that if you continue your Paper three Years longer you will have as much Merit as they have all together  I am my dear Friend With great Respect and Fidelity Your  c  To  Matthew Prior  Esq  upon the  Roman  Satirists  SIR  WHen you seem'd to approve of the Translation of the seventh Satire of the second Book of  Horace  which was translated by one of my Friends that Approbation was the more pleasing to me because it confirm'd me in my own Opinion of it and oblig'd me to acquiesce in the Judgments which some of my Friends have given of it whom I have always chiefly consulted in my Doubts about poetical Matters And now Sir I come according to my Promise to consult you about the Preference which several Partizans of the  Roman  Satirists have given to their respective Favourite Authors and to know from you which of them are in the right or rather whether they are not all in the wrong You know very well Sir that  Rigaltius Scaliger  the Elder  Lipsius  and  Holiday  prefer  Juvenal  to  Horace  and  Persius  That  Dacier Heinsius  Monsieur  de la Bruyere  and several others prefer  Horace  to  Persius  and  Juvenal  that Mr  Dryden  endeavours to divide the Palm between  Horace  and  Juvenal  and to prefer  Horace  for Instruction and  Juvenal  for Delight that he gives  Horace  the Preference for Instruction because says he he is the more general Instructor but that he gives the Priority to  Juvenal  for Delight because he is most delighted with him and so makes his own Taste the Argument for preferring him But tho' we shou'd grant Sir that the Generality of Readers are more delighted with  Juvenal  than they are with  Horace  because  Dryden  is more delighted with him yet is it not very much to be question'd whether the Author who gives the most general Delight is the most delightful Author Now Sir your old Friend Monsieur  Despreaux  tho' 'tis evident that he was more pleas'd with  Horace  than he was with  Juvenal  because he has imitated him more yet he had more Judgment than expresly to prefer the one to the other because he knew very well that there can be no true Preference where there can be no just Comparison and that there can be no just Comparison between Authors whose Works are not  ejusdem generis  and that the Works of those two Satirists are not  ejusdem generis  For do not you believe Sir that Mr  Dryden  is in the wrong where he affirms that the  Roman  Satire had its Accomplishment in  Juvenal  For is there not Reason to believe that the true  Roman  Satire is of the Comick kind and was an Imitatiou of the old  Athenian  Comedys in which  Lucilius  first signaliz'd himself and which was afterwards perfected by  Horace  and that  Juvenal  afterwards started a new Satire which was of the Tragick kind  Horace  who wrote as  Lucilius  had done before him in Imitation of the old Comedy endeavours to correct the Follies and Errors and epidemick Vices of his Readers which is the Business of Comedy  Juvenal  attacks the pernicious outragious Passions and the abominable monstrous Crimes of several of his Contemporaries or of those who liv'd in the Age before him which is the Business of Tragedy at least of imperfect Tragedy  Horace  argues insinuates engages rallies smiles  Juvenal  exclaims apostrophizes exaggerates lashes stabbs There is in  Horace  almost every where an agreeable Mixture of good Sense and of true Pleasantry so that he has every where the principal Qualities of an excellent Comick Poet And there is almost every where in  Juvenal  Anger Indignation Rage Disdain and the violent Emotions and vehement Style of Tragedy Can there then be a just Comparison made between these two Satirists any more than there can be between a Tragick  and a Comick Poet If Mr  Dryden  were now living would he compare  Nat Lee  with  Etherege  the former of which never touch'd upon Comedy and the other never attempted Tragedy would he prefer  Nat Lee  to  Etherege  as he does  Juvenal  to  Horace  because the Thoughts of  Lee  are more elevated than those of  Etherege  his Expressions more noble and more sonorous his Verse more numerous and his Words more sublime and lofty would he not have believ'd that if  Etherege  had writ Sir  Fopling  in the same Style that  Nat Lee  wrote  Alexander  he would have been as merry a Person as  Penkethman  was when he acted  Alexander  Would he not in all probability have judg'd that  Lee  is more delightful to those who are more pleas'd with Tragedy than they are with Comedy and that  Etherege  is more delightful to those who are better entertain'd with Comedy than they are with Tragedy Now Sir ought not we to make the same Judgment of  Horace  and  Juvenal  and to affirm  Horace  to be more delightful to those who are more pleas'd with Comedy than they are with Tragedy and that  Juvenal  is more delightful to those who are better entertain'd with Tragedy than they are with Comedy And that perhaps for that very reason he was more pleasing than  Horace  to Mr  Dryden  Will not the Tragick Satire which like Tragedy fetches its Notions from Philosophy and from common Sense be in all probability more acceptable to Universities and Cloisters and all those Recluse and Contemplative Men who pass most of their time in their Closets all which Persons are suppos'd to have Philosophy from Study and common Sense from Nature And will not the Comick Satirist who owes no small Part of his Excellence to his Experience that is to the Knowledge of the Conversation and Manners of the Men of the World be in all likelihood more agreeable to the discerning Part of a Court and a great Capital where they are qualify'd to taste and discern his Beauties by the same Experience which enabled their Authors to produce them And above all things must it not be most agreeable to a Polite Court where that dexterous Insinuation that fine good Sense and that true Pleasantry which are united in the  Horatian  Satire are the only shining Qualities which make the Courtier valuable and agreeable And will he not take more delight in the  Horatian  Satire than in the Tragick Eloquence of  Juvenal  not only because he is qualified by Nature and Experience to relish the Beauties of it but because the Pleasure which he receives from it is subser+vient  to his Interest which is always his main Design and Improves and Cultivates those Talents which are chiefly to recommend him to those who are to advance him  It will be needless Sir to detain you any longer by enquiring into the Preference which  Casaubon  has so injudiciously given to  Persius  above  Horace  and  Juvenal  or into the Preference which he particularly gives to the fifth Satire of  Persius  before this of  Horace  the Translation of which has occasion'd the Trouble which I now give you and which you know Sir is writ upon the same Subject Your Friend Monsieur  Dacier  tells us that  Casaubon  by this Opinion prefers the University to the Court I appeal to you Sir if the Satire of  Horace  the Translation of which comes after this Letter does not speak for it self and justifie the Assertion of Monsieur  Dacier  I am SIR Your  c  HORACE  LIB II SAT VII  HORACE  LIB II SAT VII  JAmdudum ausculto cupiens

PennyPostOffice for you in one of which was  The Invader of his Countrey  and in the other the four Letters to Sir  John Edgar  I hope both Parcels will come safe to your Hands and wish they may entertain you  Since I have been in Town I have consider'd the Passage in  Phaedrus Sed hoc feretis pro Judicio praemium  I find that  Virgil  and  Horace  have us'd the Word  Judicium  in three or four several Senses They have both us'd it for the intellectual Faculty which we call Judgment  Horace  has us'd it in this Sense in his Art of Poetry as in this Passage  Tu nihil invitâ dicas faciesve Minervâ  Id tibi judicium est ea mens  And in the Epistle to  Augustus  speaking of  Alexander  the Great  Quod si  Judicium subtile videndis artibus illud  Ad Libros et ad haec Musarum dona vocares  Virgil  has us'd it in his fifth Eclogue for Opinion  Judicio nostro tantum tibi cedit Amyntas  In the first Epistle of the first Book  Horace  uses  Judiciis  for Opinions  Quod si me populus Romanus forte rogat cur  Non ut porticibus sic Judiciis fruar iisdem  Nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit  Olim quod vulpes c  Horace  in the first Satire of the second Book uses it for a Prosecution or a Tryal at Law  Si mala condiderit in quemquis carmine jus est  Judiciumque  And in the fourth Satire of the first Book  Admiror quo pacto Judicium illud Fugerit  But lastly  Judicium  is sometimes taken for a definitive Sentence as  manet altâ mente repostum Judicium Paridis  Now as Penalty or Punishment is the consequence of an antecedent Sentence and no Figure is more commonly us'd either by Poets or Orators than the Effect for the Cause or the Consequence for the Antecedent  Phaedrus  in the Passage in Question uses the word  Judicium  for Punishment as he uses  Praemium  to signifie  Poenam  and so the Sense of the abovecited Verse is  But this shall be your Punishment according to the Sentence pronounc'd against you  And thus much to the Passage of  Phaedrus  I design to come as soon as the Weather is settled and to pass two or three Days at the House where I breakfasted yesterday Morning but I shall hardly care to make a longer Stay among so many Jacobites a Sort of People whom I so much abhor and who so much hate me I can compare them for Malice Credulity and Obstinacy to no Sort of People so nearly as to the  Jews  who have been so many Years in a foolish Expectation of that Messiah who is already come But of all the Jacobites I detest none so much as the Jacobite Parsons and of all the Parsons none so much as those who are for dethroning a Prince to whom they have taken an Oath to be Loyal and for setting up a Pretender whom they have  sworn to renounce I have a great deal more Regard or more Charity at least for the Nonjurors among them I mean that Part of them who live modestly and humbly in Retirement and never meddle with the Government These People seem to refuse the Oaths thro' Conscience but a Conscience erroneous and illguided But as for that Part of the Nonjurors who make it the constant Business of their Lives to plot to cabal to set the People against their King and one Part of the People against the other they are apparently Nonjurors thro' Interest and not Conscience they refuse the Oaths thro' the Hope of another Restoration and the Gain that may attend it It being impossible that any thing so uncharitable and immoral as their Practice can be the Effect of a Christian Conscience Yet ev'n these are nothing near so wicked as the swearing Jacobite Parsons What I said of Dr  Faustus  if you took it rightly was design'd against them for the Person who lives in constant repeated daily Perjury upon the account of Interest seems to me to be capable of any Villany whatsoever and to have done in effect what some credulous Persons believe that Dr  Faustus  did foremrly that is to have given Bond and Judgment to the Devil to surrender their Persons to him after a Term of Time  I am Sir Yours  c  To Sir Richard Blackmore  SIR  I Have lately with a great deal of Satisfaction read twice over the political Letters to the Author of the  London  Journal Several of them seem to come from no ordinary Hands being writ with great Strength and Spirit The great Occasion certainly call'd for all the Strength and Spirit that could be supplied by Man 'Tis indeed so extraordinary that it has no Parallel in any Nation or any Age For that a great Number of the chief Inhabitants of the Metropolis of a powerful Kingdom who were so far from having any Cause of Discontent that they had in their Power all the Felicity that Mortals can enjoy that they actually possess'd more than ever they dar'd to hope for nay more than ever they dar'd to wish for ev'n in their most sanguine Hours but a few Months before That Persons who were esteemed by all their FellowCitizens respected by all their FellowSubjects regarded and highly favour'd by the Government and honour'd  and distinguish'd by the whole Legislature that a Number of these should enter into an execrable Conspiracy irretrievably to ruin their FellowSubjects to distress the Government that had so highly favour'd them and to afflict and perplex the whole Legislature that had so highly honour'd them and all this only thro' the infinitely base and foolish Desire of accumulating Riches of which they had before more than they could ever use is what has never been transmitted to us by Tradition or read of in ancient or modern History  This Conspiracy so new and unheardof that it cannot be equal'd by any Nation in any Age must necessarily have a Cause as monstrous and as unparallel'd and that is an antecedent Conspiracy among a great number of People some by conversing and by writing and some by encouraging these Conversations and Writings to overthrow the Religion of their native Countrey and by that means to let in Corruption upon us like a Deluge And this they have endeavour'd with all their Might to do upon a Pretence the most extravagant that was ever heard of upon a Pretence to advance the Publick Good For their Design was to overthrow the Christian Religion in order to destroy Priestcraft at the same Time they make no Offer to establish any other Religion in the Room of that which  they would destroy Now Priestcraft may trouble and perplex a State but a general Want of Religion must be attended with its utter Ruin For the Religion of every Countrey in which the Natives and their Forefathers have been educated and which is antecedent or coaeval to most of its Laws and Customs that Religion whether true or false is certainly the Basis of that Country's Constitution and may indeed when Corruptions flow in upon it be reform'd and reduc'd to its first Principles but can never be totally abolish'd without unavoidable Ruin For that national Religion is to that Countrey the only Fountain both of general publick and private Virtue and of general publick Siprit and that being abolish'd or very much weaken'd even natural Religion must lose its Force and consequently there can be no general Morality For tho' our Antichristian Authors may make several of their Readers Atheists they can never hope to make the Generality of a Nation Theists without pretending to infuse more Understanding into them than God and Nature ordain'd for them For the Bulk of Mankind in any Nation that is the Peasants the Mechanicks and the Rabble of Gentry are not capable of Theism that is of worshipping without a sensible visible Mediator a Spirit who fills infinite Space or of being convinc'd of their Duty by Arguments form'd by  right Reason and drawn from the Laws of Nature The Bulk of Mankind are entirely sway'd by their Passions and especially by those two pow'rful ones Hope and Fear for which Reason all those fam'd Politicians who have had the greatest Knowledge of Mankind have advis'd the Rulers of Nations to govern them by those two Passions  viz  by the Hope of Reward and by the Fear of Punishment and here I cannot forbear reciting the memorable Words of the great Cardinal  Richlieu  He begins the first Chapter of the second Part of his political Testament thus  'Tis a common but true Saying and therefore the more true because it has been always in the Mouths and Minds of all Mankind that Punishment and Reward are the two most important things to be observ'd in the Government of any State  Nay 'tis most certain that tho' no other Maxim should be made use of in the Government of States than that of being inflexible in chastising those who disserve them and religious in recompensing those who procure for them any considerable Advantage they could not be ill govern'd there being no Man whatever who is not capable of being kept within the Bounds of his Duty by Fear and by Hope  'Tis after the same manner that Religion works upon the Minds of Men The Religion  of the Old Testament speaks strongly to these two Passions proposing mighty temporal Rewards to those who observe the Rules of it and to those who transgress them grievous temporal Punishments The Religion of the New Testament speaks much more pow'rfully to them by causing Men to hope for everlasting Happiness and dread eternal Misery  Now when the Generality of Mankind break loose from that Hope and that Fear they remain absolutely without Religion and are prepar'd to dissemble themselves of any that may gratify their Ambition their Interest or their Revenge which was the Cause that in the two or three last Years of Queen  Anne  so many cry'd out that they had rather turn Papists than be Presbyterians Now by declaring that they had rather be of a Religion which differs from us in Fundamentals than of one which agrees with us in Doctrine they seem'd to renounce all Christianity  'Tis for this Reason that some Persons who are call'd Whigs by writing and encouraging Antichristian Books have shewn themselves to be only nominal Whigs but really and effectually Tories for by endeavouring to root out the Christian Religion in general from the Minds of Men and by leaving them consequently at Liberty to profess themselves of any Branch of it for  their Interest they have for thirty Years together been making their utmost Efforts for the bringing back Popery Slavery and the Pretender because during all that long Space of Time they have been endeavouring with all their Strength and with all their Might to remove the most invincible Obstacle to their Return  Consonant to all that has been said above is what  Machiavel  has declar'd in  Chap    Lib  of his Discourses on  Livy  He tells us in the Beginning of that Chapter  That all States whether Kingdoms or Republicks which would keep themselves from Ruin ought above all things whatever to preserve the Ceremonies of their Religion uncorrupted and maintain it always venerable for there is no greater Sign  says he  of a Country's going to Ruin than to see in it the Contempt of divine Worship  And a litttle lower he adds  for this Reason the chief Magistrates of a Kingdom or Commonwealth ought to maintain the Grounds of the Religion they hold and this being done they shall easily keep their Commonwealth religious and consequently virtuous and united  Which is a just and wise Observation of that fam'd Politician for Faction which naturally tends to the Dissolution of Governments and even of the Constitutions of States proceeds for the most part from a violent Desire of possessing the publick Offices that  Desire from Necessity and that Necessity from Luxury and Luxury and all manner of Vice and Corruption from a Decay of the publick Religion  I have many things more to say to you upon this Occasion But having already transgress'd the usual Bounds of a Letter I shall reserve the rest to another Opportunity which I hope shortly to have In what I have to say as well as in what I have said I shall declare my Sentiments not as a Bigot but as a faithful Lover of my Countrey There is no Man alive who is less a Friend to Priestcraft than my self or to the temporal ambitious Designs of Priests But I shall never endeavour to destroy Religion in order to hurt Priestcraft I know the Balance of right Reason better and am amaz'd at the Conduct of some Statesmen who to shew themselves forsooth notable Metaphysicians prove to all Men of common Sense that they are very damn'd Politicians for as has been said above tho' Priestcraft may disturb a State a general Decay of the publick Religion must utterly destroy it And 'tis for this Reason that in the tenth Chapter of the first Book of his Discourses  Machiavel  has these remarkable Words  Infamous are they and execrable who are the Perverters of Religion the Overthrowers of Kingdoms and Commonwealths  c  I am SIR  c  TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE  SIR  THE Approbation which you gave to my former incourages me to proceed I affirmed in that that the Religion of every Country the establish'd ancient Religion is the Basis of the Constitution of that Country I make no doubt but that if any Religion except the  Mahometan  were established in  Turkey  that absolute Monarchy would be speedily ruin'd That mighty Empire will certainly decay as the Influence of the  Mahometan  Religion grows weaker But what is here affirm'd of Kingdoms and States in general may be said more particularly of Free States Their Liberty and their Greatness equally depend upon the Influence of the Religion established in them When once the various Sects of Philosophers at  Athens  had generally weaken'd the Influence which the  Graecian  Religion before had had on the Minds of the  Athenians  they were no longer that brave and  that noble People who fought for the common Liberty of  Greece  at  Salamis  and at  Marathon  They were no longer that great People who were all on fire with the Thirst of Glory and were fonder of Liberty than of Life the sordid Love of Gold took the Place in their Souls of those two noble Passions And they who in the Days of  Miltiades  and  Themistocles  scorn'd to submit to the most formidable Power on Earth as soon as their Philosophy had got the better of their Religion were ready to submit and betray their Countrey to a petty upstart Invader If we look among the  Romans  we shall find still more illustrious Proofs of the Influence that Religion has upon the Publick Welfare  Machiavel  attributes all the Felicity of that State to the Religion established among them by  Numa who finding  says  Machiavel a very fierce People and being desirous to reduce them to civil Obedience by peaceable ways applied himself to Religion as a thing wholly necessary to preserve civil Society and ordered it in such a manner that for many Ages there was not such a Fear of God as in that Commonwealth which facilitated much any Enterprize whatsoever which either the Senate or those brave  Roman  Courages did undertake Disc on  Livy Lib ch And a little lower in the same Chapter he adds  If a Man considers well the  Roman  History  he shall find of how much Efficacy their Religion was for the commanding of Armies for the reconciling the Senate and People for the preserving good Men and for mortifying the lewd So that if we were to dispute to which of the two Princes  Rome  was more oblig'd to  Romulus  or  Numa  I believe  Numa  would be preferred for where Religion is military Discipline is easily introduced and where they have no Religion and are already warlike this hardly follows  The Authority of  Machiavel  is so very great in political Matters that I cannot forbear the quoting him once more in this very Chapter who a little lower has these Words  Wherefore having well consider'd all I conclude that the Religion introduced by  Numa  was one of the principal Occasions of that City's Happiness for that caus'd good Orders good Orders brought good Fortune and all the happy Successes of their Enterprizes and as the Observance of Divine Worship occasions the Greatness of a Commonwealth so the Contempt of it destroys it For where the Fear of God is wanting it must needs be that either that Kingdom goes to Ruine or that it be supported by the Awe it stands in of the Prince who may supply the Defects of Religion and because Princes are but shortliv'd that  Kingdom must needs have an End quickly according as the Virtue thereof fails  But now Sir if the Religion which  Numa  establish'd among the  Romans  was the principal Cause of the Felicity of that Commonwealth I desire to know whether any thing which had a direct and natural Tendency to the weakening and overturning that Religion had not as direct and natural a Tendency to the weakening and destroying the Commonwealth There are particularly three things in the  Roman  Religion which seem to me to have had a peculiar Influence upon the Happiness of that Commonwealth The first is the pretended Apparition of  Romulus  to  Proculus  when he informed him of his Apotheosis and assur'd him if his  Romans  applied themselves to Arms they should become the Masters of the Universe Now as you know very well Sir that the  Romans  firmly believ'd this what cou'd infuse more Confidence and Spirit into them in their Battels than that Belief  But Sir you know very well that the second thing which had a peculiar Influence upon the Felicity of the  Roman  Republick was their Divinations by the Flight of Birds the Entrails of Beasts and the pecking of Chickens  c The Soothsayings  says  Machiavel  Ch the st Lib the st of his Discourses  were not only for  the most part as we have before observ'd the Ground of the ancient Pagan Religion but they were also the Occasion of the  Roman  Republick's Welfare For which Reason the  Romans  had more Regard to them than to any Order besides and made use of them in their Consular Assemblies in the Beginnings of their Enterprises in drawing forth their Armies into the Field in fighting of pitch'd Battels and in any other important Action either Civilor Military Nor ever would they undertake any Expedition till they had first assur'd the Soldiers that the Gods had promis'd them the Victory For  says he at the end of this same Chapter speaking of the Divination by the pecking of Chickens  there was no other end of this manner of Soothsaying than to encourage the Soldiers to fight for Boldness always wins the Victory  But Sir a third thing which more than any thing had an Influence upon the Felicity of that Commonwealth was what we find in the  Somnium Scipionis  of  Cicero Sed quo sis Africane alacrior ad tutandam Rempublicam sic habeto Omnibus qui patriam conservaverint adjuverint auxerint certum esse in coelo ac de finitum Locum ubi beati aevo sempiterno fruantur  Is it not probable Sir that most of their great Actions proceeded from a Belief of this or else that some of them were downright  Fanaticism We find by  Dionysius Hallicarnassaeus  that the Belief of this was the chief Motive that determined  Vetturia  the Mother of  Coriolanus  to endeavour among so many discouraging Circumstances to prevail upon her Son to draw off his Army from the Walls of  Rome  and not to destroy his Country  If I carry back to  Rome says she to her Son  the hope of a speedy Peace if I return to it with the Assurance that you are reconciled to it with what Transports of Joy shall I not be receiv'd by our Fellow Citizens The small Remainder of time which I am predestin'd by the Gods to pass upon Earth will be attended with unparallell'd Glory And when the Gods put an end to my Life my Happiness will have no end And if it be true that there are different Mansions doom'd for us after we are dead I shall have no Reason to fear those dark and dismal Places prepared for the Souls of the wicked even the  Elisian  Fields those charming Retreats predestin'd for the Souls of the Just will be too poor a Recompence to reward Desert like mine After I shall have preserved  Rome  this City so dear to  Jupiter  I shall be encourag'd to expect a Place in that pure and sublime Region of the Air which we are told is inhabited by the Children of Gods  These Sir were the three Points of the  Roman  Religion which had the greatest Influence on the Publick Success and the Prosperity of their Commonwealth But when at length the  Graecian  Philosophy was brought into  Italy  and the  Romans  began to think what the Moderns call freely  the System of  Epicurus which most prevailed with the Men of Letters and the Men of Vanity appear'd to be directly levell'd at the three foremention'd Points of their Religion and to have a direct Tendency to the rooting the Belief of them from the Minds of Men For whereas the fundamental Maxim of  Epicurus  's  System  is that the Gods never in the least concern themselves about the Affairs of the World they who receive it must refuse all Credit to the Apparition of  Romulus  to  Proculus  after the former's pretended Apotheosis And whereas 'tis a Maxim of  Epicurus  that the World is absolutely govern'd by Chance and that the very Pretence to Divination is nothing but a solemn Foppery this alone was sufficient to destroy the Influence of their Aruspicy and their Augury And then how is the Expectation of a blissful and a glorious distinguish'd Immortality consistent with that third  Epicurean  Maxim that the Soul dies with the Body  Thus Sir did the Frecthinking of the  Romans  weaken their Belief of those Points  of their Religion which were the three principal Sources of their Virtue and their Magnanimity and fatally prepar'd the way for unheardof Luxury and all manner of Vice and Corruption I know very well indeed that this Luxury and this Corruption is attributed by their Historians to their  Asiatick  Triumphs and that fatal Security into which they were lull'd by the Destruction of  Carthage  But let us consider the Words which one of them uses upon that Occasion 'Tis  Velleius Paterculus  in the beginning of his second Book  Potentiae Romanorum prior Scipio viam aperuerat Luxuriae posterior aperuit Quippe remoto Carthaginis metu sublatâque imperii aemulâ non gradu sed praecipiti cursu a virtute Descitum ad vitia Transcursum vetus Disciplina deserta nova inducta in somnum a vigiliis ab armis ad voluptates a negotiis in otium conversa civitas  You see Sir that the Historian here observes that upon the Destruction of  Carthage  the  Romans  did not pass gradually from Virtue to Vice but took a Headlong Leap from the former to the latter Now if 'tis truly said of particular Persons that  Nemo repente fit turpissimus  as I make no doubt but that it is very true 'tis certainly more unquestionably true of a whole and a great People If therefore the  Romans  upon the Destruction of  Carthage  precipitately  broke out into all manner of Vice and Corruption there is no way in Nature to account for this but by truly affirming that their Inclinations were debauch'd long before the Destruction of  Carthage  and that the Ruin of that Rival City did nothing but take off that Restraint which had been upon them before that their Principles of Religion and Virtue had been attack'd and weaken'd for a whole Century before by the loose Philosophy of  Greece  which had been introduced among them about the beginning of the  Carthaginian  War  I could bring Instances from several other Kingdoms and States to shew the Influence which Religion has upon their good or their evil Fortune But enough has been said upon a Subject of which the reasonable part of Mankind is satisfied and especially all the great Men who have lived in every Age For all the great Legislators who have been famous among the Nations for the wise Laws they established have either been really religious or havepretended to be so  For never  says  Machiavel was there any Maker of extraordinary Laws in a Nation who had not his Recourse to God for otherwise his Laws had not been received For several things that are good and expedient are known to a wise Man which have not such Evidence in  themselves that he by Discourse can easily make others conceive them Therefore  says he  the wise Men who would get over this Difficulty have Recourse to a God so had  Lycurgus  so  Solon  so many others whose Design was the same with theirs  All the great Founders of Kingdoms and States have been either really or appearingly religious And therefore as Empire is maintain'd by the same Methods by which it was at first establish'd there is no Precept that  Machiavel  instills with so much Care into the Prince of his Formation as that he should at least appear religious as any one may be satisfied who has Recourse to the  th  Chapter of his Prince All the Conquerors of the World have brought about their Designs by Religion Ev'n  Caesar  himself tho' a manifest  Epicurean  pretended to be of divine Extraction and in order to animate his Souldiers by that Belief the very Word which he gave at the decisive Battel of  Pharsalia  was  Venus Victrix  But as the Legislators and Founders and Conquerors of Empires have had Recourse to Religion for the establishing or encreasing their Empire all the wise establish'd Princes that have ever reign'd and all the great Ministers who have serv'd them have thought Religion necessary for the preserving that Empire which had been at first establish'd by it  Cardinal  Richlieu  in the beginning of the sixth Chapter of the first Part of his Political Testament addresses himself thus to  Lewis  the  th  Dieu etant le Principe des toutes choses le Souverain Maître des Rois et celuy seul qui les fait regner heureusement si la Devotion D V M n' etoit connue de tout la Monde je commencerois ce chapitre qui concerne sa Personne en lui representant que si elle ne suit les voluntes de son Createur et ne se soumet a ses voix elle ne doit point esperer de faire observer les siennes ni de voir ses Sujets obeissans a ses Ordres  And thus Sir have I endeavoour'd to shew that the respective Religion of ev'ry Country is the Basis of the Constitution of that Countrey which as I have endeavour'd to prove by Reason in the former Letter I have pretended to confirm it in this by infallible Experience and Matter of Fact by the Authority of  Machiavel  who is generally regarded as the Prince of Political Writers by the Sentiments of wise Legislators of the great Founders of Empires and great Conquerors by the Practice of all wise establish'd Princes and the Sentiments and Practice of  all the great Ministers who have serv'd them There is no manner of Occasion to tell a Gentleman of your good Sense that by Religion all along in these Letters is meant not only reveal'd Religion but the Religion established in every Country But I thought fit to give at least a Hint of this for the Sake of others into whose Hands this Letter may come  And now Sir what shall we say of a certain Sett of Persons who for these last thirty Years have made it the sole Business of their Lives not only to shew all the World that they are irreligious themselves and vainly value themselves upon it but to endeavour to root out the establish'd Religion from the Minds of others and at the same Time to pretend that they do this for the publick Good and to strengthen the Revolution which such a Proceeding has a natural Tendency to destroy as we shew'd in our former Letter Some of these are the very Persons who cry out with the greatest Vehemence against those who have been guilty of that deplorable Corruption and that fatal Villany which have almost undone a great and powerful Nation And yet I pretend to shew in a third Letter that that prodigious Villany  and Corruption is the necessary Consequence of their own Conversations and Writings and the natural Effect of their undermining the Christian Religion  I am SIR  c  Feb  TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE  SIR  I Asserted in my two former Letters that the establish'd Religion in ev'ry Country is the Basis of the Constitution of that Country and the Fountain of publick Morality And I endeavour'd to prove that Assertion by Reason by the Authority of the most allow'd Political Writers and by constant Experience and matter of Fact I promis'd to shew in this third Letter that the frequent Attacks that have been made for these lost forty Years upon the Christian Religion by Atheists and Deists have been the Cause of the present national Calamity which is like to prove so fatal to us in order to which give me leave to  observe that as the establish'd Religion in every Country is the Basis of the Constitution of that Country so no Religion that ever was in the World ever made it so much its Design as the Christian Religion does to extirpate Avarice and all worldly Interest out of the Minds of Men The Founder of this Religion has more than once declared that his Kingdom is not of this World and that they who will be his Subjects whose Hearts and Affections he absolutely requires must renounce the Prince of this World and ev'ry thing that is his and he has taken the utmost Care both by his Example and by his Doctrine to banish Avarice and all worldly Interest from the Minds of his Followers for which Reason his whole Life was one continu'd Example of a contented and willing Poverty  The Foxes have Holes  says he  and the Birds of the Air have Nests but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head Matthew  Chap V He made this his principal Care in his Doctrine and establish'd his Religion upon this Foundation  Mat  Chap V Jesus  said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell what thou hast and give to the Poor and thou shalt have Treasure in Heaven and  come and follow me  And when the young Man to whom this was said went away sorrowful because he had great Possessions  Jesus  said  Ibid  V  It is easier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God  That is It is easier for a Camel to go thro' the Eye of a Needle than for a Man who loves the Riches of this World to become a Subject of such a Soveraign of another World as requires all his Affections  The Apostles by their Lives gave the same Example that their Master did  Matthew  V  Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee  As they gave the same Example they preach'd the same Doctrine St  Paul  has declar'd Avarice to be Idolatry that is 'tis setting those Affections upon sordid Dirt whose rightful Object is God alone As the End of the Christian Religion is to restore Man to that blissful Immortality from which the Fall degraded him this can be done no other way than by restoring those Affections to God which Man at his Fall withdrew from his Creator and fix'd upon the Creature And therefore the whole Tenour of the Christian Religion the whole Spirit and  Soul of it declare this End aloud The three Cardinal Virtues of this Religion are utterly incompatible with Avarice and Worldly mindedness 'Tis impossible but that any one who has a lively Faith and a lively Hope in the Promise of a blissful Immortality must set his Affections on things above and not on things below and as for the greatest of the three Virtues Charity that and Avarice must be the very Contradictions of each other in their Natures their Designs their Effects and their very Terms  I believe Sir that it is pretty plain that where a Religion thus constituted flourishes it must be attended with great Disinterestedness and with publick Virtue When upon the Resurrection of  Jesus Christ  it was in its full Power we read of the greatest Disinterestedness that ever was heard of  Acts  the  th  And ev'n here among us when it was reduc'd to its first Principles upon the Reformation there was a good deal of publick Virtue and publick Spirit and there never has been so little publick Spirit among us as since the Return of King  Charles  the Second and never so fierce and frequent Attacks against the Christian Religion and as those Attacks have been more frequent and more audacious within these last thirty Years the national Virtue and publick  Spirit have declin'd proportionably and Avarice and Corruption increas'd And now they are arriv'd at their fatal Height we find that they who are believ'd to be most guilty of them are they who have been the great and the constant Favourers of those who made the Attacks  But now Sir as I have shewn that the undermining the Christian Religion has had a natural Tendency to the weakning the national Virtue and the distressing the Government what Acknowledgments shall we make to you who have been for so many Years a Champion for the establish'd Religion and who by endeavouring all that lay in your single Power to stemm this Torrent of impolitick Impiety have like a true Patriot been employ'd in the Service of your Country and making a generous Effort for the restoring publick Virtue and publick Spirit And as one of the noblest Branches of the publick Worship by the Disadvantage of a barbarous Translation lay but too much expos'd to the Scorn and Contempt of Libertines you have bravely rescu'd it from that Oppression and by giving us a new Translation confin'd to the old Tunes and Measures a Translation valuable to the Knowing and intelligible to the Ignorant have put it in our Power to establish an Uniformity of Praise in our Worship as we have done of  Prayer Whereas at present one Parish differing from another in Psalmody the Sojourner and the Traveller when they occasionally come into our Churches are but too often excluded from joyning in the most sublime Branch of our Worship For Prayer is too often a poor selfinterested thing in Comparison of Praise For Prayer is too often the Effect of Fear and of a mean Opinion of the Deity sometimes supposing him to be mutable and sometimes unjust But Praise proceeds from nobler Motives and from nobler Passions from a ravishing View of his Excellence from Gratitude from Admiration from Joy divine and from Seraphick Love Thus Sir have I sent you a simple Sketch of what I intended to say upon this Subject For the Spirits will tire as well as the Limbs and mine are already weary  I am SIR Your  c
