 A Walker sculp  Richard Nash Esq  r    F  om an Original painted by M  r  Hoare and presented to the Corporation of the City of Bath  THE LIFE OF RICHARD NASH Of  BATH    Esq  Extracted principally from His ORIGINAL PAPERS  Non ego paucis  Offendar Maculis  HOR  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY in St Paul's Churchyard and W FREDERICK at Bath  MDCCLXII  PREFACE  THE following memoir is neither calculated to enflame the reader's passions with descriptions of gallantry nor to gratify his malevolence with details of scandal The amours of coxcombs and the pursuits of debauchees are as destitute of novelty to attract us as they are of variety to entertain they still present us but the same picture a picture we have seen a thousand times repeated The life of Mr  Nash  is incapable of supplying any entertainment of this nature to a prurient curiosity Tho' it was past in the very midst of debauchery he practised but few of those vices he was often obliged to  assent to Tho' he lived where gallantry was the capital pursuit he was never known to favour it by his example and what authority he had was set to oppose it Instead therefore of a romantic history filled with warm pictures and fanciful adventures the reader of the following account must rest satisfied with a genuine and candid recital compiled from the papers he left behind and others equally authentic a recital neither written with a spirit of satire nor panegyric and with scarce any other art than that of arranging the materials in their natural order  But tho' little art has been used it is hoped that some entertainment may be collected from the life of a person so much talked of and yet so little  known as Mr  Nash  The history of a man who for more than fifty years presided over the pleasures of a polite kingdom and whose life tho' without any thing to surprise was ever marked with singularity deserves the attention of the present age the pains he took in pursuing pleasure and the solemnity he assumed in adjusting trifles may one day claim the smile of posterity At least such an history is well enough calculated to supply a vacant hour with innocent amusement however it may fail to open the heart or improve the understanding  Yet his life how trifling soever it may appear to the inattentive was not without its real advantages to the public He was the first who diffused a desire of society and an easiness  of address among a whole people who were formerly censured by foreigners for a reservedness of behaviour and an aukward timidity in their first approaches He first taught a familiar intercourse among strangers at  Bath  and  Tunbridge  which still subsists among them That ease and open acccess first acquired there our gentry brought back to the metropolis and thus the whole kingdom by degrees became more refined by lessons originally derived from him  Had it been my design to have made this history more pleasing at the expence of truth it had been easily performed but I chose to describe the man as he was not such as imagination could have helped  in compleating his picture he will be found to be a weak man governing weaker subjects and may be considered as resembling a monarch of  Cappadocia  whom  Cicero  somewhere calls  the little king of a little people    But while I have been careful in describing the monarch his dominions have claimed no small share of my attention I have given an exact account of the rise regulation and nature of the amusements of the city of  Bath  how far Mr  Nash  contributed to establish and refine them and what pleasure a stranger may expect there upon his arrival Such anecdotes as are at once true and worth preserving are produced in their order and some stories are added  which tho' commonly known more necessarily belong to this history than to the places from whence they have been extracted But it is needless to point out the pains that have been taken or the entertainment that may be expected from the perusal of this performance It is but an indifferent way to gain the reader's esteem to be my own panegyrist nor is this preface so much designed to lead him to beauties as to demand pardon for defects  THE LIFE OF RICHARD NASH  Esq  _HISTORY owes its excellence more to the writer's manner than the materials of which it is composed The intrigues of courts or the devastation of armies are regarded by the remote spectator with as little attention as the squabbles of a village or the fate of a malefactor that fall under his own observation The great and the little as they have the same senses and  the same affections generally present the same picture to the hand of the draughtsman and whether the heroe or the clown be the subject of the memoir it is only man that appears with all his native minuteness about him for nothing very great was ever yet formed from the little materials of humanity  Thus none can properly be said to write history but he who understands the human heart and its whole train of affections and follies Those affections and follies are properly the materials he has to work upon The relations of great events may surprize indeed they may be calculated to instruct those very few who govern the million beneath but the generality of mankind find the most real improvement from relations which are levelled to the general surface of life which tell not how men learned to conquer but how they endeavoured to live not how they gained the shout of the admiring croud but how they acquired  the esteem of their friends and acquaintance  Every man's own life would perhaps furnish the most pleasing materials for history if he only had candour enough to be sincere and skill enough to select such parts as once making him more prudent might serve to render his readers more cautious There are few who do not prefer a page of  Montaigne  or  Colley Cibber  who candidly tells us what they thought of the world and the world thought of them to the more stately memoirs and transactions of  Europe  where we see Kings pretending to immortality that are now almost forgotten and statesmen planning frivolous negociations that scarce outlive the signing  It were to be wished that ministers and Kings were left to write their own histories they are truly useful to few but themselves but for men who are contented with more humble stations I fancy such truths only are serviceable as may conduct  them safely through life That knowledge which we can turn to our real benefit should be most eagerly pursued Treasures which we cannot use but little encrease the happiness or even the pride of the possessor  I profess to write the history of a man placed in the middle ranks of life of one whose vices and virtues were open to the eye of the most undiscerning spectator who was placed in public view without power to repress censure or command adulation who had too much merit not to become remarkable yet too much folly to arrive at greatness I attempt the character of one who was just such a man as probably you or I may be but with this difference that he never performed an action which the world did not know or ever formed a wish which he did not take pains to divulge In short I have chosen to write the life of the noted Mr  Nash  as it will be the delineation of a mind without disguise of a man ever assiduous without industry and pleasing  to his superiors without any superiority of genius or understanding  Yet if there be any who think the subject of too little importance to command attention and had rather gaze at the actions of the great than be directed in guiding their own I have one undeniable claim to their attention Mr  Nash  was himself a King In this particular perhaps no Biographer has been so happy as I They who are for a delineation of men and manners may find some satisfaction that way and those who delight in adventures of Kings and Queens may perhaps find their hopes satisfied in another  It is a matter of very little importance who were the parents or what was the education of a man who owed so little of his advancement to either He seldom boasted of family or learning and his father's name and circumstances were so little known that Doctor  Cheyne  used frequently to affirm that  Nash  had no father The  Dutchess of  Marlborough  one day rallying him in public company upon the obscurity of his birth compared him to  GilBlas  who was ashamed of his father No Madam replied  Nash  I seldom mention my father in company not because I have any reason to be ashamed of him but because he has some reason to be ashamed of me  However though such anecdotes be immaterial to go on in the usual course of history it may be proper to observe that  Richard Nash  Esq  the subject of this memoir was born in the town of  Swansea  in  Glamorganshire  on the th of  October  in the year His father was a gentleman whose principal income arose from a partnership in a glasshouse his mother was niece to Colonel  Poyer  who was killed by  Oliver Cromwell  for defending  Pembroke  castle against the rebels He was educated under Mr  Maddocks  at  Carmarthan  school and from thence sent to  Jesus  college in  Oxford  in order to prepare him for the study  of the law His father had strained his little income to give his son such an education but from the boy's natural vivacity he hoped a recompence from his future preferment In college however he soon shewed that though much might be expected from his genius nothing could be hoped from his industry A mind strongly turned to pleasure always is first seen at the university there the youth first finds himself freed from the restraint of tutors and being treated by his friends in some measure as a man assumes the passions and desires of riper age and discovers in the boy what are likely to be the affections of his maturity  The first method Mr  Nash  took to distinguish himself at college was not by application to study but by his assiduity in intrigue In the neighbourhood of every university there are girls who with some beauty some coquettry and little fortune lie upon the watch for every raw amorous youth more inclined to make love than  to study Our Heroe was quickly caught and went through all the mazes and adventures of a college intrigue before he was seventeen he offered marriage the offer was accepted but the whole affair coming to the knowledge of his tutors his happiness or perhaps his future misery was prevented and he was sent home from college with necessary advice to him and proper instructions to his father  When a man knows his power over the fair sex he generally commences their admirer for the rest of life That triumph which he obtains over one only makes him the slave of another and thus he proceeds conquering and conquered to the closing of the scene The army seemed the most likely profession in which to display this inclination for gallantry he therefore purchased a pair of colours commenced a professed admirer of the sex and dressed to the very edge of his finances But the life of a soldier is more pleasing to the spectator at a distance than to the person who makes the experiment  Mr  Nash  soon found that a red coat alone would never succeed that the company of the fair sex is not to be procured without expence and that his scanty commission could never procure him the proper reimbursements He found too that the profession of arms required attendance and duty and often encroached upon those hours he could have wished to dedicate to softer purposes In short he soon became disgusted with the life of a soldier quitted the army entered his name as a student in the temple books and here went to the very summit of secondrate luxury Though very poor he was very fine he spread the little gold he had in the most ostentatious manner and though the gilding was but thin he laid it on as far as it would go They who know the town cannot be unacquainted with such a character as I describe one who though he may have dined in private upon a banquet served cold from a cook's shop shall dress at six for the side box one of those whose wants are only known to their laundress and tradesmen and their fine  cloaths to half the nobility who spend more in chair hire than housekeeping and prefer a bow from a Lord to a dinner from a Commoner  In this manner Mr  Nash  spent some years about town till at last his genteel appearance his constant civility and still more his assiduity gained him the acquaintance of several persons qualified to lead the fashion both by birth and fortune To gain the friendship of the young nobility little more is requisite than much submission and very fine cloaths dress has a mechanical influence upon the mind and we naturally are awed into respect and esteem at the elegance of those whom even our reason would teach us to contemn He seemed early sensible of human weakness in this respect he brought a person genteely dressed to every assembly he always made one of those who are called very good company and assurance gave him an air of elegance and ease  When King  William  was upon the throne Mr  Nash  was a member of the  Middle Temple  It had been long customary for the Inns of court to entertain our Monarchs upon their accession to the crown or some such remarkable occasion with a revel and pageant In the earlier periods of our history Poets were the conductors of these entertainments plays were exhibited and complimentary verses were then written but by degrees the pageant alone was continued Sir  John Davis  being the last poet that wrote verses upon such an occasion in the reign of  James  I  This ceremony which has been at length totally discontinued was last exhibited in honour of King  William  and Mr  Nash  was chosen to conduct the whole with proper decorum He was then but a very young man but we see at how early an age he was thought proper to guide the amusements of his country and be the  Arbiter Elegantiarum  of his time we see how early he gave proofs of that spirit of regularity for which he afterwards became  famous and shewed an attention to those little circumstances of which tho' the observance be trifling the neglect has often interrupted men of the greatest abilities in the progress of their fortunes  In conducting this entertainment  Nash  had an opportunity of exhibiting all his abilities and King  William  was so well satisfied with his performance that he made him an offer of knighthood This however he thought proper to refuse which in a person of his disposition seems strange  Please your Majesty  replied he when the offer was made him  if you intend to make me a Knight I wish it may be one of your poor Knights of  Windsor  and then I shall have a fortune at least able to support my title  Yet we do not find that the King took the hint of encreasing his fortune perhaps he could not he had at that time numbers to oblige and he never cared to give money without important services  But though  Nash  acquired no riches by his late office yet he gained many friends or what is more easily obtained many acquaintance who often answer the end as well In the populous city where he resided to be known was almost synonimous with being in the road to fortune How many little Things do we see without merit or without friends push themselves forward into public notice and by selfadvertizing attract the attention of the day The wise despise them but the public are not all wise Thus they succeed rise upon the wing of folly or of fashion and by their success give a new sanction to effrontery  But beside his assurance Mr  Nash  had in reality some merit and some virtues He was if not a brilliant at least an easy companion He never forgot good manners even in the highest warmth of familiarity and as I hinted before never went in a dirty shirt to disgrace the table of his patron or his friend These qualifications might make the furniture of his  head but for his heart that seemed an assemblage of the virtues which display an honest benevolent mind with the vices which spring from too much good nature He had pity for every creature's distress but wanted prudence in the application of his benefits He had generosity for the wretched in the highest degree at a time when his creditors complained of his justice He often spoke falshoods but never had any of his harmless tales tinctured with malice  An instance of his humanity is told us in the Spectator though his name is not mentioned When he was to give in his accompts to the masters of the temple among other articles he charged  For making one man happy    l  Being questioned about the meaning of so strange an item he frankly declared that happening to overhear a poor man declare to his wife and a large family of children that  l  would make him happy he could not avoid trying the experiment He added that if they did not chuse to  acquiesce in his charge he was ready to refund the money The masters struck with such an uncommon instance of good nature publicly thanked him for his benevolence and desired that the sum might be doubled as a proof of their satisfaction  Another instance of his unaccountable generosity and I shall proceed In some transactions with one of his friends Mr  Nash  was brought in debtor twenty pounds His friend frequently asked for the money and was as often denied He found at last that assiduity was likely to have no effect and therefore contrived an honourable method of getting back his money without dissolving the friendship that subsisted between them One day returning from  Nash  's chamber with the usual assurance of being paid to morrow he went to one of their mutual acquaintance and related the frequent disappointments he had received and the little hopes he had of being ever paid  "My design continues he is that you should go and try to borrow twenty pounds from  Nash    and bring me the money I am apt to think he will lend to you tho' he will not pay me Perhaps we may extort from his generosity what I have failed to receive from his justice"  His friend obeys and going to Mr  Nash  assured him that unless relieved by his friendship he should certainly be undone he wanted to borrow twenty pounds and had tried all his acquaintance without success Mr  Nash  who had but some minutes before refused to pay a just debt was in raptures at thus giving an instance of his friendship and instantly lent what was required Immediately upon the receipt the pretended borrower goes to the real creditor and gives him the money who met Mr  Nash  the day after our heroe upon seeing him immediately began his usual excuses that the billiard room had stript him that he was never so damnably out of cash but that in a few daysMy dear Sir be under no uneasiness replied the other I would not interrupt your tranquillity for the world you lent twenty pounds yesterday to our friend of the back stairs and  he lent it to me give him your receipt and you shall have mine  "perdition seize  e cried  Nash  thou hast been too many for me You demanded a debt he asked a favour to pay thee would not encrease our friendship but to lend him was procuring a new friend by conferring a new obligation  Whether men at the time I am now talking of had more wit than at present I will not take upon me to determine but certain it is they took more pains to shew what they had In that age a fellow of high humour would drink no wine but what was strained through his mistresses smock He would eat a pair of her shoes tossed up in a fricasee He would swallow tallowcandles instead of toasted cheese and even run naked about town as it was then said to divert the ladies In short that was the age of such kind of wit as is the most distant of all others from wisdom  Mr  Nash  as he sometimes played tricks with others upon certain occasions received very severe retaliations Being at  York  and having lost all his money some of his companions agreed to equip him with fifty guineas upon this proviso that he would stand at the great door of the Minster in a blanket as the people were coming out of church To this proposal he readily agreed but the Dean passing by unfortunately knew him What cried the Divine Mr  Nash  in masquerade  Only a  Yorkshire  penance Mr Dean for keeping bad company  says  Nash  pointing to his companions  Some time after this he won a wager of still greater consequence by riding naked through a village upon a cow This was then thought an harmless frolic at present it would be looked upon with detestation  He was once invited by some gentlemen of the navy on board a man of war that had sailing orders for the mediterranean  This was soon after the affair of the revels and being ignorant of any design against him he took his bottle with freedom But he soon found to use the expression then in fashion that he was absolutely  bitten  The ship sailed away before he was aware of his situation and he was obliged to make the voyage in the company where he had spent the night  Many lives are often passed without a single adventure and I do not know of any in the life of our hero that can be called such except what we are now relating During this voyage he was in an engagement in which his particular friend was killed by his side and he himself wounded in the leg For the anecdote of his being wounded we are solely to trust to his own veracity but most of his acquaintance were not much inclined to believe him when he boasted on those occasions Telling one day of the wound he had received for his country in one of the public rooms at  Bath    Wiltshire  's  if I don't forget a lady of distinction that sat by said it was all false I protest Madam replied he it is true and if I cannot be believed your Ladyship may if you please receive farther information and feel the ball in my leg  Mr  Nash  was now fairly for life entered into a new course of gaiety and dissipation and steady in nothing but in pursuit of variety He was thirty years old without fortune or useful talents to acquire one He had hitherto only led a life of expedients he thanked chance alone for his support and having been long precariously supported he became at length totally a stranger to prudence or precaution Not to disguise any part of his character he was now by profession a gamester and went on from day to day feeling the vicissitudes of rapture and anguish in proportion to the fluctuations of fortune  At this time  London  was the only theatre in  England  for pleasure or intrigue  A spirit of gaming had been introduced in the licentious age of  Charles  II and had by this time thriven surprizingly Yet all its devastations were confined to  London  alone To this great mart of every folly sharpers from every country daily arrived for the winter but were obliged to leave the kingdom at the approach of summer in order to open a new campaign at  Aix Spaw  or the  Hague Bath Tunbridge Scarborough  and other places of the same kind here were then frequented only by such as really went for relief the pleasures they afforded were merely rural the company splenetic rustic and vulgar In this situation of things people of fashion had no agreeable summer retreat from the town and usually spent that season amidst a solitude of country squires parsons wives and visiting tenants or farmers they wanted some place where they might have each others company and win each others money as they had done during the winter in town  To a person who does not thus calmly trace things to their source nothing will appear more strange than how the healthy could ever consent to follow the sick to those places of spleen and live with those whose disorders are ever apt to excite a gloom in the spectator The truth is the gaming table was properly the salutary font to which such numbers flocked Gaming will ever be the pleasure of the rich while men continue to be men while they fancy more happiness in being possessed of what they want than they experience pleasure in the fruition of what they have The wealthy only stake those riches which give no real content for an expectation of riches in which they hope for satisfaction By this calculation they cannot lose happiness as they begin with none and they hope to gain it by being possessed of something they have not had already  Probably upon this principle and by the arrival of Queen  Anne  there for her health About the year the city of  Bath  became in some measure frequented by people of distinction The company was numerous enough to form a country dance upon the bowling green they were amused with a fiddle and hautboy and diverted with the romantic walks round the city They usually sauntered in fine weather in the grove between two rows of sycamore trees Several learned Physicians Doctor  Jordan  and others had even then praised the salubrity of the wells and the amusements were put under the direction of a master of the ceremonies  Captain  Webster  was the predecessor of Mr  Nash  This I take to be the same gentleman whom Mr  Lucas  describes in his history of the lives of the gamesters by which it appears that  Bath  even before the arrival of Mr  Nash  was found a proper retreat for men of that profession This gentleman in the year carried the balls to the town hall each man paying half a guinea each ball  Still however the amusements of this place were neither elegant nor conducted with delicacy General society among people of rank or fortune was by no means established The nobility still preserved a tincture of  Gothic  haughtiness and refused to keep company with the gentry at any of the public entertainments of the place Smoaking in the rooms was permitted gentlemen and ladies appeared in a disrespectful manner at public entertainments in aprons and boots With an eagerness common to those whose pleasures come but seldom they generally continued them too long and thus they were rendered disgusting by too free an enjoyment If the company liked each other they danced till morning if any person lost at cards he insisted on continuing the game till luck should turn The lodgings for visitants were paltry though expensive the dining rooms and other chambers were floored with boards coloured brown with foot and small beer to hide the dirt the walls were covered with unpainted wainscot the furniture  corresponded with the meanness of the architecture a few oak chairs a small looking glass with a fender and tongs composed the magnificence of these temporary habitations The city was in itself mean and contemptible no elegant buildings no open streets nor uniform squares The Pumphouse was without any director the chairmen permitted no gentlemen or ladies to walk home by night without insulting them and to add to all this one of the greatest Physicians of his age conceived a design of ruining the city by writing against the efficacy of the waters It was from a resentment of some affronts he had received there that he took this resolution and accordingly published a pamphlet by which he said  he would cast a toad into the spring    In this situation of things it was that Mr  Nash  first came into that city and hearing the threat of this Physician he humorously assured the people that if they would give him leave he would  charm away the poison of the Doctor's toad as they usually charmed the venom of the Tarantula by music He therefore was immediately empowered to set up the force of a band of music against the poison of the Doctor's reptile the company very sensibly encreased  Nash  triumphed and the sovereignty of the city was decreed to him by every rank of people  We are now to behold this gentleman as arrived at a new dignity for which nature seemed to have formed him we are to see him directing pleasures which none had better learned to share placed over rebellious and refractory subjects that were to be ruled only by the force of his address and governing such as had been long accustomed to govern others We see a kingdom begining with him and sending off  Tunbridge  as one of its colonies  But to talk more simply when we talk at best of trifles None could possibly conceive a person more fit to fill this employment than  Nash  He had some wit  as I have said once or twice before but it was of that sort which is rather happy than permanent Once a week he might say a good thing this the little ones about him took care to divulge or if they happened to forget the joke he usually remembered to repeat it himself In a long intercourse with the world he had acquired an impenetrable assurance and the freedom with which he was received by the Great furnished him with vicacity which could be commanded at any time and which some mistook for wit His former intercourse among people of fashion in town had let him into most of the characters of the nobility and he was acquainted with many of their private intrigues He understood rank and precedence with the utmost exactness was fond of shew and finery himself and generally set a pattern of it to others These were his favourite talents and he was the favourite of such as had no other  But to balance these which some may consider as foibles he was charitable himself  and generally shamed his betters into a similitude of sentiment if they were not naturally so before He was fond of advising those young men who by youth and too much money are taught to look upon extravagance as a virtue He was an enemy to rudeness in others though in the latter part of his life he did not much seem to encourage a dislike of it by his own example None talked with more humanity of the foibles of others when absent than he nor kept those secrets with which he was entrusted more inviolably But above all if moralists will allow it among the number of his virtues tho' he gamed high he always played very fairly These were his qualifications Some of the nobility regarded him as an inoffensive useful companion the size of whose understanding was in general level with their own but their little imitators admired him as a person of fine sense and great good breeding Thus people became fond of ranking him in the number of their acquaintance told over his jests and Beau  Nash  at length became the fashionable companion  His first care when made master of the ceremonies or king of  Bath  as it is called was to promote a music subscription of one guinea each for a band which was to consist of six performers who were to receive a guinea a week each for their trouble He allowed also two guineas a week for lighting and sweeping the rooms for which he accounted to the subscribers by receipt  The Pumphouse was immediately put under the care of an officer by the name of the  Pumper  for which he paid the corporation an annual rent A row of new houses was begun on the south side of the gravel walks before which a handsome pavement was then made for the company to walk on Not less than seventeen or eighteen hundred pounds was raised this year and in the beginning of by subscription and laid out in repairing the roads near the city The  streets began to be better paved cleaned and lighted the licenses of the Chairmen were repressed and by an act of parliament procured on this occasion the invalids who came to drink or bathe were exempted from all manner of toll as often as they should go out of the city for recreation  The houses and streets now began to improve and ornaments were lavished upon them even to profusion But in the midst of this splendor the company still were obliged to assemble in a booth to drink tea and chocolate or to game Mr  Nash  undertook to remedy this inconvenience By his direction one  Thomas Harrison  erected a handsome Assemblyhouse for these purposes A better band of music was also procured and the former subscription of one guinea was raised to two  Harrison  had three guineas a week for the room and candles and the music two guineas a man The money Mr  Nash  received and accounted for with the utmost exactness and punctuality  To this house were also added gardens for people of rank and fashion to walk in and the beauty of the suburbs continued to encrease notwithstanding the opposition that was made by the corporation who at that time looked upon every useful improvement particularly without the walls as dangerous to the inhabitants within  His dominion was now extensive and secure and he determined to support it with the strictest attention But in order to proceed in every thing like a king he was resolved to give his subjects a law and the following rules were accordingly put up in the Pumproom  RULES to be observ'd at BATH  THAT a visit of ceremony at first coming and another at going away are all that are expected or desired by ladies of quality and fashionexcept impertinents  That ladies coming to the ball appoint a time for their footmen coming to wait on them home to prevent disturbance and inconveniencies to themselves and others  That gentlemen of fashion never appearing in a morning before the ladies in gowns and caps shew breeding and respect  That no person take it ill that any one goes to another's play or breakfast and not theirsexcept captious by nature  That no gentleman give his ticket for the balls to any but gentlewomenNB Unless he has none of his acquaintance  That gentlemen crowding before the ladies at the ball shew ill manners and that none do so for the futureexcept such as respect nobody but themselves  That no gentleman or lady takes it ill that another dances before themexcept such as have no pretence to dance at all  That the elder ladies and children be content with a second bench at the ball as being past or not come to perfection  That the younger ladies take notice how many eyes observe them  N B This does not extend to the  Haveatalls    That all whisperers of lies and scandal be taken for their authors  That all repeaters of such lies and scandal be shun'd by all companyexcept such as have been guilty of the same crime  N B Several men of no character old women and young ones of question'd reputation are great authors of lies in these places being of the sect of levellers  These laws were written by Mr  Nash  himself and by the manner in which they are drawn up he undoubtedly designed them for wit The reader however  it is feared will think them dull Poor  Nash  was not born a writer for whatever humour he might have in conversation he used to call a pen his torpedo whenever he grasped it it numbed all his faculties  But were we to give laws to a nursery we should make them childish laws his statutes tho' stupid were addressed to fine gentlemen and ladies and were probably received with sympathetic approbation It is certain they were in general religiously observed by his subjects and executed by him with impartiality neither rank nor fortune shielded the refractory from his resentment  The balls by his directions were to begin at six and to end at eleven Nor would he suffer them to continue a moment longer lest invalids might commit irregularities to counteract the benefit of the waters Every thing was to be performed in proper order Each ball was to open with a minuet danced by two persons  of the highest distinction present When the minuet concluded the lady was to return to her seat and Mr  Nash  was to bring the gentleman a new partner This ceremony was to be observed by every succeeding couple every gentleman being obliged to dance with two ladies till the minuets were over which generally continued two hours At eight the country dances were to begin ladies of quality according to their rank standing up first About nine o' clock a short interval was allowed for rest and for the gentlemen to help their partners to tea That over the company were to pursue their amusements till the clock struck eleven Then the master of the ceremonies entering the ballroom ordered the music to desist by lifting up his finger The dances discontinued and some time allowed for becoming cool the ladies were handed to their chairs  Even the royal family themselves had not influence enough to make him deviate from any of these rules The princess  Amelia  once applying to him for one dance more after he had given the signal to withdraw he assured her royal highness that the established rules of  Bath  resembled the laws of  Lycurgus  which would admit of no alteration without an utter subversion of all his authority  He was not less strict with regard to the dresses in which ladies and gentlemen were to appear He had the strongest aversion to a white apron and absolutely excluded all who ventured to appear at the assembly dressed in that manner I have known him on a ball night strip even the dutchess of  Q  and throw her apron at one of the hinder benches among the ladies women observing that none but  Abigails  appeared in white aprons This from another would be insult in him it was considered as a just reprimand and the goodnatured dutchess acquiesced in his censure  But he found more difficulty in attacking the gentlemens irregularities and for  some time strove but in vain to prohibit the use of swords Disputes arising from love or play were sometimes attended with fatal effects To use his own expression he was resolved to hinder people from doing  what they had no mind to  but for some time without effect However there happened about that time a duel between two gamesters whose names were  Taylor  and  Clarke  which helped to promote his peaceable intentions They fought by torchlight in the grove  Taylor  was run through the body but lived seven years after at which time his wound breaking out afresh it caused his death  Clarke  from that time pretended to be a Quaker but the orthodox brethren never cordially received him among their number and he died at  London  about eighteen years after in poverty and contrition From that time it was thought necessary to forbid the wearing of swords at  Bath  as they often tore the ladies cloaths and frighted them by sometimes appearing upon trifling occasions Whenever therefore  Nash  heard of a challenge given or accepted he  instantly had both parties arrested The gentlemen's boots also made a very desperate stand against him the country 'squires were by no means submissive to his usurpations and probably his authority alone would never have carried him thro' had he not reinforced it with ridicule He wrote a song upon the occasion which for the honour of his poetical talents the world shall see  FRONTINELLA's invitation to the Assembly  Come one and all to  Hoyden  Hall  For there's the assembly this night  None but prude fools  Mind manners and rules  We  Hoydens  do decency slight  Come Trollops and Slatterns  Cockt hats and white aprons  This best our modesty suits  For why should not we  In dress be as free  As  HogsNorton  'squires in boots  The keenness severity and particularly the good rhymes of this little  morçeau    which was at that time highly relished by many of the nobility at  Bath  gained him a temporary triumph But to push his victories he got up a puppet shew in which punch came in booted and spurred in the character of a country 'squire He was introduced as courting his mistress and having obtained her consent to comply with his wishes upon going to bed he is desired to pull off his boots My boots replies punch why madam you may as well bid me pull off my legs I never go without boots I never ride I never dance without them and this piece of politeness is quite the thing at  Bath  We always dance at our town in boots and the ladies often move minuets in ridinghoods Thus he goes on till his mistress grown impatient kicks him off the stage  From that time few ventured to appear at the assemblies in  Bath  in a ridingdress and whenever any gentleman thro' ignorance or haste appeared in the rooms in boots  Nash  would make up to him and  bowing in an arch manner would tell him that he had forgot his horse Thus he was at last completely victorious  Dolis{que} ccacti  Quos neque Tydides nec Larissaeus Achilles  Non anni domuere decem  He began therefore to reign without a rival and like other kings had his mistresses flatterers enemies and calumniators the amusements of the place however wore a very different aspect from what they did formerly Regularity repressed pride and that lessened people of fortune became fit for society Let the morose and grave censure an attention to forms and ceremonies and rail at those whose only business it is to regulate them but tho' ceremony is very different from politeness no country was ever yet polite that was not first ceremonious The natural gradation of breeding begins in savage disgust proceeds to indifference improves into attention by degrees refines into ceremonious observance and the trouble of being ceremonious at length produces politeness  elegance and ease There is therefore some merit in mending society even in one of the inferior steps of this gradation and no man was more happy in this respect than Mr  Nash  In every nation there are enough who have no other business or care but that of buying pleasure and he taught them who bid at such an auction the art of procuring what they sought without diminishing the pleasure of others  The city of  Bath  by such assiduity soon became the theatre of summer amusements for all people of fashion and the manner of spending the day there must amuse any but such as disease or spleen had made uneasy to themselves The following is a faint picture of the pleasures that scene affords Upon a stranger's arrival at  Bath  he is welcomed by a peal of the Abbey bells and in the next place by the voice and music of the city waits For these civilities the ringers have generally a present made them of half a guinea and the waits of half a crown or more in proportion to the person's fortune generosity  or ostentation These customs tho' disagreeable are however genarally liked or they would not continue The greatest incommodity attending them is the disturbance the bells must give the sick But the pleasure of knowing the name of every family that comes to town recompences the inconvenience Invalids are fond of news and upon the first sound of the bells every body sends out to enquire for whom they ring  After the family is thus welcomed to  Bath  it is the custom for the master of it to go to the public places and subscribe two guineas at the assemblyhouses towards the balls and music in the pumphouse for which he is entitled to three tickets every ball night His next subscription is a crown half a guinea or a guinea according to his rank and quality for the liberty of walking in the private walks belonging to  Simpson  's assemblyhouse a crown or half a guinea is also given to the booksellers for which the gentleman is to have what books he pleases to read at his  lodgings And at the coffeehouse another subscription is taken for pen ink and paper for such letters as the subscriber shall write at it during his stay The ladies too may subscribe to the booksellers and to an house by the pumproom for the advantage of reading the news and for enjoying each other's conversation  Things being thus adjusted the amusements of the day are generally begun by bathing which is no unpleasing method of passing away an hour or so  The baths are five in number On the southwest side of the abbey church is the King's Bath which is an oblong square the walls are full of niches and at every corner are steps to descend into it this bath is said to contain tons and gallons of water and on its rising out of the ground over the springs it is sometimes too hot to be endured by those who bathe therein Adjoining to the King's Bath there is another called the Queen's Bath this is of more temperate warmth as borrowing its water from the other  In the southwest part of the city are three other baths viz The Hot Bath which is not much inferior in heat to the King's Bath and contains tons hogsheads and gallons of water The Cross Bath which contains tons hogsheads and gallons and the Leper's Bath which is not so much frequented as the rest  The King's Bath according to the best observations will fill in about nine hours and a half the Hot Bath in about eleven hours and a half and the Cross Bath in about the same time  The hours for bathing are commonly between six and nine in the morning and the Baths are every morning supplied with fresh water for when the people have done bathing the sluices in each Bath are pulled up and the water is carried off by drains into the river Avon  In the morning the lady is brought in a close chair dressed in her bathing cloaths to the Bath and being in the water  the woman who attends presents her with a little floating dish like a bason into which the lady puts an handkerchief a snuffbox and a nosegay She then traverses the Bath if a novice with a guide if otherwise by herself and having amused herself thus while she thinks proper calls for her chair and returns to her lodgings  The amusement of bathing is immediately succeeded by a general assembly of people at the pumphouse some for pleasure and some to drink the hot waters Three glasses at three different times is the usual portion for every drinker and the intervals between every glass are enlivened by the harmony of a small band of music as well as by the conversation of the gay the witty or the forward  From the pumphouse the ladies from time to time withdraw to a female coffeehouse and from thence return to their lodgings to breakfast The gentlemen withdraw to their coffeehouses  to read the papers or converse on the news of the day with a freedom and ease not to be found in the metropolis  People of fashion make public breakfasts at the assemblyhouses to which they invite their acquaintances and they sometimes order private concerts or when so disposed attend lectures upon the arts and sciences which are frequently taught there in a pretty superficial manner so as not to teize the understanding while they afford the imagination some amusement The private concerts are performed in the ballrooms the tickets a crown each  Concert breakfasts at the assemblyhouse sometimes make also a part of the morning's amusement here the expences of which are defrayed by a subscription among the men Persons of rank and fortune who can perform are admitted into the orchestra and find a pleasure in joining with the performers  Thus we have the tedious morning fairly over When noon approaches and church if any please to go there is done some of the company appear upon the parade and other public walks where they continue to chat and amuse each other 'till they have formed parties for the play cards or dancing for the evening Another part of the company divert themselves with reading in the booksellers shops or are generally seen taking the air and exercise some on horseback some in coaches Some walk in the meadows round the town winding along the side of the river Avon and the neighbouring canal while others are seen scaling some of those romantic precipices that overhang the city  When the hour of dinner draws nigh and the company is returned from their different recreations the provisions are generally served with the utmost elegance and plenty Their mutton butter fish and fowl are all allowed to be excellent and their cookery still exceeds their meat  After dinner is over and evening prayers ended the company meet a second time at the pumphouse From this they retire to the walks and from thence go to drink tea at the assemblyhouses and the rest of the evenings are concluded either with balls plays or visits A theatre was erected in the year by subscription by people of the highest rank who permitted their arms to be engraven on the inside of the house as a public testimony of their liberality towards it Every tuesday and friday evening is concluded with a public ball the contributions to which are so numerous that the price of each ticket is trifling Thus Bath yields a continued rotation of diversions and people of all ways of thinking even from the libertine to the methodist have it in their power to complete the day with employments suited to their inclinations  In this manner every amusement soon improved under Mr  Nash  's administration  The magistrates of the city found that he was necessary and useful and took every opportunity of paying the same respect to his fictitious royalty that is generally extorted by real power The same satisfaction a young lady finds upon being singled out at her first appearance or an applauded poet on the success of his first tragedy influenced him All admired him as an extraordinary character and some who knew no better as a very fine gentleman he was perfectly happy in their little applause and affected at length something particular in his dress behaviour and conversation  His equipage was sumptuous and he usually travelled to  Tunbridge  in a post chariot and six greys with outriders footmen  French  horns and every other appendage of expensive parade He always wore a white hat and to apologize for this singularity said he did it purely to secure it from being stolen his dress was tawdry tho' not perfectly genteel he might be considered as a beau of several generations  and in his appearance he in some measure mixed the fashions of the last age with those of the present He perfectly understood elegant expence and generally passed his time in the very best company if persons of the first distinction deserve that title  But I hear the reader now demand what finances were to support all this finery or where the treasures that gave him such frequent opportunities of displaying his benevolence or his vanity To answer this we must now enter upon another part of his character his talents as a gamester for by gaming alone at that period of which I speak he kept up so very genteel an appearance When he first figured at  Bath  there were few laws against this destructive amusement The gamingtable was the constant resource of despair and indigence and the frequent ruin of opulent fortunes Wherever people of fashion came needy adventurers were generally found in waiting With such  Bath  swarmed and among this class Mr  Nash  was certainly to be numbered in the beginning only with this difference that he wanted the corrupt heart too commonly attending a life of expedients for he was generous humane and honourable even tho' by profession a gamester  A thousand instances might be given of his integrity even in this infamous profession where his generosity often impelled him to act in contradiction to his interest Wherever he found a novice in the hands of a sharper he generally forewarned him of the danger whenever he found any inclined to play yet ignorant of the game he would offer his services and play for them I remember an instance to this effect tho' too nearly concerned in the affair to publish the gentleman's name of whom it is related In the year there came to  Bath  a giddy youth who had just resigned his fellowship at  Oxford  He brought his whole fortune with him there it was but a trifle however he was resolved to venture it all Good fortune seemed kinder  than could be expected Without the smallest skill in play he won a sum sufficient to make any unambitious man happy His desire of gain encreasing with his gains in the  October  following he was  at all  and added four thousand pounds to his former capital Mr  Nash  one night after losing a considerable sum to this undeserving son of fortune invited him to supper Sir cried this honest tho' veteran gamester perhaps you may imagine I have invited you in order to have my revenge at home but sir I scorn so inhospitable an action I desired the favour of your company to give you some advice which you will pardon me Sir you seem to stand in need of You are now high in spirits and drawn away by a torrent of success But there will come a time when you will repent having left the calm of a college life for the turbulent profession of a gamester Ill runs will come as sure as day and night succeed each other Be therefore advised remain content with your present gains for be persuaded that had you the bank of  England  with  your present ignorance of gaming it would vanish like a fairy dream You are a stranger to me but to convince you of the part I take in your welfare I'll give you fifty guineas to forfeit twenty every time you lose two hundred at one sitting The young gentleman refused his offer and was at last undone  The late duke of  B  being chagrined at losing a considerable sum pressed Mr  Nash  to tie him up for the future from playing deep Accordingly the beau gave his grace an hundred guineas to forfeit ten thousand whenever he lost a sum to the same amount at play in one sitting The duke loved play to distraction and soon after at hazard lost eight thousand guineas and was going to throw for three thousand more when  Nash  catching hold of the dicebox entreated his Grace to reflect upon the penalty if he lost the Duke for that time desisted but so strong was the furor of play upon him that soon after losing a considerable sum at  Newmarket  he was contented to pay the penalty  When the late earl of  Td  was a youth he was passionately fond of play and never better pleased than with having Mr  Nash  for his antagonist  Nash  saw with concern his lordship's foible and undertook to cure him tho' by a very disagreeable remedy Conscious of his own superior skill he determined to engage him in single play for a very considerable sum His lordship in proportion as he lost his game lost his temper too and as he approached the gulph seemed still more eager for ruin He lost his estate some writings were put into the winner's possession his very equipage was deposited as a last stake and he lost that also But when our generous gamester had found his lordship sufficiently punished for his temerity he returned all only stipulating that he should be paid five thousand pound whenever he should think proper to make the demand However he never made any such demand during his lordship's life but some time after his decease Mr  Nash  's affairs being in the  wane he demanded the money of his lordship's heirs who honourably paid it without any hesitation  But whatever skill  Nash  might have acquired by long practice in play he was never formed by nature for a successful gamester He was constitutionally passionate and generous To acquire a perfection in that art a man must be naturally phlegmatic reserved and cool every passion must learn to obey controul but he frequently was unable to restrain the violence of his and was often betrayed by this means into unbecoming rudeness or childish impertinence was sometimes a minion of fortune and as often deprest by adversity While others made considerable fortunes at the gamingtable he was ever in the power of chance nor did even the intimacy with which he was received by the great place him in a state of independance  The considerable inconveniencies that were found to result from a permission of  gaming at length attracted the attention of the legislature and in the twelfth year of his late majesty the most prevalent games at that time were declared fraudulent and unlawful Every age has had its peculiar modes of gaming The games of Gleek Primero In and In and several others now exploded employed our sharping ancestors to these succeeded the Ace of hearts Pharaoh Basset and Hazard all games of chance like the former But tho' in these the chances seemed equal to the novice in general those who kept the bank were considerable winners The act therefore passed upon this occasion declared all such games and lotteries illicit and directed that all who should set up such games should forfeit two hundred pounds to be levied by distress on the offender's goods one third to go to the informer the residue to the poor  The act further declared that every person who played in any place except in the royal palace where his majesty  resided should forfeit fifty pounds and should be condemned to pay treble costs in case of an appeal  This law was scarcely made before it was eluded by the invention of divers fraudulent and deceitful games and a particular game called Passage was daily practised and contributed to the ruin of thousands To prevent this the ensuing year it was enacted that this and every other game invented or to be invented with one die or more or any other instrument of the same nature with numbers thereon should be subject to a similar penalty and at the same time the persons playing with such instruments should be punished as above  This amendment of the law soon gave birth to new evasions the game of Rolly Polly Marlborough's Battles but particularly the E O were set up and strange to observe several of those very noblemen who had given their voices to suppress gaming were the most ready to encourage  it This game was at first set up at  Tunbridge  It was invented by one  Ck  and carried on between him and one Mr  Ae  proprietor of the assemblyroom at that place and was reckoned extremely profitable to the bank as it gained two and an half per cent on all that was lost or won  As all gaming was suppressed but this Mr  Nash  was now utterly destitute of any resource that he could expect from his superior skill and long experience in the art The money to be gained in private gaming is at best but trifling and the opportunity precarious The minds of the generality of mankind shrink with their circumstances and  Nash  upon the immediate prospect of poverty was now mean enough I will call it no worse to enter into a base confederacy with those low creatures to evade the law and to share the plunder The occasion was as follows The profits of the table were as I observed divided between  Ck  the inventor and  Ae  the roomkeeper  The first year's profits were extraordinary and  Ae  the roomkeeper now began to wish himself sole proprietor The combinations of the worthless are ever of short duration The next year therefore  Ae  turned  Ck  out of his room and set up the game for himself The gentlemen and ladies who frequented the wells unmindful of the immense profit gained by these reptiles still continued to game as before and  Ae  was triumphing in the success of his politics when he was informed that  Ck  and his friends hired the crier to cry the game down The consequences of this would have been fatal to  Ae  's interest for by this means frauds might have been discovered which would deter even the most ardent lovers of play Immediately therefore while the crier was yet upon the walks he applied to Mr  Nash  to stop these proceedings and at the same time offered him a fourth share of the bank which Mr  Nash  was mean enough to accept This is the greatest blot in his life and this it is hoped will find pardon  The day after the inventor offered an half of the bank but this Mr  Nash  thought proper to refuse being preengaded to  Ae  Upon which being disappointed he applied to one Mr  Je  and under his protection another table was set up and the company seemed to be divided equally between them I cannot reflect without surprize at the wisdom of the gentlemen and ladies to suffer themselves to be thus parcelled out between a pack of sharpers and permit themselves to be defrauded without even the shew of opposition The company thus divided Mr  Nash  once more availed himself of their parties and prevailed upon them to unite their banks and to divide the gains into three shares of which he reserved one to himself  Nash  had hitherto enjoyed a fluctuating fortune and had he taken the advantage of the present opportunity he might have been for the future not only above want but even in circumstances of opulence Had he cautiously employed himself in  computing the benefits of the table and exacting his stipulated share he might have soon grown rich but he entirely left the management of it to the people of the rooms he took them as he says in one of his memorials upon this occasion to be honest and never enquired what was won or lost and it is probable they were seldom assiduous in informing him I find a secret pleasure in thus displaying the insecurity of friendships among the base They pretended to pay him regularly at first but he soon discovered as he says that at  Tunbridge  he had suffered to the amount of two thousand guineas  In the mean time as the E O table thus succeeded at  Tunbridge  Mr  Nash  was resolved to introduce it at  Bath  and previously asked the opinion of several lawyers who declared it no way illegal In consequence of this he wrote to Mrs  A  who kept one of the great rooms at  Bath  acquainting her with the profits attending such a scheme and proposing to have a fourth share with her and Mr  W  the proprietor of the other room for his authority  and protection To this Mr  W  and she returned him for answer that they would grant him a fifth share which he consented to accept Accordingly he made a journey to  London  and bespoke two tables one for each room at the rate of fifteen pounds each table  The tables were no sooner set up at  Bath  than they were frequented with a greater concourse of gamesters than those at  Tunbridge  Men of that infamous profession from every part of the kingdom and even other parts of  Europe  flocked here to feed on the ruins of each other's fortune This afforded another opportunity for Mr  Nash  to become rich but as at  Tunbridge  he thought the people here also would take care of him and therefore he employed none to look after his interest The first year they paid him what he thought just the next the woman of the room dying her son paid him and shewed his books Sometime after the people of the rooms offered him one hundred pounds a year each for his share which he refused  every succeeding year they continued to pay him less and less 'till at length he found as he pretends that he had thus lost not less than twenty thousand pounds  Thus they proceeded deceiving the public and each other 'till the legislature thought proper to suppress these seminaries of vice It was enacted that after the th of  June  none should be permitted to keep an house room or place for playing upon pain of such forfeitures as were declared in former acts instituted for that purpose  The legislature likewise amended a law made in the reign of queen  Anne  for recovering money lost at play on the oath of the winner By this act no person was rendered incapable of being a witness and every person present at a gamingtable might be summoned by the magistrate who took cognizance of the affair No privilege of parliament was allowed to those convicted of having gamingtables in their  houses Those who lost ten pounds at one time were liable to be indicted within six months after the offence was committed and being convicted were to be fined five times the value of the sum won or lost for the use of the poor Any offender before conviction discovering another so as to be convicted was to be discharged from the penalties incurred by his own offences  By this wise and just act all  Nash  's future hopes of succeeding by the tables were blown up He had now only the justice and generosity of his confederates to trust to but that he soon found to be a vain expectation for if we can depend on his own memorials what at one time they confessed they would at another deny and tho' upon some occasions they seemed at variance with each other yet when they were to oppose him whom they considered as a common enemy they generally united with confidence and success He now therefore had nothing but a lawsuit to confide in for redress and this is ever the last expedient to retrieve a  desperate fortune He accordingly threw his suit into Chancery and by this means the public became acquainted with what he had long endeavoured to conceal They now found that he was himself concerned in the gamingtables of which he only seemed the conductor and that he had shared part of the spoil tho' he complained of having been defrauded of a just share  The success of his suit was what might have been naturally expected he had but at best a bad cause and as the oaths of the defendants were alone sufficient to cast him in Chancery it was not surprizing that he was nonsuited But the consequence of this affair was much more fatal than he had imagined it lessened him in the esteem of the public it drew several enemies against him and in some measure diminished the authority of any defence he could make From that time about the year I find this poor goodnatured but misguided man involved in continual disputes every day calumniated with some  new slander and continually endeavouring to obviate its effects  Upon these occasions his usual method was by printed bills handed about among his acquaintance to inform the public of his most private transactions with some of those creatures with whom he had formerly associated but these apologies served rather to blacken his antagonists than to vindicate him They were in general extremely ill written confused obscure and sometimes unintelligible By these however it appeard that  W  was originally obliged to him for the resort of company to his room that lady  H  who had all the company before  W  's room was built offered Mr  Nash  an hundred pound for his protection which he refused having previously promised to support Mrs  W  It appears by these apologies that the persons concerned in the rooms made large fortunes while he still continued in pristine indigence and that his nephew for whom he had at first  secured one of the rooms was left in as great distress as he  His enemies were not upon this occasion contented with aspersing him as a confederate with sharpers they even asserted that he spent and embezzled the subscriptions of gentlemen and ladies which were given for useful or charitable purposes But to such aspersions he answered by declaring to use his own expression before God and man that he never diverted one shilling of the said subscriptions to his own use nor was he ever thought to have done it till new enemies started up against him Perhaps the reader may be curious to see one of these memorials written by himself and I will indulge his curiosity merely to shew a specimen of the stile and manner of a man whose whole life was past in a round of gaiety and conversation whose jests were a thousand times repeated and whose company was courted by every son and daughter of fashion The following is particularly levelled against those who in the latter  part of his life took every opportunity to traduce his character  A MONITOR  For the Lord hateth lying and deceitful lips  PSAL  "THE curse denounced in my motto is sufficient to intimidate any person who is not quite abandoned in their evil ways and who have any fear of God before their eyes everlasting burnings are a terrible reward for their misdoings and nothing but the most hardened sinners will oppose the judgments of heaven being without end This reflection must be shocking to such as are conscious to themselves of having erred from the sacred dictates of the Psalmist and who following the blind impulse of passion daily forging lies and deceit to annoy their neighbour But there are joys in heaven which they can never arrive at whose whole study is to destroy the peace  and harmony and good order of society in this place"  This carries little the air of a bagatelle it rather seems a sermon in miniature so different are some men in the closet and in conversation The following I have taken at random from an heap of other memorials all tending to set his combination with the aforementioned partners in a proper light  EO was first set up in  Ae  room the profits divided between one  Ck  the inventor of the game and  Ae    The next year  Ae  finding the game so advantageous turned  Ck  out of his room and set the game up himself but  Ck  and his friends hired the crier to cry the game down upon which  Ae  came running to me to stop it after he had cried it once which I immediately did and turned the crier off the walks  Then  Ae  asked me to go a fourth with him in the bank which I consented to  Ck  next day took me into his room which he had hired and proffered me to go half with him which I refused being engaged before to  Ae    Je  then set up the same game and complained that he had not half play at his room upon which I made them agree to join their banks and divide equally the gain and loss and I to go the like share in the bank  I taking them to be honest never enquired what was won or lost and thought they paid me honestly 'till it was discovered that they had defrauded me of guineas  I then arrested  Ae  who told me I must go into Chancery and that I should begin with the people of  Bath  who had cheated me of ten times as much and told my attorney that  Je  had cheated  me of and wrote me word that I had not under his hand which never was used in play  Upon my arresting  Ae  I received a letter not to prosecute  Je  for he would be a very good witness I writ a discharge to  Je  for l in full though he never paid me a farthing upon his telling me if his debts were paid he was not worth a shilling  Every article of this I can prove from  Ae  's own mouth as a reason that he allowed the bank keepers but  per cent  because I went and his suborning * * * to alter his informations  RICHARD NASH  This gentleman's simplicity in trusting persons whom he had no previous reasons to place confidence in seems to be one of those lights into his character which while they impeach his understanding do honour to his benevolence The low and timid are ever suspicious but a heart impressed  with honourable sentiments expects from others sympathetic sincerity  But now that we have viewed his conduct as a gamester and seen him on that side of his character which is by far the most unfavourable seen him declining from his former favour and esteem the just consequence of his quitting tho' but ever so little the paths of honour let me turn to those brighter parts of his life and character which gained the affection of his friends the esteem of the corporation which he assisted and may possibly attract the attention of posterity By his successes we shall find that figuring in life proceeds less from the possession of great talents than from the proper application of moderate ones Some great minds are only fitted to put forth their powers in the storm and the occasion is often wanting during a whole life for a great exertion but trifling opportunities of shining are almost every hour offered to the little sedulous mind and a person thus employed is not only more  pleasing but more useful in a state of tranquil society  Tho' gaming first introduced him into polite company this alone could hardly have carried him forward without the assistance of a genteel address much vivacity some humour and some wit But once admitted into the circle of the Beau Monde he then laid claim to all the privileges by which it is distinguished Among others in the early part of his life he entered himself professedly into the service of the fair sex he set up for a man of gallantry and intrigue and if we can credit the boasts of his old age he often succeeded In fact the business of love somewhat resembles the business of physic no matter for qualifications he that makes vigorous pretensions to either is surest of success Nature had by no means formed Mr  Nash  for a Beau Garçon his person was clumsey too large and aukward and his features harsh strong and peculiarly irregular yet even with those disadvantages he made love became an universal  admirer of the sex and was universally admired He was possessed at least of some requisites of a lover He had assiduity flattery fine cloaths and as much wit as the ladies he addressed Wit flattery and fine cloaths he used to say were enough to debauch a nunnery But my fair readers of the present day are exempt from this scandal and it is no matter now what he said of their grandmothers  As  Nestor  was a man of three ages so  Nash  sometimes humorously called himself a beau of three generations He had seen flaxen bobs succeeded by majors which in their turn gave way to negligents which were at last totally routed by bags and ramilees The manner in which gentlemen managed their amours in these different ages of fashion were not more different than their perriwigs The lover in the reign of king  Charles  was solemn majestic and formal He visited his mistress in state Languished for the favour kneeled when he toasted his  goddess walked with solemnity performed the most trifling things with decorum and even took snuff with a flourish The beau of the latter part of queen  Ann  's reign was disgusted with so much formality he was pert smart and lively his billetdoux were written in a quite different stile from that of his antiquated predecessor he was ever laughing at his own ridiculous situation till at last he persuaded the lady to become as ridiculous as himself The beau of the third age in which Mr  Nash  died was still more extraordinary than either his whole secret in intrigue consisted in perfect indifference The only way to make love now I have heard Mr  Nash  say was to take no manner of notice of the lady which method was found the surest way to secure her affections  However these things be this gentleman's successes in amour were in reality very much confined in the second and third age of intrigue his character was too public for a lady to consign her reputation  to his keeping But in the beginning of life it is said he knew the secret history of the times and contributed himself to swell the page of scandal Were I upon the present occasion to hold the pen of a novelist I could recount some amours in which he was successful I could fill a volume with little anecdotes which contain neither pleasure nor instruction with histories of professing lovers and poor believing girls deceived by such professions But such adventures are easily written and as easily atchieved The plan even of fictitious novel is quite exhausted but truth which I have followed here and ever design to follow presents in the affair of love scarce any variety The manner in which one reputation is lost exactly resembles that by which another is taken away The gentleman begins at timid distance grows more bold becomes rude till the lady is married or undone such is the substance of every modern novel nor will I gratify the pruriency of folly  at the expence of every other pleasure my narration may afford  Mr  Nash  did not long continue an universal gallant but in the earlier years of his reign entirely gave up his endeavours to deceive the sex in order to become the honest protector of their innocence the guardian of their reputation and a friend to their virtue  This was a character he bore for many years and supported it with integrity assiduity and success It was his constant practice to do every thing in his power to prevent the fatal consequences of rash and inconsiderate love and there are many persons now alive who owe their present happiness to his having interrupted the progress of an amour that threatened to become unhappy or even criminal by privately making their guardians or parents acquainted with what he could discover  I shall beg leave to give some instances of Mr  Nash  's goodnature on these occasions as I have had the accounts from himself At the conclusion of the treaty of peace at  Utrecht  colonel  M  was one of the thoughtless agreeable gay creatures that drew the attention of the company at  Bath  He danced and talked with great vivacity and when he gamed among the ladies he shewed that his attention was employed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes His own fortune however was a trifle when compared to the elegance of his expence and his imprudence at last was so great that it obliged him to sell an annuity arising from his commission to keep up his splendor a little longer  However thoughtless he might be he had the happiness of gaining the affections of Miss  L  whose father designed her a very large fortune This lady was courted by a nobleman of distinction but she refused his addresses resolved upon  gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice The intrigue went on successfully between her and the colonel and they both would certainly have been married and been undone had not Mr  Nash  apprized her father of their intentions The old gentleman recalled his daughter from  Bath  and offered Mr  Nash  a very considerable present for the care he had taken which he refused  In the mean time colonel  M  had an intimation how his intrigue came to be discovered and by taxing Mr  Nash  sound that his suspicions were not without foundation A challenge was the immediate consequence which the king of  Bath  conscious of having only done his duty thought proper to decline As none are permitted to wear swords at  Bath  the colonel found no opportunity of gratifying his resentment and waited with impatience to find Mr  Nash  in town to require proper satisfaction  During this interval however he found his creditors become too importunate for him to remain longer at  Bath  and his finances and credit being quite exhausted he took the desperate resolution of going over to the  Dutch  army in  Flanders  where he enlisted himself a volunteer Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private centinel with the additional misery of receiving no pay and his friends in  England  gave out that he was shot at the battle of  In the mean time the nobleman pressed his passion with ardour but during the progress of his amour the young lady's father died and left her heiress to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year She thought herself now disengaged from her former passion An absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the colonel and the assiduity the merit and real regard of the gentleman who still continued to solicit her were almost too powerful for her constancy Mr  Nash    in the mean time took every opportunity of enquiring after colonel  M  and found that he had for some time been returned to  England  but changed his name in order to avoid the fury of his creditors and that he was entered into a company of strolling players who were at that time exhibiting at  Peterborough    He now therefore thought he owed the colonel in justice an opportunity of promoting his fortune as he had once deprived him of an occasion of satisfying his love Our Beau therefore invited the lady to be of a party to  Peterborough  and offered his own equipage which was then one of the most elegant in  England  to conduct her there The proposal being accepted the lady the nobleman and Mr  Nash  arrived in town just as the players were going to begin  Colonel  M  who used every means of remaining  incognito  and who was too proud to make his distresses known to any of his former acquaintance was now degraded  into the character of  Tom  in the  Conscious Lovers  Miss  L  was placed in the foremost row of the spectators her lord on one side and the impatient  Nash  on the other when the unhappy youth appeared in that despicable situation upon the stage The moment he came on his former mistress struck his view but his amazement was encreased when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sate behind her He was incapable of proceeding and scarce knowing what he did he flew and caught her in his arms  Colonel cried  Nash  when they were in some measure recovered you once thought me your enemy because I endeavoured to prevent you both from ruining each other you were then wrong and you have long had my forgiveness If you love well enough now for matrimony you fairly have my consent and dn him say I that attempts to part you Their nuptials were solemnized soon after and affluence added a zest to all their future enjoyments Mr  Nash  had the  thanks of each and he afterwards spent several agreeable days in that society which he had contributed to render happy  I shall beg the reader's patience while I give another instance in which he ineffectually offered his assistance and advice This story is not from himself but told us partly by Mr  Wood  the architect of  Bath  as it fell particularly within his own knowledge and partly from another memoir to which he refers  Miss  Sylvia S  was descended from one of the best families in the kingdom and was left a large fortune upon her Sister's decease She had early in life been introduced into the best company and contracted a passion for elegance and expence It is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty and very beautiful and such circumstances are so surely expected that they are scarce attended to But whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty were excelled in the perfections  of this young lady Her superiority in both was allowed by all who either heard or had seen her She was naturally gay generous to a fault goodnatured to the highest degree affable in conversation and some of her letters and other writings as well in verse as prose would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this or any other age had they been published  But these great qualifications were marked by another which lessened the value of them all She was imprudent But let it not be imagined that her reputation or honour suffered by her imprudence I only mean she had no knowledge of the use of money she relieved distress by putting herself into the circumstances of the object whose wants she supplied  She was arrived at the age of nineteen when the croud of her lovers and the continual repetition of new flattery had taught her to think she could never be forsaken and never poor Young ladies  are apt to expect a certainty of success from a number of lovers and yet I have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers that found an husband in any Before the choice is fixed she has either lost her reputation or her good sense and the loss of either is sufficient to consign her to perpetual virginity  Among the number of this young lady's lovers was the celebrated  S  who at that time went by the name of  the goodnatured man  This gentleman with talents that might have done honour to humanity suffered himself to fall at length into the lowest state of debasement He followed the dictates of every newest passion his love his pity his generosity and even his friendships were all in excess he was unable to make head against any of his sensations or desires but they were in general worthy wishes and desires for he was constitutionally virtuous This gentleman who at last died in a goal was at that time this lady's envied favourite  It is probable that he thoughtless creature had no other prospect from this amour but that of passing the present moments agreeably He only courted dissipation but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happiness At length however his debts amounting to a considerable sum he was arrested and thrown into prison He endeavoured at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress and took a fatal resolution of freeing him from confinement by discharging all the demands of his creditors  Mr  Nash  was at that time in  London  and represented to the thoughtless young lady that such a measure would effectually ruin both that so warm a concern for the interests of Mr  S  would in the first place quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our sex and what was worse lessen her reputation in those of her own He added that thus bringing Mr  S  from prison would be only a temporary  relief that a mind so generous as his would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude and instead of improving in friendship or affection he would only study to avoid a creditor he could never repay that tho' small favours produce goodwill great ones destroy friendship These admonitions however were disregarded and she too late found the prudence and truth of her adviser In short her fortune was by this means exhausted and with all her attractions she found her acquaintance began to disesteem her in proportion as she became poor  In this situation she accepted Mr  Nash  's invitation of returning to  Bath  he promised to introduce her to the best company there and he was assured that her merit would do the rest upon her very first appearance ladies of the highest distinction courted her friendship and esteem but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it Yet still as if from habit she followed the  crowd in its levities and frequented those places where all persons endeavour to forget themselves in the bustle of ceremony and shew  Her beauty her simplicity and her unguarded situation soon drew the attention of a designing wretch who at that time kept one of the rooms at  Bath  and who thought that this lady's merit properly managed might turn to good account This woman's name was dame  Lindsey  a creature who though vicious was in appearance sanctified and though designing had some wit and humour She began by the humblest assiduity to ingratiate herself with miss  S  shewed that she could be amusing as a companion and by frequent offers of money proved that she could be useful as a friend Thus by degrees she gained an entire ascendant over this poor thoughtless deserted girl and in less than one year namely about Miss  S  without ever transgressing the laws of virtue had entirely lost her reputation Whenever a person was wanting to make up a  party for play at dame  Lindsey  's  Sylvia  as she was then familiarly called was sent for and was obliged to suffer all those slights which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of fortune  In most even the greatest minds the heart at last becomes level with the meanness of its condition but in this charming girl it struggled hard with adversity and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance  But tho' in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection yet Mr  Wood  the architect avers that he could never by the strictest observations perceive her to be tainted with any other vice than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gamingtable and at her own hazard playing for the amusement and advantage of others Her friend Mr  Nash  therefore thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with dame  Lindsey  and to rent part of Mr  Wood  's house in  Queen square  where she behaved with the utmost complaisance regularity and virtue  In this situation her detestation of life still continued she found that time would infallibly deprive her of part of her attractions and that continual solicitude would impair the rest With these reflections she would frequently entertain herself and an old faithful maid in the vales of  Bath  when ever the weather would permit them to walk out She would even sometimes start questions in company with seeming unconcern in order to know what act of suicide was easiest and which was attended with the smallest pain When tired with exercise she generally retired to meditation and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest But when the weather prevented her usual exercise and her sleep was thus more difficult she made it a rule to rise from her bed and walk about her chamber till she began to find an inclination for repose  This custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room And the maid usually when she withdrew locked the chamber door and pushing the key under it beyond reach her mistress by that constant method lay undisturbed till seven o' clock in the morning then she arose unlocked the door and rang the bell as a signal for the maid to return  This state of seeming piety regularity and prudence continued for some time till the gay celebrated toasted miss  Silvia  was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived She was unable to keep company for want of the elegancies of dress that are the usual passport among the polite and she was too haughty to seem to want them The fashionable the amusing and the polite in society now seldom visited her and from being once the object of every eye she was now deserted by all and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own imprudence  Mr  Wood  and part of his family were gone to  London  Miss  Silvia  was left with the rest as a governess at  Bath  She sometimes saw Mr  Nash  and acknowledged the friendship of his admonitions tho' she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice Upon the close of the day in which Mr  Wood  was expected to return from  London  she expressed some uneasiness at the disappointment of not seeing him took particular care to settle the affairs of his family and then as usual sate down to meditation She now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct and her approaching misery she saw that even affluence gave her no real happiness and from indigence she thought nothing could be hoped but lingering calamity She at length conceived the fatal resolution of leaving a life in which she could see no corner for comfort and terminating a scene of imprudence in suicide  Thus resolved she sate down at her diningroom window and with cool intrepidity  wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window  O death thou pleasing end of human woe  Thou cure for life Thou greatest good below  Still may'st thou fly the coward and the slave  And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave  She then went into company with the most chearful serenity talked of indifferent subjects till supper which she ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family There she spent the remaining hours preceding bedtime in dandling two of Mr  Wood  's children on her knees In retiring from thence to her chamber she went into the nursery to take her leave of another child as it lay sleeping in the cradle Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks and the consciousness of her meditated guilt she could not avoid bursting into tears and hugging it in her arms she then bid her old servant a good night for the first  time she had ever done so and went to bed as usual  It is probable she soon quitted her bed and was seized with an alternation of passions before she yielded to the impulse of despair She dressed herself in clean linnen and white garments of every kind like a bridemaid Her gown was pinned over her breast just as a nurse pins the swaddling cloaths of an infant A pink silk girdle was the instrument with which she resolved to terminate her misery and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread The end of the former was tied with a noose and the latter with three knots at a small distance from one another  Thus prepared she sate down again and read for she left the book open at that place in the story of  Olympia  in the  Orlando Furioso  of  Ariosto  where by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bosom friend she was ruined and left to the mercy of an unpitying world This tragical event  gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose so standing upon a stool and flinging the girdle which was tied round her neck over a closetdoor that opened into her chamber she remained suspended Her weight however broke the girdle and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the house about half an hour after two o'clock  Recovering herself she began to walk about the room as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident again went to sleep She once more therefore had recourse to a stronger girdle made of silver thread and this kept her suspended till she died  Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell and protracted her patience hour after hour till two o' clock in the afternoon when the workmen at length entering  the room through the window found their unfortunate mistress still hanging and quite cold The coroner's jury being impanelled brought in their verdict lunacy and her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave at the charge of a female companion with whom she had for many years an inseparable intimacy  Thus ended a female wit a toast and a gamester loved admired and forsaken Formed for the delight of society fallen by imprudence into an object of pity Hundreds in high life lamented her fate and wished when too late to redress her injuries They who once had helped to impair her fortune now regretted that they had assisted in so mean a pursuit The little effects she had left behind were bought up with the greatest avidity by those who desired to preserve some token of a companion that once had given them such delight The remembrance of every virtue she was possessed of was now improved by pity Her former follies were few  but the last swelled them to a large amount And she remains the strongest instance to posterity that want of prudence alone almost cancels every other virtue  In all this unfortunate lady's affairs Mr  Nash  took a peculiar concern he directed her when they played advised her when she deviated from the rules of caution and performed the last offices of friendship after her decease by raising the auction of her little effects  But he was not only the assistant and the friend of the fair sex but also their defender He secured their persons from insult and their reputations from scandal Nothing offended him more than a young fellow's pretending to receive favours from ladies he probably never saw nothing pleased him so much as seeing such a piece of deliberate mischief punished Mr  Nash  and one of his friends being newly arrived at  Tunbridge  from  Bath  were one day on the walks and seeing a young fellow of fortune with whom they had some  slight acquaintance joined him After the usual chat and news of the day was over Mr  Nash  asked him how long he had been at the wells and what company was there The other replied he had been at  Tunbridge  a month but as for company he could find as good at a  Tyburn  ball Not a soul was to be seen except a parcel of gamesters and whores who would grant the last favour for a single stake at the Pharaoh bank  "Look you there continued he that Goddess of midnight so fine at t'other end of the walks by Jove she was mine this morning for half a guinea And she there who brings up the rear with powdered hair and dirty ruffles she's pretty enough but cheap perfectly cheap why my boys to my own knowledge you may have her for a crown and a dish of chocolate into the bargain Last  Wednesday  night we were happy"  Hold there sir cried the gentleman as for your having the first lady it is possible it may be true and I intend to ask her about it for she is my sister but as to your lying with the other last  Wednesday  I am sure you are a lying rascalshe is my wife and we came here but last night The Buck vainly asked pardon the gentleman was going to give him proper chastisement when Mr  Nash  interposed in his behalf and obtained his pardon upon condition that he quitted  Tunbridge  immediately  But Mr  Nash  not only took care during his administration to protect the ladies from the insults of our sex but to guard them from the slanders of each other He in the first place prevented any animosities that might arise from place and precedence by being previously acquainted with the rank and quality of almost every family in the  British  dominions He endeavoured to render scandal odious by marking it as the result of envy and folly united Not even  Solon  could have enacted a wiser law in such a society as  Bath  The gay the heedless and the idle which mostly compose the groupe of waterdrinkers seldom are at the pains of talking upon universal topics which require comprehensive  thought or abstract reasoning The adventures of the little circle of their own acquaintance or of some names of quality and fashion make up their whole conversation But it is too likely that when we mention those we wish to depress them in order to render ourselves more conspicuous scandal must therefore have fixed her throne at  Bath  preferable to any other part of the kingdom However tho' these endeavours could not totally suppress this custom among the fair yet they gained him the friendship of several ladies of distinction who had smarted pretty severely under the lash of censure Among this number was the old duchess of  Marlborough  who conceived a particular friendship for him and which continued during her life She frequently consulted him in several concerns of a private nature Her letting leases building bridges or forming canals were often carried on under his guidance but she advised with him particularly in purchasing liveries for the footmen a business to which she thought his genius best adapted  As any thing relative to her may please the curiosity of such as delight in the anecdotes and letters of the great however dull and insipid I shall beg leave to present them with one or two of her letters collected at a venture from several others to the same purpose  To Mr  Nash  at the  Bath  Blenheim    Sept    MR  Jennens  will give you an account how little time I have in my power and that will make my excuse for not thanking you sooner for the favour of your letter and for the trouble you have given yourself in bespeaking the cloth which I am sure will be good since you have undertaken to order it Pray ask Mrs  Jennens  concerning the cascade which will satisfy all your doubts in that matter she saw it play which it will do in great beauty for at least six hours together and it runs enough to cover all the stones constantly and is a hundred feet broad which I am told is a much greater breadth than any cascade is in  England  and this will  be yet better than it is when it is quite finished this water is a great addition to this place and the lake being thirty acres out of which the cascade comes and falls into the canal that goes through the bridge it makes that look as if it was necessary which before seemed so otherwise  I am Your most humble Servant S MARLBOROUGH  To Mr  Nash  at the  Bath  Marlboroughhouse    May    SIR  I have received the favour of yours of the tenth of  May  with that from Mr  Harvey  And by last post I received a letter from Mr  Overton  a sort of a bailiff and a surveyor whom I have employed a great while upon the estates in  Wiltshire  He is a very active and very useful man of his sort He writes to me that Mr  Harvey  has been with him and brought him  a paper which I sent you He says that finding he was a man that was desirous to serve me he had assisted him all he could by informations which he has given and that he should continue to assist him I have writ to him that he did mighty well There is likewise a considerable tenant of my lord  Bruce  's his name is  Cannons  who has promised me his assistance towards recommending tenants for these farms And if Mr  Harvey  happens to know such a man he may put him in mind of it I am sure you will do me all the good you can And I hope you are sure that I shall always be sensible of the obligations I have to you and ever be  Your most thankful and obliged humble Servant S MARLBOROUGH  Mr  Harvey  may conclude to take any prices that were given you in the paper But as I know that we have been scandalously cheated if he finds that any thing can be let better than it has been let I do not doubt but he will do it  The duchess of  Marlborough  seems to not a much better writer than Mr  Nash  but she was worth many hundred thousands pounds and that might console her It may give splenetic philosophy however some scope for meditation when it considers what a parcel of stupid trifles the world is ready to admire  Whatever might have been Mr  Nash  's other excellencies there was one in which few exceeded him I mean his extensive humanity None felt pity more strongly and none made greater efforts to relieve distress If I were to name any reigning and fashionable virtue in the present age I th  should be charity The numberless benefactions privately given the various public solicitations for charity and the success they meet with serve to prove that tho' we may fall short of our ancestors in other respects yet in this instance we greatly excel them I know not whether it may not be spreading the influence of Mr  Nash  too widely to say that he was  one of the principal causes of introducing this noble emulation among the rich but certain it is no private man ever relieved the distresses of so many as he  Before gaming was suppressed and in the meridian of his life and fortune his benefactions were generally found to equal his other expences The money he got without pain he gave away without reluctance and whenever unable to relieve a wretch who sued for assistance he has been often seen to shed tears A gentleman of broken fortune one day standing behind his chair as he was playing a game of picquet for two hundred pounds and observing with what indifference he won the money could not avoid whispering these words to another who stood by  "heavens how happy would all that money make me"  Nash  overhearing him clapp'd the money into his hand and cried  go and be happy    About six and thirty years ago a clergyman brought his family to  Bath  for the benefit of the waters His wife laboured under a lingering disorder which it was thought nothing but the Hot Wells could remove The expences of living there soon lessened the poor man's finances his cloaths were sold piece by piece to provide a temporary relief for his little family and his appearance was at last so shabby that from the number of holes in his coat and stockings  Nash  gave him the name of doctor  Cullender  Our beau it seems was rude enough to make a jest of poverty tho' he had sensibility enough to relieve it The poor clergyman combated his distresses with fortitude and instead of attempting to solicit relief endeavoured to conceal them Upon a living of thirty pounds a year he endeavoured to maintain his wife and six children but all his resources at last failed him and nothing but famine was seen in the wretched family The poor man's circumstances were at last communicated to  Nash  who with his usual chearfulness undertook to relieve him On a sunday evening at a public teadrinking at  Harrison  's he went about to collect a subscription and began it himself by giving five guineas By this means two hundred guineas were collected in less than two hours and the poor family raised from the lowest despondence into affluence and felicity A bounty so unexpected had a better influence even upon the woman's constitution than all that either the physicians or the waters of  Bath  could produce and she recovered But his good offices did not rest here He prevailed upon a nobleman of his acquaintance to present the Doctor with a living of an hundred and sixty pounds a year which made that happiness he had before produced in some measure permanent  In the severe winter which happened in the year his charity was great useful and extensive He frequently at that season of calamity entered the houses of the poor whom he thought too proud to beg and generously relieved  them The colliers were at this time peculiarly distressed and in order to excite compassion a number of them yoaked themselves to a waggon loaded with coals and drew it into  Bath  and presented it to Mr  Nash  Their scheme had the proper effect Mr  Nash  procured them a subscription and gave ten guineas towards it himself The weavers also shared his bounty at that season They came begging in a body into  Bath  and he provided a plentiful dinner for their entertainment and gave each a week's subsistence at going away  There are few public charities to which he was not a subscriber and many he principally contributed to support Among others Mr  Annesly  that strange example of the mutability of fortune and the inefficacy of our Laws shared his interest and bounty I have now before me a well written letter addressed to Mr  Nash  in order to obtain his interest for that unhappy gentleman it comes from Mr  a quaker who was Mr  Annesly  's  father's agent This gentleman warmly espoused the young adventurer's interest and I am told fell with him  London    October    My Good Friend  WHEN I had the honour of conversing with thee at  Tunbridge  in  September  last concerning that most singular striking case of Mr  Annesley  whom I have known since he was about six years old I being then employed by the late Lord Baron of  Altham  his father as his agent From what I know of the affairs of that family I am well assured that Mr  Annesley  is the legitimate son of the late Lord Baron of  Altham  and in consequence thereof is intitled to the honours and estates of  Anglesey  Were I not well assured of his right to those honours and estates I would not give countenance to his claimI well remember that thou then madest me a promise to assist him in soliciting a subscription that was then begun at  Tunbridge  but as that place was not within the limits of thy province thou  couldest not promise to do much there But thou saidst that in case he would go to  Bath  in the season thou wouldest then and there shew how much thou wouldest be his friend  And now my good friend as the season is come on and Mr  Annesley  now at  Bath  I beg leave to remind thee of that promise and that thou wilt keep in full view the honour the everlasting honour that will naturally redound to thee from thy benevolence and crown all the good actions of thy lifeI say now in the vale of life to relieve a distressed young nobleman to extricate so immense an estate from the hands of oppression to do this will fix such a ray of glory on thy memory as will speak forth thy praise to future agesThis with great respect is the needful  from thy assured Friend WILLIAM HENDERSON  Be pleased to give my respects to Mr  Annesley  and his spouse  Mr  Nash  punctually kept his word with this gentleman he began the subscription himself with the utmost liberality and procured such a list of encouragers as at once did honour to Mr  Annesly  's cause and their own generosity What a pity it was that this money which was given for the relief of indigence only went to feed a set of reptiles who batten upon our weakness miseries and vice  It may not be known to the generality of my readers that the last act of the comedy called  Esop  which was added to the  French  plot of  Boursault  by Mr  Vanburgh  was taken from a story told of Mr  Nash  upon a similar occasion He had in the early part of life made proposals of marriage to miss  V  of  D  his affluence at that time and the favour which he was in with the nobility readily induced the young lady's father to favour his addresses However upon opening the affair to herself she candidly told him her affections were placed upon another  and that she could not possibly comply Tho' this answer satisfied Mr  Nash  it was by no means sufficient to appease the father and he peremptorily insisted upon her obedience Things were carried to the last extremity when Mr  Nash  undertook to settle the affair and desiring his favoured rival to be sent for with his own hand presented his mistress to him together with a fortune equal to what her father intended to give her Such an uncommon instance of generosity had an instant effect upon the severe parent he considered such disinterestedness as a just reproach to his own mercenary disposition and took his daughter once more into favour I wish for the dignity of history that the sequel could be concealed but the young lady ran away with her footman before half a year was expired and her husband died of grief  In general the benefactions of a generous man are but ill bestowed His heart seldom gives him leave to examine the real distress of the object which sues for pity  his goodnature takes the alarm too soon and he bestows his fortune on only apparent wretchedness The man naturally frugal on the other hand seldom relieves but when he does his reason and not his sensations generally find out the object Every instance of his bounty is therefore permanent and bears witness to his benevolence  Of all the immense sums which  Nash  lavished upon real or apparent wretchedness the effects after a few years seemed to disappear His money was generally given to support immediate want or to relieve improvident indolence and therefore it vanished in an hour Perhaps towards the close of life were he to look round on the thousands he had relieved he would find but few made happy or fixed by his bounty in a state of thriving industry it was enough for him that he gave to those that wanted he never considered that charity to some might impoverish himself without relieving them he seldom considered the merit or the industry  of the petitioner or he rather fancied that misery was an excuse for indolence and guilt It was an usual saying of his when he went to beg for any person in distress that they who could stoop to the meanness of solicitation must certainly  want  the favour for which they petitioned  In this manner therefore he gave away immense sums of his own and still greater which he procured from others His way was when any person was proposed to him as an object of charity to go round with his hat first among the nobility according to their rank and so on till he left scarce a single person unsolicited They who go thus about to beg for others generally find a pleasure in the task They consider in some measure every benefaction they procure as given by themselves and have at once the pleasure of being liberal without the self reproach of being profuse  But of all the instances of Mr  Nash  's bounty none does him more real honour  than the pains he took in establishing an hospital at  Bath  in which benefaction however Doctor  Oliver  had a great share This was one of those well guided charities dictated by reason and supported by prudence By this institution the diseased poor might recover health when incapable of receiving it in any other part of the kingdom As the disorders of the poor who could expect to find relief at  Bath  were mostly chronical the expence of maintaining them there was found more than their parishes thought proper to afford They therefore chose to support them in a continual state of infirmity by a small allowance at home rather than be at the charge of an expensive cure An hospital therefore at  Bath  it was thought would be an assylum and a place of relief to those disabled creatures and would at the same time give the physician more thorough insight into the efficacy of the waters from the regularity with which such patients would be obliged to take them These inducements therefore influenced Doctor  Oliver  and Mr  Nash  to promote a subscription  towards such a benefaction The design was set on foot so early as the year but not completed till the year This delay which seems surprizing was in fact owing to the want of a proper fund for carrying the work into execution What I said above of charity being the characteristic virtue of the present age will be more fully evinced by comparing the old and new subscriptions for this hospital These will shew the difference between ancient and modern benevolence When I run my eye over the list of those who subscribed in the year I find the subscription in general seldom rise above a guinea each person so that at that time with all their efforts they were unable to raise four hundred pounds but in about twenty years after each particular subscription was greatly encreased ten twenty thirty pounds being the most ordinary sums then subscribed and they soon raised above two thousand pounds for the purpose  Thus chiefly by the means of Doctor  Oliver  and Mr  Nash  but not without the assistance of the good Mr  Allen  who gave them the stone for building and other benefactions this hospital was erected and it is at present fitted up for the reception of one hundred and ten patients the cases mostly paralytic or leprous The following conditions are observed previous to admittance  "I The case of the patient must be described by some physician or person of skill in the neighbourhood of the place where the patient has resided for some time and this description together with a certificate of the poverty of the patient attested by some persons of credit must be sent in a letter postpaid directed to the register of the  General Hospital  at  Bath    II After the patient's case has been thus described and sent he must remain in his usual place or residence 'till he has notice of a vacancy signified by a letter from the register  III Upon the receipt of such a letter the patient must set forward for  Bath  bringing with him this letter the parish certificate duly executed and allowed by two justices and three pounds cautionmoney if from any part of  England  or  Wales  but if the patient comes from  Scotland  or  Ireland  then the cautionmoney to be deposited before admission is the sum of five pounds  IV Soldiers may instead of parish certificates bring a certificate from their commanding officers signifying to what corps they belong and that they shall be received into the same corps when discharged from the Hospital in whatever condition they are But it is necessary that their cases be described and sent previously and that they bring with them three pounds cautionmoney  Note  The intention of the cautionmoney is to defray the expences of returning the patients after they are discharged from  the Hospital or of their burial in case they die there The remainder of the cautionmoney after these expences are defrayed will be returned to the person who made the deposit"  I am unwilling to leave this subject of his benevolence because it is a virtue in his character which must stand almost single against an hundred follies and it deserves the more to be insisted on because it was large enough to outweigh them all A man may be an hypocrite safely in every other instance but in charity there are few who will buy the character of benevolence at the rate for which it must be acquired In short the sums he gave away were immense and in old age when at last grown too poor to give relief  he gave  as the poet has it  all he had a tear  when incapable of relieving the agonies of the wretched he attempted to relieve his own by a flood of sorrow  From the hospital erected for the benefit of the poor it is an easy transition to the  monuments erected by him in honour of the great Upon the recovery of the Prince of  Orange  by drinking the  Bath  waters Mr  Nash  caused a small obelisk thirty feet high to be erected in a grove near the Abbey church since called  Orange Grove  This Prince's arms adorn the west side of the body of the pedestal The inscription is on the opposite side in the following words  In memoriam  Sanitatis  Principi Auriaco  Aquarum th  malium potu  Favente Deo  Ovante Britannia  Feliciter restitutae  MDCCXXXIV  In English thus  In memory  Of the happy restoration  Of the health of the  Prince of  Orange    Through the favour of God  And to the great joy of Britain  By drinking the  Bath  waters    I find it a general custom at all Baths and Spaws to erect monuments of this kind to the memory of every Prince who has received benefit from the waters  Aix Spau  and  Pisa  abound with inscriptions of this nature apparently doing honour to the Prince but in reality celebrating the efficacy of their springs It is wrong therefore to call such monuments instances of gratitude tho' they may wear that appearance  In the year the Prince of  Wales  came to  Bath  who presented Mr  Nash  with a large gold enamelled snuffbox and upon his departure  Nash  as king of  Bath  erected an obelisk in honour of this Prince as he had before done for the Prince of  Orange  This handsome memorial in honour of that goodnatured Prince is erected in  Queen square  It is enclosed with a stone balustrade and in the middle of every side there are large iron gates In the center is the obelisk seventy feet high and terminating in a point The expences of this were eighty pounds and Mr  Nash  was determined that the inscription should answer the magnificence of the pile With this view he wrote to Mr  Pope  at  London  requesting an inscription I should have been glad to have given Mr  Nash  's letter upon this occasion the reader however must be satisfied with  Pope  's reply which is as follows  SIR  I have received yours and thank your partiality in my favour You say words cannot express the gratitude you feel for the favour of his R H and yet you would have me express what you feel and in a few words I own myself unequal to the task for even granting it possible to express an inexpressible idea I am the worst person you could have pitched upon for this purpose who have received so few favours from the great myself that I am utterly unacquainted with what kind of thanks they like best Whether the P most loves poetry or prose I protest I do not know but this I dare venture  to affirm that you can give him as much satisfaction in either as I can  I am SIR Your affectionate Servant A POPE  What Mr  Nash  's answer to this billet was I cannot take upon me to ascertain but it was probably a perseverance in his former request The following is the copy of Mr  Pope  's reply to his second letter  SIR  I had sooner answered yours but in the hope of procuring a properer hand than mine and then in consulting with some whose office about the P might make them the best judges what sort of inscription to set up Nothing can be plainer than the inclosed it is nearly the common sense of the thing and I do not know how to flourish upon it But this  you would do as well or better yourself and I dare say may mend the expression I am truly  Dear SIR  Your affectionate Servant A POPE  I think I need not tell you my name should not be mentioned  Such a letter as this was what might naturally be expected from Mr  Pope  Notwithstanding the seeming modesty towards the conclusion the vanity of an applauded writer bursts through every line of it The difficulty of concealing his hand from the clerks at the Postoffice and the solicitude to have his name concealed were marks of the consciousness of his own importance It is probable his hand was not so very well known nor his letters so eagerly opened by the clerks of the Office as he seems always to think But in all  his letters as well as those of  Swift  there runs a strain of pride as if the world talked of nothing but themseves  Alass  says he in one of them  the day after I am dead the sun will shine as bright as the day before and the world will be as merry as usual  Very strange that neither an eclipse nor an earthquake should follow the loss of a Poet  The inscription referred to in this letter was the same which was afterwards engraved on the obelisk and is as follows  In memory of honours bestow'd  And in gratitude for benefits conferred in this city  By his Royal Highness  Frederick  Prince of  Wales    And his Royal Consort  In the Year  This obelisk is erected by  Richard Nash    Esq  I dare venture to say there was scarce a commoncouncilman in the corporation of  Bath  but could have done this as well Nothing can be more frigid though the subject was worthy of the utmost exertions of Genius  About this period every season brought some new accession of honour to Mr  Nash  and the corporation now universally found that he was absolutely necessary for promoting the welfare of the city so that this year seems to have been the meridian of his glory About this time he arrived at such a pitch of authority that I really believe  Alexander  was not greater at  Persepolis  The countenance he received from the Prince of  Orange  the favour he was in with the Prince of  Wales  and the caresses of the nobility all conspired to lift him to the utmost pitch of vanity The exultation of a little mind upon being admitted to the familiarity of the Great is inexpressible The Prince of  Orange  had made him a a present of a very fine snuffbox Upon this some of the nobility thought it would be proper to give snuffboxes too  they were quickly imitated by the middling gentry and it soon became the fashion to give Mr  Nash  snuffboxes  To add to his honours the corporation of  Bath  placed a full length statue of him in the pumproom between the busts of  Newton  and  Pope  It was upon this occasion that the Earl of  Chesterfield  wrote that severe but witty epigram the last lines of which were so deservedly admired and ran thus  The statue placed the busts between  Adds to the satire strength  Wisdom  and  Wit  are little seen  But  Folly  at full length  The example of the corporation was followed by all his acquaintance of inferior rank He was treated in every respect like a great man he had his levee his flatterers his buffoons his goodnatured creatures and even his dedicators A trifling ill supported vanity was his foible and while he received the homage of the  vulgar and enjoyed the familiarity of the great he felt no pain for the unpromising view of poverty that lay before him he enjoyed the world as it went and drew upon content for the deficiencies of fortune If a cringing wretch called him his Honour he was pleased internally conscious that he had the justest pretensions to the title If a beggar called him my Lord he was happy and generally sent the flatterer off happy too I have known him in  London  wait a whole day at a window in the  Smyrna  coffeehouse in order to receive a bow from the Prince or the Dutchess of  Marlborough  as they passed by where he was standing and he would then look round upon the company for admiration and respect  But perhaps the reader desires to know who could be low enough to flatter a man who himself lived in some measure by dependance Hundreds are ready upon those occasions The very needy are almost ever flatterers A man in wretched circumstances forgets his own value and feels no  pain in giving up superiority to every claimant The very vain are ever flatterers as they find it necessary to make use of all their arts to keep company with such as are superior to themselves But particularly the prodigal are prone to adulation in order to open new supplies for their extravagance The poor the vain and the extravagant are chiefly addicted to this vice and such hung upon his good nature When these three characters are found united in one person the composition generally becomes a great man's favourite It was not difficult to collect such a groupe in a city that was the center of pleasure  Nash  had them of all sizes from the half pay captain in laced cloaths to the humble bootcatcher at the  Bear    I have before me a bundle of letters all addressed from a pack of flattering reptiles to his  Honour  and even some printed dedications in the same servile strain In these  his Honour  is complimented as the great encourager of the polite arts as a gentleman of the most accomplished  taste of the most extensive learning and in short of every thing in the world But perhaps it will be thought wrong in me to unveil the blushing muse to brand learning with the meanness of its professors or to expose scholars in a state of contemptFor the honour of letters the dedications to Mr  Nash  are not written by scholars or poets but by people of a different stamp  Among this number was the highwayman who was taken after attempting to rob and murder Doctor  Handcock  He was called  Poulter  alias  Baxter  and published a book exposing the tricks of gamblers thieves and pickpockets This he intended to have dedicated to Mr  Nash  but the generous patron tho' no man loved praise more was too modest to have it printed However he took care to preserve the manuscript among the rest of his papers The book was entitled  The discoveries of John Poulter alias Baxter who was apprehended for robbing Doctor Handcock of Salisbury on Clarken Down near Bath and  who has since been admitted king's evidence and discovered a most numerous gang of villains Being a full account of all the robberies he committed and the surprizing tricks and frauds he has practised for the space of five years last past in different parts of England particularly in the West Written wholly by himself  The dedication intended to be prefixed is as follows and will give a specimen of the stile of an highwayman and a gambler  To the Honourable  Richard Nash    Esq  May it please your Honour  WITH humblest submission I make bold to present the following sheets to your Honour's consideration and well known humanity As I am industriously careful in respect to his Majesty and good subjects to put an end to the unfortunate misconducts of all I know by bringing them to the gallows To be sure some may censure as if from selfpreservation I made this ample discovery but I communicate this to your Honour and gentry whether the life of one person  being taken away would answer the end as to let escape such a number of villains who has been the ruining of many a poor family for whom my soul is now much concerned If my inclinations was ever so roguish enclined what is it to so great a number of villains when they consult together As your Honour's wisdom humanity and interest are the friend of the virtuous I make bold to lay at your Honour's feet the following lines which will put every honest man upon his defence against the snares of the mischievous and am with greatest gratitude honoured Sir  Your Honour's Most truly devoted and obedient Servant John Poulter  alias  Baxter  Taunton Goal  June d  Flattery from such a wretch as this one would think but little pleasing however certain it is that  Nash  was pleased  with it he loved to be called your Honour and Honourable and the highwayman more than once experienced his generosity  But since I have mentioned this fellow's book I cannot repress an impulse to give an extract from it however foreign from my subject I take the following picture to be a perfectly humorous description of artful knavery affecting ignorance on one hand and rustic simplicity pretending to great wisdom and sagacity on the other It is an account of the manner in which countrymen are deceived by gamblers at a game called Pricking in the Belt or the Old Nob This is a leathern strop folded up double and then laid upon a table if the person who plays with a bodkin pricks into the loop of the belt he wins if otherwise he loses However by slipping one end of the strop the sharper can win at pleasure  "THERE are generally four persons concerned in this fraud one to personate a  Sailor  called a  Legg Cull  another  called the  Capper  who always keeps with the  Sailor  and two pickers up or  MoneyDroppers  to bring in  Flats  or  Bubbles  The first thing they do at a fair is to look for a room clear of company which the  Sailor  and  Capper  immediately take while the  MoneyDroppers  go out to look for a  Flat  If they see a countryman whose looks they like one drops a shilling or half a crown just before him and picking it up again looks the man in the face and says I have found a piece of money friend did you see me pick it up The man says yes Then says the sharper if you had found it I would have had half so I will do as I would be done unto come honest friend we will not part with dry lips Then taking him into the room where the other two are he cries By your leave gentlemen I hope we don't disturb the company No cries the  Sailor  no brothers Will you drink a glass of brandy I don't like your weak liquors and then begins a discourse by asking the  Capper  how far it is to  London  who replies I dont know perhaps the gentleman  there can tell you directing his discourse to the  Flat  perhaps the  Flat  will answer a hundred miles the  Sailor  cries I can ride that in a day ay in four or five hours for says he my horse will run twenty nots an hour for twentyfour hours together  Capper  or the  Sailor  's supposed companion says I believe  Farmer  you have not got such a horse as the  Sailor  has the  Farmer  cries No and laughs and then the  Sailor  says I must go and get half a pint of brandy for I am griped and so leaves them The  Capper  affecting a look of wisdom in his absence observes that it is an old saying and a true one  that Sailors get their money like horses and spend it like asses  as for that there  Sailor  I never saw him till now buying a horse of my man he tells me he has been at  Sea  and has got about four hundred pounds prizemoney but I belive he will squander it all away for he was gaming just now with a sharping fellow and lost forty shillings at a strange game of pricking in a string Did either of you ever see it gentlemen continued the  Capper  if you  two are willing I will ask him to shew it for we may as well win some of his money as any body else The  Flat  and the  Dropper  cry Do Then in comes the  Sailor  staggering as if drunk and cries What cheer brothers I have just seen a pretty girl in the fair and went in to drink with her we made a bargain and I gave her a six and thirty shilling piece but an old bh her mother came and called her away but I hope she will come back to me presently then the  Capper  laughs and says Have you got your money of her again The  Sailor  says No but she will come to me I'm sure then they all laugh This is done to deceive the  Flat  then says the  Capper  What have you done with the stick and the string  Sailor  he answers What that which I bought of the boys I have got it here but will not sell it and then he pulls out the Old Nobb saying What do you think I gave for it I gave but sixpence and as much brandy as the two boys could drink it is made out of a monkey's hide as the boys told me and they told me there is a game to be  played at it which no body can do twice together I will go down aboard ship and play with my Captain and I do not fear but I shall win his ship and cargo then they all laugh and the  Sailor  makes up the Old Nobb and the  Capper  lays a shilling and pricks himself and wins the  Sailor  cries You are a dab I will not lay with you but if you will call a stranger I will lay again why if you think me a dab as you call it I will get this strange gentleman or this pointing to the  Flat  Done cries the  Sailor  but you shall not tell him then he makes up the Nob and  Capper  lays a shilling  Flat  pricks being permitted to go sixpence to which he agreeing wins and  Capper  says to the  Flat  Can you change me half a crown This is done to find the depth of his pocket if they see a good deal of gold  Flat  must win three or four times if no gold but twice Sometimes if the  Flat  has no money the  Sailor  cries I have more money than any man in the fair and pulls out his purse of gold and saith Not one of you can beg borrow or steal half this  sum in an hour for a guinea  Capper  cries I have laid out all mine  Farmer  Can you I'll go your halves if you think you can do it The  Sailor  saith you must not bring any body with you then the  Dropper  goes with the  Flat  and saith you must not tell your friend it is for a wager if you do he will not lend it you  Flat  goes and borrows it and brings it to the  Sailor  shews it him and wins the wager then the  Sailor  pinches the Nob again and the  Capper  whispers to the  Flat  to prick out purposely this time saying it will make the  Sailor  more eager to lay on we may as well win his money as not for he will spend it upon whores  Flat  with all the wisdom in the world loses on purpose upon which the  Sailor  swears pulls out all his money throws it about the room and cries I know no man can win for ever and then lays a guinea but wi  l not let him prick but throws down five guineas and the  Capper  urging the  Flat  and going his halves the  Sailor  saith my cabbin boy will lay as much as that I'll lay no less than twenty guineas  the  Capper  cries lay  Farmer  and take up forty which being certain of winning he instantly complies with and loses the whole When he has lost in order to advise him the  Dropper  takes him by the arm and hauls him out of doors and the reckoning being in the mean time paid within the  Capper  and  Sailor  follow after and run another way When they are out of sight the  Dropper  faith to the  Flat  go you back and play with the  Sailor  for a shilling whilst I go and borrow money but when the  Flat  goes to the house he finds them gone and then he knows that he is bit but not till he has dearly paid for it"  By this fellow's discoveries Mr  Nash  was enabled to serve many of the nobility and gentry of his acquaintance he received a list of all those houses of ill fame which harboured or assisted rogues and took care to furnish travellers with proper precautions to avoid them It was odd enough to see a gamester thus employed in detecting the frauds of gamblers  Among the Dedications there is one from a Professor of Cookery which is more adulatory than the preceding It is prefixed to a work entituled  The complete preserver or a new method of preserving fruits flowers and other vegetables either with or without sugar vinegar or spirits  c  To the very Honourable  Richard Nash    Esq  Honoured SIR  AS much as the oak exceeds the bramble so much do you exceed the rest of mankind in benevolence charity and every other virtue that adorns enobles and refines the human species I have therefore made bold to prefix your name tho' without permission to the following work which stands in need of such a patron to excuse its errors with a candour only known to such an heart as your own the obligations I have received at your hands it is impossible for me ever to repay except by my endeavours as in the present case to make known the many excellent virtues which you possess But  what can my wit do to recommend such a genius as yours a single word a smile from yourself outweighs all that I or perhaps the best of our poets could express in writing in the compass of a year It would ill become my sex to declare what power you have over us but your generosity is even in this instance greater than your desire to oblige The following sheets were drawn up at my hours of leisure and may be serviceable to such of my sex as are more willing to employ their time in laudable occupations and domestic oeconomy than in dress and dissipation What reception they may receive from your honour I am incapable of telling However from your known candour and humanity I expect the most favourable  I am Honoured SIR Your most obedient and obliged humble Servant H W  A musician in his dedication still exceeds the other two in adulation However tho' the matter may be some impeachment on his sincerity the manner in which it is written reflects no disgrace upon his understanding  To  Richard Nash    Esq  SIR  THE kind partiality of my friends prevailed with me to present to the world these my first attempts in musical composition and the generous protection you have been pleased to afford me makes it my indispensable duty to lay them at your feet Indeed to whom could I presume to offer them but to the great encourager of all polite arts for your generosity knows no bounds nor are you more famed for that dignity of mind which enobles and gives a grace to every part of your conduct than for that humanity and beneficence which makes you the friend and benefactor of all mankind To you the poor and the rich the diseased and the  healthy the aged and the young owe every comfort every conveniency and every innocent amusement that the best heart the most skilful management and the most accomplished taste can furnish Even this age so deeply practised in all the subtleties of refined pleasure gives you this Testimony even this age so ardently engaged in all the ways of the most unbounded charity gives you this praise Pardon me then if amidst the croud of votaries I make my humble offering if I seize this first opportunity of publickly expressing the grateful sentiments of my own heart and profound respect with which  I am SIR Your most obliged most devoted and most obedient Servant J G  I fancy I have almost fatigued the reader and I am almost fatigued myself with the efforts of those elegant panegyrists however I can't finish this run of quotation  without giving a specimen of poetry addressed to him upon a certain occasion and all I shall say in its defence is that those who are pleased with the prose dedications will not dislike the present attempt in poetry  To  Richard Nash    Esq  On his sickness at  Tunbridge    SAY must the friend of human kind  Of most refin'dof most diffusive mind  Must  Nash  himself beneath these ailments grieve  He felt for allHe feltbut to relieve  To heal the sickthe wounded to restore  And bid desponding nature mourn no more  Thy quickning warmth O let thy patron feel  Improve thy springs with double power to heal  Quick hither all inspiring health repair  And save the gayand wretched from despair  Thou only Esra's drooping sons can'st chear  And stop the softey'd virgin's trickling tear  In murmurs who their monarch's pains deplore  While sickness faintsand pleasure is no more  O let not death with hasty strides advance  Thou mildest charity avert the lance  His threatning power coelestial maid defeat  Nor take him with thee to thy well known seat  Leave him on earth some longer date behind  To blessto polishand relieve mankind  Come then kind health O quickly come away  Bid  Nash  reviveand all the world be gay  Such addresses as these were daily offered to our titular King When in the meridian of power scarce a morning passed that did not encrease the number of his humble admirers and enlarge the sphere of his vanity  The man who is constantly served up with adulation must be a firstrate philosopher if he can listen without contracting new affectations The opinion we form of ourselves is generally measured by what we hear from others and when they conspire to deceive we too readily concur in the delusion Among the number of much applauded men in the circle of our own friends we can recollect but few that have heads quite strong enough to bear a loud acclamation of public praise in their favour  among the whole list we shall scarce find one that has not thus been made on some side of his character a coxcomb  When the best head turns and grows giddy with praise is it to be wondered that poor  Nash  should be driven by it almost into a phrenzy of affectation Towards the close of life he became affected He chiefly laboured to be thought a sayer of good things and by frequent attempts was now and then successful for he ever lay upon the lurch  There never perhaps was a more silly passion than this desire of having a man's jests recorded For this purpose it is necessary to keep ignorant or illbred company who are only fond of repeating such stories in the next place a person must tell his own jokes in order to make them more universal but what is worst of all scarce a joke of this kind succeeds but at the expence of a man's good nature and he who exchanges the character of being thought agreeable for that of being  thought witty makes but a very bad bargain  The success  Nash  sometimes met with led him on when late in life to mistake his true character He was really agreeable but he chose to be thought a wit He therefore indulged his inclination and never mattered how rude he was provided he was thought comical He thus got the applause he sought for but too often found enemies where he least expected to find them Of all the jests recorded of him I scarce find one that is not marked with petulance he said whatever came uppermost and in the number of his remarks it might naturally be expected that some were worth repeating he threw often and sometimes had a lucky cast  In a life of almost ninety years spent in the very point of public view it is not strange that five or six sprightly things of his have been collected particularly as he took every opportunity of repeating them himself His usual way when he thought  he said any thing clever was to strengthen it with an oath and to make up its want of sentiment by asseveration and grimace For many years he thus entertained the company at the coffeehouse with old stories in which he always made himself the principal character Strangers liked this well enough but they who were used to his conversation found it insupportable One story brought on another and each came in the same order that it had the day preceding But this custom may be rather ascribed to the peculiarity of age than a peculiarity of character it seldom happens that old men allure at least by novelty age that shrivels the body contracts the understanding instead of exploring new regions they rest satisfied in the old and walk round the circle of their former discoveries His manner of telling a story however was not displeasing but few of those he told are worth transcribing Indeed it is the manner which places the the whole difference between the wit of the vulgar and of those who assume the name of the polite one has in general as much  good sense as the other a story transcribed from the one will be as entertaining as that copied from the other but in conversation the manner will give charms even to stupidity The following is the story which he most frequently told and pretty much in these words Suppose the company to be talking of a  German  war or  Elizabeth Canning  he would begin thus  "I'll tell you something to that purpose that I fancy will make you laugh A covetous old parson as rich as the Devil scraped a fresh acquaintance with me several years ago at  Bath  I knew him when he and I were students at  Oxford  where we both studied damnationly hard but that's neither here nor there Well Very well I entertained him at my house in  John  's  Court  No my house in  John  's  Court  was not built then but I entertained him with all that the city could afford the rooms the music and every thing in the world Upon his leaving  Bath  he pressed me very hard to return the visit and desired me to let him  have the pleasure of seeing me at his house in  Devonshire  About six months after I happened to be in that neighbourhood and was resolved to see my old friend from whom I expected a very warm reception Well I knocks at his door when an old queer creature of a maid came to the door and denied him I suspected however that he was at home and going into the parlour what should I see but the Parson's legs up the chimney where he had thrust himself to avoid entertaining me This was very well My dear says I to the maid it is very cold extreme cold indeed and I am afraid I have got a touch of my ague light me the fire if you please La sir says the maid who was a modest creature to be sure the chimney smokes monstrously you could not bear the room for three minutes together By the greatest good luck there was a bundle of straw in the hearth and I called for a candle The candle came Well  good woman says I since you won't light me a fire I'll light one for myself and in a moment the straw was all in a blaze This quickly unkennelled the old fox there he stood in an old rusty night gown blessing himself and looking likeahemegad"  He used to tell surprizing stories of his activity when young  "Here I stand gentlemen that could once leap forty two feet upon level ground at three standing jumps backward or forward One two three dart like an arrow out of a bow But I am old now I remember I once leaped for three hundred guineas with Count  Klopstock  the great leaper leapingmaster to the Prince of  Passau  you must all have heard of him First he began with the running jump and a most damnable bounce it was that's certain Every body concluded that he had the match hollow when only taking off my hat stripping off neither coat shoes  nor stockings mind me I fetches a run and went beyond him one foot three inches and three quarters measured upon my soul by Captain  Pately  's own standard"  But in this torrent of insipidity there sometimes were found very severe satire strokes of true wit and lines of humour  cum fluerent lutulentus c  He rallied very successfully for he never felt another's joke and drove home his own without pity With his superiors he was familiar and blunt the inferiority of his station secured him from their resentment but the same bluntness which they laughed at was by his equals regarded as insolence Something like a familiar bootcatcher at an inn a gentleman would bear that joke from him for which a brother bootcatcher would knock him down  Among other stories of  Nash  's telling I remember one which I the more chearfully repeat as it tends to correct a piece of impertinence that reigns in almost  every country assembly The principal inhabitants of a markettown at a great distance from the capital in order to encourage that harmony which ought to subsist in society and to promote a mutual intercourse between the sexes so desirable to both and so necessary for all had established a monthly assembly in the Town Hall which was conducted with such decency decorum and politeness that it drew the attention of the gentlemen and ladies in the neighbourhood and a nobleman and his family continually honoured them with their presence This naturally drew others and in time the room was crouded with what the world calls good company and the assembly prospered till some of the new admitted ladies took it into their heads that the tradesmens daughters were unworthy of their notice and therefore refus'd to join hands with them in the dance This was complained of by the town ladies and that complaint was resented by the country gentlemen who more pert than wise publickly advertised that they would not  dance with tradesmens daughters This the most eminent tradesmen considered as an insult on themselves and being men of worth and able to live independently they in return advertised that they would give no credit out of their town and desired all others to discharge their accounts A general uneasiness ensued some writs were actually issued out and much distress would have happened had not my Lord who sided with no party kindly interfered and composed the difference The assembly however was ruined and the families I am told are not friends yet tho' this affair happened thirty years ago  Nothing debases human nature so much as pride  This  Nash  knew and endeavoured to stifle every emotion of it at  Bath  When he observed any ladies so extremely delicate and proud of a pedigree as to only touch the back of an inferior's hand in the dance he always called to order and desired them to leave the room or behave with common decency and when any Ladies and Gentlemen drew off after  they had gone down a dance without standing up till the dance was finished he made up to them and after asking whether they had done dancing told them they should dance no more unless they stood up for the rest and on these occasions he always was as good as his word  Nash  tho' no great wit had the art of sometimes saying rude things with decency and rendering them pleasing by an uncommon turnBut most of the good things attributed to him which have found their way into the jest books are no better than puns the smartest things I have seen are against him One day in the grove he joined some ladies and asking one of them who was crooked whence she came She replied strait from  London  Confound me madam said he then you must have been damnably warpt by the way  She soon however had ample revenge Sitting the following evening in one of the rooms he once more joined her company  and with a sneer and a bow asked her if she knew her Catechism and could tell the name of  Tobit  's dog His name Sir was  Nash  replied the lady and an impudent dog be was This story is told in a celebrated romance I only repeat it here to have an opportunity of observing that it actually happened  Queen  Anne  once asked him why he would not accept of knighthood To which he replied lest Sir  William Read  the mountebank who had been just knighted should call him brother  An house in  Bath  was said to be haunted by the Devil and a great noise was made about it when  Nash  going to the Minister of St  Michael  's intreated him to drive the Devil out of  Bath  for ever if it were only to oblige the ladies  Nash  used sometimes to visit the great Doctor  Clarke  The Doctor was one day conversing with  Locke  and two or three more of his learned and intimate companions  with that freedom gaiety and chearfulness which is ever the result of innocence In the midst of their mirth and laughter the Doctor looking from the window saw  Nash  's chariot stop at the door Boys boys cried the philosopher to his friends let us now be wise for here is a fool coming  Nash  was one day complaining in the following manner to the Earl of  Chesterfield  of his bad luck at play Would you think it my Lord that damned bitch fortune no later than last night tricked me out of Is it not surprizing continued he that my luck should never turn that I should thus eternally be mauled I don't wonder at your losing money  Nash  says his lordship but all the world is surprized where you get it to lose  Doctor  Cheney  once when  Nash  was ill drew up a prescription for him which was sent in accordingly The next day the Doctor coming to see his patient found him up and well upon which he asked  if he had followed his prescription Followed your prescription cried  Nash  NoEgad if I had I should have broke my neck for I flung it out of the two pair of stairs window  It would have been well had he confined himself to such sallies but as he grew old he grew insolent and seemed in some measure insensible of the pain his attempts to be a wit gave others Upon asking a lady to dance a minuet if she refused he would often demand if she had got bandy legs He would attempt to ridicule natural defects he forgot the deference due to birth and quality and mistook the manner of settling rank and precedence upon many occasions He now seemed no longer fashionable among the present race of gentry he grew peevish and fretful and they who only saw the remnant of a man severely returned that laughter upon him which he had once lavished upon others  Poor  Nash  was no longer the gay thoughtless idly industrious creature he once was he now forgot how to supply new modes of entertainment and became too rigid to wind with ease through the vicissitudes of fashion The evening of his life began to grow cloudy His fortune was gone and nothing but poverty lay in prospect To embitter his hopes he found himself abandoned by the great whom he had long endeavoured to serve and was obliged to fly to those of humbler stations for protection whom he once affected to despise He now began to want that charity which he had never refused to any and to find that a life of dissipation and gaiety is ever terminated by misery and regret  Even his place of master of the ceremonies if I can trust the papers he has left behind him was sought after I would willingly be tender of any living reputation but these papers accuse Mr  Quin  of endeavouring to supplant him He has  even left us a letter which he supposed was written by that gentleman soliciting a Lord for his interest upon the occasion As I chuse to give Mr  Quin  an opportunity of disproving this I will insert the letter and to shew the improbability of its being his with all its faults both of style and spelling I am the less apt to believe it written by Mr  Quin  as a gentleman who has mended  Shakespear  's plays so often would surely be capable of something more correct than the following It was sent as it should seem from Mr  Quin  to a nobleman but left open for the perusal of an intermediate friend It was this friend who sent a copy of it to Mr  Nash  who caused it to be instantly printed and left among his other papers  The letter from the intermediate friend to  Nash  is as follows  London    October    Dear  Nash    TWO posts ago I received a letter from  Quin  the old player covering one to my Lord which he left open for my perusal which after reading he desired I might seal up and deliver The request he makes is so extraordinary that it has induced me to send you the copy of his letter to my Lord which is as follows  Bath    October    My dear Lord  OLD beaux  Knash  has mead himselfe so dissagreeable to all the companey that comes here to  Bath  that the corperatian of this city have it now under thier

speke to Mr  Pitt  for to recommend me to the corperatian of this city to succede this old sinner as master of the cerremonies and yo will much oblige  My Lord  your Lord  s  and Hu  e  Ob  t  Ser  t    N B There were some other private matters and offers in  Quin  's letter to my Lord which do not relate to you  Here  Nash  if I may be permitted the use of a polite and fashionable phrase was humm'd but he experienced such rubs as these and a thousand other mortifications every day He found poverty now denied him the indulgence not only of his favourite follies but of his favourite virtues The poor now solicited him in vain he was himself a more pitiable object than they The child of the public seldom has a friend and he who once exercised his wit at the expence of others must naturally have enemies Exasperated at last to the highest degree an unaccountable whim struck him poor  Nash  was resolved to become an author he who in the vigour of manhood was incapable of the task now at the impotent age of eightysix was determined to write his own history from the many specimens already given of his style the reader will not much regret that the historian was interrupted in his design Yet as  Montaigne  observes as the adventures  of an infant if an infant could inform us of them would be pleasing so the life of a Beau if a beau could write would certainly serve to regale curiosity  Whether he really intended to put this design in execution or did it only to alarm the nobility I will not take upon me to determine but certain it is that his friends went about collecting subscriptions for the work and he received several encouragements from such as were willing to be politely charitable It was thought by many that this history would reveal the intrigues of a whole age that he had numberless secrets to disclose but they never considered that persons of public character like him were the most unlikely in the world to be made partakers of those secrets which people desired the public should not know In fact he had few secrets to discover and those he had are now buried with him in the grave  He was now past the power of giving or receiving pleasure for he was poor old and peevish yet still he was incapable of turning from his former manner of life to pursue happiness The old man endeavoured to practise the follies of the boy he spurred on his jaded passions after every trifle of the day tottering with age he would be ever an unwelcome guest in the assemblies of the youthful and gay and he seemed willing to find lost appetite among those scenes where he was once young  An old man thus striving after pleasure is indeed an object of pity but a man at once old and poor running on in this pursuit might excite astonishment To see a Being both by fortune and constitution rendered incapable of enjoyment still haunting those pleasures he was no longer to share in to see one of almost ninety settling the fashion of a lady's cap or assigning her place in a country dance to see him unmindful of his own reverend  figure or the respect he should have for himself toasting demireps or attempting to entertain the lewd and idle a sight like this might well serve as a satire on humanity might shew that man is the only preposterous creature alive who pursues the shadow of pleasure without temptation  But he was not permitted to run on thus without severe and repeated reproof The clergy sent him frequent calls to reformation but the asperity of their advice in general abated its intended effects they threatened him with fire and brimstone for what he had long been taught to consider as foibles and not vices so like a desperated debtor he did not care to settle an account that upon the first inspection he found himself utterly unable to pay Thus begins one of his monitors  "THIS admonition comes from your friend and one that has your interest deeply at heart It comes on a design altogether important and of no less consequence  than your everlasting happiness so that it may justly challenge your careful regard It is not to upbraid or reproach much less to triumph and insult over your misconduct or misery no 'tis pure benevolence it is disinterested goodwill prompts me to write I hope therefore I shall not raise your resentment Yet be the consequence what it will I cannot bear to see you walk in the paths that lead to death without warning you of the danger without sounding in your ear the lawful admonition  "Return and live Why do you such things I hear of your evil dealings by all this people"  I have long observed and pitied you and must tell you plainly Sir that your present behaviour is not the way to reconcile yourself to God You are so far from making atonement to offended justice that each moment you are aggravating the future account and heaping up an increase of his anger As long as you roll on in a continued circle of sensual delights and vain entertainments you are dead to all the purposes of piety and virtue You are as odious to  God as a corrupt carcase that lies putrefying in the churchyard You are as far from doing your duty or endeavouring after salvation or restoring yourself to the divine favour as a heap of dry bones nailed up in a coffin is from vigour and activityThink Sir I conjure you think upon this if you have any inclination to escape the fire that will never be quenched Would you be rescued from the fury and fierce anger of God Would you be delivered from weeping and wailing and incessant gnashing of teeth sure you would But be certain that this will never be done by amusements which at best are trifling and impertinent and for that if for no other reason foolish and sinful 'Tis by seriousness 'tis by retirement and mourning you must accomplish this great and desirable deliverance You must not appear at the head of every silly diversion you must enter into your closet and shut the door commune with your own heart and search out its defects The pride of life and all its superfluity of follies must be put away You must make haste and delay not to  keep every injunction of heaven You must always remember that mighty sinners must be mightily penitent or else mightily tormented Your example and your projects have been extremely  prejudicial  I wish I could not say  fatal  and  destructive  to many For this there is no amends but an alteration of your conduct as signal and remarkable as your  person  and  name  "  "If you do not by this method remedy in some degree the evils that you have sent abroad and prevent the mischievous consequences that may ensuewretched will you be wretched above all men to eternity The blood of souls will be laid to your charge God's jealousy like a consuming flame will smoke against you as you yourself will see in that day when the mountains shall quake and the hills melt and the earth be burnt up at his presence"  "Once more then I exhort you as a friend I beseech you as a brother I charge you as a messenger from God in his own most solemn words  "Cast away from you your  transgressions make you a new heart and a new spirit so iniquity shall not be your ruin"  "Perhaps you may be disposed to contemn this and its serious purport or to recommend it to your companions as a subject for railleryYet let me tell you beforehand that for this as well as for other things God will bring you to judgment He sees me now I write He will observe you while you read He notes down my words he will also note down your consequent procedure Not then upon me not upon me but upon your own soul will the neglecting or despising my sayings turn  "If thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear it"  Such repeated admonitions as these served to sting without reforming him they made him morose but not pious The dose was too strong for the patient to bear He should have been met with smiles and allured into reformation if indeed he was  criminal But in the name of piety what was there criminal in his conduct he had long been taught to consider his trifling profession as a very serious and important business He went through his office with great gravity solemnity and care why then denounce peculiar torments against a poor harmless creature who did a thousand good things and whose greatest vice was vanity He deserved ridicule indeed and he found it but scarce a single action of his life except one deserves the asperity of reproach  Thus we see a variety of causes concurred to embitter his departing life The weakness and infirmities of exhausted nature the admonitions of the grave who aggravated his follies into vices the ingratitude of his dependants who formerly flattered his fortunes but particularly the contempt of the great who quite forgot him in his wants all these hung upon his spirits and soured his temper and the poor man of pleasure might have terminated his life very tragically had not the corporation of  Bath  charitably resolved to grant him ten guineas the first  Monday  of every month This bounty served to keep him from actual necessity tho' far too trifling to enable him to support the character of a gentleman Habit and not nature makes almost all our wants and he who had been accustomed in the early parts of life to affluence and prodigality when reduced to an hundred and twentysix pounds a year must pine in actual indigence  In this variety of uneasiness his health began to fail He had received from nature a robust and happy constitution that was scarce even to be impaired by intemperance He even pretended among his friends that he never followed a single prescription in his life however in this he was one day detected on the parade for boasting there of his contempt and utter difuse of medicine unluckily the water of two blisters which Dr  Oliver  had prescribed and which he then had upon each leg ouzed through his stockings and betrayed him His aversion to physic however  was frequently a topic of raillery between him and Doctor  Cheney  who was a man of some wit and breeding When  Cheney  recommended his vegetable diet  Nash  would swear that his design was to send half the world grazing like  Nebuchadnezzar  Ay  Cheney  would reply  Nebuchadnezzar  was never such an infidel as thou art It was but last week gentlemen that I attended this fellow in a fit of sickness there I found him rolling up his eyes to heaven and crying for mercy he would then swallow my drugs like breastmilk yet you now hear him how the old dog blasphemes the faculty What  Cheney  said in jest was true he feared the approaches of death more than the generality of mankind and was generally very devout while it threatened him Tho' he was somewhat the libertine in action none believed or trembled more than he for a mind neither schooled by philosophy nor encouraged by conscious innocence is ever timid at the appearance of danger  For some time before his decease nature gave warning of his approaching dissolution The worn machine had run itself down to an utter impossibility of repair he saw that he must die and shuddered at the thought His virtues were not of the great but the amiable kind so that fortitude was not among the number Anxious timid his thoughts still hanging on a receding world he desired to enjoy a little longer that life the miseries of which he had experienced so long The poor unsuccessful gamester husbanded the wasting moments with an encreased desire tocontinue the game and to the last eagerly wished for one yet more happy throw He died at his house in St  John  's  court Bath  on the d of  February  aged eightyseven years three months and some days  This account of his age which contradicts that given us by Doctor  Oliver  was copied from Mr  Nash  's own handwriting by  George Scott    Esq  from a book in the possession of Mr  Charles Morgan  at his coffeehouse at  Bath    His death was sincerely regretted by the city to which he had been so long and so great a benefactor The day after he died the Mayor of  Bath  called the corporation together where they granted fifty pounds towards burying their Sovereign with proper respect After the corpse had lain four days it was conveyed to the abbey church in that city with a solemnity somewhat peculiar to his character About five the procession moved from his house the charity girls two and two preceded next the boys of the charity school singing a solemn occasional hymn  The HYMN sung at his Funeral  I  Most unhappy are we here  Full of sin and full of fear  Ever weary ne'er at rest  When O Lord shall we be blest  II  Earth's a clog a pageant life  Fill'd with folly guilt and strife  'Till we all unite in thee  With ourselves we disagree  III  What's our comfort here below  Empty bubble transient shew  Wrapt in the body's vile disguise  None truly is until he dies  IV  Here we dwell but not at home  To other worlds ordain'd to roam  Yet still we seek for joys that waste  Fleeting as the vernal blast  V  Lord remove these shadows hence  Give us faith instead of sense  Teach us here in life to die  That we may live eternally  Next marched the city  music and his own band sounding at proper intervals a dirge Three clergymen immediately preceded the coffin which was adorned with sable plumes and the pall supported by the six senior Aldermen The masters of the assemblyrooms followed as chief mourners the beadles of that hospital which he had contributed so largely to endow went next and last of all the poor patients themselves  the lame the emaciated and the feeble followed their old benefactor to his grave shedding unfeigned tears and lamenting themselves in him  The crowd was so great that not only the streets were filled but as one of the journals in a  Rant  expresses it  "even the tops of the houses were covered with spectators each thought the occasion affected themselves most as when a real King dies they asked each other  where shall we find such another  sorrow sate upon every face and even children lisped that their Sovereign was no more The awfulness of the solemnity made the deepest impression on the minds of the distressed inhabitants The peasant discontinued his toil the ox rested from the plough all nature seemed to sympathize with their loss and the muffled bells rung a peal of Bob Major"  Our deepest solemnities have something truly ridiculous in them there is somewhat ludicrous in the folly of historians who thus declaim upon the death of  Kings and Princes as if there was any thing dismal or any thing unusual in it  "For my part says Poggi the Florentine I can no more grieve for another's death than I could for my own I have ever regarded death as a very trifling affair nor can black staves long cloaks or mourning coaches in the least influence my spirits Let us live here as long and as merrily as we can and when we must die why let us die merrily too but die so as to be happy"  The few things he was possessed of were left to his relations A small library of well chosen books some trinkets and pictures were his only inheritance Among the latter were a gold box given by the late Countess of  Burlington  with Lady  Euston  's picture in the lid An agate etui with a diamond on the top by the Princess Dowager of  Wales  and some other things of no great value The rings watches and pictures which he formerly received from others would have come to a considerable amount but these his necessities had obliged him to dispose of Some  family pictures however remained which were sold by advertisement for five guineas each after Mr  Nash  's decease  It was natural to expect that the death of a person so long in the eye of the public must have produced a desire in several to delineate his character or deplore his loss He was scarce dead when the public papers were filled with elegies groans and characters and before he was buried there were epitaphs ready made to inscribe on his stone I remember one of those character writers and a very grave one too after observing alass that  Richard Nash    Esq  was no more went on to assure us that he was  sagacious debonair and comode  and concluded with gravely declaring  that impotent posterity would in vain fumble to produce his fellow  Another equally sorrowful gave us to know  that he was indeed a man  an assertion which I fancy none will be so hardy as to contradict But the merriest of all the lamentations made upon this occasion was that where he is called  A constellation of the heavenly sphere    One thing however is common almost with each of them and that is that  Venus Cupid  and the  Graces  are commanded to weep and that  Bath  shall never find such another  But tho' he was satirized with the praises of those yet there were some of real abilities who undertook to do justice to his character to praise him for his virtues and acknowledge his faults I need scarcely mention that Doctor  Oliver  and Doctor  King  are of this number They had honoured him with their friendship while living and undertook to honour his memory when dead As the reader may chuse to compare their efforts upon the same subject I have subjoined them and perhaps many will find in either enough upon so unimportant a subject as Mr  Nash  's life to satisfy curiosity The first published was that by Doctor  Oliver  written with much good sense and still more good nature But the reader will consider that he has assumed in his motto the character of  a panegyrist and spares his friend's faults tho' he was too candid entirely to pass them over in silence  A faint Sketch of the Life Character and Manners of the late Mr NASH  Imperium in Imperio  De mortuis nil nisi bonum  Bath    February    This morning died  RICHARD NASH  Esq  Aged eightyeight  He was by birth a gentleman an ancient  Briton    By education a student of  Jesus College  in  Oxford    By profession  His natural genius was too volatile for any  He tried the army and the law  But soon found his mind superior to both  He was  born to govern    Nor was his dominion like that of other legislators  Over the Servility of the vulgar  But over the pride of the noble and the Opulent  His public character was great  As it was selfbuilt and selfmaintained  His private amiable  As it was grateful beneficent and generous  By the force of genius  He erected the city of  Bath  into a province of pleasure  And became by universal consent  Its Legislator and ruler  He plan'd improv'd and regulated all the amusements of the place  His fundamental law was that of good breeding  Hold sacred decency and decorum  His constant maxim  Nobody howsoever exalted  By beauty blood titles or riches  Could be guilty of a breach of it unpunished  The penalty  his disapprobation  and  public shame    To maintain the sovereignty he had established  He published rules of behaviour  Which from their propriety acquired the Force of laws  And which the highest never infring'd without immediately undergoing the public censure  He  kept the men in order  most wisely  By prohibiting the wearing swords in his dominions  By which means  He prevented sudden passion from causing  The bitterness of unavailing repentance  In all quarrels he was chosen the Umpire  And so just were his decisions  That peace generally triumphed  Crowned with the mutual thanks of both parties  He  kept the ladies in goodhumour  most effectually  By a nice observance of the rules of place and precedence  By ordaining scandal to be the infallible mark  Of a foolish head and a malicious heart  Always rendering more suspicious  The reputation of her who propagated it  Than that of the person abused  Of the young the gay the heedless fair  Just launching into the dangerous sea of pleasure  He was ever unsolicited  sometimes unregarded    The kind protector  Humanely correcting even their mistakes in dress  As well as improprieties in conduct  Nay often warning them  Though at the hazard of his life  Against the artful snares of designing men  Or an improper acquaintance with women of doubtful characters  Thus did he establish his government on pillars  Of honour and politeness  Which could never be shaken  And maintained it for full half a century  With reputation honour and undisputed authority  Beloved respected and revered  Of his private character be it the first praise  That while by his conduct the highest ranks became his subjects  He himself became  The servant of the poor and the distressed  Whose cause he ever pleaded amongst the rich  And enforced with all the eloquence of a good example  They were ashamed not to relieve those wants  To which they saw him administer with  So noble an heart and so liberal an hand  Nor was his munificence confined to particulars  He being to all the publick charities of this city  A liberal benefactor  Not only by his own most generous subscriptions  But by always assuming in their behalf the character of  A sturdy beggar  Which he performed with such an authoritative address  To all ranks without distinction  That few of the worst hearts had courage to refuse  What their own inclinations would not have prompted them to bestow  Of a noble public spirit  And  A warm grateful heart  The obelisk in the grove  And  The beautiful needle in the square  Are magnificent testimonies  The One  Erected to preserve the memory of a  Most interesting event to his country  The restitution of health by the healing waters of this place  To the illustrious prince of Orange  Who came hither in a most languishing condition  The Other  A noble offering of thanks  To the late Prince of WALES and his royal Consort  For favours bestowed  And honours by them conferred on this city  His long and peaceful reign of  Absolute power  Was so tempered by his  Excessive goodnature  That no instance can be given either of his own cruelty  Or of his suffering that of others to escape  Its proper reward  Example unprecedented amongst absolute monarchs  READER  This  monarch  was a  man    And had his foibles and his faults  Which we would wish covered with the veil of goodnature  Made of the same piece with his own  But truth forceth us unwillingly to confess  His passions were strong  Which as they fired him to act strenuously in good  Hurried him to some excesses of evil  His fire not used to be kept under by an early restraint  Burst out too often into flaming acts  Without waiting for the cool approbation of his judgment  His generosity was so great  That prudence often whispered him in vain  That she feared it would enter the neighbouring confines of profusion  His charity so unbounded  That the severe might suspect it sometimes to be  The offspring of folly or ostentation  With all these  Be they foibles follies faults or frailties  It will be difficult to point out  Amongst his cotemporary Kings of the whole earth  More than ONE  Who hath fewer or less pernicious to mankind  His existence  For life it scarcely might be called  Was spun out to so great an age that  The  man  Was sunk like many former heroes in  The weakness and infirmities of exhausted nature  The unwilling tax all animals must pay  For multiplicity of days  Over his closingscene  Charity long spread her allcovering mantle  And dropped the curtain  Before the poor actor though he had played his part  Was permitted to quit the stage  Now may she protect his memory  Every friend of  Bath    Every lover of decency decorum and good breeding  Must sincerely deplore  The loss of so excellent a governor  And join in the most fervent wishes would I could say hopes  That there may soon be found a man  Able and worthy  To succeed him  The reader sees in what alluring colours Mr  Nash  's character is drawn but he must consider that an intimate friend held the pencil the Doctor professes to say nothing of the dead but what was good and such a maxim tho' it serves his departed  friend is but badly calculated to improve the living Dr  King  in his Epitaph however is still more indulgent he produces him as an example to kings and prefers his laws even to those of

parem  The following translation of this Epitaph will give the English reader an idea of its contents tho' not of its elegance  The Epitaph of  Richard Nash  Esq  Here lies  Richard Nash  Born in an obscure village  And from mean ancestors  To whom however  Strange to relate  Both the vulgar and the mighty  Without bribe or compulsion  Unanimously gave  A kingdom equally rich and flourishing  A kingdom which he governed  More than fifty years  With universal approbation and applause  To his empire also was added  By the consent of all orders  A celebrated province  Tunbridge  Which he ever swayed with great prudence  Not by delegated power but in person  He deigned to visit it every year  And while the necessities of state demanded his presence  He usually continued there  In such greatness of fortune  His pride discovered itself by no marks of dignity  Nor did he ever claim the honours of prostration  Despising at once titles of adulation  And laying aside all royal splendor  Wearing not even the diadem  He was content with being distinguish'd only by the ornamental ensign  Of a white hat  A symbol of the candour of his mind  He was a most prudent legislator  And more remarkable even than  Solon  or  Lycurgus    He at once established and authorized  Whatever laws were thought convenient  Which were equally serviceable to the city  And grateful to strangers  Who made it their abode  He was at once a provider and a judge of pleasures  But still conducted them with gravity and elegance  And repress'd licentiousness with severity  His chief care was employed  In preventing obscenity or impudence  From offending the modesty or the morals  Of the Fair Sex  And in banishing from their assemblies  Tumult clamour and abuse  He not only adorned this city which he loved  With beautiful structures  But improved it by his example  As no man knew no man taught what was  becoming  Better than he  He was just liberal kind and facetious  A friend to all but particularly to the poor  He had no enemies  Except some of the trifling great  Or dull declaimers foes to all mankind  Equally a lover of peace and of his country  He fix'd a happy and lasting concord  In his kingdom  So that none dare convey scandal or injure by open violence the universal peace  Or even by carrying arms appear prepar'd for war  With impunity  But tho' his power was boundless  Yet never did liberty flourish more which he promoted  Both by his authority and cultivated for his fame  He found out the happy secret  A thing not to be considered without surprize  Of uniting the vulgar and the great  The poor and the rich  The learn'd and ignorant  The cowardly and the brave  In the bonds of society an equal king to all  Whatever his faults were  For we all have faults  They were rather obnoxious to himself than others  They arose neither from imprudence nor mistake  Never from dishonesty or corrupt principle  But so harmless were they  That tho' they fail'd to create our esteem  Yet can they not want our pardon  Could other kings and governors  But learn to imitate his example  Would to heaven they could  Then might they see themselves happy  And their people still enjoying more true felicity  Ye muses and graces mourn  His death  Ye powers of love ye choirs of youth and virgins  But thou O  Bathonia  more than the rest  Cease not to weep  Your king your teacher patron friend  Never ah never to behold  His equal  Whatever might have been justly observed of Mr  Nash  's superiority as a governor at least it may be said that few contemporary kings have met with such able panegyrists The former enumerates all his good qualities with tenderness and the latter enforces them with impetuosity They both seem to have loved him and honourably paid his remains the last debt of friendship But a cool biographer unbiassed by resentment or regard will probably find nothing in the man either truly great or strongly vicious His virtues were all amiable and more adapted to procure friends than admirers they were more capable of raising love than esteem He was naturally endued with good sense but by having been long accustomed to pursue trifles his mind shrunk to the size of the little objects on which it was employed His generosity was boundless because his tenderness and his vanity were in equal proportion the one impelling him to relieve misery and the other to make his benefactions known In all his actions however  virtuous he was guided by sensation and not by reason so that the uppermost passion was ever sure to prevail His being constantly in company had made him an easy tho' not a polite companion He chose to be thought rather an odd fellow than a wellbred man perhaps that mixture of respect and ridicule with which his mock royalty was treated first inspired him with this resolution The foundations of his empire were laid in vicious compliance the continuance of his reign was supported by a virtuous impartiality In the beginning of his authority he in reality obeyed those whom he pretended to govern towards the end he attempted to extort a real obedience from his subjects and supported his right by prescription Like a monarch  Tacitus  talks of they complied with him at first because they loved they obeyed at last because they feared him He often led the rich into new follies in order to promote the happiness of the poor and served the one at the expence of the other Whatever his vices were they were of use to society  and this neither Petronius nor Apicius nor Tigellius nor any other professed voluptuary could say To set him up as some do for a pattern of imitation is wrong since all his virtues received a tincture from the neighbouring folly to denounce peculiar judgments against him is equally unjust as his faults raise rather our mirth than our detestation He was fitted for the station in which fortune placed him It required no great abilities to fill it and few of great abilities but would have disdained the employment He led a life of vanity and long mistook it for happiness Unfortunately he was taught at last to know that a man of pleasure leads the most unpleasant life in the world  A Letter from Mr  ***  in  Tunbridge  to Lord in  London  found among the Papers of Mr  Nash  and prepared by him for the press  MY LORD  WHAT I foresaw has arrived poor  Jenners  after losing all his fortune has shot himself through the head His losses to  Bland  were considerable and his playing soon after with  Spedding  contributed to hasten his ruin No man was ever more enamour'd of play or understood it less At whatever game he ventured his money he was most usually the dupe and still foolishly attributed to his bad luck those misfortunes that entirely proceeded from his want of judgment  After finding that he had brought on himself irreparable indigence and contempt his temper formerly so sprightly began to grow gloomy and unequal he grew more fond of solitude and more liable to  take offence at supposed injuries in short for a week before he shot himself his friends were of opinion that he meditated some such horrid design He was found in his chamber fallen on the floor the bullet having glanced on the bone and lodged behind his right eye  You remember my Lord what a charming fellow this deluded man was once How benevolent just temperate and every way virtuous the only faults of his mind arose from motives of humanity he was too easy credulous and goodnatured and unable to resist temptation when recommended by the voice of friendship These foibles the vicious and the needy soon perceived and what was at first a weakness they soon perverted into guilt he became a gamester and continued the infamous profession 'till he could support the miseries it brought with it no longer  I have often been not a little concerned to see the first introduction of a young man of fortune to the gamingtable With  what eagerness his company is courted by the whole fraternity of sharpers how they find out his most latent wishes in order to make way to his affections by gratifying them and continue to hang upon him with the meanest degree of condescension The youthful dupe no way suspecting imagines himself surrounded by friends and gentlemen and incapable of even suspecting that men of such seeming good sense and so genteel an appearance should deviate from the laws of honour walks into the snare nor is he undeceived till schooled by the severity of experience  As I suppose no man would be a gamester unless he hoped to win so I fancy it would be easy to reclaim him if he was once effectually convinced that by continuing to play he must certainly lose Permit me my Lord to attempt this task and to shew that no young gentleman by a year's run of play and in a mixed company can possibly be a gainer  Let me suppose in the first place that the chances on both sides are equal that there are no marked cards no pinching shuffling nor hiding let me suppose that the players also have no advantage of each other in point of judgment and still further let me grant that the party is only formed at home without going to the usual expensive places of resort frequented by gamesters Even with all these circumstances in the young gamester's favour it is evident he cannot be a gainer With equal players after a year's continuance of any particular game it will be found that whatever has been played for the winnings on either side are very inconsiderable and most commonly nothing at all Here then is a year's anxiety pain jarring and suspense and nothing gained were the parties to sit down and professedly play for nothing they would contemn the proposal they would call it trifling away time and one of the most insipid amusements in nature yet in fact how do equal players differ it is allowed that little or nothing can be gained but much is lost our youth our time those moments that may be laid  out in pleasure or improvement are foolishly squandered away in tossing cards fretting at ill luck or even with a run of luck in our favour fretting that our winnings are so small  I have now stated gaming in that point of view in which it is alone defensible as a commerce carried on with equal advantage and loss to either party and it appears that the loss is great and the advantage but small But let me suppose the players not to be equal but the superiority of judgment in our own favour A person who plays under this conviction however must give up all pretensions to the approbation of his own mind and is guilty of as much injustice as the thief who robbed a blind man because he knew he could not swear to his person  But in fact when I allowed the superiority of skill on the young beginner's side I only granted an impossibility Skill in gaming like skill in making a watch can only be acquired by long and painful industry The most sagacious youth alive  was never taught at once all the arts and all the niceties of gaming Every passion must be schooled by long habit into caution and phlegm the very countenance must be taught proper discipline and he who would practice this art with success must practice on his own constitution all the severities of a martyr without any expectation of the reward It is evident therefore every beginner must be a dupe and can only be expected to learn his trade by losses disappointments and dishonour  If a young gentleman therefore begins to game the commencements are sure to be to his disadvantage and all that he can promise himself is that the company he keeps tho' superior in skill are above taking advantage of his ignorance and unacquainted with any sinister arts to correct fortune But this however is but a poor hope at best and what is worse most frequently a false one In general I might almost have said always those who live by gaming are not beholding to chance alone for their support but take every advantage  which they can practise without danger of detection I know many are apt to say and I have once said so myself that after I have shuffled the cards it is not in the power of a sharper to pack them but at present I can confidently assure your Lordship that such reasoners are deceived I have seen men both in  Paris  the  Hague  and  London  who after three deals could give whatever hands they pleased to all the company However the usual way with sharpers is to correct fortune thus but once in a night and to play in other respects without blunder or mistake and a perseverance in this practice always balances the year in their favour  It is impossible to enumerate all the tricks and arts practised upon cards few but have seen those bungling poor fellows who go about at coffeehouses perform their clumsy feats and yet indifferently as they are versed in the trade they often deceive us when such as these are possessed of so much art what must not those be who have been bred up to gaming from  their infancy whose hands are not like those mentioned above rendered callous by labour who have continual practice in the trade of deceiving and where the eye of the spectator is less upon its guard  Let the young beginner only reflect by what a variety of methods it is possible to cheat him and perhaps it will check his confidence His antagonists may act by signs and confederacy and this he can never detect they may cut to a particular card after three or four hands have gone about either by having that card pinched or broader than the rest or by having an exceeding fine wire thrust between the folds of the paper and just peeping out at the edge Or the cards may be chalked with particular marks which none but the sharper can understand or a new pack may be slipped in at a proper opportunity I have known myself in  Paris  a fellow thus detected with a tin case containing two packs of cards concealed within his shirt sleeve and which by means of a spring threw the cards ready packed  into his hands These and an hundred other arts may be practised with impunity and escape detection  The great error lies in imagining every fellow with a laced coat to be a gentleman The address and transient behaviour of a man of breeding are easily acquired and none are better qualified than gamesters in this respect At first their complaisance civility and apparent honour is pleasing but upon examination few of them will be found to have their minds sufficiently stored with any of the more refined accomplishments which truly characterize the man of breeding This will commonly serve as a criterion to distinguish them tho' there are other marks which every young gentleman of fortune should be apprized of A sharper when he plays generally handles and deals the cards aukwardly like a bungler he advances his bets by degrees and keeps his antagonist in spirits by small advantages and alternate success at the beginning to shew all his force  at once would but fright the bird he intends to decoy he talks of honour and virtue and his being a gentleman and that he knows great men and mentions his coal mines and his estate in the country he is totally divested of that masculine confidence which is the attendant of real fortune he turns yields assents smiles as he hopes will be most pleasing to his destined prey he is afraid of meeting a shabby acquaintance particularly if in better company as he grows richer he wears finer cloaths and if ever he is seen in an undress it is most probable he is without money so that seeing a gamester growing finer each day is a certain symptom of his success  The young gentleman who plays with such men for considerable sums is sure to be undone and yet we seldom see even the rook himself make a fortune A life of gaming must necessarily be a life of extravagance parties of this kind are formed in houses where the whole profits are consumed and while those who play  mutually ruin each other they only who keep the house or the table acquire fortunes Thus gaming may readily ruin a fortune but has seldom been found to retrieve it The wealth which has been acquired with industry and hazard and preserved for ages by prudence and foresight is swept away on a sudden and when a besieging sharper sits down before an estate the property is often transferred in less time than the writings can be drawn to secure the possession The neglect of business and the extravagance of a mind which has been taught to covet precarious possession brings on premature destruction tho' poverty may fetch a compass and go somewhat about yet will it reach the gamester at last and tho' his ruin be slow yet it is certain  A thousand instances could be given of the fatal tendency of this passion which first impoverishes the mind and then perverts the understanding Permit me to mention one not caught from report or dressed up by fancy but such as has  actually fallen under my own observation and of the truth of which I beg your Lordship may rest satisfied  At  Tunbridge  in the year Mr  J Hedges  made a very brilliant appearance he had been married about two years to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune they had one child a boy on whom they bestowed all that affection which they could spare from each other He knew nothing of gaming nor seemed to have the least passion for play but he was unacquainted with his own heart he began by degrees to bett at the tables for trifling sums and his soul took fire at the prospect of immediate gain he was soon surrounded with sharpers who with calmness lay in ambush for his fortune and cooly took advantage of the precipitancy of his passions  His lady perceived the ruin of her family approaching but at first without being able to form any scheme to prevent it She advised with his brother who at  that time was possessed of a small fellowship in  Cambridge  It was easily seen that whatever passion took the lead in her husband's mind seemed to be there fixed unalterably it was determined therefore to let him pursue fortune but previously take measures to prevent the pursuits being fatal  Accordingly every night this gentleman was a constant attender at the hazard tables he understood neither the arts of sharpers nor even the allowed strokes of a connoisseur yet still he played The consequence is obvious he lost his estate his equipage his wife's jewels and every other moveable that could be parted with except a repeating watch His agony upon this occasion was inexpressible he was even mean enough to ask a gentleman who sate near to lend him a few pieces in order to turn his fortune but this prudent gamester who plainly saw there were no expectations of being repaid refused to lend a farthing alledging a former resolution against lending  Hedges  was at last  furious with the continuance of ill success and pulling out his watch asked if any person in company would set him sixty guineas upon it the company were silent he then demanded fifty still no answer he sunk to forty thirty twenty finding the company still without answering he cried out by  Gd  it shall never go for less and dashed it against the floor at the same time attempting to dash out his brains against the marble chimneypiece  This last act of desperation immedidiately excited the attention of the whole company they instantly gathered round and prevented the effects of his passion and after he again became cool he was permitted to return home with sullen discontent to his wife Upon his entering her apartment she received him with her usual tenderness and satisfaction while he answered her caresses with contempt and severity his disposition being quite altered with his misfortunes But my dear  Jemmy  says his wife perhaps you don't  know the news I have to tell  My Mamma's old uncle is dead the messenger is now in the house and you know his estate is settled upon you  This account seemed only to encrease his agony and looking angrily at her he cried there you lie my dear his estate it not settled upon me  "  I beg your pardon says she I really thought it was at least you have always told me so  "  No returned he as sure as you and I are to be miserable here and our children beggars hereafter I have sold the reversion of it this day and have lost every farthing I got for it at the hazard table  "What all"  replied the Lady Yes every farthing returned he and I owe a thousand pounds more than I have to pay Thus speaking he took a few frantic steps across the room When the Lady had a little enjoyed his perplexity  No my dear cried she you have lost but a trifle and you owe nothing our brother and I have taken care to prevent the effects of your rashness and are actually the persons who have won your fortune we employed proper persons for this purpose who brought their winnings to me your money  your equipage are in my possession and here I return them to you from whom they were unjustly taken I only ask permission to keep my jewels and to keep you my greatest jewel from such dangers for the future  Her prudence had the proper effect he ever after retained a sense of his former follies and never played for the smallest sums even for amusement  Not less than three persons in one day fell a sacrifice at  Bath  to this destructive passion Two gentlemen fought a duel in which one was killed and the other desperately wounded and a youth of great expectation and excellent disposition at the same time ended his own life by a pistol If there be any state that deserves pity it must be that of a gamester but the state of a dying gamester is of all situations the most deplorable  There is another argument which your lordship I fancy will not entirely despise beauty my lord I own is at best but a trifle but such as it is I fancy few would willingly  part with what little they have A man with an healthful complexion how great a philosopher soever he be would not willingly exchange it for a sallow hectic phyz pale eyes and a sharp wrinkled visage I entreat you only to examine the faces of all the noted gamblers round one of our public tables have you ever seen any thing more haggard pinched and miserable and it is but natural that it should be so The succession of passions flush the cheek with red and all such flushings are ever succeeded by consequent paleness so that a gamester contracts the sickly hue of a student while he is only acquiring the stupidity of a fool  Your good sense my lord I have often had an occasion of knowing yet how miserable it is to be in a set of company where the most sensible is ever the least skilful your footman with a little instruction would I dare venture to affirm make a better and more successful gamester than you want of passions and low cunning are the two great arts and it is peculiar  to this science alone that they who have the greatest passion for it are of all others the most unfit to practise it  Of all the men I ever knew  Spedding  was the greatest blockhead and yet the best gamester he saw almost intuitively the advantage on either side and ever took it he could calculate the odds in a moment and decide upon the merits of a cock or an horse better than any man in  England  in short he was such an adept in gaming that he brought it up to a pitch of sublimity it had never attained before yet with all this  Spedding  could not write his own name What he died worth I cannot tell but of this I am certain he might have possest a ministerial estate and that won from men famed for their sense literature and patriotism  If after this description your Lordship is yet resolved to hazard your fortune at gaming I beg you would avert to the situation of an old and luckless gamester Perhaps there is not in nature a more deplorable being his character is too well  marked he is too well known to be trusted A man that has been often a bankrupt and renewed trade upon low compositions may as well expect extensive credit as such a man His reputation is blasted his constitution worn by the extravagance and ill hours of his profession he is now incapable of alluring his dupes and like a superannuated savage of the forest he is starved for want of vigour to hunt after prey  Thus gaming is the source of poverty and still worse the parent of infamy and vice It is an inlet to debauchery for the money thus acquired is but little valued Every gamester is a rake and his morals worse than his mystery It is his interest to be exemplary in every scene of debauchery his prey is to be courted with every guilty pleasure but these are to be changed repeated and embellished in order to employ his imagination while his reason is kept asleep a young mind is apt to shrink at the prospect of ruin care must be taken to harden his courage and make  him keep his rank he must be either found a libertine or he must be made one And when a man has parted with his money like a fool he generally sends his conscience after it like a villain and the nearer he is to the brink of destruction the fonder does he grow of ruin  Your friend and mine my Lord had been thus driven to the last reserve he found it impossible to disentangle his affairs and look the world in the face impatience at length threw him into the abyss he feared and life became a burthen because he feared to die But I own that play is not always attended with such tragical circumstances some have had courage to survive their losses and go on content with beggary and sure those misfortunes which are of our own production are of all others most pungent To see such a poor disbanded being an unwelcome guest at every table and often flapped off like a fly is affecting in this case the closest alliance is forgotten and contempt is too strong for the ties of blood to unbind  But however fatal this passion may be in its consequence none allures so much in the beginning the person once listed as a gamester if not soon reclaimed pursues it strough his whole life no loss can retard no danger awaken him to common sense nothing can terminate his career but want of money to play or of honour to be trusted  Among the number of my acquaintance I knew but of two who succeeded by gaming the one a phlegmatic heavy man who would have made a fortune in whatever way of life he happened to be placed the other who had lost a fine estate in his youth by play and retrieved a greater at the age of sixty five when he might be justly said to be past the power of enjoying it One or two successful gamesters are thus set up in an age to allure the young beginner we all regard such as the highest prize in a lottery unmindful of the numerous losses that go to the accumulation of such infrequent success  Yet I would not be so morose as to refuse your youth all kinds of play the innocent amusements of a family must often be indulged and cards allowed to supply the intervals of more real pleasure but the sum played for in such cases should always be a trifle something to call up attention but not engage the passions The usual excuse for laying large sums is to make the players attend to their game but in fact he that plays only for shillings will mind his cards equally well with him that betts guineas for the mind habituated to stake large sums will consider them as trifles at last and if one shilling could not exclude indifference at first neither will an hundred in the end  I have often asked myself how it is possible that he who is possessed of competence can ever be induced to make it precarious by beginning play with the odds against him for wherever he goes to sport his money he will find himself over matched and cheated Either at  White  's  Newmarket  the  Tennis Court  the  Cock Pit  or the  Billiard Table  he will find numbers who have no other resource but their acquisitions there and if such men live like gentlemen he may readily conclude it must be on the spoils of his fortune or the fortunes of ill judging men like himself Was he to attend but a moment to their manner of betting at those places he would readily find the gamester seldom proposing betts but with the advantage in his own favour A man of honour continues to lay on the side on which he first won but gamesters shift change lie upon the lurch and take every advantage either of our ignorance or neglect  In short my Lord if a man designs to lay out his fortune in quest of pleasure the gaming table is of all other places that where he can have least for his money The company are superficial extravagant and unentertaining the conversation flat debauched and absurd the hours unnatural and fatiguing the anxiety of losing  is greater than the pleasure of winning friendship must be banished from that society the members of which are intent only on ruining each other every other improvement either in knowledge or virtue can scarce find room in that breast which is possessed by the spirit of play the spirits become vapid the constitution is enfeebled the complexion grows pale till in the end the mind body friends fortune and even the hopes of futurity sink together Happy if nature terminates the scene and neither justice nor suicide are called in to accelerate her tardy approach  I am my Lord c  Among other Papers in the custody of Mr  Nash  was the following angry Letter addressed to him in this manner  To  Richard Nash  Esq  King of  Bath  SIRE  I Must desire your Majesty to order the inclosed to be read to the great Mr  Hoyle  if he be found in any part of your dominions You will perceive that it is a panegyrick on his manifold virtues and that he is thanked more particularly for spending his time so much to the emolument of the public and for obliging the world with a book more read than the Bible and which so eminently tends to promote christian knowledge sound morality and the happiness of mankind    The inclosed we have omitted as it contains a satire on gaming and may probably give offence to our betters    This author however continues the letter writer has not set forth half the merits of the piece under consideration nor is the great care which he has taken to prevent our reading any other book instead of this been sufficiently taken notice of  beware of counterfeits these books are not to be depended on unless signed by  E Hoyle is a charitable admonition As you have so much power at  Bath  and are absolute I think you should imitate other great monarchs by rewarding those with honours who have been serviceable in your state and I beg that a new order may be established for that purpose Let him who has done nothing but game all his life and has reduced the most families to ruin and beggary be made a  Marshal of the Black Ace  and those who are every day making proselytes to the tables have the honour of knighthood conferred on them and be distinguished by the style and title of  Knights of the four Knaves    The moment I came into  Bath  my ears were saluted with the news of a gentleman's being plundered at the gaming table and having lost his senses on the occasion The same day a duel was fought between two gentlemen gamesters on the Downs and in the evening another hanged himself at the  Bear  but first wrote a note which was found near him importing that he had injured the best of friends These are the atchievements of your  Knights of the four Knaves  The Devil will pick the bones of all gamesters that's certainAy and of duellers too but in the mean time let none think that duelling is a mark of courage for I know it is not A person served under me in  Flanders  who had fought four duels and depended so much on his skill the strength of his arm and the length of his sword that he would take up a Quarrel for any body yet in the field I never saw one behave so like a poltroon If a few of these gamesters and duellers were gibbeted it might perhaps help to amend the rest I have often  thought that the only way or at least the most effectual way to prevent duelling would be to hang both parties the living and the dead on the same tree  A scheme to prevent duelling similar to this was attempted by  Gustavus Adolphus  and is thus recorded by the writer of his life  "In one of the  Prussian  Campaigns when the irrational practice of duelling arose to a considerable height in the  Swedish  army not only amongst persons of rank and fashion but even amongst common soldiers This prince published a severe edict and denounced death against every delinquent Soon after a quarrel arose between two officers of very high command and as they knew the king's firmness in preserving his word inviolable they agreed to request an audience and besought his permission to decide the affair like men of honour His Majesty took fire in a moment but repressed his passion with such art that they easily mistook him of course with some reluctance but under the appearance of pitying brave men who thought their reputation injured he told them that he blamed them much for their mistaken notions concerning Fame and Glory yet as this unreasonable determination appeared to be the result of deliberate reflection to the best of their deluded capacity he would allow them to decide the affair at the time and place specified and gentlemen said he I will be an eye witness myself of your extraordinary valour and prowess"  At the hour appointed  Gustavus  arrived accompanied by a small body of infantry whom he formed into a circle round the combatants  "Now says he fight till one man dies"  and calling the executioner of the army to him or the provostmarshal as the language then ran  "Friend added he the instant one is killed behead the other before my eyes"  Astonished with such inflexible firmness the two generals after pausing a moment fell down on their knees and asked the king's forgiveness who made them embrace each other and give their promise to continue faithful friends to their last moments as they did with sincerity and thankfulness  and if  the winner and the loser were treated in the same manner it would be better for the publick since the tucking up of a few Rls might be a warning to others and save many a worthy family from destruction  I am yours c  The author of this letter appears to have been very angry and not without reason for if I am rightly informed his only son was ruined at  Bath  and by sharpers  But why is  Nash  to be blamed for this It must be acknowledged that he always took pains to prevent the ruin of the youth of both sexes and had so guarded against duelling that he would not permit a sword to be worn in  Bath    As the heart of a man is better known by his private than public actions let us take a view of  Nash  in domestick life among his servants and dependants where no gloss was required to colour his sentiments and disposition nor any mask necessary to conceal his foibles Here we shall find him the same openhearted generous goodnatured man we have already described one who was ever fond of promoting the interests of his friends his servants and dependants and making them happy In his own house no man perhaps was more regular chearful and beneficent than Mr  Nash  His table was always free to those who sought his friendship or wanted a dinner and after grace was said he usually accosted the company in the following extraordinary manner to  take off all restraint and ceremony  "Come gentlemen eat and welcome spare and the Devil choak you"  I mention this circumstance for no other reason but because it is well known and is consistent with the singularity of his character and behaviour  As Mr  Nash  's thoughts were entirely employed in the affairs of his government he was seldom at home but at the time of eating or of rest His table was well served but his entertainment consisted principally of plain dishes Boiled chicken and roast mutton were his favourite meats and he was so fond of the small sort of potatoes that he called them  English  pineapples and generally eat them as others do fruit after dinner In drinking he was altogether as regular and abstemious Both in this and in eating he seemed to consult nature and obey only her dictates Good small beer with or without a glass of wine in it and sometimes wine and water was his drink at meals and after dinner he generally drank one glass of wine He  seemed fond of hot suppers usually supped about nine or ten o'clock upon roast breast of mutton and his potatoes and soon after supper went to bed which induced Dr  Cheney  to tell him jestingly  that he behaved like other brutes and lay down as soon as he had filled his belly Very true  replied Nash  and this prescription I had from my neighbour's Cow who is a better physician than you and a superior judge of plants notwithstanding you have written so learnedly on the vegetable diet    Nash  generally arose early in the morning being seldom in bed after five and to avoid disturbing the family and depriving his servants of their rest he had the fire laid after he was in bed and in the morning lighted it himself and sat down to read some of his few but well chosen books After reading some time he usually went to the pumproom and drank the waters then took a walk on the parade and went to the coffeehouse to breakfast after which till two o'clock his usual time of dinner his hours were spent in arbitrating  differences amongst his neighbours or the company resorting to the wells directing the diversions of the day in visiting the new comers or receiving friends at his own house of which there were a great concourse till within six or eight years before his death  His generosity and charity in private life tho' not so conspicuous was as great as that in publick and indeed far more considerable than his little income would admit of He could not stifle the natural impulse which he had to do good but frequently borrowed money to relieve the distressed and when he knew not conveniently where to borrow he has been often observed to shed tears as he passed through the wretched supplicants who attended his gate  This sensibility this power of feeling the misfortunes of the miserable and his address and earnestness in relieving their wants exalts the character of Mr  Nash  and draws an impenetrable veil over his  foibles His singularities are forgotten when we behold his virtues and he who laughed at the whimsical character and behaviour of this Monarch of  Bath  now laments that he is no more  FINIS  ERRATA  Page Line from the top for  pumproom  read  Wiltshire's

Writing not only from the Pleasure it affords the Imagination but from the Instruction it artfully and unexpectedly conveys to the Understanding It furnishes us with an Opportunity of giving Advice freely and without Offence It not only removes the Dryness and dogmatical Air of Precept but sets Persons Actions and their Consequences before us in the most striking Manner and by that Means turns even Precept into Example Whence arises the Propriety of placing these Volumes in the Hands of Youth  A Gentleman of uncommon Understanding being asked what was the best Lesson for Youth answered  The Life of a good Man  And being asked what was the next best replied  The Life of a bad one  For that the first would make him in love with Virtue and teach him how to conduct himself through Life so as to become an Ornament to Society and a Blessing to his Family and Friends and the last would point out the hateful Consequences of Vice and make him careful to avoid those Actions himself which appeared so detestable in others  "What Histories can be found says the Marquis  De Montesquieu  that please and instruct like the Lives of  Plutarch  He paints the Man whose Life he relates he makes him known such as he was at the Head of the Armies in the  Government of the People in his own Family and in his Pleasures In short I am of the same Opinion with that Author who said that if he was constrained to fling all the Books of the Antients into the Sea PLUTARCH  should be the last drowned  "  In the Course of this Work all those Actions which are usually called Great and Glorious but
