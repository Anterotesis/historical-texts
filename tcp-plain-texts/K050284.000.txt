 LIBERTY  SLAVERY  DIALOGUE BETWIXT  WHIG  and  TORY    herein the Principles and Practices of each Party are fairly and impartially stated that thereby Mistakes and Prejudices may be remov'd from amongst us and all who prefer  English  Liberty and the Protestant Religion to  French  Slavery and Popery may be inform'd how to chuse fit and proper Instruments for our Preservation in these Times of Danger  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following Discourse was first printed  the Year but as the same Causes w  always produce the same Effects 'tis thought n  unseasonable to publish it now afresh and if th  who have any regard to the Happiness of the Native Country of whatever Party they be w  peruse it with Minds free from Heat and Prejudic  the Publisher will attain his chiefest aim  To the KING  SIR  THO the sacred Majesty of Kings I am sensible ought not in common cases to be approach'd by every little Busybody or frivolous Remonstrancemaker yet when our Prince's Palace is  Fire and his sacred Person in the midst of the Flames  e meanest of his Subjects hath the Privilege then to  ve him warning of his Danger and to assist to quench  e Fire And this I am afraid Sir is at present too near  r Case or I would not have assum'd the Boldness to  sturb your Repose or have plac'd my self so disadvanta  eously before your Majesty as I must expect to appear  nder the Character of a publick Censor of the Manners  your Ministers and a petty StateReformer But it is  ot I alone that am thus concern'd and busy for the Pub  ck the whole World are at this time mournfully reflec  ing upon the miserable Estate we are fallen into from  hat happy and glorious Prospect of things which we had  and This has put all Men upon Enquiry  to the Causes of the unhappy Change of our Affairs  nd I find it agreed on all hands that the principal Occasion  f our Misfortunes or rather Mismanagements is from  he intrusting those with the Government of all who  ere the Creatures and Tools of the two last Reigns and  re irreconcilable Enemies to your Majesty's Government  hose who oppos'd your coming to the Crown those who  eclar'd to your Face King  James  the only Rightful King  hose who sold their Country and betray'd it to the two  ast Kings and will be always ready to sell it even to the  French  King if he prove the fairest Chapman  I have heard that  Thurloe  who was Secretary of Sta  to  Cromwell  being ask'd by King  Charles  II how they d  support their Government so long when all the Nobilit  Gentry and Clergy were against it he reply'd  By intrusti  those only in the Management of all Affairs who were as hearti  against that Nobility Gentry and Clergy  I do not apply th  literally for God be prais'd your Majesty has a great pa  of all these several Degrees of Men who are most hearti  and zealously in your Interests But I mean by this that yo  are to oppose your Enemies with their Enemies not wit  their Friends and that the Design of keeping out Kin  James  with Jacobites seems to be as impracticable as h  Project prov'd of setting up Popery with a Protestan  Army  Yet there are some about your Majesty who for ba  and private Ends endeavour to possess you with the de+structive Politicks of courting and buying your Enemie  into your Service and would persuade you that Kin  James  's Tories are the only Party truly principl'd for Mo+narchy and are fittest for Employment as being lon  practis'd in Business And that on the contrary you  Majesty's best Friends whom they call Whigs are not onl  ignorant and unacquainted with Publick Business but ar  Haters of Monarchy of Commonwealth Principles an  at best for making their Kings no more than Dukes  Venice  and Kings of Clouts Now this is a Notion so false so fatal to the Prosperity of your Affairs and so dangerous to the very Being of your Government that  cannot but think it highly necessary that this matter should be fairly stated and laid before your Majesty I am sensible how unfit I am for the Task and how open I lie to a Charge of Presumption in attempting it But as the Son of  Cyrus  who was from his Birth dumb broke Silence when he saw his Father in the Hands of his Murderers so since I saw no other Champion appear in this Cause I resolv'd to break thro all Impediments even those of Nature and to endeavour the Rescue of my King out of the Hands of those who have already been the Ruin of two Kings your Majesty's Predecessors and who will undoubtedly bring you and your Affairs into great Difficulties if you be not deliver'd from their Counsels  In order to this I have impartially made a Collection in the following Dialogue of all the Arguments which Whigs imploy against the Tories or Tories against the Whigs and submit it to your Majesty's discerning Judgment and most piercing and distinguishing Wisdom upon the whole which of them are most proper for your Majesty to employ those who were in the Interest of Popery  d of  France  or those who oppos'd both to the Death  appeal to you Sir whether a Tory's being for the Di  ne Right of Succession and consequently for King  James  's Monarchy makes him the fitter in Principle to be employ'd  y King  William  Or whether his boasted Skill in Busi  ess will be of any use to your Majesty if he be in Prin  ple and Inclination for King  James  and believes King  illiam  a King  de facto  only without a Rightful Title  nd in plain  English  an Usurper If these Gentlemen  as their Principles will naturally lead them to do use all  heir Skill in their several Stations to obstruct and make  ifficult your Affairs to betray your Designs to your Enemies to countenance and protect King  James  's Friends in  ll their Plots and Contrivances furnish them with In  elligence help them to Passes Escapes  c  all which things it cannot be deny'd have been and are daily done by some Persons employ'd in this Government Of what Use Sir or Service then is this boasted Skill in Business to your Majesty's Interests Certainly Men less conversant in Publick Affairs who have a Zeal for your Government would be of more Use and Service to you Men who were persecuted by King  Charles  and King  James  either in their own Persons or in the Persons of their Friends who were fin'd imprison'd and some of their Relations hang'd in those Reigns are more likely to act in earnest against King  James  and in the supporting your Majesty and your Government than those who had their Fortunes and their Families rais'd by King  James  and his Brother King  Charles  and who hope to be rais'd yet more by his Return or at least to secure in his Government what they have got in this by obliging him and his Friends at the Price of sacrificing you and your's  For Example Is it reasonable to believe the E of  N  whose Father and Family was rais'd by King  Charles  and King  James  for prostituting the Law and his nauseous Rhetorick to the Designs of those two Brothers who himself was a PrivyCounsellor with Father  Peters  and chosen by King  James  at the time of the Revolution to treat with your Majesty at  Hungerford  in order to delay your Progress to  London  and lastly who so violently oppos'd your Majesty's being crown'd King as to lay an eternal Obligation upon King  James  by it I say Sir is it reasonable to believe this Gentleman so proper a Secretary of State to your Majesty as the E of  S  who has so mortally disoblig'd King  James  in being so early and so zealous in your Interests who went at the Head of that Message to King  James  wherein he was requir'd to retire from  Whitehall  who has since that been so instrumental to place and  preserve the Crown upon your Head and has in a word broken all Measures so with King  James  as to leave no possibility of a Reconciliation to him and consequently has no Retreat from this Government but is oblig'd in common Sense to serve your Majesty faithfully and zealously  Or can your Majesty think Mr  K  who it is generally said believes himself the Son of King  J  and it is known by all the World owes his Fortune to him who if we may believe Report at the time of the Revolution agreed with Captain  Tosyer  to carry the Ships he then commanded in the  Straits  to King  James  in  France  had not the common Sailors very rudely oppos'd the Project who after this acquitted himself so ill at  Cadiz  in letting the  Thoulon  Squadron pass by him in his sight without fighting them and to conclude has made so unaccountable a Campagn of it this Summer Can your Majesty give me leave to say Sir think this Gentleman after all this fitter to command the Fleet of  England  than Mr  R  whose Provocations to King  James  are never to be forgiven by him who was one of the most instrumental Men in  England  in placing you upon the Throne who last Year gave you the greatest and most glorious Victory that ever was obtain'd by us at Sea and whose Courage Conduct and Fidelity the Parliament of  England  has unanimously attested  And now Sir if I may presume so far will your Majesty be pleas'd to examine what Honour what Profit has accru'd to you or the Nation by your employing these Gentlemen who have of late been at the Head of the Ministry For God's sake Sir cast up the Account of the last four Years Management and see what you have gain'd by changing Whigs for Torys Have not your Affairs gone backward both at home and abroad Have not Mismanagements been multiply'd Have you not cool'd your Friends and yet not gain'd your Enemies Do not almost all the Tories you employ drink King  James  's Health in your Wine and serve him in your Offices Do they not obstruct all Business which ought to be dispatch'd and dispatch all Business which ought to be obstructed browbeat your Friends and delay them in the most just Pretences but comply with your Enemies in their most unreasonable Demands nay connive at their Cabals and Conspiracies and snatch them out of the Hands of Justice when the Law has sentenc'd them to Death for their Treasons Would not such Ministers and Friends as these be less dangerous to you when profess'd Enemies nay in Arms against you in the Field than in your Council Cabinet and Offices Undoubtedly they would  But I know the common Answer to all these kind of Complaints is That it is more easy to find Faults than Remedies If you please therefore Sir we will consider of Remedys and I think there may be some found out both easy and certain and they are these First Sir be pleas'd to remove from your Person Council and Offices of Trust Men bred up and confirm'd in Principles destructive to our  English  Government and hateful to your People and to discountenance all StateProjecters and MountebankMinisters who make Wounds in the State to recommend their Balsam Throw out Sir these  Achans  to be ston'd by the People who will otherwise I fear prevent God's Favour to you who blast your Success abroad and rob you of the Affections of your Subjects at home with their accursed thing I mean that Tinsel Power with which these Miscreants dazle the Eyes of Princes and lead them out of the right way God is displeas'd with it For uncontroulable and unaccountable Power is the Right and Attribute of God alone and as the Scripture tells us  He will not give his Glory unto another nor suffer those to act like Gods who are to die like Men  Your People also will be displeas'd with a Despotick Power for the Kings of  England  are bound by Laws by mutual Compacts  c  as you your self Sir have set forth most unanswerably in your Declaration when you came over and if these are broken  Englishmen  who believe themselves Subjects to the Crown of  England  as by Law establish'd and not Slaves to any particular Person  Otherwise King  James  would have a fairer Pretence than I hope we shall ever allow him  they become impatient angry and at length perhaps unreasonable And whenever they see their King beset with Ministers of Lawless Principles those wholesale Merchants of Arbitrary Power they grow mistrustful and uneasy and are apt in such Cases to shut their Purses and open their Mouths And give me leave to say Sir had not the People been made apprehensive and jealous by seeing these Men in the Ministry whose mischievous Methods they were so well acquainted with and did so much abhor no general Excise no Loans no Powers would have been thought by the People of  England  too much to have intrusted you with so highly they esteem'd your generous Relief of them your unequal Courage and the many other admirable Vertues they saw shine in you An  English  King is the greatest Monarch upon Earth when he reigns in the Hearts of his Subjects and all other Methods to Power and Greatness have been found ineffectual in  England  I remember I once saw  written over a Mercer's Shop  Keep thy Shop and thy Sh  will keep thee  and tho it be a homely Allusion it is very applicable to the present Point  Keep your Laws Sir a  your Laws will keep you  support your People in their Right and Liberties and Queen  Elizabeth  shall pass her Royal Word for them they will support your just Prerogative a  home and your Honour abroad And Sir by the way do not let your Flatterers give you a cheap Opinion of  Power deriv'd from the People for it is undoubtedly from their Consent that all Power must come Nor let them make you uneasy that your Title to the Crown is from the universal free Choice of the Commons of  England  Be+lieve me your Ministers nor the two learned Bishops who have scribled upon this Subject will ever be able to find you a better  In the next place discharge all Jacobites and Trimmer from Offices of Trust For such as either desire King  James  or from their Fear or Wisdom endeavour to deserve from him so much as their Pardon I humbly conceive are unfit for your Service at this Juncture tho when the Government is more settl'd I am for entertaining all who give Proofs of their Penitence for their past Actions and Opinions  But Sir Purgatives will not alone perfect the Cure of your Government and restore it to perfect Health you must make use of Alteratives too there must be a Change of Measures as well as a Discharge of Men And the Method I would humbly offer is this  First To make the Interest of  England  your chief Design and Aim and since you are an  English  King to become intirely an  Englishman England  is a Nation jealous of Rivals in her Prince's Favour and thinks her self deserving of all his Care and all his Caresses If the People of  England  think you have a favourable Opinion of them they will endeavour to deserve it if not they may perhaps deserve your worst Opinion too This Humour of the Nation Queen  Elizabeth  found early and apply'd her self so happily to it as by this single Point to master all her Difficulties the greatest it may be that ever Prince had to struggle with whereas her Successors by contrary Measures brought themselves into very unfortunate Circumstances  In the next place Sir let me desire you to avoid concerning your self in Elections of Members in Parliament or influencing them when chosen the Parliament is a sacred part of the  English  Constitution and like the  Israelites  Ark of old is not to be touch'd profanely but with great Danger to those who touch it so And therefore Sir it will be  ur true Interest to leave the People free to their Choice  d the Members free to their Opinions when chosen  is still fresh in our Memories how much the Practices  the late Reigns in corrupting Elections and closeting  embers of Parliament enrag'd the Nation and they  d reason to resent it for if for the sake of a Vote a  ember of Parliament shall be plac'd in an Office of  rust he is not fit for this is destroying the Government  wo ways at once For to speak in the Phrase of the Ministry it is making a Parliament of Clouts and an Officer of Clouts at the same stroke Rejecting Bills offer'd  y Parliament of publick Benefit and for securing our  ntient Government and the Fundamental Rights of the  bject was highly displeasing to the Nation also in the  te Reigns and will be so in all Reigns As was likewise  e denying the People their undoubted Right of frequent  arliaments They had also in the late Governments an  nvention to make a Pump of the Parliament and by  ouring in a Pint of Water to fetch out a Tun This  as justly most provoking to the Nation and treasur'd up Wrath against the Day of Wrath  The refusing of Bills and the Contempt of Addresses  rom the Parliament against Ministers or in any other Cases has likewise given great Offence in former Reigns For tho the House of Commons seconded by the House of  ords cannot reach the Life or Estate of any Person but  y a full Proof in form of Law yet because it is so difficult a matter to come at such a Proof a Vote of the House of Commons against any Minister has always been esteem'd by all Kings who were well with the People a sufficient Reason for the removing them from Court and I have heard that our King  Henry  IV a warlike and wise Prince upon an Address from the Parliament against some of his Ministers reply'd  I know no Evil by these Men but if they are thought unfit by my Parliament for my Service I shall not think fit to continue them in it    All these things Sir therefore are most carefully to be avoided by your Majesty They will appear with a worse Grace in you who have declar'd and made War against these Practices than in your Predecessors For as St  Paul  says  Thou who hast said Ye shall not commit Adultery dost thou commit Adultery Thou who hast said Ye shall not steal dost thou steal  You must by no means Sir give this occasion of Clamour and Recrimination to your Enemies But be pleas'd to follow this General Rule always to beware of the Ministers and to avoid the Schemes and Counsels of King  Charles  and King  James  's Government and then you can scarce err For whatever is opposite to  their Principles and Practices is the direct Road to yo  Security and Success  In the next place Sir let Rewards and Punishment  be duly and impartially distributed this is a Rule  which all Ages and Governments have paid the greate  Respect and Observance and to which the present Mo+narch of  France  does chiefly owe the Prosperity of h  Affairs and without this Principle no Government ca  subsist Your Ministers who serve you well and faithfull  must be distinguish'd from those who betray you or serv  you carelesly and idely and not smil'd or frown'd upon as they are supported or persecuted by this or that Par  or Faction And by the way Sir a Prince in  Englan  that rules according to the Laws and Interests of his Pe  +ple will never have occasion to make his Court to an  Party or Faction nor can any Minister of any Part  serve you against the Interest of the Nation Let you  Soldiers be encourag'd and prefer'd according to their Bravery and Abilities without Favour or Affection Th  bravest otherwise will follow the Example of Cowards i  they find they have no Advantage over them by thei  Courage for all Men would be Cowards if they durs  To an  English  Soldier a Smile or a kind Word is as accep+table at some times as a Month's Pay and if you wil  condescend to a Commendation of what they do well the  will endeavour on the next occasion to exceed what the  did before For if you are once Master of their Love you are sure to have the Disposal of their Lives No  need you fear to punish them severely provided you reward them bountifully Let the Insolence of your Enemies be rebuk'd and Rebels and Traitors to your Govern+ment be severely punish'd and not courted and caress'd for in the present State of Affairs all Mercy to your Ene+mies is Cruelty to your self and Friends and it encourage  your Enemies and disheartens your Loyal Subjects to se  these Insolents brave the Government unpunish'd and t  see your treacherous Ministers solliciting the Pardon o  every condemn'd Traitor and making their Court to King  James  at the Price of your Safety is most provoking to every good Man Besides it looks like your having a Doubt of your own Right and Title to the Government▪ to be thus backward in asserting it and is so interpreted by the Jacobites  Intelligence as another Point of mighty Consequence and can scarce be purchas'd too dear For it is the Sou  of Government and directs all its Actions properly and without it you consult in the dark and execute blind fold you know not what to act what to fear where to attack  or where to defend I do not mean by this that we are to penetrate into the  French  King's Counsels or rifle his Cabinet that I am afraid is out of the reach of our Power and of our Purse But I cannot but think we may be able to know the Marches of their Armies and the Motions of their Fleets without selling our Souls to the Devil for Intelligence or breaking our Exchequer  Thus Sir I have set before your Majesty what in my poor Judgment is for your Interest to pursue and what is for your Service to avoid what will make your Majesty and this Nation happy what will make both unhappy and I heartily pray the great good and wise God to di  t bless and prosper your Majesty in all your glorious  signs for the Defence of these Kingdoms and of  Christe  dom  against the common Enemy If I have us'd too great a Freedom or have offended in what I design'd for your Service I am sorry for it I call God to witness my Plainness proceeded from my Zeal and Affection to your Interests and the Prosperity of your Affairs and not from any factious saucy or unmannerly Principle I wish some abler Pen had taken upon him this Part But I must own it provok'd me to see my Country and my King so forsaken the one of Advocates the other of honest Counsel and this urg'd me to take upon me these two Characters of Advocate and Adviser both which I confess my self very unfit for Not but that as I said in the beginning I take it to be the Privilege nay and the Duty too of every  English  Subject provided it be perform'd form'd with a decent and due Respect to lay before the King such Matters as may be dangerous to his Person or Government to be conceal'd from his Knowledg for we are not ty'd up in  England  to  Spanish  Forms where the King must be wet to the Skin if he whose proper Office  o is be not in the way to put on his Cloke And I beg your Majesty to believe what I have said is from a Faithfulness and Sincerity which will in all Accidents and Difficulties preserve me unalterably  Your Majesty's Most Loyal most Dutiful and most Obedient Subject  To the honest  English  Protestant READER  Honest Reader  AT the beginning of the late Revolution I dare say it wa  not expected by thee or me That it would have been n  +cessary in this Reign to have enter'd into Argument  whether the Principles of  Whig  or  Tory  are most agreeable to t  Constitution of the  English  Monarchy or which Party were to b  chosen for the Support of our present King and Queen But suc  is our Fate that I am afraid it requires an abler Pen than min  to convince some who it is highly necessary should be convinc'd that any of the Measures of the late Reigns were mistaken the  are taught to believe those Monarchs in the Right nay e  those evil Counsellors too who were so maul'd in the Declaratio  of and none are Rogues and Villains and deserve to b  hang'd but those who were most active in the bringing the preset King and Queen over and in settling the Crown upon their Heads I thought it therefore high time that this Matter should be se  right and in order to it that the Principles and Practices o  Whig  and  Tory  should be truly and impartially examin'd whic  I have endeavour'd to do to the best of my Knowledg and shall b  well pleas'd to see any other do it better from my poor Hint  acknowledg the Looseness of the Stile the want of Method in th  following Paper and the many Repetitions this Dialogueway  writing is liable to will lay it open to the Lash of every Pedan  and Schoolmaster But know I write not for Fame or out o  any Vanity of being an Author  and therefore I come not to you  as the Apostle says  in the inticing Words of Man'  Wisdom but in Plainness and Truth  c I have state  the Matter so fairly that some of the  Tories  may be Fools enough perhaps to think I have given them a Victory and triumph o  their Admirals did in their being Gazetted because the Council wo  +  Favourable as to suffer them to pass for mistaken Blockheads  ead of wilful knavish Lyars But indeed I thought the  Tories  so weak a Plea that I might well allow them to make the  st of it and have left nothing unsaid which I have ever heard  m say in their Defence What they have done the honest  ople and the Interest of  England  most Mischief by is that  am of a  Commonwealth  which I have in the following Dis  rse I hope convinc'd all honest Men is a false Notion im  cticable and impossible in  England  however this is the Breast  rk which they have always cover'd themselves with when they  sign'd to fire upon the Rights and Privileges the Laws Liber  s and Properties of their Country And whenever they do raise  is Breastwork we must endeavour to beat it about their Ears  am sure it is too weak to resist any Attack and I hope as  ays  says  they fly they fly they fly who first did make  at Lye  What I have here written is with an honest Design of  ing Service to my Country and if it either happens to inform  convince any to embrace the Publick Interest and the common  od of themselves and FellowCreatures I have my end And  r the  Tory Criticks  they may bite till their Teeth meet thro  Book yet I shall be as insensible of their Malice as they have  en of the King's Mercy Favour and Friendship to them I will  mfort my self honest Reader that I have thee on my side and  long as thou dost continue firm in the Support of the  English  aws and Liberties thou dost build upon a Rock against which  hope the Gates of Hell shall not prevail and so long I will  uild upon thee and hope for all Good from thee and pray for all  lessings upon thee  Adieu  A Dialogue between  WHIG  and  TORY c  Tory  WELL met old Acquaintance who would have thought seven years ago to have seen you and I at  Whitehall  together in the same Interest  Whig  In the same Interest why who thinks that now  Tory  What in one of your old peevish Fits I thought now all things go to your Mind you would have been in better Humour  Whig  You were begotten born and bred in Mistakes and I doubt not but you will continue so to your end Yet you cannot be so grosly mistaken sure as to think all things go to any honest  Englishman  's Mind when you who were the Tools of the two last Reigns the Instruments of all our past and present Misfortunes and the declar'd Cause of the War which brought on the late Revolution are notwithstanding the only Men courted by this Government  Tory  I am afraid you will never be pleas'd with any Monarchical Government  Whig  That is a Point I know you have been long endeavouring to put upon the World but more industriously upon the Court yet I wonder at your Impudence of urging it now since it is so fresh in every Man's Memory how zealously the Whigs struggled in the late Convention to settle the Monarchy whilst you contested as zealously to make it an Anarchy  Tory  We will talk more of this by and by But if you were so instrumental as you say in setting up this Government why are you so out of Humour with what you have made your selves  Whig  Disappointment you must allow a just Cause of  esentment We hop'd from new Lords new Laws new  inisters and new Methods but if still we are to have  e same Ministers and consequently the same Methods  he very Tools of the two last Reigns and consequently  he same Work this I take in my Lord  H  s Phrase  be a Change without an Alteration and in my Opi  n gives too just occasion of Dislike and I cannot but  nk this way of managing Affairs must end unhappily  oth to Prince and People  Tory  But how come you and I to be so concern'd either  or the Prosperity of Princes who never think of us  ut as we can serve some present Turn of theirs or for the  nterest of Mob who will sing Ballads upon us under the  allows when we are hanging there for their sakes Pre  ee  Whig  grow wise and do not torment thy self thus  ith StateAffairs let Princes take care of themselves and  he People of themselves and let us take care of ourselves My Method is to get what I can and let Courts do what they will  Whig  Why then Sir with your leave your Method is  foolish as it is knavish For whoever sells his Country  o a lawless Power leaves himself nor his Family no Certainty no Property in what he has gotten by his Treachery nay his Estate is as often the Snare as the Comfort of his Life It proves sometimes a  Naboth  's Vine  ard and makes him the Eyesore of some hungry Court Favourite And I would ask Whether a small Estate fenc'd about with Laws and the Possession thereof secur'd  o you and your Family is not of more Value than a much greater Revenue of which you cannot assure your self the Possession one minute Your Forefathers thought the Laws and Liberties of  England  worth their Care and Contest and waded thro Rivers of Blood to leave them in force to their Posterity And the Church once made it an Article of their Religion  Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari  But thou dost renounce all the Principles of Humanity of common Sense and of Religion and oughtst to be driven out of a Country which thou makest open Profession to sell and betray And as for what you say of the Ingratitude of Princes and People the one to his faithful and affectionate Subjects the other to their zealous Patriots this does not discharge you from your Duty to either But in answer to the first if you will serve Princes no farther than you serve your Country in serving them that Service will always reward it self and for the Mob as you are ever pleas'd most mannerly to call your Countrymen and FellowCitizens if any prove so sordid as you  alledg I shall answer you in the words of our Saviour  Forgive them for they know not what they do  And let his Ex+ample teach you better Principles who notwithstanding all the Scoffs and Indignities he met with laid down h  Life upon the Cross for the Benefit of Mankind B  your Principles make you the Triumph of Heathens a  bring you upon the same foot with brute Beasts  Tory  Come don't tell us Stories of our great Grandfat  who troubled themselves about Trifles There is a Fashio  in Government as well as in Clothes which must  comply'd with according to the Humour of the prese  Age and you may as well pretend to shape all Gowns b  Queen  Elizabeth  's Fardingale as to shape our Court  Counsels according to the Sentiments of that or othe  times which were as different too from one another  we are different from them  Whig  As for your Fashion of Government Mr  Tor  I hope it is either gone to the Grave with King  Charles    to  France  with King  James  and could heartily wish yo  would follow it to either Place But pray before you g  let me ask you in what Age or Time it was that Men  Sense or Men of Honour did prefer Will and Pleasure  Laws or Slavery to Freedom As I take it the Prin+ciples of Liberty and Property have always been in fashion amongst Men of Sense and Estates in  England  and eve  will be But your Principles can never find Professors bu  amongst Fools and Beggars  Tory  Whatever our Principles are you find both the  and us prefer'd to you and yours even by a Government of your own chusing and let that satisfy you as an An+swer to that Point  Whig  Not at all that only proves a Mistake some+where and where the Mistake is if you please we wi  inquire and I think it will best appear by examining th  original Rise Principles and Practices of both Parties  Tory  Come on then a clear Stage and no favour  Whig  As for your original Rise 'tis certain you ow  your being known in the World to the horrid and exe+crable Designs of the two late Kings to set up arbitrary Power and Popery amongst us then were all the Jails Brothels and Kennels rak'd for Villains of fear'd Con+sciences and desperate Fortunes your  Arlns Cliffd  Oss  were then thought upon for Ministers of State and under them were bred such a pack of Wretches as th  Court of  Tiberius  would have been asham'd of In the La  they were of the same sort with the Ministry Wha  Age can parallel your  Nms  your  Nths  you  Jeffys Scgs Rainds Wris  c and  ir under Managers  Graham  and  Burton  c Then  to the Pillars of what they then call'd  the Church of  land  tho so disguis'd at that time that it was scarce  wn by its most dutiful most affectionate and most  is Children I need say no more of them than that  were compos'd of Bishops and a Clergy prefer'd by  Kings who were about to set up Popery and Tyranny  therefore were to chuse such Men into the Govern  nt of the Church who they thought would be most  plying with those Purposes and whose Looseness of  als might bring most Discredit upon the Protestant  igion and whoever remembers  Parkr Cartt    nows  Cw  and  Watn  will I think be of the  inion they were not ill chosen for the abovesaid Pur  es  Tory  But you see whatever Purposes they were chosen  several of the Bishops oppos'd Popery with the grea  Bravery imaginable  Whig  True they did oppose a Popish Clergy being  ight into their Bishopricks Churches and Colleges  who but a mad Man would have expected any other  n them But did they ever stick at any thing that  ht advance arbitrary Power over the Laity Did they  conjure the People to PassiveObedience NonRe  nce  c  Did they not tie us Hand and Foot and  ow us like  Daniel  into the Lions Den Nay did they  r stick at building his Popish Church for him whilst  contented himself to make use of their Hands But  en they saw that after they had gone so far in the Service others were taken in to finish the Work and to reap  e Fruit of what they had sow'd and planted This was  deed intolerable and then it was and not before that  ey begun to make a noise about the  Protestant Religion  and  nglish Liberties  and to preach backward all their former  ermons  Tory  But you cannot deny but that they were very in  rumental to the Revolution  Whig  I own they were for some time like Fishes who  ave got a Worm in their Heads they did frisk and leap  ut of their own Element but like them too they soon  ung'd into it again for King  James  was scarce got to  eversham  before they repented what they had done and  om that day to this have given all the Proofs and Marks  an invincible Hatred and Enmity to the present Government They oppos'd the King's coming to the Crown  ell into Cabals for the weakning his Government when  e was King and rais'd Rebellion without and Plots within the Kingdom for the restoring King  James  c  Nay at this time it is undeniable that wherever th  Clergy are most numerous the  Jacobites  are most nume+rous too there are more  Jacobites  ten for one in ever  Cathedral Town than in any other Towns accountin  number for number And how the Universities are gene+rally disaffected to this Government is notorious the reproach and rail against the very Bishops and Clergyme  prefer'd in this Reign The Archbishop of  Canterb  himself whose Learning Piety and Excellencies of a kinds are so eminent that it seems impolitick in them a  well as unjust to reproach him yet him too do they ra  +scoff at and treat with the foulest Invectives In shor  those who every day piously attend the Service and reli+gious Worship of the Church who most frequently a  Communicants in the holy Sacrament these they will no  +withstanding call  Presbyterians canting whining Hypocrit  c and esteem none sound Members of their Body b  those who drink with them and come up to all the  highest Points of Dominion Tyranny and Uncharitabl  +ness to all those who are not of their Faction I will no  call it their Church because I think it a Dishonour to th  best Reform'd Church in the World to be serv'd by such a Clergy as are not only a Scandal to the Name of Pro+testant but to the Name of Religion and who unde  the Title of Protestant Priests are labouring with a  their Power the Return of King  James  with his Poper  and Slavery and preach and pray openly for his Restora+tion whilst no Exhortation for Obedience to our presen  King our great Deliverer from Popery and Slavery heard from any Pulpit no PassiveObedience nor No  resistance is nam'd in this Reign And if for the sake  their Livings they are forc'd to pray for the King an  Queen it is in so faint and low a Voice as if they ha  no mind to be heard either by God or the People  Tory  Some few discontented Persons there may be per+haps who may deserve this Character but I hope yo  do not lay this Charge upon the whole Clergy of  England  Whig  No I know there are many religious learned an  good Men amongst them and there will I hope be more if this Government continues But that the Number  not small who have refus'd the Oaths to this present Government you cannot deny and that most of the HighChurch as they call themselves those who as a learne  Doctor said have the  Spirit of the Church  in which the  were bred tho they will not say with St  Paul  they have the  Spirit of God  The first Instance I have met of their Modesty  Most of this Order I say profess to  e the Oath of Allegiance to this King as he is King  facto  not  de jure  And by the Example of these Re  end Clergymen the LayKnaves and Fools are di  ted to take Oaths with mental Reservations and pri  e Interpretations and Distinctions And having no  inciple but that of SelfInterest in which case you  r renounce all Justice all Humanity to your Fellow  eatures you profess Slavery to some that you may  d it over others yea renounce and trample upon all  ws to serve a Turn make a Jest of Liberty and Proper  ▪ And to gratify your Pride or Avarice you have be  ray'd your Country persecuted and murder'd your inno  nt Countrymen and FellowCitizens sold your Neigh  rs to the  French  King and your Laws and Religion to  late Kings and even from the same Principles have  en endeavouring to bring about the same Practices in  s Reign too and in order to it have been tempting  ur Lord and Master in the Language of the Devil to  Saviour  All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall down  worship me  and I hope he will answer you in his  rds upon that occasion  Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy  ng  Thus have I given you in few Lines an Account of  e Rise Principles and Practices of your Party with  hich I could fill a Volume But I consider the Nation  eds only a general Hint to refresh their Memory to  rticulars For the Smart of the Wounds receiv'd in the  e Reigns from you is yet most sensible to many honest  glish  men  Tory  If this Devil of a  Tory  be so black as you paint  m I wonder how he comes by so fair a Character and  numerous a Party in the Nation and so great a Coun  nance from all Courts of contrary Interests  Whig  Fair Appearances and great Numbers prove no  ing the leudest Srumpets are often fair and Fools and  naves have in all Ages outnumber'd the Wise and Ho  est How ye  Tories  came to have so great a Countenance  om the last Court I have already shew'd and will  ince you command me shew you how ye became the  avourites of this Court too even by the same Means  nd the same Man that made you Favourites in King  harles  's Time For the M of  C  after all his mischie  ous Management of Affairs in that Reign having by  n ill Fate to this poor Nation got into some small Pre  ence of Merit by little Assistances he gave to the late Revolution upon this he sets up again for Ministry But being apprehensive that those honest Gentlemen who had  o bravely expos'd their Lives and Fortunes for the Re  emption of their Country and were so well acquainted  with his Methods in the late Reigns would be jealous o  his having too great a Credit with the King he though  it his best play to begin with them and from his firs  coming to Court labour'd to insinuate Jealousies into th  King of those Gentlemen as  Commonwealthsmen Haters  Monarchy  c and having likewise an implacable Pique t  Parliaments for their Impeachment and Imprisonment o  him he at the same time represents that part of the Go+vernment envious of the King's Power and always en+deavouring to make him a King of Clouts a Duke o  Venice  c Thus by misrepresenting the King's be  Friends he made way to bring in his old Practices an  his old working Tools whom he represented to be Me  of Business and Friends to Monarchy into this Cour  too and being assisted afterwards by the E of  N  an  some others ye have indeed carry'd all before you an  how much to the Interest of the Nation and the Honou  of the King let all the World judg who have seen thi  poor Kingdom every year for this last four years brough  to a reasonable Apprehension of being invaded from Abroad and betray'd at Home and in a word to subsis  only by a Miracle  Tory  All this rambling Story you have told is a wil  Supposition and straining the Intention of this nobl  Lord to your own malicious Purpose who design'd nothin  more in bringing in these Gentlemen you call the King  Enemies than by reconciling them to the King and hi  Government to make the Foundation of it broader an  deeper And I know not how this comes to be such  Crime and so ill Policy with us I have heard that  Henr  the Fourth of  France  who was esteem'd a wise and politick Prince thought it very good Kingcraft to cares  his Enemies of the League and to make his Court to the Jesuits  Whig  And pray what did he get by it Did he ever gain either of them heartily into his Interest Were not those of the League ever ready to plot with the  Spaniard  c against him And for his dear Friends of the Church not all his Renunciation of his old Religion and his old Friends not all his Gifts his Caresses and his Courtship could reconcile them to him or so much as save his Life when they had it in their Power to destroy it For those jealous Gentlemen the  Jesuits  never would believe they had his Heart till it was sent them in a Box to  La  A College of Je  its in  Anjou    Fleche  to be buried there  Tory  But notwithstanding your  Jesuits Tale of a Tub  I  undertake that all the  Tories  as you call them in  land  both Clergy and Laymen shall take the Oaths  the King and serve him heartily provided he will  one thing  Whig  What's that  Tory  Utterly discard you  Whigs  and give us the Penal  ws again upon the Fanaticks  Whig  And would that make the Foundation of the Go  nment broader and deeper as you talk'd just now  ides have you not heard a Story of one  Sampson  Sir  o after he had resign'd his Lock of Hair in which his  ength lay was deliver'd up to his Enemies by those he  trusted But supposing what you propose if gran  might win you to be  Williamites  were King  James  d yet I am mistaken if whilst he lives and the King  France  continues as powerful as at present you will ever  drawn by any Courtship to engage so far in the Inte  ts of this Government as to swear otherwise to the  ng than as King  de facto  nor will you make your Re  nciliation to King  James  desperate Answer to this  int plainly and truly  Tory  Wise Men will always secure a Retreat and Self  eservation is a first Principle with all Men And as a  entleman said wittily upon this occasion As long as the  overnment can maintain it self and will maintain me  is sure of me But I have liv'd too long at Court to die  Martyr for any Monarch and will always behave my  lf so in one Court as to be well with the next And  o perhaps this is not all that this Government might  asonably wish from us yet I can tell you they do not be  eve that they shall mend themselves by changing us for  u for divers and sundry Reasons  Whig  Pray let us have some of them  Tory  First because you are for a Commonwealth Go  rnment and Haters of Monarchy  Whig  That is that we are mad Men and void of all  ommon Sense and Reason for whoever hath either of  ese will know a Commonwealth to be a Chimera im  racticable and impossible to be brought about in  England  Macchiavel  be of any Authority he says in his  th  Chapter upon Government  That where there is not an Equa  ty in the Conditions and Estates of a People it is impossible for  hat People or Nation to erect and settle a Commonwealth  He gives you Examples to confirm this but I think there are some more to our purpose as being more recent and nearer home Upon the Revolt of the  LowCountries  from the  Spanish  Yoke it was necessary for them to put themselves  under some Form of Government and the For  being in their own free Choice seven of the seventee  Provinces who were a trading sort of People much upo  an Equality in their Condition and Fortune and had fe  Families of Nobility or Gentry among them fell natu+rally into a CommonwealthGovernment But the othe  ten Provinces having great Numbers of Nobility and Ge  +try tho they were more immediately under the Tyran  of the  Spaniard  and had been more particularly sensible o  D' Alva  's Cruelty and Oppression notwithstanding cho  rather to continue under the hated Government of  Spai  than to accept of the Invitation the other seven Province  had made them of coming into the more hated Project of Commonwealth so impossible it is to reconcile Men di  +tinguish'd by Titles and Fortunes to mix themselves in common Level with the People upon any Consideration o  Disgust whatsoever And whoever will look over wh  pass'd here in  England  from the Year to the Yea  will be yet more convinc'd of the Truth of th  Assertion and of the Nonsense of any Commonwealth Design in this Nation Perhaps there were never at an  time so many Men of strong Inclinations for a Commo  +wealthGovernment as then nor of greater Abilities t  effect such a Design And yet they found the Nobilit  Gentry and dignify'd Clergy such a Rub in their way i  no Art no Force could remove and at last they we  brought into that Confusion and Disorder by attempting i  that the very People and Army who were in this Projec  of a Commonwealth and had overthrown the Monarch  in order to it and could support  Cromwel  in a singl  Person yet after his Death saw a necessity of restoring th  Monarchy again and assisted towards it But this wa  the Dust which the two last Courts threw into the People Eyes when they would make them blind to arbitrar  Power and Popery and is now one great Artifice th  Jacobites  depend upon whereby to separate the Friends  this Government from its Support tho it will always be Jeft to understanding Men I have heard a Story of Lady who passing thro a Croud to her Coach and havin  a rich Jewel on her Breast cover'd the Jewel with one o  her Hands which a Pickpocket in the Croud observin  steps up to her and claps his Hand upon a Place belo  which he thought would oblige her to remove her Han  from her Breast to defend it But the Lady apprehendin  the Thief's Design very prudently neglected the fall Attack and apply'd both her Hands to the securing he  Jewel and by that means came off safe And so Gen+tlemen whenever you make your false Attack upon o  mmonwealth we shall for the future take it for the  nal to us that your real Aim is at our Liberties and  perties and shall apply both our Hands and Hearts to  securing those Jewels of inestimable Price But to be  ous in our case the  Whigs  as I said in the beginning of  Discourse have given sufficient Proof how little they  gn'd a Commonwealth and how hearty they were to  Monarchy in their struggling so zealously to set the  wn on the King's Head  Tory  We own you were for giving him the Name of a  g but after all speak sincerely did you design to  e him any more than a King of Clouts a Duke of  Ve  or a Stadtholder  Whig  We design'd to make him as great a King as the  ws of  England  and our antient Constitution make any  ng And if you pretend to make him more take the  nour of it But Sir upon this occasion your Party  e for making his present Majesty less than either a Duke  Venice  or a Stadtholder of  Holland  For in proposing to  e him a Regent you make him only a Journyman  g a Subject to King  James  and accountable to him  what the  Whigs  did to deserve being suspected of a  mmonwealth Design or of any Intention to lessen the  g's just Power I am yet ignorant  Tory  You are wilfully so then for what could the mea  g of the Convention be to settle the Revenue of the  wn from three Years to three Years and to take away  Revenue of the  ChimnyMony  one of the fairest Flowers  the Crown but lessening the King's Power and making  Government precarious  Whig  The ChimnyTax being grown a Grievance more  sible and more odious to the common People than any  er and the Danger of being enslav'd by giving such  at Revenues for Life to the two last Kings by  ch they were inabled to maintain Standing Armies  to subsist without Parliaments was so fresh in the  mories of all thinking  Englishmen  and so apprehended  them that the King's Friends thought it greatly for  Service to take away the Burden of the one and the  prehension of the other from the People and by using  ferent Methods to those which had been follow'd in the  rmer Reigns to make his present Majesty's Government  re acceptable to all good Men and that he might hereby  gn in the Hearts of his Subjects and be distinguish'd by  em which Method if pursu'd would have given us a  rer Prospect of our Affairs than at present I am afraid  have But this is not the Interest of wicked Ministers  o when Kings take their Courses lose these Dominion  over them their Business is therefore to make Prin  jealous of Encroachments of Parliaments of Comm  +wealth Designs amongst the People to represent the Kin  Interest separate from the Interest of his Subjects a  then to ingratiate themselves with him and raise th  +selves in his Opinion for their Parts and Abilities t  offer him Schemes of Politicks to prevent Designs aga  him which were never thoght on Thus these ho  Jago  's first work a Prince up to Jealousies and Hatred his People by false Suggestions and then as a Rem  against the Mischiefs they have suppos'd put him u  Designs ruinous to his Country and himself But in  mean time by appearing thus zealous for what they  the King's particular Interest and Glory they insin  themselves into some sort of Princes Favour they bec  Confidents of all CourtIntrigues and grow great  rich they dispose all Offices and crush all who are their Creatures and at last come to awe and govern Ki  themselves As WaitingWomen who when they h  debauch'd their Mistresses by their mercenary Sollic  +  tions and are become the Trustees of their Frailty t  no longer tast the Busk nor bitter Reproofs for misplac  a Pin or Patch but from Servants become Mistresses Faults are then found with them no Liberty deny'd the  even the Purse and the rich Petticoat is absolutely at WaitingWoman's Service till at last they bring th  Mistresses to Infamy and Beggary And so to return the Ministry again by this kind of Management t  make their Masters Kings of Clouts necessitous misera  and despis'd Princes For Example What made the  King  James  a King of Clouts but those evil Counsell  who put him upon a Despotick and Dispensing Pow  and propagating a Religion against Law who put  upon preferring Papists and  Irish  to Protestants and  Engl  who advis'd his seizing Colleges and Charters setting HighCommissionCourts and making Parliaments  Laws a Nose of Wax Deny this if you can Mr  T  Nay as to your IdolKing  Charles  II who notwi  +standing I believe much the worse of the two Broth  as sinning against a better Understanding and grea  Obligations was it not by these Counsels and some these Counsellors that this Gentleman was made a K  of Clouts too from having all the Advantages at the t  of his Restoration that ever King was bless'd with  was belov'd delighted in and courted by his Subjec  was respected Abroad in Plenty and Power at Home a  could direct the Votes of a Parliament with a Nod m  than he could at last with his Exchequer yet after  this in a few Years by the Management of some of  present Evil Counsellors who gave him ill Impressions  his Subjects made him out of love with Parliaments  poison'd him with lawless Power and Love of Tricks  worst of Poisons to an  English  King who for their  filthy Interest persuaded him to sell  Dunkirk  break  Triple League  and enter into Measures with  France  de  ctive to the Interest of this Nation and of all  Europe  these Measures I say he at last became distasteful to  Subjects and was forsaken by a Parliament the most  ch'd to him and in love with his Person to a Fault so  at last his Necessities drove him to become a Pensioner  France  A fine Character for an  English  King  And if you will believe Mr  Dryden  his Poet  reat he concluded his Reign in these miserable Cir  stances of being despis'd Abroad and living on Tricks  Home And how these Gentlemens Father and  ndfather were made Kings of Clouts by the like Mea  s and the like Ministers by endeavouring at lawless  ver and laying aside Parliaments  c  even the Histo  of those Times publish'd by their own Authority  ke it out plainly And now Mr  Tory  if you please  will examine a little into the few Examples we have  Princes who have practis'd a contrary method to  beforemention'd one we will inquire what Effects  t sort of Government has produc'd and we need go  farther I think than Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign the  mediate Predecessor to the  Scotish  Race to fetch a Com  ison that will answer all Objections And to give the  uty of her Government its due Lustre let us set it off  h the Difficulties that attended it and surrounded it  the beginning Let us consider her in the first place  the weaker Sexa Womanhaving no  A new Distinction our Statesman have lately found out  right  tho a lawful Titlethe greatest part of her  bjects of a contrary Religion to herThe Queen  Scotland  her next Neighbour a Pretender to the  own  Ireland  in open Rebellion The King of  Spain    greatest Monarch of  Europe  at that time her mortal  emy and InvaderPlots and Conspiracies by the  pists against her at homeAnd no Ally abroad but  e  Dutch  then an Infant State and supported by her  d yet we see this poor weak Woman in the midst of all  ese Disadvantages absolute and uncontroul'd at Home  ful and glorious Abroad This indeed seems very ex  ordinary let us inquire therefore what Methods were  then practis'd in order to the producing such wonder  Success Was it by corrupting Elections or making P  +sioners of ParliamentMenNo for her Court  pleaded as well in bar of being ParliamentMen as being Sheriffs that they were the Queen's Servants that by this we may reasonably conclude there was nothi  to be got by it in those DaysWas it by imployi  her Sister Queen  Mary  's Ministers or courting her Enem  the PapistsNoFor she made  England  too hot  the one and adorn'd almost every Gibbet in the Nati  with her Justice upon the otherWas it by a Standi  Army thenNot that neither for she had no Art  nor no Guards but her GentlemenPensioners and Y  men of the Guard I know you'l say  How the Devil a  she bring Matters about as she did without using any of  admir'd Methods of our late Times  In good soo  even by so homely and plain a Receipt that you'l lat  at me when I tell it youOnlyby loving and co  +ting the Love of her People and not preferring  Scotl  French  nor  Irish  Favourites to them as in the late Reig  By being just to their Rights and Liberties and devot  to their InterestsBy rewarding bountifully and p  +nishing severelyBy encouraging honest Men a  browbeating StateProjectors and Tricksters Kna  who persuade Princes that their Interest is separate fr  the Interest of their Peoplewho counsel them stretch Prerogative or be overfond of itwho end  +vour to breed unkind Thoughts in them to their be  Friends and honestest Subjects This sort of Gentlem  were out at Heels in her time She like a truly wi  Woman never seem'd fond of Despotick Dominion n  of those who flatter'd her with it and put her upon i  for she knew that  Nolo Dominari  is the readiest way  Power in  England  and that it is soonest  found of those w  seek it not  Shewisely thought that to be th  Deliverer of Europe  was a greater Character than to b  Conqueror of it  and that it would be more truly glorio  to redeem one single Town from Slavery than to enslav  the whole World Not like some of her Successor  who unworthy to be Sovereigns of the Noble Order th  Kings of  England  wear have chosen rather to be th  Dragon than St  George  rather to destroy than to defe  their Kingdoms She never took Mony from her Subject  but she gave them a Pennyworth for their Penny an  was seldom nice in affording them such Laws as the thought necessary to their Safety For being well assur  or her own just intentions she never suspected their And thus at last she got an absolute Power even over th  sas a good Wife gets a Power over her Husband  oving and obeying him And now I think I have suf  ently exemplify'd what sort of Ministers and Methods  are which make Princes great and glorious Monarchs  which make them Kings of Clouts And whether this  er Character belongs to the  Whig  or  Tory  I submit to  Judgment of every impartial and reasonable Man But  n with your Charge  Tory  It is objected against you  Whigs  also that you do  love the King's Person  Whig  What an Accusation hast thou blunder'd upon  n very  Irish Tory  thou eternal Trifler Not love the  g's Person'Tis a Thought fit only for a Chamber  d when the Chaplain or Valet offer their Service to  Kings are to be lov'd by Millions of their Subjects  o never see their Persons as Heaven is by Mankind  their Providence and Care of their People for the In  nces they dispense of their Justice and Mercy and for  universal Good and Benefits which they scatter amongst  ir Subjects And in this Point their Thoughts and  signs should be Godlike and by any other sort of  vers than these any King will be as slenderly accom  ny'd in his Misfortunes as King  James  was to  Feversham    t beside this Accusation is as false as it is foolish pray  Who shew'd the most early Inclination to the Prince  Orange  's Person the  Whigs  or the  Tories  Who went  o  Holland  first and begun the Project of the Prince of  ange  's coming over hither  Whigs  or  Tories  Who put the  own upon his Head when he did come  Whigs  or  Tories  t to come nearer to the Point Did not the  Whigs  shew  most apparent Partiality to the Prince of  Orange  's Person  all the Points of the Settlement of the Crown and  rticularly in giving it him for Life overlooking at the  me time the P of  D  's Title and the Lineal Succession  id they not to a Man stand by the King's Authority in  e Debate concerning the P of  D  's Revenue and leave  e Disposal of that Affair intirely to the King's Pleasure  nd now after four Years being us'd like the worst of  nemies for all these Services after being shut out from  eaking to the King and almost from seeing him after  eing discountenanc'd and frown'd upon they have notwithstanding like the humorous Lieutenant ever shew'd  grutching to his Grace upon the least Incouragement or  nvitation and have at the opening of every Sessions for three Winters successively still been ready to swallow the  ame Sweetnings and to be coaks'd by a Clap on the Cheek like an old City Cuckold and Cully and have been wrought into a Credulity which nothing but their  Fondness and Dotage on the King's Person could ha  effected  Tory  But you will not deny that you have sometim  express'd your selves peevishly concerning the King  Whig  And what Lover that hangs or drowns hims  for his Mistress does not do the same Railing in a Lo  is an infallible Symptom that he is far gone in the Distem+per and no Woman ever yet resented it when it ca  from that Cause But our Court has not learn'd to distin+guish between those who are angry with them in conce  for their Prosperity and those who seem'd pleas'd wi  them in hopes that they are in the way to Destructi  And to speak plainly Sir the Partiality and Courtsh  which the King hath shew'd to you  Tories  in spite of  your apparent Hatred of his Person as well as your pr  +fess'd Dislike of his Title and Government and the Av  sion he has shew'd to the  Whigs  and Contempt of all the Advances and Addresses has begotten ugly Reasonings  jealous and prying Men as if there were a Biass towar  the Principles of former Governments rather than  those this Government declar'd for and set up upon An  even the wise and wellmeaning  Tories  begin once aga  to smell a Td when you hold it so near their Nos  But come proceed  Tory  You are likewise accus'd of being wedded to  Party and by that means will reduce his Majesty to  King of a Faction only of his Subjects  Whig  This will appear much otherwise if you w  please to remember who brought in the E of  N  to b  Secretary of State and many others of that Party a  how few of your Faction were displac'd by the  Whigs  whe  they had Interest with the King But this Charge wi  appear most foully true upon you who by the basest In+gratitude and Villany fell upon undermining those wh  brought you into the Government the minute you wer  possess'd of the King's Ear And yet you see notwith+standing all your barbarous Treatment of us we have al+ways come in chearfully to all Votes for Mony all Loans and all other Measures to support your Credit and the com+mon Interest till both are fallen so low that the People Clamors were never so loud nor their Dissatisfaction never so great You like  Solomon  's Harlot are for tearing the Government asunder if you may not have the Po  session of it We have shew'd on the other hand true mo+therly Tenderness and consented rather that it should remain in your Possession intirely than be torn in piece  betwixt us till it appear'd to all the World what a vile Stepmother you have been and how you have starv'd and  s'd a Government worthy your most indulgent Tender  s and Care And yet I am not for refusing any  Tory  t gives proof of his sincere Repentance and of a  ve to his Country but with all my heart would give  share of the fatted Calf to make the returning Pro  al welcome tho I cannot but think it reasonable that  should submissively seek the Government and not the  vernment submissively seek you that you should own  r Sin against Heaven and against your Country and  e Security of another course of Life for the future  not justify your Faults and persevere in them If I  ld see amongst any of you the least Consideration for  common Good and Benefit of Mankind and the universal Welfare of your FellowCreatures to which you  bound by the Law of God and the Law of Nature  to which all the Heathens who were not barbarous  d a most profound Reverence and Obedience and pre  'd to all private Interest to Wives Children Estate  to Life it self If I can find any amongst you a Lover  his Country a sincere Supporter of the Laws Liber  s and Interest of the  English  Nation I am as much his  rvant tho he be a  Notm  a  Can  or a  Rr    if he were a  Sh  a  Rull  a  Somrs  or a  d  But instead of shewing any regard to the In  rest of the Nation any Bowels for your Country any  elfdenial in point of private Interest have you not sold  ur Country and their Birthrights upon all Occasions  ike  Esau  for a Mess of Pottage Have not some of  u put off Human Nature Human Reason and all common Honesty so far as to conspire to bring in a  French  ower to gratify your private and personal Piques To  ring in Popery and Slavery to rule over you because you  annot tyrannically rule over your FellowSubjects Remember what the  Presbyterians  got by being so active in  estoring the two late Popish Kings hoping to be reveng'd  hereby upon the  Independents  and other Dissenters Were  hey not mingled in the same Persecution with the others  ay more oppress'd and mark'd out for Wrath as being more numerous and more considerable than any other Sect  ust so must the  Church  and their Proselites expect to fare  rom the hands of their Popish Friends whose Cause they  re so zealously propagating they may admit them to the Honour of being the  Cat'sfoot  but not a bit of the  Ches  ut  No  Whig  no  Fanatick  but will then have as fair Quarter at least from King  Lewis  as you for King  James  I take to be only a Cypher and Property to your  French  Lord and Master who when he has finish'd his Work will finish his Life too And do you  Jure Divino    you truly loyal Gentlemen think that you will find mo  Favour then for being more attach'd to King  James  Interest No be assur'd the most inveterate Enemies  King  James  will meet with as favourable a Treatment a  least as you who have profess'd your selves so violent  enamour'd of King  James  's Person and of the right Line Reflect a little upon the King of  France  's Conduct at the time of the late Revolution He knew long before the Prince of  Orange  's Design of making a Descent into  England  and could have prevented it a thousand ways but inste  of that he writes to  Barillon  then his Ambassador  England  to know in what condition King  James  was  oppose the Prince's Forces He being a Foreigner an  judging only by outward Appearances represents th  Army of King  James  sufficiently powerful to resist what Force the Prince of  Orange  could bring whereupon th  French  King believing that the  English  and  Dutch  wou'd b  this means weaken and destroy one another and leave  fair Game for him the next Year against the Emperor and  Flanders  and to take away all Apprehension from the  Dutch  of their needing an Army for their own Defence and to give all Encouragement to their Design upon  Eng+land  he draws all his Troops from the side of  Flanders  and falls upon  Philipsburgh  which Army if he had march'  towards the  Spanish  Frontiers in  Flanders  the  Dutch  dur  not have transported a Man and the whole Design of th  Descent had been at an end From hence it is plai  what Friendship the  French  King had for his dear Brother King  James  and what you may expect from this Man o  Honour and good Nature when you have serv'd his turn  Come grow wise and honest and let us not divide under this or that Ministry under this or that Faction or Party but let us all unite against the common Enemy let us make the Publick Interest and the Support of the Go+vernment as it is establish'd by Law our chief and only Aim and for all Projectors and Conspirators whether for a  Commonwealth  or  French Tyranny  or any other  Tyranny  I wish they were all hang'd on the same Tree the first for Fools the others for Miscreants and Villains And thus much and no more am I for being wedded to a Party  Tory  I own you have told us a fair Tale but nothing i  prov'd nothing appears undeniable but your Venom and Enmity against the Church and her Friends  Whig  If you mean the  French  Story needs proving the Disgrace of  Barillon  when he return'd to  Versailles  upon the account of mistaking and misrepresenting the  English  Affairs is notorious But besides the Story proves it self  e than a thousand Witnesses and for the rest I have  ted nothing but what every  English  Man is knowing of  d as for what you charge me with in relation to the  urch I see little reason for it unless as St  Paul  says  account me your Enemy because I tell you the Truth  my part I reverence the Church of  England  as much  any Man But I am not for sacrificing the Laws and  erties of the Publick nay the very Nation it self to a  eign Conquest for the Sound of a word I have a due  ect for the Priesthood too and am their  Servant  but  er can submit to be their  Slave  I honour their Coat  cannot be content to strip my self of mine in respect to  A moderate Respect is decent and our Duty more  ke to be Superstition at least if not Idolatry and to  ship a wooden Priest appears to me as bad as worship  g a wooden God  Tory  Now you are running into your usual Violence  Heat and let me tell you as a Friend it does you no  d neither with the Church nor Court which latter has  ery low Opinion of those Men who express too much  rmth in what they say or do  Whig  And therefore their Affairs have succeeded accor  gly Let the Nation be Judg Whether if Men of  rmth had been put in Office by our Ministers the  xes would not have been more justly and carefully col  ted than they have been by those lukewarm Mana  rs they have employ'd who like the unjust Steward  en the King's due was an Hundred bid their Neigh  urs write down Fifty Or do you think the Deputy  eutenants of  Surry  would have absconded last Year when  ey were order'd to raise the Militia upon King  James  's  ming down to  Normandy  if they had been Men of  armth to the Government Or that King  James  's  iends would dare to profess their Opinions and carry  their Designs so publickly That they would presume  insult the Government in every Coffeehouse nay in  e  Mall  and  Whitehall  it self That they would dare to  reaten you to your teeth as they do with Invasions  escents and Rebellions or would venture to correspond  ith  France  and go forward and backward every day to  ing  James  nay raise Regiments of Horse and Foot un  er your noses for a Rebellion if Men of Warmth and  eal were in the Government But it is from hence  hat all these Insolences take their Rise that the Enemies  f the Government are come from hating it to despise it  hat its Friends are discourag'd to appear for it and that  hose Officers and Soldiers who in King  Charles's  time  ould have broken the Heads of those whom they heard  reflect upon the King's Person or Government will  this Reign hear both treated very odly not that t  want Affection to either but out of a fear to offend  shewing themselves  Men of warmth  and  Partymen  th  Characters being so abominable to our Court  Tory  You  Whigs  have been the occasion of all this t  for you were so irreconcilable to some Ministers of St  at the beginning of the Revolution because they h  made a few slips in the late Reigns or perhaps beca  they had hang'd some of your Friends a Father or B  +ther or so that you forc'd them to take in some Perso  whom they themselves thought not very proper for t  Government But if you will run a Man down he  support himself at any rate for Men are but Men A  withal I believe they hop'd that a Place would buy a  Party out of their Principles and that all whom th  brought into the Government would be oblig'd by th  means to be for the Government  Whig  This is very far fetch'd Mr  Tory  tho it is t  the first time I have heard it But as to the first part  this Paragraph the Matter of Fact is false The  Wo  were willing to forget all past Miscarriages and be reco  +cil'd to any Minister that could be honest as I shew  you before But these Gentlemen quickly convinc'd a  the World that they were grown so old and stiff in the former Mischiefs that they were capable of no oth  Bent or Impression but what they had taken in the la  Reigns And it was plain to every Man who had Ev  that they were no sooner in the Ministry but they fe  into their old Schemes which no honest Man could com  into and which I am afraid the Court has not found th  good Effects from which these  Evil Counsellors  promis'  It's true by giving Places to all that were supple an  complying you have brought in the Knaves of all Parties But since that which brings them into the Service of th  Government is their own Interest and not that of th  Government it will be reasonable for our Rulers to ex+pect that the whole Design of such Men will be rathe  how to serve themselves of the Government than ho  to serve it To conclude Sir notwithstanding all yo  have said in excuse of your Ministers and their Method  I cannot but remain in my first Opinion That  the Men  easy Phlegm born on the Confines of Indifference  as Sir  Samue  Tuke  in  Fchlike Fustian  describes our lukewarm Neutrals are not fit Men to be employ'd in our Government as the Case stands at present but will prove as destructive to i  as downright  Jacobites    Tory  All this is taking things for granted which we  y and accusing Men of what you do not prove and  were so you confess there are Knaves of your Party  Whig  The Truth of what I say in relation to your Par  is so notorious to all the World that it would be as  ertinent to go about proving it as to prove there is  n even you your selves have confess'd and preten  to repent of your Principles and Practices in King  mes  's time tho you are now return'd to your Vomit  as to what you say of our having Knaves amongst us  ust confess it too true and am as much afflicted as  can be that any  Whig  should invade your undoubted  sole Right of being Knaves and selling and betray  their FellowSubjects But yet we hope we may claim  distinction to be made betwixt our Party who not only  fess but have maintain'd to the death the Religion  ghts and Libertys of their Country and yours who  King  Charles  's and beginning of King  James  's Reign  e up all these things and who tho you are employ'd  and sworn to the present Government made publick  joicings at the Slaughter of our Armies and Destruc  on of our Fleets If the  Whigs  have the misfortune of  me Knaves professing themselves of their Party our  viour himself had a  Judas  amongst his Twelve and  t that did not at all discredit the Doctrine and  inciples of the Apostles nor does our having some  naves among us make it as reasonable and equal to ad  ere to your Party that are the profess'd Enemies of  eir King and Country as to depend on those who  ave generally in all times and on all Occasions declar'd  heir Affection to their Country Love of its Laws and  eligion and have since the Revolution shew'd their Zeal  or the present Establishment  Tory  Just now you seem'd to agree to a Comprehension  nd were for welcoming the Prodigals as you call'd them  ow you are for excluding them again  Whig  No I am for receiving any  Tory  as I told you  hat seeks the Government and becomes a true Penitent  ut I would not have the Government seek them nor would I have them entrusted in this critical time without some marks of their Repentance and Regeneracy and by our Easiness give them the Opportunity of selling us to the  French  K or K  James  as I fear some of 'em do at this time  Tory  All that's Malice and Stuff and not reasonably to be apprehended And I tell you once more it is the Opinion of some wise Men that the King cannot follow  a more fatal Counsel than to confine himself to any on  Party of his Subjects  Whig  Then your Patrons have been advising him fatall  these four Years for they have been persuading the Kin  to throw himself intirely into your hands  Tory  They never refus'd to receive any Whig tha  would comply and come under their Protection but  the King will chuse any one Party I think we of th  Church are the most numerous and considerable and ar  fittest as such to be employ'd by him  Whig  Now you are retir'd into your Sanctuary  th  Church  you think you are safe and it is indeed dangerou  pursuing you But however I'll venture it and since yo  force me I must repeat again some of those Argument  I have given you already why you are not fit to b  trusted by this Government First you Tories do no  believe your selves King  William  's Subjects and therefor  are very unfit to be employ'd by him as his Servants▪ Secondly it cools the Affections of the People to se  those employ'd in Places of highest Trust who they hav  a Demonstration are not for the Government even whe  they are in it And by this Method it is plain the King according to the Fable loses his  Shoulder of Mutton  by catching at the  Shadow  and by aiming at both Parties he has neither  Tory  I confess I am for the King's relying on one Party as much as you are tho not yours but however there are great and wise Men as I told you of another Opinion and I have heard it ask'd Why this method of uniting all Parties should not have as good an effect here as in  Holland  for there the Prince of  Orange  reconcil'd all to the common Interest  Whig  I'll tell you why First it appears all Parties there sincerely intended the Good of the Government which it is too plain is not your case Secondly Neither Party had any other Head to repair to as you  Tories  have The Prince of  Orange  had no pretending Rival to the Right of Stadtholder but the King has here a Rival a FatherinLaw who pretends a Right to the Crown who is supported by the greatest Power that ever was known in  Europe  so as to make the Event appear doubtful even to those who are most zealous to this Government And by this means the Friends of King  James  are encourag'd to be firm to his Interests and Neutrals nay and even his fearful Enemies are frighted from acting with a Zeal against him Is this a time then to be trying Experiments to put our selves and our Affairs into the  hands of Men bred up and principled against the Design of this Government Is this a time to reconcile our  lves to our Enemies and to take Men out of Plots and place them in our Cabinet No sure with my Lord  N  's leave  this is not the time  In this time of danger those who have been the antient and declar'd Enemies of King  James  and who have most reason to expect being hang'd if he return are most fit for the King to rely on But when these Difficulties are master'd as much Comprehension as you please In the mean time your Education in  Toryism  your Obligations to King  James  and which is more than both your present Hopes from him will make you so averse to this Government that no Favour no Courtship can engage you heartily in its Interests and it is nonsense to expect you should fight for a Title you have always declar'd to disapprove of  Tory  You are always harping upon that string But  pposing we do not approve of the making him King  t we know how to obey Kings when they are made but  u after you have made a King are using him like your  reature clipping his Power and finding fault with his  onduct For my part  if I were a King I would sooner  give a Man that dislik'd my Title than one who dislik'd my Conduct    Whig  Why then Mr  Tory  you would be none of the  sest Princes For he who finds fault with your Conduct may be your Friend but he who finds fault with your Title must be your Enemy or else a Knave and acts against his Conscience But how does this Article appear of the  Whigs  being dissatify'd with the King's Conduct in any point but in his employing you and the Consequences of it Is it from giving chearfully whatever  ums were demanded in Parliament Is it being ready to advance Mony upon the most remote Funds in offering their Persons to the Publick Service in all times of Danger notwithstanding all Browbeatings and Discouragements by breaking all Measures with King  James  and  is Party that they discover their Dislike and Dissatis  ction to the King or his Government But if they  isapprove that the Friends of King  James  should be King  William  's Ministers that those should be plac'd in all Offices who hate him and betray him will he have reason to take their Dislike of this part of his Conduct so very unkindly from them as to forgive it less than your re  ouncing his Right and Title to the Crown But you  Tories  have got a Trick of bringing Kings into your Quarrels as the Priests do God Almighty into theirs and  by placing them before you hope to make your selve  safe not caring how much you expose them and you im+pudently place your own Crimes unfairly upon others and whilst you your selves are daily libelling and lampoo+ning the King's Person and Conduct most maliciously and triumphing in all his Misfortunes ingratefully witnes  the publick Insolences at the  Bath  and  Windsor  upon th  late Defeat in  Flanders  you according to your wonte  Modesty charge the  Whigs  with your own Faults and a+void being Criminals by turning Accusers  Tory  I know not what some hotheaded drunken Me  may have said and done at the  Bath  or elsewhere b  this I know that a whole Party ought not to share th  Miscarriages of some few particular Men  Whig  You are in the right if that were the case b  it is undeniable that this Insolence is universal and eve  amongst those of you employ'd and paid by the Go+vernment  Tory  This is a sore place I find you are ever complain+ing of But why are you angry with us for being i  Places Did we seek them Were we not sought cou  +ted intreated to accept of Employments And sinc  you provoke me I'll tell you the reason The King foun  none of you  Whigs  capable of or fit for Business he sa  you too of a sour morose Temper jealous of Prerogativ  affecting Popularity childishly fond of Trifles and t  +nacious of lawless Liberty whilst we are frank and ea  in all these matters and know the respect that is due t  Crown'd Heads  Whig  That is when they are rightful  Tory  Come you will make no Prince have the wor  Opinion of us for that  The Right Line Passive Obedien  and  Nonresistance Prerogative  c will always sound we  in every King's Ear And when he considers us Enemi  to his Title only out a Principle of Loyalty he will hav  reason rather to accuse his own Misfortune than o  Vertue we plainly and honestly told him our Principle  that we believ'd him a King  de facto  only and our H  +nour in this point made him rely upon our Honour  others  Whig  Let us examine then how honourably how grat  +fully you have behav'd your selves to a King who ha  rely'd on you and oblig'd you so extremely We will pa  by those who refuse to swear Allegiance to him on th  foremention'd honourable Pretences and only mentio  those who have accepted Employments of Profit and Trus  Have not even those in the Government both in  Englan  and  Scotland  been plotting the Dethroning this King who has trusted them so generously and courted them so  indly Particularly did not one of your Party at the beginning of this Government give notice to the King's Enemies of Warrants against them in order to their making their escape and was discharg'd his Employment upon it Did not a Brother of a certain Secretary give but blank Passes under the Hand and Seal of that Secretary by which a Correspondence was carry'd on betwixt this Place and  France  securely And was not this Gentleman on this account laid aside gently and privately and this matter huddled up for fear of any Reflection on our Monarchical Favourites and put on the Publick as Passes forg'd as indeed they were by our own Officers and a lame Proclamation put out with Rewards to the Discoverer but without a Pardon for Life when they knew the whole matter beforehand Have not some Women lately been taken going to  France  with Letters  o King  James  with a  Scotish  Secretary's Pass under his Hand and Seal Was not an Officer of the PostOffice  ately found corresponding with  France  and without any other Punishment for his Capital Crime laid aside gently and privately The Story of Captain  John Layton  late Commander of the  St Albans  and which has been told  n the House of Commons will shew you how faithfully  ou  Tories  serve the Government and how fit you are  o be trusted Captain  Layton  being order'd to cruise twenty Leagues off  Ʋshant  by a Storm of Wind was driven to Cape  Clear  where he met a  French  Privateer and took her The Captain of the Privateer ask'd  Layton  the Name of his Ship which he told him upon this the Privateer looking into his PocketBook ask'd  Layton  how he came there for by his Intelligence the Station of the  St Albans  was to be twenty Leagues from  Ʋshant  and no further And the like Story is told of a TransportShip going to  France  with Prisoners some few Months ago who meeting with divers Privateers ask'd them how they durst be so bold as to cruise there when four  English  Men of War were within six Leagues of them they reply'd they knew the Station of those  English  and that they could not come where they were a cruising but by breaking their Orders But the relation of the Sailor who was taken and for some time serv'd aboard an  Irish  Privater is yet more remarkable for he deposeth That they told him three Months before the  Straits  Fleet fail'd from  Spithead  both the time when they were to sail the number of their Convoy and likewise  that the main Fleet was to go no further than beyo  Ʋshant  Now how they could come by this Intelligenc  but from Officers imploy'd by and sworn to the Gover  +ment I know not and if so how faithfully and hono  +rably you  Tories  serve those who trust you and how  you are to be imploy'd in this critical Time I appeal  all the World  Tory  These are malicious Stories and if strictly e  +quir'd into will prove false I dare say  Whig  Whenever there is a Committee of indiffere  Men order'd to take the Examination I am inform  all this will be prov'd and much more and how rea+sonable it is to expect this and any other Treachery fro  you will appear probable to those who see you in a  Offices daily and publickly drinking King  James  's Health  who see one Clerk going to a nonswearing Doctor t  take Advice whether he may serve the Government a  a writing Clerk without Damnation to his Soul Ye  replies the Doctor for thereby you keep out an i  Man and may serve your rightful King upon occasion To see another Clerk valuing himself to his Compa+nions that his Place thank God does not oblige him to take the Oaths to the Government To see Officer  of the greatest Trust in the Admiralty in Clubs twic  a Week with Mr  Pps  Mr  Ewrs  and othe  known  Jacobites  and from Saturday to Monday constantly living with them Night and Day  Tory  I know who you mean one of them is a Nephew to one of the Gentlemen and expects  l  from him▪ and would you have him renounce such an Expectance i  consideration of your Place  Whig  No but I would have the Government renounce such an Officer that had such an Expectation from such an Uncle  Tory  But where could you get such able Officers if these were discharg'd  Whig  As the Case stands one honest Man will be of more service than ten such able Men The Forms of Business will be quickly learn'd and want of Experience will be less fatal to us than want of Fidelity Most of the UnderPlaces require a very indifferent Understanding and little Experience to carry on the Business And if you ascend to the Ministry I cannot help thinking my Lord  Shy  or Sir  J Td  as able Secretaries as the E of  N  and Mr  Rll  as able an Admiral as Mr  K  c What is it your able Men have done for us pray these four Years Was  ever any Government in so promising a Condition as ours was at the time of the Revolution Were we not the Hopes of all our Allies and the Terrour of our Enemies And is not the case alter'd with us I fear it is To be plain a Ministry from  Wapping  could not have made worse work on't than yours have done Ministers who know not so much as what Mony their Affairs will require but ask the Parliament too little and manage it so as to make it less That want Intelligence so much that Matters of the greatest Consequence have been publick in every Coffeehouse three Days before it comes to the Secretary's Office particularly the loss of our Merchants Fleet and beating our Army in  Flanders  As if as one said Secretaries like Cuckolds were to know their Dishonour and Misfortunes last Then the Return of our Fleets for want of Provisions laying out Mony in false Expeditions and  anting it thereby in true Necessities imperfect Or  rs from whence proceeds imperfect Execution and  sides they prove an Excuse to Officers even in the  ost fatal Miscarriages with a thousand more Misma  gements and Treacheries from the top to the bottom of the Ministry too tedious to relate here  Tory  And do you think the Government would be  tter serv'd at this time by Novices and Strangers to  usiness  Whig  I have answer'd you that before I think it would be much better serv'd by ignorant Friends than understanding Enemies tho I am far at the same time from granting you that Point for I am sure there are more Men of Sense and Capacity to be found amongst the  Whigs  than amongst the  Tories  and that Experience is not of such mighty Consequence as you would infer will appear if you will please to call to mind the Men employ'd in Publick Affairs by  Cromwel  Was ever Government better serv'd than his and yet he chose Men of the most private Condition and one would have thought most unqualify'd for Publick Business Taylors Draymen broken Shopkeepers raw Scholars and some few of the middling Gentry But being careful to chuse Men principled against the Government of King  Charles  and zealous for the Interest of the Government then on foot they did Wonders supported their Friends and were awful to their Enemies and this with all the Nobility Gentry and Clergy both Church of  England  and Presbyterian in perpetual Combinations and Conspiracies against them at home and a War in  Ireland  Scotland Holland  and  Spain  too upon their hands  you have an Instance of it in this Government in  Person of one of your Secretaries of  Scotland  who  bred in a very private way has shew'd himself a  successful Statesman and of great consequence to  Welfare of the King's Affairs in that Country and  merely from his incorruptible Honesty Zeal and Integ  to the present Government without Experience or g  Insight into Business  Tory  I must grant there is something in what  say Union and Integrity will do great Matters  you  Whigs  cannot pretend to this for you are not  of you in the same mind you have no Governme  no Discipline in your Party no Firmness to one a  +ther or to any Point Your great  P Fy  t  Cadet and carries Arms under the General of the  Saxons  the two  Harys  Father and Son are En  +neers under the late Lieutenant of the Ordnance a  bomb any Bill which he has once resolv'd to red  to Ashes tho it were for Recognition or any thi  else that is most necessary to our Security Your  J  S  and  Jack G  whenever they touch Penny will to  Pot too and drink all in the Bowl be it ever  deep And besides this you are always laughing  spising or railing at one another some of you are t  wise some of you too witty and some of you too  +nest for the rest jealous and envious of one anothe  Favour and Preferment every Man thinking hims  fittest to be at the Head of Affairs and hating and  flecting upon those who are so and despising to be  vern'd or directed by them And at the same ti  those who are at the top disdaining to look down upo  those below them tho they were the steps by whi  they did ascend they grow stately to their Frien  and unmindful of their Fortunes impatient of Address  hard of Access huddling into little Cabals where th  are wise and witty among themselves Whilst we  To  on the contrary have but one Heart one Voice o  Purse and one Interest excuse and justify one anothe  Faults prefer the meanest Fool or Knave of our Pa  +ty and in return the Underlings are every Man in  perfect Obedience to his Superior to vote rail write  talk according to Direction and not otherwise  Whig  I own there is too much Truth in what y  say and you speak Truth so seldom that we ought  allow it you when you do But I hope we have seen t  Error of our Disunion and shall mend it for the futur  however we may have had personal Differences  likewise may have been too much divided and too  inate in some Opinions yet still in all Times and  er all Discouragements we have all agreed to the  e end  viz  the Publick Good of our Country and  Support of its Laws and Liberties and in this pre  t Reign have been and are unanimous against King  mes  and his Interest and have at all times with one  nsent own'd his present Majesty Rightful and Law  which I take to be the  Shibboleth  to distinguish  se who are alone fit to serve this Government And  there be an Act of Recognition in force I will be  d to say all the other Steps of our ablest and ho  stest Statesmen will be upon boggy Ground nor can  y Man be reasonably employ'd in any Office who  s not taken this Test for whoever thinks King  Wil  m  not rightful must think King  James  is so and the  me Conscience which leads them to believe him right  l will incline them to assist that Right when they  ve opportunity But to return to the Point of your  harge we must confess likewise that we have not been  much under the Government of our Superiours as  ou are nor so industrious in supporting each other's  ivate and particular Interests But to the first I  ight answer That Fools and Beggars are more easily  d by the Nose than Men of Sense and Estates  nd as to the latter I must put you in mind that  e Societies of  Ignatius  and of  Newgate  are both of  hem as much united as you in universal Mischief  r Roguery makes a stronger Glew and Cement than  ertue because there are more Men capable of the  ormer than of the latter And tho it were to be  ish'd that the  Whigs  were more friendly and had more  oncern for the Support of one another in all their ho  est Pretences yet God forbid there should ever be such  Friendship and Partiality amongst them as to con  emn and disgrace those who gain Victories because  hey are not of their Party and to support and de  nd those who have lost the Ships Trade and Honour of the Nation because they are their Creatures But on the other side where it is without offence to Justice and the Publick Interest all Unanimity and Friendship  to be admir'd prais'd and pray'd for and I hope you  ill find it amongst us for the future till it becomes  he Subject of your Envy instead of being an occasion of  eproach To put an end to this Argument 'Tis plain  ith all your Friendships and Union  nd other Politicks  you have brought the Nation and all its Allies to  lowest Condition both in Power and Reputation  have almost put it out of the Skill of any Condu  recover us and whoever now takes the Administra  of Affairs upon them will be apply'd to the Gov  +ment like Pidgeons to the Feet of dying Men  however to those who are true Lovers of their C  +try no Time seems too late to attempt its Relief  Difficulty so great as to discourage them from endea  +ring it and tho as the Case stands it is more  probable we  may  miscarry under the best Conduct  it is undeniable we  must  miscarry under yours An  I take my leave
