 THE LORD OF THE MANOR A COMIC OPERA AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURYLANE WITH A PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR  LONDON PRINTED FOR T EVANS IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXI  PREFACE  AMONG the many unpleasing cir∣cumstances attending the concealed writer of a dramatic piece and they are more than are apt at first to occur to him it is not one of the least considerable to a liberal mind that other persons become sufferers by his failings Thus while the real Author on one hand has enjoyed the compliment of having the Lord of the Manor ascribed to se∣veral men for whom it is great literary cre∣dit to be mistaken so on the other he has had the pain to see criticism extended from poetical to political principles and made a vehicle for party reflections upon persons who never saw a line of his writing Not only have the erroneous guesses shifted from man to man they have fallen also upon men in a body different scenes have been given to dif∣ferent pens and sometimes these supposed writers have multiplied upon the imagina∣tion 'till they became almost as numerous as the personages of the drama  Perhaps an apology may be due to every man who has been charged with this found∣ling and the more especially as the parent himself means to continue still unknownconfessing ingenuously at the same time that his temptations to break from his con∣cealment far overbalance his discourage∣ments for after duly weighing every de∣fect of fable conduct dialogue c with which the severest critic could tax him what candidate for praise in poetry would not bear the weight tenfold for the sole pride of avowing in his own name the songs which by many respectable judges have been attri∣buted to Mr SHERIDAN  It is unnecessary to trouble the reader with the motives upon which so flattering a gra∣tification is resistedSome of them perhaps are mere peculiarities of temperSuffice it to say that they are such upon the whole as induce this Author to request the few friends who necessarily have been entrusted with his secret not to think themselves at liberty from any thing here said to divulge it For his own part he is desirous so far to satisfy the public curiosity if curiosity re∣mains upon so trifling a subject as to declare that every word in the following Opera is the production of a single person and should a mistake still rest upon any individual it is  fit that the burthen should be made as light as possible by removing some prejudices which have been bevelled unjustly against the  man  whatever may become of others which may have been conceived against the  piece  Be it known then that these scenes were written last summer in the country for mere amusementto relax a mind which had been engaged in more intense applicationand the only view in bringing them upon the stage was a continuation of amusement encou∣raged and enhanced by the reflection that if they were defective in many parts they were harmless in all that although they might not correct the follies they would not offend the morals of the spectators  It could not but be matter of surprise and some pain to a writer intent upon these prin∣ciples to find himself accused of having in∣troduced the character of Captain Trepan for the purpose of impeding the recruiting ser∣vice of the army To be thought a bad Poet is but a common misfortune and it may be borne with temper and in silence but the imputation of being an illintention∣ed citizen requires an answer though in this case it is trusted a short one will suffice  The writer has ever conceived that as to shew the enormous vices of the time in their  utmost deformity ought to be the great end of dramatic satire so in a lesser degree to ex∣pose to ridicule any practice that savoured more of abuse than absolute vice had its use They who think the fallacies and frauds of recruiting dealers about this town necessary evils which ought to be connived at as contributary to the military strength of the nation are ignorant of facts or blind to con∣sequences So little is the writer of that opinion that he has thought it incumbent upon him to restore in print the passages which from apprehension of sudden miscon∣structions and from no other apprehension were omitted in the representation An abler hand might have carried satire on this subject infinitely further not only with a consciousness of doing no harm but also a confidence of doing good Let us suppose for illustrationsake that his Majesty were pleased to command the First Part of King Henry IV and to order all the boxes to be kept for the new Commanders which the policy of the times from the scarcity un∣doubtedly of veterans has placed at the head of corps raising or to be raised and one of the galleries devoted exclusively to the Crimp Cap∣tains and their Subalternsmight not public benefit be united with entertainment by a just exhibition of old Jack Falstaff's levies and  should it happen that any person present in such an audience were conscious of  "  having misused the King's press damnably  "  or from any other cause were  "  ashamed of his raga∣muffins  "  surely he could not but feel grate∣ful for so gentle a hint and we might see effected by wit and mirth a reformation which under a harsh Sovereign might have been thought deserving of direct and exem∣plary reprehension  A more serious defence can hardly be re∣quisite upon this subject after publication of the piece At the Theatre where the atten∣tion naturally and in this instance most de∣servedly has rested much upon the music the public sentiments sincerely meant to be inculcated may have escaped notice but in the closet the writer without a shadow of fear rests his justification from the charge of illwill to the military service upon passages too numerous to be pointed out He might almost say upon every character of the Dramabut particularly upon that of Tru∣more where the two extremes of that pas∣sion which fills or ought to fill every youthful breast is employed to excite mar∣tial ardour in one instance  disappointment  and  despondency  in love are made the motives for enlisting as a private soldier in the other  success  in love the supreme happiness  in human existence is not admitted as an excuse for relinquishing the military service during the exigencies of our country  To disavow the aspersion I have men∣tioned was the principal purpose of this ad∣dress to the candour of the reader but hav∣ing taken up the pen I will venture to offer to his further indulgence a few thoughts upon Opera and particularly that species of it attempted in the ensuing pages  The Opera is a favourite entertainment in all the polite countries of Europe but in none that I know of held subject to the laws of regular Drama There is neither usage nor statute of criticism if I may use that expres∣sion to try it by unless we look for such in some musical code Metastasio though a very respectable stage writer has never been brought to the same bar with Corneille or Racine or any other professors of correct Tragedy The vital principle and very soul of Italian Opera is music and provided it be well maintained in composition and execu∣tion every inconsistency in fable conduct or character is not only always pardoned but often applauded  The French Opera without entering into the disputed points concerning its music or denying the many beautiful passages which may be extracted from its poetry is if possible  more absurd than the Italian in its departure from probability To the powers of sound is added all that decoration machinery beauty and grace can supply to enchant the eye and the fancy and so forcible it must be al∣lowed is their effect that the judgement re∣ceives no shock when tyrants and lovers heroes and peasants Gods and devils are singing and dancing in amicable chorus all together  The reader will go with me in applying every thing yet said to the serious or great Opera Another species but no more of the legitimate family of Comedy than the for∣mer is of Tragedy has been introduced in all the countries I have alluded to In Eng∣land both have been in use in our native language but with very different success I have no hesitation in pronouncing an opi∣nion that the adopting what is called reci∣tative into a language to which it is totally incongruous is the cause of failure in an English serious Opera much oftener than the want of musical powers in the performers In countries where the inflection of voice in recitative upon the stage is little more than what the ear is used to in common discourse the dialogue of the drama is sustained and strengthened by a great compass of tones but in our northern climates in proportion  as the ordinary expression comes nearer mo∣notony recitative or musical dialogue will seem the more preposterous  See Mr Addison upon this subject Spectator N  o  and others of his papers upon the Opera    I will not contend though I have my doubts that it is impossible for genius to in∣vent and for voice to deliver a sort of reci∣tative that the English language will bear But it must be widely different from the Ita∣lian If any specimens can yet be produced of it's having been effected they will be found to consist only of a few lines introductive of the air which is to follow and as such re∣ceived by the ear just as symphony would be Very few serious pieces except Artaxerxes can be recollected upon our Theatre where it has not entirely failed even when assisted by action in Oratorios it is with a few ex∣ceptions and those sustained by accompani∣ment a soporific that even the thunder of Handel's chorusses are hardly loud enough to overcome  There may be enthusiasts in music who will treat the disrelish I have described to want of ear Let ear be understood merely as the organ by which the mind is to receive more or less delight from sublime English verse and I should be happy to see the dis∣pute brought to public issuethe test should be the performance of Alexander's Feast as  now set to music throughout and the per∣formance of that inimitable ode with the songs alone preserved in music and the rest delivered by Mrs Yates without accompa∣niment or other melody than her empha∣tic elocution  I trust that in contending against musical dialogue in English I shall not be under∣stood to think that all music is inapplicable to the higher compositions of our stage On the contrary I am convinced that under judicious management music is capable of giving them effect beyond what our best au∣thors can attain without itmusic can add energy to Shakspeare himself Indignant as an English audience would be to hear King Lear deliver himself in recitative I believe no person who had a heart or taste ever contemplated the mute groupe of Cordelia with the aged parent asleep in her lap and the physician watching by without an en∣crease of sensibility from the soft music which Mr Garrick introduced into that scene The same observation will hold good with respect to the additional horror excited in Macbeth and delight in the Tempest from the judicious use of both song and in∣struments I cannot help quoting another instance of the application of music which I have always thought a happy one At the close of the tragedy of the Gamester when  the distress is raised to such a pitch that lan∣guage fails under it how forcibly is the im∣pression left upon the audience by music accompanying the slow descent of the cur∣tain over the mournful picture How pre∣ferable such a conclusion to the usual one of an actor straddling over dead bodies to deliver a tame moral in tame rhime to the pit in the same breath and often in the same tone in which he is to give out the play But surely no man can be so void of discernment as not to see clearly the difference between recitative and music thus applied the one diverts the attention from sense to sound breaks the propriety and very nerve of our language and by giving to the expression of the passions cadences of which we never heard an example nor can form a concep∣tion in real life destroys that delusion and charm of fancy which makes the situations before us our own and is the essence of dra∣matic representation the other upon the principle of the chorus of the antients serves to excite and to combine attention and emo∣tion and to improve and to continue upon the mind the impressions most worthy to be retained  I am aware that I have entered further into the grave Drama than my subject re∣quired but the digression will be found ex∣cusable in as much as the same doctrine ap∣plies  to comic productions and as it will serve to shorten the trouble of the reader in what I have further to offer  One branch of comic opera which meets with success on our stage is evidently a graft from the Burletta of the Italians and little as I may admire it in general I will venture to say respectively to the writing it is im∣proved in our soil Midas the Golden Pippin and some others considered as pieces of parody and burlesque are much better than any Italian Burletta I know In fact there is in general in the Italian Drama of this name an insipidity mixed with a buffoonery too low to be called farci∣cal which would make the representation insupportable in England were the language understood or attended to in any other view than as the introduction and display of ex∣quisite music  I cannot easily bring myself to allow the higher branch of our Comic Opera to be of foreign extraction From the time the Beg∣gar's Opera appeared we find pieces in prose with songs interspersed so approaching to regular Comedy in plot incident and pre∣servation of character as to make them a di∣stinct species from any thing we find abroadand is it too much to add that the sense wit and humour to be found in some of them are sterling English marks by which we  may claim the species as our own The mu∣sical pieces at Paris upon the Theatre called  Les Italiens  sprung up from the decline of a sort of Drama where half the personages were Italian as was half the language When Harlequin and Argentine grew un∣fashionable such other representations as served best for an hour of mere dissipation succeeded and the light and easy music with which they were accompanied made them very popular But the pieces are either pa∣rodies or founded in general upon materials which would be thought in England too flimzy for any thing but an afterpiece They are composed with an amusing playful∣ness of imagination which runs Love thro' all its divisions and usually contain abun∣dance of very pretty vocal music with a scar∣city of incident and little variety of charac∣ter It is not intended to degrade or depre∣ciate this stile of writing as applicable to a Paris audience it is only meant to state it more widely separate and distinct from the force and spirit of regular comedy than our own They who are unacquainted with the Paris theatre are referred for judgement upon this subject to the Deserter Zemira and Azor and other direct translations and to Daphne and Amintor and Thomas and Sally and other afterpieces very good in their kind but written after the French man∣ner  The Padlock is above this class in dis∣play of characters and the French have no∣thing upon their Musical Comic Stage to compare as resembling  Comedy  with Love in a Village or the Maid of the Mill or to take still greater credit to our Theatre the Duenna  The Lord of the Manor although the leading incident of the story is professedly taken from the Silvain of Marmontel is an humble attempt at the species of Opera which I have ventured to call English and to de∣scribe as a drama the next in gradation below regular Comedy and which might perhaps be carried a step above it It will not there∣fore be thought want of attention to the ex∣cellencies of Marmontel's piece which as adapted to French manners I believe no man of taste will dispute but respect and prefer∣ence to our stage that induced me to alter and enlarge the plan and conduct of the original to substitute characters and to add scenes and circumstances entirely new  I know not a feature of character pre∣served from Marmontel except the sensibi∣lity and artless innocence of the young wo∣menqualities which to be truly repre∣sented admit of little diversity by change of country  I should be sorry if taking part or even the whole of a story from a foreign stage when  such story can be made applicable to our cus∣toms and characters and is entirely new worked up for that purpose could be deemed plagiarism because it would be a confine∣ment to the invention rather pedantick than useful  But while I am taking credit for borrow∣ing so little as one incident there may be those who think I had better have borrowed a great deal more I can only say that translation or imitation would have cost less pains as it is easier to spin  Filer le Sentiment  sentiment than to delineate character and to write twenty songs to please the ear than half as many lines of such Comedy as ought to satisfy the judgement I do not contend that a direct copy of Marmontel would not have been a much better thing than my talents have been able to make I only insist it would no have been English drama Continued uninterrupt∣ed scenes of tenderness and sensibility  Comedie larmoyante  may please the very refined but the bulk of an English audience including many of the best understanding go to a comic performance to laugh in some part of it at least They claim a right to do so upon precedents of our most valued playsand every author owes it to them so long as the merriest amongst them shews he is equal∣ly  capable of relishing and applauding what is elevated and affectingan observation I have always seen hold good in an English gallery  It might be assuming too much to quote any passages from the Lord of the Manor as a test that every part of the house can re∣lish refined sentiment but were the fact ten times more apparent I should still adhere to my former opinion and intermix mirth the censure of a critic of fashion here and there in the boxes who reckon every thing low which is out of their own sphere would never persuade me to turn Moll Flagon out of my piece easy as it would be to conduct the story without her while she excites so much pleasure in general as to prove the character can neither be false in nature nor void of humour  And now a few words upon what I con∣ceive would be the plan of writing were men of genius and taste to try a specimen of correct musical comedy  In a representation which is to hold  "a mirror up to nature"  and which ought to draw its chief applause from reason vocal music should be confined to express the feel∣ings of the passions but never to express the exercise of them Song in any action in which reason tells us it would be unnatural to sing must be preposterous To fight a duel to cudgel a poltroon in cadence may  be borne in a burletta upon the same prin∣ciple that in the serious opera we see heroes fight lions and monsters and sometimes ut∣ter their last struggles for life in song and die in strict time and tune but these liber∣ties would be totally inadmissible in the kind of drama which I am recommending My idea might be further explained by a passage in the piece of Marmontel before re∣ferred to It appeared to one of the news∣paper critics that I had been guilty of a great error in not introducing a scene in the Silvain wherein the  Gardes Chasse  of the Seigneur attack the sportsman with guns in their hands threatening to shoot him un∣less he surrenders his gun which he persists in preserving By the bye this sort of au∣thority is more natural in France than I hope it would  yet  be thought to be in Eng∣land but that was not my principal objec∣tion This scene upon the French stage is all in song and even at Paris where licence of throwing action into song is so much more in use than it is here and where I have often seen it excellently performed the idea of five or six fellows with fusils present∣ed at a gentleman's head and their fingers upon the triggers threatening his life in bass notes he resisting in tenor and a wife or daughter throwing herself between them in treble while the spectator is kept in sus∣pence  from what in reality must be a mo∣mentary event till the composer has run his air through all its different branches and to a great length always gave me disgust to a great degree  Music therefore if employed to express action must be confined to dumb shew It is the very essence of pantomime and we have lately seen upon the opera stage how well a whole story may be told in dance but in all these instances music stands in the place of speech and is itself the only organ to express the sentiments of the actor  To return to the application of vocal music upon the English theatre it must not only be restrained from having part in the exer∣cise or action of the passions care must be also taken that it does not interrupt or de∣lay events for the issue of which the mind is become eager It should always be the  accessory  and not the  principal  subject of the drama but at the same time spring out of it in such a manner that the difference can hardly be discerned and that it should seem neither the one nor the other could be spared  And notwithstanding all these restrictions vocal music judiciously managed would have many occasions to distinguish its own specific charms at the same time that it embellish∣ed  enriched and elevated regular dramatic compositions In tragedy I am convinced the mind would peculiarly feel its powers  Not touch'd but rapt not waken'd but inspir'd  In the humbler but not less instructive line of comedy its office would be to convey through the sweetest channel and to esta∣blish by the most powerful impressions upon the mind maxim admonition sentiment virtue  Should any thing I have said strike a man of genius and taste with the distinction I have endeavoured to establish between comic opera and musical comedy viz between  "elaborate trifles"  made secondary to music and sense and spirit inculcated and sustained by it new subjects could not be wanting to engage their trials or if it occurred to men of that description to try an experiment upon an old subject and a poet could be found courageous enough to engraft upon Shakspeare as has been done upon Milton in Comus perhaps no subject could be found in the whole range of fancy better fitted for musical comedy than the play of "As you like it" Indeed it seems by some songs thrown into the original that it was the idea of the great author himself To multiply the  songs excellent materials might be taken from the piece itself without injury to the eloquent and brilliant passages which are better adapt∣ed to the energy of elocution and action And where materials failed in the original what true votary of the Muse would not find animation and assistance in his inven∣tive faculties from the prospect of being ad∣mitted before the public a companion to Shakspeare  In the mean time the Lord of the Manor has been offered not as an example but an excitement to improve that species of drama  fungar vice cotis acutum  Reddere quae ferrum valet exsors ipse secandi  It would be affectation in me as well as in∣gratitude to the public to deny the pleasure I have had in the very favourable reception of this piece At the same time I trust that I am duly sensible how much of the success is to be attributed to the exertions of the performers the merits of the Orchestra and the excellence of Mr Jackson's composition Among all the circumstances of satisfaction there is not one more pleasing to the reflec∣tion than that the bringing this humble pro∣duction upon the stage has been the means of making me acquainted with a man whose  harmony I sincerely believe to be character∣istic of his mindequal to any exertions but peculiarly exquisite when expressive of the social tender quiet and amiable quali∣ties of the human heart  Before I dismiss this theatrical subject up∣on which I have hazarded many opinions that for aught I know may be singly mine I am free to confess that in calling upon men of genius to try the effect of my ideas I have had my eye particularly upon Mr Sheridan As an author he is above my en∣comium as a friend it is my pride to think we are exactly upon a level From the consideration of him in both those capacities I feel myself more interested than the rest of the world in a performance he has some time given us reason to expect His Muse though without participation of my cause will naturally and of necessity be the advo∣cate of it by verifying and exemplifying true musical comedy and such a sanction from the author whom all respect will be rendered doubly precious to myself by its proceeding also from the man I love  THE AUTHOR  The following elegant Editions are just published by T

was forced to tell him the worst I knew of you  RASHLY  Good Rental what might that be  RENTAL  I told him you had the benevolence of a prince with means little better than a cottager that conse∣quently your family was often indebted to your gun at which you were the best hand in the country for the only meat in your kitchen  RASHLY  But what said he to the gun  RENTAL  He shook his head and said if you were a poacher woe be to you when his son arrived  RASHLY  His son  RENTAL  Yes his only son in fact The eldest it seems was turned out of doors twenty years ago for a mar∣riage
