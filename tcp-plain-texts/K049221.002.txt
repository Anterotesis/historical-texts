Page  Notes  Page  Glossary  Page  A DISSERTATION ON THE COMIC BALLAD  THE pieces here selected under the title of Comic Ballads fall under the several denominations of Pastoral Amatory Ludicrous and Convivial this Dissertation therefore naturally divides itself into these several heads  No subject of critical discussion has been examined with more assiduity and less success than Pastoral composition The French critics whom a writer of any discernment seldom quotes but to confute their absurdities have here blundered with more than or∣dinary address Rapin has found that pastoral writing  must faithfully represent the manners of the golden age Dubos a more judicious writer has discovered that the real dialogues of modern shepherds are too gross for poetic relation he therefore advises a poet who would now venture into this walk of verse to choose for his speakers princes who had lost themselves in a wood He is surely himself lost in a wood of false criticism when he informs us that the first Dialogue of Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds is an excellent Pastoral Eclogue It is no doubt a very fine piece of writing but considered in the light of a Bucolic Po∣em it makes fully as aukward a figure as an ancient River God in a French Opera with a tye wig and silk stockings  Did these writers ever read Theocritus Did they not know that he was the father and his works the only models of this kind of poetry  Of all the poets of antiquity none has been imitated with less success than that excellent writer He would himself appear to be perfectly original for though we read that Homer was indebted for some of his beauties to his poetical predecessors we never find Theocritus lay under this accusation His eclogues breathe the very spirit of nature and surpass those of all his imi∣tators in beauty as much as a romantic river wander∣ing through the richest rural scenes does a Dutch jet∣d'eau  squirting among hedges of clipt yews Virgil who was born an elegiac poet but never happened upon his proper province has in pastoral only displayed excellent skill in versification which is indeed his first and almost only praise in all his works His very persons are ridiculous for what have Thyrsis and Corydon to do with the Po An absurdity followed by the whole imitators of this imitator and among others by Pope who gravely makes Alexis sing upon the banks of the Thames His admired French author Boileau might have told him that Truth alone is fair and lovely To confound the  names  of different climates and ages must to every reader of taste appear fully as ludicrous as to confound places and dates in defiance of geography and chronology Who but must smile if he read that Theocritus was born at the Devil tavern in the Strand at Paris in the year of Christ and had the honour to recite one of his eclogues before that merry prince Charles I of England who was so pleased with it that he cut three capers of a most surprising height to the amazement of the bard and afterwards made him a present of a lottery ticket Yet this is not more absurd than to mingle names places and subjects that are perfectly heterogeneous as is done in Pope's pastorals which are very much inferior to them of Philips though Phillips has no  claim to praise The fact is that pastoral eclogue is quite foreign to modern manners Those of The∣ocritus appear natural from their antiquity and from his inimitable language and manner but he stands alone and ever will  Any eclogues that occur in this collection such as  Robene and Makyne  c are of a lyric nature and may with much more propriety be called songs than eclogues though they partake of the manner of both I there∣fore leave the pastoral eclogue to come to the pastoral song or ballad a species of composition which though not very remote in its essence from the pastoral dialogue is infinitely more consonant to modern man∣ners as it implies no personal representation It is not supposed to be written or spoken by a shepherd but merely to convey rural sentiments and images  Dubos tells us that the peasants of Italy at this day go to keep their flocks or labour the ground with their guitar on their backs and that they sing their loves in extempore verses which they accompany with their instrument This they call  Improvisadare  This practice of making extempore verses is frequent in Italy as we may observe in many of the latest travellers But I suppose the principal merit of such poetry arises from the surprize of the hearer The works of Barnardino Per∣fetti a Patrician of Sienna  Firenze  now lie before me He was the best of modern extemporary poets and crowned in the capitol yet there is nothing in them  Were  any of these songs to be committed to writing and of high merit it might be considered as a pastoral song complete in every circumstance  Yet I question if in truth of character it could exceed some of the pieces of that kind now under our eye though written perhaps in the smoke and noise of a capital But to pass from this theory many of the Scotish songs now selected must be allowed by every good judge to have uncommon excellence in the pastoral mode of poetry They possess the utmost truth of manner and of colouring They have all that sweetness which an ancient critic    Hermogenes l  II  c    observes is the result of perfect simplicity As most of the Pastoral pieces in this Selection are likewise of the Amatory style I shall proceed to consider these kinds of poetry in conjunction  If the antiquity of the different kinds of poetry were properly ascertained it is to be believed that love poetry would be found among those of the first inven∣tion Love that sweetest and best of passions is ever the inspirer of poetry Love is a master that can call forth musical sounds from the heart of the savage of Iceland amid his half year's wintry night as well as from that of the exulting inhabitant of Arabia the  happy under the influence of the summer sun His effects are controlled by no manner of life and con∣fined by no zone In the most barbarous countries Love will be found the inspirer of sentiment and re∣finer of thought and of language  Spirero nobil sensi a rozzi petti  Raddolciro delle lor lingue il suono  As Love is perhaps the father of poetry  Plato loq de Amore  so it is observed that the fair objects and best judges of that passion have always esteemed it the most complete triumph of their charms when their lovers are so en∣flamed as to commence poets in their praise Amorous poetry has often been the supposed  magic charm  that has caught the heart of the fair novice in that passion This has not escaped Shakspere that anatomist of the heart  My gracious Duke  This man has witched the bosom of my child  Thou thou Lysander thou hast  given her rhymes  And stolen th' impression of her fantasy  With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits  Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers  Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth  Midsummer Nights Dream  If we except Sappho the only female who ever wrote any thing worth preservation there is no writer who has painted love in more genuine and tender co∣lours than are used in the Scotch Amatory Ballads Yet there are none of them that I remember are written by ladies  There is indeed of very late years one insignificant exception to this rule  Auld Robin Gray  having got his silly psalm set to soporific music is to the credit of our taste popular for the day But after lulling some goodnatured audiences asleep he will soon fall asleep himself  That profligacy of manners which always reigns before women can so utterly forget all sense of decency and propriety as to commence authors is yet almost unknown in Scotland May it ever be so May domestic duties and affections be ever the sole employments and amusements of my fair countrywomen while those of other kingdoms are showing themselves naked in love songs and romances or stalking the streets in the breeches of criticism and morality  The love verses in this volume are of almost every different hue incident to that changeable passion but a plaintive tenderness is the more general characteristic of them Fielding I think has observed that love is generally accompanied by a pleasing melancholy The songs in this collection called  Lochaber Ewbuchts Ma∣rion Low down in the broom  and many others have  when accompanied witn their proper airs a most ex∣quisite pathos  They yield a very echo to the seat  Where Love is throned  Others again possess an equal power of sprightliness such as  An thou wert my ain thing Soger Ladie O'er the Bogie  c which do not yield to the best French songs in spirit though these are likewise excellent in their kind Indeed if the French excel in any species of poetry it is in their songs though their best efforts in this way do not seem much known in England As this is the case and it is perfectly coherent with my subject I shall beg leave to present my reader with a few French songs of the first merit  In the serious style here is one never yet published  Il faut attendre avec patience  Le jour de demain c'est un beau jour  Grande est diton la difference  Entre le marriage et l'amour  Quoi Le contrat qui nous engage  Change quelque chose a notre humeur  Il faut que j'aimois davantage  Si je juge d'apres mon coeur  Si je juge d' apres mon coeur  Quand Louis me dit 'Ma Louise  'Je t'aime et n'aimerois que toi'  Sans le vouloir il faut que je dise  'Je t'aime cent fois plus que moi'  Il me jure amour eternel  Et Louis n'est pas un menteur  Il me sera toujours fidel  Si je juge d'apres mon coeur  Si je juge d'apres mon coeur  Quel sujet aurois je de craindre  Mon amant devient mon mari  Je n'aurois jamais a m'en plaindre  C'est l'Amour qui me l'a choisi  Je suis aimé autant que j'aime  Rien ne gatera mon bonheur  Et toujours il sera le meme  Si je juge d' apres mon coeur  Si je juge d'apres mon coeur  Others follow  Solitaire temoin de ma secrette peine  Echo qui soupires avec moi dans ces bois  Zephir vous fait il quelque fois  Repeter le nom de Climeine  Je voudrois lui cacher le trouble de mon coeur  Mais s'il repond a ma tendress extreme  Cher confident de ma sincere ardeur  Echo dites lui que je l'aime  Echo Echo dites lui que je l'aime  Murmurez charmans ruisseaux  Mais gardez vous de troubler par vos eaux  Le doux sommeil de la jeune Sylvie  Qui s'est endormie  Au chant des oiseaux  Votre onde qui s'enfuit  Dans ce vallon fait un peu trop de bruit  Charmans ruisseaux  He qu'ai je dit  Non non roulez precipitez vos flots  La cruelle qu'elle est m'ote bien ce repos  Ah que ces demeures sont belles  Que nous y passons de beaux jours  Ah que ces demeures sont belles  Que nous y passons d'heureux jours  Quelle felicité pour les amans fidelles  Ici les amours eternelles  Ont toujours la douceur des nouvelles amours  Ah que ces demeures sont belles  Les frimats ont cessé le printems va paroitre  Tout renait tout fleurit dans ces aimables lieux  Ah si ma liberté pouvoit ainsi renaitre  Que je serois heureux que je serois heureux  Taisez vous ma Musette  Nos chants ne sont plus doux  Vous n'avez pu toucher Lisette  Helas de quoi me servez vous  These shall be succeeded by a few Amatory French songs in the sprightly style  Vous qui faites votre modelle  De la constante tourterelle  Que je vous plains dans vos amours  Pour moi j'imite l'hirondelle  Sans que rien arrete mon cours  Je vole ou le printems m'appelle  N'oubliez pas votre houlette  Lisette  Quand vous irez au bois  Le berger dont vous faites choix  Est trop libertin sur l' herbette  N'oubliez pas votre houlette  Lisette  Quand vous irez au bois  Bon vin  Belle Sylvie  Plaisirs les plus grands de la vie  C'est vous qui reglez mon destin  Je m'attache a vous suivre  Enfin pourvu que je m'enyvre  N'importe que ce soit ou d'amour ou de vin  Aimez aimez puis qu'il faut  L'amant qui vous engage  Ce n'est pas un grand defaut  Q'un peu d'amour a votre age  Ah le tems d'etre sage  Ne viendra que trop tot  Aimez puis qu'il le faut  Ah le tems d'etre sage  Ah le tems d'etre sage  Ne viendra que trop tot  In the Ludicrous style the following may be ac∣ceptable  Quand il tonne et que ere Pierre  Court a la cave se cacher  Court a la cave se cacher  Vous croyez qu'il fuit le tonnere  C'est le tonneau qu'il va chercher  C'est le tonneau qu'il va chercher  Chloris et le tabac j'estime  De tous deux je me sens epris  Tous deux regnent sur mes esprits  De tous deux je suis le victime  Mais s'il faut ceder au plus fort  Chloris je n'aurai point de tort  De quitter l' ardeur qui me pique  Vos yeux me donnent le trepas  Mais dans le flambeau de ma pipe  J'eteins celui de vos appas  Depuis huit jours que je brule pour vous  N'avez vous pas assez eprouvé ma constance  Et ne devez vous pas un traitement plus doux  A ma perseverance  A votre tour laissez vous enflamer  Aujourdhui belle Iris faites fuier ma peine  Et je vous jure de vous aimer  Encore une semaine  Un jour un vieux hibou  Se mit dans la cervelle  D'epouser une hirondelle  Jeune et belle  Dont l'Amour l'avoit rendu fou  Il pria les oiseaux de chanter a la fete  Tout s'enfuit en voyant une si laide bete  Il n'y resta que coucou coucou coucou  To conclude with a few Convivial ones the follow∣ing are given  Si tu veux etre sans chagrin  Bois comme il faut de ce bon vin  La bouteille  Fait merveille  C'est un secours qui est tout divin  Verses du vin  Verse donc du plus fin  Verse toujours soir et matin  Doux sommeil endormes les amans miserables  Ils ont besoin de vos faveurs  Ne verses que sur eux vos pavots favorables  Gardes vous d'assoupir de fortuné buveurs  Laissez au dieu de la bouteille  Le soin de remplir notre sort  Lors que Bacchus seul nous endort  Jamais l'Amour ne nous reveille  The following is equal to any thing written by Anacreon  Est il un sort plus triste que le mien  Je meprisois l'Amour je bravois sa puissance  Et content d'une heureuse indifference  J'avois toujours tremblé de me laisser charmer  Je sens enfin que je m'en vais aimer  Ah je m'en vais aimer  Mais c'est toi ma bouteille  C'est toi charmant jus de la treille  Que j'aimerai toujours je t'en donne ma foi  Et je n'aurai jamais de maitresse que toi  But to return I must not quit this subject without offering a few remarks on the principal scene of the Scotish pastoral songs namely the southern part of Scotland in the neighbourhood of the Tweed I can∣not do this better than in the words of an excellent writer He forms a fine contrast by beginning with a description of the Northern parts of Scotland  The highlands of Scotland says he are a picturesque but in general a melancholy country Long tracts of mountainous desert covered with dark heath and often obscured by misty weather narrow vallies thinly inhabited and bounded by precipices resound∣ing with the fall of torrents a soil so rugged and a climate so dreary as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the la∣bours  of agriculture the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that intersect the country the portentous noises which every change of the wind and every increase and diminution of the wa∣ters is apt to raise in a lonely region full of echoes and rocks and caverns the grotesque and ghastly appearance of such a landscape by the light of the moonObjects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy which may be compatible enough with oc∣casional and social merriment but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and solitude  And a little further he ob∣serves  that the ancient highlanders of Scotland had hardly any other way of supporting themselves than by hunting fishing or war professions that are continually exposed to fatal accidents And hence no doubt additional horrors would often haunt their solitude and a deeper gloom overshadow the imagi∣nation even of the hardiest native  He proceeds  What then would it be reasonable to expect from the fanciful tribe from the musicians and poets of such a region Strains expressive of joy tranquillity or the softer passions No Their style must have been better suited to their circumstances And so we find in fact that their music is The wildest ir∣regularity appears in its composition the expression  is warlike and melancholy and approaches even to the terribleAnd that their poetry is almost uni∣formly mournful and their views of nature dark and dreary will be allowed by all who admit of the authenticity of Ossian and not doubted by any who believe these fragments of highland poetry to be ge∣nuine which many old people now alive of that country remember to have heard in their youth and were then taught to refer to a pretty high an∣tiquity  Some of the Southern provinces of Scotland pre∣sent a very different prospect Smooth and lofty hills covered with verdure clear streams winding through long and beautiful valleys trees produced without culture here straggling or single and there crowding into little groves and bowers with other circumstances peculiar to the districts I allude to render them fit for pasturage and favourable to ro∣mantic leisure and tender passions Several of the old Scotch songs take their names from the rivulets villages and hills adjoining to the Tweed near Mel∣rose a region distinguished by many charming va∣rieties of rural scenery and which whether we consider the face of the country or the genius of the people may properly enough be termed the Arcadia of Scotland And all these songs are sweetfully and  powerfully expressive of love and tenderness and other emotions suited to the tranquillity of pastoral life  Essays by Dr Beattie d edit Essay I    Thus far this eminent philosopher and poet whose ideas are so fully expressed and so consonant with my own that they leave me little or nothing further to add I must however observe that the genuine Old Songs which were originally set to the most ad∣mired of the Scotish airs are most of them unfor∣tunately lost For the present words to the greater part of them we are indebted to Allan Ramsay and his friends as he himself informs us in the fol∣lowing words of the preface to his Teatable Miscel∣cellany or Collection of Songs  My being well as∣sured how acceptable new words to known good tunes would prove engaged me to the making verses for above SIXTY of them in this and the second vo∣lume  which are Scotish songs the third and last volume containing mostly English  about THIRTY more were done by some ingenious young gentlemen  I heartily wish honest Allan and his ingenious young gentlemen had rather used their endeavours to recover and preserve the real ancient ballads than to compose new ones For uncouth as those might be I much  suspect they exceeded their substitutes in variety at least Indeed as I meant this as a POETICAL not as a MUSICAL work I found myself obliged to admit only the best of these modern pieces always prefering the ancient when it could be found Those who wish for words to all the Scotish airs may find them in many collections This only means to present the reader of taste with the very best of Scotish ballad poetry The reader whom I could wish to please would turn with contempt from a constant succession of the same ideas expressed in the same words and stanza For though the airs vary their verbal accom∣paniments have in general a similarity as disgusting as the poems of Blackmore or the pictures of Angelica Kauffman Though the ancient songs were perhaps less smooth than their successors they were doubtless more varied being composed at distant periods by different minstrels than they could possibly be by Allan Ramsay a writer not rich in ideas and his young friends who perhaps begun and finished their labours in this way in the space of a few weeks And if they were harsh or uncouth the ancient composer might plead with Tasso  se ben miri  Molle e dura e costei  Cosi son duri e molli i versi miei  Molle e in lei quel di fuori  Dentro ha marmi e diaspri  Sol nella scorza i versi miei son aspri  Ma senti come spiri  Da loro interni amori  Spirto gentil ch' intenerisce i core  A very celebrated and intelligent physician who was born and passed his early years in the south of Scotland informs me that it is his opinion that the best of the ancient Scotish airs were really composed by shepherds In his remembrance there was in al∣most every village of that district a chief shepherd who had acquired celebrity by composing better songs than others of the same profession And he thinks that though the best airs are in general known yet the words to at least one half have never been published The musical instruments used by these rude minstrels are the common flute and the  stockandhorn  which is a flute with a small horn fastened to the further end of it and which forms a  base  in the nature of a bassoon  The beginning of one of their unpublished ballads of the mournful kind he happens to remember It was written on the fatal expedition to Darien in the end of last century a project that seems to have been  formed for the destruction of the Scotish youth and opens with the following most striking couplet  We'll a awa to the woods and murne  Untill our Scotish joes come hame  I believe not above half a dozen of these genuine Scotish pastoral ballads are in print and suspect all such may be found in this volume They have certain strokes in them which in my opinion could only occur to real shepherds Such are  The yellowhair'd laddie Ewbuchts Marion In simmer I maw'd my meadow  c What a sad exchange to give such songs for the poor tinsel of Allan Ramsay and his bottle companions  There is a book printed at St Andrews in called  The Complaint of Scotland  It is written by a Sir James Inglis and is of such exceeding rarity as to be almost unique but Dr George Mackenzie in his Lives of Scotish Writers has given us an abstract of it The author mentions a masque and enumerates the following songs as forming part of the entertain∣ment    The briers binds me sair    Still under the leyvis grene    Coutbume the rashis grene    Allace I vyt your twa feyr ene    Goete you gude day vit boy    Lady help your prisoneir    King Williams Note    The lange no wee nou    The Cheapel Valk    Fay that

an knight    Allace the samen sueit face    In an myrthfou Morrou my hart levit on the lad  This list which is of exceeding curiosity may teach us that not one of our Scotish popular airs is so ancient as Indeed I suspect these of which the scene lyes in the south of Scotland as  Tweedside  c are all of them posterior to the accession of James VI to the throne of England Any of the above songs that have local marks belong to the Northern parts of Scotland and it is to be supposed that the provinces which first felt the blessings of repose would first break out into finging Not above two of the pieces in this list are now known If I do not mistake numbers and or something like them may be found in  Smith's Songs in score before the year  They are English songs and prove the author has intermingled English airs with those of his own country I am told No used lately to be sung on the stage at Edinburgh and contains a mock courtship between a frog and a mouse of some satyrical merit  Some few of the modern songs have the merit of being written on real occasions and such always speak  the language of the heart a language of difficult simulation Some of such yield not to the Elegies of Tibullus in nature and pathos though that ancient poet is a wonderful master in Amatory verse Ham∣mond has never caught his spirit except in imitations which are so close as to be almost translations but I have lately had the pleasure of seeing some Elegies of this kind in manuscript which rival those of Tibullus himself  The most ancient pieces in this selection are of the LUDICROUS style of poetry which is something sur∣prising as that species of writing has been thought by able crities to be an effort of modern refinement It is true the images given us in the Scotish Ludicrous pieces are often not the most agreeable or delicate but have the most modern writers Swift for example been more laudable in this respect In  Peblis to the Play Christ's Kirk on the Green  and others the reader will find curious descriptions of low life and manners as they were in Scotland in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the more curious as they were drawn by the hands of monarchs themselves It is certainly much to the credit of the united kingdoms that while the poets of the other countries of Europe were writing extravagant romances Chaucer and the princely bards of Scotland were employed in delineating real life and manners  In the  Wyfe of Auchtermuchty  and similar productions here given there is abundance of humour though a critic of fashion may perhaps pronounce it  low  But  t is NATURE and will ever be so Had Chaucer only written or rather translated the  Romaunt of the Rose  his works might now have been fast asleep in some old chest but his  ales  replete with humour of the lower kind will perpetuate his fame That father of Eng∣lish poetry appears to have been as much esteemed in Scotland as in his native country Dunbar the chief of the Scotish poets has in his  Goldin Terge  the following spirited apostrophe in his praise which is highly generous if we consider the inveterate enmity at that time subsisting between the two kingdoms It proves that the pursuit of poetry is productive of large and liberal sentiments even in a barbarous period  O reverend Chawser rose of rethouris all  As in oure toung ane flour imperial  That raise in Brittane evir quha reidis richt  Thou beiris of makars the triumphs royal  Thy fresche ennamalit termes celestial  This mater couth haif illuminit full bricht  Was thou nocht of our Inglis all the licht  Surmounting every toung terestrial  As far as Mayis morrow dois midnicht  Chaucer may indeed be regarded as the father not only of English poetry but of that remarkable quality of writing called  humour  a word which I believe has no corresponding term in any language as we have none for the French  naïveté  for they are distinct ideas  Naïveté  if I mïstake not only implies a  na∣tive gaiety an unconscious simplicity  and is never used in a synonymous sense with  humour  which implies something characteristic even though  severe  or  morose  as we say a  humourous gravity  Fontaine has  naïveté  Chaucer has hu∣mour Wit is an assimulation of distant ideas Humour is confined to  manner  either of speaking or writing  It has been affirmed by some eminent critics that the moderns much excel the ancients in witty and hu∣mourous composition and alledged that the ancients have no writers in these kinds to oppose to Don Quixote Hudibras The Splendid Shilling the Adventures of Gil Blas The Tale of a Tub and the Rehearsal  Adventurer No The reader will smile at the works here enumerated when he thinks on the omission of those of Shakspere Fielding and Smollet the last of whom was a writer of the most genuine humour that ever existed  But in this they did not reflect that they only saw one side of the question The fact is that with is the most fleeting and transitory quality writing can have Like an exquisite essence it wastes itself and leaves  only the vase that contained it The Margites of Homer I suspect began like Hudibras in our time to cease being understood before it was allowed to perish But the argument I would use is in short that we cannot judge of the efforts of the ancients in this way because their best works are lost Surely then to pro∣nounce against them when they cannot be heard in their defence is not candid It must however be allowed that the modern Novel descriptive of real life and the most useful kind of writing known when properly conducted appears to have been fo∣reign to ancient conception But it appears to me very evident that the human mind in the progress of ages alters its shape and powers if I may so express myself In the days of Greece and Rome its criterion would seem to have been strength in modern times ver∣satility aud acuteness Hence the dignity and grandeur of their writings and the wit and precision of ours Reasons might be given for the difference but this is not the proper place  As we have seen Chaucer was so much regarded by the ancient Scotish poets I suppose it was from him they took their ideas of burlesque descriptions of vulgar life  The CONVIVIAL songs in this Selection are not many I shall not therefore insist on this head It may however be observed that considering how much the French have written in this way it is something strange their ancient allies the Scots should have been so barren in this very easy mode of composition One would imagine the juice of the grape that inspired Anacreon was equally potent in his numerous French imitators while the Scots having little of that liquid inspiration were by ale confined in the bands of sleep at the social hour that gave the French  bons vivants  free access to the regions of fancy  It may perhaps be expected that before closing this essay I should offer some remarks on Scotish Music a subject of much interest and curiosity to every lover of that best sort of melody which speaks to the heart and passions But the ingenious author of an essay on Scotish Music annexed to Mr Arnot's History of Edinburgh has left me nothing to add on that head Dr Beattie has likewise treated this subject more briefly but with his usual elegance and ability in his Essay on Poetry and Music as they affect the Mind Another good writer  Dr Gregory in his Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man with those of the Animal World  has likewise dropt a few re∣marks on this matter Both these eminent authors  have used many arguments to confute the opinion of those who ascribe to David Rizzio the invention of our Scotish melodies an idea that like many heresies is only made important by its opponents for it carries absurdity and confutation in itself  I am informed that some Scotishman has made some stanzas to the favorite Irish air of  Langolce  under the name of  The Banks of the Dee  Such a thest cannot be too severely condemned as if persisted in there is an end of all national music As the Irish air is rather impure had the scene of the new verses been laid in Ireland they might have been innocent enough    I shall therefore conclude with an observation or two respecting the volume now under the reader's eye  He has already been admonished not to look upon this Work as a Collection but as a Selection not as pretending to offer the whole of the Scotish Ballads to his view but only the very best of them The first volume  The second edition is here meant  indeed presents the reader with a complete digest of such tragic pieces yet discovered in the Scotish dialect as any ways deserve preservation those omitted being of no merit of any kind Such are  Johnie Armstrong Young Waters Laird of Ochiltree The Battle of Harlaw The Battle of Raidquair  and others Not to mention  Lord Thomas and fair Annet  which is an English Ballad as well as  Chevy Chace  though some who have not seen Dr Percy's ancient  ballad of this name will still contend for its being Scotish  Such has been the generous impartiality of the minstrel who composed this fine ballad and who perhaps had been entertained with equal attention at Alnwick and at Douglass castles that hardly one intrinsic mark could be given to authorise the ascribing of it to a native of either country till the ancient copy appeared which at once terminated the dispute  An edition printed at Aberdeen has a preface and notes which present the arguments that were then valid for  Chevy chace  being a Scotish composition  The loss of Chevy chace might be compensated to Scot∣land by the recovery of many tragic pieces of no inferior merit were means used by those who have opportunities for that purpose  Bertram the archer  the Robin Hood of Scotland is now hardly known to have existed though he was celebrated in many a heroic ditty The only stanza known to the Editor is given as it closes with a pretty thought Bertram being surrounded by his enemies ad∣dresses his weapons in this manner  My trusty bow of the tough yew  That I in London bought  And silken strings if ye prove true  That my true love has wrought  Of the Scotish Ballads which fall under the title of this second volume I must confess perhaps twenty or thirty more would have been admitted had the limits of the work allowed it Yet here I have to use a vulgar metaphor presented the reader with the cream of about a dozen volumes most of them un∣common in this part of the kingdom The comic  pieces here given are chosen either from their being rare their being unpublished or their intrinsic merit  For the very curious piece which is placed at the head of this volume and now first published I am in∣debted to the friendship of the most learned and in∣genious Editor of the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry  Peblis to the Play  will certainly be looked upon as a very considerable acquisition to ancient Scotish Poetry and will I doubt not gain Dr Percy to whom alone the reader is beholden for it much grate∣ful applause in the Northern part of the kingdom in particular Indeed considerable fame is already due to him who first set the example of a legitimate collec∣tion of this kind than which if conducted with taste nothing can well be more entertaining to the lover of Poetry The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry were only the amusement of his youthful hours of relaxa∣tion from severer studies but might well be called a work of infinite labour and disquisition if executed by a writer of less genius to form a noble plan and less ability to put it in execution For the politeness peculiar to himself with which the communication of this poem was made I now beg leave to offer him my public acknowledgments  Some readers may perhaps think that a few of the pieces in this volume might with equal propriety have been allotted to the first as being of a plaintive or mournful kind In excuse it may be alledged that the melancholy of these productions is not of the deepest shade but such as may with no blame fall in with the present arrangement in the same manner as the best comic writings are interspersed with a few scenes of fugitive gravity  CONSIDER IT WARILIE REDE AFTINER THAN ANIS WEIL AT ANE ELINK SLIE POETRY NOT TANE IS  GAWIN DOUGLAS  SCOTISH COMIC BALLADS  PEBLIS TO THE PLAY  I  AT beltane quhen ilk bodie bownis  To Peblis

is the maid that like thee ne'er can cloy  Whose wit does enliven each dull pause of joy  And when the short raptures are all at an end  From beautiful mistress turns sensible friend  III  In vain do I praise thee or strive to reveal  Too nice for expression what only we feel  In a that ye do in each look and each mien  The graces in waiting adorn you unseen  When I see you I luve you when hearing adore  I wonder and think you a woman no more  Till mad wi admiring I canna contain  And kissing your lips you turn woman again  IV  With thee in my bosom how can I despair  I'll gaze on thy beauties

the storm in my mind  Tho loudest of thunders on louder waves roar  There's naething like leaving my love on the shore  To leave thee behind me my heart is sair pain'd  But by ease that's inglorious no fame can be gain'd  And beauty and love's the reward of the brave  And I maun deserve it before I can crave  III  Then glory my Jeany maun plead my excuse  Since honour commands me how can I refuse  Without it I ne'er can have merit for thee  And losing thy favour I'd better not be  I gae then my lass to win honour and fame  And if I should chance to come glorious hame  I'll bring a heart to thee with love running o'er  And then I'll leave thee and Lochaber no more  XXXIX  I  FOR the sake of gold she has left me  And of all that's dear has bereft me  She me forsook for a great duke  And to endless woe she has left me  A star and garter have more art  Than youth a true and faithful heart  For empty titles we must part  For glittering show she has left me  II  No cruel fair shall ever move  My injured heart again to love  Thro distant climates I must rove  Since Jeany she has left me  Ye Powers above I to your care  Resign my faithless lovely fair  Your choicest blessings be her

ancient Scotish poetry the reader has already been informed that the editor was indebted to Dr Percy who to the copy in his handwriting from which this is printed annexed the following account of the original MS  This old song is preserved in the Pepysian Library at Magdalen College in Cambridge in p of an ancient MS collection of old Scotish songs and poems in folio which MS had I believe been a present to the founder of that library old Mr Pepys from the duke of Lauderdale minister to king Charles II It had originally belonged to that duke's  ancestor Sir Richard Maitland knt who lived in the reign of queen Mary and her son king James VI and contains a great number of songs and poems by the said Sir Richard Maitland which are of high poetical merit and throw moreover great light on the incidents and manners of that age It is remarkable that this old bard Sir Richard Maitland was blind like Homer and Milton at least at the time when some of his poems were written as he expressly mentions it and consoles himself very poetically under the loss of his sight and very advanced age in one of his pieces intitled  The blind Baron's Comfort  Besides his own pieces the MS contains a selection of the pieces of other bards collected by him some of them as this of James I no where else pre∣served  The foregoing poem is expressly quoted for king James I's composition and postiively ascribed to that monarch in John Major's Scotish History to See his account of king James I towards the end where Major seems to hint that a parody had been made of this song of the king's to ridi∣cule him for some low intrigue in which the king had been detected c I have not the book by me but with this clue the meaning of that very obscure passage I think may be decyphered  This song written by king James I is a proof that  Christ's Kirk on the Green  was written by his de∣scendant James V being evidently a more modern composition  The passage of Major mentioned above is as fol∣lows  Artificlosum libellum de Regina dum captivus erat composuit antequam eam in conjugem duceret et aliam artificiosam cantilenam ejusdem  Yas sen  c et jucundum artificiosumque illum cantum  At Bel∣tayn  c quam alij de Dalkeith et Gargeil mutare studuerunt quia in arce aut camera clausus serva∣batur in qua mulier cum matre habitabat  Dr P after writing his own remarks having communicated this poem to several of his learned friends they interspersed theirs and I shall here give their observations and a few of my own upon this singular production after a few preliminary notices that may be necessary to the English reader  James I king of Scotland and the undoubted au∣thor of the production now under view was born in the year being the son of Robert III His fa∣ther to screen him from the ambitious designs of his uncle the duke of Albany sent him to France but he was unfortunately taken at sea and ungenerously detained in captivity by the kings of England though during a truce between the two realms for nineteen  years nor was he released without payment of an immense ransom Upon his assuming the government on the death of his father in he enacted many wise laws and acquired the esteem and af∣fection of his people but attempting to reform the feudal system of his kingdom and in consequence to curb the power of his nobles he was by some of the chief of them murdered in his bed in being the th year of his age and th of his reign  Ballenden in his translation of Hector Boece's His∣tory gives this character of him  He was weil learnit to fecht with the sword to just to turnay to wer∣syl to syng and dance was an expert mediciner richt crafty in playing baith of lute and harp and sindry othir instrumentis of musik He was expert in gramar oratry and poetry and maid so flowand and sententious versis apperit well he was ane natural and borne poete  Mr Walpole in his Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors gives us this list of the works of James I  A panegyric on his queen  Scotch Sonnets one book One of them a lamen∣tation while in England is in MS in the Bodleian Li∣brary and praises Gower and Chaucer exceedingly  Rythmos Latinos lib I  On Music  He is said to have written some poetical pieces when in England which is very likely but it appears to me that  Peblis to the Play  could not be one of these He being not more than twelve years of age when he left Scotland it is not to be supposed that he was so fa∣miliar with the manners of his countrymen as to paint them so minutely as is done in this poem  PEBLIS TO THE PLAY Peblis or Peebles is the countytown of Twedale Ettrick forest is not far dis∣tant from it That forest was a royal chace hence the kings of Scotland frequently resided there Darn∣ley was there in the winter before his death H  Play  appears to me here to mean an  annual festival  some of which are still celebrated in different villages in England The day is still observed though the occasion is lost in remote antiquity ED  Stanza  Beltane  A great Celtic festival on the first or second of May See more of it in Macpherson's Dissertations H  Ib  found  Perhaps from the A S  tendere  to go  aliquo tendens Vide Lye Lexicon AngloSaxon P  The construction of this passage which is miserably confused owing solely as would appear to the lust of alliteration seems to me this  They found the solace  of the singing and music  sooth to say by firth and by forest furth  or around ED  St  Garray  Perhaps the same as  deray  vulgar words for jollity P  Garish  is used in England for shewy vain pomp H  Garray  perhaps is  prattle  from AngloSaxon    Garrire  P  Ib  Glew  In English  Glee  Mirth AngloSaxon  and  P  Ib  Blew  That is  blue  quite gloomy out of hu∣mour P  To  look blue  is still a phrase implying to  seem melan∣choly  ED  St  Gend Gent  is an epithet often applied to la∣dies by Spenser It probably means  delicate  or perhaps  slender  or it may be an abbreviation of  gentle  JB  The annotator has not observed that none of his in∣terpretations has any connexion with the context The girl was so  guckit  foolish and so  gend  that she would not eat  Gend  must imply  peevish  ED  St  Amang yon marchands my dudds do  Dr P reads  Amang yon marchands my dudds do  and interprets the latter clause  My clothes or dudds being done  I think the line only required the point of interroga∣tion which I have lent it to be perfectly intelligible What says the country girl  My ragged cloths do amang  you fine folk  An expression quite natural and in cha∣racter The whole stanza strongly paints the affecta∣tion of a rustic beauty and coquette  Alas  says she  am I not clearly ruined I dare not go to the show I am so sunburnt  though at the same time she was too sensible of the lustre of her complexion  Will my ragged clothes do among you folks drest as fine as foreign merchants  though at this time she was drest out in all her sinery  Marry I shall only try to stand afar off and look at them as if I was at home in my homely habit  though at the same time she meaned not to go as a gazer but as knowing her∣self an object that would draw universal admiration ED  St Hop  Hop Calyé and Cardronow    Cailyé  is the name of a place in the neighbourhood of Peebles so also is  Cardrona  H  Hop  or  Hope  is the same If I remember right I have seen in print a metrical charter of a Scotish king either of  Hop  by itself or with other lands  for service of a braid arrow whenever he came to hunt in Yarrow  ED  Ib  Rohumbelow  is the burden of an old Scotish tune  It was the burden or chorus of a triumphal song made by the Scots on occasion of the victory gained at Bannockburn P  One stanza of this song is preserved by Abercromby and is if my memory serves me  What weened the king of England  So soon to win all Scotland  With a bey and a how rohumbelow  ED  St  birkin hat  A hat made of birch interwoven like straw hats worn by rusticks P  Ib  There fore ane man to the holt  This seems to be a piece of an old song P  St  How at thai wald dispone thame How at  that is  How that  a common Northern defect So in the Northumberland Houshold Book  passim As ye

Northamptonshire for rude rustic jollity  Oly prancing doings  are strange disorderly inordinate sport∣ings formerly used in Pilgrimages P  Ib  Adone with ane mischance  Have done with a plague or mischief to you P  Ib  He hydis tyt  Probably  He spreads the table quickly expeditiously  P  I do not approve of this explanation of the very in∣genious annotator as the speaker in the next line  save one desires the landlady to see that the  napré  or table cloth be white which implies he had not got it to spread I have no doubt but we should read  he bydis tyt  without a parenthesis  He bids dress out the table quickly  ED  St  At ye aucht  That is  that ye owe  P  St  broggit stauf  is a stump of a small tree stript of the bark and stuck into the ground with the ends of the branches left projecting out a little way in order to hang cups c on for ready use P  It is I think a staff with a spike in it of the nature of a goad but shorter H  St Two lines of this stanza appear to be lost which seems to throw a little embarrassment over this part of the narration ED  St  I wait weil qubat it was  The word  nocht  has been omitted by the transcriber H  I am rather led to think the usual phrase of this bal∣lad  quod he  is here omitted  I wait weil quhat it was quod he  The sense of this confused stanza appears to be  'you have bedaubed me fy for shame'  says the wife  sie how you have drest me How fell you Sir  Sir is often used in Scotland for Sirrah If you say Sir to a peasant he will sometimes retort Sir rogue or Sir gentleman He answers  As my girden brak  She interrupts him with  What meikle devil may lest ye  for I think it ought to be  ye  not  me Lest  seems to be equivalent with  leze  to hurt as  leze majesty  high treason  What the devil hurt you  He answers  I know well it was my own gray mare that threw me As Or  seems an error of the old transcriber indeed in old writ the words will be quite similar  if I was faint and lay doun to rest me  If this is not the sense I leave the passage to future com∣mentators for when  Christs Kirk on the Green  boasts of such learned and respectable interpreters as Bishop Gib∣son and Mr Calendar it is not to be supposed that a poem of such superior antiquity and curiosity as this is will want illustration ED  St  nokks  The nich in the ends of the bows in which the bowstring is inserted P  St  Schamon's dance  That is the Showman's dance P  I take this to be an Irish word H  Schamon  I interpret with Dr P  Showman  but think  Showman  here means  player  or  actor such a dance as was danced on the stage  In a fragment of a ballad published in a collection Edinburgh vols vo in the description of a fairy is this line  His legs were scant a  shathmonts  length  The words seem the same perhaps  shathmont  or  schamon  is after all the old Scotish word for a cricket  or some other nimble insect  Schamons dance  will in that case denote a quick reel ED  St  Than all the wenschis Te he thai

unfledged callow bird P  He cried like a child that has lost its father ANON  Ib  sayis the sang  This proves that love songs were current and committed to memory in Scotland before the year about which time this poem must have been written and if we may judge from this line of  no mean merit it being as smooth as could be expected at this day ED  St  Settand schaftis  I suspect the word  schaftis  has been brought from the end of the third line to this The sun  settand schaftis  if it means  throwing darts  and no other interpretation can be thought of may indeed be that kind of bastard sense that is not uncommon in old versifiers of the middling class but I believe James I would not have written it  The sun was sett and  Or  The sun was setting  a word wanting would appear the proper way of reading this line ED  Settand  is the old termination of the participle of the present tense now altered to  setting  P  Ib  Had thair bein mair  c This dry joke of the king's calls to remembrance a similar stroke in the  Morgante Maggiore  of Pulci where a hermit in the middle of an interesting story breaks off by telling the knight his guest and auditor that his candle is done that he has no more and must of consequence go to bed ED  II CHRISTS KIRK ON THE GREEN  THIS edition is given from the last intitled  Two ancient Scottish poems The Gaberlunzie Man and Christs Kirk on the Green with Notes and Observations by John Calendar Esq of Craigforth Edinburgh  vo Bishop Gibson's edition of this ballad printed at Oxford from Bannatyne's MS is the earliest edition I am sorry however to see Mr Calendar quoting Ramsay's edition for some parts of his text as there certainly never was a more ignorant or rash transcriber of an∣cient Scotish poetry than Allan Ramsay He seems to have considered it as very much his property and to have exercised his own profession upon it by shaving curling and powdering it at his will and pleasure Mr Calendar might have given us a transcript of this piece from Bannatyne's MS in the Advocate's library at Edinburgh in which Dr Percy has observed in a MS note  Christs Kirk on the Green  is very different from what it was when filled with the innovations of Allan Ramsay This most ingenious and faithful of all editors of ancient English poetry has likewise the fol∣lowing notice prefixed to his MS copy of  Peblis to the  Play  In Maitland's MS the old song of  Christs Kirk  differs from all the copies I have seen in the con∣clusion of all the stanzas each of which ends with this line by way of burden or chorus  At Christis Kirk on the greene  always preceded by some short line as in this first stanza  Was never in Scotland hard nor sene  Sic dansing nor deray  Nother in Falkland on the grene  Nor Peblis to the Play  As was of Wowairis as I wene  At Chrystis kirk on ane day  Thair come our Kittie wesching clene  In hir new kirtil of gray  full gay  At Chrystis kirk on the grene  which I cannot help thinking is more genuine than that in the Evergreen and the other editions as it so exactly resembles the conclusions of the stanzas in  Peblis to the Play  In consequence of these well founded remarks I have preserved the burthen in this edition throughout  As the foregoing piece was undoubtedly written by James I of Scotland so we have good authority thongh not so infallible to ascribe this to James V a  prince who delighted in low manners and adventures so much as often to disguise himself in order to enjoy them He reigned from to A most cu∣rious account of his death may be found in  Knox's His∣tory of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland  He was the  Zerbino  of Ariosto and is celebrated by Ronsard in as good verses as ever came from his pen  The notes of Mr Calendar are fraught with that knowledge of Northern literature for which he is so justly celebrated and though my opinion can add nothing to the general suffrage I cannot help saying that for universal science of Northern Antiquities and languages Mr Calendar may justly be regarded as the most learned man in Europe I am sorry to see he takes no notice of a work he published a specimen of some time ago in his present publication which leads me to fear he has dropt that grand design This was his  Bibliotheca Septentrionalis  in the manner of D'Her∣belot's Bibliotheque Orientale containing a complete system of Northern science of every kind to be com∣prized in two folio volumes An amazing work and which ought to be made a national concern In his present volume he promises a Glossary of the ancient Scotish language but would he return to the large design above praised the fame would be infinitely greater without much greater labour Words are for  pedants but facts are for all There is perhaps no branch of learning more painful and less glorious than etymology To Mr Calendar the glossary to this vo∣lume is much obliged They who would see what vast intelligence may be bestowed in elucidating  Christs Kirk on the green  and the following piece called  The Gaber∣lunyie man  are referred to his work  I must remind the reader of a curious circumstance which is that Sappho the celebrated poetess wrote a ballad if I may so call it on a  Country Wedding  which is mentioned by Demetrius Phalereus and which I doubt not resembled this He observes she made the Rustic Bridegroom and the Porter speak in mean and vulgar language though she was herself happy in the most exquisite expression where it was to be used with propriety See  Dem Phal  § seq  Christs Kirk on the green  The kirktown of Leslie near Falkland in Fife  St  Falkland on the green  Dr Percy observes there possibly once existed a Scotish song of this title Could this be recovered he adds the subject would be com∣plete  St  As ony rose  c The alliteration in the first of these two lines is happy in the second unfortunate and harsh  lire  signifying flesh nor  skin  St  morreis dance  is so called from the Moors its inventors as they were of the fiddle or violin Pulci mentions it as used in the days of Charles the Great but I suppose on no authority  Avea Cerbante fatti torneamenti  E giostre e feste e balli alla moresea  Morgante Mag  Canto IV st  Curious notices with regard to it may be seen in the last edition of Shakspere  St  Fy he had slain a priest  That is committed the most atrocious of murders To kill a priest was thought to unite sacriledge and murder Cardinal Beaton was sensible of this when he cried upon receiv∣ing his mortal wound  I am a priest I am a priest fy fy all is gone  See Knox  III THE GABERLUNYIE MAN  is likewise ascribed to James V but I am afraid upon no authority If it is his the stanza flows amazingly smooth indeed From stanza II it would appear the writer wished to have it ascribed to James I the first lines of that stanza bearing an analogy to his imprison∣ment in England The nature and naiveté of this piece are exquisite  St I  for your courtesie  That is  by your courtesie  an adjuration  Ib  ayont the ingle  That is  beyond the fire  the warmest place in the room In farm houses of Scot∣land to this day the fireplace often stands in the midst of the kitchen so that the family can all sit around  Ingle  is a word appropriated to familiar fire in Scot∣land to call such  fire  is thought ominous among the country people  IV THE JOLLIE BEGGAR  is likewise ascribed to James V I believe upon no au∣thority but a blunder of Mr Walpole's who con∣founds this with the former The adventure may be the king's but I suspect the description is another's This piece is no less spirited than the former The transitions to opposite passions in both are described in such a rapid and easy manner as would have done credit to the first comic writer  V THE VISION  In a letter which the Editor received some time ago from the author of the Minstrel the following remarks are made upon this poem which being of so good a judge will he doubts not have great weight with the reader  The best Scotish poem of modern times that I have seen for though the title pretends that it was written four hundred years ago I have reason to think that it was produced in this century is called  The Vision  I am inclined to think that the Author of it whoever he was must have read Arbuthnot's His∣tory of John Bull But there are noble images in it and a harmony of versification superior to every thing I have seen in the kind I suspect that is the work of some friend of the family of Stuart and that it must have been composed about the year  St  Saya Fere  Fere for  mate  is a common word in ancient Scotish The Scotish writers even carried it into England with them as we may observe in  the Tra∣gedies of William Alexander of Menstrie London    St It is with regret I observe that the latter part of this stanza is still applicable Many Scotish  peers have not sufficient spirit to slight English gold but ignobly to this hour barter the liberties of their country and their own independence for it May ex∣ecration pursue their memories Scotland is perhaps at this day the only country in Europe to which the philosophical light of liberty has not penetrated To oppose a foolish or corrupt minister is with my coun∣trymen to oppose legal power One of their most cele∣brated writers is just now engaged at a rated salary to defend the cause of corruptionNot all his talents will save him from the contempt of more enlightened pos∣terity  St This ludicrous description of the drunken gods is perfectly risible Nothing in  Midas  or  The Golden Pippin  can exceed it The several attributes are finely preserved  St  Bruce  is here used for him the Jacobites esteem legal heir of the crown The principles of this poem are utterly detested by the Editor as they are by every friend of mankind he only gives it as a piece of fine writing in its way The unhappy attachment to the family of Stuart has wasted the finest estates and shed some of the best blood in Scotland It now exists only in the breasts of old women  The real Bruce Robert I was a hero if ever any such existed The finest epic poem in the world might  be founded on his story  The famous History of the va∣liant Bruce in heroic verse by Patrick Gordon gentleman  Dort  reprinted at Edinburgh  is the best attempt in this way Some of the stanzas are worthy of Spenser  VI ANE HIS AWN ENEMY  This and the eleven following are given from Lord Hales's very accurate publication of Ancient Scotish poems from Bannatyne's MS dated  Edin    IX ROBENE AND MAKYNE  was written by Robert Henryson Schoolmaster at Dunfermline about It ought to have been ob∣served before that VI VII VIII are written by the celebrated William Dunbar the author of the  Goldin Terge  and chief of the ancient Scotish poets  St  an A B C  That is a short instruction a catechism not a whimsical alphabet of vertues as I believe we meet with in Don Quixotte A Amorous B Benevolent c  St  Thay  That is  people folks would blame us  St  Tak tent    Take beed  This Scotish phrase as I am told being used to an English lady his patient by a Scotish physician occasioned a mistake almost fatal The Physician always repeated to her  Above a things Ma'am take tent  She understood he meant she should take tentwine after every meal and suffered much by following the supposed prescription  X THE WOWING OF JOK AND JENNY  This piece as Lord Hales observes exhibits a lu∣dicrous picture of the  curta supellex  of the Scotish com∣mons in the th century Every country must be poor till agriculture or commerce enrich it That the first of these was little cultivated in Scotland till within these late years is well known The following epistle of James VI to Queen Elizabeth of England is a curious proof of the poverty of the grain in Scotland in former times It is copied from a MS in the Editor's posses∣sion  Richt excellent Richt heich and michtie prin∣cesse our dearest suster and cousing in our hartiest maner we recommend us unto you The

the xx day of December Your maist loving and af∣fectioned brother and cousing James R  Indeed at this day  pease bannocks  or cakes made of pease are the principal bread of the Scotish peasantry  Among the above letters of James VI in MS is one to the Dutch about their detention of the Earl of Errol and  another relating to a ship belonging to Adrian Wauch∣ton  the king's painter  St  Ane futebraidsawin  That is a piece of cul∣tivated ground of a foot square A joke like that of the ancient writer who compared a small estate to a Spartan epistle  XI ANE LITTIL INTERLUD c  Lord Hales observes on this singular piece that  some traces of theatrical composition may be dis∣covered in Scotland during the th century Sir David Lindsay wrote several interludes  By the way Sir David Lindsay was once a most po∣pular author in Scotland witness the proverb  Its no in Davie Lindsay  meaning any thing out of the common road He was in great celebrity in his own life time about the period of the reformation A story is told of an honest farmer who being on his deathbed a pious neighbour brought an English bible to read to him The dying man had to that day never known of such a book and upon hearing some of its mi∣raculous contents cried out  Hoot awa Bring me Davie Lindsay That's all a made story  St  Fyn Mackowl  'Better known in England says Lord Hales  under the modernised name of FingalConcerning this personage whether real or imaginary there are innumerable legends in the highlands of Scotland He is more celebrated as a giant then as the hero of Ossian  On the next line 'That dang the devill c' his lordship observes  This may allude to the contest with the spirit of Loda Here let me observe that to doubt Fingal and Temora being ancient compositions is indeed a refinement in scepticism They contain various allusions to the manners of other times which have escaped the observation of Mr Macpher∣son himself  The Editor has been called a zealous defender of the antiquity of Ossian by those who had not understanding enough to perceive the scope of his dissertation on the Oral Tradition of Poetry which only attempts to prove that poetry may be a long time preserved by tradition without the slightest reference to Ossian's antiquity but from probability only of preservation which the candid reader will confess to be no argu∣ment These people will stare when he assures them that so far from being an advocate of Ossian's an∣tiquity he does not regard twenty pages in the whole work as ancient and has always expressed that notion  Nay be must add that if not two lines in the poems of Ossian are ancient that circumstance would if in∣fallibly proved give an infinite addition in his opinion to their superlative merit So little has he of the spirit of an antiquary  St Three stanzas are here omitted as full of filth without humour to palliate it  XII ANE BALLAT OF EVILL WYFFIS  is a singular mixture of religion and satire as is XIII of religion and good fellowship Such absurd mingling of heterogeneous ideas is common in the poets of that period Witness the  Morgante Maggiore  of Pulci where every canto is begun with an address to some person of the Trinity or to the Virgin Mary and a transition immediately made to the wild adventures of the Paladins  XVII RONDEL OF LUVE  St  Ane puir tresour without messour  That is a poor treasure of no measure or account not a pure treasure without measure or bounds  St  To rege with gude adwyiss  seems a translation of  Insanire docet certa ratione modoque  XVIII THE WIFE OF AUCHTERMUCHTY  This ballad has always been very popular in Scot∣land and deserves it as it is fraught with genuine nature and humour In Bannatyne's MS it is inserted in a modern hand  XIX  This is given from  A specimen of a book intituled Ane compendious book of godly and spiritual sangs c Edin    XX LUSTIE MAYE  is given from a Collection  Edin  in which is this note The first verse of this song is cited in a book  intitled The Complaint of Scotland c printed at Saint Andrews whereby it appears to have been a current old Scots song in the reign of James V  See the prefatory Dissertation  This copy is evidently modernized  XXIV  is one of Ramsay's songs and one of his best but the woeful mixture of heathen mythology quite disfigures it  Pallas Jove  c never come from mortal mouth in common life except within the walls of Bedlam but they are a great resource to a writer who wants ideas It may be called the  Phoebus  of poetry The French I think use  le phebus  less properly for  hombast  XXVI  This and XXIX XXXI XXXIV XXXVI XL XLIII XLV XLVIII have not appeared in print  XXX DEIL TAK THE WARS c  This favourite air is in D'Urfey's Pills to purge Me∣lancholy  London  six vols mo It is com∣monly thought much more modern  XXXIII  In the third stanza of this pretty song the reader will observe imitations of Tibullus and Parnell  XXXIV BOTHWELL BANK  So fell it out of late years that an English gentle∣man travelling in Palestine not far from Jerusalem as he passed through a country town he heard by chance a woman sitting at her door dandling her child to sing  Bothwel bank thou blumest fair  The gentleman hereat exceedingly wondered and forth∣with  in English saluted the woman who joyfully answered him and said she was right glad there to see a gentleman of our isle and told him that she was a Scotish woman and came first from Scotland to Venice and from Venice thither where her for∣tune was to be the wife of an officer under the Turk who being at that instant absent and very soon to return she intreated the gentleman to stay there untill his return The which he did and she for countrysake to shew herself the more kind and boun∣tiful unto him told her husband at his homecoming that the gentleman was her kinsman whereupon her husband entertained him very kindly and at his departure gave him divers things of good value  Versiegan  in his  Restitution of decayed Intelligence Ant∣werp  Chap  Of the sirnames of our ancient fa∣milies  XXXV  This was written by the celebrated Marquis of Mon∣trose and shows that he thought there was a necessity for displaying his superstitious loyalty even in a song A drawling second part and one stanza of this are omitted  This nobleman who was certainly a great warrior and is esteemed a hero by the defenders of Charles I  was diverse yeires very zealous for the covenant and at the first time that the English came down to the kirks when the Scots army lay at Dunslaw the lot of his regiment was first to cross Tweed whilk he did himself in the midst of the winter boots and all Yet thereafter at the subscryving of the league and covenant finding that General Lesly was preferred to him he changed his mind and betook himself to the king's party  Scot of Scotstarvet's Staggering State of the Scottish Statesmen  MS Heroes are mighty cheap baubles in the eyes of people of reflection and knowledge of mankind  There is a curious account of his condemnation c in a MS in the Editor's possession intitled  A Letter of the proceedings of the parliament  of Scotland  Anno    written from Edr May    an    by Mr Thomas Winzat to his brother George Winzat  to  XXXIX  This sweet air was written by the late Dr Austin of Edinburgh upon a lady's marriage with one of the dukes of Scotland after she had given him much en∣couragement in his addresses to her  XL  Blackford hill is one of the romantic environs of Edinburgh that most romantic of all cities in situation  XLVII  This excellent song is already popular in England The author of the words and of the air are I be∣lieve both unknown though they are both of super∣lative beauty  XLIX  This fine little air is in the style of what the French call a  rondelet  and in none of their  rondelets  is the re∣turn of the words better managed  GLOSSARY TO THE SECOND VOLUME  {inverted ⁂}  Any words not in this will be found in the Glossary
