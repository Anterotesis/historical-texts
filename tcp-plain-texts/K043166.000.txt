JACKSON  Miss NEVILLE  Mrs HARTLEY  Madam LA ROUGE  Miss AMBROSE  Know your own Mind  ACT the FIRST  Scene the House of  Sir JOHN MILLAMOUR  Enter  Sir JOHN  and  BYGROVE  BYGROVE  WHY then I'd marry again and disinherit him  Sir  JOHN  Brother Bygrove you think too severely in these matters  BYGROVE  Severely Sir John If I had a mind that my son should marry why should he not do as I would have him  Sir  JOHN  Allowance must be made for inclination The success of our children depends upon the manner in which we set them out in the world They are like bowls which if deliver'd out of hand with a due regard to their bias our aim is answer'd if otherwise they are short or wide of the mark in view or perhaps rush wildly out of the green  BYGROVE  Well argued truly he that should obey is to judge for himself and you that are his governor are to be directed by him  Sir  JOHN  Why he is chiefly interested in the end and the choice of the means may be fairly left to himself I can't but be tender of George a plant of my own rearing and the tree will hereafter be known by its fruit  BYG  It is a tree that will bear nothing without grafting and if I could not inoculate what will make it thrive and flourish it should not incumber a foot of my land  Sir  JOHN  Your system and mine differ widely Brother Bygrove My son is of a large and liberal understanding and I a father of mild authority  BYG  Authorityyour son's word is a law to you Now there is my young graceless he is in the army and why Because I chose it I had a mind he should serve and so he went to be shot at No arguing with me If I see any thing wrong I accost him directly Look ye Sir do you think to go on in this fashion Not during my life I promise you I will acknowledge you no longer than you prove worthy and if you can't discern what is befitting you I at least will judge what is proper on my part  Sir  JOHN  Well George and I have lived together as friends From a boy I endeavoured to subject him rather to his reason than his fears If any little irregularity happened he was no sooner sensible of it than his cheek coloured and the blush of youth not only looked decent but expressed an ingenuous and welldisposed mind  BYG  But the consequence of all this Has he a settled opinion a fixed principle for a moment He is grown up in caprice his judgment has not vigour to be decisive upon the merest trifle he is destracted by little things and of course is perishing by little and little  Sir  JOHN  Oh no all from a good cause his knowledge of life occasions quick reflection quick reflection shews things in a variety of lights I am not angry He will settle in the world you will see him married before long  BYG  In what a variety of lights his wife will appear to him  Sir  JOHN  I beg your pardon for a moment I see person there Charles Charles this way  Enter  CHARLES  Sir  JOHN  Well Charles what is he about  CHARLES  Very busy Sir a thousand things in hand  BYG  And all at the same time I'll warrant  CHARLES  We have a deal to employ us Sir  Sir  JOHN  Have you sounded him in regard to what I mentioned last night  CHARLES  That's what I wanted to tell your Honour Last night Sir as he was going to bed I touch'd upon the subject dropt a hint or two that it is now time to think of raising heirs to himself enlarged upon the comforts of matrimony and I think with no small degree of eloquence  BYG  The fellow is laughing at you  Sir  JOHN  Well and how What effect  CHARLES  A very visible effect Sir This morning early my master rings his bell Charles says he I have been considering what you said last night I shall pay a visit to the young ladies and I believe I shall marry one of them  Sir  JOHN  There Mr Bygrove I am for ever obliged to you Charles Well go on  CHARLES  I fly immediately to get him his things to dress and return in an instant Charles says he then tossed himself back in his chair beat the ground with his heel and fell a reading Won't your Honour get ready to visit the young ladiesThe ladies what ladies you blockheadLady Bell and Lady Jane your Honour Mrs Bromley's handsome nieces Po you're a numskull says he with an oblique kind of a smile stretched his arms yawned talked to himself and bade me go about my business  BYG  I knew it would end so There is not a craneneck carriage in town can give a short turn with  him He will continue going on from one thing to another and end in nothing at last  Sir  JOHN  This is provoking Any body with him this morning  CHARLES  He has had a power of people with him SirA commissionbroker to sell him a company in a marching regiment the Mayor of a borough about a seat in parliament And there are several with him now Sir There is Sir Harry Lovewit and  BYG  Aye Sir Harry I am glad he is of age and that I am no longer his guardian He has not had a new idea in his head since he was five years old and yet the blockhead affects to be lively He runs after wits who do nothing but laugh at him He repeats scraps and sentences all memory and no understanding a mere retailer of what falls from other people and with that stock he sets up for a wit  CHARLES  He is with my master Sir and there is Mr Malvil and Mr Dashwould and  bell rings  He rings Sir you will pardon me I must be gone Sir  Exit  BYG  And that fellow Dashwould he is the ruin of your son and of poor Sir Harry into the bargain He is the Merry Andrew of the town honour has no restraint upon him truth he sets at nought and friendship he is ever ready to sacrifice to a joke  Sir  JOHN  Po mere innocent pleasantry Dashwould has no harm in him  BYG  No harm in him I grant you the fellow has a quick sense of the ridiculous and draws a character with a lucky hit But every thing is distorted by him He has wit to ridicule you invention to frame a story of you humour to help it about and when he has set the town a laughing he puts on a familiar air and shakes you by the hand  Enter  Sir HARRY  laughing violently  Sir  HARRY  Oh ho ho I shall certainly expire one day in a fit of laughing  Sir  JOHN  What's the matter Sir Harry  BYG  What fool's errand brings him hither  Sir  HARRY  That fellow Dashwould will be the death of me The very spirit of whim wit humour and raillery possess him  BYG  Ay wit and humour for the meridian of your understanding  Sir  HARRY  By the shade of Rablais he is the most entertaining creature He has play'd off such a firework of wit I'll tell you what he said this moment  BYG  No Sir no if you are a pedlar in smart sayings and brisk repartees we don't desire you to unpack for us  Sir  HARRY  A plague on him for an agreeable devil And then the rogue has so much ease  BYG  Yes the ease of an executioner He puts all to death without remorse He laughs at every thing as if Heaven intended to make its own work ridiculous He has no relish for beauty natural or moral He is in love with deformity and never better pleased than when he has most reason to find fault  Sir  HARRY  There is a picture of as harsh features as any in Dashwould's whole collection  BYG  But the picture is true No exaggerationin it  Sir  HARRY  He gave us a miniature of you this morning my dear guardian and you shall have it Dashwould has made a discovery Sir John What reason do you think he gives for Mr Bygrove's railing for ever at your son's inconstancy of temper  BYG  Ay now now  Sir  HARRY  You positively shall hear it Mr Bygrove's desires being all rusted to a point looking directly toward the land of matrimony  BYG  Matrimony now gild the pill with humour and down it goes  Sir  HARRY  Dashwould has found you out Mr Bygrove's desires being all collected and fixed on matrimony he rails at the variety of my friend Milamour's whimsies like Sir George Bumper with chalkstones on his knuckles as big as nutmegs hobbling along and thanking  Doctor Le Fevre  that he has no small humours flying about him  Sir  JOHN  That's a discovery indeed  BYG  Sir John can you mind what such a fellow as Dashwould says Every thing that passes through the medium of his fancy appears deformed as the straitest stick looks crooked in troubled water  Sir  HARRY  Well dashed out upon my soul with tolerable spleen and some vivacity  BYG  Poif you had taken my advice Sir Harry and renounced his acquaintance long ago you had been now a young man coming into life with some promise of a character Continue in dissipation Sir For my part it is a rule with me neither to give nor take a joke  Sir  HARRY  Ho ho ho a pleasant rule positively ho ho ho Dashwould shall have it this moment do you take the consequence and in the mean time I'll leave you to the practice of your social humour  Exit  BYG  It is such coxcombs as that butterfly that encourage him to fix his pasquinades upon every man's character Matrimonya licentious No Sir John I still cherish the memory of your sister she was the best of wives 'sdeath interrupted again by thatNo it's my friend Malvil he is a man of true value  Sir  JOHN  Dashwould says he is a compound of false charity and real malice  BYG  And it is enough for you that Dashwould says it Malvil is a man of honour Sir and an enemy to all scandal though wit prove a palateable ingredient in the poison  Enter  MALVIL  MAL  Intolerable there is no being safe where he is A licentious railer All truth all morality sacrificed to a jest nothing sacred from his buffoonery  BYG  I told you Sir John how it is  MAL  Oh such indiscriminate satire  BYG  Yes the fellow runs a muck and nothing escapes him  MAL  There is no enduring it Ridicule is a very unfair weapon Mr Bygrove it is by no means the test of truth Sir John  Sir  JOHN  Nay but you are too grave about this matter  MAL  Too grave Shall he wantonly stab the reputation of his neighbour and then tell you it was in jest For my part I had rather throw a veil over the infirmities of my friend than seek a malicious pleasure in the detection That's my way of thinking  Sir  JOHN  I fancy you are right This son of mine does so perplex me  walks aside  MAL  Pray Mr Bygrove give me leave I am sorry to hear certain whispers about a friend of ours  BYG  About whom the widow Mrs Bromley  MAL  Oh no no I have a great respect for her though IPray don't you think she throws out the lure for a young husband  BYG  For a husband yes but not too young a one you can serve my interest in that quarter  MAL  I know it rely upon my friendship But have you heard nothing of an eminent Turkey merchant  BYG  Mr Freeport  MAL  I say nothing I don't like the affair have you really heard nothing  BYG  Not a syllable  MAL  So much the better though it is fit you should be put upon your guard Any money of yours in his hands  BYG  Po as safe as the bank  MAL  I may be mistaken I hope I am I was in company the other night several members of parliament present they did not speak plainly hints and inuendos only you won't let it go any further His seat in the house they all agreed is perfectly convenient at this juncture I hope the cloud will blow overI shall remember you with the widow  BYG  One good turn deserves another I shan't be unmindful of your interest  MAL  There now you hurt me you know my delicacy must friendship never act a disinterested part I esteem you Mr Bygrove and that's sufficient Sir John give me leave to say the man who busies himself about other people's affairs is a pragmatical character and very dangerous in society  BYG  So I have been telling Sir John But to laugh at every thing is the fashion of the age A pleasant goodfornothing fellow is by most people preferred to modest merit A man like Dashwould who runs onSo here come Scandal in folio  Enter  DASHWOULD  DASH  Sir John I rejoice to see you Mr Bygrove I kiss your hand Malvil have you been uneasy for any friend since  MAL  Po absurd  walks away  DASH  I have been laughing with your son Sir John Pray have I told you about Sir Richard Doriland  BYG  You may spare him Sir he is a very worthy man  DASH  He is so great goodnature about him I love Sir Richard You know he was divorced from his wife a good fine woman but an invincible ideot  MAL  Look ye there now Mr Bygrove  BYG  My Lady Doriland Sir was always counted a very sensible woman  DASH  She was so with too much spirit to be ever at ease and a rage for pleasure that broke the bubble as she grasped it She fainted away upon hearing that Mrs Allnight had two card tables more than herself  BYG  Inveterate malice  DASH  They waged war a whole winter for the honour of having the greatest number of fools thinking of nothing but the odd trick First Mrs Allnight kept Sundays her Ladyship did the same Mrs Allnight had forty tables her Ladyship rose to fifty Then one added then t'other 'till every room in the house was cramm'd like the black hole at Calcutta and at last upon casting up the account Sir Richard sold off fifteen hundred acres to clear incumbrances  Sir  JOHN  Ridiculous and so they parted upon this  DASH  Don't you know the history of that business  MAL  Now mark him now  DASH  Tender of reputation MalvilThe story is well known She was detected withthe little foreign CountI call him the SalamanderI saw him sive times in one winter upon the back of the fire at Bath for cheating at cards  MAL  Go on Sir abuse every body My Lady was perfectly innocent I know the whole affair a mere contrivance to lay the foundation of a divorce  DASH  So they gave our Sir Richard did not care a ninepin for her while she was his You know his way he despises what is in his possession and languishes for what is not Her Ladyship was no sooner married towhat's his nameHis father was a footman and Madam Fortune who every now and then loves a joke sent him to the East Indies and in a few years brought him back at the head of half a million for the jest's sake  MAL  Mr Dashwould upon my word Sir Families to be run down in this manner  DASH  Mushroon was his name my Lady Doriland was no sooner married to him but up to his eyes Sir Richard was in love with her He dressed at her sighed at her danced at her she is now libelled in the Commons and Sir Richard has a  crim con  against him in the King's Bench  MAL  Pshaw I shall stay no longer to hear this strain of defamation  Exit  DASH  Malvil must you leave us A pleasant character this same Mr Malvil  BYG  He has a proper regard for his friends Sir  DASH  Yes but he is often present where their characters are canvassed and is anxious about whispers which nobody has heard He knows the use of hypocrisy better than a Court Chaplain  BYG  There call honesty by a burlesque name and so pervert every thing  DASH  Things are more perverted Mr Bygrove when such men as Malvil make their vices do their work under a mask of goodness and with that stroke we'll dismiss his character  Sir  JOHN  Ay very right my brother Bygrove has a regard for him and to change the subject My son Mr Dashwould what does he intend  DASH  Up to the eyes in love with Lady Bell and determined to marry her  Sir  JOHN  I told you so Mr Bygrove I told you you would soon see him settled in the world Mr Dashwould I thank you I'll step and consirm George in his resolution  Exit  DASH  A goodnatur'd man Sir John and does not want credulity  BYG  Ay there the moment his back is turned  DASH  Gulliver's Travels is a true history to him His son has strange flights First he was to be a lawyer bought chambers in the Temple eat his commons and was called to the bar Then the law is a damn'd dry municipal study the army is fitter for a gentleman and as he was going to the Waroffice to take out his commission he saw my Lord Chancellor's coach go by in an instant back to the Temple and no sooner there  Po pox hang the law better marry and live like a gentleman  Now marriage is a galling yoke and he does not know what he'll do He calls his man Charles sends him away walks about the room sits down asks a question thinks of something else talks to himself sings whistles lively pensive pleasant and melancholy in an instant He approves sinds fault he will he will not and in short the man does not know his own mind for half a secondHere comes Sir John  Enter Sir  JOHN  DASH  You find him disposed to marry Sir John  Sir  JOHN  I hope so he wavers a little but still I  BYG  Po I have no patience my advice has been all lost upon you I wish it may end well A good morning Sir John  going  DASH  Mr Bygrove your's Sir John will defend you in your absence  BYG  If you will forget your friends in their absence it is the greatest favour you can bestow upon them  Exit  DASH  Did I ever tell you what happened to him last summer at Tunbridge  Sir  JOHN  Excuse me for the present This light young man I must step and talk with my lawyer  DASH  I'll walk part of the way with you A strange medley this same Mr Bygrove with something like wit he is always abusing witYou must know last summer at Tunbridge  Sir  JOHN  Another time if you please

this house  Enter  RICHARD  CHARLES  Well Richard what are you about  RICH  Why a man in a whirlwind may as well tell what he is about Going to order the coachman to put up He intends to change his dress and walk to the Temple  Exit  CHARLES  What does he mean by talking of the Temple again I hope we are not going to take to our studies once more I hate the law there is not a footman in the Temple has a grain of taste All mere lawyers They have not an idea out of the profession  Enter  ROBERT  ROB  Richard Richard where is he gone  CHARLES  What's in the wind now  ROB  The wind's in another quarter He has been writing verses as he calls them ever since the company left him He has torn a quire of paper I believe and now he wants the carriage directly  Exit  CHARLES  Run and order

 There again now this is the way from morning to night  MIL  entering  The sooner the better I promised Sir John and I will pay this visit Lady Bell reigns sovereign of my heart That vivacity of mind "Quick as her eyes and as unfix'd as those"  CHARLES  She is by far preferable to her sister your Honour  MIL  Po you are illiterate in these matters The sober graces of Lady JaneLady Bell advances like a conqueror and demands your heart Lady Jane seems unconscious of her charms and yet enslaves you deeper  CHARLES  Which of them does your Honour think  MIL  Which of'em Charles  reads a paper  "I look'd and I sigh'd and I wish'd I could speak"  Enter  ROBERT  ROB  Captain Bygrove Sir  MIL  That's unlucky I am not at home tell him I went out an hour ago  Enter  Captain BYGROVE  MIL  My dear Bygrove I longed to see you But why that pensive air Still in love I suppose  Exeunt Charles and Robert  Capt  BYG  My dear Millamour you have guessed it I am in love and I glory in my chains  MIL  Shall I tell you a secret I suspect myself plaguily Every thing is not as quiet here as it used to be  Capt  BYG  Indulge the happy passion Let wits and libertines say what they will 'there is no true happiness but in the married state  MIL  Why I have thought much upon the subject of late and with a certain refinement I don't know but a man may fashion a complying girl to his taste of happiness Virtuous himself he confirms her in her virtue constant he secures her fidelity and by continuing the lover instead of commencing the tyrant husband he wins from her the sweetest exertion of tenderness and love I shall most positively marry Who is your idol My dear boy impart  Capt  BYG  There I beg to be excused You know my father I must not presume to think for myself I must contrive some stratagem to make him propose the match Were it to move first from me I should be obliged to decamp from before the town at once  MIL  I wish you success My resolution is taken and with the most amiable of her sex She romps about the room like one of the Graces and deals about her wit with such a happy negligence  Capt  BYG  An agreeable portrait but mine is the very reverse That equal serenity in all her ways Wit she has but without ostentation and elegance itself seems the pure effect of nature  MIL  aside  I don't know whether that is not the true character for a wife And pray what progress have you made in her affections  Capt  BYG  Enough to convince me that I am not quite unacceptable My dear Millamour I had rather fold that girl in my arms than kiss his Majesty's hand for the first regiment of guards  MIL  I am a lost man I shall most positively marry We will wonder at each others felicity and be the envy of all our acquaintance  Enter  DASHWOULD  DASH  I am as good as my word you see Most noble Captain your father was here this morning A good agreeable old gentleman and about as pleasant as a night mare Millamour whom do you think I met since I saw you  MIL  Whom  DASH  Our friend Beverly just imported from Paris perfectly frenchified and abusing every thing in this country  Oh there is no breathing their English atmosphereRoast beef and liberty will be the death of me  MIL  Ha ha poor Beverley I saw him last summer at Paris dressed in the stile of an English foxhunter he swore there was not a morsel to eat in their country kept an operasinger upon beefsteaks and oystersauce drove to his villa every Saturday in a phaeton and returned on the Monday like a young Buck just come upon town  DASH  He has done his country great honour abroad  BYG  He will settle at home now he is going to he married  DASH  Yes I hear he is in love and much good may it do him I wish I may die if I know so ridiculous a thing as love  My lifeMy soulHybla dwells upon her lips extasy and bliss blank verse and pastoral nonsense  In a I'ttle time the man wonders what bewitched him an arm chair after dinner and a box and dice till five in the morning make all the comforts of his life  MIL  Very true Love is a ridiculous passion indeed  Capt  BYG  Do you take up arms against me But a moment since just as you came in he was acknowledging to me  MIL  No not I truly I acknowledge nothing  Marriage is not to my taste I promise you The handsome wifeshe is all affectation routs drums hurricanes and intrigue  DASH  And the ugly she makes it up with good sense pronounces upon wit and talks you dead with maxims characters and reflections  MIL  And the woman of high birth she produces her pedigree as her patent for vice and folly "Seven's the main" and away goes your whole fortune  Capt  BYG  Mere common place  DASH  And the tender maukin she doats upon you  Don't drink any more my dear you'll take cold near that window my love pray don't talk so much you'll flurry your spirits  And then kisses you before company  MIL  And the sick madam she has the vapours and finds that she has nerves"I wish I had none'  But it is too true that I have nerves as slight as so many hairs  DASH  Ha ha the whole sex is divided into so many classes of folly  MIL  Right so it is Ha ha ha  both laugh  Capt  BYG  You play finely into one another's hands  MIL  Now mark the champion of the sex  both laugh  DASH  Yes he'll throw down the gauntlet for 'em  both laugh  Capt  BYG  Nay decide it your own way Since you won't hear gentlemen there is a clear stage for you  Exit  DASH  Fare ye well most noble Captain A facetious companion did you ever hear him say any thing  MIL  He is in for it and my father would fain reduce me to the same condition with one of Mrs Bromley's nieces A good fine woman Mrs Bromley  DASH  Has been Were she now to rub her cheek  with a white handkerchief her roses and lilies would go to the clear starcher  MIL  Ha ha and yet she sets up for the rival of her nieces  DASH  The young ladies are pretty well in their way too Lady Bell has a brisk volubility of nothing that she plays the pretty ideot with and Lady Jane a sly piece of formality ready to go post for Scotland with the first redcoat that asks her the question We all dine at the Widow's to day are you to be with us  MIL  Yes to meet you the party will be diverting  DASH  Observe old Bygrove He pronounces with rigour upon the conduct of others and hopes his own follies lie concealed His whole struggle is to escape detection He hoodwinks himself and thinks he blinds you Positive and dogmatical in his opinions yet a dupe to the designs of others and flattering himself that a peevish and censorious spirit hides every defect he gives you the full ridicule of his character  MIL  I have marked him before now  DASH  Mark him with the widow you will see him sighing for his deceased wife and Mrs Bromley's charms at the same time One eye shall weep for the dead and the other ogle the living  MIL  Ha haAnd then Malvil laying siege to Miss Neville  DASH  Miss Neville is the best of them Mrs Bromley has taken her into her house as a poor relation whom she pities and her pity is no more than the cruel art of tormenting an unhappy dependant upon her generosity  MIL  But she has generosity She has promised Miss Neville a fortune of five thousand pounds  DASH  And so the hook is baited for Malvil The widow flings out that snare to counteract Sir Harry  MIL  Sir Harry  DASH  Yes he is in love with Miss Neville and the best of the story is he is afraid I shall think him ridiculous If I say the word and promise not to laugh at him he breaks his mind at once Miss Neville sees clearly that he admires her and of course will never listen to Malvil The selfinterested designs of that fellow shall be disappointed  MIL  Admirable thou art a whimsical fellow Come I attend you A pleasant group they are all together It is as you say  Ours passions sicken and our pleasures cloy  A fool to laugh at is the height of joy  Exeunt  ACT the SECOND  Scene at  Mrs BROMLEY'S  Enter  Mrs BROMLEY  and  Miss NEVILLE  Mrs BROMLEY  WHY to be sure Neville there is something in what you say one is so odd and so I don't know how in a morning  Miss  NEV  Certainly madam and then people of your turn whose wit overflows in conversation are liable to a waste of spirits and the alteration appears sooner in them  Mrs  BROM  So it does you observe very prettily upon things Heigho I am as faded as an old lutestring today  Miss  NEV  No indeed madam you look very tolerably consideting  Mrs  BROM  aside  Considering she grows pert I thinkI am glad you think me not altogether intolerable  Miss  NEV  Ma'am  Mrs  BROM  Tolerably she is Lady Bell's prime agent  aside  Has Sir Harry given you hopes lately  Miss  NEV  Sir Harry I really don't understand why he is mentioned  Mrs  BROM  Do you think it will be a match And have you made up your quarrel with Lady Bell  sits down  Miss  NEV  The sweetness of her disposition reconciles every thing  Mrs  BROM  And is Millamour reconciled to Lady Bell  Miss  NEV  There was only a slight mistake which I explained  Mrs  BROM  Oh you explained that was prudently done I am glad to hear this and do you think he loves her Tell me tell me all Why why do you think he loves her  Miss  NEV  He cannot be insensible of her merit and the other day he asked me if you were likely to approve of his proposing for Lady Bell  Mrs  BROM  And you told himWell what did you tell him  Miss  NEV  That you no doubt would be ready to promote the happiness of so amiable a young lady  Mrs  BROM  You told him so  rises and walks about  And so you are turned matchmaker you busy yourself in my familyHeyMrs Startup you are dizened out I think my wardrobe has supplied you  Miss  NEV  Your pardon ma'am I had these things in the country when you first shewed so much goodness to me  Mrs  BROM  What airs you know I hate to see creatures give themselves airs Was not I obliged to provide you with every thing  Miss  NEV  You have been very kind I always acknowledge it  Mrs  BROM  Acknowledge it Does not every body know it  Miss  NEV  Yes ma'am I dare say every body does know it  Mrs  BROM  That's maliciously said I can spy a sneer upon that false face You suppose I have made my brags That's what lurks in your ambiguous meaning I deserve it deliver me from poor relations  Miss  NEV  aside  Now the storm begins I am sure I have said nothing to offend you I am helpless it is true but your relation and by that tie a gentlewoman still  Mrs  BROM  I made you a gentlewoman Did not I take you up in the country where you lived in the parsonagehouse you and your sister with no other company to converse with than the melancholy tombstones where you read the high and mighty characters of John Hodge and Deborah his wife While your father's miserable horse worn to a shadow with carrying double to the next markettown limped about with a dull alms begging eye in quest of the wretched sustenance that grew thriftily between the graves Did not I take you out of your misery  Miss  NEV  You did ma'am  in a softened tone

bear to be insulted thus  aside  Mrs  BROM  So your spirit is humbled is it  Miss NEV  Give me leave to tell you madam that when people of superior fortune whom Providence  has enabled to bestow obligations claim a right from the favours they confer to tyrannize over the hopes and fears of a mind in distress they exercise a cruelty more barbarous than any in the whole history of human malice  Mrs  BROM  Is this your gratitude  Miss  NEV  I could be thankful for happiness if you permitted me to enjoy it but when I find myself under colour of protection made the sport of every sudden whim I have a spirit madam that can distinguish between real benevolence and the pride of riches  Mrs  BROM  O brave that is your spirit  Miss  NEV  A spirit give me leave to say that would rather in any obscure corner submit to drudgery for a slender pittance than continue to be an unhappy subject for cruelty to try its experiments upon  weeps  Mrs  BROM  I faney I have been too violent After all this sower I must sweeten her a little Come dry up your tears you know I am goodnatured in the main I am only jealous that you dont't seem to love me  Miss  NEV  Were that left to my own heart every

narrow minded woman  Exit  Mrs  BROM  Oh you little know what a profusion of goodness I have lavished on that creature She returns it all with sullenness with ill humour with aversion She perfectly remembers the affliction I was in when I lost the best of men  BYG  I have had my trials too Heigho  Mrs  BROM  I beg your pardon I am recalling your afflictions you should not give way you should struggle a little Heaven knows how I have struggled I have appeared indeed with an air but it was all struggling  looks and smiles  I could divert you this morning Do you know that your son is in love with lady Jane  BYG  In love has he said any thing  Mrs  BROM  I don't know as to that but I can see what is working in his heart He is above stairs now I don't half like his choice Lady Bell is the proper match for him and her fortune is the best An estate you know must come to her by the family settlement You should direct his choice  BYG  This comes of his presuming to think for himself Has he declared himself  Mrs  BROM  I fancy not but he hinted something to me about a match in my family  BYG  looks at her and smiles  Why a match in your family has diverted me of lateHeighoIt is the only thing that has entertained me for a long time  Mrs  BROM  I have had my fancies too I should like to talk further but I am engaged abroad this morning Can I set you down Will you trust yourselt with

your son talk to him now  Exit  Enter  Captain BYGROVE  BYG  Well Sir what brings you to this house  Capt  BYG  A morning visit Sir merely to kill half an hour  BYG  There is nothing I hate so much as hypocrisy I know your errand you must pretend to be in love  Capt  BYG  I Sir  BYG  What have you been saying to Lady Jane I thought I had cautioned you against presuming to think for yourself  Capt  BYG  You have been very kind in that way  BYG  See what comes of your friend Millamour's being left to his own discretion The ass in the fable divided in his choice and still doubting on till it is too late to resolve gives but a faint image of him  Capt  BYG  And if I Sir to avoid his irresolution  BYG  You are in the opposite extreme he thinks too much and never decides You never think at  all and so resolve without judgment Take the advice of your friends before you come here to play the antic tricks of love to kneel cringe fawn flatter and make yourself ridiculous Do you know enough of the world to judge for yourself Can you tell what they are all doing in the gay sphere of life The young are all bred up under the veterans of vice and folly The see their mothers with autumnal faces playing the agreeable and forgeting that they are no longer young The men are advanced beyond all former bounds and the women press close aster them A club for the ladies intrepidity is now the female charm to compleat their career there is nothing left but to build a turf Coterie at Newmarket and ride their own matches over the four mile course  Capt  BYG  An admirable picture Sir Dashwould could not colour it higher  Capt  BYG  Dashwould an indiscriminate railer I speak for your good and remember I tell you you know nothing of the world After all Sir Lady Bell is the person I wish to see you married togo and pay your addresses to her I will settle that matter for you you may then marry the person to whom you have not degraded yourself by pining sighing love vetses and I know not what  Capt  BYG  This is all unaccountable to me Sir If you will but hear me  Enter  MALVIL  BYG  No Sir no I won't allow you to fetch a single sigh till I say the word when I give leave you may then go and

true to my friends I see but one difficulty she will never agree to live in the country  BYG  The lover need not dispute that point whatever the husband may do hereafter  MAL  Very true and besides though I am not inclined with the malicious part of the world to suspect her virtue yet this town has temptations It grieves me to see the ways of this great city fine women without principle friends without sincerity marriages to day divorces tomorrow whole estates set upon the cast of a die masquerades without wit or humour new comedies that make you cry and tragedies that put you to sleep It grieves me to see all this You are in the right to prefer good sense and tranquility in the country  Enter  Mrs BROMLEY  and  Miss NEVILLE  Mrs  BROM  I beg your pardon gentlemen Neville mind what I say to you don't let those giddy girls go out in my absence to walk in the Green Park or run to hideous painters under pretence of seeing odious pictures that they may have an interview with more odious originals Keep them at home I will reward your pains  Allons  Mr Bygrove    Exit  BYGROVE  Come Mr Malvil  MAL  Had not I better stay and  Mrs  BROM  No no come now you may return to her  MAL  to  Miss NEVILLE  You see that I am torn from you but I shall return as soon as possible  Exit  Miss  NEV  Tyrannical woman some virtues she has but they are overshadowed by their opposite qualities Her love of praise is a gross appetite  of flattery She oppresses with kindness and her very civilities are sure to be disobliging Oh state of dependance for mere support to be subject every hour to caprice and arroganceIs it pride that makes me feel with this sensibillityNo my heart can answer it is not I can bow to the hand that relives me but I cannot stoop to the servile office of pampering vanity and ostentation with low and fulsome flattery What does Lady Bell mean by talking to me of Sir Harry She does itI know her goodnessshe does it to soften affliction and if possible divert a mind depressed with sorrow Sir Harry never threw away a thought on me He behaves indeed with marked civility but I don't know what to think of him I must not aspire too high no I have no pretensions  Enter  Lady JANE  Lady  JANE  Miss Neville I am very angry with you What is the matter Has any thing made you uneasy  Miss  NEV  No I am not remarkable for high spirits you know  Lady  JANE  Why would not you give us your company How can you be so cross That sister of mine is the veriest madcap  Miss  NEV  Lady Bell is rather lively to be sure  Lady  JANE  But when she once begins she hazards every thing and talks sometimes like a very libertine  Miss  NEV  The overflowing of gaiety and good humour  Lady  JANE  I wish she would restrain herself a little Madam La Rouge is with her she has the sweetest Point eyes ever beheld I was endeavouring to cheapen it but Lady Bell was so troublesome  she called me a thousand prudes and will have it that nothing runs in my head but a lover  Miss  NEV  I don't know but she may be right We are apt to deceive ourselves We talk of vapours and fidgets and retirement but it is often artful sly insinuating man that lurks at the bottom  Lady  JANE  Well I vow you'll make me hate you  Miss  NEV  Has Captain Bygrove made no disturbance in your heart  Lady  JANE  How can you You are as great a plague as my sister As I live and breathe the giddy romp is coming You must take my part  Enter  Lady Bell  Lady  BELL  repeating  Yes I'm in love I own it now  And Caelia has undone me  And yet I swear I can't tell how  The pleasing plague stole on me  What would I give to have some miserable swain talk in that style of me "Belinda has undone me" charming  Miss  NEV  A lively imagination is a blessing and you are happy Lady Bell  Lady  BELL  I am so but then I am not talked of I am losing all my time  Lady  JANE  Why you bold creature I hate to hear you talk with so much intrepidity  Lady  BELL  Prudery my dear sister downright pruderyl I am not for making mysteries of what all the world knows  Lady  JANE  And how do I make mysteries pray  Lady  BELL  Why you confident thing I'll prove it against you  Lady  JANE  But what what what will you prove  Lady  BELL  That you are ready to jump out of your little wits for a husband my demure sober sister Miss Neville a poet is not more eager for the success of a new comedy nor one of his brother poets more desirous to see it fail than that girl is to throw herself into the arms of a man  Lady  JANE  All scandal sister  Lady  BELL  Miss Neville shall be judge  Lady  JANE  Your story is mere invention  Lady  BELL  Was there ever such a wrangler  Lady  JANE  You'll not make good your words  Lady  BELL  pats her hand  Hold your tongue Miss will you  Lady  JANE  Very well go on  Lady  BELL  Will you have done Now mind Miss Neville She does not want to be married she says The other night my young Madam whose thoughts are always composed and even went to sleep as soon as we got to bed and then her busy imagination went to work with all the vivacity of an intriguing chambermaid  Lady  JANE  And how can you tell that pray  Lady  BELL  Out of your own mouth you shall be judged Miss Neville she talked in her sleep like a beauty in a side box and then fell a singing  No no he is true and I believe  He look'd he sigb'd he can't deceive  No no I have conquer'd he is mine  My heart is touch'd and I resign  Lady  JANE  Oh you scurrilous creature  Miss  NEV  Fairly caught Lady Jane  Lady  JANE  All odious slander you judge of me by yourself  Lady  BELL  I do so I mean to be married and am frank enough to own it But you may let "concealment feed on your damask cheek" My damask cheek I hope was made for other purposes  Lady  JANE  Gracious there is no bearing this What a mad girl you are  Lady  BELL  Not in the least A natural character One would not to be sure tell a hideous man that one loves him but when one has encouraged him by degrees and drawn him on like a new glove and perhaps done him a mischief in the doing it why then one would draw him off again and may be ask a pretty fellow to help a body and then the wretch looks so piteous and kneels at your feet then rises in a jealous fit  I take my everlasting farewell never to return no never what to her who encouraged me encouraged him who promised broke her promise The treacherous faithless dear deluding  then returns in an instant hands dangling eyes imploring tongue faultering  Lady Bell Lady Bellwhen you know that I adore you  And I burst into a fit of laughter in his face Oh that's my joy my triumph my supreme delight  Lady  JANE  And is not there a kind of cruelty in all this  Lady  BELL  Oh your very humble servant my sweet Lady Graveairs Cruelty The difference between you and me sister is this you deny your love to your female friends and own it to the man now I deny it to him but among ourselves I fairly own that Miss Neville is not more impatient to be married to Sir Harry than I to  Miss  NEV  Who I Spare me I beg of you Why Sir Harry  Lady  JANE  Now now your turn is come Never spare her sister  Mss  NEV  You must excuse me I am not in spirits for all this raillery  going  Lady  JANE  You shan't leave us  Miss  NEV  Give me leave I beg you will I'll go and talk to Madam La Rouge Perhaps I may succeed for you  Exit  Lady  JANE  Well if you must goHow you run on sister And are you really in love  Lady  BELL  Over head and ears  Lady  JANE  With whom  Lady  BELL  Not with Capt Bygrove how alarmed you are With Millamour sister  Lady  JANE  Fix that roving temper if you can he will be on his knees to you and the first pair of black eyes that enters the room will be through his heart  Lady  BELL  As to that I give myself very little trouble but if I could once catch him paying his adoration to me my aunt Bromley does not raise and sink poor Miss Neville's spirits with such exquisite skill in the art of tormenting as I should his I should use him as the men do their punch a little more sweet a little more sower a little more spirit more acid again then perhaps say it's good for nothing and then perhaps  Lady  JANE  What  Lady  BELL  Sip it up at last as you would do at first You wicked girl how could you ask me such a question Law what am I about I have a thousand things to do  Enter  Miss NEVILLE  and  Madam LA ROUGE  LA ROUGE  Ah my Lady always so gay English climate no effect upon you  De maniere de Paris  for all de vorl  En verite vous est charmante  Lady  BELL  Oh Madam La Rouge you say such polite things but you rob me of all my money  My

 La  ROU  De apartment it is ready You take it two tree week ago and pay de rent for noting I leave you vid de lady and I go mind mes affaires Bon voyage  MAL  I have disengaged myself to have the honour of attending you  Miss  NEV  Your attention is thrown away Did not I hear Mr Millamour's voice  MAL  Yes he came with me he is gone into the next room to pay his compliments to Lady Jane I am sorry to see him for ever distracted always resolving and yet every day beginning the world over again You look chagrin'd what has disturb'd you  Miss  NEV  The old story Mrs Bromley's eternal whims  MAL  She is not spoken of as I could wish Good natured and arrogant generous and cruel obliging and oppressive at the same time  Miss  NEV  There cannot surely be a more distressful situation than to remain under daily obligations and yet not be able to esteem our benefactress  MAL  Your delicacy charms me It has fixed me yours I long for nothing so much as to see you out of her power They have a strange report about town people will be talking the whisper goes that Mr Bygrove amidst all his grief is slily in a hurry for another wife Mrs Bromley they say encourages him and at the same time has a design upon my friend Millamour  Miss  NEV  The world is not always wrong  MAL  Malice will be busy and does not spare the young ladies  Miss  NEV  If any thing is said to their disadvantage believe me they do not deserve it  MAL  I dare say not I don't think they are too forward I am sorry to see in one of the papers today a character of Sir Harry not at all favourable His little follies his whims and caprices one does not mind He may walk in Dashwould's train as long as he pleases that only makes him ridiculous But it grieves me to hear that perfidy stains his character and as I am told the worst of perfidy the ruin of beauty and innocence is his ruling passion  Miss  NEV  This is very odd somebody has been at the trouble of sending me an anonymous letter to that very effect and why to me I am not able to decypher  MAL  I don't like anonymous letters In general they aim at mischief but this perhaps is meant as a caution to you it must be a friend that sent it  Miss  NEV  No I can guess the quiver from whence that arrow comes  MAL  Dashwould perhaps  Miss  NEV  I don't say that  MAL  Nor I I nevercharge any body but upon recollection the letter in the newspaper is imputed to him Mrs Bromley I know has no opinion of Sir Harry His designs with regard to you she does not think honourable My heart interests me for you You know I am all heart The plan which Mrs Bromley has proposedHark I think I hear Millamour coming I'll follow you up stairs  Miss  NEV  Oh Sir you have frighten'd me out of my wits  Exit  MAL  She loves Sir Harry I see and yet she shan't slip thro' my hands I can set on Mrs Bromley  to lead her a weary life and if I can prevail upon Millamour to renounce Lady Bell and marry the widow my business is done When Miss Neville is heartily tormented by Mrs Bromley affliction softens the mind and I may then decoy her away and stand upon terms with the family But Dashwould's wit will fly about No matter he is a sad scoundrel and does not mind how he murders reputations So here comes Millamour I must get clear of him and talk further with Miss Neville  Enter  MILLAMOUR  MIL  From this moment I blot all other woman from my memory malvil wish me joy The perplexity of choice is now at an end  MAL  Why what has happen'd  MIL  Lovely Lady Jane "And yield her charms of mind with sweet delay"I can't stay to tell you now  MAL  Nor will I stay to interrupt your raptures You know I wish you success  Exit  Enter Lady  BELL  Lady  BELL  reading  Who yields too soon must soon her lover lose  Would you restrain him long then long refuse  MIL  looks at her and smiles  There is something commanding in that air of vivacity  Lady  BELL  reads  "Oft at your door let him for entrance wait There let him" How Millamour here how could you surprize me so You horrid thing how long have you been here  MIL  Been MadamI have beenI have been in the next room paying my respects to your sister  Lady  BELL  And never enquired for poor Lady Bell  MIL  Your Ladyship wrongs me You doinjustice to your own charms they can never beforgot  Lady  BELL  I see how it is the other day you was listed in my service and now a deserter to my sister you are right you would have been upon hard duty with me  MIL  Any duty but a forlorn hope would be  Lady  BELL  Hopewhy sure you would not have had the intolerable assurance to entertain the smallest degree of hope My sister I suppose has given you some hope Ay that's her way She moves by settled rules and shines with equal light Now II am a mere comet I blaze of a sudden dazzle for a while then wheel away and am thought of no more  MIL  That gaiety of her's is charming  aside  The impression your ladyship makes  Lady  BELL  Words mere wordsNo I am a strange piece of wild nature never the same for two minutes together Now my sister she is a Prussian blue holds her colour and is always the sameII am a mere changeable silkI shift about and display my wit and my folly so curiously blended that no body can tell where one begins or the other ends I am not worth your notice  walks and hums a tune  MIL  looking at her  She has described herself admirably without variety a woman is a downright piece of insipidity  Lady  BELL  Yes I have my whims Never the same for two minutes together Now I love to give a scope to folly and the men say "curse catch her she pleases more when in the wrong than other women when they are in the right Then good sense is the word and the next moment I can't bear the fatigue of thinking why won't somebody write a comedy to divert me Then all spirit and I long to lead up the ball  Ladies like variegated tulips show  'Tis to their weakness all their charms they owe  sings and walks about  MIL  aside  Lade Jane is mere mediocrity compared to her  Lady  BELL  Lord I

not trifle with a passion sincere as mine I adore you my Lady Bell adore your matchless charms thus on my knees adore  Lady  BELL  Stay stay let me see what the poet says  reads quick  Oft at your door let him for entrance wait  There let him kneel and threaten and entreat  There stay there don't offer to stir Now put up both your hands and pray pray have compassion Lady Bell  Exit laughing  MILLAMOUR  She flies disdainful from her lover's view  Yet looks and bids him as she flies pursue  ACT the THIRD  Enter Lady  JANE  and Capt  BYGROVE  Lady JANE  AND laid his commands upon you to address my sister  Capt  BYG  Most peremptorily  Lady  JANE  You have obeyed him I hope  Capt  BYG  You know your power too well you  know that I am devoted to you and that my happiness depends upon the promise you have made me  Lady  JANE  There that is always the way with you men our smiles are sure marks of approbation and every civil thing we say is construed into a promise  Capt  BYG  And have not you promised  Lady  JANE  looks at him and smiles  Need I answer that question How easily frightened you are but you have some reason to be alarmed Millamour has been on his knees to me breathing such raptures  Capt  BYG  Aywho has set him onwhat can be at the bottom of thisAnd have you listened to himHere comes Dashwould he perhaps can explain  Lady  JANE  He will only laugh at us and so I'll make my escape  going  Capt  BYG  Not to hear Millamour again I hope  takes her hand  Lady  JANE  Well well to purchase my liberty you need not fear I have received his vows delivered with such ardourhow terrified you lookI have listened to him to alarm my sister with an idea of Millamour's growing passion for me If her jealousy is once touched it may fix her resolution At present she is as volatile as Millamour himself  Enter  DASHWOULD  DASHW  As volatile as Millamour what can that be I never knew any thing that would bear a comparison  Lady  JANE  What think you of my sister  DASHW  Lady Bell has her whims I left her above stairs in close conference with Millamour he has deserted your Ladyship already Mrs Bromley will be the next I hope your father would Captain  would grieve more for that than for his deceased wife  Lady  JANE  And then Miss Nevill's turn may come  DASH  Oh no To sport with her would be inhumanity But a brisk widow is fair game  Capt  BYG  Yes and it may help to cure my father of his folly  Lady  JANE  It would be sport but I despair of it You know Mr Dashwould you allow that Millamour has understanding  DASH  But he does not act from his understanding Fits and starts of passion govern him If in any one pursuit of real use he had half the alacrity of mind with which he runs on from one folly to another he would be a man for the ladies to pull caps for But he lives for ever in inconsistencies One action of his life is the sure forerunner of the contrary First Malvil is his favourite then arm in arm with me Can any two things be more opposite It is the same among the ladies they all have him by turns and the whim of one moment is sure to find a ridiculous antithesis in the next  Lady  JANE  He sat for that picture I'll swear Well there's a gentleman wants your advice and so I'll leave you together  Exit  Capt  BYG  My dear Dashwould you must assist me  DASH  What distresses you  Capt  BYG  My evil genius is at work You know what my father has resolved upon Lady Bell is the person he chuses for me  DASH  I know all that business a counterplot of the widow's fertile brain to disappoint Lady Bell and wreak her malice on Millamour  Capt  BYG  But the malice falls on me only Why will not Millamour know his own mind Lady Bell  loves him I know she does I am thwarted in the tenderest point what must be done  DASH  Do as they would have you you ensure success Millamour's jealousy takes fire upon the first alarm and while the passion holds he will have vigour enough to act decisively  Capt  BYG  May I hazard the Experiment  DASH  It's a sure card Take my advice  Enter Miss  NEVILLE  Miss  NEV  Mrs Bromley's coach has just stopp'd at the door had not you better step up stairs gentlemen  Enter Sir  HARRY  Sir

I did And when Mrs Bromley railed at her  DASH  She railed at her with a littleness of spirit that disgraced wealth and affluence and gave to poverty the superior character You must have seen in the behaviour of that girl though treated with pride and arrogance a propriety that was elegant and went even further it interested every heart for her She is the best of the group Were I at the head of such a fortune as yours to choose a wife she should be the object of my affection  Sir  HAR  You have some scheme in all this  DASH  I have to serve you I should mortify the pride of Mrs Bromley by placing a valuable but helpless young lady upon a level with her at once  Sir  HAR  bursts into a laugh  This is to end in some joke  DASH  Wait for the wit before you laugh I am in serious earnest Her understanding is the best among them The others are all artificial she is a natural character and if I am not mistaken has a heart If I wanted heirs to my estate she should be the mother of my children  Sir  HAR  Were I to be the dupe of all this how you would laugh at me Ha ha ha I know you too well  DASH  Again laughing without the provocation of a joke Don't be the dupe of your own cunning I know you love her and will it not be a generosity worthy of you to extricate merit out of distress Nay the merit which you admire The merit which would do honour to the choice of any man in England  Sir  HAR  Well I cannot contain  laughs heartily  DASH  What's the matter  Sir  HAR  The scrape in which you involved Millamour with the widow  DASH  Foolish that was Malvil's doing You'll hear more of it by and by There is an underplot in all his actions I advise you for the best Here is a lady in question untainted by the fashions of the age Make her your own She has no fortune what then Shew yourself superior to the sordid views that govern the little mercenary spirits of the world  Sir  HAR  laughs  I have just recollected what you said of Jack Invoice upon his marriage  DASH  Jack Invoice He never was intended for any thing but to be laughed at Upon the death of a rich uncle in the city he comes to the west end of the town with a plumb in his pocket and not an idea in his head marries a fantastical woman of rank and with a sovereign contempt of all his former acquaintance mixes with lords and people of quality  who win his money and throw his wig in the fire to divert themselves He laughs at their wit and thinks himself in good company  Sir  HAR  Admirable you have him to a hair  laughing heartily  DASH  laughing  Hey the picture is like  laughs  Pretty well is not it  Sir  HAR  Oh ho ho the very thing poor Jack Invoice you have hunted him down  DASH  Have I  laughs  Yes I think I have been pleasant upon him But come to our point in marrying Miss Neville there is nothing ridiculous You like her that's clear  Sir  HAR  But she does not like me and that's as clear Somebody has done me a prejudice there She received this letter and gave it me to read  DASH  reads  "To Miss Neville  opens it  Without a name  Sir  HAR  A poison'd arrow in the dark  DASH  reads  Anonymous letters are generally the effect of clandestine malice this comes from a friend If your honour your virtue and your peace of mind are worth your care avoid the acquaintance of Sir Harry He is the deceiver of innocence and means to add your name to the list of those whom his treachery has already ruined Make use of this hint and act accordingly  A pretty epistle  pauses  Don't I know this hand So so I understand it I can trace this say no more Sir Harry pursue Miss Neville the closer for this Will you let such a fellow as Malvil rob you of a treasure  Sir  HAR  You don't suspect him  DASH  Leave it all to me Assure Miss Neville that this shall be cleared up Hush

presently a sudden sensation I can't bear to see others made unhappy Mrs Bromley is a very valuable woman but at times rather violent  DASH  And that's much to be lamented is not it  MAL  You may laugh at it Sir but I think it a serious matter I left poor Miss Neville in a flood of tears andhere she comes  Enter  Miss NEVILLE  DASH  Not rising from table so soon  Miss  NEV  Excuse me Sir I had rather not stay  DASH  Never mind Mrs Bromley's humours come we will all take your part  Miss  NEV  I am not fit for company Sir  DASH  I am sorry to lose you I'll leave you with my worthy friend he will administer consolation  Exit  Miss  NEV  Was there ever such inhuman tyranny Insulted before the whole company  MAL  It hurts me to the quick I could not have believed her capable of such violence  Miss  NEV  You saw that I gave her no provocation  MAL  It pains me to see what I do  Miss  NEV  She breaks out in such passionate onsets and never considers that an overbearing pride is the worst of cruelty to an ingenuous mind  MAL  There are few who know how to confer an obligation A disinterested action gives such moments of inward pleasure Oh there are moments of the heart worth all the giddy pleasures of life  One benevolent action pays so amply and yields such exquisite interest that I wonder people are not fond of laying out their money in that way  Miss  NEV  During the whole time of dinner it was one continued invective against me  MAL  Millamour's behaviour had disconcerted her But that is no excuse Goodness by fits and generosity out of mere whim can never constitute a valuable character I am sorry to see you so afflicted  Miss  NEV  You are very good Sir  MAL  No I have no merit in it the instincts of my nature leave me no choice I have studied myself and I find I am only good by instict I am strangely interested for you I have thought much of your situation our time is short they will be all rising from table presently Attend to what I say since Mrs Bromley is so incessant in her tyranny do as I already hinted to you Withdraw from this house at once Madam la Rouge has an apartment ready for you You may there remain concealed In the mean time I shall be at work for you I shall prevail upon Mrs Bromley to keep her word about the five thousand pounds That added to what is in my power will make a handsome settlement for you  Miss  NEV  You heard what she said to Sir Harry  MAL  She wants to drive you to some act of despair perhaps to give you up a sacrifice to Sir Harry's loose desires  Miss  NEV  Are you so clear about Sir Harry  MAL  aside  Sdeath I see she loves himHereafter I will open a scene to astonish you  pauses and looks at her  You can never be happy under this roof Mrs Bromley will make this quarrel up I know she will The whole of her virtue consists in repentance but what kind of repentance A specious promise to reform her conduct and a certain return of the same vices  Miss  NEV  She has made me desperate I can stay here no longer I'll go back to the country I shall there be at peace  MAL  You will be there too much out of the way When you are settled at Madam La Rouge's the haughty Mrs Bromley will see to what she has driven you and for the sake of her character will begin to relent Sir Harry must not know where you are He means your ruin I am sorry to say it but I can give you such convincing proof  Enter  Mrs BROMLEY  Mrs  BROM Do you go to your room madam let me see you no more today  MAL  It was a mere unguarded word that fell from Miss Neville    speaks to  Mrs Bromley  aside    Millamour is ashamed of

receive those orders madam Your favours are so embittered there is such a leaven of pride even in your acts of bounty that I cannot wish to be under any further obligations If doing justice to Lady

terrible to your father  MIL  You know Sir that to gratify you is the height of my ambition  Sir  JOHN  For shame don't imagine that you can deceive me any longer Are you to be for ever in suspence Always resolving and yet never decided Never knowing your own mind for five minutes  MIL  I have not been hasty to determine  Sir  JOHN  My indulgence has made me too ridiculous You will force me to tell you my mind in harsher terms than I ever thought I should have occasion to do  MIL  What has happened today was but a mere frolic and it has all passed off in a little raillery  Sir  JOHN  And do you think that sufficient While you remain insensible of your folly transferring your inclinations from one object to another hurried away by every casualty you will prove the jest of all your acquaintance You will cease to live before you have begun  MIL  This is rather too much Sir If I have in a few instances departed from a resolution that seemed fixed you know very well it is not uncommon and when a person means an extraordinary leap he retires back to take advantage of the ground and spring forward with greater vigour  Sir  JOHN  And thus you amuse yourself compounding upon easy terms for the folly of every hour There is no relying upon you  MIL  After all Sir it is the prudent part to consider every thing The ladies were rather hasty in their conclusion In our moments of reflection as objects pass before us opinion will wear different colours  Sir  JOHN  The very cameleon has that merit but is there to be nothing inward No selfgoverning principle A ship without a pilot without rudder or compass is as likely to avoid rocks and quicksands as you to steer clear of ruin  MIL  You seem exasperated but I really don't see the cause  Sir  JOHN  NoCan't you feel how

Assert our rights that laughter is no sin  From the  screw'd simper  to the  broadfac'd grin  So much for self now turn we to the Poet  "KNOW YOUR OWN MIND"  Are any here who know it  To know one's mind is a hard task indeed  And harder still for us by all agreed  Cards balls beaux feathers round the eddy whirling  Change every moment while the hair is curling  The Greeks say  "Know Thyself"  I'm sure I find  I Know Myself  that I don't  Know my Mind  Know  YOU  your minds wise MenCome let us try  I have a worthy cit there in my eye  looking up  Tho' he to sneer at us takes much delight  He cannot fix where he shall go tonight  His pleasure and his peace are now at strife  He loves his bottle and he fears his wife  He'll quit this house not knowing what to do  The  Ska  espeare's Head  first gives a pull or two  But with a sideling struggle he gets thro'  Darts across Russelstreet then with new charms  The Syren Luxury his bosom warms  And draws him in the vortex of the Bedford
