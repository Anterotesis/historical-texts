 REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company Exercising the Trade and Mystery of UPHOLDERS Against Part of the BILL  For the better Viewing Searching and Examining DRUGS MEDICINES c  REASONS Humbly Offered by the COMPANY Exercising the Trade and Mystery of  UPHOLDERS    Against Part of the BILL  For the better Viewing Searching and Examining DRUGS MEDICINES c  LONDON  Printed in the YEAR  REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of UPHOLDERS against Part of the BILL  For the better Viewing Searching and Examining Drugs Medicines c  BEING call'd upon by several Retailers and Dispensers of Drugs and Medicines about Town to use our Endeavours against the Bill now depending  for Viewing  c In Regard of our common Interest and in Gratitude to the said Retailers and Dispensers of Medicines which we have always found to be  very effectual we presume to lay the following Reasons before the Publick against the said Bill  That the Company of Upholders  are far from being averse to the giving of Drugs and Medicines in general  provided they may be of such Qualities as we require and administer'd by such Persons in whom our Company justly repose the greatest Confidence And provided they tend to the Encouragement of Trade and the Consumption of the Woolen Manufacture of this Kingdom  We beg Leave to observe that  there hath been no Complaint from any of the Nobility Gentry and Citizens whom we have attended  Our Practice which consists chiefly in outward Applications having been always so effectual that none of our Patients have been oblig'd to undergo a second Operation Excepting one Gentlewoman who after her first Burial having burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of posthumous Children her second Funeral was by us perform'd without any further Charges to  the said Husband of the deceas'd And we humbly hope that one single Instance of this Kind a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of a Sexton in cutting off a Ring will not be imputed to any Want of Skill or Care in our Company  We humbly conceive that this  Power    by this Bill lodged in the Censors of the College of Physicians  to restrain any of His Majesty's Subjects from dispensing and welldisposed Persons from taking what Medicines they please  is a manifest Encroachment on the Liberty and Property of the Subjects  As the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of Upholders have an undisputed Right in and upon the Bodies of all and every the Subjects of the Kingdom we conceive the passing of this Bill though not absolutely depriving them of their said Right might keep them out of Possession by unreasonable Delays to the great Detriment of our Company and their numerous Families  We hope it will be consider'd that there are Multitudes of necessitous Heirs and penurious Parents Persons in pinching Circumstances with numerous Families of Children Wives that have lived long many robust aged Women with great Jointures elder Brothers with bad Understandings single Heirs of great Estates whereby the Collateral Line are for ever excluded Reversionary Patents and Reversionary Promises of Preferments Leases upon Single Lives and Playdebts upon joint Lives and that the Persons so agrieved have no Hope of being speedily relieved any other Way than by the dispensing of Drugs and Medicines in the Manner they now are Burying alive being judg'd repugnant to the know Laws of this Kingdom  That there are many of the Deceased who by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are carried about Town who would have been put into our Hands long before this Time by any other wellordered Government by want of a  due Police in this Particular our Company have been great Sufferers  That frequent Funerals contribute to preserve the Genealogies of Families and the Honours conferred by the Crown which are no where so well illustrated as on this solemn Occasion to maintain necessitous Clergy to enable the Clerks to appear in decent Habits to officiate on  Sundays  to feed the great Retinue of sober and melancholy Men who appear at the said Funerals and who must starve without constant and regular Employment Moreover we desire it may be remember'd that by the passing of this Bill the Nobility and Gentry will have their old Coaches lie upon their Hands which are now employed by our Company  And we further hope that frequent Funerals will not be discouraged as is by this Bill proposed it being the only Method left of  carrying  some People to Church  We are afraid that by the Hardships of this  Bill our Company will be reduced to leave their Business here and  practise at  York  and  Bristol  where the free Use of bad Medicines will be still allowed  It is therefore hoped that no specious Pretence whatsoever will be thought sufficient to introduce an Arbitrary and unlimited Power for People to live  in Defiance of Art as long as they can by the Course of Nature to the Prejudice of our Company and the Decay of Trade  That as our Company are like to suffer in some measure by the Power given to Physicians to dissect the Bodies of Malefactors we humbly hope that the Manufacture of Cases for Skeletons will be reserved solely to the Coffinmakers  We likewise humbly presume that the Interests of the several Trades and Professions which depend upon ours may be regarded such as that of the Makers of Hearses Coaches Coffins Epitaphs and Bellropes Stonecutters  Feathermen and Bellringers and especially the Manufacturers of Crapes and the Makers of Snuff who use great Quantities of oldCoffins and who considered in the Consumption of their Drugs employ by far the greatest Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the Kingdom  FINIS
