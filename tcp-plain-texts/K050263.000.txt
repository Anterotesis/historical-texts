 AND What if the  Pretender  should come OR SOME CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ADVANTAGES AND Real Consequences OF THE PRETENDER's Possessing the CROWN OF  GreatBritain  ondon  Printed and Sold by  J Baker  at the  Black Boy  in  Paternosterrow  Price  d    And what if the Pretender should come OR SOME Considerations  c  IF the Danger of the Pretender is really so great as the Noise which some make about it seems to suppose if the Hopes of his Coming are so well grounded as some of his Friends seem to boast it behoves us who are to be the Subjects of the Approaching Revolution which his Success must necessarily bring with it to apply ourselves seriously to examine what our Part will be in the Play that so we may prepare ourselves to act as becomes us both with Respect to the Government we are now under and with Respect to the Government we may be under when the Success he promises himself shall if ever it shall answer his Expectation  In order to this it is necessary to state with what Plainness the Circumstances of the Case will admit the several Appearances of the Thing itself  As they are  offered to us by the respective Parties who are for or against it  As they  really appear by an Impartial Deduction from them both without the least Byass either to one Side or other that so the People of  Britain  may settle and compose their Thoughts a little in this Great and at present Popular Debate and may neither be terrified or affrighted with Mischiefs which have no Reason or Foundation in them and which give no Ground for their Apprehensions and on the other Hand may not promise to themselves greater Things from the Pretender if he should come hither than he will be able to perform for them in order to this we are to consider the Pretender in his Person and in his Circumstances The Person who we call the Pretender It has been so much debated and such strong Parties have been made on both Sides to prove or disprove the Legitimacy of his Birth that it seems needless here to enter into that Dispute the Author of the  Review  one of the most Furious Opposers of the Name and Interest of the Pretender openly grants his Legitimacy and pretends to argue  against his Admission from Principles and Foundations of his own Forming we shall let alone his Principles and Foundations here as we do his Arguments and only take him by the Handle which he fairly gives us  viz  that he grants  the Person of the Pretender Legitimate  if this be so if the Person we contend about be the Lawful true Son of King  James  's Queen the Dispute whether he be the Real Son of the King will be quite out of the Question because by the Laws of  GreatBritain  and of the whole World a Child Born in Wedlock shall inherit as Heir of the Mother's Husband whether Begotten by him as his Real Father or not Now to come at the true Design of this Work the Business is to hear as above what either Side have to say to this Point The Friends of his Birth and Succession argue upon it thus if the Person be lawfully Begotten  that is  if Born really of the Body of the Queen  Dowager  during the Life of King  James  he was without any Exception his Lawful Son  if  he was his Lawful Son he was his Lawful Heir  if  he was his Lawful Heir why is he not our Lawful King  Since  Hereditary Right is Indefeasible and is lately acknowledged to be so and that the Doctrine of Hereditary Right being Indefeasible is a Church of  England  Doctrine  ever received by the Church and inseparable from the true Members of the Church the contrary being the stigmatizing Character of Republicans Kingkillers Enemies to Monarchy Presbyterians and Phanaticks The Enemies of the Birth and Succession of the Person called the Pretender argue upon it thus  That  he is the Lawfully Begotten or Son Born really of the Body of the Queen  Dowager  of the late King  James    they doubt  and they are justified in doubting of it because no sufficient Steps were taken in the proper Season of it  either before his Birth  to convince such Persons as were more immediately concerned to know the Truth of it that the Queen was really with Child which might have been done past all Contradiction at that Time more than ever after  Or at his Birth  to have such Persons as were more immediately concern'd  such as Her Present Majesty  c thoroughly convinc'd of the Queen being really deliver'd of a Child by being Present at the Time of the Queen's Labour and Delivery This being omitted which was the Affirmative  say they  which ought to have been proved we ought not to be concerned in the Proof of the Negative which by the Nature of the Thing could not be equally certain and therefore we might be justly permitted to conclude that the Child was  a Spurious Unfair Production put upon the Nation for which Reason we reject him and have now by a Legal and Just Authority deposed his Father and him and settled the Succession upon the House of  Hanover  being Protestants  The Matter of his Title standing thus divides the Nation into Two Parties one Side for and the other against the Succession either of the Pretender or the House of  Hanover  and either Side calling the other the Pretender so that if we were to use the Parties Language we must say one Side is for and the other Side against either of the  Pretenders  what the Visible Probabilities of either of these Claims succeeding are is not the Present Case the Nation appears at this Time strangely agitated between the Fears of one Party and the Hopes of the other each extenuating and aggravating as their several Parties and Affections guide them by which the Publick Disorder is very much encreased what either of them have to alledge is our present Work to enquire but more particularly what are the real or pretended Advantages of the expected Reign of him who we are allow'd to distinguish by the Name of  the Pretender  for his Friends here would have very little to say to move us to receive him if they were not able to lay before us such Prospects  of National Advantages and such Views of Prosperity as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their Eyes upon the Good of their Country and of their Posterity after them  That then a Case so Popular and of so much Consequence as this is may not want such due Supports as the Nature of the Thing will allow and especially since the Advantages and good Consequences of the Thing itself are so many and so easie to be seen as his Friends alledge why should not the Good People of  Britain  be made easie and their Fears be turned into Peaceable Satisfaction by seeing that this Devil may not be so Black as he is Painted and that the Noise made of the Pretender and the frightful Things said of his Coming and of his being receiv'd here may not be made greater Scarecrows to us than they really are and  after all that has been said    if  it should appear that the Advantages of the Pretender's Succession are really greater to us and the Dangers less to us than those of the Succession of  HANOVER  then much of their Difficulties would be over who standing Neuter as to Persons appear against the Pretender only because they are made to believe strange and terrible Things of what shall befal the Nation in Case of his Coming in  such as  Popery Slavery  French  Power  destroying of our Credit and devouring our Funds as that Scandalous Scribler the  Review  has been labouring to suggest with many other Things which we shall endeavour to expose to you as they deserve  If  we say it should appear then that the Dangers and Disadvantages of the Pretender's Succession are less than those of the House of  HANOVER  who because of an Act of Parliament you know must not be called  Pretenders  then there will remain nothing more to be said on that Score but the Debate must be of the Reasonableness and Justice on either Side for their Admittance and there we question not but the Side we are really pleading for will have the Advantage  To begin then with that most Popular and Affrighting Argument now made Use of as the Bugbear of the People against several other Things besides Jacobitism we mean  French Greatness  It is most evident that the Fear of this must by the Nature of the Thing be effectually removed upon our receiving  the Pretender  the Grounds and Reasons why  French  Greatness is rendred Formidable to us and so much Weight supposed to be in it that like the Name of  Scanderberg  we fright our very Children with it lye only in this that we suggest the King of  France  being a profest  Enemy to the Peace and the Liberty of  GreatBritain  will most certainly as soon as he can a little recover himself exercise all that Formidable Power to put the Pretender upon us and not only to place him upon the Throne of  GreatBritain  but to Maintain and Hold him up in it against all the Opposition either of the People of  Britain  or the Confederate Princes Leagued with the Elector of  Hanover  who are in the Interest of his Claim or of his Party Now it is evident that upon a Peaceable admitting this Person whom they call the Pretender to Receive and Enjoy the Crown here all that Formidable Power becomes your Friend and  the being so  must necessarily take off from it every Thing that is called Terrible forasmuch as the greater Terror and Amusement the Power we apprehend really carries with it the greater is the Tranquility and Satisfaction which accrues to us when we have the Friendship of that Power which was so Formidable to us before The Power of  France  is represented at this Time very terrible and the Writers who speak of it apply it warm to our Imaginations as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the Impossibility of keeping out the Pretender and this notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same Time to suppose all the Confederate  Powers of  Europe  to be Engaged as well by their own Interest as by the New Treaties of Barrier and Guarantee to Support and to Assist the Claim of the Elector of  Hanover  and his Party Now if this Power be so Great and so Formidable as they alledge will it not on the other Side add a Proportion of Encrease to our Satisfaction that this Power will be wholly in Friendship and League with us and engaged to concern itself for the quieting our Fears of other Foreign Invaders forasmuch as having once concern'd itself to set the Person of the Pretender upon the Throne it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concern'd to Support and Maintain him in that Possession as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other Projects of his Greatness and Glory with the rest of  Europe  in which it will be very much his Interest to secure himself from any Opposition he might meet with from this Nation or from such as might be rendred Powerful by our Assistance An Eminent Instance we have of this in the Mighty Efforts the  French  Nation have made for Planting and Preserving when Planted a Grandson of  France  upon the Throne of  Spain  and how Eminent are the Advantages to  France  from the Success of that Undertaking of what less Consequence then would it be to  the August Monarchy of  France  to Secure and Engage to himself the constant Friendship and Assistance of the Power of  GreatBritain  which he would necessarily do by the placing this Person upon the Throne who would thereby in Gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in Return to the King of  France  for the carrying on his Glorious Designs in the rest of  Europe  While then we become thus necessary to the King of  France  Reason dictates that he would be our Fast Friend our Constant Confederate our Allie firmly engaged to Secure our Sovereign and Protect our People from the Insults and Attempts of all the World Being thus engaged reciprocally with the King of  France  there must necessarily be an End of all the Fears and Jealousies of all the Apprehensions and Doubts which now so Amuse us and appear so Formidable to us from the Prospect of the Power and Greatness of  France  then we shall on the contrary say to the World the stronger the King of  France  is the better for the King of  England  and what is best for the King must be so for his People for it is a most unnatural Way of Arguing to suppose the Interest of a King and of his People to be different from one another  And is not this then an Advantage incomparably greater to  Britain  when the Pretender shall be upon the Throne than any we can propose to ourselves in the present uneasie Posture of Affairs which it must be acknowledged we are in now when we cannot sleep in Quiet for the terrible Apprehensions of being overrun by the Formidable Power of  France  Let us also consider the many other Advantages which may accrue to this Nation by a nearer Conjunction and closer Union with  France  such as Encrease of Commerce Encouragement of Manufactures Ballance of Trade every one knows how vast an Advantage we reaped by the  French  Trade in Former Times and how many Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year we gain'd by it when the Ballance of Trade between us and  France  run so many Millions of  Livres  Annually  against  the  French  by the vast Exportation of our Goods to them and the small Import which we receiv'd from them again and by the Constant Flux of Money in  Specie  which we drew from them every Year upon Court Occasions to the inexpressible Benefit of the Nation and Enriching of the Subject of which we shall have Occasion to speak hereafter more fully  In the mean Time it were to be wished that our People who are so bugbear'd with Words and terrified with the Name of  French    French Power    French Greatness  and the like as if  England  could not Subsist and the Queen of  England  was not Able to keep upon Her Throne any longer than the King of  France  pleased and that Her Majesty was going to be a meer Servant to the  French  King would consider that this is an unanswerable Argument for the Coming of the Pretender that we may make this so Formidable Prince our Friend have all his Power engaged in our Interest and see him going on Hand in Hand with us in the securing us against all Sorts of Encroachments whatsoever For if the King of  France  be such an Invincible Mighty Monarch that we are nothing in his Eyes or in his Hands and that neither  Britain  or all the Friends  Britain  can make are able to deliver us from him then it must be our great Advantage to have the Pretender be our King that we may be out of the Danger of this Formidable  French  Power being our Enemy and that on the other Hand we may have so Potent so Powerful so Invincible a Prince be our Friend The Case is evidently laid down to every common Understanding in the Example of  Spain    till now  the  Spaniards  for many Ages have been overrun  and impoverished by their continued Wars with the  French  and it was not doubted but one Time or other they would have been entirely conquered by the King of  France  and have become a meer Province of  France  whereas now having but consented to receive a King from the Hands of the invincible Monarch they are made easie as to the former Danger they were always in are now most safe under the Protection of  France  and he who before was their Terror is now their Safety and being safe from him it appears they are so from all the World  Would it not then be the manifest Advantage of this Nation to be likewise secur'd from the dangerous Power of  France  and make that Potentate our fast Friend who it is so apparent we are not able to resist as an Enemy This is reducing the  French  Power the softest Way if not the best and shortest Way for if it does not reduce the Power itself it brings it into such a Circumstance as that all the Terror of it is removed and we embrace that as our Safety and Satisfaction which really is and ought to be our Terror and Aversion this must of Necessity be our great Advantage  How strange is it that none of our People have yet thought of this Way of securing their Native Country from the Insults of  France  Were but the Pretender once received as our King we have no more Disputes with the King of  France  he has no Pretence to Invade or Disturb us what a quiet World would it be with us in such a Case when the greatest Monarch in the Universe should be our fast Friend and be in our Interest to prevent any of the Inconveniencies which might happen to us from the Disgust of other Neighbours who may be dissatisfied with us upon other Accounts As to the terrible Things which some Peo+ple fright us and themselves with from the Influence which  French  Councils may have upon us and of  French  Methods of Government being introduced among us these we ought to esteem only Clamours and Noise raised by a Party to amuse and affright us for pray let us enquire a little into them and see if there be any Reason for us to be so terrified at them suppose they were really what is alledged which we hope they are not  for Example  the absolute Dominion of the King of  France  over his Subjects is such say our People as makes them Miserable well but let us examine then are we not already miserable for Want of this Absolute Dominion Are  we not miserably divided Is not our Government miserably weak Are we not miserably subjected to the Rabbles and Mob Nay is not the very Crown mobb'd here every now and then into whatever our Soveraign Lord the People demand whereas on the contrary we see  France  entirely united as one Man no virulent Scriblers there dare Affront the Government no Impertinent P  ments there disturb the Monarch with their Addresses and Representations no Superiority of Laws restrain the Administration no Insolent Lawyers talk of the Sacred Constitution in Opposition to the more Sacred Prerogative but all with Harmony and General Consent agree to Support the Majesty of their Prince and with their Lives and Fortunes not in Complimenting Sham Addresses only but in Reality and effectually Support the Glory of their Great Monarch In doing this they are all united together so firmly as if they had but one Heart and one Mind and that the King was the Soul of the Nation What if they are  what we foolishly call  Slaves to the Absolute Will of their Prince That Slavery to them is meer Liberty they entertain no Notions of that foolish Thing  Liberty  which we make so much Noise about nor have they any Occasion of it or any Use for it if they had  it they are as Industrious in Trade as Vigorous in Pursuit of their Affairs go on with as much Courage and are as well satisfied when they have wrought hard or Years to get a little Money for the King to take away as we are to get it for our Wives and Children and as they plant Vines and plow Lands that the King and his Great Men may eat the Fruit thereof they think it as great a Felicity as if they Eat it themselves The Badge of their Poverty which we make such a Noise of and Insult them about so much  viz  their Wooden Shoes their Peasants make nothing of it they say they are as happy in their Wooden Shoes as our People are with their Luxury and Drunkenness besides do not our Poor People wear Iron Shoes and Leather Doublets and where is the Odds between them All the Business forsooth is this Trifle we call Liberty which rather than be plagued with so much Strife and Dissention about it as we are who would be troubled with Now it is evident  the Peace  and  Union  which we should enjoy under the like Methods of Government here which we hope for under the Happy Government of the Pretender must needs be a full Equivalent for all the pretended Rights and Priviledges which we say we shall loose and how will our Rights and  Privileges be lost Will they not rather be Centred in our Common Receptacle  viz  the Sovereign who is according to the King of  France  's happy Government the Common Magazine of Universal Privilege communicating it to and preserving it for the general Use of his Subjects as their Safety and Happiness requires Thus he protects their Commerce encourages their Foreign Settlements enlarges their Possessions Abroad encreases their Manufactures gives them Room for spreading their numerous Race over the World at Home he rewards Arts and Sciences cultivates Learning employs innumerable Hands in the Labours of the State and the like what if it be true that all they Gain is at his Mercy Does he take it away except when needful for the Support of his Glory and Grandeur which is their Protection Is it not apparent that under all the Oppressions they talk so much of the  French  are the Nation the most Improved and Encreased in Manufactures in Navigation in Commerce within these Years of any Nation in the World And here we pretend Liberty Property Constitutions Rights of Subjects and such Stuff as that and with all these fine Gewgaws which we pretend propagate Trade and  encrease the Wealth of the Nation we are every Day Declining and become Poor how long will this Nation be blinded by their own foolish Customs And when will they learn to know that the Absolute Government of a Vertuous Prince who makes the Good of his People his Ultimate End and esteems their Prosperity his Glory is the Best and most Godlike Government in the World  Let us then be no more rendred uneasie with the Notions that with the Pretender we must entertain  French  Methods of Government such as Tyranny and Arbitrary Power Tyranny is no more Tyranny when improv'd for the Subjects Advantage perhaps when we have tried it we may find it as much for our Good many Ways nay and more too than our present Exorbitant Liberties especially unless we can make a better Use of them and Enjoy them without being always going by the Ears about them as we see daily not only with our Governours but even with one another a little  French Slavery  though it be a frightful Word among us  that is  being made so by Custom yet may do us a great deal of Good in the Main as it may teach us not to  Over  Under  Value  our Liberties when we have them so much as sometimes we have done and this is not one of  the least Advantages which we shall gain by the Coming of the Pretender and consequently one of the good Reasons why we should be very willing to receive him  The next Thing which they fill us with Apprehensions of in the Coming of the Pretender is the Influence of  French  Councils which they Construe thus  viz  That the Pretender being restor'd here by the Assistance of  France  will not only Rule us by  French  Methods  viz  by  French  Tyranny but in Gratitude to his Restorer he will cause us to be always ready with  English  Blood and Treasure to Assist and Support the  French  Ambition in the Invasions he will ever be making upon  Europe  and in the Oppressions of other Nations till at last he obtain the Superiority over them all and turn upon us too devouring the Liberties of  Europe  in his so long purposed and resolved  Universal Monarchy  As to the Gratitude of the Pretender to the King of  France  why should you make that a Crime Are not all People bound in Honour to retaliate Kindness And would you have your Prince be ungrateful to him that brought him hither By the same Rule you would expect he could be ungrateful to us that receive him besides if it be so great an Advantage to us to have him brought in we shall be all concern'd also in Gratitude  to the King of  France  for helping us to him and sure we shall not decline making a suitable Return to him for the Kindness and is this any Thing more than common Did we not pay the  Dutch  Six Hundred Thousand Pound  Sterling  for assisting the Late King  William  And did we not immediately Embark with them in the War against the King of  France  And has not that Revolution cost the Nation One Hundred Millions of  British  Money to Support it And shall we grutch to Support the Pretender and his Benefactor at the same Expence if it should be needful for carrying on the New Scheme of  French  Liberty which when that Time comes may be in a likely and forward Way to prevail over the whole World to the General Happiness of  Europe  There seems to be but one Thing more which those People who make such a Clamour at the Fears of the Pretender take hold of and this is Religion and they tell us that not only  French  Government and  French  Influence but  French  Religion that is to say  Popery  will come upon us but these People know not what they talk of for it is evident that they shall be so far from being loaden with Religion that they will rather obtain that so long desired Happiness of having no Religion at all This  we may easily make appear has been the Advantage which has been long labour'd for in this Nation and as the Attainments we are arriv'd to of that Kind are very considerable already so we cannot doubt but that if once the Pretender were settled quietly among us an Absolute Subjection as well of Religious Principles as Civil Liberties to the Disposal of the Sovereign would take Place This is an Advantage so fruitful of several other manifest Improvements that though we have not Room in this Place to enlarge upon the Particulars we cannot doubt but it must be a most grateful Piece of News to a great Part of the Nation who have long groan'd under the Oppressions and cruel Severities of the Clergy occasion'd by their own strict Lives and rigorous Virtue and their imposing such Austerities and Restraints upon the People and in this Particular the Clamour of Slavery will appear very scandalous in the Nation for the Slavery of Religion being taken off and an Universal Freedom of Vice being introduced what greater Liberty can we enjoy  But we have yet greater Advantages attending this Nation by the Coming of the Pretender than any we have yet taken Notice of and though we have not Room in  this short Tract to name them all and enlarge upon them as the Case may require yet we cannot omit such due Notice of them as may serve to satisfie our Readers and convince them how much they ought to favour the Coming of the Pretender as the great Benefit to the whole Nation and therefore we shall begin with our Brethren of  Scotland  and here we may tell them that they of all the Parts of this Island shall receive the most evident Advantages in that the setting the Pretender upon the Throne shall effectually set them free from the Bondage they now groan under in their abhorr'd Subjection to  England  by the  Union    which  may no question be declar'd Void and Dissolv'd as a Violence upon the  Scottish  Nation as soon as ever the Pretender shall be Established upon the Throne a few Words may serve to recommend this to the  Scots  since we are very well satisfied we shall be sure to oblige every Side there by it The Opposition all Sides made to the Union at the Time of the Transaction of the Union in the Parliament there cannot but give us Reason to think thus and the present Scruple even the Presbyterians themselves make of taking the Abjuration if they do not as some pretend assure us that the said Presbyterian Nonjurers are in the Interest of the Pretender  yet they undeniably prove and put it out of all question that they are illpleased with the Yoke of the Union and would embrace every just Occasion of being quietly and freely discharged from the Fetters which they believe they bear by the said Union now there is no Doubt to be made but that upon the very first Appearance of the Pretender the Antient Kingdom of  Scotland  should recover her former wellknown Condition we mean of being perfectly free and depending upon none but the King of  France    How  Inestimable an Advantage this will be to  Scotland  and how effectually he will Support and Defend the  Scots  against their Antient Enemies the  English  forasmuch as we have not Room to enlarge upon here we may take Occasion to make out more particularly on another Occasion But it may not be forgotten here that the Union was not only justly Distasteful to the  Scots  themselves but also to many Good Men and Noble Patriots of the Church some of whom entred their Protests against Passing and Confirming or Ratifying the same such as the late Lord  Hav  sham  and the Right Wise and Right Noble E  of  Nott  whose Reasons for being against the said  Union    besides those they gave in the House of P    which we do by  no Means mean or reflect upon in the least in this Place  we say whose other Reasons for opposing the said Union were founded upon an Implacable Hatred to the  Scots  Kirk which has been Established thereby It may then not admit of any Question but that they would think it a very great Advantage to be delivered from the same as they would effectually be by the Coming of the Pretender wherefore by the concurring Judgment of these Noble and Wise Persons who on that Account opposed the  Ʋnion  the Coming of the Pretender must be an Inexpressible Advantage to this Nation nor is the dissolving the Union so desirable a Thing meerly as that Union was an Establishing among us a Wicked Schismatical Presbyterian Generation and giving the Sanction of the Laws to their Odious Constitution which we Esteem you know worse than Popery but even on Civil Accounts as particularly on Account of the P  s of  Scotland  who many of them think themselves Egregiously maltreated and robb'd of their Birthright as P  s and have express'd themselves so in a something Publick Manner Now we cannot think that any of these will be at all offended that all this New Establishment should be revoked nay we have heard it openly said that the  Scots  are  so little satisfied with the  Ʋnion  at this Time that if it were now to be put to the Vote as it was before whether they should Unite with  England  or no there would not be one Man in Fifteen throughout  Scotland  that would Vote for it  If then  it appears that the whole Nation thus seems to be averse to the Union and by the Coming in of this most Glorious Pretender that Union will be in all Appearance dissolved and the Nation freed from the Encumbrance of it will any  Scots  Man who is against the Union refuse to be for the Pretender Sure it cannot be I know it is alledged that they will lay aside their Discontent at the Union and Unite together against the Pretender because that is to Unite against Popery we will not say what a few who have their Eyes in their Heads may do but as the Generality of the People there are not so well reconciled together as such a Thing requires it is not unlikely that such a Uniting may be prevented if the Pretender's Friends there can but play the Game of dividing them farther as they should do to which End it cannot but be very serviceable to them to have the real Advantages of receiving the Pretender laid before them which is the true Intent and Meaning of the Present Undertaking  But we have more and greater Advantages of the Coming of the Pretender and such as no question will invite you to receive him with great Satisfaction and Applause and it cannot be unnecessary to inform you for your Direction in other Cases how the Matter as to Real and Imaginary Advantage stands with the Nation in this Affair and  First  The Coming of the Pretender will at once put us all out of Debt These AbominationWhigs and these Bloody Wars carried on so long for little or nothing  have  as is evident to our Senses  now  whatever it was all along brought a heavy Debt upon the Nation so that if what a known Author lately Published is true the Government pays now almost Six Millions a Year to the Common People for Interest of Money that is to say the Usurers Eat up the Nation and Devour Six Millions Yearly which is paid and must be paid now for a long Time if some  kind Turn  such as this of the Coming of the Pretender or such like does not help us out of it the Weight of this is not only Great insuperably Great but most of it is entailed for a terrible Time not only for our Age but beyond the Age of our Grandchildren even for Ninetynine Years By how much the Consideration of this Debt is Intolerable and  Afflicting to the last Degree by so much the greater must the Obligation be to the Person who will Ease the Nation of such a Burthen and therefore we place it among the Principal Advantages which we are to receive from the Admission of the Pretender that he will not fail to rid us of this Grievance and by Methods peculiar to himself deliver us from so great a Burthen as these Debts are now and unless he deliver us are like to be to the Ages to come Whither he will do this at once by remitting most Graciously to the Nation the whole Payment and consequently take off the Burthen  Brevi Manu  as with a Spunge wiping out the Infamous Score leaving it to fall as Fate directs or by prudent Degrees we know not nor is it our Business to determine it here no Doubt the doing it with a Jerk as we call it  Comme une Coup de Grace  must be the most expeditious Way nay and the kindest Way of putting the Nation out of its Pain for lingering Deaths are counted cruel and tho'  Ʋne coup d'Eclat  may make an Impression for the Present yet the Astonishment is soonest over besides where is the Loss to the Nation in this Sense Tho' the Money be stopt from the Subject on one Hand if it be stopt to the Subjects on the other the Nation Loses or Gains Nothing we  know if will be Answer'd that it is unjust and that Thousands of Families will be ruin'd because they who Loose will not be those who Gain But what is this to the Purpose in a National Revolution unjust Alas Is that an Argument Go and ask the Pretender Does not he say you have all done unjustly by him And since the Nation in general loses Nothing what Obligation has he to regard the particular Injury that some Families may sustain And yet farther is it not remarkable that most Part of the Money is paid by the Cursed Party of Whigs who from the Beginning officiously appear'd to keep him from his Right And what Obligation has he upon him to concern himself for doing them Right in Particular more than other People But to avoid the Scandal of Partiality there is another Thought offers to our View which the Nation is beholding to a Particular Author for putting us in Mind of if it be unjust that we should suppose the Pretender shall stop the Payment on both Sides because it is doing the Whigs Wrong since the Tories who perhaps being chiefly Landed Men pay the most Taxes then to keep up a just Ballance he need only continue the Taxes to be paid in and only stop the Annuities and Interest which are to be paid out  Thus both Sides having no Reason to Envy or Reproach one another with Hardships or with suffering Unequally they may every one lose their Proportion and the Money may be laid up in the Hands of the New Sovereign for the Good of the Nation  This being thus happily proposed we cannot pass over the great Advantages which would accrue to this Nation in such a Case by having such a Mass of Money laid up in the  Exchequer  at the Absolute Command of a most Gracious  French  Sovereign But as these Things are so Glorious and so Great as to admit of no compleat Explication in this short Tract give us Leave  O People  of  GreatBritain  to lay before you a little Scetch of your future Felicity under the Auspicious Reign of such a Glorious Prince as we all hope and believe the Pretender to be You are to allow that by such a Just and Righteous shutting up of the  Exchequer  in about Seven Years Time he may be supposed to have received about Forty Millions Sterling from his People which not being to be found in  Specie  in the Kingdom will for the Benefit of Circulation enable him to Treasure up Infinite Funds of Wealth in Foreign Banks a prodigious Mass of Foreign Bullion Gold Jewels and  Plate to be ready in the  Tower  or elsewhere to be issued upon Future Emergency as Occasion may allow This prodigious Wealth will necessarily have these happy Events to the Infinite Satisfaction and Advantage of the whole Nation and the Benefit of which I hope none will be so Unjust or Ungrateful to deny It will for ever after deliver this Nation from the Burthen the Expence the Formality and the Tyranny of Parliaments No one can perhaps at the first View be rightly sensible of the many Advantages of this Article and from how many Mischiefs it will deliver this Nation How the Countrey Gentlemen will be no longer harrass'd to come at the Command of every Court Occasion and upon every Summons by the Prince's Proclamation from their Families and other Occasions whether they can be spared from their Wives  c  or no or whether they can trust their Wives behind them or no nay whether they can spare Money or no for the Journey or whether they must come  Carriage Paid  or no  then  they will no more be unnecessarily exposed to Long and Hazardous Journeys in the Depth of Winter from the remotest Corners of the Island to come to  London  just to give away the Countrey's Money and go Home again all this will  be dispenced with by the Kind and Gracious Management of the Pretender when he  God bless us  shall be our more Gracious Sovereign In the happy Consequence of the Demise of Parliaments the Countrey will be eased of that intolerable Burthen of Travelling to Elections sometimes in the Depth of Winter sometimes in the Middle of their Harvest whenever the Writs of Elections Arbitrarily Summons them And with them the Poor Gentlemen will be eased of that abominable Grievance of the Nation  viz  the Expence of Elections by which so many Gentlemen of Estates have been Ruin'd so many innocent People of honest Principles before have been Debauched and made Mercenary Partial Perjur'd and been Blinded with Bribes to Sell their Countrey and Liberties to who bids most It is well known how often and yet how in vain this Distemper has been the constant Concern of Parliaments for many Ages to Cure and to provide sufficient Remedies for Now if ever the effectual Remedy for this is found out to the inexpressible Advantage of the whole Nation and this perhaps is the only Cure for it that the Nature of the Disease will admit of what terrible Havock has this kind of Trade made among  the Estates of the Gentry and the Morals of the Common People How also has it kept alive the Factions and Divisions of the Countrey People keeping them in a Constant Agitation and in Triennial Commotions So that what with Forming New Interests and Cultivating Old the Heats and Animosities never cease among the People But once set the Pretender upon the Throne and let the Funds be but happily stopt and paid into his Hands that he may be in no more Need of a Parliament and all these Distempers will be cur'd as effectually as a Feaver is cur'd by cutting off the Head or as a Halter cures the Bleeding at the Nose How Infatuated then is this Nation that they should so obstinately refuse a Prince by the Nature of whose Circumstances and the avowed Principles of whose Party we are sure to obtain such Glorious Things such Inestimable Advantages Things which no Age no Prince no Attempt of Parties or Endeavour though often aim'd at of Ministers of State have ever been able to procure for us This Amassing of Treasure by the stopping the Funds on one Hand and the receiving the Taxes on the other will effectually enable the Pretender to set up and effectually maintain that Glorious and so oftendesir'd Method  of Government  Au Coup de Cannon    Anglice  a Standing Army This we have the Authority of the Antient Borough of  Carlisle  that it is the Safety of the Prince and the Glory of the Nation as appears by their Renowned Address to King  James  II Then we should see a new Face of our Nation and  Britain  would no more be a naked Nation as it has formerly been then we should have Numerous and Gallant Armies surrounding a Martial Prince ready to make the World as well as his own Subjects tremble then our Inland Counties would appear full of Royal Fortifications Citadels Forts and Strong Towns the Beauty of the Kingdom and Awe of Factious Rebels It is a strange Thing that this Refractory People of ours could never be made sensible how much it is for the Glory and Safety of this Nation that we should be put into a Posture of Defence  against ourselves  It has been often alledged that  this Nation can never be ruin'd but with their own Consent  If then we are our own Enemies is it not highly requisite that we should be put in a Condition to have our Ruin prevented And that since it is apparent we are no more fit to be trusted with our own Liberties having a Natural and a National Propensity to destroy and undo ourselves and may be  brought to Consent to our own Ruin we should have such Princes as for the future know how to restrain us and how reasonable is it to allow them Forces  to do so  We might enlarge here upon the Great and Certain Advantages of this best of Governments  a Standing Army  we might go back to the  Persian    Grecian  and  Roman  Empires which had never arriv'd to such a Pitch of Glory if the People and Nations who they subdued had been able to Nose them with such Trifles as what we call Constitution National Right Antient Privileges  and the like  we might descend also to particular Advantages of Government which it is hoped we may attain to in  Britain  when the Pretender arrives some of which are grown Obsolete and out of Use by Custom and long Possession of those troublesome Things call'd Liberties among these may be reckoned  The whole Kingdom will be at once eased of that ridiculous Feathercaps Expence of Militia and Train'dbands which serve for little else but to justifie the Picking the Peoples Pockets with an Annual Tax of TrophyMoney and every now and then putting the City of  London  and Parts Adjacent to Ten Thousand Pound Charge to beat Drums and shoot Muskets for nothing when on the contrary  you shall in the Blessed Revolution we now invite you to have all this done  Gratis  by the Standing Troops kept constantly in Pay and your Lieutenancy may lay down their Commissions among the rest of  NonSignificants  of the Nation  You shall be for ever out of Danger of being ridden again by the  Mob  your Meetinghouses shall no more be the Subject of the enraged Rabbles nor shall the  Bank  of  England  desire the Drums to beat at Midnight to raise a Guard for  Grocer'sHall  your new Monarch will suffer none to Insult or Plunder the City  but himself  and as the City itself shall never want Soldiers  how should it    when the whole Kingdom shall become a Garrison  The Money in the  Bank  shall always be defended by a strong Guard who shall whenever there is any Danger of its being too safe convey it for its Eminent Security from  Grocer  's  Alley  to the  Tower  or to the  Exchequer  where it shall not fail to be kept for the Advantage of the Publick  Again upon this happy Change we shall immediately be delivered from that most Infamous Practice of Stockjobbing of which so much has been said to so little Purpose for the Funds being turned all into One General Stock and the Prince being himself your Security you may even  write upon all your Companies this General Phrase  viz    No Transfer  as they do when the Books are shut up at the  Bank  or  EastIndia  House so as all the Rivers of Water are swallowed up in the Sea as One Ocean to which they are all tending so all these petty Cheats will be Ingulph'd at once in the General Ocean of State Trick and the  ExchangeAlleyMen  may justly be said to Buy the  BearSkin  ever after    Then  which is a Blessing we fear we cannot hope for before we may expect to be deliver'd from the Throng of Virulent and Contumatious Libels which now Infest our Streets and the Libellers themselves being most exemplarily Punished for a Terror to the rest will not dare to affront the Government with Ballads and Balderdash if an impudent Fellow dares lift up his Pen against the Authority and Power of his Prince he shall instantly feel the Weight of that Power to crush him which he ought before to have feared and Pamphleteers shall then not be Whipped and Pillor'd but Hang'd and when Two or Three of them have suffered that Way it is hoped those wholesome Severities may put an effectual stop to the Noise and Clamour they now make in the Nation above all the Hands of the Government will then be set free from the Fetters of Law and it shall  not be always necessary for the Ministers of State to proceed by all the Forms of the Courts of Justice in such Cases by which the Scriblers of the Age pretend to stand it out against the Government and put their own Construction upon their Libels But when these happy Days arrive Juries and Judges shall find and determine in these and all other Cases bring Verdicts and give Sentence as the Prince in his Royal Justice shall direct  We might enter here upon a long List of other happy Circumstances we shall all arrive to and of great Advantages not here named which the Coming in of the Pretender shall infallibly bring us to the Enjoyment of particularly in Matters of Religion Civil Right Property and Commerce but the needful Brevity of this Tract will not admit of it we shall only add one Thing more which gives Weight to all the rest  viz  That the Certainty of these Things and of their being the Natural Consequences of the bringing in the Pretender adds to the certain Felicity of that Reign This Sums up the Happiness of the Pretender's Reign we need not talk of Security as the  Review  has done and pretend he is not able to give us Security for the Performance of any Thing he promises every Man that has any Sense of the Principles Honour  and Justice of the Pretender his Zeal for the  Roman  Catholick Cause his Gratitude to his Benefactor the  French  King and his Love to the Glory and Happiness of his Native Countrey must rest satisfied of his punctually performing all these Great Things for us to ask him Security would be not to Affront him only but to Affront the whole Nation  No Man can doubt him  the Nature of the Thing allows that he must do us all that Kindness he cannot be true to his own Reason without it wherefore this Treaty  executes itself  and appears so rational to believe that whoever doubts it may be supposed to doubt even the Veracity of  James  the Just  What unaccountable Folly then must those People be Guilty of who stand so much in the Way of their own and their Countrey's Happiness as to oppose or pretend to argue against the receiving this Glorious Prince and would be for having  Dutch  Men and Foreigners forsooth to come and all under the Notion of their being  PROTESTANTS  To avoid and detect which Fallacy we shall in our next Essay enter into the Examination of the Religion and Orthodox Principles of the Person of the Pretender and doubt not to make it out for the Satisfaction of all Tender Consciences that he is a true Protestant of the Church of  England  Establish'd by Law and that in very Natural Primitive Sense of that Phrase as it was used by His Royal Predecessor of Famous and Pious Memory  Charles  IIand as such no doubt he will endeavour for the Recovery of the Crown which Crown if he obtains it you see what Glorious Things he may do for himself and us  Quam si Non Tenuit Magnis Tamen Excidit Ausis  FINIS
