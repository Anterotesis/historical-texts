TRadition has in no Instance so clearly evinced her Faith∣fulness as in the transmitting of vulgar Rites and po∣pular Opinions  Of these when we are desirous of tracing them backwards to their Origin many lose themselves in Antiquity  They have indeed travelled down to us through a long Succession of Years and the greatest part of them it is not improbable will be of perpetual Observation for the gene∣rality of Men look back with superstitious Veneration on the Ages of their Forefathers and Authorities that are grey with Time seldom fail of commanding those filial Honours claimed even by the Appearance of hoary old Age  Many of these it must be confessed are mutilated and as in the Remains of antient Statuary the Parts of not a few of them have been awkwardly transposed they preserve however the principal  Traits  that distinguished them in their origin  Things composed of such flimsy Materials as the Fancies of a Multitude do not seem calculated for a long Du  tion yet have these survived Shocks by which even Empires have been overthrown and preserved at least some  Form  and  Co∣lour  of Identity during a Repetition of Changes both in religious Opinions and in the Polity of States  But the strongest Proof of their remote Antiquity is▪ that they have outlived the general Knowledge of the very Causes that gave rise to them  The Reader will find in the subsequent pages an union of Endeavours to rescue many of these Causes from Oblivion If on the Investigation they appear to any so frivolous as not to have deserved the Pains of the Search the humble Labourers will avoid Censure by incurring Contempt  How trivial soever such an Enquiry may seem to some yet all must be informed that it is attended with no small share of Difficulty and Toil  A Passage is to be forced through a Wilderness intricate and entangled few Vestiges of former Labours can be found  to direct us we must oftentimes trace a tedious retrospective Course perhaps to return at last weary and unsatisfied from the making of Researches fruitless as those of some antient enthusiastic Traveller who ranging the barren  African  Sands had in vain attempted to investigate the hidden Sources of the  Nile  Rugged and narrow as this Walk of Study may seem to many yet  Fancy  who shares with  Hope  the pleasing Office of brightening a Passage through every  Route  of human Endeavour opens from hence too Prospects enriched with the choicest Beauties of her magic Creation  The  prime  Origin of the superstitious Notions and Cere∣monies of the People is absolutely unattainable we despair of ever being able to reach the Fountain Head of Streams which have been running and increasing from the Beginning of Time All that we aspire to do is only to trace back∣wards as far as possible the Courses of them on those Charts that remain of the distant Countries from whence they were first perceived to flow  Few who are desirous of investigating the popular No∣tions and vulgar Ceremonies in our Nation can fail of de∣ducing them in their first Direction from the Times when Popery was our established Religion  We shall not wonder that these were able to survive the Reformation when we consider that though our sensible and spirited Forefathers were upon Conviction easily in∣duced to forego religious Tenets which had been weighed in the Balance and sound wanting yet were  the People  by no means inclined to annihilate the seemingly innocent Ceremo∣nies of their former superstitious Faith  These consecrated to the Fancies of Men by a Usage from Time immemorial though crazed by public Authority from the  written Word  were committed as a venerable De∣posit to the keeping of  oral Tradition  like the  Penates  of a∣nother  Troy  recently destroyed they were religiously brought off after having been snatched out of the smoking Ruins of Popery  It is not improbable that in the Infancy of Protestantism the continuance of many of these was connived at by the State For Men  who are but Children of a larger  Growth  are not weaned all at once and the Refor∣mation of Manners and of Religion is always most surely established when effected by slow Degrees and as it were imperceptible Gradations  Thus also at the first Promulgation of Christianity to the Gentile Nations through the Force of Conviction they yielded indeed to Truth yet they could not be persuaded to relin∣quish many of their Superstitions which rather than forego them altogether they chose to blend and incorporate with their new Faith  Christian or rather Papal Rome borrowed her Rites Notions and Ceremonies in the most luxurious Abundance from an∣cient and Heathen Rome and much the greater Number of these flaunting Externals which  Infallibility  has adopted and used as Feathers to adorn  her TripleCap  have been stolen out of the Wings of the  dying Eagle  With regard to the Rites Sports c of the Common People I am aware that the morose and bigoted Part of Mankind  I shall quote here the subsequent  curious Thoughts  on this Subject the Puritans are ridiculed in them  These  teach that  Dancing  is a Jezabell  And  Barleybreak  the ready Way to Hell  The  Morrice Idols Whitsunales  can be  But prophane Reliques of a Jubilee  These in a Zeal t'expresse how much they do  The  Organs  hate have silenc'd  Bagpipes  too  And harmless  Maypoles  all are rail'd upon  As if they were the  Tow'rs  of  Babylon  Randolph's Poems  without distinguishing between the right Use and the Abuse of such Entertainments cavil at and malign them Yet must such be told that Shows and Sports have been countenanced by the best and wisest of States and though it cannot be denied that they have been sometimes prostituted to the Purposes of Riot and Debauchery yet were we to reprobate every thing that has been thus abused  Religion  itself could not be retained perhaps we should be able to keep nothing  The Common People confined by daily Labour seem to require their proper Intervals of Relaxation perhaps it is of  the highest political Utility to encourage innocent Sports and Games among them The Revival of many of these would I think be highly pertinent at this particular Season when the general Spread of Luxury and Dissipation threa∣tens more than at any preceding Period to extinguish the Character of our boasted national Bravery For the Observa∣tion of an honest old Writer Stow who tells us speaking of the Maygames MidsummerEve  I call to mind here the pleasing Account Mr Sterne has left us in his Sentimental Journey of the  Gracedance  after SupperI agree with that amiable Writer in thinking that  Religion  may mix herself in the Dance and that innocent Cheerfulness is no inconsiderable Part of Devotion such indeed as cannot fail of being grateful to the  Good Being  it is a  silent  but  eloquent  Mode of praising him  Rejoicings c an∣tiently used in the Streets of London  which  open  Pastimes in my Youth being now supprest worse Practices  within Doors  are to be seared  may be with singular propriety adopted on the most transient Survey of our present popular Manners  Mr Bourne my Predecessor in this Walk has not from whatever Cause done Justice to the Subject he undertook to treat of Far from having the Vanity to think that I have exhausted it the utmost of my Pretensions is to the Merit of having endeavoured by making Additions to improve it I think him however deserving of no small Share of Praise for his imperfect Attempt for "much is due to those who first broke the Way to Knowledge and left only to their Successors the Task of smoothing it"  New Lights have arisen since his Time The English Antique has become a general and fashionable Study and the Discoveries of the very respectable Society of Antiquaries have rendered the Recesses of Papal and Heathen Antiquities easier of access  I flatter myself I have turned all these Circumstances in some measure to Advantage I have gleaned Passages that seemed to throw Light upon the Subject from a great Va∣riety of Volumes and those written too in several Lan∣guages in the doing of which if I shall not be found to having deserved the Praise of Judgment I must at least make Pretensions to the Merit of Industry  Elegance of Composition will hardly be expected in a Work of this Kind which stands much less in need of Attic Wit than of Roman Perseverance and  Dutch  Assiduity  I shall offer some Discoveries which are peculiarly my own for there are Customs yet retained here in the North of which I am persuaded the learned of the Southern Part of the Island have not heard which is perhaps the sole Cause why they have never before been investigated  In perusing the subsequent Observations the candid Rea∣der who has never before considered this neglected Subject is requested not to be rash in passing Sentence but to suspend his Judgment at least till he has carefully examined all the Evidence by which Caution I do not wish to have it understood that our Determinations are thought to be in∣fallible or that every Decision here is not amenable to an higher Authority In the mean time Prejudice may be for∣warned and it will apologize for many seemingly trivial Reasons assigned for the beginning and transmitting of this or that  Notion  or  Ceremony  to reflect that what may appear foolish to the enlightened Understandings of Men in the  Eighteenth  Century wore a very different Aspect when viewed through the Gloom that prevailed in the  seventh  or  eighth  I should trespass upon the Patience of my Reader were I to enumerate all the Books I have consulted on this Oc∣casion to which however I shall take Care in their proper Places to refer but I own myself under particu∣lar Obligations to  Durand  's Ritual of Divine Offices a Work inimical to every Idea of rational Worship but to the Enquirer into the Origin of our popular Ceremonies an in∣valuable Magazine of the most interesting Intelligence I would stile this Performance the great  Ceremonial Law  of the Romanists in Comparison with which the  Mosaic Code  is  bar∣ren  of Rites and Ceremonies We stand amazed on perusing it at the enormous Weight of a new Yoke which  Holy Church  fabricating  with her own Hands  has imposed on her servile Devotees  Yet the Forgers of these Shackles had artfully contrived to make them sit easy by twisting Flowers around them Dark as this Picture drawn by the Pencil of gloomy Super∣stition  appeared upon  the whole  yet was its deep  Shade  contrasted with pleasing  Lights  The Calendar was crowded with RedLetter Days nomi∣nally indeed consecrated to  Saints  but which by the en∣couragement of Idleness ond Dissipation of Manners gave every kind of countenance to SINNERS  A Profusion of childish Rites Pageants and Ceremonies diverted the Attention of the People from the consideration of their real State and kept them in humour if it did not sometimes make them in love with their slavish Modes of Worship  To the Credit of our sensible and manly Forefathers they were among the first who felt the Weight of this new and unnecessary Yoke and had Spirit enough to throw it off  I have fortunately in my Possession one of those antient Romish Calendars of singular Curiosity which contains un∣der the immoveable Feasts and Fasts I regret much its Silence on the moveable ones a variety of brief Observations contributing not a little to the elucidation of many of our popular Customs and proving them to have been sent over from Rome with  Bulls Indulgencies  and other Baubles bartered as it should seem for our  Peterpence  by those who trafficked in spiritual Merchandize from the Continent  These I shall carefully translate though in some Places it is extremely difficult to render the very barbarous  Latin  of which I fear the Critic will think I have transfused the Bar∣barity Brevity and Obscurity into my own  English  and lay before my Reader who will at once see and acknowledge their Utility  A learned Performance by a Doctor Moresin in the Time of James I and dedicated to that Monarch is also luckily in my Possession It is written in Latin and entitled "The Origin and Increase of Depravity in Religion" containing a very masterly Parallel between the Rites Notions c of  Heathen  and those of  Papal  Rome  The copious Extracts from this Work with which I shall adorn the subsequent Pages will be their own Eulogy and supersede my poor Encomiums  When I call to remembrance the  Poet of  The late Mr Grey  Humanity  who has transmitted his Name to Immortality by Reflections writ∣ten among the little Tombstones of the Vulgar in a Country ChurchYard I am urged by no false Shame to apologize for the seeming Unimportance of my Subject  The Antiquities of the Common People cannot be studied without acquiring some useful Knowledge of Mankind By the chemical Process of Philosophy even Wisdom may be extracted from the Follies and Superstitions of our Forefathers  The  People  of whom Society is chiefly composed and for whose good Superiority of Rank is only a Grant made ori∣ginally by mutual Concession is a respectable Subject to every one who is the Friend of Man  Pride which independent of the Idea arising from the Necessity of civil Polity has portioned out the human  Genus  into such a variety of different and subordinate  Species  must be compelled to own that the lowest of these derives itself from an Origin common to it with the highest of the Kind The beautiful Sentiment of  Terence  "  Homo  sum  humani  nihil á me alienum puto"  may be adopted therefore in this Place to persuade us that nothing can be foreign to our Enquiry which concerns the smallest of the Vulgar of those  little ones  who occupy the lowest Place in the political Arrangement of human Beings  J B  WestgateStreet Newcastle  Nov    N B Here follow Mr Bourne's Title Page Dedi∣cation and Preface  Antiquitates Vulgares  OR THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE Common People GIVING An Account of

following Sheets are a few of that vast Number of  Ceremonies  and  Opinions  which are held by the Common People such as they solely or generally observe For tho' some of them have been of National and others perhaps of universal Observance yet at present they would have little or no Being if not ob∣served among the Vulgar  I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burdening of the People nor an Abolisher of innocent Customs which are their Pleasures and Recreations I aim at nothing but a Regulation of those which are in Being amongst them which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome and aboli∣shing such only as are sinful and wicked  Some of the Customs they hold have been originally good tho' at present they retain little of their primitive Purity the true Meaning and Design of them being either lost or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superstition To wipe off therefore the Dust they have contracted to clear them of Superstition and make known their End and Design may turn to some Account and be of Advantage whereas observing them in the  present Way is not only of no Advantage but of very great Detriment  Others they hold are really sinful notwithstanding in outward Appearance they seem very harmless being a Scandal to Religion and an encouraging of Wicked∣ness And therefore to aim at abolishing these will I hope be no Crime tho' they be the Diversions of the People  As to the Opinions they hold they are almost all su∣perstitious being generally either the Produce of Hea∣thenism or the Inventions of indolent  Monks  who having nothing else to do were the Forgers of many silly and wicked Opinions to keep the World in Awe and Ignorance And indeed the ignorant Part of the World is so still aw'd that they follow the idle Tradi∣tions of the one more than the Word of GOD and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence more Dread of their un∣lucky ones than his Wrath and Punishment  The regulating therefore of these Opinions and Cus∣toms is what I propos'd by the following Compositions whatever has been suggested to the contrary And as to the Menaces of some and the Censures of others I neither fear nor regard them I shall be always ready to own any Mistake and in what I justly may to vindicate myself  The CONTENTS OF THE ANTIQUITATES VULGARES  CHAP I  OF the SoulBell its

its first Institution  THE Ceremony of tolling the Bell at the Time of Death seems to be as ancient as the having of Bells them∣selves we are told  Bingham  's Orig Eccl Lib  it was about the seventh Century when Bells were first in the Church and that venerable  Bede  is the first that men∣tions them If this be true then it is as true that the tolling of the Bell was instituted about that Time for where our Countryman  mentions the Word  Campana  or Bell there it also is that we find a Bell made use of for the Dead  Haec tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum quo ad orationes ex∣citari vel convocari solebant cum quis eorum de seculo fuisset evocatus  Bed Eccl Hist Lib    Cap    For at the Death of the Abbess St  Hilda  he tells us that one of the Sisters of a distant Monastery as she was sleeping thought she heard the wellknown Sound of that Bell which called them to Prayers when any of them had departed this Life But be that as it will it is evident that the Bell was tolled upon this Occasion about  Bede  's Time and consequently that the Ceremony is as an∣cient as his Days  The Reason why this custom was instituted was not as some seem to imagine for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood that such a Person was dead but chiefly that whoever heard the Noise of the Bell should put up their Prayers for the Soul Thus the Father abovementioned tells us again  Quod cum illa audisset suscitavit cunctas sorores in ecclesiam convocatas orationibus psalmis pro anima matris operam dare monuit  Ibid  That she who presided in this Monastery had no sooner heard this than she raised all the Sis∣ters and called them into the Church where she exhorted them to pray fervently and sing a  Requiem  for the Soul of their Mother  Cas∣salion  also upon this Place of  Bede  says  That  Et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in  Anglia  ut cum quis decessit statim campana propriae illius Parochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatium Quamvis  Angli  negent modo orationes suffragia defunctis proficua non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui per∣cipere quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae  An∣glicanae Cassali  de vet Sac Christ Rit P  the same Custom is still observed in  England  that as soon as any hath departed this Life the Bell belonging to the Parish he liv'd in was imme∣diately tolled and for some TimeAnd though  says he  the  English  now deny that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony than that it was a Custom of the old Church of  Eng∣land  And for this Reason it is that this Custom was first observed and should be still retained among us  viz  That the Prayers of the Faith∣ful may be assisting to the Soul and certainly it might be more profitably retained were it so ordered that the Bell should be tolled be∣fore the Person's Departure as was undoubtedly designed when this Ceremony was continued that good men might give him their Prayers Was this always so observed there might be some  Moses  amongst the Number of the Faith∣ful whose Prayers could prevail upon God to beat back  the Amalekites of Darkness  some whose  Faith  might remove a  Mountain of Sins  and some whose Tears procure a Multitude of Mercies O the Comfort of  the Forgiveness of Sins  Of  being guided safely through the Sha∣dow of Death  Of arriving securely at the heavenly Country What is it that Prayer can't obtain  But though the Wickedness and Impeni∣tency of the dying Person be such as that the Prayers of the Faithful will not be suffi∣cient to avert the Wrath and Punishment of a justly incensed God yet as this can be only known to God it will not discharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy in the most passionate and affectionate Manner They thereby express the most laudable Zeal the most disinterested Charity and whilst they are so solicitous for the Happiness and Welfare of other Men's Souls they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greatest Con∣cern for their own and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emula∣tion  from Strength to Strength  and endeavour as the  Heb vi  Apostle advises  to go on to Perfection  But alas we are fallen into Times of such Irreligion and Prejudice such Contempt of An∣tiquity and such too great Reformation that what with Indolence on one Hand and Igno∣rance on the other what with no Zeal on this  Side and too  Among the many Objections of the  Brownists  it is laid to the Charge of the Church of  England  that though we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory and teach the contrary yet how well our Practice suits with it may be considered in our ringing of hal∣lowed Bells for the Soul Bish  Hall  cont  Brown  false a one on that we either neglect the most decent Ceremonies of Reli∣gion or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremonies at all No Wonder then that  in the Midst of such a crooked and perverse Genera∣tion  when the most of Men are negligent of themselves they are also negligent of others No Wonder that when there is such a ge∣neral Contempt of Religion and Men are care∣less of their own Souls they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends  But it is called  In a VestryBook belonging to the Chapel of  AllSaints  in  Newcastle upon Tyne  it is observable That the Tolling of the Bell is not mentioned in the Parish Accounts from the Year    till    when we find it ordered to be tolled again At a Vestry holden  January st Whereas for some Years past the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling hath been forborn and laid aside which hath much lessened the Revenue of the Church by which and suchlike Means it is brought into Dilapidations and having now taken the same into serious Consideration and fully debated the Ob∣jections made by some against the same and having had the Judgment of our Ministers concerning any Superstition that might be in it which being made clear it is this Day or∣dered That from henceforth the Church Officer appointed thereunto do collect the same and bring the Money unto the ChurchWardens and that those who desire to have the Use of the Bells may freely have them as formerly paying the accustomed Fees  It is certain they laid it aside because they thought it superstitious and it is probable if they had not wanted Money they had not seen the contrary  Popish and Superstitious for what true Reason I know not Did we  indeed imagine with the Papists that there is any  We call them SoulBells for that they signifie the Depar∣ture of the Soul not for that they help the Passage of the Soul Bish  Hall  cont  Brown  P    Virtue or extraordinary Power in a Bell that it is  Item ut Daemones tinnitu campanarum Christianos ad preces concitantium terreantur Formula vero baptizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est  Durant Lib C    S    hallowed by Baptism and drives away the Spirits of Darkness then it might justly be called Superstition and therefore just∣ly abolished But when we retain the Custom only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul it would surely be of Advan∣tage to observe it if the  Prayers of a righteous Man avail  any Thing at all which if we may believe an inspired Apostle are of very great Efficacy and Validity  Art thou then attending a Friend in his last Moments Art thou careful for his Soul and solicitous for his Salvation Dost thou wish him safe  through the Valley of Death to the ever∣lasting Hills  Wouldst thou have the good An∣gels protect him and be his  Shield against the Powers of Darkness  In short wouldst thou have him crown'd with the Joys of  Paradise  Be assured then that the Prayers of good men  will very much contribute to the gaining of these Things But how shall they then pray for him if they know not of his Departure And how can they know that without the tolling of the Bell Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Custom not as our Age generally does after the Death of thy Friend but before it before he leave the World when the Prayers of good Men can assist him and facilitate his Journey into the other Life  Or art thou  working in the Field or grind∣ing at the Mill  Remember then when thou hearest the Sound of the Bell for one depart∣ing that thou put up thy Prayers for him Be thy Business what it will it will always permit thee to say at least  LORD now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace  Or to use the Words of St  Oswald  when he and his Sol∣diers were ready to be slain  Lord have Mercy on the Soul of thy  Oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui Unde dicunt in proverbio Deus miserere animabus dixit  Oswaldus  cadens in terram  Bed Eccl L    C    It is used  says  Bede    even to a Proverb  That he died praying  for when the Enemy had surrounded him and he saw himself about to be slain he prayed unto the LORD for the Souls of his Army Hence it is that the Proverb comes  LORD have Mercy upon the Soul as St  Oswald  said when he fell to the Earth  Which Proverb in all Probability hath been the Original of this pre∣sent national Saying  When the Bell begins to toll  LORD have Mercy on the Soul  Servant  It will not be  long till thou thyself shalt have Occasion for such Prayers till thou come to die and enter on thy Journey to the other State If then  thou hast been merciful thou shalt obtain Mercy  if by thy Prayers thou hast assisted the Souls of thy Brethren thou shalt either be remem∣bered in the Prayers of good Men or surely these thy Prayers for others will be of Service to thyself also at that dreadful hour  But now it may be objected That as the Bell is seldom tolled till after the Person's De∣parture it is to no Purpose to pray for the Soul nay to pray for it would be praying for the Dead And since that is repugnant to the Doctrine of our Church our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted  Indeed it is too true this Custom is not so common as it should be but however it is so much observed as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant Prayers I know several religious Families in this Place and I hope it is so in other Places too who always observe it whenever the melancholy Season offers and therefore it will at least sometimes happen when we put up our Prayers constantly at the tolling of the Bell that we shall pray for a Soul departing And tho' it be granted that it will oftener happen otherwise as the regular Custom is so little followed yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead We  believe that the Soul is but departing and it is charitably done to offer up our Prayers And therefore when it proves otherwise  our  Psalm xxxiv  Prayer shall turn into our own Bosom  and like as that Peace which the Disciples wished to an unworthy House returned to the Disciples again so though our Prayers at that Time may be of no Service to the Soul yet they will be of no Disservice to us They will re∣turn to us again but it will be no Fault to have misplaced them  PRAYERS upon this OCCASION from Bishop  TAYLOR  I  O Holy and most Gracious JESU we humbly recommend the Soul of thy Servant into thy Hands thy most merciful Hands Let thy blessed Angels stand in Ministry about thy Servant and defend him from the Violence and Malice of all his ghostly Enemies And drive far from him all the Spirits of Darkness

Opinion that the Ce∣remony of tolling a Bell  The subsequent Etymology of this Word has the Sanction of the learned Sir Henry Spelman  Bell  is derived from  Pelvis  a Bason for before the Invention of Bells not only  sounding Brass  but  Basons  also were used instead of them Housewives to this Day try the Soundness of their Earthen or China Vases by  ringing  them with a Finger Vide Lye's Junii Etymolog in verbo Mr Wheatley in his Illustration of the Liturgy apologizes for our retaining this Ceremony  Our Church says he in Imita∣tion of the Saints in former Ages calls in the Minister and others who are at hand to assist their Brother in his last Ex∣tremity In order to this she directs that when any one is  passing  out of this Life a Bell should be tolled c  It is called from thence the  Passing Bell  at the Time of Death is as antient as the Use of Bells This is somewhat improbable It has rather been an AfterInvention of Superstition Thus praying for the  Dying  was  improved upon  into praying for the  Dead  Bells must have been first used as Signals to con∣vene the People to their public Devotions  Mr Bourne has overlooked a Passage in Du∣rand's Ritual that would have been much to his Purpose  Verùum aliquo moriente Campanae debent pulsari ut Po∣pulus hoc audiens oret pro illo Pro  muliere  quidem  bis  pro eo quòd ipsa invenit Asperitatem Primo enim fecit hominem alienum à Deo quare  secunda  dies non habuit Benedictionem Pro  Viro  verò  ter  pulsatur quia primò inventa est in Homine Trinitas Primò enim formatus est Adam de terra deinde mu∣lier ex Adam postea Homo creatus est ab Utroque et ita est ibi Trinitas Si autem  Clericus sit tot vicibus  compulsatur quot  ordines  habuit ipse Ad ultimum verò compulsari debet cum  omnibus  Campanis ut ita sciat populus pro quo sit oran∣dum Debet etiam compulsari quando ducimus ad Ecclesiam et quando de Ecclesia ad Tumulum deportatur  Vide Durandi Rationale p  Durand flourished about the End of the th Century  In Ray's Collection of old English Proverbs I find the following Couplet  When thou dost hear a Toll or Knell  Then think upon  thy  passing Bell    When any one is dying says that  Ritualist Bells must be tolled that the People may put up their PrayersLet this be done  twice  for a  Woman  and  thrice  for a  Man  The superstitious Reasons he assigns for these Numbers are too contemptible for Translation  If for a Clergyman  as many Times  as he had  Orders  and at the Conclusion a Peal on  all  the Bells to distinguish the Quality of the Person for whom the People are to put up their Prayers A Bell too must be rung while we are conduct∣ing the Corpse to Church and during the bring∣ing it out of the Church to the Grave  I think this a curious and pertinent Quotation It seems to account for a Custom still preserved in the North of making numeral Distinctions at the Conclusion of this Ceremony  nine  Knells for a Man  six  for a Woman and  three  for a Child which are without Doubt the Vestiges of this antient Injunction of Popery  The Quotation our Author gives us from Bede  I have examined this Passage in King Alfred's Saxon Version of Bede In rendering  Campana  I find he has used Cluggan which properly signifies a  Clock Bellan  is in the Margin  Clock  is the old German Name for a Bell and hence the French call one  une Clóche  There were no Clocks in England in Alfred's Time He is said to have measured his Time by Wax Candles marked with circular Lines to distinguish the HoursI would infer from this that our Clocks have certainly been so called from the  Bells  in themMr Strutt confesses he has not been able to trace the Date of the Invention of Clocks in EnglandStow tells us they were commanded to be set up in Churches in the Year A gross Mistake and into which our honest Historian must have been led by his misunderstanding the Word  Cloca  a Latin Term coined from the old German Name for a  Bell  For  Clocks  therefore read  Bells  is very apposite as is that from Cassalion's occa∣sional  Comment The latter however appears to no great Advantage as an Antiquary when he tells us  he could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony than that it was a Custom of the old Church of England  The Passage above cited from Durand would have informed him from whence it must have been imported into this King∣dom  It may gratify the Curiosity of some to peruse the following general Observations on Bells  Spelman in his very learned Glossary verb  Campana  has preserved two Monkish Lines in which all the antient Offices of Bells seem to be included  Laudo Deum verum Plebem voco congrego Clerum  Defunctos ploro pestem fugo Festa decoro  We praise the true God call the People convene the Clergy Lament the Dead dispel Pestilence and grace Festivals  I have not been able to ascertain precisely the Date of this useful Invention The Antients had some Sort of Bells I find the Word  Tintinnabula  which we usually render  Bells  in Martial Juvenal and Suetonius The Romans were summoned by these of whatever Size or Form they were to their hot Baths and to the Business of public Places  The large Kind of Bells now in Use are said to have been invented by Paulinus Bishop of Nola in Campania whence the Latin Name  Campana    about the Year  Spelman's Gloss verb Campana Truster's Chronology  and to have been generally used in Churches about the th Year of the Christian Aera Mr Bingham  Antiquities of Christ Church Vol I p  however thinks this a vulgar Error In short we are left much in the Dark concerning the Antiquities of the ear∣lier Ages of the ChurchEcclesiastical Writers frequently clash in their Accounts  Josephus  The Jews used Trumpets for Bells The Turks permit not the Use of Bells The Greek Church under them still follow their old Custom of using wooden Boards or Iron Plates full of holes which they hold in their Hands and knock with a Hammer or Mallet to call the People together to Church  See Dr Smith's Account of the Greek Church He was an EyeWitness of this remarkable Custom which Durand tells us is retained in the Romish Church on the three last Days of the Week preceding Easter Durandi Rational p  Bingham informs us of an Invention before Bells for con∣vening religious Assemblies in Monasteries It was going by Turns to every one's Cell and with the Knock of a Hammer calling the Monks to Church The Instrument was called the NightSignal and the wakening MalletIn many of the Colleges at Oxford the Bible Clerk knocks at every Room Door with a Key to waken the Students in the Morning before he begins to ring the Chapel BellA Vestige it should seem of the antient monastic Custom  China has been remarkably famous for its Bells Father le Compte tells us that at Pekin there are seven Bells each of which weighs one hundred and twenty thousand Pounds  Baronius  Cum vero post haec Johannes Papa in urbem rediisset con∣tigit primariam Lateranensis Ecclesiae Campanam mirae magnitu∣dinis recens

consecrated a very large newcast Bell  in the Lateran Church and gave it the Name of  John  This is the first Instance I meet with of what has been since called "the baptizing of Bells" a Superstition which the Reader may find ridiculed in the Romish  Romish Beehive p  BeehiveThe Vestiges of this Cus∣tom may be yet traced in England in  Tom  of Lin∣coln and great  Tom  "the mighty Tom" at Christ

Durand tells us  In  festis quae ad gratiam  pertinent Cam∣panae tumultuosius tinniunt et prolixius concrepant  Rational p  The ringing of Bells on the Arrival of Emperors Bishops Abbots c at Places

of Opinion that Devils are much afraid of Bells and fly away at the Sound of them That Ritualist would have thought it a Prostitution of the sacred Utensils had he heard them rung as they are  here  with the greatest Impropriety on winning a long Main at Cockfighting He would perhaps have talked in another Strain and have represented these aerial Enemies as lending their Assistance to ring them  There is a curious Passage in Fuller's History of Waltham Abbey A D the th of Henry VIII relative to the Wages of Bellringers It is preserved from the Churchwardens Account "Item paid for ringing at the Prince his coming  a Penny  "    In the populous commercial Town from whence I date these observations Church Bells have not been confined to  ecclesiastical  Uses they have also with great Propriety been adapted to  civil  Purpo∣sesThe tolling of the great Bell of St Nicholas' Church here is an antient Signal for our Burgesses to convene on GuildDays and on the Day of electing MagistratesOur little  Carnival  Vide PancakeTuesday in the Appendix  on Pan∣cake Tuesday commences by the same Signal A Bell usually called the  Thief  and  Reever  a Robber To  reeve  to spoil or rob  Speght's Glossary to Chaucer  Reever Bell  proclaims our two annual FairsA peculiar Kind of Alarm is given by a Bell on Accidents of Fire  A Bell is rung at six every Morning except Sundays and Holidays with a view it should seem of calling up the Artisans to their daily Em∣ployment and we retain also a Vestige of the old Norman Curfew  William the Conqueror in the first Year of his Reign com∣manded that in every Town and Village a Bell should be rung every Night at eight o'clock and that all people should then put out their Fire and Candle and go to Bed The ringing of this Bell was called in French Curfew  i e  CoverFire  Ibid  at eight in the evening Our Bells are  muffled  on the th of January for which I find no precedent of Antiquity their sound on that occasion is peculiarly plaintive  Distinction of Rank is preserved here in the tol∣ling of the SoulBell an high Fee excludes the common People and appropriates to the Death of Persons of Consequence the tolling the great Bell of each Church on this OccasionWith us too as Durand orders above a Bell is tolled and sometimes Chimes are rung a little before the Burial and while they are conducting the Corps to Church They chime or ring too in some places while the grave is filling up  There seems to be nothing intended by tolling the  passing  Bell at present but to inform the Neighbourhood of any Person's Death and I am much mistaken if our Author's  Mr Bourne complains in his Preface of the  invidious  Be∣haviour of some of his TownsmenIt is beneath a Man  con∣scious of inward Worth  to  complain  of that which he ought always  to despise  Posterity seems to have done him very am∣ple Justice for their InsultsA Copy of the  Antiquitates Vul∣gares  has of late fetched seven or eight Shillings in London Many perhaps will think the Purchasers mistook an Accident for Merit and confounded the Idea of  Scarceness  with that of  intrinsic Value  I received this Information from one of the So∣ciety of Antiquaries who understands the Subject too well himself to be mistaken in his Opinion of the Merit of those who have writ∣ten upon it On the Weight of that Opinion alone I have been in∣duced to preserve every Line that our Author has left us in that Work  very pious Ex∣hortation  will ever be able to revive the primitive Use of it  I know not how the present Generation will re∣lish his Reflections in this and many subsequent Chapters Serious Animadversions of this Sort seem by no Means pleasing to the  refined  Taste of  our  Age We plainly discover an Intention of uni∣ting Entertainment with Utility in his  little Ser∣mons  which it must be confessed are not always  delivered  in the most  agreeable Manner  He does not always  stick by his Text  His  Inferences  are

con∣tent themselves with the homely Manner in which he has  served  it  up  to themIndeed  Squeamish∣ness  in this Particular would but ill suit the Study of the  English Antique  A great deal of wholsome  Meat  of this Sort has  been brought on  upon  wooden  Platters Nice  Guests  will think our famous old  Cook  Mr Hearne himself but a very coarse and greasy Kind of  Host  In fine I have not presumed to violate my Au∣thor's Text lest I should seem to play the Empiric and lay the  Foundation  of my own little Structure upon the  Ruins  of his  CHAP II  Of Watching with the Dead  WATCHING with the Corps was an an∣tient Custom of the Church and every where practised They were wont to sit by it from the Time of its Death till its Expor∣tation to the Grave either in the House it died in or in the Church itself Agreeable to this we read in St  Austin  That as they watched his Mother  Monica  Psalterium arripuit  Fuodius  cantare caepit psalmum cui respondebamus omnes domus Miserecordiam judicium cantabo tibi Domine  Aug Lib    Confes C    Euodius  took the  Psalter  and began to sing a  Psalm  which the whole Family answered with that of the Psalmist  David I will sing of Mercy and Judg∣ment unto thee O LORD will I sing  And we are told  Ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est corpus ipsius portatum est ibique eadem fuit nocte quam vigilavi∣mus in pascha  Greg Turon de Gloria Confes C    That at the Death of St  Am∣brose  his Body was carried into the Church before Day the same Hour he died It was the Night before  Easter  and they watched with him there  How unlike to this antient Custom of watch∣ing is the modern one of locking up the Corps  in a Room and leaving it there alone How unlike to this decent Manner of watching is that watching of the Vulgar which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdness Watch∣ing at that Time with a dear Friend is the last Kindness and Respect we can shew him and how unfriendly is it to change it into Negligence and too great Resignation How unchristian instead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity to put on an unbecoming Joy and undecent Pastime  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER II  OUR Author for what Reason I know not has omitted the vulgar Name given here to this  watching with a Corps  It is called the  Lake∣wake  a Word plainly derived from the AngloSaxon Lic or Lice  a Corpse  and Waecce  a Wake Vigil  or  Watching  It is used in this Sense by Chaucer in his Knight's Tale  Shall not be told for me  How that Arcite is brent to Ashen cold  Ne how that there the  Lichewake  was yhold  All that Night long  Thus also I read in the Article  Walkin  in the learned  By the late Mr Ruddiman as is generally supposed  Glossary to Douglas' Virgil  Properly  Likewakes  Scotch are the Meetings of the Friends of the Deceased a Night or Nights be∣fore the Burial  I am not satisfied with either of the Quotations he has given us in Proof of the Antiquity of the Custom They are indeed something to the Pur∣pose but in the last cited Passage one would be inclined to think from the Words of the Original that the  Watching  was on Account of its being the Vigil of EasterDay  The subsequent Extract from one of the antient Councils quoted in Durant  Porro observandum est nedum Psalmos cani consuetum cum funus ducitur sed etiam  nocte quoe praecedit funus veteres vigi∣lasse  nocturnasque vigilias canendis Psalmis egisse  p is I think much more apposite  Now it must be observed that Psalms are wont to be sung not only when the Corps is conducted to Church but that the Antients  watched on the Night  before the Burial and spent the Vigil in singing Psalms  So also  Gregory  in the Epistle that treats of the Death of his Sister Macrina has these Words  Cùm igitur inquit  nocturna pervigilatio  ut in Martyrum ce∣lebritate canendis Psalmis perfecta esset Crepusculum adve∣nisset c Durant p  "Now when the  nightly Watching  as is usual" c  I could give numerous Passages from the An∣tients were there any Doubt of the Antiquity of a Custom which probably owes its Origin to the tenderest  Affections  of human Nature and has per∣haps on that Account been used from the Infancy of Time  I find in Durant a pretty exact Account of some of the Ceremonies used at present in what we call  laying out  or  streeking  To streek  to expand or stretch out from the AngloSaxon strecan extendere See Benson's AngloSaxon Vocabulary in verboA  StreekingBoard  is that on which they stretch out and compose the Limbs of the dead Body  in the North  Quinetiam Sanctorum Corpora manibus erectis supinisque excipere  occludere  oculosora  obturare  decenter  ornare lavare  accuratè  linteo funebri  involvere c  Durant de Ritibus p  Mr Pennant in his Tour in Scotland tells us that on the Death of a Highlander the Corps being  stretched  on a  Board  and covered with a coarse  Linen Wrapper  the Friends lay on the Breast of the Deceased a  wooden Platter  containing a small Quantity of  Salt  and  Earth  separate and unmixed the  Earth  an Emblem of the corruptible Body the  Salt  an Emblem of the immortal Spirit All Fire is extinguished where a Corps is kept and it is rec∣koned so ominous for a Dog or a Cat to pass over it that the poor Animal is killed without Mercy  Mention is made of the closing the Eyes and Lips the decent washingdressingand wrapping in a Linen Shroud  The  Face Cloth  too is of great AntiquityMr Strutt tells us that after the closing the Eyes c a Linen Cloth was put over the Face of the DeceasedThus we are told that Henry the Fourth in his last Illness seeming to be dead his Chamberlain covered his Face with a  Linen Cloth  English Aera p  Of which Shroud Pruden∣tius the Christian Poet has these Words  Candore nitentia claro  Praetendere lintea mos est  Hymn ad Exequias Defunct  The Interests of our Woollen Manufactories have interfered with this antient Rite in England  It is customary at this Day in Northumberland to set a Pewter  Plate  containing a little  Salt  Salem abhorrere constat Diabolum et ratione optima nititur quia  Sal  aeternitatis est et immortalitatis signum neque putredine neque corruptione infestatur unquam sed ipse ab his omnia vendicat  Deprav Rel c p  Considered in reference to this symbolical Explication how beau∣tiful is that Expression "Ye are the Salt of the Earth"  upon  the Corps as also a  Candle  in some PlacesThe learned Moresin tells us  That  Salt  is the Emblem of Eternity and Immortality It is not liable to Putrefaction itself and it preserves Things that are seasoned with it from Decay  He gives us also his Conjecture on the Use of a  Candle  Lucerna  seu  Candela  mortuis cadaveribus semper apponitur in domibus et templis quamdiu supra terram suntan hinc ducto more oculo

old Friends cMoresin tells us that in England they were so profuse on this Occasion that it cost less to  portion off a Daughter  than to  bury a dead  Wife  These Burial Feasts are still retained in the North  We have the very  Coffin  of the present Age de∣scribed in Durant  Corpus lotum et sindone obvolutum ac  loculo  conditum ve∣teres in Caenaculis seu Tricliniis exponebant p  Loculus is a Box or ChestThus I find Coffins called  Kists  i e Chests in our old Registers    It appears that among the primitive Christians the Corps was sometimes kept four Days  It was customary in the Christian Burials of the AngloSaxons to leave the Head and Shoulders of the Corps uncovered till the Time of Burial that Relations c might take a last View of their deceased Friend To this day we yet retain in our Way this old Custom leaving the Coffin of the Deceased unscrewed till the Time of Burial Strutt Vol I p Manners c  Pe∣lagia  Postulabat a Filio ne cam ante diem quartum sepeliret  in Gregory of Turon requests of her Son that her Corps may not be interred till after  four Days  The Payment of  Mortuaries  is of great Anti∣quity It was antiently done by leading or driving a Horse or Cow c before the Corps of the De∣ceased at his Funeral It was considered as a Gift left by a Man at his Death by Way of Recom∣pence for all Failures in the Payment of Tithes and Oblations and called a  Corsepresent  It is mentioned in the national Council of Engsham about the Year Some Antiquaries have been led into a Mistake by this leading a Horse before the Corps and have erroneously represented it as peculiar to Military Characters  Collier's Ecclesiast Hist Vol I p    The Abuse of this  Vigil  or  Lakewake  is of pretty old standingI find the following Account  of a Canon made at the provincial Synod held in London in the Time of Edward III in Collier's Ecclesiastical History Vol I p  The th Canon endeavours to prevent the Disorders com∣mitted at People's  watching a Corps  before Bu∣rial Here the Synod takes Notice that the De∣sign of People's meeting together upon such Oc∣casions was to join their Prayers for the Benefit of the dead Person that this antient and ser∣viceable Usage was overgrown with Supersti∣tion and turned into a Convenience for  Theft  and  Debauchery  Therefore for a Remedy against this Disorder 'tis decreed that upon the Death of any Person none should be allowed to  watch  before the Corps in a private House excepting near Relations and Friends of the Deceased and such as offered to repeat a set Number of Psalms for the Benefit of his Soul  The Penalty an∣nexed is ExcommunicationThis is also men∣tioned in Becon's  Fol  Reliques of Rome and com∣prised in the Catalogue of those Crimes that were antiently cursed with  Bell Book  and  Candle  Mr Bourne complains of the Sport Drinking and Lewdness used at these  Lakewakes  Mr Pennant in describing Highland Ceremonies calls this Meeting the  Latewake  I suspect he has put a  t  for a  k  Thus in describing  Coken  a romantic Seat near Chesterlestreet he spells it erroneously  Coker  His Words are  The  Latewake  is a Ceremony used at Funerals The Evening after the Death of any Person the Relations or Friends of the Deceased meet at the House attended by Bagpipe or Fiddle the nearest of Kin be it Wife Son or Daughter opens a melancholy Ball dancing and  greeting i e  crying violently at the same Time and this continues till Daylight but with such Gambols and Frolicks among the younger Part of the Company that the Loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the Consequences of that NightIf the Corps remains unburied for two Nights the same Rites are renewed Thus Scythianlike they rejoice at the Deliverance of their Friends out of this Life of Misery  He tells us in the same Place  that the  Coranich  or singing at Funerals is still in Use in some Places The Songs are generally in Praise of the Deceased or a Recital of the va∣liant Deeds of him or Ancestors  Perhaps Mr Pennant in spelling  Latewake  wished to have the Name derived from  watching late  None can suppose this but those who are totally ignorant of our antient Language which is preserved in all its  pristine Purity  in the vulgar Dialect of the North  in his  TimeThey still continue to resemble too much the antient Bacchanalian OrgiesAn Instance of Depravity that highly disgraces human Nature It would be treating the serious Subject with two much levity to say that if the inconsiderate Wretches who abuse such solemn Meetings think at all they think with Epicurean licentiousness that since Life is so uncertain no Opportunity should be neglected of transmitting it and that the Loss by the  Death  of one Relation should be made up as soon as possible by the  Birth  of ano∣ther  Our Author uses a remarkable Metaphor in this Passage he talks or rather babbles concerning "putting on undecent Pastime"If one were disposed to banter it might be observed that a  Wardrobe  of "undecent Pastime" must consist of very  light Habits  It may be questioned also whe∣ther in any Affliction we can discover  too great Resignation  CHAP III  Of following the Corps to the Grave what it is an Emblem of Of carrying Greens in our Hand what it signifies what Use it may be of Of Psalmody its Antiquity the Advan∣tage and Use of it  IT hath been observed among all Nations both in the Heathen and the Christian World as a becoming and profitable Cere∣mony to follow the Corps to the Grave The Heathens observed it  Praecedenti pompa funebri vivi sequuntur tanquam handmulto post morituri  Al ab Alex Lib    p  Et  Pol Vir Lib    C    p    because it presented to them what would shortly follow how they themselves should be so carried out and laid down in the Grave The going of the Corps before shewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death and their following after was as much as to say that they must also in a short Time follow him thither For this Reason the Christian also observes the Custom and may if he plea∣ses as he follows the Body to the Grave en∣tertain himself with a pious Meditation upon it in such like Thoughts as these of the Psal∣mist  Psal xc  Thou art GOD from Everlasting and World without End Thou turnest Man to De∣struction again Thou sayest Come again ye Chil∣dren of Men For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday seeing that is past as a Watch in the Night As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a Sleep and fade away suddenly like the Grass In the Morning it is green and groweth up but in the Evening it is cut down dried up and withered Do thou therefore O LORD  Psal xxxix  let me know my End and the Number of my Days that I may be certified how long I have to live Behold thou hast made my Days as it were a Span long and mine Age is nothing in respect of Thee and verily every Man living is altogether Vanity And now LORD what is my Hope Truly my Hope is even in Thee Deliver me from all mine Offences and O spare me a little that I may recover my Strength before I go hence and be no more seen  Such Thoughts as these of our Friend's and of our own Mortality would excite us to pre∣pare for our own Change  And as this Form of Procession is an Em∣blem of our dying shortly after our Friend so the carrying of Ivy or Laurel or Rosemary or some of those EverGreens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality It is as much as  to say That though the Body be dead yet the Soul is EverGreen and always in Life It is not like the Body and those other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seasons no  Autumn  nor  Winter  can make a Change in it but it is unalterably the same perpetually in Life and never dying  The  Romans  and other Heathens upon this Occasion made Use of Cypress which being once cut will never flourish nor grow any more as an Emblem of their dying for ever and being no more in Life But instead of that the antient Christians used the Things before mentioned they  Haedera quoque vel laurus hujusmodi quae semper ser∣vant virorem in sarchophago corpori substernuntur ad sig∣nificandum quod qui moriuntur in Christo vivere nec desi∣nunt Nam licet mundo moriantur secundum corpus tamen secundum animam vivunt reviviscunt Deo  Durand Rit Lib    C    de Offic Mort  laid them under the Corps in the Grave to signify that they who die in CHRIST do not cease to live For though as to the Body they die to the World yet as to their Souls they live to GOD  And as the carrying of these EverGreens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality so it is also of the Resurrection of the Body For as these Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up but only cut down and will at the returning Season revive and spring up again so the Body like them is but cut down for a while  and will rise and shoot up again at the Resur∣rection For as the Prophet  Isaiah  says  Isa lxiii  Our Bones shall flourish like an Herb  It was customary  Greg C  among the antient  Jews  as they returned from the Grave to pluck up the Grass two or three Times and then throw it behind them saying these Words of the Psalmist  They shall flourish out of the City like Grass upon the Earth  Which they did to shew that the Body though dead should spring up again as the Grass Thus by these two antient Ceremonies we have placed before our Eyes our Mortality and Immortality the one speaks the Death of the Body the other the Life of the Soul nay and the Life of the Body too for like that Herb we carry it is not quite pluck'd up but shall one Day be alive again When it hath laid in the Earth the  Winter  Season the Continuance of this World and the Warmth and Influence of the  Spring  is come the joyful Spring of the Re∣surrection it shall be enliven'd and shoot up and eternally flourish  Cor i  For this Corruptible must put on Incorruption and this Mortal must put on Immortality O Death where is thy Sting O Grave where is thy Victory Thanks be to GOD who giveth us the Victory through our LORD JESUS CHRIST  There is another Custom used in some Places at the Procession of Funerals which pays a due Honour to the Dead and gives Comfort and Consolation to the Living and that is the carrying out the Dead with Psalmody This was an antient Custom of the Church for in some of the earliest Ages they carried out their Dead to the Grave with singing of Psalms and Hymns Thus  Socrates  tells us That when the Body of  Babylas  the Martyr was removed by the Order of  Julian  the Apo∣state the Christians  Hoi kata  c Soc Lib    C    with their Women and Children rejoiced and sung Psalms all the Way as they bore the Corps from  Dauphne  to  Antioch  Thus was  Epitaphium  Pauli Hicrom Ep  Ibid  in Vit  Paul  Paula  buried at  Bethle∣hem  thus did St  Anthony  bury  Paul  the Her∣mite and thus were the Generality of Men buried after the three first Centuries when Persecution ceased In Imitation of this it is still customary in several Parts of this Nation to carry out the Dead with singing of Psalms and Hymns of Triumph to shew that they have ended their spiritual Warfare that they have finished their Course with Joy and are become Conquerors which surely is a Matter of no little Consolation for the loosing of our Friend And how becoming is it to pay such  Honour to the Body How is it imitating the blessed Angels who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul and carrying it to Heaven For as they rejoyce  at her Conversion on Earth  so most certainly they rejoyce at her going to Heaven And as they rejoyce at the carrying of the Soul thither so we in Imitation of them at the carrying out the Body to the Grave They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin we that the Body out of a World of Trouble they that the Soul can sin no more we that the Body can no more suffer they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Happiness we that the Body rests from its Labours  When therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation and this decent Cere∣mony is perform'd let it also have a Share of our Thoughts and excite in us Joy and Com∣fort and Thanksgiving and Praise And when these Customs are so observed they will be of great Advantage to us making us still fitter for the heavenly Life And surely a Thing of this Good and Profit is much to be preferr'd to what hath in it nothing but Undecency and Irreverence such is our laughing and jesting and telling of News when we accompany a Neighbour to the Grave There is indeed a Mean to be observed as in all other Things so in this we must neither be too sad nor  too merry we must not be so merry as to throw off all the Signs of Affection and Love all the Tokens of Esteem and Humanity nor must we  Thess i  sorrow even as others which have no Hope But we must  Jam v  be so merry as to be able to sing Psalms and so afflicted as to be ex∣cited to pray  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER III  THE antient Christians testified their Abhor∣rence of Heathen Rites They rejected there∣fore the Pagan Custom of burning the Dead de∣positing the inanimate Body  entire  in the Ground The  carrying forth  to the Church and from thence to the Grave was performed by near Rela∣tions or Persons of such Dignity as the Cir∣cumstances of the Deceased required  Singing of Psalms  in Exultation for the Conquest of the de∣ceased Friend over  Hell Sin  and  Death  was the great Ceremony used in all Funeral Processions among the antient Christians  Paulam translatam fuisse Episcoporum manibus cervicem fe∣retro subjicientibus Durant p  St Jerom in the Epitaph of  Paula  informs us that Bishops were  what in modern Language we call  Underbearers  at her FuneralThe learned Durant  Duranti de Ritibus p  gives us many Quotations from the antient Christian Writers to prove that those of the highest Orders of Clergy thought it not a Reproach to their Dignity to  carry  the Bier How different an Idea of this Office pre∣vails in our TimesSomething instead of the  Pall  In Nobilibus aureum  velamentum

 which are still in Use on particular Occasions in Funeral ProcessionsIt appears by Du∣rant that this Custom has been of a long standing  We farther learn from this Ritualist that it was customary to invite the  Poor  Praetereà convocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacerdotes et Religiosi sed et  Egeni Pauperes  Had our famous Poet Mr  Pope  an eye to this in ordering by Will  poor Men  to support his Pall  to Funerals  I find a beautiful Thought on this Subject  Mr Strutt in his English Aera tells us that Sir Robert Knolles in the th Year of Henry IV died at his Manor in Norfolk and his dead Body was brought in a Litter to London with great Pomp and much Torch Light and it was buried in the White Friars Church  where was done for him a solemne Obsequie with a great Feast and  lyberall Dole to the Poore  This Custom of giving a Funeral Feast to the Chief Mourners was universally practised all over the Kingdom as well  as giving Alms to the Poor  in Proportion to the Quality and Finances of the Deceased  Vol II p  in St Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus cited by Durant which I flatter myself will be thought to have deserved a translation  The  Poor  also shed  their  Tearsprecious and fruitful Tears that washed away the Sins of the Deceased They let fall Floods of  redeeming  Tears  It should seem to have been from such figurative Expressions as these in the first Christian Writers  literally  understood that the Romanists have derived their superstitious Doctrine of praying for the Dead  Funeral Sermons  also are of great Antiquity  Ceterum priusquam Corpus humo injecta contegatur defunctus  oratione funebri  laudabatur Durant p    Doles  were used at Funerals as we learn from St Chrysostom    Homilia xxxii in Matthei cap non  to procure Rest to the Soul of the Deceased and that he might find his Judge pro∣pitious  Dr Browne in his  Urne Burial  observes that the Custom of carrying the Corps as it were out of the  World with its Feet forward is not inconsonant to Reason  as contrary to the native Posture of Man and his Production first into it  It may be added to Mr Bourne's Observations on  Evergreens  used at Funerals  Dr Trusler in his Chronology tells us that in the Year  Yew Trees  were encouraged in Churchyards as being fenced from Cattle for the making of Bows Hence their Frequency in Churchyards This seems to me the Observation of one totally ignorant of ecclesiastical Antiquities Are not all Plantation Grounds fenced from Cattle And whence is it that there is usually but  one  Yew Tree in each Churchyard How much more probable the Con∣jecture of the learned Author of the Vulgar Errors  that the planting of  Yew Trees  in Churchyards seems to derive its Origin from antient Funeral Rites in which the Doctor conjectures from its  perpetual Verdure  it was used as an Emblem of the ResurrectionHe observes farther that the christian Custom of deck∣ing the Coffin with  Bay  is a most elegant Emblem It is said that this Tree when seemingly dead will revive from the Root and its dry Leaves resume their wonted Verdure  The Custom of laying flat  Cicero de legibus  Lapidea Mensa  terra operitur humato Corpore

Persons on which are inscribed Epi∣taphs containing the Name Age Character c has been transmitted from very antient Times as appears from Cicero and others I cannot better close these additional Remarks on the obsolete Cus∣tom of carrying  Evergreens  at Funerals than with a Description of it in the Words of the elegant Mr Gay in his Pastoral DirgeHe paints the rustic  vulgar Ceremonies with

Churches Of strawing Flowers on the Grave the Antiquity of these Customs the Innocency of them  IN some Country Churches 'tis customary to hang  a Garland of Flowers  over the Seats of  deceased Virgins  as a Token of Esteem and Love and an Emblem of their Reward in the heavenly Church  This Custom perhaps may be look'd upon as sprung from that ancient Custom of the Heathens of  crowning  their  Corps  with  Gar∣lands  in Token of Victory But Mr  Bingham  tells us That we find not this Custom used by the  Ancients  in their  Funeral Rites  For as he observes the Heathen in  Minutius  makes it one Topick of Accusation against them  Min P  Coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis  Bing Vol    P    That they did not crown their Sepulchres  But if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens they had a Custom of using Crowns of Flowers if we may believe  Cassalion  who tells us  Euit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi slorum coronas  c Cass de Vet Sacr Christ P    It was a Custom of the ancient Christians to place Crowns of  Flowers at the Heads of deceased Virgins for which he quotes  Damascen Gregory Nyssen  St  Jerom  and St  Austin  And this hath pro∣bably been the Original of this Custom among the Vulgar  That other Custom of  strawing Flowers  up∣on the  Graves  of their departed Friends is also derived from a Custom of the ancient Church For it was usual in those Times for the common Sort of People to straw the Graves of their Friends with various Flowers Of this there are two notable Instances taken No∣tice of by  Cassalion  and several other Ritualists The one is that of St  Ambrose  in his  Funeral Oration  on the Death of  Valentinian  Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus asperagam sed spiritum ejus Christi odore perfundam spargant alii plenis lilia cala∣this Nobis lilium est Christus Hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo  Ambros Orat Funebri ae obitu Valentin  I will not sprinkle his Grave with Flowers but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST  Let  others scatter Baskets of Flowers CHRIST is our Lilly and with this will I consecrate his Relicks  The other is that of St  Jerom  in his E∣pistle to  Pammachius  upon the Death of his Wife  Caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt violas rosas lilia floresque purpureos dolorem pectoris his osfi∣ciis consolantur  Pammachius  noster sanctum favillam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat  Hieron Epist ad Pam∣machtum de obitu Uxoris  Whilst other Husbands strawed Vio∣lets  and Roses and Lillies and purple Flow∣ers upon the Graves of their Wives and com∣forted themselves with such like Offices  Pam∣machius  bedew'd her Ashes and venerable Bones with the Balsam of Alms  Now these Instances tho' they justly com∣mend these other Actions and wisely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with Flowers yet they no Way decry these ancient Customs These lower Marks of Es∣teem and Honour which the  Vulgar  paid to the Remains of their Friends were in them∣selves harmless and innocent and had no Censure and as they were so so should the present Customs be without any being full as harmless and innocent as the other  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER IV  I Have seen many of the  Garlands  our Author here speaks of in Village Churches in the South of England The Custom seems to be en∣tirely laid aside in the North  Not  entirely  I saw lately in the Churches of  Wolsingham  and  Stanhope  in the County of  Durham  Specimens of these Gar∣lands The form of a Woman's Glove cut in white Paper hangs in each of them  It is undoubtedly  of very high AntiquityIn the earlier Ages of the Church  Virginity  out of Deference it should seem to the  Virgin Mother  was honoured with almost  divine  Adoration There is little Doubt but that  Nunneries  and this  Garlana  claim one common Origin  Durant  Condito et curato funere solebant Nonnulli antiquitus tumu∣lum floribus adspergere Durant p  tells us the antient Christians af∣ter the Funeral used to scatter  Flowers  on the TombThere is a great Deal of Learning in Moresin  Sepulchra funeralibus expletis quandoque  storibus  odoramen∣tisque fuisse sparsa legimus Idemque mos cum in plerisque Re∣gionibus Italiae tum maximè

other Flowers but more especially those of Lovers round whose Tombs they often planted Rose Trees Some traces he observes of this antient Custom are yet remaining in the Churchyard of Oakley in Surry which is full of Rose Trees planted round the Graves  Anglo Saxon Aera Vol I p  Mr Pennant in his Tour in Scotland remarks a singular Custom in many Parts of North Britain of painting on the Doors and

of expressing Sorrow compleatly ridiculous but the subjoining of a  N B  "These are Tears"  Gay's Dirge  CHAP V  Of Bowing towards the Altar at the first coming into the Church a Custom generally observed by ignorant People its Meaning and Antiquity  WE may observe the Generality of old People among the Commonalty as they enter into the Church to turn their Faces to∣wards the  Altar  and bow or kneel that Way This no Doubt is the Remains of that an∣cient Custom of the Church of worshipping toward the East For in the ancient Church they worshipped that Way upon several Ac∣counts  First  That by so worshipping they might lift up their Minds to GOD who is called the Light and the Creator of Light And therefore St  Austin  says  Cum ad orationem stamus ad orientem covertimur unde caelum surgit c Ut admoneatur animus ad naturam excellentiorem se convertere id est ad Dominum  Aug de Serm Domini in Mont Lib    Cap    When we pray standing we turn our Faces to the East from whence the Day springs that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent Na∣ture namely The LORD  Secondly  That for as much as Man was driven out of  Para∣dise  which is towards the East he ought to look that Way which is an Emblem of his  Desire to return thither St  Damascen  there∣fore tells us That  Ibid  because the Scripture says That GOD planted  Paradise  in  Eden  to∣wards the East where he  placed the Man which he had formed  whom he punish'd with Banish∣ment upon his Transgression and made him dwell over against  Paradise  in the western Part we therefore pray says he being in Quest of our ancient Country and as it were  panting  after it do worship GOD that Way  Thirdly  It was used when any were baptized They first turn'd their Faces to the West and so renounc'd the Devil and then to the East and made their Covenant with CHRIST  Last∣ly  They prayed that Way believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens  For as the Lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall the Coming of the Son of Man be and he is to come in like Manner as he ascended  And that he ascended up Eastward from Mount  Oli∣vet  St  Ibid  Damascen  assures us For says he when he ascended into Heaven he was taken up Eastward and his Disciples worshipped him that Way And therefore chiefly it was that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the East and that many of our own Church at this Day turn their  St  Damasc Lib    C    Orthod Fid  Faces to that Quarter of the World at the Repetition of the Creed  What may more confirm this and speak it to have been the universal Opinion of the Church is the ancient Custom of burying the Corps with the Feet to the East and the Head to the West which Custom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of  England  This was observed for the same Reason That at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from the oriental Part of Heaven our Bodies might be found in a praying Posture with their Faces towards the East  Our learned Countryman  Gregory  tells us  That the holy Men of  Jerusalem  hold a Tra∣dition generally received from their Ancients that our SAVIOUR himself was buried with his Face and Feet towards the East  It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land And  Bede  says  Introcuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est viderunt angelum sedentem ad meridianam partem loci illius ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu hoc enim erat in dextris quod nimirum corpus quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum dexteram necesse est habere ad austrum  Bed in Dic Sanct Paschae Tom    That as the Holy Women enter'd at the Eastern Part into the Roundhouse which is hewn out in the Rock they saw the Angel sitting at the South Part of the Place where the Body of JESUS had lain  that is at his Right Hand for undoubtedly his Body having his Face upwards and its Head to the West must have its Right Hand to the South  Cassalion  says  Adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respici∣endi in orientem ut non solum ipsi viventes hoc in eorum precibus exacte servarent verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent  Cass de Vet Rit Christ P    The Faithful of old were so observing of this Ceremony of looking towards the East that they not only strictly observed it in their Prayers when liv∣ing but even when they were dead their Bodies were placed with their Faces upwards in the Sepulchre looking towards the East  The learned Dr  Comber  in his Discourse of the solemn Interment hath these Words upon this subject  We may note the Positure and Position of the Corps which among the Chri∣stians hath always been to turn the Feet to the East with the Head to the West that so they may be ready to meet the LORD whom the Ancients did believe should ap∣pear in the oriental Part of Heaven  Durand Rat Lib    Cap  Or as our ingenious Mr  Gregory  believes That they might be in the Posture of Prayer with their Faces to the East as soon as they were raised There are some ancient Authors tell us That the old Inhabitants of  Attica  buried thus before  the Days of  Solon  who as they report con∣vinced the  Athenians  that the Island of  Sa∣lamis  did of Right belong to them by shew∣ing them dead Bodies looking that Way and Sepulchres turned towards the East as they used to bury  Diog Laert Vit Solon  c And the Scholiast upon  Thucidides  says It was the Manner of all the  Greeks  to bury their Dead thus Though a learned modern Writer supposes these Authors mistaken and cites  Plutarch  and  Elian  to prove that the  Athenians  turned their Dead towards the West However it is certain that all Na∣tions had one certain Way of placing the Corps from which they would not vary and we Christians have so great Antiquity for our Custom that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it  No Doubt but this learned Man had great Reason for this Conclusion as well knowing that this ancient Rite was struck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries as a filly Fancy and an idle Dream Who never would observe it were it not that they are sometimes obliged but would with those who are not obliged act the very Reverse and bury North and South I wish there were no powerfuller Enemies to it than them now a Days but  as a Man's Enemies are too often those of his own Houshold  so 'tis to be lamented that some who pre∣tend  to be of our own Church are upon all Occasions secret Advocates against this Cere∣mony When therefore there is such Oppo∣sition without and such Treachery within 'tis high Time to be on the Guard against our Enemies least a Ceremony so venerable for its Antiquity and so useful in its Observation be laid aside Was it but for this one Thing that it speaks the Hope of the whole Christian Church since the earliest Times of Christianity about the Resurrection of the same Body It is too true that there are some at this Time of the Day as well as were in the Days of the Apostle who think  it a Thing incredible that GOD should raise the Dead  some really dis∣believing the Resurrection of any Body and others that of the same Body But as long as this Ceremony is in Being it will always be a ready Proof that the whole Christian Church did not only believe the Resurrection of the Body but of that very Body which was laid down in the Grave For they observed it that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment which certainly implies that they believed that very Body should rise again  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER V  WE may add to Mr Bourne's Remarks that the Custom is  still  retained in many Churches of turning to the Altar while the Congregation are re∣peating the CreedThe Forms are both derived to us from the same Origin We need not hesi∣tate to pronounce as well the  Bowings  Aulam regiam id est Ecclesiam ingredientes  ad altare in∣clinamus  quod quasi Regem milites adoramus eterni enim Regis milites sumus Durandi Rational p  The learned Mr Mede tells us that what reverential Guise Ceremony or Worship they used at their Ingress into Churches in the Ages next to the Apostles and some he believes they did is wholly buried in Silence and Oblivion The Jews used to  bow  themselves towards the  MercySeat  the Christians after them in the Greek and Oriental Churches have Time out of Mind and without any known Beginning used to  bow  in like mannerthey do it at this Day See Bingham's Antiquities  as the  turnings about to  the East or Altar to be supersti∣tiousThey are alike Vestiges of the antient po∣pish  Ceremonial Law  One who has left a severe Satire on the Re∣tainers of those Forms and Ceremonies that lean to∣wards popish Superstition tells us  Hickeringill's Ceremony Monger p  If I were a  Papist  or  Anthropomorphite  who believes that God is enthroned in the  East  like a grave old King I profess I would bow and cringe as well as any Limberham of them all and pay my Adoration to that Point of the Compass  the East  But if  Men believe that the Holy One who inhabits Eternity is also omnipresent why do not they make correspondent Ceremonies of Adoration to every Point of the Compass  Concession must be made by every Advocate for  manly  and  rational Worship  that there is nothing more in the  East  than in the Belfry at the West End or in the Body of the Church We wonder therefore how ever this Custom was retained by Protestants The  Cringes  and  Bowings  of the Roman Catholics to the Altar is in Adoration of the  corporal  I find in a curious

still retain and Bede will have it to be the Posture of our Saviour  This judicious Observer proceeds  That Christians buried their Dead  on their Backs  or in a  supine  Position seems agreeable to

the Time of Cockcrow Whether evil Spirits wander about in the Time of Night and whe∣ther they fly away at the Time of Cockcrow Reflections upon this encouraging us to have Faith and Trust in God  IT is a received Tradition among the Vul∣gar That at the Time of Cockcrowing the Midnight Spirits forsake these lower Re∣gions and go to their proper Places They wander say they about the World from the dead Hour of Night when all Things are bu∣ried in Sleep and Darkness till the Time of Cockcrowing and then they depart Hence it is that in CountryPlaces where the Way of Life requires more early Labour they al∣ways go chearfully to Work at that Time whereas if they are called abroad sooner they are apt to imagine every Thing they see or hear to be a wandring Ghost  Shakespear  hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion in his Tragedy of  Hamlet  Ber  It was about to speak when the Cock crew  Hor  And then it started like a guilty Thing  Upon a dreadful Summons I have heard  The Cock that is the Trumpet to the Day  Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding Throat  Awake the God of Day And at his Warning  Whether in Sea or Fire in Earth or Air  The extravagant and erring

Birth is celebrated  The Bird of Dawning singeth all Night long  And then they say No Spirit doth walk abroad  The Nights are wholsome then no Planet strikes  No Fairy takes no Witch hath Power to harm  So gracious and so hallowed is that Time  Now to shew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion I shall consider  First  What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night And  Secondly  Whether they are ob∣liged to go away at Cockcrow  I believe none who assent to the Truth of Divine Revelation deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men the one to guard and protect them and the other to harm and work their Ruin that the one are those  Heb i  ministring Spirits which are sent out to minister to the Heirs of Salvation  the other the  roaring Lion  and his Instruments  Job ii  who wander too and fro in the Earth these  Matt xii  un∣clean Spirits who wander through dry Places seeking Rest and finding none  NOR I believe will it be question'd that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits and that many with our SAVIOUR'S  Disciples have been  affrighted and cried out  not only with supposing they had seen but really with seeing a Spirit Of this the Testi∣mony of all Ages and Scripture it self are a sufficient Demonstration  What then could these have ordinarily been but the Appearances of some of those  Angels  of  Light  or Darkness For I am far from thinking that either the Ghosts of the Damn'd or the Happy either the Soul of a  Dives  or a  Lazarus  returns here any more For as  St Athanasius  observes  Hai en tois naois  c Athan  Tom P  These Visions and Shades of the Saints which appear in the Temples and at the Tombs are not the Souls of the Saints themselves but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes  Not that GOD could not remand the Ghost of  Samuel  and order it again to visit the Earth as he made  Moses  and  Elias  to ap∣pear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration but that a Thing of this Nature was very uncom∣mon and seldom happen'd  Taking it therefore for granted that there have been Apparitions of Angels I believe it will also be owned that these Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night And truly was there no direct Proof of this yet the No∣tion of their appearing in the Night being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an  Apparition would almost perswade us that the Night is the most proper Time for such Appearances Whether it is that the Fables of Nurses  Lock  on Human Underst  as an ingenious Author imagines  have so associated the Idea of Spirit to the Night that the one never appears with∣out the other  or whether there is some∣thing in the Presence of Night some Awful∣ness and Horrour which naturally dispose the Mind of Man to these Reflections I am indeed very inclinable to believe that these Legendary Stories of Nurses and old Women are the Occasion of much greater Fears than People without them would generally have of these Things but I cannot help thinking that the Presence of Night would naturally lead a Man to some Reflection of Spirits without any such Cause as that learned Author men∣tions There are some particular Times which will naturally raise some particular Thoughts Thus on a bright sunny Day we are naturally disposed to Mirth and Gaiety when the Day overcasts or the Weather is hazy we then turn indolent and dull and sooth our selves in Melancholly if it Thunder and Lighten we think of the Day of Judgment and sudden Death And thus also the Night as it inclines us to grave and serious Thoughts raises in us  Horrour and Dismay and makes us afraid even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear so it may of it self be look'd upon as a natural Cause of such Reflections  But however this be we must necessarily own that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night or we must give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages to Historians prophane and sacred and the wisest and best in the Ge∣nerations of Men  In the Heathen World there are many In∣stances of which I shall only mention this one out of  Plutarch  In Vit Mar  Brut  Trans Duke  One Night before  Brutus  passed out of  Asia  he was very late all alone in his Tent with a dim Light burning by him all the Rest of the Army being husht and silent and musing with himself and very thoughtful as he turn'd his Eye to the Door he saw a strange and terrible Appear∣ance of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without speaking  Bru∣tus  boldly asked him What art thou Man or God Or upon what Business do'st thou come to us The Spirit answer'd I am thy  Evil Genius  thou shalt see me at  Philippi  to which  Brutus  not at all disturbed re∣ply'd Then I will see thee there  In the sacred Writings we have  Job  Job  terri∣fied with Visions of the Night  when deep Sleep falleth upon Men Fear came upon him and Trembling which made all his Bones to shake then a Spirit passed by before his Face and the Hair of his Flesh stood up In the Night  Gen xxxii  Jacob  wrestled with the Angel in the Night an Angel delivered  Acts xii  Peter  out of Prison  c  But though it be true from Scripture that there have been nightly Apparitions yet these are chiefly of good Angels whereas this Opi∣nion principally means the Appearances of evil Spirits It must be owned indeed that the Appearances of evil Spirits if litterally are yet but very seldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture but however that they wander and appear at Night is very deducible from if not litterally mentioned in it Their's  is the Land of Darkness and the Shadow of Death They are reserved under Chains of Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day and we know that every one that doth Evil naturally hateth the Light They therefore love Darkness rather than Light because their Deeds are Evil  The Night therefore in a more especial Manner seems to be their  Hour  and the  Power of Darkness  This was the Opinion of the  Jews  as may be learned from the Fear of the Apostles when  they saw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night coming to them upon the Wa∣ters  Matt xiv  they were affrighted and cryed out sup∣posing they had seen a Spirit  Doctor  Whitby  upon this Place says  That the  Jews  had then an Opinion of hurtful Spirits walking in the Night is evident from the seventy who render'd  from the Pestilence walking in Darkness  Apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei  From  the Fear of the Devils that walk in the Night  And that this was also the Opinion of the ancient Christians is evident not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches the Evening Midnight Cockcrowing and the Morning which were the Military Divi∣sions of the Night and which they  Si quidem in Nocte Stationes Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernuntur  Isidore  Lib de Eccle Offici Cap  observed to guard their Souls from the silent Incursions of evil Spirits as the others did those of the Enemy but also from their many Relations of such Appearances  Cassian  in giving an Ac∣count of the Watching of the ancient Monks and their being assaulted with Midnight Spi∣rits tells us That at the Beginning of the Monkish Life  Tanta nam{que} erat eorum feritas ut vix pauciTole∣rare habitationem solitudinis possentIta eorum atrocitas grassabatur frequentes ac visibiles sentiebantur aggressus ut non auderent omnes pariter noctibus obdormire sed vi∣cissim aliis degustantibus somnum alii vigilias celebrantes Psalmis Orationibus seu Lectionibus in haerebant  Cassian  Coll Cap  the Rage of the Midnight  Spirits was so great that but few and these too Men of Age and unshaken Resolution were able to endure the Life in the Desart For such was their Fierceness that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monastery they would have made frequent and visible Incur∣sions Insomuch that they never all slept at the same Time but took it by Turns some watching the Rest and exercising themselves in singing Psalms in Praying and Reading And St  Athanasius  in his Life of  Anthony  the Hermit tells Of many Conflicts that good Man had in the Night with the Powers of Darkness whilst they endeavoured to batter him  from the strong Holds  of his Faith And what can our Church chiefly mean in the  Col∣lect for Aid against Perils  but that GOD would send us Protection from all the Spirits of Dark∣ness these Midnight Wanderers of the World And for this Reason every good Man when he lies down to sleep at Night desires the great  Keeper of  Israel  who never slumbereth nor sleep∣eth to send his holy Angels to pitch their Tents round about him  and banish from him the Spi∣rits of the Night  So far then this Tradition is just and good that there are at Midnight Spirits who wander about the World going  too and fro in the Earth seeking whom they may devour  Let us now in the next Place enquire what Truth there is in the other Part of it namely That they al∣ways fly away at Cockcrow  This Opinion whatever Truth there may be in it is certainly very ancient We have it mentioned by the Christian Poet  Prudentius  who flourished in the Beginning of the fourth Century as a Tradition of Common Belief His Words are these  Ferunt Vagantes Daemones  Loetos Tenebris Noctium  Gallo canente exterritos  Sparsim timere cedere  Invisa nam Vicinitas  Lucis salutis numinis  Rupto Tenebrarum situ  Noctis Fugat satellites  Hoc esse signum proescii  Norunt repromissoe spei  Qua Nos soporis Liberi  Speramus adventum Dei  They say the wandering Powers that love  The silent Darkness of the Night  At Cockcrowing give o'er to rove  And all in Fear do take their Flight  The approaching salutary Morn  The Approach divine of hated Day  Makes Darkness to its Place return  And drives the Midnight Ghosts away  They know that this an Emblem is  Of what preceeds our lasting Bliss  That Morn when Graves give up their Dead  In certain Hope to meet their GOD  Cassian  also who lived in the same Century giving an Account of a Multitude of Devils who had been Abroad in the Night says  Aurora itaque superveniente cum omnis haec ab oculis evanisset Daemonum multitudo  Cass  Coll C  That as soon as the Morn approached they all vanished and fled away By this we see that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day but what Reason they had for it ex∣cept some Relations of the disappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour I never yet have met with But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night Things of very memora∣ble Worth which might perhaps raise the pious Credulity of some Men to imagine that there was something more in it than in other Times It was about the Time of Cockcrow∣ing when our Saviour was born and the An∣gels sung the first ChristmasCarol to the poor Shepherds in the Fields of  Bethlehem  Now  it may be presum'd that as the Saviour of the World was then born and the  heavenly Host  had then descended to proclaim the News that the Angels of Darkness would be terrified and confounded and immediately fly away And perhaps this Consideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion for as this may easily be supposed so perhaps it has been ima∣gin'd that the Spirits of Darkness having al∣ways in Memory that fatal Hour are startled and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it  It was also about this Time when he rose from the Dead And when the great  Sun of Righteousness  was risen upon the World no Wonder that all the Clouds of Darkness and Wickedness were dispell'd no Wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to shew their Heads And this perhaps hath been another Reason of their imagining that Spi∣rits go away at that Time  A third Reason is that Passage in the Book of  Genesis  where Jacob  wrestled with the Angel for a Blessing  where the Angel says unto him  Gen xxxii  Let me go for the Day breaketh  But indeed this Tradition seems more espe∣cially to have risen from some particular Cir∣cumstances attending the Time of Cockcrow∣ing and which as  Prudentius  seems to say  above are an Emblem of the Approach of the Day of the Resurrection For when we leave the World we lie down in our Graves and  Rest from our Labours  Sleep and Darkness lay hold upon us and there we abide till the last Day appear when the Voice of the ArchAngel shall awake us that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day And when we leave the common Business and Care of Life we lie down in our Beds as in a Grave buried as it were in Sleep and Darkness till the Cock crow the welcome Messenger of the News of Day  The Circumstances therefore of the Time of Cockcrowing being so natural a Figure and Representation of the Morning of the Resur∣rection the Night so shadowing out the Night of the Grave the third Watch being as some suppose the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at the Noise of the  Cock  awaken∣ing sleepy Man and telling him as it were  the Night is far spent the Day is at Hand  re∣presenting so naturally the Voice of the ArchAngel awakening the Dead and calling up the Righteous to everlasting Day so natural∣ly does the Time of Cockcrowing shadow out these Things that probably some good wellmeaning Men have been brought to believe that the very Devils themselves when the Cock crew and reminded them of them did fear and tremble and shun the Light  Now in Answer to the first of these Conjec∣tures 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity and because of our Saviour's Birth and that  Com∣pany of the heavenly Host  might be afraid and retire into thick Darkness yet it will not hence follow that it always happens so at the Time of Cockcrowing For if they did fly away that Morning the Circumstances of our Saviour's Birth the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire their Musick and their Pre∣sence were the Occasion of it And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time should always at the Time of Cockcrowing drive them away rather than when they remember it at another no Reason seems to be given  As to the second Conjecture namely That it was the Time of our Saviour's Rising from the Dead I answer in the same Manner That tho' it be allowed that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkness upon our Saviour's Rising from the Dead yet why it should occasion them always to do so at that Time no Reason can be given  As to the third Conjecture it is easy to observe That this was a good Angel where∣as they that shun the Light are bad ones This was the Angel of the Covenant the Cre∣ator of Light and the Lord of the Day We  may therefore as well imagine that it was not in his Power to get out of the Arms of  Jacob  without saying  Let me go  as to suppose he was obliged to go because he said  the Day breaketh  The meaning of which Words  According to  Willet  is not that the Angel was gone to the blessed Company of the Angels to sing their Morning Hymn to GOD as the  Hebrews  imagine For the Angels not only in the Morning but at other Times are exercised in praising GOD But the Angel thus speaketh according to the Custom of Men having now taken the Form and Shape of a Man as tho' he had hast to other Business and leaving  Jacob  also to his Affairs  The last Conjecture of the Rise of this Tra∣dition seems to carry greater Probability than the others For as these Things are a Repre∣sentation of the Circumstances of the Morning of the Resurrection so they must sure enough bring that last Day into Remembrance and they never can do so but as surely they must create Terrour and Confusion in all the Devils and Ghosts of the Night Whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliss but be hurried into that  Matt xxv  e∣verlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his  Angels  But that these Things are the Occa∣sion of their flying away at the Approach of Day is not to be supposed On the contrary the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Daylight and are Midday Devils as well as Midnight ones For the Devil is incessant in his Temptations and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night tho' perhaps has seldom appear'd but in Darkness Thus St  Austin  in one of his Meditations  Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus libera nos ab ad∣versario nostro quotidiano qui sive dormiamus sive vigile∣musdie ac nocte fraudibus artibus nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens ut interficiat animas nostras  Aug Sol Cap    We implore thee O GOD that thou wouldest deliver us from our daily Enemy who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us Day and Night sleeping and waking and both openly and in secret shooting at us his poisoned Arrows that he may destroy our Souls  And now what though this be true as it most certainly seems to be so that at the chearful Hour of Cockcrowing the wander∣ing Ghosts are not driven away but still continue going too and fro What tho' then their Power be still the same and their Inten∣tions as fully bent to do Evil Consider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World and there will be found as much Safe∣ty for us in the Midst of Evil Spirits as if  they absented at that Time The Almighty Power of GOD is the same then as at other Times nothing but that preserved us conti∣nually and that will always be able to pre∣serve us However great may be the Malice of Devils however desirous of working our Ruin tho' they watch all Opportunities and are unwearied in tempting us  yet the loving Kindness of the LORD endureth for Ever and his Mercy is over all his Works He will not suffer our Foot to be moved he that keepeth us will not sleep We shall not be afraid of the Sun by Day nor the Moon by Night For the Pesti∣lence that walketh in Darkness nor for the Sick∣ness that destroyeth in the Noonday  Are we then afraid of Darkness and the Pre∣sence of Night Let us remember the Creator of them and have but Faith in him and we shall find  our Night turned into Day In his Light shall we see Light  We shall be as se∣cure as if there was no Darkness about us as well knowing that that GOD which protects us sees through the thickest  Mediums  and the darkest Night  For with him the Darkness is no Darkness but the Night is as clear as the Day the Darkness and Light to him are both alike  Or are we afraid of that old Serpent the Devil that nightly Rambler of the World who is a Lover of Night and Darkness Let us trust in GOD and no Harm shall happen  to us If we will but  fear no Evil his Rod and his Staff shall comfort us though we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death For GOD hath reserved the Devil and his Angels in everlasting Chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great Day  Though therefore he is permitted to wander the World yet he is so chain'd up that without GOD'S parti∣cular Order or Permission he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men and he is so re∣served and kept in Darkness that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be visible to them without the Permission of GOD So little Reason hath every good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell  When then the Night pours out her Ter∣rours covers all Things with Darkness and strikes thee with Horrour  Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills from whence cometh thy Help  and thou shalt clearly see that our  Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee  Quia filiis lucis in noctibus dies est Quando enim sine lumine est cui lumen in corde est Aut quando sol ei dies non est cui sol dies Christus est  Cyprian de Orat Dom  For to those who are the  Children of the Light  the Day shineth in the Night They are never without Light whose Hearts are illuminated never without Sunshine whose Sun is CHRIST In short then if thou fear Darkness look up  to CHRIST and thou hast eternal Day if the Angels of Darkness look but up with the Eye of Faith and thou shalt  see the Moun∣tains full of Chariots and Horses of Fire  Thou shalt see as did the Servant of the Prophet  Elisha That they who be with us are more than they who are against us  No Matter then whe∣ther the Spirits of the Night go away or only tremble at the Time of Cockcrowing For sure we are  that the Angel of the LORD tar∣rieth round about them that fear him and deli∣vereth them nay That GOD himself will arise and scatter his Enemies and make them that hate him to flie before him  And if GOD  be for us who can be against us  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER VI  MR Bourne might have stiled this Chapter  A Sermon on Spiritwalking  and yet I can∣not help thinking that the  Nurse  prevails over the  Priest  in it The good Man it must be al∣lowed has played the Conjurer so far as to  raise  us  Spirits  but does not seem to have had so much of the  Scholar  in him as to have been able to  lay  them  The Gay and the Witty will no doubt laugh at every Thing he has advanced Perhaps it will be granted on all Hands that he has not thrown any new  Lights  on the  dark  Subject I make no Pre∣tensions to any Abilities for discussing the Question and am of Opinion that as we know so little of the  invisible World  we cannot express ourselves with too much Diffidence in speaking of itIt must however be allowed that Writers of the highest Character for Probity and Knowledge have transmitted to us Accounts of  Spirits  and  Appari∣tions  Fancy Imagination Misinterpretations of the sacred Writings on that Subject or Credulity must have  deceived them  For it is impossible to be∣lieve them guilty of the Baseness of an  Intention  to  deceive us  The frequent Impostures I shall only instance the CockLane Ghost in our own Times that are to be met with of this Kind naturally incline us to believe that all such Relations are either the Forgeries of cunning Men or the idle Tales of weak ones It is impossible to follow our Author through all the  Howbeits Moreovers and Neverthelesses  of his tedious Discourse but to one Thing in his  Peroration  we readily sub∣scribe our most unfeigned Assent it is  That a good Man has not the least Reason to fear the  Spite  and  Malice  of all the Devils in Hell  Our Divine discovers every where an Intention of rooting out the  old Man  from the Hearts of his Readers I shall be sparing of  my  Quotations of  Chapter  and  Verse  as I do not think this a proper Place to imitate him in and purpose only on the present Occasion to eraze the Vestiges of the  old  Woman  the Impressions of which are still too vi∣sibly to be traced on human Nature  It was the Fashion when Mr Bourne wrote that Clergymen should lard every Composition with Scripture Phrases and nothing seems to have been thought palatable by them in which every Period was not seasoned with a Spice of DivinityThese great Textuaries overlooked one Passage of holy Writ "To every Thing there is a Season"  Religion  is one Thing and the  Entertainment of innocent Cu∣riosity  anotherIf Clergymen take Care not to per∣mit  these Relaxations from severer Studies  to engross too much of their Time none but narrowminded Bigots will think the Investigation of antient Man∣ners an improper  Amusement  for them  The Spectator  There is another Passage in the Spectator where he intro∣duces the Girls in the Neighbourhood and his Landlady's Daugh∣ters telling Stories of Spirits and Apparitionshow they stood pale as Ashes at the Foot of a Bed and walked over Churchyards by Moon Lightof their being conjured to the Red Sea c He wittily observes  that one Spirit  raised  another and at the End of every Story the whole Company closed their Ranks and crowded about the Fire  accounting for the Rise and Progress of antient Superstition tells us our Forefathers looked upon Nature with more Reverence and Horror before the World was enlightened by Learning and Philosophy and loved to astonish themselves with the Apprehensions of Witchcraft Prodigies Charms and EnchantmentsThere was not a Village in England that had not a  Ghost  in itthe Churchyards were all  haunted  every Common had a Circle of  Fairies  belonging to it  and there was scarce a Shepherd to be met with who had not seen a  Spirit  Hence  Those Tales of vulgar Sprites  Which frighted Boys relate on Winter Nights  How

The Streets of this Northern Metropolis were formerly so vul∣gar Tradition has it haunted by a nightly  Guest  which appeared in the Shape of a Mastiff Dog c and terrified such as were afraid of Shadows This Word is a Corruption of the AngloSaxon gast spiritus animaI have heard when a Boy many Stories concern∣ing it  Parts The  Aftermidnight  and the  Dead of the Night  are the most solemn of them all and have therefore it should seem been appropriated by antient Superstition to the walking of Spirits  CHAP VII  Of Churchyards why the Vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at Night The Original of this Fear That there is nothing in them now more than in other Places to be afraid of  THE most of ignorant People are afraid of going through a  ChurchYard  at Nighttime If they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent Affair they fear and trem∣ble till they are beyond its Bounds but they generally avoid it and go further about It would no Question be better if there were fewer  Pathways  through ChurchYards than there are both as it would prevent several  Abuses  committed in them and also cause the Ashes of the Dead to be in greater Quiet and more undisturbed Peace We should not then see ChurchYards changed into common Dunghills nor should we tread so frequently upon the Bones of our Friends But when for the Conveniency of Neighbourhood or other Rea∣sons there are allowed public Ways it is a very great Weakness to be afraid of passing through them  The Reason of this Fear is a Notion they have imbib'd that in  ChurchYards  there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the  Deadtime  of Night Indeed there is at that Time some∣thing awful and horrible every where and it must be confess'd something more solemn in a  ChurchYard  than in the Generality of other Places but that it is then more frequented with  Apparitions and Ghosts  than other Places are is at this Time of Day intirely ground∣less and without any Reason  The Original of this Timorousness may be deduc'd from the Heathens For they believ∣ed that the  departed Ghosts  came out of their  Tombs  and  Sepulchres  and wander'd about the Place where the Body lay buried Thus  Maerin saepe animas imis excire sepulchris    VidiBucol    Virg  Virgil  tells us That  Maeris  could call the Ghosts out of their Sepulchres And  Nunc animae tenuesSepulchrisErrant  Ovid Fast  Ovid  that Ghosts came out of the Sepulchres and wandered about And  Clemens Alexandrinus  in his  Admonitions to the Gentiles  upbraids them with the Gods they worshipped which  Poos oun  c Admonit ad Gent P    says he are wont to appear at Tombs and Sepulchres and which are nothing but fading Spectres and airy Forms And the learned Mr  Mede  observes from a Passage of this same ancient Father  Mede Lib    P    de Cultu Daemon  That the Heathens supposed the Presence and Power of  Daemons  for so the  Greeks  called the Souls of Men  departed at their Coffins and Sepulchres as tho' there always remain'd some natural Tye between the Deceased and their Relicts  Agreeable to this Dr  Scot  Scot Christ Life P    Part    in his Discourse of the Christian Life speaks of  gross  and  sensual  Souls who appeared often after their Separation in  ChurchYards  or  Char∣nelHouses  where their Bodies were laid  The  Plat Phaed P    Soul that is infected with a great Lust to the Body continues so for a great while after Death and suffering many Reluctances ho∣vers about this visible Place and is hardly drawn from thence by Force by the  Daemon  that hath the Guard and Care of it  By the  visible Place  he means  P    ibid  their  Monuments and Sepulchres where the shadowy Fantasms  of such Souls  have sometimes appeared  It having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens that  Places of Burial and ChurchYards  were frequently haunted with  Spectres  and  Apparitions  it is easy to imagine that the Opinion has been handed from them among the Ignorant and unlearned through∣out all the Ages of Christianity to the present Day And indeed tho' now there may be no such Things yet that there have been need not be disputed not that they were the real Souls of Men departed For I cannot see for  what Reason it should be supposed    Scot Christ ibid  how∣ever unacquainted such Souls might be with the Pleasures of Spirits that they are permit∣ted to wander to hover about and linger after their Bodies  It seems rather to be true what is mentioned of such Apparitions in St  Athanasius  's Questions to  Antiochius  that  Athan Tom    P    these Apparitions of the Saints which appear at Tombs and Temples are not the Souls of the Saints themselves but the good Angels ap∣pearing in their Likeness And I imagine it must be so too with the Souls of bad Men they appear not themselves but they are re∣presented by the evil Angels For the Soul upon the Departure  returns to GOD that gave it  who allots it its Station in the World of Spirits where it is kept till the Day of Judgment in Happiness or Misery when it shall receive its Compleation of the one or the other However whatever these Apparitions were they are a certain Proof that such Ap∣pearances have been in such Places and in∣deed to add no more it is the whole Voice of Antiquity  But now with us GOD be thanked the Scene is changed we live not in the Darkness of Errour but in the Light of Truth we worship not  Daemons  but the GOD of the whole Earth and our Temples are not the Temples of Idols but the Temples of the Ho∣ly  GOD If among the Heathens such Delu∣sions were permitted it was because  GOD  had  forsaken them  But when he vouchsafes to have his Residence in his Holy Temple we are the further from Harm the nearer we approach it  Psal lxxxiv  There the Sparrow hath found her an House and the Swallow a Nest where she may lay her Young  and there shall no Harm happen to good Men but they shall be rather protected because they are so near their  Father  's  House  the House of Prayer  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER VII  WE learn from Moresin  Coemeteria hinc sunt Lycurgus omni superstitione sublata et ut  vanae superstitionis omnem evelleret è mentibus suorum formidi∣nem  inhumari  intra  Urbem et sepulchra extrui  circa Deorum Tem∣pla  c Deprav Rel Orig in verbo  Mr Strutt tells us that before the Time of Christianity it was held unlawful to bury the Dead  within  the Cities but they used to carry them out into the Fields hard by and there deposited them Towards the End of the sixth Century Augustine obtained of King Ethelbert a Temple of Idols where the King used to worship be∣fore his Conversion and made a  Burying place  of it but  St Cuthbert  afterwards obtained Leave to have  Yards  made to the Churches proper for the Reception of the Dead  AngloSaxon Aeta Vol I p  that Churchyards were used for the Purposes of Interment in order to remove SuperstitionBurial was in  antient Times  without  the Walls of Cities and Towns Lycurgus he tells us first introduced Gravestones  within  the Walls and as it were brought home the Ghosts to the very Doors Thus we compel Horses that are apt to startle to make the nearest possible Approaches to the Objects at which they have taken the Alarm  Our Author is certainly very right when he tells us that  Churchyards  are as little frequented by Apparitions and Ghosts as other Places and that therefore it is a Weakness to be afraid of passing through them Superstition however will always attend Ignorance and the Night as she continues to be the Mother of Dews will also never fail of being the fruitful Parent of chimerical Fears  Now it is the Time of Night  That the  Graves  all gaping wide  Ev'ry one lets forth his Sprite  In the  Churchway Path  to glide  Shakespear    When the Sun sets Shadows that shew'd

remain as he wished  in greater Quiet and more undisturbed Peace  CHAP VIII  Of visiting Wells and Fountains The Original of this Custom The naming of them of great An∣tiquity The Worship paid them by the Pa∣pists was gross Idolatry  IN the dark Ages of  Popery  it was a Custom if any  Well  had an awful Situation and was seated in some lonely melancholy Vale if its Water was clear and limpid and beauti∣fully  Viridi si margine clauderet undasHerba  Juven Sat    margin'd with the tender Grass or if it was look'd upon as having a Medicinal Quality to gift it to some  Saint  and honour it with his Name Hence it is that we have at this Day Wells and Fountains called some St  John  's St  Mary Magdalen  's St  Mary  's  Well  c  To these kind of Wells the common People are accustomed to go on a Summer's Evening to refresh themselves with a  Walk  after the Toil of the Day to drink the Water of the Fountain and enjoy the pleasing Prospect of Shade and Stream  Now this Custom tho' at this Time of Day very commendable and harmless and inno∣cent seems to be the Remains of that super∣stitious Practice of the Papists of paying  Adoration to Wells and Fountains For they imagin'd there was some Holiness and Sancti∣ty in them and so worshipped them In the  Canons  of St  Anselm  made in the Year we find this superstitious Practice in some Measure forbid  Johnson  Consti St  Anselm  Can  Let no one attribute Reverence or Sanctity to a dead Body or a Fountain or other Things as sometimes is to our Knowledge without the Bishop's Authority  And in the th of the  Canons  made in the Reign of King  Edgar  in the Year it is order'd  Johnson  Consti  That every Priest in∣dustriously advance Christianity and ex∣tinguish Heathenism and forbid the Wor∣shipping of Fountains c Mr  Johnson  says upon this  Canon  that the Worshipping of Wells and Fountains was a Superstition which prevailed in this Nation till the Age before the Reformation Nay I cannot say it is extinguish'd yet among the Papists In the Ages of dark Popery it was thought sufficient to forbid the honouring of Wells and Fountains without the Bishop's Appro∣bation  The giving of Names to Wells is of great Antiquity We find it a Custom in the Days of the old Patriarchs  Abraham  observed this Custom and therefore the Well which he  recover'd from the Servants of  Abimeleck  He  Gen xxi  called  Beersheba  or the Well of the Oath  because there they sware both of them  Thus also  Isaac  when his Herdsmen had found a Well and the Herdsmen of  Gerar  had a Con∣test with them about the Right of it  Ibid    called the Name of the Well  Eseck that is  Strife because they strove with him And he digged another Well and strove for that also and he called the Name of it  Sitnah that is  Hatred And he removed from thence and digged ano∣ther Well and for that they strove not and he called the Name of it  Rehoboth that is  Room And he said for now the LORD hath made Room for us and we shall be fruitful in the Land  And we read it was at  Jacob  's  Well  where JESUS talked with the Woman of  Sa∣maria  To give Names therefore to Wells is of an ancient Standing but to pay Homage and Worship to them was never heard of a∣mong the People of GOD till they sunk in∣to gross Idolatry and became Worshippers of Stocks and Stones  When the creature became worshipped instead of the Creator  then was this Custom first introduced in the Ages of Popish Ignorance and Idolatry  There need be no Question but as this Cus∣tom is practically Heathenish so it is also originally For the Heathens were wont to  worship Streams and Fountains and to sup∣pose that the Nymphs whom they imagin'd the Goddesses of the Waters presided over them As the Papists have borrowed many of their silly and superstitious Ceremonies from the Religion of the Heathens so this in par∣ticular a sottish stupid and abominable Custom they could borrow no where else  For we had no such Custom  neither at any Time  the Churches of GOD  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER VIII  I Find little that may be added to our Author's Account of the superstitious Adoration of  Wells  and  Fountains  There are Interdictions of this Super∣stition in the Laws of King  Canute  also preserved in Wheloc's Edition of Bede's Church History  Haedenscype bið {that} man peorþige oþþe flôdpaeter pyllas oþþe stanas c Leges  Canuti  Regis p  I have frequently observed Shreds or Bits of Rags upon the Bushes that overhang a  Well  in the Road to Benton a Village in the Neighbourhood of Newcastle It is called the  Rag Well  This Name is undoubtedly of a very long standing The Spring has been visited for some Disorder or other and these  Ragofferings  are the Reliques of the then prevailing popular SuperstitionThus Mr Pennant tells us they visit the Well of Spey in  Scotland for many Distempers and the Well of Drachaldy for as many offering small Pieces of Money and  Bits of Rags  The Custom of affixing  Ladles of Iron  c by a Chain to  Wells  is of great Antiquity Mr Strutt in his AngloSaxon Aera tells us that  Edwine  caused Ladles or Cups of Brass to be fastened to the clear  Springs  and  Wells  for the Refreshment of the Passen∣gers Venerable Bede is his AuthorityThis Custom is still re∣tained in many Places in the North  Pennant's Add p  Fitzstephen Monk of Canterbury in his Descrip∣tion of the antient City of London has these Words  There are on the North Part of London principal Fountains of Water sweet wholsome and clear streaming from among the glistering Pebble StonesIn this Number  Holy Well Clerken Well  and  St Clement's Well  are of most Note and frequented above the Rest when Scholars and the Youth of the City  take the Air  abroad in the  Summer Evenings  Mr Shaw in his History of the Province of Moray tells us that true rational christian Knowledge which was almost quite lost under Popery made very slow Progress after the Reformation that the prevailing Ignorance was attended with much Superstition and Credulity Heathenish and Romish Customs were much prac∣tised  Pilgrimages to Wells  and Chapels were frequent cWe had a remarkable  Well  of this Kind at Jesmond at the Distance of about a Mile from NewcastleOne of our principal Streets is said to have its name from an  Inn  that was in it to which the  Pilgrims  that flocked hither for the Benefit of the  supposed  holy Water used to resort    Stow p  A  Well  was a most valuable Treasure in those hot and dry Countries which composed the Scene of the Patriarchal History and therefore we find in  Genesis  that it was a frequent Subject of Contention  Fontinalia  in Roman Antiquity was a religious Feast ce∣lebrated on the th of October in Honour of the Nymphs of Wells and FountainsThe Ceremony consisted in throwing Nose∣gays into the  Fountains  and putting Crowns of Flowers upon the  Wells    CHAP IX  Of Omens Their Original The Observation of them sinfull  OMENS and Prognostications of Things are still in the Mouths of all though only observed by the Vulgar In Country Places especially they are in great Repute and are the Directors of several Actions of Life being looked on by them as Presages of Things future or the Determiners of present Good or Evil If  Lepus quoque occurrens in via infortunatum iter prae∣sagit ominosum  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    P    a Hare cross their Way it is an Omen of ill Luck If  Saepe sinistra cava praedixit ab ilice cornix  Virg Bucol    a Crow cry it por∣tends something Evil If  Maxime vero abominatus est bubo tristis dira avis voce funesta gemitu qui formidolosa dirasque necessitates magnos moles instare portendit  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    P    an Owl which they reckon a most abominable and unlucky Bird sends forth its hoarse and dismal Voice it is an Omen of the Approach of some terri∣ble Thing that some dire Calamity and some great Misfortune is near at Hand If Salt fall towards them to be sure something has hap∣pened to one in the Family or is shortly to happen to themselves Such also is the Chat∣tering  of a Magpye the Cry of Ravens the Deadwatch Crickets  c  This is a Copy of the Omens of the Hea∣thens  Deinde anguribus reliqui reges usi Et exactis regibus nihil publice sine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gerabatur  Cic de Divin Lib    who never went upon any Enter∣prize nor undertook any Business of Moment without consulting the Augurs and WiseMen and being guided by Omens and Presages of Things Hence it was that they consulted the Intrails of Beasts the Flights of Birds and several other Things And that the very Things abovementioned as the Authorities there declare have been observed by them yea they have observ'd them even in the re∣motest Ages beyond the Days of the oldest Records The Heathen World therefore was full of them and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from these Times  And as it is not to be question'd but we had them from the Heathens so in all Proba∣bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD and built many of their Folies and ominous Superstitions on a Custom which they alone were indulged in For in the ear∣liest Age of the World when a Matter of any great Consequence was depending and the Servants of GOD would know what the Event would be they asked a  Sign  of GOD by de∣siring  that such a Thing might happen if they were to succeed and God was sometimes so condescending as to grant them their De∣sire Thus we read That  Sam i iii  Jonathan  accom∣pany'd only by his Armour Bearer not fear∣ing the Steepness of the Rocks nor Multitudes of Enemies attempted the Garrison of the  Philistines  and conquered through a Token of this Nature  If they say  says he to his ArmourBearer  Tarry untill we come up then we will stand still in our Place and will not go up unto them but if they say come up unto us then we will go up for the LORD hath deli∣vered them into our Hands and this shall be a Sign unto us  And so indeed it came to pass GOD who had inspired  Jonathan  with this Thought directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wishes In like Manner when the good old Servant of  Abraham  had arrived at the City of  Nahor  to find a Wife for his Master's Son we have him desiring of GOD that the Sign of the Woman he should pitch upon might be her saying  Drink and I will give thy Camels Drink also  Gen xxiv  Ana he said O Lord GOD of my Master  Abraham  I pray thee send me good Speed this Day and shew Kindness unto my Master  Abraham  Behold I stand here by the Well of Water and the Daughters of the  Men of the City came out to draw Water And let it come to pass that the Damsel to whom I shall say let down thy Pitcher I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say Drink and I will give thy Camels Drink also Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy Servant  Isaac  and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed Kindness unto my Master  This happened ac∣cording to his Prayer by which he knew that the LORD had prospered his Journey Now this Custom we know the  Philistines  imitated when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of  Israel  for keep∣ing the Ark  Sam i  They took the Ark of the LORD and laid it on a Cart and sent it away And they said If it goeth by the Way of his own Coast to  Bethshemoth  then he hath done us this great Evil  In these early Ages of the World GOD per∣mitted such Things upon extraordinary Occa∣sions to be asked by his own People But they were only peculiar to those Times We have no Warrant for doing the like It be∣comes not us to prescribe Means to GOD by which we may judge of our future Success but to depend on his Power and Wisdom his Care and Providence The Observation of Omens such as the falling of Salt a Hare  crossing the Way of the DeadWatch of Cric∣kets  c  are sinful and diabolical They are the Inventions of the Devil to draw Men from a due Trust in GOD and make them his own Vassals For by such Observations as these they are the Slaves of Superstition and Sin and have all the While no true Dependance upon GOD no Trust in his Providence  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER IX  VArious are the popular Superstitions with re∣gard to  Omens  To these our Author has hinted at many more may be added  The breaking a  Looking Glass  is accounted a very unlucky Accident  Mirrors  were formerly used by Magicians in their superstitious and diabolical Ope∣rations and there was an antient Kind of Divina∣tion by the  Looking Glass  See the Greek  Scholia  on the  Nubes  of Aristophanes p  Hence it should seem the present popular Notion  When our

SpringThe Rhodians are said to have had a solemn anniversary Song to welcome in the Swallow See Anacreon's Ode to that Bird  I think it is Mr Addison that supposes the popu∣lar Ballad of the  Babes in

made Use of the  Hare  for the Purposes of Divination They were never killed for the Table 'Tis per∣haps from hence that they have been accounted  ominous  by the Vulgar Caesar p  the  Crow  the  Pye

may add to Mr Pennant's Account the strange Qualification many of the Inhabitants of the western Islands of Scotland are said to have called  Second Sight  It is a Faculty of seeing Things to come or

had their  Omens  too they felt  strange Kisses on their Lips  they saw  Rings in the Candle Purses  bounded  from the Fire  and  True Love Knots  lurked at the Bottom of every  Tea Cup  In the North the  Cinders  that  bound from the Fire  in this Manner are examined by old Women Chi  dren c and according to their respective Forms are called either  Coffins  or  Purses  and consequently  thought to be  the Presages of  Death  or  Wealth  Aut Caesar aut Nullus    In  hectic  and  consumptive  Diseases they  pare  the  Nails  of the  Fingers  and  Toes  of the  Patient  put these  Parings  into a  Rag  cut from his Clothes then  wave  their  Hand  with the  Rag thrice  round his Head crying  Deas Soil  after which they  bury  the  Rag  in some  unknown  Place He tells us he has seen this done and Pliny in his Natural History mentions it as practised by the  Magicians  or  Druids  of his Time  When a contagious  Disease  enters among  Cattle  the  Fire  is  extinguished  in some Villages round then they  force Fire  with a  Wheel  or by  rubbing  a Piece of  dry Wood  upon another and therewith  burn Juniper  in the  Stalls  of the  Cattle  that the  Smoke  may  purify  the  Air  about them They like∣wise boil  Juniper  in  Water  which they  sprinkle  upon the  Cattle  this done the  Fires  in the  Houses  are  rekindled  from the  forced Fire  All this too he tells us he has seen done and has no Doubt of its being a  Druid Custom  Mr Shaw further tells us that the antient Scots much regarded  Omens  upon an Expedition An  armed Man meeting  them was a  good  OmenIf a  Woman barefoot crossed  the  Road  before them they seized her and  fetched Blood  from her  Fore∣head  If a  Deer Fox Hare  or any Beast of Game appeared and they did not kill it it was an  unlucky  Omen  Spitting  according to Pliny was superstitiously observed in  averting Witchcraft  and in  giving  a  shrewder Blow  to an Enemy Hence seems to be derived the Custom our  Bruisers  have of  spit∣ting  in their  Hands  before they begin their unmanly Barbarity Several other Vestiges of this Superstition relative to  fasting Spittle  Fascinationes  saliva jejuna  repelli veteri

CHAP X  Of the Country Conversation in a Winter's Even∣ing Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions of the Devil's appearing with a cloven Foot of Fairies and Hobgoblins of the walking Places of Spirits and of haunted Houses  NOthing is commoner in  Country Places  than for a whole Family in a  Winter's Evening  to sit round the Fire and tell Stories of Apparitions and Ghosts And no Question of it but this adds to the natural Fearfulness of Men and makes them many Times ima∣gine they see Things which really are no∣thing but their own Fancy From this and seldom any other Cause it is that  Herds  and  Shepherds  have all of them seen  frequent Ap∣paritions  and are generally so well stock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge Some of them have seen  Fairies  some  Spirits  in the Shapes of  Cows  and  Dogs  and  Horses  and some have seen even the  Devil  himself with a  cloven Foot  All which is either  Hearsay  or a  strong Imagination  Not that there have not been or may not be Apparitions we know that there have undoubtedly been such Things and that there still are upon parti∣lar Occasions but that almost all the Stories of Ghosts and Spirits are grounded on no  other Bottom than the Fears and Fancies and weak Brains of Men  In their Account of the Apparition of the Devil they always describe him with a  cloven Foot  That is always his distinguishing Badge whatever Shape he appears in whe∣ther it be in Beauty or Deformity he never appears without it Such is the old Tradi∣tion they have received of his appearing and such is their Belief of it  Indeed it must be confess'd that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold For tho' perhaps few of them have ought else for this Opinion but  old Wives Fables  or the Picture of the Devil which they have always observed drawn with a cloven Foot yet there seems to be some Truth in it For in the Times of frequent Apparitions the Devil was wont to appear so if we may believe Antiquity and there is also some Reason for it considering the Cir∣cumstances of the fallen Angels  The  Brown's Vulg Err  Author of the  Vulgar Errors  upon this same Subject hath these Words  The Ground of this Opinion at first might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat which answers this Description This was the Opinion of the ancient Chri∣stians  concerning the Apparitions of  Pa∣nites Fauns  and  Satyrs  and of this Form we read of one that appeared to  Anthony  in the Wilderness The same is also confirmed from Expositions of Holy Scripture For whereas it is said  Thou shalt not offer unto Devils  The original Word is  Seghnirim  that is  rough and hairy Goats  because in that Shape the Devil most often appeared as is expounded by the  Rabbins  as  Tremellius  hath also explain'd and as the Word  Asci∣mah  the God of  Emath  is by some conceived He observes also That the  Goat  was the Emblem of the  Sin Offering  and is the Em∣blem of Sinful Men at the Day of Judg∣ment  And of this Opinion was also the learned Mr  Mede Dis  Mede  He says  That when Spirits converse with Men it is under some visible Shape and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they assum'd should be of something which more or less resembled their Condition For as in Nature we see every Thing hath a several and suitable  Physiog∣nomy  or  Figure  as a Badge of their inward Nature whereby it is known as by a Habit of Distinction so it seems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits And as in a well governed Common Wealth  every Sort and Condition is known by a dif∣fering Habit agreeable to his Quality so it seems it should be in GOD'S great Common Wealth concerning the Shapes which Spi∣rits take upon them And he that gave the Law that a Man should not wear the Habit of a Woman nor a Woman the Ha∣bit of a Man because that as he had made them diverse so would he have them so known by their Habits so it seems he will not suffer a good and a bad Spirit a noble and ignoble one to appear unto Man after the same Fashion  Now from this it will follow that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape but the Shape of Man because their glori∣ous Excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible Creatures The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un∣suitable no other Shape becoming those who are called  the Sons of GOD  but his only who  was created after GOD's own Image  And yet not his neither as he now is but according as he was before his Fall in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin and the Angel in the Gospel appears like a young Man  His  Matth xxviii  Countenance like Light∣ning and his Raiment white as Snow  as it  were resembling the Beauty of glorified Bodies in Immutability Sublimity and Purity  Hence also it follows on the contrary that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilst Man was in his Integrity be∣cause he was a Spirit fallen from his first glorious Perfection and therefore must ap∣pear in such Shape which might argue his Imperfection and Abasement which was the Shape of a Beast Otherwise no Reason can be given why he should not rather have appeared to  Eve  in the Shape of a Woman than of a Serpent for so he might have gain'd an Opinion with her both of more Excellency and Knowledge But since the Fall of Man the Case is al∣ter'd now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man and no Wonder since one falling Star may resemble another And therefore he appears it seems in the Shape of Man's Imperfection either for Age or Deformity as like an old Man for so the Witches say And perhaps it is not altogether false which is vulgarly affirmed that the Devil appearing in humane Shape hath always a Deformity of some uncouth Member or other as tho' he could not yet take upon him humane Shape intirely for that Man himself is not intirely and ut∣terly fallen as he is  Thus far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter and that with such Strength of Reason and Argument as leaves at least a Probability behind it of the Truth of this Opinion  Another Part of this Conversation generally turns upon  Fairies  These they tell you have frequently been heard and seen nay that there are some still living who were stolen away by them and confined seven Years According to the Description they give of them who pretend to have seen them they are in the Shape of Men exceeding little They are always clad in Green and frequent the Woods and Fields when they make Cakes which is a Work they have been often heard at they are very noisy and when they have done they are full of Mirth and Pastime But generally they dance in  MoonLight  when Mor∣tals are asleep and not capable of seeing them as may be observed on the following Morn their dancing Places being very distinguish∣able For as they dance Hand in Hand and so make a  Circle  in their Dance so next Day there will be seen  Rings  and  Circles  on the Grass  Now in all this there is really nothing but an old fabulous Story which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of  Heathenism  of a certain Sort of Beings called  Lamiae  which were esteemed so mischievous and cruel as to take away young Children and slay them These together with the  the Fauns  the  Gods of the Woods  seem to have formed the Notion of Fairies  This Opinion in the benighted Ages of Popery when  Hobgoblins  and  Sprights  were in every  City  and  Town  and  Village  by every  Water  and in every  Wood  was very common But when that Cloud was dispell'd and the Day sprung up those Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error did real∣ly vanish at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge  Another Tradition they hold and which is often talk'd of is that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in Thence it was that formerly such frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit and that the com∣mon People say now and then such a Place is dangerous to be pass'd through at Night be∣cause a Spirit walks there Nay they'll fur∣ther tell you that some Spirits have lamented the Hardness of their Condition in being ob∣liged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Pla∣ces and have therefore desired the Person who was so hardy as to speak to them to gift them with a warmer Walk by some well grown  Hedge  or in some  shady Vale  where they might be shelter'd from the Rain and Wind  The Stories that Apparitions have been seen oftner than once in the same Place have no Doubt been the Rise and Spring of the walking Places of Spirits but why they are said sometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable is not so certainly known It is however highly probable that when the Ignorance and Superstition of the  Romish  Church had filled the World with  Apparitions  and  Ghosts  that this also was invented among them For they seem to have the most  Right  to an Invention of this Nature whose Brains were so fruitful of Folly as to invent that  Fuller's Ch Hist Cen  Dunstan  took the Devil by the Nose with a Pair of hot  Tongs  till he roar'd again For if the Devil may be burnt he may also be starv'd if he took such Pains to get his Nose out of the  Pincers  without Doubt in a frosty Night he would wish to be as warm as possi∣ble He that believes the one must necessarily believe the other And therefore it very near amounts to a Demonstration who were the Authors of this Opinion  viz  The  Monks  We are sure they invented the one and need little question but they invented the other  There is a Story in the Book of  Tobit  which they may believe that will of the  evil Spirits  flying into the utmost Parts of  Egypt  Tob vi  For as  Tobias  went in unto his Wife he remembred the Words of  Raphael  and took the Ashes of the Perfumes and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish thereupon and made a Smoke therewith The which Smell when the evil Spirit had smelled he fled unto the utmost Parts of  Egypt  and the Angel bound him  Now from this it is evident that the Spirit was obliged to forsake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings for inhospitable Desarts and open Air And from this perhaps some of those  doting Monks  have persuaded themselves into a Belief of these Things  When it is proved to us that this Book of  Tobit  is the Word of GOD we may entertain more Veneration for this vulgar Opinion but till then we must be indulg'd in wondering how a Spirit that is an  immaterial Substance  can be affected with our Heat or Cold or any Power or Quality of  material Beings  The last Topick of this Conversation I shall take Notice of shall be the Tales of  haunted  Houses And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at that this is never omitted For formerly almost every Place had a House of this Kind If a House was seated on some melancholly Place or built in some old romantic Manner or if any particular Accident had happen'd in  it such as Murder sudden Death or the like to be sure that House had a Mark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the Habitation of a Ghost In talking upon this Point they generally show the Occasion of the House's be∣ing  haunted  the merry Pranks of the Spirit and how it was laid Stories of this Kind are infinite and there are few  Villages  which have not either had such an House in it or near it  And indeed there are Men of good Learn∣ing and Knowledge who are as far as others from Superstition who are inclinable to be∣lieve that such Things have been upon parti∣cular Emergencies tho' among the Stories that are told they believe not one in a thou∣sand They know that Spirits have frequent∣ly appeared to Men out of Houses and they can see no Reason why they may not have ap∣peared in them They know nothing in an House more than in another Place to prevent an Apparition but an equal Help to its Visi∣bility The Air which a Ghost is supposed to be wrapped in when it becomes visible to Men is there to be found and they know of nothing else that may be an Argument against it An Author of good Credit tells us  Cum  Romae  aegra valetudine oppressus forem jaceremque in lectulo speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigi∣lanti observatam fuisse quam cum inspicerem diu cogita∣bundus cCum meos sensus vigere figuram illam nusquam a me dilabi c  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    That  when he was at  Rome  he was taken with Ill∣ness and obliged to keep his Bed As he lay in this Condition he observed as he was once awake a  Woman  of a very beautiful Person coming towards him Upon this he was silent for some Time and very thoughtful weigh∣ing all the while with himself whether it was not rather a  deceptio visus  than a real Being But when he perceived his Senses sound and intire and that the Object still continued he asked What she was In Answer to which she repeated the very Words he had spoken to her in a sneering and disdainful Manner After she had taken a good View of him she departed  The Commentator upon this Place says  Sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi  ibid  He looks upon this Story and the rest which are mentioned along with it to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies And for ought that I know to the contrary they may be so but however it must be confess'd this Story in particular is well attested being told by the Man himself who was a great and a learned Man and who if we may believe himself seems to be as sure that he had his Eyes open as the Commentator can be of the contrary  But whatever Truth there may be in it it is certain that in the Church of  Rome  they are persuaded of the Truth of it to a Fault  For they are so sure of it that they have par∣ticular Forms of  exorcising  such Houses which because they have often been heard of but seldom seen and are those very Things which raised in the Vulgar formerly such an Opinion of their ignorant Priests as to make them be esteemed Men of the greatest Faith and Learning and because also the Opinion has reached even our Days and 'tis common for the present Vulgar to say none can lay a Spirit but a  Popish Priest  it shall be the Business of the next Chapter to give one of those Forms of  exorcising  an House not that they are envied for their Art of  conjuring  but that it may be seen how well they deserve the Character they go under  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER X  OF such a WinterEvening's Confabulation as our Author speaks of  Dr Akenside  the Boast of our  Newcastle  Dr Akenside  was born at  Newcastle upon Tyne  and received the first Principles of his Education at the very respectable  Gram∣mar School  there his Father a reputable  Butcher  of the Town A Halt in his Gai  ▪ occasioned when a Boy by the falling of a  Cleaver  from his  Father's Stall  must have been a perpetual Remem∣brancer of his humble Origin I mention this because from the Biographical Account of him prefixed to the posthumous Edition of his Works an  Outline  with which he himself must have fur∣nished his Friends one is inclined to believe that he was  ashamed  of his  Birth  We regret on perusing it the Omission of those pleasing and interesting little  Anecdotes  usually given of the  first Indications  of  Genius  His Townsmen have many other Reasons that lead to the Confirmation of this SuspicionTaking this for granted it was a great and unpardonable Foible in one of so ex∣alted an Understanding  False Shame  was perhaps never more strongly exemplified The learned World will forgive me for at∣tempting in this Note to  defeat  his very  narrow Purpose  for I can call by no softer Name the wishing to conceal from Posterity a Circumstance that would by no means have lessened his Fame with them I flatter myself it is compatible with the Respect we owe to the  Dead  and even to the Memory of  him  who on other Accounts  deserved  so  highly  of his Country  The Distinction of  Family  is honourable It is the  transmitted Inheritance  of  great Deserts  But let it be remembered that  Selfcreation  by personal Merit is the  pure Fountain  of which  that  is too often no more than the  polluted Stream Accidents  must al∣ways be light when put in the Scales

told that the utmost Kings can do is to  confer  itles  they cannot make Men  deserve  them  The Propriety of this Reasoning can only be felt by philoso∣phical Spirits The World  wisely on its own Account  repro∣bates such Doctrine Yet while others are boasting with the Roman Governor of old  that with large Sums  they  obtained this Freedom  let those in the same Predicament with our Poet

Fairies  It was supposed that from their hard Labour and mean Employment they became of a swarthy or tawny Colour whence their Name of  Brownies  Dr Johnson in his Journey to the western Islands

Highlands of Scotland and Children are  watched till the Christening is over  lest they should be  stolen  or  changed  Tour in Scotland p    Perhaps Mr Bourne's Account of the Origin of  Fairies  may be controverted They are rather of  Eastern  than of  Roman  Extraction and are said to have been invented by the Persians and Arabs whose Religion and History abound with Relations concerning them They have assigned them a pe∣culiar Country to inhabit and call it  Fairy Land  A respectable  old Woman  of our Nation Mr Lilly in  his Life and Times  tells us  Fairies  love the  southern Side  of

and especially the common People could not every where have been so unanimously agreed concern∣ing these arbitrary Notions if they had not prevailed among them for many Ages Indeed he farther observes a learned Friend in Wales assures the Editor that the Existence of  Fairies  and  Goblins  is alluded to by the most antient  British Bards  who mention them under various Names one of the most common

Angels always do thee Service in Hea∣ven so they may succour and defend us on Earth through CHRIST our LORD And be thou also mercifully present that as  Solo∣mon  began to build a House for the Use of thy Majesty on Mount  Moria  the Place which was shewn to his Father  David  so by the Operation of thy holy Angels this House may be freed from the evil Spirit and be a quiet Habitation for Men By the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST  c  The Office on  Wednesday  ON  Wednesday  all Things which are order∣ed for  Munday  and  Tuesday  being observed in the same Manner except the Versicles of the Prayer and the Prayer for  Tuesday  He shall stand in the Entry of the House and say  The LESSON  From the History of  Bel  and the  Dragon Verse    AND the King went with  Daniel  into the Temple of  Bel  so  Bel  's Priests said  Lo we go out But thou O King set on the Meat and make ready the Wine and shut the Door fast and seal it with thine own Sig∣net And to Morrow when thou comest in if thou findest not that  Bel  hath eaten up all we will suffer Death or else  Daniel  that speak∣eth against us And they little regarded it For under the Table they had made a privy Entrance whereby they entred in continual∣ly and consumed those Things So when they were gone forth the King set Meats be∣fore  Bel  Now  Daniel  had commanded his Servants to bring Ashes and those they strew∣ed throughout all the Temple in the Pre∣sence of the King alone Then went they out and shut the Door and sealed it with the King's Signet and so departed Now in the Night came the Priests with their Wives and Children as they were wont to do and did eat and drink up all In the Morning betime the King arose and  Daniel  with him And the King said  Daniel  are the Seals whole And  Daniel  said Yea O King they be whole And assoon as he had open'd the Door the King looked upon the Table and cried with a loud Voice Great art thou O  Bel  and with thee there is no Deceit at all Then  Daniel  laughed and told the King that he should not go in and said Behold now the Pavement and mark well whose Footsteps  are these And the King said I see the Foot∣steps of Men Women and Children And then the King was angry and took the Priests with their Wives and Children who shewed him the privy Doors where they came in and consumed such Things as were upon the Table Therefore the King slew them and delivered  Bel  into  Daniel  's Power who de∣stroyed him and his Temple  V  Blessed are they that dwell in thy House  R  They will be always praising thee  The PRAYER  O GOD by whose right Hand the holy  Peter  was lifted up that he perished not in the Waters and his Fellow Apostle  Paul  was thrice delivered from Shipwrack and the Depth of the Sea mercifully hear us and grant that by both their Merits we may ob∣tain thy eternal Glory who livest and reign∣est with GOD the Father in the Unity of the Holy Spirit GOD for ever and ever And we beseech thee mercifully to look upon this House which we know to be infested with the Devil that as in  Jerusalem  when the Temple was finished and  Solomon  had ended his Pray∣er thy Glory filled thy House before the Children of  Israel  so grant that this House may be cleansed before us by our Ministry  and that thou wouldest appear in it and in us in Glory By thee the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST who with the same Father and Holy Spirit livest and reignest for ever  Amen  The Office on  Thursday  ON  Thursday  when those Things are re∣tain'd which are to be retain'd as may be seen on  Munday Tuesday  and  Wednesday  and also the Versicles and the Prayer of  Wednesday  omitted he shall visit the middle Part of the House and say  The LESSON  Job  Chap  xl  THE LORD said unto  Job  Behold how  Behemoth  which I made with thee he eateth Grass as an Ox Lo now his Strength is in his Loyns and his Force is in the Navel of his Belly He moveth his Tail like a Cedar the Sinews of his Stones are wrapt together His Bones are as strong as Pieces of Brass his Bones are like Bars of Iron He is the Chief of the Ways of GOD He that made him can make his Sword to ap∣proach with him Surely the Mountains bring him forth Food where all the Beasts of the Field play He lieth under the shady Trees  in the Covert of the Reed and Fens The shady Trees cover him with their Shadow the Willows of the Brook compass him about Behold he drinketh up a River and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up  Jordan  into his Mouth He taketh it with his Eyes His Nose pierceth through Snares  Job xli  Canst thou draw out  Leviathan  with a Hook Or his Tongue with a Cord which thou lettest down Canst thou put a Hook in his Nose Or bore his Jaw through with a Thorn Will he make any Supplications unto thee Will he speak soft Words unto thee Will he make a Covenant with thee Wilt thou take him for a Servant for ever Wilt thou play with him as with a Bird Or wilt thou bind him for thy Maidens Shall the Companion make a Banquet for him Or shall they part among the Merchants Canst thou fill his skin with barbed Irons Or his Head with Fish Spears Lay thine Hand upon him remember the Battle no more Behold the Hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the Sight of him  V  LORD I have loved the Glory of thy House  R  And the Place where thine Honour dwel∣leth  The PRAYER  Collect for  Whitsunday  O GOD who didst teach the Hearts of thy faithful People by the sending to them the light of thy Holy Spirit grant us by the same Spirit to have a right Judg∣ment in all Things and evermore to rejoyce in his holy Comfort through CHRIST our LORD And grant unto us thy Servants that as thy House whilst thou sittest in thy Lofty Throne is replenished with the Odour of thy Glory so by thy Assistance this House may be filled with thy Grace to repel all the Works of the Devil By the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who liveth and reigneth with thee in the Unity of the same Holy Spirit GOD throughout all Ages  Amen  The Office on  Friday  ON  Friday  having observ'd all those Things which are used on  Munday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  and omitted others as is there shewn together with the Versicles of the Prayer and the Prayer as on other Days let him go up and down the whole House and say  The LESSON S  Luke iv  AND he arose out of the Synagogue and entred into  Simon  's House and  Simon  's Wife's Mother was taken with a great Fever And they besought him for her And he stood over her and rebuked the Fever and it left her And immediately she arose and mini∣stred unto them Now when the Sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers Diseases brought them unto him And he laid his Hands on every one of them and healed them And Devils also came out of many crying out and saying Thou art CHRIST the Son of GOD And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak For they knew that he was CHRIST  V  I would rather be a Door Keeper in the House of my GOD  R  Then to dwell in the Tents of Ungod∣liness  The PRAYER  O GOD who by the precious Blood of thy dear Son hast been pleased to sanctifie the Ensign of the enlivening Cross grant we beseech thee that thou wouldst be pleased to protect him who is pleased with honouring thy Holy Cross By the same CHRIST our  LORD And we beseech thee to grant that thou wouldst be present in this House in the same merciful Manner to overturn the Frauds of the Devil as thou wast mercifully present with King  Solomon  in the House which he built thee By the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who livest and reignest with thee in Unity of the Holy Ghost GOD for ever and ever  Amen  The Office on  Saturday  ON the  Sabbath  all Things being done which are order'd on  Munday Tuesday Wed∣nesday Thursday  and  Friday  and other Things omitted as is shewn by Notes in those Places together with the Versicles of the Prayer and the Prayer itself let him search through the whole House and say  The LESSON S  Mark iii  AND unclean Spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying Thou art the Son of GOD And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known And he goeth up into a Mountain and calleth unto him whom he would And they came unto him And he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he  might send them forth to preach and to have Power to heal Sicknesses and to cast out De∣vils  V  The Sparrow hath found her an House  R  And the Turtle a Nest where she may lay her Young  The PRAYER  GRANT O LORD GOD unto us thy Ser∣vants that we may enjoy perpetual Peace of Mind and Soundness of Body and by the Intercession of the glorious and blessed  Mary  always a Virgin be delivered from our present Sorrow and obtain thy everlasting Joy through JESUS CHRIST our LORD And be thou so present with us thy humble Ser∣vants that as when the Priests came out of the Tabernacle the Cloud of thy Glory filled thy whole House so let thy Grace illuminate this House to us that go into it that it may be delivered from the Workings of the Devil and be a Dwelling for Men replenish'd with all Benediction through the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who livest and reignest with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit God World without End  Amen  The Office on  Sunday  ON  Sunday  after the Priest has placed him∣self in one of the largest and most sumptuous Parts of the House he shall direct this Exorcism to the Demons that haunt it saying  I Exorcise you O ye Demons who have thus boldly presum'd to invade this Ha∣bitation of Men and give such Disquietude to its Inhabitants by the Triune GOD  whose is the Earth and the fulness thereof the round World and they that dwell therein  by our LORD JESUS CHRIST who continuing what he was made himself Man conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of a Virgin and who for our Sakes when he had undergone many Sufferings underwent also the Torment of the cruel Cross upon which he bowed his Head and gave up the Ghost that he might obtain for us abundant Grace in the present Life and in the World to come Life everlasting By all the Grace acquir'd for us by the Grace of Faith conferr'd in Baptism of Fortitude in Con∣firmation of Charity in the Eucharist of Ju∣stice in Pennance of Hope in extream Unction of Temperance in Matrimony and of Prudence in holy Orders and by all holy Men and Wo∣men the Saints of GOD who now inherit eternal Glory and by all their Merits that  you remove this your presumptuous Power from this House and continue here no longer nor any more vex its Inhabitants  Then let him exorcise the whole House by saying  I Exorcise this House which was built for the Use of humane Kind by the Father Son and Holy Ghost the omnipotent GOD who built the House of the whole World for Man and put all Things in it in Subjection under his Feet and by CHRIST our LORD who is the Fountain of all Grace and the Origin of all Virtue by his unparallel'd Poverty of which he truely said  The Foxes have Holes and the Birds of the Air have Nests but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head  By his Meek∣ness he himself saying of it  Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in Heart  By his Weeping when he beheld  the City  Jerusalem  and wept over it  saying  If thou hadst known  By the Hunger and Thirst of his Righteousness say∣ing  My Meat is to do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven  By his Mercy which excited him to say  I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice  By his Purity of Heart of which he could say  Be ye holy for I am holy  By the Peace which he always loved as at the last he shewed when he said  Peace I leave with you my Peace I give unto you  And by that Persecution which he suffer'd for Righteousness Sake  which he himself attests saying  If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you  And by the Holy Apostles and by the Effusion of their Blood and by all holy Men and holy Women that thou mayest be blessed and obtain from GOD above such Virtue by our Ministry that thou mayst become to the evil Spirits a new Hell and a burning Fur∣nace of eternal Horror so that they may flee from every Corner and leave thee intirely free that thou mayst become a comfortable Habitation for Men and that GOD may ever be glorified  After that let him bless the House in the follow∣ing Manner  V  O LORD hear my Prayer  R  And let my Cry come unto thee  V  He hath bless'd the House of  Israel  R  He hath bless'd the House of  Aaron  Mac B C  THOU O LORD of all Things who hast Need of nothing wast pleased that the Temple of thine Habitation should be among us and therefore now O Holy LORD of all Holiness keep this House ever undefi∣led which lately was cleansed And grant unto us the Abundance of thy Goodness that this House may be blessed † and sanctified of  thee † by our Ministry that the evil Angels may abdicate it and it may be a Protection for the Faithful a pure Habitation for the Holy Angels and a Possession always worthy of thy Care through our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who liveth and reigneth with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit GOD who shall come to judge the Quick and Dead and the World by Fire  Amen  Then let the Image of our SAVIOUR upon the Cross he erected in an open Part of the prin∣cipal Room in the House and let the Priest sprinkle the whole House with holy Water from Top even to the Bottom saying  The LESSON St  Luke  Chap  xix  AND JESUS entred and passed through  Je∣richo  And behold there was a Man na∣med  Zaccheus  which was the Chief among the Publicanes and he was rich and he sought to see JESUS who he was and he could not for the Press because he was little of Stature And he ran before and climbed up into a Sy∣comore Tree to see him for he was to pass that Way And when JESUS came to the Place he looked up and saw him and said unto him  Zaccheus  make haste and come down for to Day I must abide at thy House And he made haste and came down and received  him joyfully And when they saw it they all murmured saying That he was gone to be a Guest with a Man that is a Sinner And  Zac∣cheus  stood and said unto the LORD Behold LORD the Half of my Goods I give to the Poor And if I have taken any Thing of any Man by false Accusation I restore him four∣fold And JESUS said unto him This Day is Salvation come to this House forasmuch as he also is the Son of  Abraham  For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  When all these Things are done let  Abyssum  which is a Kind of an Herb be procur'd and after it is sign'd with the Sign of the Cross let it be hung up at the four Corners of the House  I suppose the Reason of proceeding after this Manner Day by Day is that the Devil may be gradually banished And to be sure what is observed on the last of the Days  viz  The or∣dering of the  Crucifix  the  holy Water  the  Abys∣sum  tyed to the four Corners of the House is to keep the Devil out when he is out  St  Austin  tells us a Story of one  Vir  Hesperitius  Ubi Domum suam spirituum maiignorum vim noxiam perpeti comperisset roga∣vit nostros me absente Presbyteros ut aliquis eorum illo pergeret cujus orationibus cederent perrexit unus obtulit ibi sacrificium corporis Christi orans quantum potuit ut ces∣saret illa vexatio Deo protinus miserante cessarit  Aug de Civit Dei Lib    Cap    Hesperi∣tius  whose House was troubled with evil Spi∣rits  who came once in his Absence to his Presbyters and begg'd their Assistance Upon which one of them went along with him and when he had offer'd the Sacrifice of the Body of CHRIST and prayed in a most fervent Manner the House by the Mercy of GOD was no longer troubled  Here is indeed an Account of a House be∣ing haunted but not a Word of any such Or∣der in the dispossessing it The Priest goes im∣mediately over the Threshold into the troubled Apartment and expells the Spirits by his Pray∣ers Had such Forms been customary in the Days of St  Austin  had the  Crucifix holy Wa∣ter  and  Abyssum  been used no Question but here or somewhere else we should have had some Account of it But these Ages were unac∣quainted with such whimsical Forms of exorci∣sing and if the Story be true it was nothing but Prayer that quieted the House 'Tis ridi∣culous to suppose that the  Prince of Darkness  will yield to such feeble Instruments as  Water  and  Herbs  and  Crucifixes These Weapons are not spiritual but carnal  Whereas in resisting this potent Enemy  we must put on the whole Armour of GOD that we may be able to resist  him  Which is such a Composition as is in∣tirely free from the least Allay or Mixture of any such Superstitions  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XI  I Find little that may be added concerning the  exorcising haunted Houses  a Species of the  Black Art  which is now almost forgotten in this King∣dom Perhaps the  Form  is worth preserving as a Curiosity as we hang up rusty Pieces of old Armour A Proof how much ado there may have been about  nothing  and yet it may be supposed not altogether for  nothing  either  St Chrysostom is said to have insulted some African  Conjurers  of old with this humiliating and singular Observation  Miserable and woeful Crea∣tures that we are we cannot so much as  expel Fleas  much less  Devils  Obsession  of the Devil is distinguished from  Possession  in this In  Possession  the  Evil One  was said to enter into the  Body  of the ManIn  Obsession  without  entering into  the Body of the Person  he  was thought to besiege and torment him  without  to be  lifted up  into the  Air  and afterwards to be  thrown down  on the Ground violently  without  receiving any  Hurt  to  speak strange Lan∣guages  that the Person had  never learn'd  not to be  able  to  come near holy Things  or the  Sacraments  but to  have  an  Aversion  to themto  know  and  foretell secret Things  to  perform Things  that  exceed  the Person's  Strength  to  say  or  do  Things that the Person  would not  or  durst not  say if he were not  externally  moved to it were the antient Marks and Criterions of  Obsession  Calmet in Bailey's Dict  The old vulgar Ceremonies used in  raising  the  Devil  such as making a  Circle  with  Chalk  setting an old  Hat  in the  Center  of it repeating the  Lord's Prayer backwards  c c are now altoge∣ther obsolete and seem to be forgotten even amongst our boys None will desire to see them  revived  amongst them yet it were to be wished that many of these little Gentry had not substituted the doing Things  really bad  for this  seemingly profane  but truly ridi∣culous Mode or rather  Mockery  of the antient  magical Incanta∣tion    The learned Selden observes on this Occasion that there was never a merry World since the Fai∣ries left dancing and the  Parson left conjuring  I subjoin a very pertinent Quotation from the learned Author of the Origin and Increase of Depravity in Religion  Apud tum  Poetas  tum  Historiographos  de magicis incanta∣tionibus Exorcismis et Curatione tum hominum quam bellua∣rum per  Carmina  haud pauca habentur sed horum Impietatem omnium superat longè hac in re  Papismus  Hic enim  supra Dei potestatem  posse  Carmina  posse  Exorcismos  affirmatita ut nihil sit tam  obstrusum  in coelis quod Exorcismis non  pateat  nihil tam  abditum  in  inferno  quod non  eruatur  Nihil in Terrarum silentio  inclusum  quod non  eliciatur  Nihil in hominum pectoribus  con∣ditum  quod non  reveletur  nihil  ablatum  quod non  restituatur  et nihil quod habet Orbis  sive insit sive non è quo Daemon non ejiciatur  Moresini Deprav Rel Orig p  Pliny tells us that  Houses  were antiently  hallowed  against  Evil Spirits  with  Brimstone  This  Charm  has been converted by later Times into what our Satyrist  Churchill  in his Prophecy of Famine calls "a  precious  and  rare Medicine  " and is now used but I sup∣pose with greater Success in  exorcising  those of our unfortunate Fellow Creatures who are  haunted  or  possessed  with a certain  fiery Spirit  said by the Wits of the South to be well known  seen  and  felt  and very troublesome in the  North  The Opinion of the latter kept Thieves in Awe and did as much Good in a Country as a Justice of Peace  This facetious and pointedly sensible Writer en∣quires farther  Why have we now none  possest  with  Devils  in England The old Answer is The  Devil  hath the  Protestants  already and the  Papists  are so  holy  he dares not meddle with them  Casting out Devils  he adds is mere juggling they never  cast out  any but what they first  cast in  They do it where for Reverence no Man shall dare to examine it they do it in a Corner in a Mor∣ticehole not in the Marketplace They do no∣thing but what may be done by Art they make the  Devil fly  out of the  Window  in the Likeness of a  Bat  or a  Rat  Why do they not  hold  him Why in the Likeness of a  Bat  or a  Rat  or some  Creature  that is Why not in some Shape we paint him in with  Claws  and  Horns  Answer may be made to his pertinent Question that  real Bats  and  Rats  may be procuredbut every Carver is not to be trusted with the making of a  horned  or  clovenfooted  Image of the  Devil  Impious and antichristian Rome  In an Age when every wretched Sophister drawing his  Conclu∣sions  from false  Premises  wishes to confound the pure Spirit of Christian Philosophy with these and the like  Adulterations  of it I must at least be pardoned for obtruding the subsequent  Eulogy  extracted from an old Tragedyno professed Divine has perhaps ever exhibited more forcibly the  Grandeur  and  Utility  of  Christi∣anity  than these few Lines do  If these are  Christian  Virtues I am  Christian  The  Faith  that can  inspire  this generous  Change  Must  be  divine  and  glows with all  its  God  Friendship and Constancy and Right and Pity  All these were Lessons I had learn'd before  But this  unnatural Grandeur  of the  Soul  Is  more than mortal  and  outreaches  Virtue  It  draws  it  charms  it  binds  me to be  Christian  Hill's Alzira  it is impossible to say how much thou hast prejudiced the Cause of  manly  and  rational  Religion by these and the like thy childish to give no harsher Name to thy Fooleries and Superstitions  CHAP XII  Of  Saturday  Afternoon how observed of old by the ancient Christians the Church of  Scotland  and the old Church of  England  What End we should observe it for An Exhortation to the Observation of it  IT is usual in Country Places and Villages where the Politeness of the Age hath made no great Conquest to observe some particular Times with some Ceremonies which were customary in the Days of our Forefathers Such are the great Festivals of Christmas Easter and several others which they observe with Rites and Customs appropriated to them  Among these we find a great Deference paid to  Saturday Afternoon  above the other worky Days of the Week Then the Labours of the Plough ceast and Refreshment and Ease are over all the Village  This seems to be the Remains of a laudable Custom once in this Land but now almost buried in that general Contempt of Religion and Love of the World which prevail so much every where of attending the Evening Prayers on Saturday and laying aside the Concerns of this Life to be fitter for the Duties of the  Day following For  Baily  Prac Piety  P    it was an holy Cus∣tom among our Forefathers when at the Ringing to Prayer the  Eve  before the  Sab∣bath  the  Husbandman  would give over his Labour in the Field and the  Tradesman  his Work in the Shop and go to Evening Prayer in the Church to prepare their Souls that their Minds might more chearfully attend  GOD's Worship  on the  SabbathDay  And indeed it was the Custom both of the  Jewish  and the Christian Church They nei∣ther of them entred upon the  Sabbath  without some Preparation for it  Moses  Exod xvi Mark xiv  taught the  Jews  to remember the  Sabbath  over Night from whence in all Probability it comes to pass that the Eve of the  Jewish Sabbath  is called the  Preparation  The Preparation mentioned by the Evangelists begun at Three a Clock on  Friday  Afternoon it was proclaimed with the Noise of Trumpets and Horns that they might be better put in Mind of the  Sabbath  's draw∣ing on and of that Preparation which was requisite for it  Among the primitive Christians the LORD'S Day was always usher'd in with a  Pernoctation  or  Vigil  They assembled in the House of GOD and sung Psalms and Praises to him a great Part  of the Night that they might be better pre∣pared to serve him on his own Day following  In the Year of our LORD  William  King of  Scotland  In  Scotia  anno salutis  Gulielmus  Rex primorum Regni sui concilium cogit cui etiam interfuit Pontificius Le∣gatus in quo decretum est ut Saturni Dies abhora Me∣ridiei sacer esset neque quisquam res profanas exerceret que∣madmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat Idque campanae pulsu populo indicaretur ac postea sacris rebus ut diebus festis operam darint concionibus interessent vesperas audirent idque in diem lunae facerent constituta transgresso∣ribus gravi paena  Boet Lib    de Scot ex Hospin P    called a Council of the chief Men of his Kingdom at which also was pre∣sent the Pope's Legate and it was then deter∣min'd that  Saturday  after the twelfth Hour should be kept holy that no one should fol∣low their Business nor Callings but desist as on other Holy Days That they should be put in Mind of it by the Tolling of the Bell and then mind the Business of Religion as on Holy Days be present at the Sermon and hear Vespers that this should be the Practice till  Munday  Morning and whoever acted other∣wise should be severely punished  And this as is said before was also the Custom of our own Country long before this order'd in  Scotland  For in the Year when King  Edgar  made his Ecclesiastical Laws we find one made to this very Purpose In which  it is order'd That  Dies sabbati ab ipsa diei saturni hora pomeridiana tertia usque in luminarii diei diluculum festus agitator c  Seld Analect Angl Lib    Cap    the  Sabbath  or  Sunday  shall be observed from  Saturday  at  Mr  Johnson  upon this Law says That the  NoonTide  sig∣nifies Three in the Afternoon according to our present Account And this Practice I conceive continued down to the Reforma∣tion In King  Winfred  's Time the LORD's Day did not begin till Sunset on the  Saturday  See    Numb    Three in the Afternoon was  hora nona  in the Latin Account and there∣fore called  Noon  How it came afterwards to signifie  Midday  I can but guess The Monks by their Rules could not eat their Dinner till they had said their  Noon Song  which was a Ser∣vice regularly to be said at Three a Clock but they probably an∣ticipated their Devotions and their Dinner by saying their  Noon Song  immediately after their  Midday Song  and presently fall∣ing on I wish they had never been guilty of a worse Fraud than this But it may fairly be supposed that when  Midday  became the Time of Dining and saying  Noon Song  it was for this Rea∣son called Noon by the Monks who were the Masters of the Lan∣guage during the dark Ages In the Shepherds Almanack Noon is Mid day Highnoon Three a Clock  Johnson Const Part Ann  Noon till the Light appear on  Munday  Morning  Now hence hath come the present Custom of spending a Part of  Saturday  Afternoon with∣out servile Labour And that our Forefathers when the Bell was heard attended the Evening Prayer not fearing the Loss of Time nor the Necessities of Poverty Happy would it be for us would we so banish the Care of the Body for the Care of the Soul Would we leave to converse about secular Business and mind then  the Business of Religion would we remember that it is  Luke xxiii  the  Preparation and that the  Sab∣bath  draws on  When  Jacob  was going to worship GOD at  Bethel  he order'd his Family  to  Gen xxxv  put away the strange Gods that were among them and be clean and change their Garments and arise and go to  Bethel He knew that the GOD of Pu∣rity and Holiness was to be approached with the utmost Purity they could possibly cloth themselves with And would we before we enter into the Presence of GOD on his own Day endeavour to purifie our selves from the Filth of the World we have contracted in the Days before would we disperse these busy Swarms of Things which so attract our Minds and prepare our selves for the follow∣ing Day we should appear before GOD less earthly and more heavenly less sinful and more holy  Our  Psalm cxliv  Prayers would be set forth in his Sight as the Incense and the lifting up of our Hands be an Evening Sacrifice  And like the Smell of  Jacob  's Garment in the Nostrils of his Father the Smell of our Prayers  would  Gen xxvii  be like the Smell of a Field which the LORD hath blessed  And now what is this Preparation but the  Trimming of our Lamps  against we meet  the LORD on the next Day Our Bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their Labour that they may be active and vigorous and our Souls washed with Sobri∣ety and Temperance and the private or public Prayer of the Evening Thus should we meet the LORD at  Bethel  and obtain those Mercies we sought of him there  Art thou then blessed with an affluence of Things and hath Providence placed Thee above the careful Sations of Life What Rea∣son then can be sufficient for thy Neglect of this Custom For neither canst thou plead the want of Time neither dost thou dread the straits of Poverty  Or art thou involv'd in the Cares of Busi∣ness  Dost thou earn thy Bread by the Sweat of thy Face and the Labours of thy Hands O well is Thee And happy mayst thou be  Wouldst thou dedicate this small Time to the Service of GOD it would be like the Wi∣dow's Mite which was more than all that was thrown into the Treasury But perhaps thou wilt say thou art under the Yoke sub∣ject to Servitude and obliged to work even to the latter End of the Day It may be so but yet as GOD is every where present so wouldst thou Remember that it is the Prepa∣ration and put up an Ejaculation at thy Work GOD would accept it and it would prove to  thee an equal Good with the other Prepara∣tion  Cassian  Haec officiaper totum dici spatium jugiter cum operis adjectione spontanea celebrantur  Cassian Instit Lib    Cap    tells us That the antient Monk whilst they were working in the pri∣vate Cells repeated their Religious Offices And St  Jerom  when he is commending the pleasing Retirement of the Village of  Bethle∣hem  In Christi villa tuta rusticitas est Extra psalmos silen∣tium est Quocunque te verteris arator stiuam retinens alleluia decantatur sud  ns messor psalmis se advocat c  Hierom Ep    ad Marcel  says That in the Village of CHRIST there is a secure Rusticity No Noise is heard there but the Singing of Psalms Where∣soever you go you have either the PloughMan singing Hallelujahs as he's holding the Plough or the sweating Mower pleasing him∣self with Hymns or the Vinedresser singing  David  's Psalms These without doubt were acceptable to GOD and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also  But if thou art not ty'd down by Necessity do not say that the common Necessaries of Life require then thy Labour For this is not losing but  Redeeming the Time  what thou spendest in the Care of thy Soul is not lost in the Care of thy Body Never was Man poorer for observing the Duties of Re∣ligion If thou lose any Thing of the Wages  of the Day to do the Service of GOD he will take care to supply it thou shalt be no loser  Why then art thou fearful O Thou of little Faith Why dost thou take so much Thought for thy Life Behold the Fowls of the Air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into Barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them Art thou not much better than they And why takest thou thought for Rayment Con∣sider the Lilies of the Field they toil not nei∣ther do they Spin and yet I say unto thee that  Solomon  in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of these And shall he not much more Cloath thee O Thou of little Faith Therefore take no Thought for what thou shalt Eat or what thou shalt Drink or where withal thou shall be Cloathed but seek thou first the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteousness  prefer the Care of these to the Care of all other Things  and all these Things shall be added unto Thee  Let not then the busy Cares of this Life be any hinderance to thy Care of the other set apart this small Time for the Time of Preparation and look on it as an Emblem of the whole Time of Life Which is our Day of Preparation for the eternal Sabbath the everlasting Rest the undisturbed Quiet of the other Life  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XII  THE religious Observation of the  Saturday Afternoon  is now entirely at an End I should be happy were I able to say with Truth that the Conclusion of that of the Sunday too did not seem to be approaching  Mr Bourne uses great Affectation in translating the Quotation from Selden He has printed the Latin erroneously too It ought to be  in  lunaris diei  diliculum c  The Sabbath was not to be observed from Saturday  at Noon  but from  three o'Clock  on that Day in the  Afternoon  and whatever Part of the Day might have been called  Noon  at the Time he alludes to he might have hinted to us in a Note without confounding it in his Text with the  Midday  of this Age  To our Author's Account of the Custom of the old Churches of England and Scotland an  Alte∣ration  may be added of which he seems never to have heard It is that in the Year at a Provincial Council held by Archbishop Mepham at Magfield after Complaint made that instead of fasting upon the Vigils they ran out to all the Excesses of Riot c it was appointed among many other Things relative to Holy Days  that the Solemnity for Sunday should begin upon  Saturday  in the  Evening  and not before to prevent the Misconstruction of keeping a Judai∣cal  Sabbath  Mr Wheatly tells us that in the  East  the Church thought sit to indulge the Humour of the Judaizing Christians so far as to observe the  Saturday  as a Festival Day of Devotion and thereon to meet for the Exercise of religious Dutiesas is plain from several Passages of the Antients Illustration of Common Prayer p    See Collier's Ecclesiastic Hist Vol I p  Our Author's Exhortation towards the Conclusion of this Chapter is I think liable to Misconstruction An  Inference  might easily be deduced from it in favour of IdlenessPerhaps Men who live by manual Labour or have Families to support by it cannot better spend their  Saturday Afternoon  than in following the several Callings in which they have employed themselves on the preceding Days of the WeekIndustry will be no bad Preparation to the Sabbath  Considered in a Political View much Harm hath been done by that prodigal  Waste  of Days very falsely called  Holy Days  in the Church of Rome They have greatly favoured the Cause of Vice and Dissipation without doing any essential Service to that of rational ReligionComplaints seem to have been made in almost every  Synod  and  Council  of the Licentiousness introduced by the keeping of VigilsNor will the Philosopher wonder at this for it has its Foundation in the Nature of Things  For the Honour of human Nature which like the majestic Ruins of Palmyra though prostrate in the Dust is still respectable in its Decay I forbear to translate the subsequent Quotation from Dr Moresin  Et videre contigit Anno Lugduni in  Vigiliis Natalium Domini deprehensos in stupro duos post Missantis Altare  hora inter duodecimam et primam noctis cum praeter

Places  IN the  Primitive Church  ChristmasDay was always observ'd as the  Lord'sDay  was and was in like Manner preceded by an  Eve or Vigil  Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an  Eve  before it which is observed by the Religious as a Day of Preparation for that great Festival  Our ForeFathers when the common De∣votions of the  Eve  were over and Night was come on were wont to light up  Candles  of an uncommon Size which were called  ChristmasCandles  and to lay a  Log  of Wood upon the Fire which they termed a  YuleClog  or  ChristmasBlock  These were to Illuminate the House and turn the Night into Day which Custom in some Measure is still kept up in the Northern Parts  It hath in all probability been derived from the  Saxons  For  Bede  tells us That this very Night was observed in this Land before by the  Heathen Saxons  They  Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum  Januarii  die ubi nunc natale domini celebramus ipsam noctem nuuc nobis sacrosanctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack i e matrum noctem appellabant Ob causam ut suspicamur ceremoniarum quas in ea pervigiles agebant  Beda de Rat Temp Cap    began says  he their Year on the Eight of the Calends of  January  which is now our  ChristmasDay  And the very Night before which is now Holy to us was by them called  Maedrenack  or the  Night of Mothers  because as we ima∣gine of those Ceremonies which were per∣form'd that Night The  YuleClog  therefore hath probably been a Part of that Night's Ceremonies The very Name seems to speak it and tells its Original to every Age  It seems to have been used as an Emblem of the return of the  Sun  and the lengthening of the Days For as  December  guili eodem quo  Januarius  nomine vocatur Guili a conversione solis in auctum diei nomen accipit  Beda ibid  both  December  and  Ja∣nuary  were called  Guili or  Gehol  or  Geol  Angl Sax Jol vel Jul Dan Sax  And to this Day in the North  Yule Youle  signifies the solemn Festival of  Christmas  and were Words used to denote a Time of Festivity very anciently and before the Introduc∣tion of Christianity among the Northern Nations Learn∣ed Men have disputed much about this Word some deriving it from  Julius Caesar  others from the Word  Gehthe  l  a  Wheel  as  Bede  who would therefore have it so called because of the Return of the Sun's annual Course after the Winter Solitice But he writing  de Rat Temp  speaks rather as an Astronomer than an An  i  ry The best Antiquaries derive it from the Word  Ol Ale  which was much used in their Festivities and merry Meetings And the  I in Iol iul cimbr as the Ge and Gi in Gehol Geol Giul Sax  are premised only as Intensives to add a little to the Signification and make it more emphatical  Ol  or  Ale  as has been observed did not only signifie the Liquor they made Use of but gave Denomination likewise to their greatest Festivals as that of Gehol or Yule at  Midwinter  and as is yet plainly to be discern'd in that Custom of the  WhitsanAle  at the other great Festival  Elstob Sax Hom Birth DayGreg Append P    Bishop  Stillingfleet  has also taken Notice of this and says  That some think the Name of this Feast was taken from  Iola  which in the  Gothick  Language signifies to  make merry  But he seems not inclinable to this Opinion and therefore tells us that  Olaus Rudbeck  thinks the former  viz  Its being called so from the Joy that was conceived at the Return of the Sun more proper not only from  Bede  's Authority but because in the old  Runick Fasti  a Wheel was used to denote that Festival  Stilling Orig Britain  Yule  upon Ac∣count  of the Sun's Returning and the In∣crease of the Days so I am apt to believe the Log has had the Name of the  YuleLog  from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun and the Increase of its Light and Heat  This was probably the Reason of the Cu∣stom among the  Heathen Saxons  but I can∣not think the Observation of it was continued for the same Reason after Christianity was embraced For Bishop  Stillingfleet  observes in his  Origines Britanicae  That though the ancient  Saxons  observed Twelve Days at that Time and sacrificed to the Sun in  hopes of his Returning yet when Chris∣tianity prevailed all these Idolatrous Sa∣crifices were laid aside and that Time of Feasting was joined with the religious So∣lemnity of that Season which in other Parts of the World were observed by Christians  And in like Manner as these Days of Feasting were joined with the reli∣gious Solemnities of that Season so the keep∣ing up of this Custom seems to have been done with another View than it was ori∣ginally If a Conjecture may be allowed it might have been done on Account of our Saviour's Birth which happened that Night For as the Burning of it before Christianity was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun which they worshipped as their God so the continuing it after might have been for a Symbol of that Light which was that Night born into the World  The Light that shineth in Darkness the Light that lightned the  Gen∣tiles  that turn'd them from Darkness to Light and from the Power of Satan unto GOD  And indeed it will be some strengthening of the Conjecture that Light has been the Emblem of several Things both in Scripture and in the ancient Church For the Scripture makes use of it and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture as a lively Reresentation of several Things Thus Light is the Emblem of  GOD For GOD is Light  says the Apostle St  John  John  the Baptist was a Burning and a Shining Light  And therefore in some Places it  Feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes fiunt ig∣nes qui significant sanctum  Joannem  qui fuit lumen lucerna ardens praecedens praecursor verae lucis quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum  Durand Rational Lib    Cap    Nu    is customary to carry Torches on St  John the Baptist  's Eve to represent St  John Baptist  himself who was  a Burning and a Shining Light and a Preparer of the Way for the True Light that lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World  The Apostles were  the Light of the World  and as our Saviour was frequently called  Light  so was his Coming into the World signified and pointed out by the Emblems of Light  It was then says our Countryman  Gregory  the longest Night in all the Year and it was the midst of that and yet there was Day where he was For a glorious and betokening Light shined round about this  Holy Child  So says Tra∣dition and so the Masters describe the Night Piece of the Nativity  If this be called in Question as being only Tradition it is out of Dispute that the Light which illuminated the Fields of  Bethlehem  and shone round about the  Shepherds  as they were watching their Flocks was an Em∣blem of that Light which was then come  into the World What  Quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque claritatis splendor eos circumdedit quod nunquam in tota testamenti veteris serie reperimus cum tam innumeris vicibus angeli prophetis justis apparuerunt nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus nisi quod hoc privilegi∣um recte hujus temporis dignitati servatum est c  Bed Hyem de Sanct in Gal Cant  can be the meaning says  venerable Bede  that this Apparition of Angels was surrounded with that heavenly Light which is a Thing we never meet with in all the Old Testament For tho' Angels have appeared to Prophets and holy Men yet we never read of their Appearing in such Glory and Splendor before It must surely be because this Privilege was reserved for the Dignity of this Time For when the true Light of the World was born in the World it was very proper that the Proclaimer of his Nativity should appear in the Eyes of Men in such an heavenly Light as was before un∣seen in the World And that  supernatural Star  which was the Guide of the  Eastern Magi  was a Figure of that  Star  which was risen out of  Jacob of that Light which should lighten the  Gentiles  GOD says Bishop  Taylor  sent a miraculous Star to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious Light the Light of Grace and Glory  In Imitation of this as  Gregory  tells us the Church went on with the Ceremony And  hence it was that for the three or four First  Centuries  the whole  Eastern Church  called the Day which they observed for our Savi∣our's Nativity the  Epiphany  or Manifestation of the Light And  Cassian  tells ut  Intra  Egypti  Regionem mos iste traditione antiqua serva∣tur ut peracto epiphaniorum die c  Cassian Coll    C    That it was a Custom in  Egypt  handed down by Tradition as soon as the  Epiphany  or  Day of Light  was over  c  Hence also came that ancient Custom of the same Church taken Notice of by St  Jerome  of  Absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias quum legendum est evangelium accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante non utique ad fugandas tenebras sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum c  Jerom Cont Vigil Cap    lighting up Candles at the Reading of the Gospel even at NoonDay and that not to drive away the Darkness but to speak their Joy for the good Tidings of the Gospel and be an Emblem of that Light which the Psalmist says  was a Lamp unto his Feet and a Light unto his Paths  Light therefore having been an Emblem of so many Things and particularly of our LORD JESUS CHRIST both in the sacred History and in the Practice of the Church it is no way improbable that after their Con∣version the  Saxons  used it as an Emblem of him who that Night came into the World  and was the Light thereof In the City of  Constantinople  on the  Eve of Easter  there was a Custom practised much like this of ours on  ChristmasEve  For then the whole City was illuminated with Tapers and Torches which continued all the Night turning the Night into Day till almost the Day appeared The Reason of this Custom was to represent that Light which the next Day arose upon the World The Difference between these two Customs is that of the Time the Reason of their Observation is much the same The one illuminated the  Eve of Easter  that there might be an Emblem of the Sun of Righte∣ousness who the next Day arose upon the World the other the Eve of  Yule  to give an Emblem of that Light which was the  Day spring from on High  Nay this Eve of  Yule  as  Gregory  tells us  was illuminated with so many Tapors among the Ancients as to give to the  Vigil  the Name of  Vigilia Lumi∣num  and the Ancients says he did well to send Lights one to another whatever some think of the  ChristmasCandle  Eus Vit Constan Cap    Lib    OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XIII  MR

new Year  They get in Return from the Houses they stop at  Pears Apples Nuts  and even  Money  Little Troops of Boys and Girls still go about in this very Manner at Newcastle some few Nights before on the Night of the  Eve  of this Day and on that of the  Day itself  The  Hagmena  is still preserved among them They still  conclude  too with wishing "  It is ordinary among some Plebeians in the South of Scot∣land to go about from Door to Door upon Newyear's Eve cry∣ing  Hagmane  a corrupted Word from the Greek  i e  Holy Month  It is more probably a Corruption of some Saxon Words  John Dixon holding forth against this Custom once in a Ser∣mon at Kelso says "Sirs do you know what  Hagmane  signi∣fies It is  the Devil be in the House  that's the Meaning of its  Hebrew  Original"  Vide

 The  Mass  at that Time was called  Christmass  Christmass  says Selden succeeds the  Saturnalia  the same  Time  the same  Number  of  Holy Days  when the Master waited upon the Servants like the  Lord  of  Misrule  Table Talk  In the Feast of Christmass says Stow in his Survey there was in the King's House a  Lord  of  Misrule  or  Master  of  Merry Dis∣ports  and the like had ye in the House of every Nobleman of Honour or good Worship were he  spiritual  or  temporal  The Mayor of London and either of the Sheriffs had their several  Lords  of  Misrule  ever contending without Quarrel or Offence who should make the  rarest Pastimes  to delight the Beholders These Lords beginning their  Rule  at  Allhallon Eve  continued the same till the Morrow after the Feast of the Purification commonly called  Candlemas Day  In which Space there were  fine  and  subtil Disguisings Masks  and  Mummeries  with  playing at Cards for Counters Nayles  and  Points  in every House more for  Pastime  than for  Gaine  P  On the pulling down of Canterbury Court Christ Church Oxford many of these  Counters  were found There was a Hole in the Center of each and they appeared to have been  strung  together I saw many of them having been in Oxford at that Time  the  Box Christmass Box  or  Money  gathered against that Time that  Masses  might he made by the Priests to the Saints to  forgive  the  People  the  Debaucheries  of  that Time  and from this Servants had the  Li∣berty  to  get Box Money  that  they too  might be  enabled  to  pay  the  Priest  for his  Masses  knowing well the Truth of the Proverb  No Penny No Paternoster  Christmass says Blount was called the  Feast of Lights  in the Western or Latin Church because they used many  Lights  or  Candles  at the Feast or rather because Christ the  Light  of all  Lights  that true  Light  then came into the World  Hence it should seem the  Christmass Candle  and what was perhaps only a  Succedaneum  the  Yule Clog  Clog  is properly a Piece of Wood fastened about the Legs of Beasts to keep them from running astray In a secondary or figu∣rative Sense it signifies a  Load Let  or  Hinderance  Thus also a  TruantClog  Bailey supposes it to come from  Log  which he derives from the Saxon ligan to  lie  because of its Weight it lies as it were  immoveable  the Trunk of a Tree or Stump of Wood for Fuel  Block  has the same Signification  There is an old Scotch Proverb  He's as  bare  as the  Birk  at  Yule  Even  which perhaps alludes to this Custom the  Birk  meaning a  Block  of the  Birch Tree stripped  of its  Bark  and  dried  against  Yule Even  It is spoken of one who is exceedingly poor  or  Block  before  Candies  This is merely Conjecture and yet we can do little else but make  Conjectures  concerning the Origin of Customs of such remote Antiquity  Perhaps the  Yule Block  will be found at last only the  Coun∣ter Part  of the  Midsummer Fires  made on  within Doors  be∣cause of the  cold Weather  at this Winter Solstice as those in the  hot Season  at the Summer one are kindled in the  open Air  After a diligent and close Study of  Ge  elin  the French  Bryant  on this Subject one cannot fail I think of adopting this Hypothesis which is confirmed by great Probability and many cogent if not infallible Proofs  were in ge∣neral Use Thus a very  large Coal  is often set a∣part at present in the North for the same Purpose i e to make a great  Light  on  Yule  or  Christmass  Eve Lights  indeed seem to have been used upon all festive OccasionsThus our  Illuminations Fire∣works  c on the News of Victories  In the antient Times to which we would trace back the Origin of these almost obsolete Customs  Blocks Logs  or  Clogs  of dried Wood might be easily procured and provided against this festive Season At that Time of Day it must have been in the Power but of a  few  to command  Candles  or  Torches  for making their  annual Illumination  Besides the Definitions of the Word  Yule  which Bourne gives us from  Elstob  Stillingfleet c I shall lay yet others before my Readers but perhaps ought not to presume to  determine  which is abso∣lutely the truest Etymon There have been great Controversies about this Word and many perhaps will think it still left in a State of Uncertainty like the Subject of the  "Certant et adhuc sub judice lis est" of

ANother Custom observed at this Season is the adorning of Windows with  Bay  and  Laurel  It is but seldom observed in North but in the SouthernParts it is very Common particularly at our  Universities  where it is Customary to adorn not only the Common Windows of the  Town  and of the  Colleges  but also to bedeck the  Chapels  of the  Colleges  with  Branches of Laurel  The  Laurel  was used among the ancient  Romans  as an Emblem of several Things and in particular of  Laurus pacifera habetur quam praetendi inter arma∣tos hostes quietis sit indicium Romanis praecipue laetitiae vic∣toriarumque nuntia  Polyd Virg de Rer Invent Lib    Cap    P    Peace  and Joy and Victory And I imagine it has been used at this Season by Christians as an Emblem of the same Things as an Emblem of Joy for the Victory gain'd over the Powers of Darkness and of that  Peace on Earth that Goodwill towards Men  which the Angels sung over the Fields of  Bethlehem  It  The general Defence of the three Articles of the Church of  England  D    has been made use of by the  Non Con∣formists  as an Argument against Ceremonies that the second Council of  Bracara  Non liceat iniquas observantias

with Bay Leaves and Green Boughes  But the Council does not mean that it was wrong in Christians to make use of these Things but only  at the same Time with the Pagans when they observed and solemnized their Paganish Pastime and Worship  And of this Prohibi∣tion they give this Reason in the same  Canon Omnis haec observatio paganismi est  All this kind of Custom doth hold of Paganism Be∣cause the outward Practice of  Heathenish Rites  perform'd jointly with the Pagans themselves could not but imply a Consent in Paganism  But at present there is no hazard of any such Thing It may be an Emblem of Joy to us without confirming any in the Practice of  Heathenism  The  Time  the  Place  and the  Reasons  of the  Ceremony  are so widely diffe∣rent that tho' formerly to have observed it would unquestionably have been a Sin it is now become harmless comely and decent  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XIV  STOW  In the antient Calendar of the Church of Rome I find the following Observation

Essay in the Gentlemen's Magazine in which it is conjectured that the antient Custom of dressing Churches and Houses at Christmass with  Laurel Box Holly  or  Ivy  was in  Allusion  to many  figurative Expressions  in the Prophets relative to Christ  the Branch of Righteousness  c or that it was in Re∣membrance of the  Oratory  of  wrythen Wands  or  Boughs  which was the first Christian Church erected in Britain Before we can admit either of these Hypotheses the Question must be deter∣mined whether or no this Custom was not  prier  to the Introduc∣tion of the Christian Faith amongst us  The learned Dr Chandler tells us  It is related where Druidism prevailed the  Houses  were  decked  with  Evergreens  in  Decem∣ber  that the Sylvan Spirits might repair to them and remain unnipped with Frost and cold Winds until a milder Season had  renewed  the foliage of their darling Abodes  Travels in Greece  in his Survey of London tells us  Against the Feast of  Christmass  every Man's  House  as also their  Parish Churches  were  decked  with  Holme Ivy Bayes  and whatsoever the Season of the Year afforded to be Green The  Conduits  and  Standards  in the Streets were like∣wise garnished Among the which I read that  in the Year by Tempest of Thunder and Lightning toward the Morning of Candlemas Day at the Leaden Hall in Cornhilll a  Stan∣dard  of  Tree  being  set up  in the  Midst  of the  Pavement fast  in the  Ground nailed  full of  Holme  and  Ivie  for  disport  of  Christmass  to the People was  torne up  and cast downe by the  malignant  This illustrates the Spectator's Observation where he tells us that our  Forefathers  looked into Nature with other Eyes than we do now and always ascribed common  natural Effects  to  superna∣tural Causes  This  Joy  of the People at Christmass was it should seem  Death  to their  Infernal Enemy  envying their  festal Plea∣sures  and owing them a Grudge he took this Opportunity of  spoiling  their  Sport  Spirit  as was thought and the Stones of the Pavement all about were cast in the Streets and into divers Houses so that the People were sore aghast at the great Tempests  In the North there is another Custom used  at  or  about this Time  which if I mistake not was antiently observed in the Beginning of Lent The  Fool Plough  goes about a Pageant that con∣sists of a Number of  Sword Dancers  Aliter the  White Plough  so called because the  gallant  young Men that compose it appear to be dressed in their  Shirts  without  Coat  or Waistcoat upon which great Numbers of Ribbands folded into Roses are loosely stitched on It appears to be a very  airy  Habit at this  cold  Season but they have warm Waistcoats under it  Mr Wallis in his History of Northumberland tells us that the  Saltatio armata  of the Roman Militia on their Festival  Armilus∣trium  celebrated th of October is still practised by the Country People in this Neighbourhood on the annual Festivity of  Christmass  the  Yule Tide  of the Druids  Young Men march  from  Village  to  Village  and from  House  to  House  with  Music  before them  dressed  in an  antic Attire  and before the  Vestihulum  or  Entrance  of every House entertain the Family with the  mo∣tus incompositus  the  Antic Dance  or  Chorus Armatus  with  Swords  or  Spears  in their  Hands erect  and  shining  this they call the  Sword Dance  For their Pains they are presented with a  small Gratuity in Money  more or less according to every Householder's Ability their Gratitude is expressed  by firing a Gun  One of the Company is distinguished from the Rest by a more antic Dress  a Fox's Skin  generally serving him for a  Covering  and  Ornament  to his  Head  the  Tail hanging down  his  Back  This  droll Figure  is their  Chief  or  Leader  He does not mingle in the Dance Vol p  dragging a  Plough with Music and one sometimes two in a very antic Dress the  Bessy  in the grotesque Habit of an  old Woman  and the  Fool  almost cover∣ed with Skins a hairy Cap on and the Tail of some Animal hanging from his Back The Office of one of these  Characters  is to go about rattling a Box amongst the Spectators of the Dance in which he collects their little Donations  This Pageant or Dance as used at present seems a Composition made up of the Gleanings of several obsolete Customs followed antiently here and elsewhere on this and the like festive Occasions  I find a very curious and minute Description of the  Sword Dance  in Olaus Magnus'  De Chorea gladiatoria vel  Armifera Saltatione  Habent praeterea septentrionales Gothi

Sport wherein they exercise their Youth consisting of a Dance with Swords in the following Manner First with their Swords  sheathed  and erect in their Hands they dance in a triple Round Then with their  drawn  Swords held erect as before Afterwards extending them from Hand to Hand they lay hold of each other's Hilt and Point while they are wheeling more moderately round and changing their Order throw themselves into the Figure of a  Hexagon  which they call a RoseBut presently raising and drawing back their Swords they undo that Figure to form with them a foursquare Rose that may rebound over the Head of each At last they dance rapidly backwards and vehemently rattling the Sides of their Swords together con∣clude the Sport Pipes or Songs sometimes both direct the Measure which at first is slow but increasing afterwards becomes a very quick one towards the Conclusion  He calls this a Kind of  Gymnastic Rite  Dr Moresin alludes to a Dance at this Season  without Swords  in these Words  Sicinnium  Genus Saltationis seu Choreae ubi  Saltitantes cantabant  ac Papistae facere sunt soliti in Scotia ad  Natalitia Domini  et  alibi  adhuc servant p  in which the Ignorant were successively instructed by those who were skilled in it And thus it must have been preserved and handed down to usI have been a frequent Spectator of this Dance which is now  performed with few or no Alterations only they  lay their Swords  when  formed into  a  Figure  upon the  Ground  and  dance round  them  With regard to the  Plough  drawn about on this Occasion I find the  Monday after Twelfth Day  called antiently as Coles tells us  Plough Monday  when our northern  Plough Men  beg  Plough Money  to drink  it is very probable they would draw about a  Plough  on the Occasion so in  hard Frosts  our  Watermen  drag  a Boat about  the  Streets begging Money  And he adds  In some Places if the Ploughman after that Day's Work come with his Whip to the Kitchen Hatch and cry Cock in Pot" before the Maid says "Cock on the Dunghill" he gains a Cock for Shrove Tues∣day  Coles tells us also of an old Custom in some Places of Far∣mers giving  Sharping Corn  to their  Smith  at Christmass for  sharp∣ing Ploughirons  c    Vide Cockfighting in the Appendix  Joannes Boëmus Aubanus  In die Cinerum mirum est quod in plerisque locis agitur Vir∣gines quotquot per annum choream

us of the following on  Ash Wednesday  Such young Women as have frequented the Dances throughout the Year are gathered together by young Men and instead of Horses are yoked to a  Plough  upon which a Piper sits and plays In this Manner they are  dragged into a Water  He suspects this to have been a Kind of selfenjoined or voluntary Penance  for not having abstained from their favourite Sport on Holidays contrary to the Injunctions of the Church  I can find nothing more relative to the  Plough  though in Du Cange's Glossary there is a Re∣ference to some old  Laws  Aratrum circumducere  in Lege Bajuvar tit §  which mention the  "drawing a Plough about"  which I guess would have afforded something to our Purpose could I have found them  As to the  Fool  and  Bessy  they are plainly Frag∣ments of the antient  Festival  Faustinus Episcopus in Serm in Kalend Jan has these Words  Quis enim Sapiens credere poterit inveniri aliquos sanae mentis qui  Cervulum  facientes in  ferarum  se velint habitus commutari Alii  vestiuntur pellibus pecudum  alii assumunt  Capita bestiarum gaudentes  exultantes si taliter se in  ferinas Species  transforma∣verint ut homines non esse videantur  Du Cange in  Cervula  of Fools  held on New Year's Day See Trusler's Chronology  There was antiently a profane  Ludi profani apud Ethnicos et Paganossolebant ii Kalendis Januarii  belluarum pecudum  et  Vetularum  assumptis formis  huc  et  illuc  discursare et petulantiùs se se gerere quod a Christianis non modò proscriptum sed ab iis postmodum inductum constat ut  ea die  ad  calcandam Gentilium

of  Cattle  and of  old Women  The Christians adopted this Faustinus the Bishop inveighs against it with great warmthThey were wont to be covered with  Skins  of Cattle and to put on the  Heads  of Beasts c  Doctor Johnson tells us in his Journey to the Western Islands that a Gentleman informed him of an odd Game At New Year's Eve in the  Hall or Castle of the Laird where at festal Seasons there may be supposed a very numerous Company one Man dresses himself in a  Cow's Hide  upon which other Men  beat  with  Sticks  He runs with all this Noise round the House which all the Company quits in a counterfeited Fright the Door is then shut At New Year's Eve there is no great pleasure to be had out of Doors in the He∣brides They are sure soon to recover from their Terror enough to solicit for Readmission which for the Honour of Poetry is not to be obtained but by repeating a Verse with which those that are know∣ing and provident take care to be furnished  This is no doubt a Vestige of the  Festival  Affirmant se vidisse annis singulis in Romana Urbe juxta Ec∣clesiam S Petri in die vel nocte quando Calendae Januarii intrant Paganorum consuetudine choros ducere per plateas acclamationes

of Fools  above describedSee Du Cange's Glossary in Verbo  Kalendae  c c The  vestiuntur pellibus pecudum  and  a Man's dressing him∣self in a Cow's Hide  both too on the first of January are such Circumstances as leave no Room for Doubt but that allowing for the Mutilations of Time they are  one  and the  same Custom  The learned Traveller tells us that they who played at this odd Game gave no Account of the Origin of it and that he de∣scribed it as it might perhaps be used in other Places where the Reason of it is not yet forgotI am persuaded that if Dr Johnson will take the Trouble of consulting Du Cange's Glossary in Verb  Cervula    Kalendae  he will no longer remain ignorant of the Ori∣ginal of this singular Custom  N B The learned Reader is requested to substitute  ut  for the

unbecoming  AS soon as the Morning of the  Nativity  appears it is customary among the common People to sing a  ChristmasCarol  which is a Song upon the Birth of our Savi∣our and generally sung with some  Such are  The NewYear's Songs  and that whose Bur∣den is  Hagmena  The Word  Hagmena  is the same as  Hagia∣meene  or the  Holy Month Angli  says  Hospinnian Haleg∣monath quasi sacrum mensem vocant  Hosp de Orig Eth P    others from the Nativity to the TwelvethDay the Continuance of  Christmas  It comes they say from  Cantare  to sing and  Rola  which is an Interjection of Joy For in ancient Times the Burden of the Song when Men were Merry was  Rola Rola  This kind of Songs is of an ancient stand∣ing They were sung early in the Church it self in memory of the Nativity as the many HYMNS for that Season manifestly declare  Tertullian  says  Ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio ingenio potest provocatur in medium Deo cantare  Tertul Advers Gent C    it was customary among the Christians at their Feasts to bring those who were able to sing into the Midst and  make them sing a Song unto  GOD  either out of the Holy Scripture or of their own Com∣posing and Invention And as this was done at their Feasts so no doubt it was observed at the great Feast of the Nativity which Song no Question of it was to them what the  ChristmasCarol  should be to us In after Ages we have it also taken Notice of For  Durand  tells us  In quibusdam quoque locisIn natali Praelati cum suis clericis ludant vel in domibus episcopalibus Ita ut etiam descendantAd cantus  Durand Rat Lib    C    S    That on the Day of the  Nativity  it was usual for the Bishops of some Churches to sing among their Clergy in the Episcopal House which Song was undoubt∣ed a  ChristmasCarol  The Reason of this Custom seems to be an Imitation of the  Gloria in Excelsis  or  Glory be to GOD on High  c which was sung by the Angels as they hovered o'er the Fields of  Bethlehem  in the Morning of the Nativity For even that Song as the learned Bishop  Taylor  observes was a ChristmasCarol  As soon  says he  as these blessed Choristers had sung their Christmas Carol and taught the Church a Hymn to put into her Offices for Ever in the Anniversary of this Festivity the Angels  c  Was this performed with that Reverence and Decency which are due to a Song of this Nature in Honour of the Nativity and Glory  to our LORD it would be very commend∣able but to sing it as is generally done in the midst of  Rioting and Chambering and Wan∣toness  is no Honour but Disgrace no Glory but an Affront to that Holy Season a Scan∣dal to Religion and a Sin against CHRIST  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XV  THE subsequent Specimen of a very curious  Carrol  in the Scotch Language preserved in  Ane compendious

other Northern Parts they have an old Custom after Sermon or Service on Christ∣mass Day the People will even in the Churches cry  Ule Ule  as a Token of rejoicing and the common Sort run about the

shall add a third 'tis Scotch  "A  Yule Feast  may be quit at Pasche" That is one good Turn deserves another  In the Collection of old Scotch Ballads abovementioned there is a  Hunting Song  in which the Author  runs down  Rome with great Fury I subjoin a Specimen  The Hunter is Christ that hunts in haist  The Hunds are Peter and Paul  The Paip is the Fox Rome is the Rox  That rubbis us on the Gall  Indulgencies  are alluded to in a comical Thought in the follow∣ing Stanza  "He had to sell the Tantonie Bell  And Pardons therein was  Remission  of  Sins  in  auld  Sheep Skinnis  Our Sauls to

travesty  by Stern∣hold are retained in our religious Assemblies    But when it's gone it's never the near  Dr Johnson tells us that the  Pious Chansons  a Kind of  Christmass Carrol  containing some Scripture History thrown into loose Rhythms were sung about the Streets by the common People when they went at that Season to  beg Alms  Hamlet Appendix Vol VIII  CHAP XVI  Of NewYear'sDay's Ceremonies The NewYear'sGift an harmless Custom wishing a good NewYear no Way sinful Mumming a Custom which ought to be laid aside  AS the Vulgar are always very careful to End the  old Year  well so they are also careful of Beginning well the  new one  As they End the Former with a hearty Compota∣tion so they begin the Latter with the Sending of Presents which are termed NewYear's Gifts to their Friends and Acquaintances The Original of both which Customs is  Et sic quidem annum veterem terminamus novumque auspicamur inauspicatis prorsus dirisque auspiciis  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ P

make merry  Stilling  ibid  Jola  's and  Snorro Sturleson  describeth this NewYear's  Feast just as  Buchannan  sets out the  British Saturnalia  by Feasting and sending Presents or NewYear's Gifts one to another  The Poet  Naogeorgus  says  JaniCalendis  Atque etiam strenae charis mittuntur amicis  Conjugibus{que} viri donant gnatis{que} parentes  Et domini famulis c  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ P    That it was usual at that Time for Friends to present each other with a NewYear's Gift for the Husband the Wife the Parents their Chil∣dren and Master's their Servants which as  Hospin  ibid  Hospinian  tells us was an ancient Custom of the Heathens and afterwards practis'd by the Christians  And no doubt those Christians were high∣ly worthy of Censure who imagined as the Heathens did that the sending of a Present then was any way  Lucky  and an  Omen  of the Success of the following Year For this was the very Thing that made both several Holy Men and some general Councils take notice of and forbid any such Custom be∣cause the Observance of it out of any such Design and View was Superstitious and Sin∣ful We are told in a Place of St  Austin  Citatur locus ex  Augustino  in quo praecipitur ne obser∣ventur calendae  Januarii  in quibus cantilenae quaedam commessationes ad invicem dona donentur quasi in prin∣cipio anni boni sati augurio  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ in Fest Jan  the Observation of the Calends of  January  is forbid the Songs which were wont to be sung on that Day the Feastings and the Presents which were then sent as a Token and Omen of a good Year But to send a Present at that Time out of Esteem or Gratitude or Charity is no where forbid On the Con∣trary it is Praise worthy For tho' the  In calendas  Januarias  antiqui patres vehementius inve∣hebantur non propter istas missitationes adinvicem mutui amoris pignora sed propter diem idolis dicatum Propter ritus quosdam profanos sacrilegos in illa solennitate adhi∣bitos  Mountacut Orig Eccles Pars Prior P    ancient Fathers did vehemently invey a∣gainst the Observation of the Calends of  Ja∣nuary  yet it was not because of those Presents and Tokens of mutual Affection and Love that passed but because the Day it self was dedicated to Idols and because of some pro∣phane Rites and Ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it If then I send a NewYear's Gift to my Friend it shall be a Token of my Friendship if to my Benefactor a Token of my Gratitude if to the  Poor  which at this Time must never be forgot it shall be to make their Hearts sing for Joy and give  Praise and Adoration to  the Giver of all good Gifts  Another old Custom at this Time is the wishing of a  good NewYear  either when a NewYear's Gift is presented or when Friends meet or when a NewYear's Song is sung at the Door the Burden of which is  we wish you a happy NewYear  This is also a Custom among the Modern  Jews  who on the first Day of the Month  The Month  Tisri  was the seventh Month according to the  Jews  sacred Computation and therefore it is commanded to be celebrated the first Day of the seventh Month  Lev xxiii  But according to their civil Computation it was their first Month so that Feast may be termed their NewYear's Day  Goodw Antiq Lib Cap  Tisri  have a splended  Reperiunt mensam dulcissimis cibis instructam Ei cum assederint quivis partem de cibis illis sumit annus inquit bonus dulcis

which were a wish for a good Year And it was customary a∣mong the Heathens on the Calends of  Janu∣ary  to go about and sing a  NewYear's Song Hospinian  therefore tells us That  Discurrunt namque noctu tam senes quam juvenes pro∣miscui sexus cautantes prae foribus divitum quibus faelicem annum cantando precantur optant  Hospin de Orig Fest Jan  when  Night comes on not only the Young but also the Old of both Sexes run about here and there and sing a Song at the Doors of the wealthier People in which they wish them a  happy NewYear  This he speaks in∣deed of the Christians but he calls it an exact Copy of the Heathens Custom  But however I cannot see the Harm of re∣taining this ancient Ceremony so it be not used superstitiously nor attended with Obsce∣nity and Lewdness For then there will be no more in it than an hearty Wish for each others Welfare and Prosperity no more Harm than wishing a good Day or good Night than in bidding one  GOD speed  or than in wishing to our Friend what  Abraham  's Servant did to himself  O  Gen xxiv  LORD GOD of my Master  Abraham  I pray thee send me good speed this Day  There is another Custom observed at this Time which is called among us  Mumming  which is a changing of Clothes between Men and Women who when dress'd in each others Habits go from one Neighbour's House to another and partake of their  Christ∣masCheer  and make merry with them in Disguise by dancing and singing and such like Merriments  This  Hoc prorsus fit ad imitationem ludorum sigillarium oscil∣larium occillatorum qui pars erat saturnaliorum circa mensem  Januarium

allowed to Servants to be free and merry with their Masters so often alluded to in Authors 'Tis probable this was done in Memory of the Liberty enjoy'd in the  Golden Age  under  Sa∣turn  before the Names of Servant and Master were known to the World Besides this they sent Presents to one another among Friends No War was to be proclaim'd and no Offen∣der executed The Schools kept a Vacation and nothing but Mirth and Freedom was to be met with in the City They kept at first only one Day the Fourteenth of the Kalends of  Ja∣nuary  but the Number was afterwards increas'd to three four five and some say seven Days    Kennet Rom Antiq P  Saturnalia  and obser∣ved by the Heathens in  January  which was a going in Disguise not publickly or to any indifferent Place but privately and to some well known Families  This Kind of Custom received a deserved Blow from the Church and was taken Notice of in the Synod  Can Trull    Bal    of  Trullus  where it was de∣creed that the Days called the  Calends  should be intirely strip'd of their Ceremonies and  the Faithful should no longer observe them That the public Dancings of Women should cease as being the Occasion of much Harm and Ruin and as being invented and observed in honour of their Gods and therefore quite averse to the Christian Life They therefore decreed that no Man should be cloathed with a Woman's Garment no Woman with a Man's  It were to be wish'd this Custom which is still so common among us at this Season of the Year was laid aside as it is the Occasion of much  Hoc autem quum noctu fiat nemini dubium esse debet

the Twelfth Day how observed The Wick∣edness of observing the Twelve Days after the common Way  ON the  Epiphany  or  Manifestation of  Christ  to the  Gentiles commonly called the TwelfthDay the  Eastern Magi  were guided by the Star to pay their Homage to their Sa∣viour and because they came that Day which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity it is therefore called the  TwelfthDay  The TwelfthDay it self is one of the great∣est of the Twelve and of more jovial Obser∣vation than the others for the visiting of Friends and ChristmasGambols The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places tho' the End of them is much the same in all namely to do Honour to the Memory of the  Eastern Magi  whom they suppose to have been Kings In  In  Gallia  unus ex ministris cIdem in  Germania  c  Hospin in Epiphan  France  one of the Courtiers is chosen King whom the King himself and the other Nobles attend at an Entertainment In  Germany  they observe the same Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities where the Students and Citizens create one of themselves  King  and provide a Magni∣ficent  Banquet for him and give him the At∣tendance of a  King  or a  stranger Guest  Now this is answerable to that Custom of the  Sa∣turnalia  of  Masters  making  Banquets  for their  Servants  and waiting on them and no doubt this Custom has in Part sprung from that  Not many Years ago this was a common  Christmas Gambol  in both our  Universities  and it is still usual in other Places of our Land to give the Name of  King  or  Queen  to that Person whose extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided  Cake  which is honour'd above the others with a  Bean  in it  But tho' this be generally the greatest of the Twelve yet the others preceding are observed with Mirth and Jollity generally to Excess Was this Feasting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation and gave more Way than it does to the Exercises and the Re∣ligious Duties of the Season it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful The keeping up of Friendship and Love and old Acquain∣tance has nothing in it harmful but the Misfortune is Men upon that Bottom act ra∣ther like Brutes than Men and like Heathens than Christians and the Preservation of Friendship and Love is nothing else but a Pretence for Drunkenness and Rioting and Wantonness And such I am afraid hath been the Observation of the Christmas Holydays  since the holiest Times of the Christian Church and the Generality of Men have rather look'd upon them as a  Vide Bishop  Blackall  's Sermon on the Lawfulness and the right Manner of keeping Christmas and other Christian Festivals  Time of Eating and Drink∣ing and Playing than of returning Praises and Thanksgivings to GOD for the greatest Benefit he ever bestow'd upon the Sons of Men  Gregory Nazianzen  in that excellent Oration of his upon ChristmasDay says Let us not celebrate the Feast after an Earthly but an Heavenly Manner let not our Doors be crown'd let not Dancing be encourag'd let not the Crosspaths be adorned the Eyes fed nor the Ears delighted  c  Let us not Feast to excess nor be Drunk with Wine  c  From this we may clearly see what has been the Custom in these Days And in all Probability it has been much the same among us from the Beginning of Christianity However fabulous that Story may be taken Notice of by  Origin Britan Stilling  Bishop  Stillingfleet  from  Hector Boethius  That King  Arthur  kept with his Nobles at  York  a very prophane  Christmas  for  ChristmasDay is said to be none of the twelve Days but one of the twenty For if it was added it would make thirteen Days which are the thirteen Days here mentioned It is said to be one of the twenty Days because as I imagine it was rec∣kon'd among those twenty Days in which the Church forbad Fast∣ing For in the Laws of  Canutus  it is order'd  Atque ab ipso natali Jesu Christi die ad octavam ad Epi∣phania lucem jejunia nemo observato nisi quidam judicio ac voluntate fecerit sua aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum  Seld Analect Lib    P    That no Man shall fast from  ChristmasDay  till after the  Octave  of the  Epiphany  except he do it out of Choice or it be commanded him of the Priest  thirteen Days toge∣ther  and that such Jollity and Feasting then had its Original from him  But however these Words if true may be a Testimony of the too great Antiquity of the Abuse of this Festival yet they will by no Means justifie  Buchannan  's Comment upon them For as the learned Bishop goes on  Buchannan  is so well pleased with this notable Observation that He sets it down for good History saying upon it that the old  Saturnalia  were re∣new'd only the Days increased and  Sa∣turn  's Name chang'd to  Caesar  's For says he we call the Feast  Julia  But why should the Name of  Saturn  be changed into  Caesar  's Was he worshipped for a GOD among the  British  Christians as  Saturn  was among the old  Pagans  But the Name  Julia  imports it by no Means For  Buchannan  does not prove that this Name was ever used for that Festival among the  Britains  and the  Saxons  who brought in both the Name and the Feast give another  Vide Chap Christ Candle  Reason for it  Buchannan  seems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side But however such Revellings and Frolicks and Extravagances whether or not derived from the old  Saturnalia  as are customary at this Season do come very near to if not ex∣ceed its Liberties In particular what com∣moner at this Season than  for Men to rise early in the Morning that they may follow strong Drink and continue untill Night till Wine inflame them As if CHRIST who came into the World to save us and was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil  was to be honour'd with the very Works he came to destroy  With some  Christmas  ends with the  Twelve Days  but with the Generality of the Vulgar not till  Candlemas  Till then they continue Feasting and are ambitious of keeping some of their  ChristmasChear  and then are fond of getting quit of it  Durand  tells us  Hanc Quadragessimam cum gaudio celebramus quia Christi incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum hominum  Du∣rand Lib    C    They celebrated this Time with Joy because the Incarnation of CHRIST was the Occasion of Joy to Angels and Men But the lengthening of the Time from twelve to forty Days seems to have been done out of Honour to the  Virgin  Mary's  Lyingin  Under the old Law the Time of Purification was forty Days which  was to Women then what the  Month  is to Women now And as during that Time the Friends and Relations of the Women pay them Visits and do them Abundance of Honour so this Time seems to have been calculated to do Honour to the Virgin's Lyingin  There is a Canon in the Council of  Trul∣lus  Can    Trul Bal  against those who bak'd a Cake in Ho∣nour of the Virgin's Lyingin in which it is decreed that no such Ceremony should be observed because it was otherwise with her at the Birth of our Saviour than with all other Women She suffer'd no Pollution and therefore needed no Purification but only in Obedience to the Law If then the Baking of a single Cake was faulty how much more so many Feasts in her Honour  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XVII  THE subsequent Extract from Collier's Ecclesi∣astical History Vol I p seems to ac∣count in a satisfactory Manner for the Name of  Twelfth Day  In the Days of King Alfred a Law was made with Relation to Holidays by  Virtue of which the  twelve  Days  after  the Nati∣vity of our Saviour were made Festivals  In the ancient

fifth of January the Vigil of the Epiphany  Kings created  or  elected  by  Beans  The sixth is called there "The Festival of Kings" and there is added  That this Ceremony of electing Kings was continued with Feasting for many Days  There was a Custom similar to this on the festive Days of Saturn among the Romans Grecians c Persons of the same Rank drew Lots for  Kingdoms  and like Kings exercised their  temporary  Authority Alex ab Alex B ch The learned  Regna sortiri inter aequales festis Saturni diebus tanquam Reges imperitare mos fuit qui etiam Romanis cum Graecis et exteris

that our Ceremony of chusing a  King  on the Epiphany or Feast of the three Kings is practised about the same Time of the YearHe is called the  Bean King  from the  Lot  This Custom is practised no where that I know of in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom but is still retained in the South  I find also in Joannes Boëmus Aubanus' Description of some singular Rites in Franconia in Germany the following  circum¦stantial  Description of this Ceremony  In Epiphania Domini  singulae Familiae  ex  melle farina  addito  Zinzibere  et  pipere libum conficiunt  et  Regem  sibi  legunt  hoc modo

Maker thrusts in at Random a  small Coin  as she is kneading it when it is  baked  it is divided into  as many Parts  as there are  Persons  in the  Family  It is  distributed  and  each  has his Share  Portions  of it also are assigned to  Christ  the  Virgin  and the  Three Magi  which are given away  in Alms  Whoever finds the  Piece of Coin  in his Share is saluted by all as  King  and being placed on a Seat or Throne is thrice lifted aloft with joyful Acclamations He holds a Piece of  Chalk  in his  Right Hand  and each Time he is lifted up makes a  Cross  on the Ceiling  These Crosses  are thought to  prevent  many  Evils  and are much revered  I gather the  present  Manner of drawing  King  and  Queen  on this Day from an ingenious Letter preserved in the Universal Magazine whence I shall take the Liberty to extract a few select Passages  I went to a Friend's House in the Country to partake of some of those innocent Pleasures that constitute a merry Christmass I did not return till I had been present at  drawing King  and  Queen  and  eaten  a  Slice  of the  twelfth Cake  made by the fair Hands of my good Friend's Consort After Tea Yesterday a  noble Cake

Curiosity of my  northern  Readers on this Head  N B  The Reader is desired to add the following Remarks to the Observations on  YULE  All the Celtic Nations have been accustomed to the Worship of the Sun either as distinguished from  Thor  or considered as his SymbolIt was a Cus∣tom that every where prevailed in antient Times to celebrate a Feast at the Winter Solstice by which Men testified their Joy at seeing this great Luminary return again to this Part of the Hea∣vensThis was the greatest Solemnity in the Year They call it in many Places  Yole  or Yuul from the Word  Hiaul  and  Houl  which even at this Day signifies the  Sun  in the Lan∣guages of Bass Britagne and Cornwal  This is giving a  Celtic  Derivation of a  Gothic  Word two Languages extremely different The learned Doctor Hickes thus derives the Term in Question  Iol  Cimbricum Anglo Saxonicè scriptum Geol et Dan Sax Jul  o  in  u  facile mutato ope in∣tensivi praefixi et ge faciunt  ol  Commessatio Compotatio c  Isl Ol

settled in Greenland See Crantz's Hist of Greenland Vol I p Ibid in Not    Vide Mallet's  Northern Antiquities  Vol II p  CHAP XVIII  Of St  Paul  's Day The Observation of the Weather a Custom of the Heathens and hand∣ed down by the Monks The Apostle St  Paul  himself is against such Observations The Opinion of St  Austin  upon them  THE Observation of the Weather which is made on this Day is altogether ridi∣culous and superstitious If it happen to be unclouded and without Rain it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Success if otherwise that the Year will be unfortunate Thus the old Verse  Clara dies  Pauli  bona tempora denotat anni  Si fuerint venti denarrant praelia genti  Si nix aut pluviae pereunt animalia quaeque  The Interprepation of which is very well known to be this  If St  Paul  's Day be fair and clear  It doth betide a happy Year  If blustering Winds do blow aloft  Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft  And if it chance to Snow or Rain  Then will be dear all Sorts of Grain  Such also is the Observation of St  Swithin  's Day which if rainy is a Token that it will rain for forty Days successively such is the  Observation of  Si sol splendescat  Maria  purificante  Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante  CandlemasDay  such is  ChildermasDay  such  Valentine'sDay  and some others  How St  Paul's Day  came to have this particular Knack of foretelling the good or evil Fortune of the following Year is no easy Matter to find out The Monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonderful Observation have taken Care it should be handed down to Posterity but why and for what Reason this Observation was to stand good they have taken Care to conceal In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down  Traditions  from Generation to Generation which being approved by an in∣fallible Judgment are to be taken for grant∣ed but as far as I hear they never pretended to an infallible Spirit in the Study of the Planets One may therefore without the Suspicion of Heresy or fear of the  Inquisition  make a little Inquiry into this Affair and see whether it be true or false whether it is built upon any Reason or no Reason whether still to be observed or only laugh'd at as a Monkish Dream  Now as it is the Day of that Saint  the great Apostle St  Paul I cannot see there is any Thing to be built upon He did indeed  labour  more abundantly than all the Apostles  but never that I heard in the Science of Astro∣logy And why his Day should therefore be a standing  Almanack  to the World rather than the Day of any other  Saint  will be pretty hard to find out I am sure there is a good Number of them have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St  Paul  and if St  Andrew  St  Thomas  c have not as much Right to Wind or Snow let the Reader judge  As it is the Twenty fifth Day of  January  one would think that could be no Reason For what is that Day more than another In∣deed they do give some Shew of Reason why Rain should happen about the Time of St  Swithin  which is this About the Time of his Feast which is on the Fourteenth of  July  there are two rainy  Constellations  which are called  Praecepe  and  Asellus  which arise  cosmically  and generally produce Rain And to be sure in the Course of the Sign  Aquarius  there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather but how these can foretell the Des∣tiny of the Year is the Question  As then there is nothing in the  Saint  or his Day to prognosticate any such Thing I mean as it is the Day of St  Paul  or the Twenty fifth of  January  so I must confess I cannot find out what may be the Ground of  this particular Observation But however thus much is very obvious that this Obser∣vation is an exact Copy of that superstitious Custom among the Heathens of observing one Day as good and another as bad For among them were lucky and unlucky Days some were  dies atri  and some  dies albi  the  atri  were pointed out in their  Calendar  with a black Character the  albi  with a white the former to denote it a Day of bad Success the latter a Day of good Thus have the  Monks  in the dark and unlearned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens and dream'd them∣selves into the like Superstitions esteeming one Day more successful than another and so according to them it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon  ChildermassDay  and what Day soever that falls on whether on a  Munday Tuesday  or any other nothing must be begun on that Day through the Year St  Paul  's Day is the Year's  FortuneTeller  St  Mark  's Day is the Prognosticator of your Life and Death  c  and so instead of persuading the People to lay aside the Whims and Fan∣cies of the Heathen World they brought them so effectually in that they are still reigning in many Places to this Day  But of all the Days of the Year they could not have chosen one so little to the Purpose For the very Saint whose Day is so observed  has himself cautioned them against any such Observation For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epistle to the  Galations  he tells them how dangerous it was  to observe Days and Months and Times and Years  which is not as some would persuade us to Caution us against the Observation of any Day but the  Lord'sDay  but only that we should not ob∣serve the abolished Feasts of the  Jews  nor the abominable Feasts of the  Gentiles  nor their superstitious Observation of fortunate and unfortunate Days St  Austin  upon this Place hath these Words  Non itaque dies observemus annos menses tem∣pora ne audiamus ab apostolo timeo vos ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis Eos enim culpat qui dicunt non profisiscar quia posterus est aut quia luna sic fertur vel profisiscar ut prospera cedant quia ita se habet positio siderum c  Beda ex Augustin in loc  Let us not observe Years and Months and Times least we hear the Apostle telling us I am afraid of you least I have shewn on you labour in Vain For the Persons he blames are those who say I will not set forward on my Journey because it is the next Day after such a Time or because the Moon is so or I'll set forward that I may have Luck because such is just now the Position of the Stars I will not Traffick this Month because such a Star presides or I will because it does I shall plant no Vines this Year because it is LeapYear  c  The learned Mr  Bingham  has among se∣veral  others a Quotation  Bingham    L C    Antiq Eccl P    Aust de Doct Christ L    C    from the same St  Austin  on these superstitious Observations with which I shall conclude this Chapter  To this kind says he belong all Ligatures and Remedies which the Schools of Physi∣cians reject and condemn whether in In∣chantments or in certain Marks which they call Characters or in some other Things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body and kept in a dancing Posture not for any Temperament of the Body but for certain Significations either Ocult or Manifest Which by a gentler Name they call Physical that they may not seem to affright Men with the Appearance of Super∣stition but do good in a natural Way Such are Earrings hanged upon the Tip of each Ear and Rings made of an Ostriches Bones for the Finger or when you are told in a Fit of Convulsions or Shortness of Breath to hold your left Thumb with your right Hand To which may be added a thousand vain Observations as if any of our Members beat if when two Friends are talking together a Stone or a Dog or a Child happens to come between them they tread the Stone to Pieces as the Divi∣der of their Friendship and this is toller∣able  in Comparison of beating an innocent Child that comes between them But it is more pleasant that sometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs for ma∣ny Times they are so superstitious as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them who turning again upon him that smites him sends him from seeking a vain Remedy to seek a real Physician indeed Hence proceed likewise these other Super∣stitions For a Man to tread upon his Thre∣shold when he passes by his own House to return back to Bed again if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his Shoes to return into his House if he stumble at his Going out if the Rats knaw his Cloths to be more terrified with the Suspicion of some future Evil then concerned for the present Loss He says  Cato  gave a wise and smart Answer to such an one who came in some Consternation to consult him about the Rats having knawed his Stock∣ings that said he is no great Wonder but it would have been a Wonder indeed if the Stockings had knawed the Rats St  Austin  mentions this witty Answer of a wise Heathen to convince Christians the better of the Unreasonableness and Vanity of all such superstitious Observations And he concludes that all such Arts whether  of triffling or more noxious Superstition are to be rejected and avoided by Christians as proceeding originally from some pernicious Society between Men and Devils and being the Compacts and Agreements of such treach∣erous and deceitful Friendship The Apostle forbids us to have Fellowship with Devils and that he says respects not only Idols and Things offered to Idols but all imagi∣nary Signs pertaining to the Worship of Idols and also all Remedies and other Ob∣servations which are not appointed publick∣ly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour but proceed from the private Fancies of Men and tend to delude the Hearts of Poor deluded Mortals For these Things have no natural Virtue in them but owe all their Efficacy to a presumptuous Confederacy with Devils And they are full of pestiferous Curiosity tormenting Anxi∣ety and deadly Slavery They were first taken up not for any real Power to be dis∣cerned in them but gained their Power by Mens observing them And therefore by the Devil's Art they happen differently to different Men according to their own Ap∣prehensions and Presumptions For the great Deceiver knows how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper and en∣snare him by his own Suspicions and Consent  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XVIII  A Great deal upon this Subject may be found in Pliny's Natural History tending to confirm what Mr Bourne has told us that it was a Custom of Gentilism adopted under the Papal Supersti∣tion and so transmitted to our Times The sub∣sequent poetical Description of the Months

A Highlander says Mr Pennant never begins any Thing of Consequence on the  Day  of the  Week  on which the  Third  of  May falls  which he calls the  dismal Day  CHAP XIX  Of  CandlemassDay  why so called the Blas∣phemy of the Church of  Rome  in consecrating Wax Candles  THIS Day goes under several Denomina∣tions It is called the Day of  CHRIST's Presentation  because on it CHRIST was pre∣sented in the Temple it is called the  HolyDay  of St  Simeon  because it was on it that he took our SAVIOUR up in his Arms And it is called the  Purification  because then the Holy Virgin was purified It is generally a Day of Festivity and more than ordinary Observation among Women and is therefore called the  Wives FeastDay  The Feasting seems to be observed in Honour of the Virgin  Mary  for as on the Day of a Woman's being  church'd  there is no common Entertainment so it seems that this Feasting was begun in the Times of Popery by Way of Compliment to the ChurchingDay of the Virgin

the Mother of thy Son whose Feast we this Day celebrate with the highest Devotion and by the Inter∣cession of all thy Saints that thou wouldst sanctifie these  Candles  to the Good and Profit of Men and the Health of his Soul and Body whether in Earth or Sea And again O LORD JESU I beseech thee that thou wouldst bless this thy Creature of  Wax  and grant it thy Heavenly Benediction by the Power of thy Holy Cross that as it was a Gift to Man by which the Darkness might be driven away so now it may be endow'd with such Virtue by the  Sign of the  Holy  Cross that wheresoever it is lighted and pla∣ced the evil Spirit may tremble and with his Servants be in such Terror and Confusion as to fly away from that Habitation and no more vex and disturb thy Servants  After this he adjures the  Wax Candles  in Words like these  Adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine Domini nostri sanctae Trinitatis ut sis extirpatio depulsio diaboli spect∣rorum ejus c  Hospin ibid  I adjure thee O thou waxen Creature in the Name of our LORD and the Holy Trinity that thou repel and ex∣tirpate the Devil and his Sprights  c  And therefore all Christians says  Eccius Tom    Hom de Purificat  ought to use these Lights with an holy Love having a sincere Depen∣dance that thus they shall be freed by the Power of the Word and this Prayer from all the Snares and Frauds of the Devil  Our Author upon this says That this is manifest Blasphemy and Idolatry For as on the one Hand they take the Name of GOD and the Holy Trinity in vain so on the other they attribute to a Wax Candle what should be ascribed to CHRIST alone and the quick∣ning Power of the Holy Ghost  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XIX  IN the forenamed antient Calendar of the Romish Church I find the subsequent Observations on the d of February usually called  Candlemas Day  "Torches are consecrated"  "Torches are given away for many Days  Feb "Purificatio Virginis  "Faces consecrantur  "Faces dantur multis diebus"  "  Pope Sergius  In a Convocation in the Reign of Henry thin the Passage that relates to Rites and Ceremoniesamong those that were not to be contemned or cast away was  bearing of Candles  on Candle∣mass Day in Memory of Christ the Spiritual  Light  of whom Simeon did prophecy as is read in the Church that Day  Fuller's Church History p  says Becon in his Reliques of Rome Fol commaunded that all the People shuld go on Procession upon  Candlemasse Day  and  carry Candels  about with them  brenning  in their  Hands  in the Year of our Lord  Durand  c  How this  Candlebearing  on  Candlemass Day  came first up the Author of our English Festival decla∣reth on this Manner "Somtyme sayeth he when the Romaines by great Myght and royal Power conquered all the World they were so proude that they forgat God and made them divers Gods after their own Lust And so among all they had a God that they called  Mars  that had been tofore a notable Knight in Battayle And so they prayed  to hym for Help and for that they would speed the better of this Knyght the People prayed and did great Worship to his Mother that was called  Februa  after which Woman much People have Opinion that the Moneth  February  is called Wherefore the d Day of thys Moneth is  Candlemass Day  The Romaines this Night went about the City of Rome with  Torches and Candles brenning  in Worship of this Woman  Februa  for hope to have the more Helpe and Succoure of her Sonne  Mars  Then was there a Pope that was called Sergius and when he saw Christian People draw to this false Maumetry and untrue Belief he thought to undo this foule Use and Custom and turn it into God's Worship and our  Lady's  and gave Com∣mandment that all Christian People should come to Church and  offer  up  a Candle brennyng  in the Worship that they did to this Woman Februa and do Worship to  our Lady  and to her Sonne our Lord Jesus Christ So that now this Feast is solemn∣ly hallowed thorowe all Christendome And every Christan Man and Woman of covenable Age is bound to come to Church and  offer  up their  Can∣dles  as though they were bodily with our  Lady  hopyng for this Reverence and Worship that they do to our Ladye to have a great Reward in Heaven c"  Ray in his Collection of Proverbs preserves one that relates to this Day  On  Candlemasday  throw  Candle  and  Candlestick  away  Somerset  CHAP XX  Of  ValentineDay  its Ceremonies what the Council of  Trullus  thought of such Customs that they had better be omitted  IT is a  Ceremony  never omitted among the Vulgar to draw Lots which they Term  Valentines  on the  Eve  before  Valentine  a Presbyter of the Church was beheaded under  Claudius  the Emperor  Valentineday  The Names of a select Number of one Sex are by an equal Number of the other put into some Vessel and after that every one draws a Name which for the present is called their  Valentine  and is also look'd upon as a good Omen of their being Man and Wife afterwards  There is a rural Tradition that on this Day every  Nature the Vicare of the Almightie Lord  That hote colde hevie light moist and drie  hath knit by even nomber of Accord  In easie Voice began to speak and say  foules take hede of my Sentence I pray  And for your own ease in fordring of your need  as fast as I may speak I will me speed  Ye know well how on St Valentine's Day  By my Statute and through my governaunce  Ye doe these your makes and after flie away  with hem as I pricke you with Pleasaunce  Chaucer  Bird chuses its Mate From this  perhaps the youthful Part of the World hath first practised this Custom so common at this Season  In the  Trullan  Council we have Lots and Divinations forbid as being some of those Things which  provoked the LORD to anger  against King    Lib Kings Chap    Manasses  who used Lots and  Divinations  c upon which the  Scholiast  hath these Words  Can    in Syn Trul in Bals P    The Custom of drawing Lots was after this Manner on the d Day of  June  which is the Eve of St  John Baptist  Men and Women were accustomed to gather together in the Evening by the Seaside or in some certain Houses and there adorn a Girl who was her Parents firstbegotten Child af∣ter the Manner of a Bride Then they feast∣ed and leaped after the Manner of  Bacchanals  and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their Holydays After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Vessel some of the SeaWater and put also into it certain Things be∣longing to each of them Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl with the Faculty of telling future Things they would enquire with a loud Voice about the good or evil Fortune that should attend them Upon this the Girl would take out of the Vessel the first Thing that came to Hand and shew it  and give it to the Owner who upon receiv∣ing it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil Fortune that should attend him  This Custom as he tells us a little after is altogether diabolical And surely it was so being used as a presage of what was future Was the Custom of the Lots now mention'd used as among the Heathens they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation but as far as I know there is but little Credit given to them tho' that little is too much and ought to be laid aside But if the Cu∣stom was used without any Mixture or Allay of Superstition as I believe it is in some Pla∣ces yet it is often attended with great Incon∣veniences and Misfortunes with Uneasinesses to Families with Scandal and sometimes with Ruin  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XX  Festa Valentino rediit lux  Quisque sibi sociam jam legit

cui  possit blandi munuscula  Veris  BUCHANAN  BIRDS are said to choose their Mates about this Time of the Year and probably from thence came the Custom of young Persons chusing Valen∣tines or special loving Friends on that Day This is the commonly received OpinionI rather in∣cline to controvert this supposing it to be the Remains of an antient Superstition in the Church of Rome on this Day of choosing  Patrons  for the Year ensuing and that because Ghosts were thought to walk on the Night of this Day  This I find in an Observation of the th of February in the old Romish Calendar so often cited  "Manes nocte vagati creduntur"  or about this Time  Gallantry seems to have borrowed this or ra∣ther to have taken it up when Superstition at the Reformation had been compelled to let it fall  I have searched the Legend of St Valentine but  think there is no Occurrence in his Life that could have given Rise to this Ceremony  Mr Wheatley in his Illustration of the Common Prayer p tells us that St Valentine was a Man of most admirable Parts and so famous for his Love and Charity that the Custom of chusing Valentines upon his Festival which is still practised took its rise from thence I know not how my Reader will be satisfied with this learned Writer's ExplicationHe has given us no  Premises  in my Opinion from whence we can draw any such  Conclusion  Were not all the Saints supposed to be famous for their Love and Cha∣rity Surely he does not mean that we should understand the Word Love here as implying Gallantry    The learned Moresin tells  Et vere ad Valentini festum à viris habent Foeminae munera et alio temporis viris dantur In Scotia autem ad Valentini reci∣procae fuêre dationes  Moresini Deprav Rel  us that at this Festival the Men used to make the Women presents as upon another Occasion the Women used to do to the Men but that in Scotland on this Day pre∣sents were made reciprocally  Mr Gay has left us a poetical Description of some rural Ceremonies

in Scotland tells us that in February young Persons  draw Valentines  and from thence  collect  their  future Fortune  in the  nuptial State  Dr Goldsmith in his Vicar of Wakefield describing the Man∣ners of some  Rusties  tells us  they kept up the  Christmass Carrol  sent  Truelove Knots  on  Valentine Morning  eat  Pancakes  on  Shrovetide shewed  their  Wit  on the  first of April  and  religiously cracked Nuts  on  Allhallow Eve    CHAP XXI  Of  Shrovetide  what it signifies the Custom of the  Papists  at this Season that our present Customs are very unbecoming  SHROVETIDE signifieth the Time of  con∣fessing Sins  as the Word  Tide  which signifies  Time  and the  Saxon  Word  Shrive  or  Shrift  which signifies  Confession  plainly shew The Reason why this Time is so denominated is because it was set apart by the Church of  Rome  for a Time of  Shriving  or  confessing Sins  For then People were wont to confess their Sins and receive the Sacrament that they might be better prepar'd for the Religious Observation of the following Season of  Lent  Thus in the Constitutions of  Simon  of  Sudbury  Archbishop of  Canterbury  was made at  Lambeth  A D    in the second Year of  Richard  the Second in the first Year of  Urban  the fifth Pope and  Clement  the seventh AntiPope This most eloquent Man who was wise incomparably beyond the rest of the Kingdom sat about six Years and at last was beheaded at  London  by Command of the Rebels  Tyler  and  Stravo  A D  Johnson Const  I have seen in a Church at  Sudbury  in  Suffolk  a Skull which is shewn to Strangers for the Skull of this Bishop and probably it is the true one  Simon Sudbury  it is ordered  That LayMen should be ad∣monished to confess in the very Beginning of  Lent  And in  Theodolphus's Capitula  it  is ordered  That on the Week next before  Lent  every Man should go to his Shrift and his Shrift should shrive him in such a Manner as his Deeds which he had done requir'd And that he should charge all that belong to his District that if any of them have Discord with any he make Peace with him if any one will not be brought to this then he shall not shrive him but then he shall inform the Bishop that he may convert him to what is right if he be willing to belong to GOD Then all Contentions and Disputes shall cease and if there be any one of them that hath taken Offence at another then shall they be reconcil'd that they may more freely say in the LORD'S Prayer  LORD forgive us our Trespasses  c And having thus puri∣fied their Minds let them enter upon the  Holy Fast Tide  and cleanse themselves by Satisfaction against  Holy Easter  c  John∣son    Constitut  This Custom of confessing to the Priest at this Time was laid aside by our Church at the Reformation For Sins are to be confess'd to GOD alone and not to the Priest except when the Conscience cannot otherwise be quieted Then indeed the Grief is to be open∣ed to the Spiritual Guide in private  Exhort to the Com  That  by the Ministry of GOD's Word he may give the Benefit of Absolution together with ghostly Council and Advice to the quieting of the Con∣science and the avoiding of all Scruple and Doubtfulness  But how this other worse Cu∣stom came to be retain'd of indulging all Manner of Luxury and Intemperance I know nothing but that the Flesh was too powerful for the Spirit The Duties of Religion how justly soever enjoyn'd us are tamely dispensed with but what won't we rather do than give up the Pleasures of Life Surely the Church never design'd when she so justly took away the publick Confessions of this Sea∣son that Rioting and Gaming and Drunken∣ness should continue amongst us Are these a fit Preparation for so solemn a Season Will they qualifie us for the Hearing of the History of our LORD'S Passion Will they prepare us for the Reception of his Body and Blood And fit us to meet him in the Mor∣ning of the Resurrection Will they not ra∣ther speak us  Heathens  than  Christians  And lead us to Hell than on the Way to Hea∣ven Such Customs as these may in some Measure be excusable among them whose  Vid Seldon Table Talk C of Christmas  Church has too much led them into those Things but it is scandalous and sinful and  abominable in those who pretend to be the Enemies of Error and Superstition to con∣tinue the Observation of such sinful Customs  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXI  MR Bourne seems to wonder at the Luxury and Intemperance that usually prevailed at this Season Was he ignorant that this was no more than a Vestige of the Romish  Carnival  See PancakeTuesday in the Appendix  The learned Moresin  Comedit enim et bibit seque loco jocoque omnimodo adeo dedit quasi usui nunquam veniant quasi cras moritura hodie prius omnium rerum capere velit Satietatem c Deprav Rel  derives the Carnival from the Times of Gentilism he introduces Johannes Boëmus Aubanus describing it thus  Men eat and drink and abandon themselves to every Kind of sportive Foolery as if resolved to have their Fill of Pleasure before they were to  die  and  as it were  forego every Sort of Delight  Thus also Selden  What the Church debars us one Day she gives us Leave to take out in another First we  fast  and then we  feast  First there is a  Carnival  and then a  Lent  Fitzstephen informs us that antiently on ShroveTuesday the SchoolBoys used to bring  Cocks of the  Game  The learned Moresin informs us that the  Papists derived  this Custom of exhibiting  CockFights on one Day every Year  from the Athenians and from an Institution of Themistocles  Galli gal∣linacei  says he  producuntur per diem singulis annis  in  pugnam  à  Papisequis  ex veteri Atheniensium forma ducto more et Themistoclis Instituto  Cael Rhod Lib variar lect Cap Idem Pergami

Battle and claimed the runaway Cocks as their Perquisites These were called "Fugees" corrupt I suppose of RefugeesI forbear to describe the Mode of  throwing at Cocks  for as Boerhaave observes on another Occasion  To teach the Arts of Cruelty is equivalent to committing them  to their Master and to delight themselves in Cockfighting all the Forenoon Vide Stow Hence so many Welch Mains c about this Season  Since that Time a barbarous Custom hath been instituted on this Day of  throwing at Cocks  The ingenious Artist Hogarth has satirized this Barbarity in the first of the Prints called the Four Stages of Cruelty Trusler who by no Means handles his  Pen  as the Master did his  Pencil  tell us in his Description of this Plate  We have several Groups of Boys at their different barbarous Diversions One is  throwing at  a  Cock  the  universal Shrovetide Amusement  beating the harmless feathered Animal to Jelly""It has been judiciously observed he farther remarks speaking of Cats that the Concert of a  Cat's  having  nine Lives  hath cost at least nine Lives in ten of the whole Race of them scarce a Boy in the Streets but has in this Point outdone even Hercules himself who was renowned for killing a Monster that had but  three Lives  Vide Hogarth Moralized p  which we hope will be soon forgotten amongst us It is an Amusement fit only for the bloodiest Savages and not for humanized Men much less for Christians This was formerly in Use on this Day at Newcastle but is now laid aside We wish it consigned to eternal Oblivion  Mr Bourne takes no Notice of  AshWednesday  so called from a Custom observed in the antient Christian Church of Penitents expressing their Humiliation at this Time by appearing in Sack∣cloth and  Ashes  Cinere quia se conspergunt in poenitentia

impenitent Sin∣ners when the People repeat an  Amen  after each Curse  Enlightened as we think ourselves at this Day there are many who consider this  general Avowal  of the  Justice of God's Wrath

that remarkable Aera the whole Pile of Catholic Superstitions  CHAP XXII  Of PalmSunday Why so called how observed in the Popish Times What it is truely to carry Palms in our Hands on this Day  THE Sunday before  Easter  which is deno∣minated  PalmSunday  is so called  Dicitur enim dominica in ramis palmarum quod illo die rami palmarum in processionibus deportentur in signification∣em illorum quos filii  Israel  statuerunt in via Christo jam veniente  Belith    P    Cap Durand Lib    P    in Ram  be∣cause as the Ritualists say on that Day the Boughs of  PalmTrees  were wont to be carried in Procession in Imitation of those which the Children of  Israel  strawed in the Way of CHRIST  For they cut down Branches from the Trees and strawed them in the Way  which according to the Consent of Antiquity were the Branches of the  PalmTree  it being very Common in that Country and used as an Emblem of Victory And a  Doctor  of our own Church in his Discourse upon this  Fe∣stival  says  Dr  Spark  's Feasts and Fasts  From the Story as described by St  Luke  and St  Matthew  some of the an∣cient Church took Occasion as on this Day to go in Procession with  Palms  in their Hands and to denominate it  PalmSunday  But however harmless this Custom might have been in the Times of its first institution it is certain that in after Ages it sunk into Superstition and gross Idolatry Thus the  Rhemists  in their Translation of the New Te∣stament describe the Ceremony themselves  These Offices of Honour done to our  Savi∣our  extraordinarily were very acceptable And for a Memory hereof the Holy Church maketh a solemn Procession every Year upon this Day specially in our Country when it was Catholick with the Blessed Sacrament reverently carryed as it were CHRIST upon the  Ass  and strawing of Bushes and Flowers bearing of Palms setting up Boughs spread∣ing and hanging up the richest Clothes the Quire and Quiresters singing as here the Children and the People all done in a very godly Ceremony to the Honour of CHRIST and the Memory of his Triumph upon this Day The like Service and the like Duties done to him in all other solemn Processions of the Blessed Sacrament and otherwise be undoubtedly no less grateful  Dr  Fulk in Loc Mat  Fulke  upon this gives this Answer  Your  PalmSunday  Procession was horrible Idolatry and abusing of the LORD'S Insti∣tution who ordained his Supper to be eaten  and drunken not to be carryed about in Procession like a Heathenish Idol But it is pretty Sport that you make the Priests that carryeth this Idol to supply the Room of the  Ass  on which CHRIST did ride Thus you turn the Holy Mistery of CHRIST'S riding to  Jerusalem  to a  Maygame  and pa∣gent Play And yet you say such Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceeding grateful yea no less grateful than that was done by his Disciples at the Time mentioned in the Text Your Argument and Proof is none but your bare Assevera∣tions That which the Disciples did had the Warrant of the Holy Scripture but who hath regarded these Theatrical Pomps at their Hands Or what Word of GOD have you to assure you that he accepteth such Willworship Who detesteth all Wor∣ship which is according to the Doctrines and Traditions of Men and not after his own Commandment  From this superstitious and idolatrous Cus∣tom without all doubt it comes to pass that we now and then on a  PalmSunday  see the young People carrying  Branches of Palms  in their Hands which they seem fond of having that Day and which they as little regard at other Times It is true indeed it is a Relick of the ancient Superstition of the  Papists  but  as it is now intirely stript of any Superstition and is an Emblem of the Season and the Transactions of that Day so I see no harm in so innocent an Observation  But how much better would it be to car∣ry in our Hands this Day  Ramos debent fideles portare id est bona opera Opera miserecordiae sunt vestire nudos colligere hospites errantes revocare visitare infirmos c  Bed Tom    P    the  Palm of good Works  the Graces of Humility and Kindness and Charity to feed the Hungry to give drink to the Thirsty to clothe the Naked to entertain the Strangers to visit the Sick and in Prison  c  By such Actions as these should we truly carry  Palms  in our Hands by these we should truly  straw the Way  for our LORD and so follow his Steps to the  Heavenly Jerusalem  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXII  THERE can be no Doubt but that  PalmSunday  the  Dominica in Ramis Palmarum  was so called from the Palm Branches and green Boughs for∣merly distributed on that Day in Commemoration of our Lord's riding to Jerusalem  In Fuller's Church History p we read  Bearing of  Palms  on PalmSunday  is  in Memory of the receiving of Christ into Hierusalem a little before his Death  and  that we may have the same Desire to receive him into our Hearts  Provision is made for retaining the Rites used on PalmSunday and we have also the Reasons told us why they should be retained in the Convo∣cation in the Time of Henry th referred to in the Observations on the preceding Chapter  Sprigs of  Box Wood  are still used as a Substitute for  Palms  in Ro∣man Catholic CountriesStow in his Survey of London tells us  that in the Week before Easter had ye great Shewes made for the fetching in of a  twisted Tree  or  With  as they termed it out of the Woods into the King's House and the like in∣to every Man's House of Honour or Worship  This must also have been a Substitute for the Palm Thus it is still customary with our Boys to go out and gather the  Willow Flowers  or  Buds  at this TimeThese seem to have been selected because in the North they are generally the only Things at this Season in which the Power of Vegetation can be discovered  The Russians of the Greek Church have a very solemn Procession on Palm Sunday  CHAP XXIII  Of rising early on Easter Day What is meant by the Sun dancing that Morn The Antiquity of rising early on this Day the End and De∣sign of it The great Advantage of it  IT is a common Custom among the Vulgar and uneducated Part of the World to rise before the  Sun  on  Easterday  and walk into the Fields The Reason of which is to see the Sun  Dance  which they have been told from an  old Tradition  always dances as upon that Day We read indeed that the Sun once  Josh x  stood still  but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day our Saviour rose on we cannot tell It's very probable it did not because the Scriptures are silent and that it never did so since I think we may be well assur'd foras∣much as never any that we have heard of have seen any such Thing since that Time If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning it must be a  metaphorical  one that when the Morning proves clear there is a seeming Smile over the Face of Nature and Earth and Hea∣ven shew Tokens of Joy For as the Earth and her Valleys by standing thick with Corn  are said  to laugh and sing  so on Account of the Resurrection the Heavens and the Sun may be said to dance for Joy or as the Psal∣mist words it  Psal xcvi Caeliquidem digni laetentur terra autem exultet  Damasc in Dominicam Pascha P    The  Heavens may rejoyce and the Earth may be glad  There is then really speaking nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon  Easterday  but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Custom to be up early at this Holy Time And therefore  Damascen  in his  Paschal Hymn  sings  Vigilemus mane profundo pro unguenti hymnum af∣feramus Domino Christum videamus justitiae solem omni∣bus vitam exorientem  Ibid  Let us watch very early in the Morn∣ing and instead of Ointment let us bring an Hymn to our Lord and let us see our CHRIST the  Sun of Righteousness  who is the Life that riseth to all Men And indeed it is the most seasonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Resurrection and it's pleasing Cir∣cumstances For as the Place where any nota∣ble Thing has been transacted seldom or never fails to raise the Idea of the Transaction so the particular Time when it was done does generally produce the same Effect And as the Truth of the Former was the Occasion of many holy and religious Men going  Fulk Test Cont Rhem Matth Cap    in Annot  to visit  the Place of the Sepulchre and hear it as it were say what the Angel did to the Women  Come see the Place where the Lord lay  so the Truth of the Latter was the Reason why de∣vout and holy Men did in the best Ages of the Church rise early in the Morning of the Resurrection The Primitive Christians spent the Night preceeding it in Prayers and Praises till the Time of  Cockcrow  the supposed Hour of our Saviour's rising For as  Latinorum concors est sententia Christum non media nocte verum mane in aurora canentibus vice Gallorum an∣gelis devicta morte confractis portis inferi surrexisse  Du∣rant de Rit Lib    Cap    Durant  tells us it is universally assented to by the Latin Church that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death and broken the Gates of Hell he arose from the Dead not at Midnight but in the Morning at the Time of Cockcrow which not the Cocks but the Angels themselves pro∣claimed And when these Pernoctations were laid aside it was the Custom to rise early and spend the Morning in such a Manner as was suitable to the Nature of the Time The Salutation of the  Eastern  Church  Anestese  or  The LORD is risen  and the usual Answer  The LORD is risen indeed  were no doubt the com∣mon Salutation of that Morning And if this present Custom of the Vulgar has had at any Time any laudable Custom for its Original it  was no doubt this of rising early to contem∣plate the more seasonably on the Resurrection of CHRIST  And now was this the End of rising early at that Holy Time it would be very advan∣tageous but to rise with the View of the Vul∣gar is foolish and ridiculous Would we rise before the Sun and prevent the Dawn of Day our Meditations would be strong and vigorous and almost persuade us that the real Actions of that Morn were presented to our View For when at that Time all Things are husht in Silence and wrap'd in Darkness or but illu∣minated with the friendly Moon the  Devotae Christi foeminae quae illum

have our Sa∣viour in our Hearts and not fail of seeing him in his Kingdom He whom we have so carefully sought for will vouchsafe to be found of us in his Grace at the Sepulchre and in his Glory in

XXIII  MR Bourne has exhausted the Subject of this Chapter The learned Author of the Vul∣gar Errors has left us his Thoughts concerning it in the subsequent Quotation in which if the  Matter  be not found curious the  Manner  perhaps will be considered as highly so  We shall not I hope says he disparage the Resurrection of our Redeemer if we say the  Sun doth not dance  on  Easter Day  I have  heard of  when a Boy and cannot positively say whether I have not  seen  tried an ingenious Method of making an artificial  Sun Dance  on Easter Sundaya Vessel full of Water was set out in the open Air in which the reflected Sun  seemed  to  dance  from the  tremulous Motion  of the Water This looks not unlike a  Re∣lique  of  Popish Legerdemain  it reminds me of a beautiful Simile in the Loves of Medea and Jason in the Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius It is there applied to the wavering Resolves of a lovesick Maiden    c  Reflected from the Sun's far cooler Ray  As quiv'ring Beams from tossing Water play  Pour'd by some Maid into her Beachen Bowl  And ceaseless vibrate as the Swellings roll  So heav'd the Passions c  And though we would willing∣ly assent unto any  sympathetical Exultation  yet  cannot conceive therein any more than a  tro∣pical Expression  Whether any such Motion there were in that Day wherein Christ  arised  Scripture hath not revealed which hath been punctual in other Records concerning  Solary Miracles  and the  Areopagite  that was amazed at the Eclipse took no Notice of this And if metaphorical Expressions go so far we may be bold to affirm not only that  one Sun danced  but  two arose  that Day That  Light  appeared at his  Nativity  and  Darkness  at his  Death  and yet a  Light  at  both  for even that  Darkness  was a  Light  unto the Gentiles  illuminated  by that  Obscurity  That 'twas the first Time the  Sun set above  the  Horizon  That although there were  Darkness  above the  Earth  there was  Light  beneath it nor dare we say that  Hell  was  dark  if he were in it  This is a fine aenigmatical Way of  Reasoning  and from the  Turn  of his Discourse one might have asked with the  Butler  's Compliment to  Vellum  in the  Haunted House  if it were not to be too  lu∣dicrous  upon a solemn Subject  I fancy Master  Doctor  you could make a Riddle  For the  Pasche  vulgò  Paste  or  Easter Eggs  with which Children entertain themselves here in the North at this Season and of which Mr Bourne has taken no Notice see the Appendix in Verbo  Pasche  or  Paste Eggs  CHAP XXIV  Of Easter HolyDays A Time of Relaxation from Labour How observed in the dark Ages of Popery That our Customs at this Time are sprung from theirs  ON the  HolyDays of Easter  it is customary for Work to cease and Servants to be at Liberty Which is a Resemblance of the Prac∣tice of the primitive Church which set apart the whole Week after  Easter  for to praise and glorifie GOD for our SAVIOUR'S Resurrection In which  Servos autem ancillas ac omnes qui nostro servitio sunt addicti profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tem∣pore laxare debemusUt libere secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire communicare  Belith Cap    Time all servile Labour ceas'd that Servants as well as others might be present at the Devotions of the Season But other Customs so frequently observed at this Time such as  publick Showes Gamings HorseRaces  c were forbidden as being foreign to the Holiness of this Season  In after Ages when the Church fell into Corruption and the Substance of Religion de∣cay'd into the  Shadow of Ceremonies  the usual Prayers and Praises of the Season were either much neglected or but superficially observed  For  Belithus  a  Ritualist  of those Times tells us  Sunt enim nonnullae ecclesiae in quibus usitatum est ut vel etiam episcopi archiepiscopi in caenobiis cum suis ludant subditis ita ut etiam ad lusum pilae demittant c  Belith C    That it was customary in some Churches for the  Bishops  and  ArchBishops  themselves to play with the inferior  Clergy  even at  HandBall  and this also as  Durandus  witnesseth  In quibusdam locis hac die  Vid Pasch c Durand Lib    Cap    even on  EasterDay  it self This was called  Atque haec quidem Libertas ideo dicta est  Decembrica  c  Belith ibid  the Liberty of  December  because that for∣merly it was customary among the Heathens in that Month to indulge their Servants with a certain Time of Liberty when they were on the Level with their Masters and feasted and banqueted with them  Why they should play at  HandBall  at this Time rather than any other Game I have not been able to find out but I suppose it will be readily granted that this Custom of so playing was the Original of our present Recreations and Diversions on  Easter Holy Days  and in particular of playing at  HandBall for a  Vid Seld Table Talk of Christmas  TanzyCake  which at this Season is gene∣rally practised and I would hope practised with Harmlessness and Innocence For when  the common Devotions of the Day are over there is is nothing sinful in lawful Recreation But for the Governors of Churches to descend to such Childish Exercises and that even on the  Great Sunday  of the Year was not only unbecoming their Gravity and Reservedness but was also a downright breach of the fourth Commandment But these were Ages of Ig∣norance and Darkness when the World was  taught for the Doctrines of GOD the Command∣ments of Men  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXIV  Festa dies  quoties rediit  concessaque ritè  Otia  purpureoque

that falleth as soon as they mayUpon the Bridge Wharfs and Houses by the River's Side stand great numbers to see and  laugh thereat  Stow p  Mr Bourne confesses himself to be entirely igno∣rant of the Reasons why they play at  Hand Ball  Erasmus speaking of the Proverb "Mea est  Pila  " that is "I've got the  Ball  " tells us that it signifies  I have obtained the  Victory  I am Master of my Wishes  The Romanists cer∣tainly erected a  Standard  on Easter Day in Token of our  Lord's Victory  but it would perhaps be indulging Fancy too far to sup∣pose that the Bishops and Governors of Churches who used to condescend to  play at HandBall  at this Time did it in a  mystical Way  and with reference to the  triumphal Joy  of the Season Certain it is however that many of their Customs and Superstitions are founded on still more trivial Circumstances than even this imaginary Analogy  It was an antient Custom for the  Mayor Aldermen  and  Sheriff  of  Newcastle  accompanied with  great Numbers  of the  Burgesses  to go every Year at the Feasts of  Easter  and  Whitsuntide  to the  Forth  the little  Mall  of our Town with the  Maces Sword  and  Cap of Maintenance  carried before them The young People of the Town still assemble there at  this Season particularly  play at  HandBall dance  c but are no longer countenanced in their in∣nocent Festivity by the Presence of their Governors who no doubt in antient Times used to  unbend the Brow of Authority  and par∣take with their happy and contented People the puerile Pleasures of the festal Season  at this Time rather than any other GameI find  in J Boëmus Aubanus'  In  Paschate  vulgò  placentae  pinsuntur quarum una interdum duae adolescentibus una puellis altera a  ditiori  aliquo  proponun∣tur  pro quibus in  prato

was a great Concourse of People on the Oc∣casion This is a Custom by no means unlike our  Forth Meetings  on these HolidaysThe winning a  Tanzy Cake  at the Game of  HandBall  I find the following

take of the Men's in like Manner  CHAP XXV  Of  MayDay  the Custom of going to the Woods the Night before this the Practice of other Nations The Original of it the Unlawful∣ness  ON the  Calends  or the  first Day of  May commonly called  MayDay  the juvenile Part of both Sexes were wont to rise a little after Midnight and walk to some neigh∣bouring Wood accompany'd with Musick and the blowing of Horns where they break down Branches from the Trees and adorn them with  Nosegays  and  Crowns of Flowers  When this is done they return with their Booty homewards about the ri∣sing of the Sun and make their Doors and Windows to Triumph in the Flowery Spoil The afterpart of the Day is chiefly spent in dancing round a TallPoll which is called a  MayPoll  which being placed in a convenient Part of the Village stands there as it were consecrated to the  Goddess of Flowers  without the least Violation offer'd it in the whole Circle of the Year And this is not the Custom of the  British  Common People only but it is the Custom of the Generality of other Nations particularly of the  Italians  where  Polydore Virgil  tells us The  Est autem consuetudinis ut juventus promiscui sexus Laetaebunda cal  Maii  exeat in agros cantitans inde virides reportet arborum ramos eosque ante domorum fores ponat praesertim apud  Italos  c  Poly Virg    Youth of both Sexes were accustomed to go into the Fields on the Calends of  May  and bring thence the Branches of Trees singing all the Way as they came and so place them on the Doors of their Houses  Celebrabantur autem hae feriae atque ludi Lactantie teste cum omni lascivia verbis moribus pudendis ad placan∣dam deam quae floribus fructibus praeerat Nam per tu∣bam convocabantur omnis generis meretrices Unde Juvenalis  Dignissima prorsus  Florali Matrona Tuba  Ex in theatro denudatae c  Hosp de Orig Eth    This is the Relick of an ancient Custom among the Heathen who observed the four last Days of  April  and the first of  May  in Honour of the Goddess  Flora  who was ima∣gin'd the Deity presiding over the Fruit and Flowers It was observed with all Manner of Obscenity and Lewdness and the undecent Sports and Postures of naked Women who were called together with the Noise of Trum∣pets and danced before the Spectators  From this Custom of the Heathens hath ours undoubtedly come and tho' for that Reason barely it need not be laid aside yet forasmuch as many Country People are of  Opinion  Sic nos tunc eo anni tempore cum virent omnia quasi per hunc modum fructuum ubertatem ominamur ac bene precamur  Polyd Virg    That the Observation of this Ceremony is a good Omen and a Procurer of the Success of the Fruits of the Earth which is entirely a Piece of Superstition and because also much Wickedness and Debauch∣ery are committed that Night to the Scandle of whole Families and the Dishonour of Religion there is all the Reason in the World for laying it aside  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXV  IN the old Calendar of the Romish Church above cited there is the following Observa∣tion on the th of April  The Boys go out and seek  MayTrees  Maii Arbores a Pueris exquiruntur    Stow tells us in his Survey of London  The  Mayings  says Mr Strutt are in some Sort yet kept up by the MilkMaids at London who go about the Streets with their  Garlands  and Music dancing But this tracing is a very im∣perfect Shadow of the original Sports for MayPoles were set up in the Streets with various  martial  Shews Morrisdancing and other Devices with which and Revelling and good Cheer the Day was passed away At Night they rejoiced and lighted up their Bonfires English Aera Vol II p  that in the Month of May namely on  Mayday  in the  Morning every Man except impediment would walk into the sweet Meddowes and green Woods there to rejoice their Spirits with the Beauty and Savour of sweet Flowers and with the Harmony of Birds praising God in their Kinde  He quotes from Hall an Account of Henry the Eighth's  riding a Maying  from Greenwich to the high Ground of Shooter's Hill with Queen Kathe∣rine his wife accompanied with many Lords and Ladies  He further tells us  I find also that in the Month of  May  the Citizens of London of all Estates lightly in every Parish or sometimes two or three Parishes joining together had their several  Mayings  Mr Pennant tells us that on the first of May in the High∣lands of Scotland the Herdsmen of every Village hold their  Bel∣lein  a rural Sacrifice They cut a square Trench in the Ground leaving the Turf in the Middle on that they make a Fire of Wood on which they dress a large Candle of Eggs Butter Oatmeal and Milk and bring besides the Ingredients of the Caudle Plenty of Beer and Whiskey for each of the Company must contribute something The Rites begin with spilling some of the Caudle on the Ground by Way of Libation On that every one takes a Cake of Oatmeal upon which are raised nine square Knobs each de∣dicated to some particular Being the supposed Preserver of their Flocks and Herds or to some particular Animal the real Destroyer of them Each Person then turns his Face to the Fire breaks off a Knob and flinging it over his Shoulders says this I give to thee preserve thou my Horses this to thee preserve thou my Sheep and so on After that they use the same Ceremony to the noxious Animals This I give to thee O Fox spare thou my Lambs this to thee O hooded Crow this to thee O Eagle When the Ceremony is over they dine on the Caudle and after the Feast is finished what is left is hid by two Persons deputed for that Pur∣pose but on the next Sunday they reassemble and finish the Reliques of the first Entertainment  P  and did fetch in  MayPoles  with divers warlike Shews with good Archers Morrice Dancers and other Devices for Pastime all the Day long and towards the Evening they had StagePlaies and BoneFires in the Streets  And again he says  in the Reign of Henry the Sixth the Aldermen and Sheriffs of London be∣ing on  Mayday  at the Bishop of London's Wood and having there a  worshipful  Dinner for them∣selves and other Commers Lydgate the Monk of Bury sent them by a Pursivant a joyful Commendation of that Season beginning thus

the Man∣ners of Cornwal tells us  An antient Custom still retained by the Cornish is that of  decking  their  Doors  and  Porches  on the first of May with green Sycamore and Hawthorn Boughs and of planting Trees or rather Stumps of Trees be∣fore their Houses And on May Eve they from Towns make Excursions into the Country and having cut down a tall Elm brought it into Town fitted a straight and taper Pole to the End of it and painted the same erect it in the most public Places and on Holidays and Festi∣vals adorn it with Flower Garlands or Insigns and Streamers  He adds  This Usage is no∣thing more than a Gratulation of the Spring Season and every House exhibited a proper Sig∣nal of its Approach to testify their universal Joy at the Revival of Vegetation  The Author of the Pamphlet entitled  The Way to Things by Words and to Words by Things  in his Specimen of an Etimological Vocabulary considers the  MayPole  Dr Moresin gives us his Opinion concerning the Origin of this Custom in the following Words  Maïo mense exire in Agros    cantando viridem frondem reportare  quam in  Domibus    Domorum foribus  appendant aut a  Flora  lasciviae Romanae Dea aut ab Atheniensibus est  Deprav Rel Orig p  in a new and curious Light We gather from him that our An∣cestors held an anniversary Assembly on  Mayday  the  Column of the May  whence our MayPole was the great Standard of Justice in the  EyCommons  or  Fields of May  Here it was that the People if they saw Cause deposed or punished their Gover∣nors their Barons their Kings The Judge's  Bough  or  Wand  at this Time

Benefit and Advantage of them  IT was a general Custom formerly and is still observed in some  Country Parishes  to go round the  Bounds  and  Limits  of the  Parish  on one of the three Days before  Holy Thursday  or the Feast of our  LORD's Ascension  when the Minister accompany'd with his  ChurchWardens  and  Parishioners  were wont to de∣precate the Vengeance of GOD beg a Bles∣sing on the Fruits of the Earth and preserve the  Rights  and  Properties  of their  Parish  The Original of this Custom is dated from the Times of the Heathens For  Refert  Plutarchus  in Problem  Numam Popilium  cum finitimis agri terminis constituisse in ipsis finibus  Terminum  Deum quasi finium praesidem amicitioeque ac pacis custodem posuisse Festa ei dicata quae  Terminalia  nun∣cupanturquorum vice nos

the Guardian of  Fields  and  Landmarks  and the Keeper up of Friendship and Peace among Men Upon this Account the Feast called  Terminalia  was dedicated to him instead of which it is a very ancient Custom to surround  the Bounds of Parishes every Year And in∣stead of Heathenish Rites and Sacrifices to an imaginary God to offer Praises and Prayers to the true GOD the GOD of the whole Earth The Custom was the People accom∣pany'd the Bishop or some of the Clergy into the  Fields  where  Litanies  were made and the Mercy of GOD implor'd that he would avert the Evils of Plague and Pestilence that he would send them good and seasonable Weather and give them the Fruits of the Earth in due Season  The Litanies or Rogations which were  It is called  RogationWeek  because of that Prayer and Fasting that was then used for to supplicate GOD for his Blessing on the Fruits of the Earth It is also in some Places called  CrossWeek  because in ancient Times when the Priest went into the Fields the  Cross  was carried before them In the Northern Parts it is called  GangWeek  from to  gang  which in the North signifies to go  then made Use of and gave Name to the Time of  RogationWeek  were first observed by  Mamertus  Bishop of  Vienna  in the Year  Dum civitas Viennensium crebro terrae motu subrueretur bestiarum desolaretur incursu sanctus  Mamertus  ejus civi∣tatis episcopus eas

depopulated the City Not that  Litanies  and  Rogations  were not used before but that before this  Time they were not affixed to these Days And since that they have been observed of the whole Church at this Season except the Church of  Hispani  autem propter hoc quod scriptum est  non possunt filii sponsi lugere quamdiu cum illis est sponsus  infra quinquagessimam paschae recusantes jejunare

Custom of the Church not to Fast For as they themselves reason'd the Children of the  BrideChamber cannot Fast so long as the Bridegroom is with them  and therefore they held their  Rogations  after  Pentecost  What now remains among us is the Re∣lick of this antient and laudable Custom which was always observed in the old Church of  England  and has been also in some Mea∣sure since the

Maiarum  juxta ritum  Romanae  ecclesiae quae litania major apud eam vocatur Et item quoque secundum morem priorum nostrorum tertiae dies ante ascen∣tionem domini nostri in caelos cum jejunio c  Spelman Gloss    the Canons of  Cuthbert  Archbishop of  Canterbury  which were made at  Cloveshoo  in the Year it was order'd that  Litanies  that is  Rogations  should be observed of the  Clergy and all the People with great Reve∣rence on these Days  viz  the seventh of the Kalends of  May  according to the Rites of the  Church  of  Rome  who termeth this the  greater Litany  and also according to the Cu∣stom of our Forefathers on the three Days before the Ascention of our LORD into the Heavens with Fasting  c  And in the In∣junctions made in the Reign of Queen  Eliza∣beth  it is ordered  Injunct    Eliz  That the Curate at certain and convenient Places shall admo∣nish the People to give Thanks to GOD in the beholding of GOD'S Benefits for the Increase and Abundance of his Fruits upon the Face of the Earth with the Saying of the Psalm  c  at which Time the Minister shall inculcate these or such Sen∣tences  Cursed be he which translateth the Bounds and Doles of his Neighbours  Or such Orders of Prayers as shall be hereafter  Agreeable to this we read in the Life of the pious  Hooker  Walt in Vit Hookeri  That he would by no Means omit the Customary Time of Proces∣sion persuading all both Rich and Poor if they desired the Preservation of Love and their  Parish Rites and Liberties  to ac∣company him in his Perambulation and most did so in which Perambulation he  would usually Express more pleasant Dis∣course than at other Times and would then always Drop some loving and facetious Observations to be remembred against the next Year especially by the Boys and young People Still inclining them and all his present Parishioners to meekness and mutu∣al Kindnesses and Love  because Love thinks not Evil but covers a Multitude of Infirmi∣ties  We may also observe That the particular Office order'd by our Church for  RogationSunday  is exactly suited to the Nature of the Season that the three Days following are ap∣pointed Fasts by our Church and that one of our Church Homilies is composed particularly for the  Parochial Perambulation  All which shews the Custom and Intention of the Church and that the practising of it would be service∣able to the Sons of Men  Would save their Lives from Destruction and crown them with Mercy and loving Kindness would send them Springs into their Rivers and make them run among the Hills Would bring forth Grass for the Cattle and green Herb for the Service of Men  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXVI  THE Word  Parochia  or Parish antiently signi∣fied what we now call the Diocese of a Bi∣shop In the early Ages of the Christian Church as Kings founded Cathedrals so great Men found∣ed parochial Churches for the Conversion of themselves and their Dependents the Bounds of the parochial Division being commonly the same with those of the Founder's Jurisdiction Some Foundations of this Kind were as early as  Justinian  the Emperor Bede mentions them about  Before the Reign of Edward the Confessor the parochial Divisions in this Kingdom were so far advanced that every Person might be traced to the Parish to which he belongedThis appears by the Canons published in the Time of  Edgar  and  Canute  The Distinction of Parishes as they now stand appears to have been settled before the Nor∣man Conquest In Doomsday Book the Parishes agree very near to the modern Division See Collier's Eccl Hist Vol I p Camden tells us that this Kingdom was first divided into Pa∣rishes by Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury A D and counts ParishesThe Late∣ran Council made some such Division as this It compelled every Man to pay Tythes to his  Parish Priest  Men before that Time payed them to whom they pleased since then it has happend  that few if they could be excused from doing it would care to pay them at all  Blount tells us that  Rogation Week  Saxon Gangdagas i e Days of Perambulation  J Boëmus Aubanus tells us that in Franconia in his Time the following Rites were used on this Occasion some of which are still retained at Oxford  Tribus illis diebus quibus Apostolico Instituto majores lita∣niae passim per totum orbem peraguntur in plurimis Franconiae locis  multae cruces  sic enim dicunt Parochianos Caetus quibus tum sanctae Crucis Vexillum praeferri solet conveniunt In sa∣crisque aedibus non simul et unam melodiam sed singulae sin∣gulam per choros seperatim canunt et puellae adolescentes

Week Rogations and Litanies were used And Fasting or at least Abstinence then enjoined by the Church to all Persons not only for a devout Preparative to the Feasts of Christ's glorious Ascension and the Descent of the Holy Ghost shortly after but also to request and suppli∣cate the Blessing of God upon the Fruits of the EarthAnd in this Respect the Solemnization of Matrimony is forbidden from the first Day of the said Week till Trinity Sunday  The Dutch call it  Cruys Week  i e Cross Week and so it is called in some Parts of England be∣cause of old as still among Roman Catholics when the Priests went on Procession this Week the Cross was carried before them  At Oxford at this Time the little Crosses cut in the Stones of Buildings to denote the Division of the Parishes are  whited  with  Chalk  Great Numbers of Boys with pilled Willow Rods in their Hands accompany  the Minister  c in the Procession  On  Ascensionday  the Magistrates River Jury c of the Cor∣poration of Newcastle upon Tyne according to an antient Custom make their annual  Procession by Water  in their Barges visiting the Bounds of their Jurisdiction on the River to prevent Encroach∣ments cCheerful Libations

In the painted Hall at Greenwich Hospital the  Genius  of the  Tyne  is represented pouring forth his  Coal  in great Abundance There is the  Severn  with her  Lampreys  and the  Humber  with his  Pigs of Lead  which with  Thames  and the  Tyne  compose the four  great Rivers  of England    In the Inns of Court he adds it is called  Grass Week  because the Commons of that Week consist much of  Salads  hard Eggs and green Sauce upon some of the DaysThe Feast of the old Romans called  Rabigalia  and  Ambarvalia  quod Victima arva ambiret did in their heathenish Way somewhat resemble these Institutions and were kept in May in Honour of Robigus  CHAP XXVII  Of MidsummerEve Of kindling Fires their Original That this Custom formerly was su∣perstitious but now may be used with Inno∣cence  ON the  Eve of St  John Baptist commonly called  Midsummer Eve  it is usual in the most of Country Places and also here and there in  Towns and Cities  for both Old and Young to meet together and be Merry over a large Fire which is made in the open Street Over this they frequently leap and play at va∣rious Games such as Running Wrestling Dancing c But this is generally the Exer∣cise of the younger Sort for the old Ones for the most Part sit by as Spectators and enjoy themselves and their Bottle And thus they spend the Time till Midnight and some∣times till  CockCrow  Belithus  tells us  Consuetum item hac vigilia ardentes deferri faculas quod  Joannes  fuerit ardens lucerna qui domini vias praeparaverit  Belith Explicat Div Offic C    P    Durand Cap    Lib    That it was a Custom to carry lighted Torches on  MidsummerEve  as an Emblem of St  John Baptist who was a burning and a shining Light  and the Preparer  of the Way of CHRIST But if this was the Reason of this Custom formerly as it's proba∣ble it was it having been a common Thing to shadow out Times and Seasons by Em∣blems yet the Custom still continued among us was originally instituted upon another Bottom  And indeed the  Habent hoc a gentibus antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati volando per aerem frequenter in puteos fontes spermatizabant ex quo c Hoc animadvertentes medici ignes frequenter passim circa fontes fieri quaecunque magnum immundum redde∣rint fumum ibi cremari c Et quia talia hoc tempore maxime fiebant ideo hoc adhuc ab aliquibus observatur  Durand L    C    Belith in eodem Fest  Original of this Custom is  Heathenish  For in ancient Times the Dra∣gons being incited to Lust through the Heat of the Season did frequently as they flew through the Air Spermatize in the Wells and Fountains By this Means the Water became infected and the Air polluted so that who∣ever drank the Waters was either tormented with a grievous Distemper or lost his Life As soon as the Phycians perceived this th  ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains and those Things which occasioned the noisomest Smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away And forasmuch as this Custom was observed about the Time we  now celebrate St  John Baptist  's Feast it is therefore still observed among some People And agreeable to this it is that Mr  Cambden  tells us that  Barnwell  a Village near  Cam∣bridge  got its Name from the Children play∣ing about a  Well  on St  John Baptist's Eve  The Custom of kindling such Fires was severely censur'd by the Church And there∣fore in the  Council  of  Trullus  this Canon was made against it  Can    in Synod Trull ex Bals P    That if any Clergyman or Layman observed the Rite of making on Fires on the  NewMoon  which some were wont to observe and according to an old Custom to leap over them in a mad and foolish Manner he should be deposed if the Former if the Latter he should be ex∣communicated  The  Scholiast  upon this  Canon  hath these Words The  NewMoon  was always the first Day of the Month and it was Customary among the  Jews  and  Greeks  to hold then a Feast and pray that they might be lucky du∣ring the Continuance of the Month Of these it was that GOD spake by the Prophet My Soul hateth your  NewMoons  and your Sab∣baths And not only this but they also kindled Fires before their Shops and Houses and leaped over them imagining that all the  Evils which had befallen them formerly would be burnt away and that they should be more successful and lucky afterwards Now about the Sitting of this Synod there were some of the Christians who observed this Custom upon the same Accounts that the Heathens did which occasioned it's being forbid by the Council and that if a  Clergy∣man  was Guilty of it he should be deposed if a  Layman  excommunicated He also tells us that on St  John Baptist's Eve  the Vul∣gar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night and leap over them and draw Lots and Divine about their good or evil Fortune  But whatever Reason the Heathens had for kindling these Fires whether as  Duran∣dus  thinks that the lustful  Dragons  might be driven away or as the  Canon  that their evil Fortune might be burnt it is certain that the Custom was invented and practised by them and because of the Superstition attending the Observation of it was very justly forbidden by the Council And undoubtedly was the Making of such Fires now attended with any such Superstition it would be equally crimi∣nal to observe them But  Rogosquos nos Angli  Bonefires  vocamus in publica laetitia gaudiis adhibemus non obstante isto canone  Mountag P    when they are only kindled as Tokens of Joy to excite in∣nocent  Mirth and Diversion and promote  Peace and good Neighbourhood  they are law∣ful and innocent and deserve no Censure And therefore when on  MidsummerEve  St  Peter'sEve  and at some other Times we make  I suppose they were called Bonefires because that generally they were made of Bones For as  Belithus  tells us  Adversus haec ergo hujusmodi inventum est remedium ut videlicet rogus ex ossibus construeretur ita fumus hujusmodi anima∣lia fugaret  Belith in Vigil S Joan That to prevent the Infection before mentioned they were wont to make on Fires of Bones that the Smoke might drive away the Dragons  Bonefires  before Shops and Houses there would be no Harm in doing so was it not that some continue their Diversion to too late Hours and others are guilty of excessive Drinking  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXVII  STOW tells us in his Survey of London  That on the  Vigil  of  St John Baptist  every Man's  Door  The subsequent Extract from the antient Calendar of the Ro∣mish Church shews what doings there were at  Rome  on this Eve  Junius      Vigilia natalis Joannis Bap∣tistae  Aromata  dantur Vesperis  Ignes  siunt  Puella cum parvo Tympano quod Coronulam appellat  Pueri pro puellis

Bonefires  Mr Bourne supposes these to have been called  BoneFires  because they were generally made of  Bones  Stow in the cited Passage above tells us of Men's finding  Wood  or Labour towards them This seem to oppose his OpinionThe learned Dr Hickes also gives a very different Etymon He defines a BoneFire to be a Festive or triumphant Fire In the Islandic Language says he  Baal  signifies a  Burning  In the Anglo Saxon Baelfyr by a Change of Letters of the same Organ is made Baenfyr whence our  BoneFire  See that stupendous Monument of learned Industry his  Thesaurus  in the  Streets  every Man bestowing  Wood  or Labour towards them He seems to hint that these were kindled to purify the Air  Dr Moresin seems to be of Opinion that the Custom of  leaping over these Fires  is a Vestige of the  Ordeal  Flammam transiliendi  mos videtur etiam priscis Graeciae tempori∣bus usurpatus fuisse deque eo versus Sophoclis in Antigone quosdam intelligendos putant Cum enim rex Creon

Indication of Innocence There really seems to be Probability in this Con∣jecture  for not only the Young and Vigorous used to leap over them but even those of grave Cha∣racters There was an Interdiction of ecclesiastical Authority to deter  Clergymen  as Mr Bourne has told us from this  superstitious  Instance of Agility  This Author tells us of a remarkable Custom which he himself was an Eyewitness of in Scotland "  Atque hodie recens baptizatos infantes ut vidi fieri ab Anicula in Scotia olim quae sui Papatus reliquias saperet statim atque do∣mum redierint in limine oblatis

newbaptized Infant and vibrate it three or four Times gently over a Flame saying and repeating thrice  Let the Flame con∣sume thee  now  or  never  This too seems to favour his Supposition that  passing over Fires  was accounted  expiatory  There was a Feast at Athens kept by private Families called  Amphidromia  on the th Day after the Birth of the Child when it was the Custom for the  Gossips  to  run round the Fire  with the Infant in  their Arms  and then having deliver∣ed it to the Nurse they were entertained with Feasting and Dancing  Mr Borlase in his Account of Cornwall tells us  The Cornish make Bonefires in every Village on the Eve of St John Baptist's and St Peter's Days which I take to be the Remains of Part of the Druid Superstition  Gebelin before cited in his  Allegories Orientales  accounts in the following Manner for the Custom of making on  Fires on Midsummer Eve  Peuton méconnoître ici les Feux de la S Jean ces Feux sacrés allumés à minuit au moment  du Solstice  chez la plûpart des Nations anciennes modernes Cérémonie religieuse qui remonte ainsi à la plus haute Antiquité qu'  on observoit  pour la prospérité des Etats des peuples pour écarter tous les maux  L'origine de ce Feu que tant de Nations conservent encore qui se perd dans l'ántiquité est tres simple C'étoit un Feu de joie allumé au moment où l'année commençoit car la premiere de toutes les Années la plus ancienne donc on ait quelque connois∣sance s'ouvroit au mois de Juin Delà le nom même de ce mois Junior  le plus jeune qui se renouvelle  tandis que celui qui le précéde est le mois de Mai ou  Major  l'ancien aussi l'un étoit le mois des Jeunes Gens l'autre celui des Vieillards  Ces Feuxdejoie étoient accompagnés en même tems de Voeux de Sacrifices pour la prospérité des Peuples des biens de la Terre on dansoit aussi autour de ce Feu car y atil quelque Fête sans danse les plus agiles sautoient pardessus En se retirant chacun emportoit un tison plus on moins grand et le reste étoit jetté au vent afin qu'il emportât tout malheur comme il emportoit ces cendres  Lorsqu' après une longue suite d'années le Solstice n'en sit plus l'ouverture on continua cependant également l'usage des feux dans le même tems par une suite de l'habitude des idées superstitieuses qu'on y avoit attachées d'ailleurs il eût été triste d'anéantir un jour de joie dans des tems où il y en avoit peu aussi cet usage s'estil maintenu jusqu' à nous  Hist d'Hercule p  "can one says he overlook here the  St John Fires  those  sacred Fires  kindled about Midnight on the very  Moment of the Solstice  by the greatest Part both of antient and modern Nations A religious Cere∣mony which goes backwards thus to the most remote Antiquity and which was observed for the Prosperity of States and People and to dispel every Kind of Evil  The Origin of this  Fire  still retained by so many Nations and which loses itself in Antiquity is very simple It was a  Feu de joie  Fire of Joy  kindled the very Moment the Year began for the first of all Years and the most antient that we know of began at the Month of June Thence the very Name of this Month  Junior the youngest which is renewed  while that of the preceding one is May Major  the antient  Thus the one was the Month of young People the other that of old Men  These  Feux de joie  were accompanied at the same Time with Vows and Sacrifices for the Prosperity of the People and the Fruits of the Earth they  danced  also round this Fire for what Feast is there without a Dance And the most active  leap∣ed over it  Leaping over the Fires  is mentioned among the superstitious Rites used at the  Palilia  in Ovid's Fasti  Moxque per  ardentes stipulae  crepitantis  acervos  Trajicias celeri  strenua  membra pede  Lib l  Each at their Departure took away a greater or less Firebrand and the Remains were scattered to the Wind which was to drive away every Evil as it dispersed the Ashes  When after a long Train of Years the Solstice ceased to be the Beginning of them the Custom of making these Fires was still continued  at the same Time  through a Train of Use and of supersti∣tious Ideas which were annexed to it Besides it would have been a sad Thing to annihilate a Day of Joy in Times when there were but few of them Thus has the Custom been continued and handed down to us"  So far our learned and ingenious Foreigner But I by no Means acquiesce with him in thinking that the  leaping over  these  Fires  was only a Trial of Agility A great deal of Learning might be produced here further to shew that this was as much a  religious Act  as the  making them on  I have nothing to observe here concerning Mr Bourne's  lustful Dragons  their  spermatizing in the Wells or Fountains  as they flew through the Air c I find in J Boëmus Aubanus' Description of the Ceremonies of this Eve in Germany that a Species of  Fireworks  was  played off  which they who had never seen it before he says "would take to be a  Dragon of Fire flying  "  Ignis sit cui Orbiculi quidam lignei perforati imponuntur qui quum inflammantur flexilibus virgis praefixi arte et vi in aerem supra Moganum amnem excutiuntur  Draconem igneum volare  putant qui priùs non viderunt  P  This must have had some Meaning The Dragon is one of those  Shapes  which  Fear has created to itself  They who gave it  Life  have it seems furnished it also with the Feelings of animated Nature but our modern Philosophers are wiser than to attribute any noxious Qualities in Water to Dragon's Sperm  N B Stow tells us that the Rites above described were used also on the Eve of St Peter and St Paul the Apostles the th of June Dr Moresin informs us that in Scotland they used on this Night to run about on the Mountains and higher Grounds with  lighted Torches  like the Sicilian Women of old in Search of Proserpine  I have been informed that something similar to this was practised about half a Century ago in Northumberland on this Night they carried some Kind of  Firebrands  about the Fields of their respective Villages They made Encroachments on these Occasions upon the  Bonefires  of the neighbouring Towns of which they took forcibly  some of the Ashes  this they called  carrying off the  Flower  probably the  Flour  of the Wake  Moresin thinks this a Vestige of the antient  Cerealia  P  CHAP XXVIII  Of the Feast of Sheepshearing an ancient Custom  THE Feast of Sheepsheering is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy and more than ordinary Hospitality indeed it is but little observed in these Northern Parts but in the Southern it is pretty common For on the Day they begin to sheer their Sheep they provide a plentiful Dinner for the Sheerers and for their Friends who come to visit them on that Occasion a Table also if the Wea∣ther permit is spread in the open Village for the young People and Children  After what Manner soever this Custom reach'd us it is certain it may boast of great Antiquity It is mention'd in the Second Book of  Samuel  as a Feast of great Magnifi∣cence both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatness of Company No less a Person than  Absalom  the King's Son was the Master of this Feast and no less Persons were the Guests than the King's Sons the Brethren of  Absalom  nay it was a Feast that might enter∣tain the King himself or surely the King would never have been so importun'd never would have receiv'd the Compliment so kindly For 'tis said  It came to pass after two full  Years that  Absalom  had Sheepsheerers in  Baal∣hazor  which is beside  Ephraim  and  Absalom  invited all the King's Sons And  Absalom  came to the King and said Behold now thy Servant hath Sheepsheerers let the King I beseech thee and his Servants go with thy Servant And the King said Nay my Son let us not all go lest we be chargeable unto thee  Of this kind also was the Feast which  Nabal  made for his Sheerers when  David was driven  to straits in the Wilderness and sent his Servants to ask a Present of him He calls the Day it was held on a  good Day  that is a Day of plenti∣ful Eating and Drinking And therefore  Na∣bal  answer'd the Servants of  David shall I then take my Bread and my Water and my flesh that I have killed for my Sheerers and give it unto Men whom I know not whence they be  And further it is said in the same Chapter that so grand and magnificent was this Feast  that he had a Feast in his House like the Feast of a King  We find also in the Book of  Genesis  that  Laban  went to sheer his Sheep in which Time  Jacob  made his Escape which  Laban  heard not of till the third Day Of such great Antiquity then is this Custom and tho' its Antiquity is not of such force as to palliate Luxury and Profuseness in these Entertain∣ments yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmlesness of a moderate Feast upon this Oc∣casion  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXVIII  THE Author of the Convivial Antiquities tells us that the Pastoral Life was antiently ac∣counted an honourable one particularly amongst the Jews and the Romans  Apud Latinos  oves tond  re  ut et sementem facere omnino non fuit licitum priusquam  Catulatio  hoc est ex Cane sacrum fieret ut Gyraldus testatur de Diis Gentium Ex

ce∣lebrating this Feast among the latterThe wash∣ing and shearing of Sheep was attended among them with great Mirth and Festivity Indeed the Value of the Covering of this very useful Animal must have always made the  shearing Time  in all pastoral Nations a Kind of  Harvest Home  There is a beautiful Description of this Festivity in  Dyer's Fleece  at the End of the first Book  At  shearing Time  along the lively Vales  Rural Festivities are often heard  Beneath each blooming Arbor all is Joy  And lusty Merriment While on the Grass  The mingled Youth in gaudy Circles sport  We think the golden Age again return'd  And all the fabled Dryades in Dance  Leering they bound along with laughing Air  To the shrill Pipe and deep remurm'ring Cords  Of th' antient Harp or Tabor's hollow Sound  While th' Old apart upon a Bank reclin'd  Attend the tuneful Carol softly mixt  With ev'ry Murmur of the sliding Wave  And ev'ry Warble of the feather'd Choir  Music of Paradise which still is heard  When the Heart listens still the Views appear  Of the first happy Garden when Content  To Nature's flow'ry Scenes directs the Sight  With light fantastic Toe the Nymphs  Thither assembled thither ev'ry

Merriment they quaff  And cast about their Gibes and some apace  Whistle to Roundelays Their little ones  Look on delighted while the Mountain Woods  And winding Vallies with the various Notes  Of Pipe Sheep Kine and Birds and liquid Brooks  Unite their Echoes Near at Hand  The wide majestic Wave of Severn slowly rolls  Along the deep divided Glebe The Flood  And trading Bark with low contracted Sail  Linger among the Reeds and copsy Banks  To listen and to view the joyous Scene  Thus also of the  washing  and  shearing Sheep  in Thompson's Summer  In one diffusive Band  They drive the troubled Flocks by many a Dog  Compell'd to where the mazyrunning Brook  Forms a deep Pool  this  Bank abrupt and high  And  that  fair spreading in a pebbled Shore  Urg'd to the Giddy Brink much

Country People at this Time That it seems rather true that we are protected by a Num∣ber of Angels than by one particular Genius  THE Feast of this Season is celebrated in Commemoration of St  Michael  and all the Orders of Angels It is called  The Dedi∣cation of St Michael  because of a Church be∣ing dedicated to him on this Day in Mount  Garganus  At this Season of the Year it is a general Custom to elect the Governors of  Towns  and  Cities  to promote Peace among Men and guard them against Harm from their malici∣ous Fellow Creatures Whether this particu∣lar Time of the Year has been chosen for e∣lecting them because then is the Feast of An∣gels the Guardians and Protectors of Men and of their Communities and  Daniel C  Provinces is not so certain It is certainer that when ever it comes it brings into the Minds of the Peo∣ple that old Opinion of  Tutelar Angels  that every Man has his  Guardian Angel  that is one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in till his Going out of Life  who guides him through the Troubles of the World and strives as much as he can to bring him to Heaven  Now that good Angels attend good Men is without Dispute They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderness of Life and bring them to their desir'd Homes they surround them in the Seas of Afflictions and lead them to the Shores of Peace and as when the  Is∣raelites  passed through the RedSea  the Cloud became Light to them but Darkness to their Ene∣mies  so in the troublesome Seas of this Life the  Angels  are both the Guides of good Men and their Protectors from Evil from the De∣vil and his Angels And therefore the Psal∣mist says  The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivereth them and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men  They are also supposed to be that Hedge which GOD placed about  Job  which the Devil so much complains of and sure we are that when the Eyes of  Elisha  's Servant were open'd  he saw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horses of Fire round about  Eli∣sha That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture shews very clearly But that every Man has his particular  Genius  seems to be founded more upon Tradition than any Certainty from Scripture Thus the  Egyptians  believed that  every Man had three Angels attending him the  Pythagoreans  that every Man had two the  Romans  that there was a good and an evil  Genius  And hence it is that the  Roman  Poet says  Quisque suos patitur manes  every Man hath his evil  Genius  And if we may believe the Authority of  Plutarch  the evil  Genius  of  Brutus  appeared to him the Night before the Battle of  Philippi  and told him he was his evil Genius and that he would meet him there  But there are greater Authorities than these in Vindication of this Opinion  Casalion  ob∣serves it may be proved from Scripture and not only from the Tradition of the  Unicuique Deus custodem apposuit asserimus indu∣bitanter nos ex scripturas illam fidem non gentium nugibus  Cassal    P de Vet Christ Ri    Hea∣thens And of this Opinion was  Justin Mar∣tyr Theodoret  St  Basil  St  Jerome  and St  Austin  There are indeed two Places in the New Testament which have a View to this Opini∣on The first is in the th of St  Matthew  the th Verse  Take heed that ye despise not one of these little Ones For I say unto you that their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven  Now because this Place takes Notice of the Angels of these little Ones some have therefore concluded that  every Man has his good Angel at least that good Men have But now this Conclusion does not certainly follow from these Words For when it is said  their Angels  it does indeed certainly infer that the Angels do protect good Men but not that every Man has his particular Angel And hence therefore as one observes St  Chrisostom  makes use of these Words  Enteuthen delon  c it is manifest that the Saints at least if not all Men have their Angels But he does not hence conclude that every Man has one The other Place is in the  Acts of the Apostles  where it is said that when  Peter  was delivered out of Prison they would not believe the Maid it was he but said  It was his Angel  It must be own'd in∣deed from this that it seems the Opinion of those in the House that every Man had his  Guardian Angel  but this is no Proof of the Thing's being so It only proves that it was their Opinion but not that this Opinion is true The  Jews  had such a  Tradition  among them and what was here spoken was perhaps only according to that Tradition Besides we read on the contrary that sometimes one and the same Angel has been sent to different Per∣sons thus  Gabriel  was sent to  Daniel Zacha∣rias  and the blessed Virgin Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man for so was  Elisha  protected and as  we wrestle  not only against Flesh and Blood but against all the Powers of Darkness  so we have many Angels to assist and defend us I shall not dare to determine positively against this Opinion which has travelled down through so many Ages which has been held by so many wise and learned Men and which has such Scriptures brought to its Defence this I shall only say that of the two Opinions the Latter seems to be the more probable that it seems more consonant to Scripture that we are attended by a Number of Angels than by a particular  Tutelar Angel  But this I men∣tion not as necessary to be believed For I am perswaded there is no Fault in believing either the one or the other as it appears more probable For whether soever we believe we believe in the Protection of Angels and that seems to be all which the Scripture requires  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXIX  SYmmachus  against the Christians says "The divine Being has distributed various  Guardians  to CitiesAs Souls are communicated to Infants  at their Birth so particular Genii are assigned to particular Societies of Men  Moresin tells us that papal Rome in Imitation of this Tenet of Gentilism has fabricated such Kinds of  Genii  for Guardians and Defenders of Cities and PeopleThus she has assigned St Andrew to Scotland St George to England St Dennis to

presided over Athens  Bac∣chus  and  Hercules  over Boeotian Thebes  Juno  over Carthage  Venus  over Cyprus and Paphos  Apollo  over Rhodes  Mars  was the Tutelar God of Rome  In the Observations on Days in the antient Calendar of the Church of Rome I find on this Day the following  "Arx tonat in gratiam  tutelaris numinis  "  as  Neptune  of Taenarus  Diana  presided over  Crete  c c  St Peter  succeeded to  Mars  at the Revolution of the religious Creed of Rome He now presides over the  Castle of St Angelo  as  Mars  did over the antient  Capitol  It is observable in this Place how closely Popery has in this Respect copied the Heathen Mythology She has the Supreme Being for  Jupiter  and  has substituted  Angels  for  Genii  The Souls of Saints for Heroes retaining all kinds of  Daemons  Against these Pests she has carefully provided her AntidotesShe exorcises them out of Waters she rids the Air of them by ringing her hallowed Bells c  Thus the Pope like Pluto of old may be said to preside over the Infernal Regions  The Romanists in Imitation of the Heathens have assigned Tutelar Gods to each Member of the Body to Professions  Apollini et Aesculapio ejus filio datur morbo

Lucifer  is of the Infernal and as he was supposed to be the Protector of the  Jewish Church  so he is now esteemed the Guardian and Defender of the  Chri∣stian Church  A  red Velvet Buckler  is said

Country Villages are wont to ob∣serve some Sunday in a more particular Man∣ner than the other common Sundays of the Year  viz  the Sunday after the  Day of Dedi∣cation  i e the Sunday after the  Day of the Saint  to whom their Church was dedicated Then the Inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest Clothes and have open Doors and splendid Entertainments for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends who visit them on that Occasion from each neighbouring Town The Morning is spent for the most Part at Church tho' not as that Morning was wont to be spent not with the Commemoration of the  Saint or Martyr  nor the grateful Remembrance of the  Builder and Endower  The remaining Part of the Day is spent in Eating and Drinking and so is also a Day or two afterwards together with all Sorts of Rural Pastimes and Exercises such as  Dancing on the Green Wrestling Cudgelling  c  Agreeable to this we are told that former∣ly  Die Dominicâ post Encaeniam seu Festum Dedicationis cujusvis villae convenire solet in Aurorâ magna hominum Iu∣venumque multitudo canora voce  Holywakes Holywakes  Exclamando Designare  c Spelm Gloss in Verb Wak  on the Sunday after the  Encaenia  or  Feast of the Dedication  of the Church it was usual for a great Number of the Inhabitants of the Village both Grown and Young to meet together about break of Day and cry  Holywakes Holywakes  and after  Mattens  to go to Feasting and Sporting which they continu'd for two or three Days  In the  Northren Parts  the Sunday's Feast∣ing is almost lost and they observe only one other Day for the whole which among them is called the  Hopping  I suppose from the dancing and other Exercises then used The ancient Name and which is still common in the Southern Parts is the  Wake  which ac∣cording to Sir  H Spelman  are  Sunt celebritates Bacchanales sub fructuum temporibus ab occiduiis Borealibus Anglis pagatim habitae Baccha∣nales dixi ex nomine Nam Wak Sax est temulentia  Spelm ibid  Bacchanal  Feasts observed about Fruit Time and which were in Villages by Turns among the Northern and Western  English  He calls them  Bacchanals  because as he observes the  Saxon  Word  Wak  signifies Drunkenness  This Custom our Forefathers did in all Pro∣bability borrow from their Fellow Heathens  Haec eadem sunt quae apud Ethnicos Paganalia diceban∣tur  c Spelm ibid  whose  Paganalia  or  Country Feasts  were of the same Stamp with this of the  Wake  At the Conversion of the  Saxons  by  Austin the Monk  it was continu'd among the Con∣verts with some Regulations by an Order of  Pope  Gregory  the Great  to  Mellitus  the Abbot who accompany'd  Austin  in his Voyage His Words are these  Ut Die Dedicationis vel Natalitiis Sanctorum Martyr∣rum quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias quae ex Fanis commutatae sunt de ramis arborum faciant  c Bed Lib Cap    On the Day of Dedication or the BirthDay of the Holy Martyrs whose Relicks are there placed let the People make to themselves  Booths  of the Boughs of Trees round about those very Churches which had been the Temples of Idols and in a Religious way to observe a Feast that Beasts may no longer be slaughtered by way of Sacrifice to the Devil but for their own Eating and the Glory of GOD and that when they are full and satisfied they may return him Thanks who is the Giver of all good Things  This then is the Beginning of our  Country Wakes  but they continu'd not in their original Purity For the Feasting and Sporting got the ascendant of Religion and so this  Feast of De∣dication  degenerated into Drunkenness and Luxury At present there is nothing left but the very Refuse and Dregs of it Religion having not the least Share in it which till these latter Ages always had some Rioting and Feasting are now all that remain a Scan∣dal to the Feast in particular and to Christia∣nity in general  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXX  IN the Council held at Magfield in the Time of Edward the Third in the List of the principal Holydays to be observed in England are the  An∣niversaries  of the  Consecration  of  Churches  and  of the Saints  to whose Memory they are dedicated  Vide Collier's Ecclesiastical History Vol I P    The learned Mr Borlase in his Account of Cornwall speaking on this Subject tells us The Parish Feasts instituted in Commemoration of the Dedication of the parochial Churches were highly esteemed among the primitive Christians and ori∣ginally kept on the Saint's Day to whose Memory the Church was dedicated The Generosity of the Founder and Endower thereof was at the same Time celebrated and a Service composed suitable to the Occasion This is still done in the Col∣leges at Oxford to the Memory of the respective Founders On the Eve of this Day Prayers were  said and Hymns were sung all Night in the Church and from these Watchings the Festivals were stiled  Wakes  Speght in his Glossary to Chaucer gives us a curious Descrip∣tion of  Wakes  It was the Manner in Times past says he upon  Festival Evens  called  Vigiliae  for Parishioners to meet in their Church Houses or Church Yards and there to have a  drink∣ing Fit  for the TimeHere they used to end many Quarrels be∣tween Neighbour and Neighbour Hither came the Wives  in comely Manner  and they which were of the better Sort had their Mantles carried with them as well  for Shew  as to keep them from Cold at the Table These Mantles also many did use in the Church at Morrow Masses and other Times  In the Canon given under King Edgar preserved in Whe∣loc's Edition of Bede I find  decent Behaviour enjoined at  these Church Wakes  The People are commanded to pray devoutly at them and not betake themselves to drinking or Debauchery  And ƿe laeraþ {that} man aet Cyric ƿaeccan spiþe gedreoh sy georne gebidde aenige dren  ne aenig unnit þarne dreogeThis seems to oppose the Opinion of Spelman that  Wakes  are derived as Bourne c  tes  from the Saxon Word  Wak  which signifies Drunkenness  which Name still continues in many Parts of England though the Vigils have been long abolishedIt being found very incon∣venient especially in Harvest Time to observe the Parish Feast on the Saint's Day they were by the Bishop's special Authority transferred to the follow∣ing Sunday and at length in the th Year of Henry VIII it was injoined that they should be always every where celebrated on the first Sunday in October and no other Day Which Injunction was never universally complied with Custom in this Case prevailing against the Law of the Land These Feasts he continues have been much ex∣claimed against by those who do not duly distin∣guish between the Institution itself and the dege∣nerate Abuse of it  When the Order was made in and at Exeter and in Somersetshire for their Suppres∣sion both the Ministers and the People desired their Continuance not only for preserving the Me∣morial of the  Dedication of their several Churches  but for  civilizing  their  Parishioners composing Dif∣ferences  by the Mediation and Meeting of Friends  increasing of Love  and Unity by these Feasts of Charity and for the  Relief  and  Comfort  of the  Poor  Mr Strutt gives us a pertinent Quotation on this Subject from Dugdale's Warwickshire from an old MS Legend of St John the Baptist "And ye shall understond and know how the  Evyns  were furst found in old Time In the Beginning of holi Churche it was so that the Pepul cam to the Chirche with Candellys brennyng and wold  wake  and coome with Light toward to the Chirche in their Devocions and after they fell to Lecherie and Songs  Bishop Hall in his Triumphs of Rome alludes thus to these convivial Entertainments "What should I speak of our  merry Wakes  and May Games and Christmass Triumphs which you have once seen here and may see still in those under the Roman Dition in all which put together you may well say no Greek can be merrier than they" Triumph of Pleasure P  Daunces Harping Piping and also to Glotony and Sinne and so turned the  Holinesse  to  Cursydness  Wherefore holy Faders ordeined the Pepul to leve that  Waking  and to fast the  Evyn  But hit is callyd  Vigilia  that is  Waking  in Englishe and it is called  Evyn  for at  Evyn  they were wont to come to  Chirche  "  This Quotation also seems to overthrow the Ety∣mology of  Wake  given from Spelman by our Author  This ingenious Antiquary deduces the Origin of  our Fairs  from these antient  Wakes  where great Numbers attending by Degrees less Devotion and Reverence were observed till at length from  Haw∣kers  and  Pedlars  coming thither to sell their petty Wares the Merchants came and set up Stalls and Booths in the Churchyards And not only those says Spelman who lived in the Parish to which the Church belonged resorted thither but others from all the neighbouring Towns and Villages and the greater the Reputation of the Saint the greater were the Numbers that flocked together on this OccasionKeeping these  Fairs  on Sundays was justly found Fault with by the Clergy The Abbot of Ely in John's Reign preached much against such Prophanation of the Sabbath but this irreli∣gious Custom was not entirely abolished till the Reign of King Henry the Sixth See Strutt's Eng∣lish Aera Vol II p See Article  Fairs  in the Appendix  These Meetings are still kept up under the Name of  Hoppings  Hopping  is derived from the Anglo Saxon Poppan to leap or dance which Skinner deduces from the Dutch Huppe  Coxen∣dix  whence also our Hip haec enim Saltitatio quâ Corpus in altum tollitur ope robustissimorum illorum musculorum qui ossibus fe∣moris et coxendicis movendis dicati sunt praecipuè peragitur Skinner in verb Hop  Dancings  are here vulgarly called  Hops  The Word in its original Meaning is preserved in Grass  Hopper  in many of our northern Vil∣lagesWe shall hope the Rejoicings on them are still in general restrained within the Bounds of in∣nocent Festivity though it is to be feared they some∣times prove fatal to the Morals of our Swains and to the Innocence of our rustic Maids  CHAP XXXI  Of the Harvest Supper A Custom of the Hea∣thens taken from the  Jewish  Feast of Taber∣nacles  WHEN the Fruits of the Earth are ga∣thered in and laid in their proper Receptacles it is common in the most of Country Places to provide a plentiful Supper for the  HarvestMen  and the Servants of the Family which is called a  HarvestSupper  and in some Places a  MellSupper  a  ChurnSupper  c At this the Servant and his Master are alike and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom They sit at the same Table converse freely together and spend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing singing  c  without any Difference or Dis∣tinction  There  Antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud  Gentiles  quod hoc mense servi pastores ancillae quadam libertate fruerentur Et cum Dominis suis Dominarentur cum eiis facerent festa con∣vivia post Collectas Messes  Durand Rat Lib    Cap    was a Custom among the Hea∣thens much like this at the gathering in of their Harvest when Servants were indulg'd with Liberty and being on the Equality with their Masters for a certain Time  Now the Original of both these Custom is  Jewish  And therefore  Hospinian  tells us  Et pro collectis frugibus Deo gratiae agebantur Quem morem Ethnici postea ab iis mutuati sunt  Hospin de Orig Fest Jud Stukius Antiq Convival P    That the Heathens copy'd after this Custom of the  Jews  and at the End of their Harvest offer'd up their first Fruits to the Gods For the  Jews  rejoyced and feasted at the getting in of the Harvest  THEOPHYLACT  in talking of this Feast is undoubtedly mistaken when he says  Scenopegia quod celebrant in Gratiarum Actionem propter convectas Fruges in Mense  Septembri  Tunc enim gratias agebant Deo convectis omnibus fructibus  c Theo∣phylact in    Cap Joan  That the  Feast of Tabernacles  was celebrated that Thanks might be returned for the get∣ting in of the Fruits of the Earth For GOD himself tells his own People it was institu∣ted  Levit  that their Generations might know that he had made the Children of  Israel  to dwell in Booths  But however it is certainly true that it was a Time of returning Thanks to GOD for the Success of the Harvest a Time of Festivity and Joy and Gladness Thus the Scripture  Deut  Thou shalt observe the Feast of Tabernacles seven Days after thou hast gather'd in thy Corn and thy Wine And thou shalt rejoyce in thy Feast thou and thy Son and thy Daughter  and thy ManServant and thy MaidServant and the Levite the Stranger and the Father∣less and the Widow that are within thy Gates  Now as the Heathens have imitated the  Jews  in this Custom so it is not improbable that we have had it from the  Heathens  there being a very great Likeness between the Cu∣stom now and that of the Heathens formerly For  Macrobius  tells us That  Patres Familiarum frugibus fructibus jam coactis passim cum servis vescerentur cum quibus patientiam labo∣ris in colendo rure toleraverant  Macreb Saturnal Die prim Cap    the Masters of Families when they had got in their Har∣vest were wont to Feast with their Servants who had labour'd with them in Tilling the Ground Which is exactly answerable to the Custom now amongst us But whatever Truth there is in this it is certain this Custom was practised by the  Saxons  and is at least as ancient among us as their Days For among their Holydays we find a  Elstob  Append P  Week set a part at Harvest of which our  HarvestHome  and  MellSupper  in the  North  are the only Re∣mains  Here end the  Antiquitates Vulgares  OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XXXI  VACINA  aliter  Vacuna a vacando the tu∣telar Deity as it were of Rest and Ease among the Antients was the Name of the God∣dess to whom

made on the Altars of her tutelar Gods while Thanks are returned for the collected Stores and Prayers are put up for future Rest and Ease Images too of Straw or Stubble he tells us are wont to be carried about on this Occasion and in England he himself saw the Country People bringing home in a Cart I suppose from the Field a  Figure made of Corn  round which Men and Women promiscuously singing followed a Piper or a DrumA Vestage of this Custom is still preserved in some Places in the North Not Half a Century ago they used every where to  dress up something similar to the Figure above described at the End of Harvest which was called a  Kern Baby  I had this Information from an old Woman at a Village in Northum∣berlandThe Reader may perhaps smile but I am not ashamed of my Evidence In a Case of this Nature  old Women  are respectable Au∣thoritiesThis northern Word is plainly a Cor∣ruption of  Corn Baby  or  Image  as is the  Kern  or  Churn  Supper of  Corn  Supper  This as Mr Bourne tells us is called also a  MellSupper  plainly I think from the French  Mesler  to mingle or mix together the Master and Servants sitting promiscuously at the same Table All being upon an equal footing or as our Northern vulgar idiom has it "HailFellow well met"  Amell  is commonly used here for  betwixt  or  among  I find indeed that many of our Northumbrian rustic and vulgar Words are derived to us from the French Per∣haps we have not imported them from the first Market but have had them at  second Hand  from the Scots a People that in former Times were greatly connected with that Nation    This Feast is undoubtedly of the most remote Antiquity  In the antient Roman Calendar so often cited I find the fol∣lowing Observations on the eleventh of June the Harvests in Italy are much earlier than with us  The Season of Reapers and their Custom with rustic Pomp  Messorum aestas et eorum consuetudo cum agresti pompa  That Men in all Nations where Agriculture flourished should have expressed their Joy on this Occasion by some outward Ceremony has its Foundation in the Nature of Things Sowing is  Hope  Reaping  Fruition  of the  expected Good  To the Husbandman whom the Fear of Wet Blights c had harassed with great Anxiety the Completion of his Wishes could not fail of imparting an enviable gust of Delight Festivity is but the reflex of inward Joy and  it could hardly fail of being produced on this Occa∣sion which is a temporary suspension of every Care  The Respect shewn to Servants  Mr Pennant informs us that a Custom prevails in Gloucester∣shire on the Twelfthday or on the Epiphany in the Evening All the Servants of every particular Farmer assemble together in one of the Fields that has been sown with Wheat on the Border of which in the most conspicuous or most elevated Place they make twelve Fires of Straw in a Row around one of which made larger than the Rest they drink a cheerful Glass of Cyder to their Master's Health Success to the future Harvest c then returning home they feast on Cakes made of Carraways c soaked in Cy∣der which they claim as a Reward for their past Labours in sow∣ing the GrainThis he observes seems to resemble a Custom of the antient Danes who in their Addresses to their rural Deities emptied on every Invocation a Cup in Honour of them Niordi et Frejae memoria poculis recolebatur annua ut ipsis contingeret fe∣licitas

Strokes of the Sickle were timed by the Modulation of the Harvest Song in which all their Voices were unitedThey accompany in the Highlands every Action which can be done in equal Time with an appropriated Strain which has they say not much Meaning but its Effects are Regu∣larity and Chearfulness The antient proceleusmatic Song by which the Rowers of Gallies were animated may be supposed to have been of this Kind There is now an Oar Song used by the Hebridians Thus far the learned Traveller Our Sailors at New∣castle in heaving their Anchors c use a Song of this Kind  at this Season seems to have sprung from a grateful Sense of their good Services Every thing depends at this Junc∣ture upon their Labour and Dispatch  Different Places adopt different Ceremonies  There is a Sport on this Occasion in Hertford∣shire called "crying the Mare" when the Reap∣ers tie together the Tops of the  last  Blades of Corn which is  Mare  and standing at some Distance  throw their Sickles at it and he who cuts the Knot has the Prize with Acclamations and good Cheer  Mr Blount tells us farther  That after the  Knot  is  cut  then they cry with a loud Voice three Times  "I have her"  Others answer as many Times  "What have you" A Mare a Mare a Mare "Whose is she"  thrice also J B naming the Owner three Times  Whither will you send her  To Jo a Nicks naming some Neighbour who has not all his Corn

stained  with  various Colours  in  boiling  and sometimes  covered  with  Leafgold  are at  Easter  presented to Children at Newcastle and other Places in the North They ask for their  Paste Eggs  as for a  Fairing  at this Season  This Custom which had its beginning in  childish  Superstition seems to be  ending  in a Way not unsuitable to its  Origin  Paste  is plainly a Corruption of  Pasche  Coles in his Latin Dictionary renders the  Pasch  or  Easter Egg  by "  Ovum paschale croceum  seu  luteum  " It is plain from hence that he has been acquainted with the Custom of  dying  or  staining Eggs  at this Season  Ainsworth leaves out these two Epithets and calls it  singly  "Ovum paschale"He has known nothing I presume of this an∣tient Custom and has therefore omitted the "croccum" or  lu∣teum  It is in this Manner that many of our  English  Dictiona∣ries have been  improved  in modern Editions  Easter  This also is a Relique of Popish Superstition which for whatever Cause had made  Eggs  em∣blematic of the  Resurrection  as may be gathered from the subsequent Prayer  Subveniat quaesumus Domine tuae benedictionis gratia huic  Ovorum  creaturae ut cibus salubris fiat fidelibus tuis in tuarum gratiarum actione sumentibus  ob  resurrectionem Domini nostri Jesu Christi qui tecum c  p  In the Romish Beehive Fol I find the following Catalogue of popish Superstitions in which the

perhaps have thought an  Egg  no improper hierogly∣phical Representation of itThe Exclusion of a living Creature by Incubation after the vital Prin∣ciple has lain a long while dormant or extinct is a Process so truly marvellous that if it could be disbelieved would be thought by some a Thing as incredible as that the Author of  Life  should be able to reanimate the  Dead  I conjecture that the  Romanists  borrowed this Custom from the  Jews  who in celebrating their Passover set on the Table two unleavened Cakes and two Pieces of the Lamb to this they added some small Fishes because of the Leviathan  a  hard Egg  because of the Bird Ziz some Meal because of the Behemoth These three Animals being according to their Rabbinical Doctors ap∣pointed for the Feast of the Elect in the other Life  This Custom still prevails in the Greek Church Dr Chandler in his Travels in Asia Minor gives us the following Account of the Manner of cele∣brating  Easter  among the modern Greeks  The Greeks now celebrated Easter A small Bier prettily decked with Orange and Citronbuds Jasmine Flowers and Boughs was placed in the Church with a Christ crucified rudely painted on Board for the Body we saw it in the Evening and before Day Break were suddenly awakened by the blaze and crackling of a large Bonefire with singing and shouting in Honour of the ResurrectionThey  made us Presents  of  coloured Eggs  and Cakes of Easter Bread  Probably the  Cross Buns  made at present on Good Friday have been derived from these or such like  Cakes  of  Easter Bread  The Country People in the North make with a Knife many little  CrossMarks  on their Cakes before they put them into the Oven cI have no doubt but that this too trifling as the Remark may appear is a  Relique  of  Popery  Thus also persons who cannot writ  instead of signing their Names are bid to  make their Mark  which is generally done in the form of  a Cross  Easter Day  says the Abbé d' Auteroche in his Journey to Siberia is set apart for visiting in RussiaA Russian came into my Room offered me his Hand and  gave me  at the same Time  an Egg  Another succeeded he embraced me and also  gave  me  an Egg  I  gave  him in Return the  Egg  I had just received The Men go to each others Houses in the Morning and introduce them∣selves into the Houses by saying "Jesus Christ is risen" The Answer is "Yes he is risen"  The People then embrace  give each other Eggs  and drink a great deal of Brandy  This corresponds pretty much with the subse∣quent Account of far older Date which I tran∣scribe from Hakluyt's Voyages Black Letter Page  They the Russians have an Order at  Easter  which they always observe and that is this Every Year against Easter to  die  or  colour red  with  Brazzel  Brazil Wood a great Number  of Eggs  of which every Man and Woman  giveth one  unto the Priest of their Parish upon Easter Day in the Morning And moreover the Com∣mon People use to carry in their Hands one of these  red Eggs  not only upon Easter Day but also three or four Days after and  Gentlemen  and  Gentlewomen  have Eggs  gilaed  Doctor Chandler in his Travels in Greece tells us that at the City of Zante  he saw a Woman in a House with the Door open bewailing her little Son whose dead Body lay by her dressed the Hair powdered the Face painted and  bedecked  with  LeafGold  In the antient Calendar of the Romish Church to which I have so often referred I find the subsequent Observation on the th of March which I confess myself entirely at a loss how to translate  "  Ova annunciatae  ut aiunt reponuntur"  which they carry in like MannerThey use it as they say for a great Love and in  Token of  the  Resurrection  whereof they rejoice For when two Friends meet during the Easter Holydays they come and take one another by the Hand the one of them saith "The Lord or Christ is risen" The other answereth "It is so of a Truth" And then they kiss and  exchange  their  Eggs  both  Men  and  Women  continuing in Kissing four Days together  Our antient Voyage Writer means no more it should seem than that the Ceremony was kept up for four Days  Ray has preserved an old English Proverb on this Subject  "I'll warrant you for an  Egg  at  Easter  "  Of  TOBACCO  Non  fumum  ex fulgore sed ex  fumo  dare  lucem  Cogitat  HORAT  A  Foreign Weed  which has made so many  Eng∣lishmen  especially of the common Sort be∣come its  Slaves  must not be omitted in our Catalogue of popular Antiquities  Captain R Greenfield and Sir Francis Drake are said to have been the first who brought Tobacco into this Kingdom about the Year during the Reign of ElizabethA pleasant Kind of Tale is given us in the Athenian Oracle by Way of ac∣counting for the frequent Use and Continuance of taking it  When the Christians first discovered America the Devil was afraid of losing his hold of the People there by the Appearance of Christianity He is reported to have told some Indians of his Acquaintance that he had found a Way to be revenged upon the Christians for beating up his Quarters for he would teach them to take  Tobacco to which when they had once tasted it they should be perpetual Slaves  Our British Solomon James the Ist who was a great Opponent of the Devil and even wrote a Book against Witchcraft made a formidable At∣tack also upon this "Invention of Satan" in a  learned  Performance which he called a  Counterblaste to Tobacco  His Majesty in the Course of his Work informs us  that some of the Gentry of the Land bestowed at that Time  three  some  Four Hundred Pounds a Yeere  upon this  precious stink  An incredible Sum especially when we consider the Value of Money in his Time They must not have been  Sterling  but  Scotch  Pounds  The following extraordinary Account of a Buckinghamshire Par∣son who  abandonned  himself to the use of Tobacco is worth quot∣ing It may be found in Lilly's History of his Life and Times p  In this Year also William Bredon Parson or Vicar of Thorn∣ton in Bucks was living a  profound  Divine but absolutely the most  polite  Person for  Nativities  in that Age strictly adhering to Ptolomy which he  well understood  he had a Hand in composing Sir Christopher Heydon's defence of Judicial Astrology being at that Time his Chaplain he was so given over to Tobacco and Drink that when he had  no  Tobacco and I suppose  too much  Drink he would  cut  the  BellRopes  and  smoke  them    It is printed in the Edi∣tion of his Work by Barker Bill London  He concludes this  bitter Blast  How widely different the Strains of the subsequent Parody  Little

Nose harmful  to the  Brain dangerous  to the  Lungs  and in the  black stinking Fume  thereof neerest resembling the  horrible Stygian Smoke  of the  Pit that is bottomless  If even this small Specimen of our  learned  Monarch's Oratory which seems well adapted to the Understanding of old Women does not pre∣vail upon them all to break in Pieces their Tobac∣co Pipes and forego  Smoking  it will perhaps be impossible to say what can  The Subject as his Majesty well observes is  Smoke  and no doubt many of his Readers will think  his  Arguments but the  Fumes  of an idle Brain and it may be added too of an empty Head  Of  WITCHES  Devovet absentes simulachraque cerea  fingit  Et miserum  tenues  in  jecur urget acus  OVID  WITCH  is derived from the Dutch  Witchelen  which signifies  whinnying  and neighing like a Horse In a secondary Sense also to  foretell  and  prophecy  because the Germans as Tacitus informs us used to divine and foretell Things to come by the  whinnying  and  neighing  of  their Horses  There is a superstitious Custom among some People of  nailing HorseShoes  on the  Threshold  to keep out Witches  To break the  EggShell  after the Meat is out is a Relique of Superstition thus mentioned in Pliny  huc pertinet  Ovorum  ut exorbuerit quisque  calices  protinus  frangi  aut eosdem  cocleari∣bus perforari  Dr Browne tells us that the Intent of this was to prevent Witch∣craft for lest Witches should draw or prick their Names therein and veneficiously mischief their Persons they broke the Shell as Dalecampius has observed Vide Vulg Errors  Mr Pennant tells us in his Tour in Scotland that the Farmers carefully preserve their Cattle against Witchcraft by placing Boughs of the  Mountain Ash  and  Honey Suckle  in their  CowHouses  on the d of MayThey hope to preserve the Milk of their Cows and their Wives from Miscarriage by  tying red Threads about them  they  bleed  the supposed  Witch  to preserve themselves from her Charms  His very Words are  hinnitu    fremitu  Perkins defines Witchcraft to be an Art serving for the working of Wonders by the Assistance of the Devil  so far  as  God  will  permit  Delrio defines it to be an Art in which by the Power of a Con∣tract entered into with the Devil some Wonders are wrought which pass the common Understanding of Men Lib cap de Mag disq Vide Blount  Witchcraft in  modern  Estimation is a Kind of Sorcery especially in Women in which it is ridi∣culously supposed that an  old Woman  by entering into a Contract with the Devil is enabled in many Instances to change the Course of Nature to raise Winds perform Actions that require more than human Strength and to afflict those that offend her with the sharpest Pains c  In those Times of more than Egyptian Dark∣ness  He tells us also that the last Instance of these frantic Exe∣cutions for Witchcraft in the North of Scotland was in June as that in the South was at Paisly in where among others a Woman young and handsome suffered and with a reply to her enquiring Friends worthy a Roman Matron  Being asked why she did not make a better Defence on her Trial she answered "My Persecutors have destroyed my Honour and my Life is not now worth the Pains of defending" He goes on "The last Instance of national Credulity on this Head was the Story of the Witches of Thurso who tormenting for a long Time an honest Fellow under the usual form of Cats at last provoked him so that one Night he put them to flight with his broad Sword and cut off the Leg of one less nimble than the Rest On his taking it up to his Amazement he found it belonged to a Female of his own Species and next Morning discovered the Owner an old Hag with only the companion Leg to this"  But these Relations of almost obsolete Superstitions must never be thought a Reflection on this Country as long as any Memory remains of the tragical End of the Poor People at  Tring  who within a few Miles of our Capital itself in fell a Sacrifice to the Belief of the Common People in Witches or of that ridiculous Imposture in the Capital itself in of the Cocklane Ghost which found credit with all Ranks of People Note p  He farther observes that at Edinburgh there is still shewn a deep and wide Hollow beneath Calton Hill the Place where those imaginary Criminals Witches and Sorcerers were burnt in less enlightened Times  The ingenious Artist Hogarth in his  Medley  represents with great Spirit of Satire a  Witch sucked by  a  Cat  and flying on a  Broomstick  It being said as Trusler remarks that the  Familiar  with whom a  Witch converses sucks  her  right Breast  in Shape of a  little dun Cat  as smooth as a Mole which when it has sucked the  Witch  is in a  Kind  of  Trance  Vide Hogarth Moralized p  when Ignorance and Superstition overspread  the World many severe Laws were made against Witches by which to the Disgrace of Humanity great Numbers of innocent Persons distressed with Poverty and Age were brought to violent and untimely Ends  The WitchAct a Disgrace to the Code of Eng∣lish Laws was not repealed till the Year  Lord Verulam that Sun of Science that rose upon our Island and dispelled an hereditary Night of Ignorance and Superstition gives us the fol∣lowing Reflections on Witches in the th Century of his Natural History They form a fine Contrast to the narrow and bigotted Ideas of the  royal Author  of the Demonology  "Men may not too rashly believe the Confession of Witches nor yet the Evidence against them For the Witches themselves are  imaginative  and believe oftentimes they do that which they do not  And People are credulous in that Point and ready to impute Accidents and natural Operations to WitchcraftIt is worthy the observing that both in antient and late Times as in the Thessalian Witches and the Meetings of Witches that have been recorded by so many  late  Confessions the great Wonders which they tell of  carrying  in the  Aire transforming themselves  into  other Bodies  c are still reported to be wrought not by  Incantation  or  Ceremonies  but by  Ointments  and  anointing  themselves  all over  This may justly move a Man to think that these Fables are the Effects of  Ima∣gination  for it is certain that Ointments do all if they be laid on any Thing thick by stopping of the Pores shut in the Vapours and send them to the Head extremely and for the particular Ingre∣dients of those magical Ointments it is like they are opiate and soporiferous For anointing of the Forehead Neck Feet Backbone we know is used for procuring dead Sleeps And if any Man say that this Effect would be better done by inward Potions Answer may be made that the Medi∣cines which go to the  Ointments  are so strong that if they were used  inwards  they would kill those that use them and therefore they work potently though  outwards  " He tells us elsewhere  "The Ointment that Witches use is reported to be made of the  Fat  of  Children  digged out of their  Graves  of the  Juices  of  Smallage

about the Time of  Lord Verulam  no small Stir concerning WitchcraftBen Johnson says Dr Percy has left us a  Witch Song  which contains an Extract from the various Incantations  classic Antiquity Some learned WiseAcres had just before  themselves on this Subject with our British Solomon James  at their HeadAnd these had so ransacked all Writers antient  d modern and so blended and kneaded together the several Su∣  erstitions of different Times and Nations that those of genuine  nglish Growth could no longer be traced out and distinguished  It was a supposed Remedy against  Witchcraft  to put some of the  witched Person's  Water  with a Quantity of  Pins Needles  and  ails  into a Bottle cork them up and set them before the Fire  order to confine the Spirit but this sometimes did not prove  fficient as it would often force the Cork out with a loud Noise  ke that of a Pistol and cast the Contents of the Bottle to a consi∣  rable Height  Bewitched Persons are said to fall frequently into

which the Devil is said to appear in the Shape of a Goat about which they make several Dances and magic Ceremonies In order to prepare themselves for this meeting they take several soporific Drugs after which they are fancied to fly up the Chim∣ney and to be spirited or carried through the Air riding on a  Switch  to their Sabbath Assembly Hence the Idea of  Witches  on  Broomsticks  c  The Author of the  Gentle Shepherd  a beautiful  Pastoral  in the  ch Language that equals perhaps the Idyllia of Theocritus has made great Use of this SuperstitionHe introduces a Clo  telling the Powers of a  Witch  in the following Words  She can o'ercast the Night and cloud the Moon  And mak the Deils obedient to her crune  At Midnight Hours o'er the Kirkyards she raves  And howks  unchristen'd

on which to have displayed his inimitable  lent for Criticism  A  Cat  too is the  "sine qua non"  of a Witch These Animals were antiently revered as Emblem of the Moon and among the Egyptians we  on that Account so highly honoured as to r  ¦ceive Sacrifices and Devotions and had state  Temples erected to their Honour It is said tha  in whatever House a Cat died all the Family shaved their Eyebrows Herodotus and Dio∣dorus Siculus relate that a Roman happening accidentally to kill a Cat the Mob immediately gathered about the House where he was and neither the Entreaties of some principal Men sent by the King nor the Fear of the Romans with whom they were then negotiating a Peace could save the Man's Life Vide  Bailey  Hence no doubt they have been taken and adopted into the Species of Superstition under Consideration  Mr Strutt in his Description of the  Ordeals  under the Saxons tells us  That the second Kind of Ordeal by Water was to thrust the ac∣cused into a deep Water where if he struggled in the least to keep himself on the Surface he was accounted Guilty but if he remained on the Top of the Water without Motion he was acquit∣ted with Honour Hence he observes without doubt came the long continued Custom of  swim∣ming  People suspected of WitchcraftThere are  also he observes farther the faint traces of these antient Customs in another superstitious Method of proving a Witch it was done by weighing the suspected Party against the Church Bible which if they outweighed they were innocent but on the contrary if the Bible proved the heaviest they were instantly con∣demnedHowever absurd and foolish these superstitious Customs may seem to the present Age little more he observes than a Century ago there were several unhappy Wretches not only apprehended but also cruelly burnt alive for Witchcraft on very little better Evidence than the above ridiculous Trials Several great and learned Men have also taken vast Pains to convince the doubting Age of the real Existence of Witches and the Justness of their Execu∣tions But so very unbelieving we are grown at present in these and such like Stories as to con∣sider them only as the idle Phantoms of a

in Franconia in the  Middle  of  Lent  in which he mentions  Peas  which were eaten at that Time  In medio quadragesimae quo quidem Tempore ad laetitiam nos Ec∣clesia adhortatur Iuventus in patriâ mea

repellitur  Which may be thus englished  In the Middle of Lent the Youth in my Country make an  Image of Straw  in the Form of  Death  as it is usually depicted They  suspend  it on a  Pole  and carry it with Acclamations into the  neighbouring Villages  Some receive this Pageant kindly and after a Re∣freshment of  Milk Peas  and  dryed Pears  which we  commonly eat at that Time  it is sent home again Others thinking it a Presage of something bad Death for instance forcibly drive it away from their respective Districts  The fourth Sunday in Lent says Wheatly on the Common Prayer is generally called  Midlent  though Bishop Sparrow and some others term it  Dominica Refectionis  the Sunday of Refreshment the Reason perhaps is because the Gospel for the Day treats of our Saviour's feeding miraculously Five Thousand or else from the first Lesson in the Morning which gives us the Story of Joseph's entertaining his BrethrenHe is of Opinion that the Appointment of these Scriptures upon this Day might probably give the first Rise to a Custom still retained in many Parts of England and well known by the Name of  Midlenting or Mothering  Bailey supposes  Mothering  a Custom still retained in many Places of England of visiting Parents on MidLent Sunday to have been so called from the Respect paid in old Time to the MotherChurch It being the Custom for People in Popish Times to visit their MotherChurch on MidLent Sunday and to make their Of∣ferings at the high Altar  is preserved in the subsequent Account of an obsolete Custom at Marriages in  this Kingdom  According to the Use of the Church of Sarum when there was a Marriage before Mass the Parties kneeled together and had a fine Linen Cloth called the  CareCloth  laid over their Heads during the Time of Mass till they received the Benediction and then were dismissed  Vide Blount in Verbo  Dr Chandler in his Travels in Greece tells us that he was at a  Funeral Entertainment  amongst the modern Greeks where with

and lawless Festivity was taken up P  was used in the Greek Church from whence we have probably borrowed it with Pasche Eggs and other suchlike Ceremonies  The Russes as Hakluyt tells us begin their Lent always eight Weeks before  Easter the first Week they eat Eggs Milk Cheese and Butter and make  great Cheer  with  Pancakes  and such other Things  The Custom of frying Pancakes in  turning of

likely to last another Century  The Apprentices whose particular Holiday this Day is now called and who are on several Accounts so much interested in the Observation of it ought with that watchful

p  Token  and  Pledge  of Matrimony  preferably to any other Finger not as Levinus Lemnius in his Occult Miracles of Nature tells us because there is a  Nerve  Mr Wheatly tells us that the Rubrick of the  Salisbury Manual  has these Words  It is because from thence there pro∣ceeds a particular Vein to the Heart  This indeed he adds is now contradicted by Experience but several eminent Authors as well Gentiles as Christians as well Physicians as Divines were formerly of this Opinion and therefore they thought this Finger the properest to bear this Pledge of Love that from thence it might be conveyed as it were to the Heart Illust Comm Prayer p  as some have thought but because a  small Artery  runs from the  Heart  to this  Finger  the Motion of which in parturient Women c may be perceived by the Touch of the Finger Index  This Opinion has been exploded by later Physi∣cians but it was from hence that Antiquity judg∣ed it worthy and selected it to be adorned with the  Circlet  of  Gold  They called it also the  Medical Finger  and were so superstitious as to mix up their Medicines and Potions with it  Some of the common Ceremonies at Marriages seem naturally to fall under this Class of popular Antiquities  I have received from those who have been present at them the following Account of the Customs used at  vulgar Northern Weddings  about Half a Century ago  The Author

Occasion whosoever was so fortunate as to tear them thus off from her Legs bore them about the Church in Triumph  It is still usual for the young Men present to  salute  the  Bride  immediately after

derives this Word from the French  Pleige  a Surety or GageTo pledge one drinking is generally thought to have had its Origin thus When the Danes bore sway in this Land if a Native drank they would sometimes stab him with a Dagger or Knife hereupon Peo∣ple would not drink in Company  There was an antient Custom called a  BidAle  or  BidderAle  from the Saxon  Bidden  to pray or supplicate when any honest Man decayed in his Estate was set up again by the liberal Benevolence and Contributions of Friends at a Feast to which those Friends were bid or invited It was most used in the West of England and in some Counties called a  Help Ale  Such Instances of Benevolence are retained in the NorthAt the Christening Entertainments of many of the poor People who are unfortunate enough to provide more  Mouths  than they find  Meat  for great Collections are made oftentimes by the Guests and such as will far more than defray the Expences of the Feast of which they have been partaking  unless some one present would be their  Pledge  or Surety that they should receive no Hurt whilst they were in their Draught  Others affirm the true sense of the Word to be this That if the Person drank unto was not disposed to drink himself he would put another for a Pledge to do it for him otherwise the Party who began would take it ill  Mr Strutt confirms the former Opinion in the following Words The old Manner of Pledging each other when they drank  Such great Drinkers says he also were the Danes who were in England in the Time of  Edgar  and so much did their bad Examples prevail with the English that he by the Advice of Dunstan ArchBishop of Canterbury put down many AleHouses suffering only one to be in a Village or small Town And he also further or∣dained that  Pins  or  Nails  should be fastened into the  drinking Cups  and  Horns at stated distances  and  whosoever  should  drink be∣yond those Marks at one Draught  should be obnoxious to a severe Punishment This was to prevent the pernicious Custom of Drink∣ing  Ibid  Bumpers  are of great Antiquity Thus Paulus Warnefridus is cited in Du Cange's Glossary telling us in lib de gestis Langobard Cap  Cumque ii qui

InebriationIt is a striking Instance of  the doing  ill  as we say that  good  may come of it  It  may  happen that Inebriation by causing Vomiting may cleanse the Stomack c but it seems a very dangerous Kind of Dose and of which the  "repetatur hausius"  too quickly repeat∣ed will evince that Men may pervert that which Nature intend∣ed for a  Cordial  into the most baneful of all  Poisons  It has been vulgarly called "giving a Fillip to Nature"  Dr Browne is of Opinion that the human Faces described in AleHouse  Signs  in Coats of Arms c for the  Sun  and  Moon  are Reliques of Paganism

he would held up his Knife or Sword to guard him whilst he drank for while a Man is drinking he necessarily is in an unguarded Posture exposed to the treacherous Stroke of some hidden or secret Enemy  This Custom as it is said first took rise from the Death of young King Edward called the Martyr Son to Edgar who was by the Contri∣vance of Elfrida his StepMother traiterously stabbed in the Back as he was drinking  Mr Strutt's Authority here is William of Malms∣bury and he observes from the Delineation he gives and it must be observed that his  Plates  being  Copies  from antient illuminated  Manuscripts  are of unquestionable Authority that it seems perfectly well to agree with the reported Custom the middle Figure is addressing himself to his Companion who seems to tell him that he pledges him holding up his Knife in Token of his readiness to assist and protect him Vol st p of Manners and Customs Anglo Saxon Aera  The antient Greeks and Romans used at their Meals to  make Libations pour out  and even  drink Wine  in Honour of the GodsThe classical Writings abound with Proofs of this  The Grecian Poets and Historians as well as the Roman Writers have transmitted to us Ac∣counts also of the grateful Custom of  drinking to the Health  of our  Benefactors  and of our  Acquaintance    Pro te  fortissime vota  Publica suscipimus  Bacchi tibi  sumimus  haustus  The Men of Gallantry among the Romans used to take off as many Glasses to their Mistresses as there were Letters in the Name of each according to Martial  How exceedingly similar to our modern Custom of saying to  each  of the Company  in turn  "give us a Lady to toast" is the following  Da puere ab summo age tu interibi ab infimo  da Suavium  Plauti Asinaria  Our Word  Tost  or  Toast  signifying to name or begin a new Health concerning the Etymology of which all our Dictionary Writers are silent is a  Cant Word  I find it in the  canting Voca∣bulary  Who tosts now Who christens the Health An old  Tost  a  pert pleasant  old  FellowTossPot  quaere from hence  I find the subsequent Dissuasive from Drunkenness a Vice to which it must be confessed the  drinking of Healths  does but too naturally tend in Ch Johnson's  Wife's Relief  Oh when we swallow down  Intoxicating Wine we drink Damnation  Naked we stand the Sport of mocking Fiends  Who grin to see our noble Nature vanquish'd  Our

appears to have been intoxicated with the Fumes of a most fanatical Spirit and whom all Anticyra could not it should seem have reduced to a State of  mental Sobriety  concludes his Address to the

this Night with young People in the North to  dive  for Apples catch at them when stuck on at one End of a Kind of hanging Beam at the other Extremity of which is fixed a lighted Candle and that with their Mouths only having their Hands tied behind their Backs with many other Fooleries  Nuts  In the Marriage Ceremonies amongst the antient Romans the Bridegroom threw  Nuts  about the Room for the Boys to scramble The Epithalamiums in the Classics prove this They were supposed to do this in Token of leaving childish Diversions "Quanquam Plinius lib cap causas alias adfert quam ob rem Nuces in

religious Use was made of them and they were in great Estimation  Nuces  in pretio et  religiosae  and Apples chiefly compose the Enter∣tainment and from the Custom of  flinging the for∣mer  into the Fire  it has doubtless had its vulgar Name of NutcrackNight The catching at the  Apple  and  Candle  at least puts one in mind of the antient English Game of the Quintain which is now almost forgotten

Cabbages blindfold on Allhallow Even and like the English  fling Nuts into the Fire  This last Custom is beautifully described by Gay in his  Spell  Two hazel Nuts I threw into the Flame  And to each

Harvest Home Rejoicing  A Solemnity was kept says he on the Eve of the first of November as a Thanksgiving for the safe Ingathering of the Produce of the Fields This I am told but have not seen it is

Tolfraedr Tolfraed  or  Tolfraet  whence our  Twelve  which made  Ten  signify  Twelve  a Hundred a Hundred and Twenty a Thousand a Thousand Two Hun∣dred c  Of which Method of Computation the following is the Cause The Nations abovenamed had two  Decads  or  Tens  a  less  which they used in common with other Nations consisting of  Ten  Units and a  greater  containing Twelve  Tolf  Units  Hence by the Addition of the Word  Tolfraedr  or  Tolfroed  the  Hundred  contained not  Ten  Times Ten but  Ten  Times  Twelve  that is a Hundred and Twenty  The Doctor observes that this  Tolfraedic  for I am obliged to make a new Word in translating him Mode of Computation by the  greater  Decads or  Tens  which contain Twelve Units is still retained amongst us in reckoning certain Things by the

the antient  Runic Inscriptions are in the Form of a  Knot  See Hicke's Thesaurus  In his autem Monumentis ut et in id genus fere omnibus In∣scriptionum Runae in  nodis  sive  Gyris nodorum  insculptae leguntur propterea quod apud Veteres Septentrionales gentes  Nodus Amoris fidei Amicitiae symbolum  fuisse videtur ut quod insolubilem pieta∣tis et Affectus Nexum significavit Hinc apud

who still retain in a great Measure the Lan∣guage and Manners of the antient Danes that curious Kind of Knot a mutual Present be∣tween the Lover and his Mistress which being considered as the Emblem of plighted Fidelity is therefore called a  TrueLove Knot  The Epithet is not derived as one would naturally suppose it to be from the Words  True  and  Love  but from the Danish Verb  Trulofa  Thus also in the Islandic GospelsIn Matthew Chap st is the following Passage which confirms beyond the Possibility of a Doubt the Sense here given  til einrar Meyar er  Trulofad  var einum Manne c  i e To a Virgin  espoused  that is who was pro∣mised or had engaged herself to a Man c  fidem do I plight my Faith  It is undoubtedly from hence that the  BrideFavours  or the  TopKnots  at  Marriages  which were considered as Emblems of the  Ties  of Duty and Affection between the Bride and her Spouse have been derived  Mr Gay in his Pastoral entitled the  Spell  thus beautifully describes the rustic Manner of knitting this  TrueLove Knot  As Lubberkin once slept beneath a Tree  I twitched his dangling Garter from his Knee  He wist not when the hempen String I drew  Now  mine  I quickly doff of Inkle Blue  Together fast I tie the Garters twain  And while I knit the Knot repeat this Strain  Three Times a TrueLove's Knot I tye secure  Firm be the Knot firm may his Love endure  Of the Custom of  BLESSING PERSONS  when they  SNEEZE  THE very learned Author of the Vulgar Er∣rors has left us a great Deal on this Sub∣jectIt is generally believed that the Custom of  Saluting  or  Blessing  upon that Motion derives its Origin from a Disease wherein such as  sneezed  diedCarolus Sigonius in his History of Italy mentions a Pestilence in the Time of Gregory the Great that proved mortal to such as  sneezed  The Custom has an elder Aera Apulcius men∣tions it Years beforePliny  It is said that Tiberius the Emperor otherwise a very four Man would perform this Rite most punctually to others and expect the same from others to himself  also in the Problem "Cur sternutantes salutantur" Petro∣nius Arbiter  Petronius Arbiter who lived before them both has these Words Gyton collectione spiritûs plenus ter continuò ita ster∣nutavit ut grabatum concuteret ad quem motum Eumolpus con∣versus  Salvere Gytona  jubet  too describes itCaelius Rhodigi∣nus  has an Example of it among the Greeks in the Time of  Cyrus  the Younger  When consulting about their retreat it chanced that one of them sneezed at the Noise whereof the Rest of the Soldiers called upon  Jupiter Soler  In the Greek Anthology  Non potis est Proclus digitis emungere Nasum  Namque est pro Nasi mole pusilla manus  Non vucat ille Jovem sternutans quippe nec audit  Sternutamentum tam procul aure sonat  it is alluded to in an EpigramIt is received at this Day in the remotest Parts of Africa  So we read in Codignus that upon a Sneeze of the Emperor of Monomotapha there passed Acclamations successively through the CityAnd as remarkable an Example there is of the same Custom in the remotest Parts of the East in the Travels of Pinto    The History of it will run much higher if we take in the Rabbinical Account  That sneezing was a mortal Sign even from the first Man until it was taken off by the special Supplication of Jacob From whence as a thankful Acknowledgement this Salutation first be∣gan and was after continued by the Expression of  Tobim Chaiim  or vita bona by standers by upon all Occasions of  sneezing  Buxtorf Lex Chald    Dr Browne himself supposes that the Ground of this antient Custom was the Opinion the An∣tients held of Sternutation which they generally conceived to be a  good Sign  or a  bad  and so upon this Motion accordingly used a  Salve  or  as a Gratulation for the one and a De∣precation from the other  He then gives their  Physical  Sneezing  being properly a Motion of the Brain suddenly expel∣ling through the Nostrils what is offensive to it it cannot but afford some Evidence of its Vigour and therefore saith Aristotle they that hear it "  " honour it as something sacred and a Sign of Sanity in the diviner Part and this he illus∣trates from the Practice of Physicians who in Persons near Death use  Sternutatories  Medicines to provoke  sneezing  when if the Faculty arise and Sternutation ensues they conceive Hopes of Life and  with Gratulation  receive the  Signs  of Safety  Notions  of it Hippocrates says that sneezing cures the Hiccup is profitable to parturient Women in Lethargies  Apoplexies Catalepsies and Coma's It is bad and pernicious in Diseases of the Chest in the Beginning of Catarrhs in new and tender Con∣ceptions for then it endangers Abortion  To these succeed their  superstitious  and  augurial  ones St Austin tells us that the Ancients were wont to go to Bed again if they  sneezed  while they put on their  Shoe  Aristotle has a Problem "why sneezing from Noon to Midnight was  good  but from Night to Noon  unlucky  " Eusta∣thius upon Homer observes that sneezing to the  Left  was  unlucky  but  prosperous  to the  Right  See Plutarch in the Life of Themistocles  When Themistocles sacrificed in his Galley before the Battle of Xerxes and one of the Assistants upon the  right Hand sneezed  Euphrantides the Southsayer presaged the Victory of the Greeks and the Overthrow of the Persians    I shall give the whole of his Conclusion "Thus we may perceive the Custom to be more antient than is commonly thoughtand these Opinions hereof in all Ages not any one Disease to have been the Occasion of this salute and Deprecation arising at first from this vehement and affrighting Motion of the Brain from whence some finding dependant Effects to ensue Others ascribing hereto as a Cause what perhaps but  casually  or  inconnex∣edly  succeeded they might proceed into forms of Speeches  felicitating  the  good  and  deprecating  the  evil  to  follow  "  Of  ROYALOAK DAY  ON the th of May  May the th says the

Hist of Poetry p there is a Note which contains a great deal of Learning on this Subject the subsequent Extracts will requite the Pains of Perusal and throw no small Light upon this antient Kind of  Mart  "Before flourishing Towns he tells us were established and the Necessaries or Ornaments of Life from the Convenience of Communication and the increase of Provincial Civility could be procured in

We also have heard of a  Fair  upon the Thames in a very hard Frost  To these as to one universal Mart the People re∣sorted periodically and supplied most of their Wants for the ensuing Year  The Display of Merchandize and the Conflux of Customers at these principal and almost only Emporia of domestic Commerce were prodigious and they were therefore often held on open and extensive Plains Thus at Newcastle on our Town Moor the  Cowbill    One of the chief of them was that of St Giles's Hill or Down near Winchester The Conqueror instituted and gave it as a Kind of Revenue to the Bishop of Winchester It was at first for three Days but afterwards by Henry III pro∣longed to sixteen DaysIts Jurisdiction extended seven Miles round and comprehended even South∣ampton then a Capital and trading Town Mer∣chants  who sold Wares at that time within that Circuit forfeited them to the Bishop Officers were placed at a considerable Distance at Bridges  Thus at present at Newcastle At our  Gates  also  and other Avenues of Access to the Fair to exact Toll of all Merchandize passing that Way In the mean while all  Shops  in the City of Winchester were  shut  A Court called the Pavilion composed of the Bishop's Justiciaries and other Officers had Power to try Causes of various Sorts for seven Miles round The Bishop had a Toll of every Load or Parcel of Goods passing through the Gates of the City On St Giles's Eve the Mayor c delivered up the Keys of the four Gates to the Bishop's Officers Many and extraordinary were the Privileges granted to the Bishop on this Occasion all tending to ob∣struct Trade and oppress the People  Numerous foreign Merchants  It appears that the Justiciaries of the Pavilion and the Trea∣surers of the Bishop's Palace received annually for a Fee according to antient Custom four Basons and Ewers of those foreign Mer∣chants who sold brazen Vessels in the Fair and were calld  Merca∣tores  diaunteres Ibid  frequented this Fair several Streets were formed in it assigned to the Sale of different Commodities  Called the  Drapery  the  Pottery  the  Spicery  c Thus we say now the Cloth Fair the Shoe Fair c  The sur∣rounding Monasteries had Shops or Houses in these Streets used only at the Fair they held them under the Bishop and they often were let by Lease for a Term of Years  In the revenue Roll of Bishop William of Waynflete an this Fair appears to have greatly decayed in which among other Proofs I find mention made of a District in the Fair being unoc∣cupied "Ubi Homines Cornubiae stare solebant"  The whole Reception to the Bishop this Year was l s d more than l at this Day Ibid  Different Counties had their different Stations  It appears from a curious Record now re∣maining containing the Establishment and Ex∣pences of the Houshold of Henry Percy the th Earl of Northumberland A D and printed by Dr Percy that the Stores of his Lordship's House at Wresille for the whole Year were laid in from Fairs  He that stands charged with my Lordes House for the houll Yeir if he maye possible shall be at all Faires where the groice Emptions shall be boughte for the House for the houll Yeir as Wine Wax Beiffes Mul∣tons Wheite and Malt  This proves that Fairs still continued to be the principal Marts for purchasing Necessaries in large Quantities which now are sup∣plied by frequent trading Towns And the Mention of  Beisses  and  Multons  which are salted Oxen and Sheep shews that at so late a Period they knew little of breeding Cattle Their Ignorance is so important an Article of Husbandy is also an Evidence that in the Reign of King Henry VIII the State of Population was much lower among us than we may imagine Ibid    P  In  In the Statutes of St Mary Ottery's College in Devonshire given by Bishop Grandison the Founder the Sacrists and Stewards are ordered to purchase annually two hundred Pounds of Wax for the Choir of the College at Winchester Fair Ibid  the Account of the Priories of Maxtoke in Warwickshire and of

Newcastle are called Lammass and St Luke's Fairs from the Days on which they begin Mr Bourne tells us that the Tolls Booths Stallage Pickage and Courts of Pie Powder dusty Foot to each of these Fairs

quae in festis Patronorum vulgo siunt Du Cange Gloss  Pitching Pence  was paid in Fairs and Markets for every Bag of Corn c Coles Dict  Tradesmen used to bring and sell their Wares even in the

Customs in  SCHOOLS  on St  NICHOLAS' DAY  J Boëmus Aubanus  In die verò Sancti Nicolai Adolescentes qui disciplinarum gratia Scholas frequentant inter se tres eligunt unum qui Epis∣copum duos qui

used in his Time in Franco∣nia to which I have so often referred tells us that  Scholars  on St Nicholas Day used to elect  three  out  of their Number  one  of whom was to play the  Bishop  the  others  to act the Parts of  Deacons  The Bishop was escorted by the Rest of the Boys in solemn Procession to Church where with his Mitre on he presided during the Time of divine Worship This being ended he with his Deacons went about singing from Door to Door and col∣lected Money which they did not beg as Alms but  demanded  as the Bishop's Subsidy The Boys were prevailed upon to fast on the Eve of this Day in order to persuade themselves that the little Pre∣sents which on that Night were put for them into  Shoes  There is a Festival or Ceremony observed in Italy called  Zo∣pata  from a Spanish Word signifying a Shoe in the Courts of certain Princes on St Nicholas' Day wherein Persons hide Pre∣sents in the Shoes and Slippers of those they do honour to in such Manner as may surprize them on the Morrow when they come to dress This is done in Imitation of the Practice of S  t  Nicholas who used in the Night Time to throw Purses in at the Windows of poor Maids to be Marriage Portions for them Vide Bailey  placed under the Table for that Purpose were made them by their very bountiful Pre∣late NicholasOn which Account many of them kept the Fast so rigourously that their Friends were under the necessity of forcing them to take some Sustenance in order to prevent them from injuring their Health  The antient Calendar of the Church of Rome  December  Nicolao Episcopo  Scholarum feriae  Reges ad aedem muneribus pompa accedunt  Poetarum mos olim in schola ad pueros relatus  Regales in scholis Epulae  has the following Observations on this Day which is the th of December  December  "Nicholas Bishop  School Holidays  The  Kings  go to Church  With  Presents  and great shew  The antient Custom of Poets in School  related to the Boys  The  King's Feasts  in Schools"  Vestiges of these antient Popish Superstitions are still retained in several Schools about this Time of the Year particularly in the Grammar School at Durham  At  SaltHill  near Windsor the Eton Boys have an annual Custom in June of  giving Salt  and extorting Money from every one that passes byThe Captain for so they stile their Leader is said to raise some Years Pounds on this Occasion all which he claims as his own They stop even the Stage CoachesThere is generally a great Concourse of the Nobility Gentry c at SaltHill on the Day  This seems to be a Fragment but greatly mutilated of the above described antient Customs in Schools on St Nicholas' Day  I received this Information at the  WindMill  one of the very elegant Inns at SaltHill and if I mistake not the  Bedchamber  in which I slept had a Latin Title Montem above the Chimneypiece that referred to the  LittleHill  the Scene of this singular Custom  They ask and forcibly obtain from the Master what they call  Orders  I have heard also of a similar Custom at the School of HoughtonleSpring in the County of Durham  Of the  GULE  of  AUGUST  commonly called  LAMMASSDAY  "LAmmasDay says Blount the first of Au∣gust otherwise called the  Gule  or  Yule  of August which may be a Corruption of the British Word  Gwyl Awst  signifying the Feast of August  or may come from  Vincula  Chains that Day being called in Latin Festum Sancti Petri ad Vincula" The last Opinion seems a wild and vague Conjecture How much more probable is the Hypothesis of the learned  Gebelin  which the Reader will find both in the original French and translated into English if he will be at the Trouble of turning back to Page  Antiquaries are divided also in their Opinions concerning the Origin of the Word Lam or Lambmass  Some suppose it is called LammassDay  We have an old Proverb "At latter Lammass" which is sy∣nomymous with the "Ad Graecas Calendas" of the Latins and the vulgar saying "When two Sundays come together"  i e never  quasi LambMasse because on that Day the Tenants that held Lands of the Cathedral Church in York which is dedicated to Saint Peter ad Vincula  In the antient Calendar of the Romish Church I find the sub∣sequent Observation on the st of August  Chains  are worshipped c  Catenae coluntur ad Aram in Exquiliis  Ad Vicum Cyprium juxta Titi thermas  were bound by their Tenure to bring a  live Lamb  into the Church at high Mass on that Day  Others suppose it to be derived from the Saxon Hlaf Maesse  i e  Loaf Masse or Bread Masse so named as a Feast of Thanksgiving to God for the first Fruits of the Corn and seems to have been observed with  Bread of new Wheat  and accord∣ingly it is a Usage in some Places for Tenants to be bound to bring in Wheat of that Year to their Lord on or before the first of August Ham Resol to Quaeres p Vide Blount  Of the vulgar Saying "  UNDER  the  ROSE  "  DOctor Browne leaves me little more on this Subject than the easy and agreeable Task of making him speak concisely and in  plain English  Nazianzen says he seems to imply in the subse∣quent translated Verses that the  Rose  from a  natu∣ral Property  has been made the  Symbol of Silence  Utque latet Rosa verna suo putamine clausa  Sic os vincla ferat validisque arctetur habenis  Indicatque suis prolixa silentia labris  Hence it should seem when we  desire  to  confine our Words  we commonly say "they are spoken under the Rose"  There is a Propriety in this Expression also if we mean only in Society at convivial Entertain∣ments where it was an antient Custom to wear Chaplets of  Roses  about the Head  The Germans have a Custom of describing a  Rose  in the Ceiling over the Table  I shall favour my Reader here with another curious Observation of the learned Author of the Vulgar Errors  Coral  was thought to preserve and fasten the Teeth in Men yet is used in Children to make an easier Passage for them hence that wellknown Toy with Bells c and  Coral  at the end which is generally suspended from their Necks This Custom is supposed with the greatest Probabi∣lity to have had its Origin in an antient Superstition which consi∣dered it as an  Amulet  or Defensative against FascinationFor this we have the Authority of Pliny in the following Words  Aru∣spices  religiosum Coralli gestamen amoliendis periculis  arbitran∣tur Et  Surculi Infantiae alligati  tutelam habere creduntur    Lemnius and others have traced it to another Origin The  Rose  say they was the Flower of  Venus which Cupid consecrated to Harpocrates the God of Silence c it was therefore an Em∣blem of it to conceal the Pranks of Venery thus the Poet  "Ut Rosa flos Veneris cujus quo facta laterent  Harpocrati Matris dona dicavit Amor  Inde Rosam mensis Hospes suspendit amicis  Conviviae ut sub eâ  dicta tacenda  sciant"  Of the  SILLY HOW  that is the holy or fortunate  CAP  or  HOOD  VARIOUS were the Superstitions about half a Century  In Scotland says the learned and modest Author of the Glos∣sary to Douglas' Virgil the Women call a  haly  or  sely how i e  holy or fortunate Cap or Hood a Film or Membrane stretched over the Heads of Children new born which is nothing else but a Part of that which covers the Foetus in the Womb and they give out that Children so born will be very fortunate In Verbo  How  An Instance of great Fortune in one born with this  Coif  is given by Aelius Lampridius in the History of Diadumenos who came afterwards to the Sovereign Dignity of the Empire This Super∣stition prevailed much in the primitive Ages of the Church St Chrysostom in several of his Homilies inveighs against it He is particularly severe against one Praetus a Clergyman who being desirous of being  fortunate  bought such a  Coif  of a  Midwife  See Athenian Oracle  It would be giving the Reins up to Fancy altogether to suppose that the present remarkable  black Spots  in the Wigs of those of the highest Orders of the Law owe their Origin to this antient Super∣stition but I have no Kind of Doubt but that the Word  Howdy  used in the North for a  Midwife  and which I take to be a dimi∣nitive of  How  is derived from this obsolete Opinion of old Wo∣men An Etymon I have heard of  Howdy  that is "How do ye" is not unlike the "All Eggs under" of Swift and forcibly satirizes that Licentiousness of Fancy in which many Philologists have in∣dulged themselves  ago concerning a certain mem∣branous Covering commonly called the  Silly How  that was sometimes found about the Heads of newborn InfantsIt was preserved with great Care not only as medical in Diseases but also as contributing to the good Fortune of the Infant and othersThis says Dr Browne is no more than the Continuation of a Superstition that is of very remote Antiquity Thus we read in the Life of Antoninus by Spartianus that Children are sometimes born with this natural  Cap  which  Midwives  were wont to sell to credulous Lawyers who held an Opinion that it contributed to their Promotion  "But to speak strictly continues our Author the Effect is natural and thus to be conceived the Infant hath three Teguments or membranous Filmes which cover it in the Womb i e the  Corion Amnios  and  Allantois  the  Corion  is the outward Membrane wherein are implanted the Veins Arteries and umbilical Vessels whereby its Nourishment is conveyed The  Allantois  a thin Coat seated under the Corion wherein are received the watery Separa∣tions conveyed by the  Urachus  that the Acrimony thereof should not offend the Skin The  Amnios  is a general Investment contain∣ing the sudorous or thin Serosity perspirable through the Skin Now about the Time when the Infant breaketh these Coverings it sometimes carrieth with it about the Head a  Part  of the  Amnios  or neerest Coat which saith Spiegelius either proceedeth from the Toughness of the Membrane or Weaknesse of the Infant that  can∣cot get clear thereof  and therefore herein Significations are natural and concluding upon the Infant but not to be extended unto magical Signalities or any other Person"    Of the Phenomenon  Blount tells us it is a certain viscous Substance reflecting Light in the Dark evaporated out of a fat Farth and flying in the Air It commonly haunts Churchyards Privies and Fens be∣cause it is begotten out of Fatness it flies about Rivers Hedges c because in those Places there is a certain Flux of Air It fol∣lows one that follows it because the Air does so  It is called  Ignis Fatuus  or  foolish Fire  because it only  feareth  Fools Hence is it when Men are led away with some idle Fancy or Conceit we use to say an  Ignis Fatuus  hath done it Blount in Verbo  vulgarly called  WILL  or  KITTY  with the  WISP  Wisp  properly signifies a  little Twist of Straw  for the Purpose of easing the Head under the Pressure of some heavy Burthen It is corrupted into  Weeze  in the vulgar Dialect of Newcastle as also a Handful of Straw folded up a little to wipe any Thing with Thus in that very curious and scarce Poem the Visions of Pierce Plowman  "And wished it had been wiped with a  Wisp  of  Firses  " Pass  It implies in the Name of this Phenomenon a Kind of StrawTorch Thus Junius in Verbo  Frisiis  Wispien  etiamnum est  ar∣dentes straminis fasciculos  in altum tollere  These vulgar Names are undoubtedly derived from its Appear∣ance as if  Will Jack  or  Kit  some Country Fellows were going about with lighted  StrawTorches  in their Hands  or  JACK  with a  LANTHORN  How  Will a Wisp  misleads nightfaring Clowns  O'er Hills and sinking Bogs and pathless Downs  GAY  THIS  Appearance  called in Latin  Ignis Fatuus  has long been an article in the Catalogue of popular Superstitions It is said to be chiefly seen in Summer Nights frequenting Meadows Marshes and other moist PlacesIt has been thought by some to arise from a viscous Exhalation which being kindled in the Air re∣flects  a Sort of thin Flame in the Dark without any sensible Heat It is often found flying along Rivers and Hedges because as it is conjectured it meets there with a Stream of Air to direct it  Philosophers are much divided in their Solution of this Phenomenon Sir Isaac Newton says it is a Vapour shining without Heat and that there is the same Difference between this Vapour and Flame as between rotten Wood shining without Heat and burning Coals of Fire  Others suppose it to be some  nocturnal flying Insect  Indeed they have gone so many different Ways in pursuit of this Wanderer that according to the popular Notion of its conducting into Bogs and other Precipices some of them must have been misled and bewildered by itWe may follow them however as far as we please in this Paper Pursuit without any Danger  Me  iana  has given us an Accout of the famous Indian Lanthorn Fly published amongst her Insects at  Surinam  It has a Hood▪ or Bladder on its Head which gives a Light like a Lanthorn in the Night but by Daylight is clear and transparent curiously adorned with Stripes of Red or Green Colour One may read Writing of tolerable large Character by it at NightThe Creature it is said can con∣tract or dilate the Hood or Bladder over its Head at PleasureThey hide all their Light when taken but when at Liberty afford it plentifully  It inclines one to think that the Appearance un∣der Consideration is no more than the shining of some Nightflying Insect when we are informed that they give Proof as it were of Sense by avoid∣ing Objectsthat they often go in a Direction con∣trary  to the Windthat they often seem extinct and then shine againTheir passing along a few Feet above the Ground or Surface of the Water agrees with the Motion of some Insect in quest of Prey as also their settling on a Sudden and rising again immediately  I subjoin what will perhaps be thought a curious Extract con∣cerning the Appearance commonly called a  Falling Star  from Dr Charlton's Paradoxes  It is says he the  Nocturnal Pollu∣tion  of some  plethorical  and  wanton Star  or rather  Excrement blown from the Nostrils  of some  Rheumatic Planet  falling upon Plains and Sheep Pastures of an  obscure Red  or  brown Tawney  in Consistence like a  Gelly  and so trembling if touched c  The  Thoughts  in the above Passage are perhaps the  quaintest  that can be found in any Language  Haggs  says Blount are said to be made of  Saveat  or some other Vapour issuing out of the Head a not unusual Sight among us when we ride by Night in the Summertime They are extin∣guished like Flames by shaking the Horses' Manes But I believe rather it is only a Vapour reflecting Light but  sat  and  sturdy  compacted about the Manes of Horses or Men's Hair Vide Blount in Verbo    Some indeed have affirmed that  Ignes Fatui  are never seen but in Salt Marshes or other boggy Places On the other Hand it is proved that they have been seen flying over Fields Heaths and other dry Places  I am informed in Boreman's second Volume of his Description of a great Variety of Animals Ve∣getables c c that a respectable Person in Hert∣fordshire  At Astley seven Miles from Worcester three Gentlemen saw one of these Appearances in a Garden about Nine o'Clock in a dark NightAt first they imagined it to be some Country Fellow with a Lanthorn till approaching within about six Yards it sud∣denly disappearedIt became visible again in a dry Field thirty or forty Yards offit disappeared as suddenly a second Time and was seen again a hundred Yards offWhether it passed over the Hedge or went through it could not be observed for it dis∣appeared as it passed from Field to Field  At another Time when one approached within ten or twelve Yards it seemed to pack off as in a fright  presuming upon his Knowledge of the  Grounds about his House was tempted one dark Night to follow one of these Lights which he saw flying over a Piece of fallow GroundIt led him over a plowed Field flying and twisting about from Place to Placesometimes it would sudden∣ly disappear and as suddenly appear againIt once made directly to a Hedge when it came near it mounted over and he  lost Sight  after a full  Hour's Chace  In his return to his House he saw it again but was too fatigued to think of renewing the Pursuit This  Light  is said also to have been observed to stand still as well as to move and sometimes seemed  fixed  on the Surface on the WaterWe are informed that in Italy two Kinds of these Lights have been discovered one on the Mountains the other on the PlainsThe com∣mon People call them  Cularsi  because they look upon them as Birds the Belly and other Parts of which are resplendent like the  Pyraustae  or FireFlies  Mr Bradley F R S supposes the  Will  with the  Wisp  to be no more than a  Group of small enlightened Insects  Mr Fr Willoughby and Mr Ray are of Opi∣nion that the Ignis Fatuus is nothing but the shining of some Nightflying InsectDr Derham was of Opinion they were fired Vapours  There is a Fire some Times seen flying in the Night like a Dragon who has seen a Dragon that may with Propriety speak to the Resemblance It is called a  FireDrake  Common People think it a Spirit that keeps some Treasure hid but Philosophers affirm it to be a great unequal Exhalation inflamed between two Clouds the one hot the other cold which is the Reason that it also smokes the middle Part whereof according to the Proportion of the hot Cloud being greater than the Rest makes it seem like a Belly and both Ends like a Head and Tail See Blount    After having summoned such respectable Wit∣nesses in the Cause under Consideration and having found that their Depositions by no means agree I shall not presume to sum up the Evidence or pronounce Sentence  We leave therefore the Decision of the Contro∣versy to future Discoveries in Natural History and to the Determination of succeeding Times  Of the  BORROWED DAYS  THere is an old Proverb preserved in Ray's Collection  "  April  borrows three Days of March and they are  ill  "  April  is pronounced with an Emphasis on the last Syllable and so it is made into a Kind of Rhyme  I have taken Notice of this because I find in the antient Calendar of the Church of Rome to which I have so often referred the following Ob∣servations on the st of March  The rustic Fable concerning the Nature of the Month  The rustic Names of six Days which shall  follow  in  April  or may be the  last  of  March  Rustica fabula de natura Mensis  Nomina rustica Dierum qui sequentur  in Aprili ceu ultimi sint  Martii    There is no Doubt but that these Observations in the antient Calendar and our Proverb are de∣rived from one common OriginI confess myself in the mean while unable to go any farther in tra∣cing them back to their Source  Of  COCKFIGHTING    Quanquam  in media jam morte  tenentur Non tamen  disistunt Martemve iramve remittunt Magnanimi  From a beautiful Latin Poem on this Subject in the d Volume of the Mulae Anglicanae it is signed Jo Friend Aedis Christi Alamnus    MEN have long availed themselves of the  Antipathy one Cock  shews to  another  and have encouraged that natural hatred with Arts that disgrace human ReasonThe Origin of this Sport is said to be derived from the Athenians on the following Occasion When Themistocles was marching his Army against the Persians he by the Way espying two Cocks fighting caused his Army to behold them and made the following Speech to them "Behold these do not fight for their House∣hold Gods for the Monuments of their Ancestors nor for Glory nor for Liberty nor for the Safety of their Children but only because the one will not give Way unto the other" This so encou∣raged the Grecians that they fought strenuously and obtained the Victory over the Persians upon which Cockfighting was by a particular Law or∣dained to be annually practised by the Athenians and hence was the Original of the Sport in England derivedThus  I do not find his Authority for this among the Antients It is not taken Notice of by  Plutarch  Neither does  Cornelius Nepos  mention any such Incident in his Memoir of Themistocles  far Mr BaileyThe best Trea∣tise on this Subject is in the third Volume of the  Archacologia by one  I wish this ingenious Gentleman's Dissuasions against our barba∣rous Sport may be found cogent enough to put an  End  to  it  He has been happily successful in tracing its Origin  who is an Ornament to a Society the Institution of which does Honour to our Country  I shall give the Reader something like a Com∣pendium of this excellent MemoirThough the antient Greeks piqued themselves on their Polite∣ness calling all other Nations  barbarous  yet Mr Pegge has proved clearly in this Treatise that they were the Authors of this cruel and inhuman Mode of Diversion The Inhabitants of Delos were great Lovers of this Sport and  Tanagra  a City of Boeotia the Isle of Rhodes Chalcis in Euboea and the Country of Media were famous for their generous and magnanimous Race of Chickens It appears they had some Method of preparing the Birds for Battle  The modern Manner of Preparing is thus described in the Poem above cited  Nec per Agros sivit dulces ve errare per hortos  Ne Venerc absumant natas ad praelia vires  Aut Alvo nimium pleni turgente laborent  Sed rerum prudens penetrali in sede locavit  Et salicis circum virgas dedit insuper ipsos  Cortibus inclusos tenero nutrimine fovit  Et panem mulsumque

partly religious and partly political at  AthensSocrates sacrificed a Cock to Aesculapius and was continued there for the Purpose of improv∣ing the Seeds of Valour in the Minds of their YouthBut it was afterwards abused and per∣verted both there and in other Parts of Greece to a common Pastime and Amusement without any  moral  political or religious Intention and as it is now followed and practised amongst usIt appears that the Romans who borrowed this with many other Things from Greece used Quails  Hence Marcus Aurelius sect says "I learn from Diog∣netus" ne rebus inambus shedium impenderem ne Coturnices ad pugnam alerem neve rebus istiusmodi animum adj  cerem  as well as Cocks for fightingThe first Cause of Contention between the two Brothers Bassianus and Geta Sons of the

thought that with this Cockfighting would also have been discarded under the mild and humane genius of ChristianityBut it was reserved for this enlightened Aera to practise it with new and  aggravating Circumstances of CrueltyThe Shrove Tuesday  Massacre  To the Credit of our northern Manners the barbarous Sport of  throwing  at Cocks on Shrove Tuesday is worn out in this Country  of this useful and spirited Crea∣ture is now indeed in a declining Way but that monstrous Barbarity the Battleroyal and Welshmain still continue to be in full Force amongst us A striking Disgrace to the manly Character of Britons  It is probable that Cockfighting was first in∣troduced into this Island by the RomansThe Bird itself was here before Caesar's Arrival  B G V Sect    William FitzStephen who wrote the Life of Becket in the Reign of Henry II is the first of our Writers that mentions  Cocking  describing it as the Sport of Schoolboys  It was also a Boys Sport at Rome  on Shrove Tuesday The

Extra∣vagance and Superstition of Pythagoreans and Bramins yet certainly we have  no right  no Power or Authority to abuse and torment any of God's Creatures or needlessly to sport with their Lives but on the contrary ought to use them with all possible Tenderness and Moderation  In a Word Cockfighting is an heathenish Mode of Diversion from the first and at this Day ought certainly to be confined to barbarous Nations Yet it may and must be added to aggravate the Matter and enhance our Shame that our Butchers have contrived a Method unknown to the Antients of arming the Heels of the Bird with Steel a De∣vice considered as a most noble Improvement  Pliny mentions the Spur and calls it  Telum  but the  Castle  is a mere modern Invention as likewise is the great and I suppose necessary exactness in matching them  N B The Asiatics however use Spurs that act on each Side like a Lancet and which almost immediately decide the BattleHence they are never permitted by the modern Cockfighters  in the Art and indeed an Invention highly worthy of Men that delight in Blood"  It still continues to be a favourite Sport of our  Col∣liers  in the North  In performing not long since the Service appropriated to the  Visitation  of  the Sick  with one of  these Men  who died a few Days after to my great Astonishment I was interrupted by the  crowing  of a  Game Cock  hung in a Bag  over his Head  to this  Exaltation  an  immediate Answer  was  given  by another  Cock conceale  in a  Closet  to whom the first  replied  and instantly the  last rejoined  I never met with an

amplexibus escam  Vincit  amor gallorum  et  avitae gloria gentis  Of the Vulgar Superstitions concerning the  MOON  THE Moon the antient Object of idolatrous Worship has in later Times composed an Article in the Creed of popular Superstition The Moon Dr Johnson tells us has great influence in vulgar Philosophy In his Memory he observes it was a Precept annually given in one of the Eng∣lish Almanacks to kill Hogs when the Moon was increasing and the Bacon would prove the better in boiling  The common People Bailey tells us in some Counties in England are accustomed at the Prime of the Moon to say "It is a fine Moon God bless her" which some imagine to proceed from a blind Zeal retained from the antient Irish who worship∣ped the Moon or from a Custom in Scotland particularly in the Highlands where the Women make a Curtesy to the New Moon And some English Women still retain a Touch of this Genti∣lism who getting up upon and sitting astride on a Gate or Stile the first Night of the New Moon say  "All hail to the Moon all hail to thee  I prithee good Moon declare to me  This Night who my Husband shall be"  The antient Druids had their superstitious Rites at the Changes of the MoonThe  hornedness  of the New Moon is still faintly considered by the vulgar as an Omen with Regard to the Weather  The Rev Mr Shaw in his Account of Elgin and the Shire of Murray See Appendix to Pen∣nant's  Tour informs us that at the full Moon in March they cut  Withes  of the Misletoe or Ivy make Circles of them keep them all the Year and pretend to cure  Hectics  and other troubles by them  Dr Johnson in his Journey to the Western Islands tells us they expect better Crops of Grain by sowing their Seed in the Moon's Increase  Of  SECOND SIGHT  THE learned Author of the Rambler having favoured the Public with his Thoughts on this singular Kind of Superstition and having so lately visited the Scene of its declining Influence it will be unnecessary to apologize for using his own Words on the Subject "We should have had little claim says he to the Praise of Curiosity if we had not endeavoured with particular Attention to examine the Question of the  Second Sight  Of an Opinion received for Centuries by a whole Nation and supposed to be confirmed through its whole Descent by a series of successive Facts it is desirable that the Truth should be established or the Fallacy detected  The  Second Sight  is an Impression made either by the Mind upon the Eye or by the Eye upon the Mind by which Things distant or future are perceived and seen as if they were present A Man on a Journey far from Home falls from his Horse another who is perhaps at work about the House  sees him bleeding upon the Ground commonly with a Landscape of the Place where the Accident befalls him Another Seer driving Home his Cat∣tle or wandering in Idleness or musing in the Sun∣shine is suddenly surprized by the Appearance of a bridal Ceremony or funeral Procession and counts the Mourners or Attendants of whom if he knows them he relates the Names if he knows them not he can describe the Dresses Things distant are seen at the Instant when they happen Of Things future I know not that there is any Rule for determining the Time between the Sight and the Event  This receptive Faculty for Power it cannot be called is neither voluntary nor constant The Appearances have no Dependence upon Choice they cannot be summoned detained or recalled The Impression is sudden and the Effect often painful  By the term Second Sight seems to be meant a Mode of seeing superadded to that which Nature generally bestows In the Earse it is called Taisch which signifies likewise a Spectre or a Vision I know not nor is it likely that the Highlanders ever examined whether by Taisch used for the Second Sight they mean the Power of seeing or the Thing seen  I do not find it to be true as it is reported that to the Second Sight nothing is presented but Phantoms of Evil Good seems to have the same Proportion in those visionary Scenes as it obtains in real Life almost all remarkable Events have evil for their Basis and are either Miseries incurred  or Miseries escaped Our Sense is so much strong∣er of what we suffer than of what we enjoy that the Ideas of pain predominate in almost every Mind What is Recollection but a Revival of Vexations or History but a Record of Wars Treasons and Calamities Death which is consi∣dered as the greatest Evil happens to all The greatest good be it what it will is the Lot but of a Part  That they should often see Death is to be ex∣pected because Death is an Event frequent and important But they see likewise more pleasing Incidents A Gentleman told me that when he had once gone far from his own Island one of his labouring Servants predicted his Return and de∣scribed the Livery of his Attendant which he had never worn at Home and which had been with∣out any previous Design occasionally given him  Our Desire of Information was keen and our Inquiry frequent Mr Boswell's Frankness and Gaiety made every Body communicative and we heard many Tales of these airy Shows with more or less Evidence and Distinctness  It is the common Talk of the Lowland Scots that the Notion of the Second Sight is wearing away with other Superstitions and that its Reality is no longer supposed but by the grossest People How far its Prevalence ever extended or what Ground it has lost I know not The Islanders of all degrees whether of Rank or Understanding universally admit it except the Ministers who universally deny it and are suspected to deny it in Consequence of a System against Conviction  One of them honestly told me that he came to Sky with a Resolution not to believe it  Strong Reasons for Incredulity will readily occur This Faculty of seeing Things out of sight is local and commonly useless It is a Breach of the common Order of Things without any visible Reason or perceptible Benefit It is ascribed only to a People very little enlightened and among them for the most Part to the mean and the ignorant  To the Confidence of these Objections it may be replied that by presuming to determine what is fit and what is beneficial they presuppose more Knowledge of the universal System than Man has attained and therefore depend upon Principles too complicated and extensive for our Comprehen∣sion and that there can be no Security in the Consequence when the Premises are not under∣stood that the Second Sight is only wonderful because it is rare for considered in itself it in∣volves no more difficulty than dreams or perhaps than the regular Exercises of the cogitative Facul∣ty that a general Opinion of communicative Im∣pulses or visionary representations has prevailed in all Ages and all Nations that particular Instan∣ces have been given with such Evidence as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to resist that sudden Impressions which the Event has ve∣rified have been felt by more than own or pub∣lish them that the Second Sight of the Hebrides implies only the local Frequency of a Power which is nowhere totally unknown and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent Reason we must be content to yield to the Force of Testimony  By pretension to Second Sight no profit was ever sought or gained It is an involuntary Af∣fection in which neither Hope nor Fear are known to have any Part Those who profess to feel it do not boast of it as a Privilege nor are considered by others as advantageously distinguished They have no temptation to feign and their hearers have no motive to encourage the Imposture  To talk with any of these Seers is not easy There is one in Sky with whom we would have gladly conversed but he was very gross and ig∣norant and knew no English The Proportion in these Countries of the Poor to the Rich is such that if we suppose the Quality to be accidental it can very rarely happen to a Man of Education and yet on such Men it has sometimes fallen There is now a Second Sighted Gentleman in the Highlands who complains of the Terrors to which he is exposed  The foresight of the Seers is not always pre∣science they are impressed with Images of which the Event only shews them the Meaning They tell what they have seen to others who are at that Time not more knowing than themselves but may become at last very adequate Witnesses by comparing the Narrative with its Verification  To collect sufficient Testimonies for the Satis∣faction of the Publick or ourselves would have required more Time than we could bestow There is against it the seeming Analogy of Things con∣fusedly seen and little understood and for it the indistinct Cry of national Persuasion which may be perhaps resolved at last into Prejudice and Tra∣dition I never could advance my Curiosity to  conviction but came away at last only willing to beleive"  Of  DREAMS  EVERY Dream according to Wolfius takes its Rise from some Sensation and is continu∣ed by the Succession of Phantasms in the Mind His Reasons are that when we dream we imagine something or the Mind produces Phantasms but no Phantasms can arise in the Mind without a previous Sensation hence neither can a Dream arise without some previous Sensation  Lord Bacon observes that the Interpretation of natural Dreams has been much laboured but mixed with numerous Extravagancies and adds that at present it stands not upon its best Founda∣tion It may be observed that in our Days except amongst the most ignorant and vulgar the whole imaginary Structure is fallen to the Ground  Physicians seem to be the only Persons at pre∣sent who interpret Dreams frightful Dreams are perhaps always Indications of some violent Oppres∣sion of Nature Hippocrates has may curious Observations on Dreams Ennius of old has made that very sensible Remark that what Men studied and pondered in the Day Time the same they dreamed on at Night I suppose there are few who cannot from their own Experience assent to the Truth of his Observation  Various are the popular Superstitions or at least the faint Traces of them that yet are made  use of to procure Dreams of Divination Such as fasting St Agnes'  Festum S Agnetis celebrari coeptum est propter

here vulgarly the  "Groaning Cheese"  under the Pillow to cause young Persons to dream of their Lovers c Various also are the Interpretations of Dreams given by old Women but of which the Regard is

supposed to mean any ill by it are aware that it is synonymous with "sending you to the Devil" Yet is it undoubtedly of equal Import wth the Latin "Abi in malam rem"  Dusius  Quoniam creberrima fama

 libidinous Daemon  who used to violate the Chastity of Women and with the  Incubus  of old was charged with doing a great Deal of Mischief of so subtle a Nature that as none saw it it did not seem possible to be prevent∣ed Later Times have done both these Devils justice  candidly  supposing them to have been much traduced by a certain Set of Delinquents who used to father upon  invisible  and  imaginary Agents  the Crimes of  real Men  Of the  LONG POLES  which are used as  SIGNS  to  BARBER'S SHOPS  BArbers' Shops are generally marked by long Poles instead of Signs The Athenian Oracle accounts for this Custom which is of remote Antiquity in the following Manner The Barber's Art was so beneficial to the Public that he who first brought it up in Rome had as Authors relate a Statue erected to his Memory In England they were in some sort the Surgeons of old Times into  whose Art those beautiful  Leeches  An old Word for a Doctor or a Surgeon  our fair Virgins then too used to be initiated Thus in corporate Towns the present Companies of BarberChirur∣geons They therefore used to hang their Basons out upon Poles to make known at a Distance to the weary and wounded Traveller  I am better pleased with the subsequent ingenious Co  jecture which I take the Liberty of extracting from the  Antiquarian Repertory  The Barber's Pole has been the Subject of many Conjectures some conceiving it to have originated from the Word  Poll  or Head with several other Conceits as far fetched and as unmeaning but the true Intention of that partycoloured Staff was to shew the Master of the Shop practised Surgery and could breathe a Vein as well as mow a Beard such a Staff being to this Day by every Village Practi∣tioner put into the Hand of a Patient undergoing the Operation of Phlebotomy The white Band which encompasses the Staff was meant to represent the Phillet thus elegantly twined about it p  where all might have recourse They used Poles as some Inns still gibbet their

 Of the  WANDERING JEW  DR Percy  Dr Brown remarks upon this Legend which as it has been an Article of the Peoples' Belief merited some Consideration "Sure were this true the wandering Jew might be a happy Ar∣bitrator in many Christian Controversies but must unpardonably condemn the Obstinacy of the Jews who can contemn the Rheto∣ric of such Miracles and blindly behold so living and lasting Conversions"  tells us "the Story of the wander∣ing Jew is of considerable Antiquity It had obtained full Credit in this Part of the World before the Year as we learn from Matt Paris For in that Year it seems there came an  Armenian Archbishop into England to visit the Shrines and Reliques preserved in our Churches who being entertained at the Monastry of St Al∣ban's was asked several Questions relating to his Country c Among the rest a Monk who sat near him enquired  if he had ever seen or heard of the famous Person named Joseph that was so much talked of who was present at our Lord's Crucifixion and conversed with him and who was still alive in Confirmation of the Christian Faith  The Archbishop answered that the Fact was true and afterwards one of his Train who was well known to a Servant of the Abbot's in∣terpreting his Master's Words told them in French that his Lord knew the Person they spoke of very well that he dined at his Table but a little while before he left the East that he had been Pon∣tius Pilate's Porter by Name Cartaphilus who when they were dragging Jesus out of the Door of the Judgmenthall struck him with his Fist on the Back saying "go faster Jesus go faster why dost thou linger" Upon which Jesus looked at him with a Frown and said  I indeed am going but thou shalt tarry till I come  Soon after he was converted and baptized by the Name of Jo∣seph He lives for ever but at the End of every hundred Years falls into an incurable Illness and at length into a Fit of Extacy out of which when he recovers he returns to the same State of Youth he was in when Jesus suffered being then about thirty Years of Age He remembers all the Circumstances of the Death and Resurrection of Christ the Saints that arose with him the com∣posing  of the Apostles' Creed their Preaching and Dispersion and is himself a very grave and holy Person This is the Substance of M Paris' Ac∣count who was himself a Monk at St Alban's and was living at the Time when this Armenian Arch∣bishop made the above Relation Since his Time several Impostors have appeared at Intervals under the Name and Character of the wandering Jew See Calmet's Dict of Bible Turkish Spy Vol B Let "  We had one of these Impostors not many Years ago here in the North who made a very Hermitlike Appearance and went up and down our Streets with a long Train of Boys at his Heels muttering "poor John  Aliter  poor  Jew  alone  alone" "poor John alone" in a Manner singularly plaintive  Of the vulgar Saying that a  HUSBAND WEARS HORNS  or is a  CORNUTE  when his Wife proves false to him Also

almost universally of saying that the un∣happy Husbands of false Women  wear Horns  or are  Cornutes  it may be said almost universally for we are told that even among the Indians it was the highest Indignity that could be offered them even to  point at  a  Horn  In Spain it is a Crime as much punishable by the Laws to put up Horns against a Neighbour's House as to have written a Libel against him  There is a great Parade of Learning on the Sub∣ject of this very  serious  Jest in the "Paradise of pleasant Questions" Question Various  Elysius jucund arum Questionum Campus  Bruxellae Folio  are the Opinions the learned have given in that curious Collection of this strange CustomI shall present the Reader with the Sum of each of them The Lawyer Parladorus supposes the Word  Cornutus  a com∣pound of  nudus corde  as meaning a pitiful and sneaking Fellow as that Man must needs be who can sit down tamely under so great an Insult  A Conjecture this that is perhaps worthy of some of our English Etymologists who in Matters that required the deepest Exertion of the  Judgment  have left all to the Licentiousness of Fancy and of Consequence disgraced the Study of Philology  Caelius Rhodoginus wishes to derive it from an Insensibility peculiar as he says to the  HeGoat  A ducenda Uxore valde abhorreo quia Gentem  barbatulam hircosamque progeniem  pertremisco  Elysius jucund Quest

Derision is  made to ride on a Pole for his Neigh∣bour's Wife's Fault  See Glossary to Gaw Douglas' Virgil  And Aldrovandus accounts for this by telling us that this very salacious Animal is debilitated by his Excesses before he is Six Years old after which Period as if conscious of his own Impotence he will molest no Rival This too has been exploded for it has been proved that this Animal is equally jealous with and will fight like others on such an Occasion  Another Conjecture is that some mean Hus∣bands availing themselves of their Wives' Beauty have turned it to account by  prostituting  them obtaining by this Means the  Horn  Pauper erat sieri vult dives quaerit et unde  Vendidit Uxorem Naenius emit agrum  Martial Epigram  of Amalthea  the CornuCopia which if I mistake not is called in the Language of modern Gallantry tipping the Horns with Gold There seems to be a great Deal of Probability in this Surmise Pancirollus on the other Hand derives it from a Custom of the de∣bauched Emperor  Andronicus  who used to hang up in a Frolic in the Porticos of the Forum the Stags Horns he had taken in Hunting intending as he says by this new Kind of Insignia to denote at once the Manners of the City the Lascivious∣ness  of the Wives he had debauched and the Size of the Animals he had made his Prey and that from hence the Sarcasm spread abroad that the Husband of an adulterous Wife  bare Horns  I am not satisfied with this last Account all one gathers from it seems to be that what  Andronicus  did was a  Continuation  not the  Origin  of this Cus∣tom As to the Word  Cuckold  Pliny tells us that  Vinedressers  were antiently called  Cuckows i e slothful  because they deferred cutting their Vines till  that Bird  began to sing which was later than the right Time so that the same Name  may  have been given to the unhappy Persons under Consideration when through  disregard  and  neglect  of their fair Partners they have caused them to go a gadding in search of more diligent and industrous Companions  it is plainly from the Latin  Cuculus  the  Cuckow  a Bird that as Aristotle says builds no Nest herself but deposits her Eggs in that of some other Bird who hatches and adopts  her  Offspring as the  Mari Cocu  French for Cuckold  does the Children who are none of his  I must conclude this Subject with an Apology it is not of the most delicate Kind yet in speaking of popular Antiquities it seemed incumbent upon me to say something about it  To jest concerning a Crime which is replete with every Evil to Society is indeed to scatter  Firesbrands and Arrows  in our Sport It may be added there is no philosophical Justice in such In∣sults If the Husband was not to blame it is highly ungenerous and an Instance of that  common Meanness  in Life of confounding a Person's  Misfor∣tunes  with his  Faults  The Cruelty of such wanton Reflections will appear if we consider that a Man plagued with a vicious Wife needs no Aggrava∣tion of

when every Body strives to make as many Fools as he can The Wit chiefly consists in sending Per∣sons on what are called  sleeveless  Skinner guesses this to mean a  lifeless Errand  I am not sa∣tisfied with this  Etymon  he assigns no Cause for his Conjecture This Epithet is found in Chaucer  Errands for the History of  Eve's Mother  for  Pigeon Milk  with similar ridiculous Absurdities He takes no Notice of the Rise of this singular Kind of  Anniversary  This is generally called  All  Fools' Day a Corruption it should seem of  Auld  i e  Old  Fools' Day in Confirmation of which Opi∣nion I quote an Observation on the First of  Vide Hallow Even or Nutcrack Night  November in the antient Roman Calendar so often cited  The Feast of  Old Fools  I find in Poor Robin's Almanack for a  pleasant  and what is meant for a  poetical  Description of the modern Fooleries on the st of April with the open Avowal of being ignorant of the Origin of them  The first of April some do say  Is set apart for AllFools Day  But why the People call it so  Nor I nor they themselves do know  But on this Day are People sent  On Purpose for pure Merriment  And though the Day is known before  Yet frequently there is great Store  Of these Forgetfuls to be found  Who're sent to dance  Moll Dixon's round  And having tried each Shop and Stall  And disappointed at them all  At last some tells them of the Cheat  Then they return from their Pursuit  And straightway Home with Shame they run  And others laugh at what is done  But 'tis a Thing to be disputed  Which is the greatest  Fool  reputed  The Man that innocently went  Or he that him design'dly sent  is removed to  this Day  This  Old Fools  seems to denote it to be a different Day from the "Feast of Fools" which was held on the First of January of which a particular Description may be found in Du Cange's learned Glossary in verbo  Kalendae  See New Year's Day All our Antiquaries that I have had the Opportunity of consulting are silent concerning the  first of April  It owes its Beginning probably to a  Removal  which was of frequent Use in the crowded Roman Calendar and of which I have just now adduced a seemingly apposite Instance There is nothing hardly says the Author of the Essay to retrieve the antient Celtic that will bear a clearer Demonstration than that the primitive Christians by Way of con∣ciliating the Pagans to a better Worship humoured their Prejudices by yielding to a Conformity of Names  This Writer contends that the ancient Druidical Religion of Britain and the Gauls had its  Pope  its  Cardinals  its Bishops its Deacons c  and even of Customs where they did not essentially interfere with the Fundamentals of the Gospel Doctrine This was done in Order to quiet their Possession and to secure their Tenure  An admirable Expedient and extremely fit in those barbarous Times to prevent the People from re∣turning to their old Religion Among these in Imitation of the Roman  Saturnalia  was the  Festum Fatuorum  when Part of the Jollity of the Season was a burlesque Election of a Mock Pope Mock Cardinals Mock Bishops  Andrew  says this Writer signifies a head Druid or Divine Hence it was that when the Christians by way of exploding the Druids turned them into Ridicule in their Feast or Holiday of Fools one of the Buffoon Personages was a  Merry Andrew  " This Name is usually but as erroneously as it should seem from this Writer's Explication derived from the Greek where it signifies  manly  or  courageous  From the Contrarieties in the Definitions of Etymologists Philology

and Antics such as singing and dancing in the Churches in lewd Attitudes to ludicrous Anthems all allusively to the exploded Pretensions of the Druids whom  these Sports were calculated to expose to Scorn and Derision  This  Feast of Fools  had continues he its designed Effect and contributed perhaps more to the Extermination of those Heathens than all the collateral Aids of Fire and Sword neither of which were spared in the Persecution of them The Continuance of Customs especially droll ones which suit the gross Taste of the Multitude after the original Cause of them has ceased is a great but no uncommon Absur∣dity  Our Epithet  We in the North call Persons who are thus deceived AprilGowksA Gowk is properly a Cuckow and is used here meta∣phorically in vulgar Language for a Fool

the  Pictures of Druids transmitted to us The united Appearances of Age Sanctity and Wisdom which these  antient Priests  assumed doubtless contributed not a little to the Deception of the People The Christian Teachers in their Labours to  unde∣ceive  the fettered Multitudes would probably spare no Pains to pull off the Mask from these venerable Hypocrites and point out to their Converts that  Age  was not always synonymous with  Wisdom  that  Youth  was not the peculiar Period of  Folly  but that with  young  ones there were also Old  Auld  Fools  The Reader must content himself with this Ex∣plication which I think not an improbable one at least till a better can be found In joining the scattered Fragments that survive the Mutilation of antient Customs we must be forgiven if all the Parts are not found closely to agree little of the  Means of Information is transmitted to us that little can only be  eked  out by Conjecture  I have sometimes thought that the obsolete Sports of the antient  Hoctide  an old Saxon Word importing the Time of  Scorning  or  Triumphing  If I were asked to turn this  "Fools' Day"  into Latin methinks it could not be more aptly rendered than by "  Dies

Authority for this Sup∣position and insert it as a mere Conjecture  Hoke Day  Hardeknuto mortuo liberata est Anglia extunc a servitute Danorum In cujus signum usque hodie illa die vulgariter dictu

Moors and was probably a Kind of Pyrrhick or Military Dance  Morisco  says Blount Span a Moor also a Dance so called wherein there were usually five Men and a Boy dressed in a Girl's Habit whom they called the  Maid Marrion  or perhaps  Morian  from the Italian  Morione  a Headpiece because her Head was wont to be gaily trimmed up Common People call it a  Morris Dance  To the Note on  Toast  Page add  In the  Tatler  Vol No it is said that the Word in its present Sense had its Rise from an Acci∣dent at the Town of Bath in the Reign of Charles the IId It happened that on a public Day a celebrated Beauty of those Times was in the  Cross Bath  and one of the crowd of her Ad∣mirers took a Glass of the Water in which the Fair One stood and drank her Health to the Company There was in the Place a gay Fel∣low half fuddled who offered to jump in and swore though he liked not the  Liquor  he  would have the  Toast  He was opposed in his Resolution yet this Whim gave Foundation to the present Honour which is done to the Lady we mention in our Liquor who has ever since been called a  Toast  I am not able to controvert this Account but am by no means satisfied with itThe Wit here is likelier to have been a  Consequence  than the  Cause  of this singular Use of the Word it puts one in Mind of the wellknown Reply of a Mr  Brown  in some late Jest Book who on having it observed to him that he had given a certain Lady a long while for his  Toast  answered "Yes but I have not been able to  toast her Brown  yet"  Archbishop Tillotson tells us  That in all Pro∣bability those common
