Seas  CHART of the Track of the  Dolphin Tamar Swallow Endeavour  through the  SOUTH SEAS  of the Track of  M Bougainville round the WORLD  COMMODORE BYRON's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD In and  HIS present Majesty having formed a design of prosecuting the discovery of countries in the South Seas was pleased in the year to give orders for the carrying this design into execution in consequence of which the Dolphin ship of war and the Tamar frigate were fitted manned and victualled for this expedition  Mr Byron was commander in chief and Captain Mouat had the honour of commanding the frigate under him They sailed from the Downs on the st of June but the Dolphin running aground she was put into Plymouth Dock and examined she had however sustained no injury and on the d of July the Commodore hoisted his broad pendant and sailed in prosecution of his voyage On the th they anchored in the road of Fonchiale at the island of Madeira the Governor of which saluted the Captain with guns and the compliment was returned They sailed on the th and on the st were in sight of Palma one of the Canary Islands Their water having become foul and stinking they purified  it by forcing a stream of air through it by means of a  nd of ventilator constructed for that purpose On the th and th they saw the Canary Islands and anchored in the bay of Port Praya on the thHaving taken in water and purchased some fresh provisions they sail  d with all possible expedition for fear of the tornadoes which are very common on this coast from August till November  Most of the crew had purchased monkies lean goats and fowls in exchange for their old jackets shirts c It had been remarked before and was now again observed that no fish would come near the ship which was attributed to her being sheathed with copper this was a mort  fying circumstance as there were immense numbers of fish within sight  On the th of September they came to an anchor in the road of Rio de Janeiro on the coast of Brazil when the Commodore paid a visit to the Governor who received him in state being attended by some persons of distinction and having many officers and a Captain's guard under arms before the palace Fifteen guns were fired in honour of the English flag and the Governor afterwards return  the Commodore's visit on board the Dolphin M  y of the people on board the Tamar  l  gings were provided for them on  where they soon recovered but the  of the Dolphin kept their health  through the plentiful use of fresh meat and greens  While the ship lay in this harbour the Portuguese enticed away nine of the crew of the Tamar and five from the Dolphin The former were recovered by a party sent after them in the night but the Commodore could never learn where his men were secreted This practice of kidnapping the English tars is here carried on with impunity and when all other methods fail the poor fellows are generally made drunk and then sent up the country till the ship to which they belong is sailed They weighed anchor on the th of October and on the d the Commodore informed the crew that they were not bound as they thought directly to the East Indies but on a voyage to make discoveries and that on their behaving well the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered them double pay and other emoluments They were transported with this news declared their willingness to serve their country and promised obedience to the orders of the Commodore On the th they encountered so violent a storm that they were obliged to throw four guns overboard it continued very tempestuous all night but dying away in the morning they made sail and in degrees minutes south latitude found the weather most intolerably cold though it was now the latter end of October and November in that climate answers  to May in England The sailors now repented the having bartered their old cloaths for eatables but they were soon refurnished with the slops that were on board  The Commodore on the d of November delivered their commissions to his officers after they had taken the customary oath They now beheld vast numbers of pintadoes and other birds in flocks about the ship Observing the colour of the water to be changed they stood in for land on the th of this month and found ground at the depth of fathom The next day the men on the forecastle called out at the same instant  "Land right ahead"  The Commodore looked forward and saw what he thought an island composed of two hills and land joining to it which ran far to the southeast but in the end this proved to be only a fogbank which vanished on a sudden These deceptions are not unfrequent not long since the master of a vessel made oath that he had seen an island and trees growing on it between Newfoundland and the west coast of Ireland in consequence of which some ships were sent in search of it but it could never be found  In the afternoon of the th the wind shifted the sky grew black to windward and a strange noise was heard resembling the roaring of the sea on a shallow coast Hundreds of birds were observed flying from the storm  and shrieking through dreadful apprehension At length it reached the ship before she was prepared for it and laid her on her side The first Lieutenant was beat down by the main sheet by which some of his teeth were knocked out and he was otherwise terribly bruised The mainsail of the Tamar was split but as she was to leeward of the Dolphin she had more time to prepare for the threatened storm The wind continued violent all night but abated in the morning when the sea was observed to be covered with a small red fish like crayfish great numbers of which were catched by the ship's crew  On the th they steered for Cape Blanco shaping their course agreeable to the chart of it laid down in Anson's Voyage On the th they saw the Cape and for two days struggled hard to reach Port Desire but the description given of it in Narborough's Voyage is so perplexed that they were much at a loss They stood into a bay south of the Cape but could find no port On the th they saw Penguin Island and as Port Desire was said to be a few leagues northwest of it a boat was sent out which found it In these seas there were thousands of seals and penguins near the ship On the st they entered the harbour of Port Desire and the Commodore in his boat attended by two other boats went to sound it Mr Byron landed and found the country all one continued  down having neither shrubs or trees They had a sight of four beasts near hands high and in shape like a deer which they took to be guanicoes The Commodore having returned to his boat went higher up the harbour to an island abounding with seals more than of which they killed some of them exceeding the size of an ordinary bullock They likewise killed a variety of birds one with a head like an eagle with a large comb on it and a white ruff like a lady's tippet round the neck the feathers on the back were black and of a most exquisite polish the legs were large and strong with talons somewhat like the eagle the wings being extended measured no less than feet from their extremities  On the st the Tamar sailed into the harbour with the rising of the tide but the Dolphin waiting for a wind ran on shore where she remained all night and the next day in very tempestuous weather On the d they saw the track of a tyger and several other beasts and found a nest of ostriches eggs which proved to be good eating On the th the ships were both properly moored in the harbour where the water rises no less than feet at spring tides  The Commodore went on shore this day and shot a hare weighing pounds and saw several others as large as fawns On the th he landed again and found the barrel of an old  musquet with the King's broad arrow on it and an old oar of a singular form The musquetbarrel was so decayed that it would crumble to dust with the touch These things it is probable were left by the crew of the Wager or possibly by Sir John Narborough  They here saw the remains of fires but met with no inhabitants The only vegetable they found was wild peas They killed several wild ducks and shot a ball through the body of a hare which ran two miles before he dropped the flesh of this animal is delicious and as white as snow Two old guanicoes and a fawn were killed by another party and some of the former were seen of weight  The skull and bones of a man having been found were brought on board as was likewise a young guanicoe which was very beautiful and grew quite tame but died in a short time Happily on the  th two springs of tolerable water were found and on the next day a tun of it was brought on board The Commodore went again on shore where such an immense number of birds took flight as actually darkened the sky and it was impossible to walk without treading on their eggs These eggs the men are though there were young birds in the greater part of them  On the th some men being sent on shore for water two of them who first came to it saw  a tyger lying on the ground who taking no kind of notice of them they threw stones at him still however they could not provoke his rage he waited till the rest came up and then walked leisurely off The country near this bay abounds with geese ducks widgeon and seapies besides several birds the names of which are unknown  On the th of December the ships got under sail and during that and the following day had pleasant weather and a fine gale They now steered for Pepys' Isle which is described as lying in degrees south latitude The weather was now very clear and the ships by spreading from each other could between them command a prospect of leagues They thus continued their search for this supposed island till the th of the month when the Commodore convinced that there was no such place resolved to stand in for the main to take in wood and water which began to be much wanted  Large whales now swam frequently about the ship and birds flew round them in great numbers On the th the wind blew a perfect hurricane before which it would have been safest to have ran but the fear of being driven too far from land while they were in want of water determined them to endeavour to weather it which they did till it abated which was at eight o'clock the next morning On  map of North and South America  the th they saw land which like that near Port Desire was of the downy kind without trees They now observed porpoises which were milk white with black spots pursuing the fish in the sea of which there were great numbers  On the th they ran close in shore to Cape Virgin Mary and having observed a smoke on shore and a number of guanicoes feeding in the vallies they came to an anchor The next day they again sailed and at length anchored about two miles from the shore near the place where they had seen smoke the preceding day The Commodore observed a number of men on horseback riding to and fro opposite the ship and waving something white which he took to be an invitation to land and as he was anxious to know what people these were he went in one boat with a party of men well armed the first Lieutenant with a separate party following in another When they came near the shore they saw a great number of people on horseback and some on foot the whole amounting as they judged to five hundred who were drawn up on a stony point of land that ran far into the sea Though the Commodore did not observe that they had any weapons he made signs for them to retreat a little which they readily did and kept shouting very loud while the crew were landing which was no sooner done than they were mustered on the beach with their officers at their head  Mr Byron now advanced alone but as he approached the Indians retreated he therefore made signs that one of them should come forward which was complied with The person who advanced appeared to be a chief and was very near seven feet in heighth round one of his eyes was a circle of black paint and a white circle round the other the rest of his face was painted in streaks of various colours He had the skin of a beast with the hair inwards thrown over his shoulders The Commodore and the Indian having complimented each other in language equally unintelligible to either they walked together towards the main body of the Indians few of whom were shorter than the height abovementioned and the women were large in proportion Mr Byron made signs for them to sit on the ground which they did chanting in a most serious and melancholy tone The eyes of any one face were never painted with the same colours some being white and red some black and red and some black and white their teeth were white and even they were all dressed much alike but that some of them wore a sort of boots having a spur of peaked wood fastened to each heel  The Commodore having prevailed on some who were still galloping about to alight and sit down with the rest he distributed some white and yellow beads among them which they very  Commodore Byron Conversing with a Patagonian Woman  gladly accepted He then took a piece of ribband and giving the end of it into the hands of the first Indian he continued it to the next and so on as they sat to the end of the ribband He then cut it with a pair of scissars between every two of them and tied each man's share round his head which they did not attempt to remove It was remarked that though the presents were insufficient to supply them all no one pressed forward from the station assigned him nor seemed to envy the superior good fortune of his neighbour  Among these gigantic people one woman who was of the largest size and most disagreebly painted had her hair adorned with beads of blue grass hanging in two divisions down before her shoulders and she had bracelets of pale gold or brass on her arms but there was no learning how she obtained this finery One of the men shewed Mr Byron the bowl of a tobacco pipe made of red earth and made signs that he wanted some tobacco none of which they had among them On this the Commodore beckoned to the seamen who still remained drawn up on the beach three or four of whom instantly running forward the Indians were alarmed and jumping up in an instant were preparing to retire as it was supposed to fetch their arms Mr Byron therefore ran and stopped the sailors directing one of them only to come forward when he had got all the tobacco  they could muster among them This restored peace and all the Indians resumed their places except an old man who sung a long song to Mr Byron at nearly the conclusion of which Mr Cumming the first Lieutenant brought the tobacco This gentleman tho' six feet two inches high was himself astonished at the diminutive figure he cut among the strangers who were broad and muscular in proportion to their height The Commodore having distributed the tobacco they made signs for him to ride to their huts but he intimated that he must return to the ship on which they sat down again apparently much concerned Their horses though not large were active and much under command their saddles were like an English pad and the bridle was formed of a thong of leather with the bit made of wood they had no stirrups and both men and women rode astride When the Commodore left them they kept their seats not once offering to follow him  On the st of December they began sailing up the Streight of Magellan with a view to take in a proper stock of wood and water as the finding Falkland's Islands was yet a matter of uncertainty They remarked a single Indian on this shore who waved his hand to them till he lost sight of the ship they likewise saw several guanicoes on the hills On the evening of the d six Indians came on the beach hallooing  and making signs that they wished an acquaintance with the crew but as the seamen were fatigued the Commodore would not send off a boat to them On the th they saw a point of land near St George's Island to which Mr Byron gave the name of PORPOIS POINT  Having anchored at ten at night the Commodore went the next morning in quest of wood and water plenty of which they found on the point abovementioned A fine level country lies over the point the soil of which appeared to be very luxuriant producing innumerable flowers of several kinds the smell of which was extremely fragrant there was also a plenty of good grass among which grew peas that were then in blossom They saw hundreds of painted geese so called from their beauty which were feeding among this variety of sweets they likewise found an abundance of plants and wild celery in great quantities Many Indian wigwams were seen situated in the woods near streams of water these had been lately occupied as the fires appeared but just burnt out In a walk of twelve miles they saw no place proper for a boat to land the sea breaking high on the shore Mr Byron returned in the evening and found that some of the men had been shooting geese teal and snipes while others had employed themselves with equal success in fishing these employments indeed became necessary as the men  could have eaten thrice their allowance owing to the keen air of the country  On the th they steered for Port Famine and came to an anchor close to the shore the next day at noon In this place they found drift wood enough to have supplied a thousand vessels The Commodore went four miles up Sedger river but could proceed no farther the trees which had fallen across the stream impeding the boat's way one of the stumps of them having made a hole in her bottom she was immediately filled with water but they made shift to get her on shore and stopped the leak so as to return in her to the mouth of the river The banks of this stream are furnished with the noblest trees sufficient in number to supply masts for the whole navy of Great Britain Some of these were so large that four men joined hand in hand could not enclose them and among the rest the pepper tree was found These woods abound in parrots and other beautiful birds The quantity of fish that was daily taken was equal to the supply of both the crews and the Commodore shot as many geese and ducks as furnished several tables besides his own  While the ships lay at anchor here Mr Byron and a party went on shore but being catched in a violent rain they stopped where some Indians had left a fire the wood of which was yet warm and kindling a fire to dry their  cloaths another fire was instantly made on Terra del Fuego the opposite shore which they imagined to be a signal on a supposition they were Indians The hills were craggy of an amazing height and wholly covered with snow but the plains were adorned with flowers equal in fragrance and beauty to those in the gardens of England  The Commodore having ordered a tent to be erected on the borders of a wood and adjoining to a rivulet three of the sailors were there stationed to wash linen and they laid in the tent One evening soon after they had retired to rest they were awakened by the deep and hollow roarings of some wild beasts which came nearer them every moment Terrified with apprehension they made and kept up a blazing fire round which the beasts walked at a small distance till the dawn of the morning when they retired  Near where the ships rode at anchor was a hill cleared of wood which they imagined to have been a Spanish settlement mention of which is made in Captain Wallis's Voyage as will be seen in the course of this work Both ships having taken in sufficient wood and water by the th of January they sailed at four o'clock in the morning in quest of Falkland's Islands but the wind dying away they were obliged to come to an anchor the day following  On Sunday the th they again made sail and the Commodore who had been twentyfour hours on deck retired to sleep but he was soon awakened by the vessel beating on a bank Happily at this instant it was a perfect calm so that the rising of the tide soon carried the ship safe off again On the th the officer of the watch discovered that the head of the mainmast was sprung which they supposed to have happened in a violent gale some time before but effectual methods were immediately taken to repair the damage  On the th they saw land which was taken for De Wert's Islands and at the same time other land to the south which was judged to be what is called New Islands in the charts This land consists chiefly of mountainous and barren rocks on which were great numbers of birds Seals abound here and large whales were seen spouting round the ship On the th they saw a flat island covered with tufts of grass as large as bushes and on the following day the Commodore sent a boat from each ship to examine an opening which had the appearance of an harbour which being discovered they stood in for it in the afternoon and found it excellent beyond their most sanguine hopes Soon after this they entered another harbour to which Mr Byron gave the name of Port Egmont from the title of the nobleman at that time First Lord of the Admiralty This harbour  map of Africa  is represented to be the finest in the world and capacious enough to contain the whole navy of England in full security there is plenty of fresh water in every part of it and geese ducks snipes and other edible birds abound in such numbers that the sailors were tired with eating them The geese were knocked down with stones so that it was no unusual thing for a boat to bring off sixty or seventy of those birds without the necessity of shooting a single one Seals and penguins abound here sea lions of a prodigious size are found on the coast and there is plenty of muscles cockles clams and limpets The woods produce sorrel and wild celery in great abundance  The Commodore was once unexpectedly attacked by a sea lion and extricated himself from the impending danger with great difficulty they had many battles with this animal the killing of one of which was frequently an hour's work for six men one of them almost tore to pieces the Commodore's mastiff dog by a single bite The Master having been sent to sound the coast four very fierce animals ran after the boat's crew till they were up to their bellies in water so that they were obliged to put from the shore as they had no firearms in the boat The next day on the opposite shore Mr Byron and his company saw a sea lion of an enormous size and the crew being well armed instantly engaged him While they were thus  employed one of the other animals posted towards them but a ball being lodged in his body he was instantly dispatched Five of these beasts were killed this day in their attempts to seize the men whom they always pursued the moment they got sight of them They were of a mixed shape between a wolf and a fox most like the latter but of the size of the former They burrow in the ground like a fox feed on seals and penguins and are very numerous on the coast The sailors in order to be rid of such disagreeable companions set fire to the grass which burnt so rapidly that the country was all in a blaze for some days and these animals were seen running to seek shelter from its fury  While they lay in this harbour the crew breakfasted on portable soup and wild celery thickened with oatmeal which made a very nutritive mess The soil of the island was a light clay under a black mould The Commodore thinks this the same place which in Cowley's Voyage is called Pepys' Island but he took possession of the harbour and all the adjacent islands by the name of FALKLAND'S ISLANDS for George the Third King of Great Britain It is to the honour of the Surgeon of the Tamar frigate that during their stay there he made a fence of turf near the watering place round a tract of land which he planted with  vegetables for the use of those who may hereafter touch at this port  On Sunday January the th they left Port Egmont and the same day saw a remarkable headland which was named CAPE TAMAR soon after which they passed a rock which Mr Byron called the EDISTONE and then sailed between that and a headland to which he gave the name of CAPE DOLPHIN The distance from Cape Tamar to Cape Dolphin is about eight leagues and from its appearance was called CARLISLE SOUND though it is since known to be the northern entrance of the streight between the two principal islands The land seen during the course of this day was all downs having neither trees nor bushes but large tufts of grass in various places  Having anchored during the night they sailed again the next day when the Commodore gave the name of BERKLEY'S SOUND to a deep sound between the islands About four miles to the southward of the south point of this sound the sea breaks very high on some rocks that appear above water The coast now wore a dangerous aspect rocks and breakers being at a considerable distance from the shore and in all directions and the country appeared barren and desolate The sea now rising high the Commodore sailed to the northward to prevent being driven on a leeshore He imagines the whole  circumference of Falkland's Islands to be little less than miles  At eight in the evening they stood to the westward and held their course till the th of February when they saw and stood in for Port Desire at the mouth of which they came to an anchor and had the pleasure of seeing the Florida a storeship which they had expected from England On Thursday the Master of the storeship went on board the Dolphin and informed the Commodore of the extreme bad condition of his ship on which it was resolved to attempt the unloading her in the harbour though a place very ill calculated for the purpose They therefore entered the harbour but the night proving very tempestuous the Tamar and the Florida both made signals of distress having been driven from their moorings up the harbour On this and the following night they were both saved from driving on shore and as the storeship was in constant danger of being lost Mr Byron sent hands on board to assist in repairing her and resolved to take her with him into the Streight of Magellan before he unloaded her In this harbour the rudder of the Dolphin was likewise repaired there being no timber proper for making her a new one  On the th the Florida put to sea with orders to steer directly for Port Famine and on the next day she was followed by the Dolphin and Tamar The three following days they saw  map of the Straits of Magellan  A CHART of the STRAITS of  MAGELLAN  a strange vessel following them which shaped her course and sailed faster or slower exactly as they did a circumstance that caused much speculation The Commodore being obliged to wait for the Florida which was far astern imagined the stranger would speak with him and therefore made the necessary dispositions to give her a proper reception When he came to an anchor the stranger did the same four miles to windward of him but in the morning she was seen three leagues to the leeward She now got under way and approached the Dolphin on which the Commodore got eight guns which were all that could be come at to one side of the ship as he lay at anchor Neither party hoisted any colours but about this time the storeship running aground the strange vessel hoisted French colours and sent two boats with an anchor to assist her The Commodore now sent a boat from each of his ships to the assistance of the Florida with positive orders not to let the French boats board her but to acknowledge in a proper manner the offer of assistance These orders were obeyed and the storeship was got off  They weighed anchor at six in the evening and anchored again at eleven at which time the French vessel did the same but in a situation that shewed her ignorance of the channel they were in  On the th they again sailed and as the French vessel steered after them Mr Byron thought they came from Falkland's Islands where there was then a French settlement to take in wood or that they were on a survey of the Streight of Magellan in which they were now sailing On the th they reached Port Famine when the Dolphin and Tamar having taken as much provision out of the storeship as they could find room for the Master received orders to sail for England as soon as possible it being determined to navigate the other ships through the Streight  On the th they passed the French ship which was in a small cove and near her a large quantity of wood which the Commodore had no doubt was intended for their new settlement On Mr Byron's return to England this appeared to be the fact and that the ship was commanded by Mons Bougainville and called the Eagle  The rest of the account of their passage thro' the Streight of Magellan consists chiefly of the names of places and descriptions of soundings bearings and distances which could not fail of proving unintelligible if not disgusting to the generality of readers Whatever is really worth the notice of those who read either for instruction or entertainment shall be faithfully recited in the following pages  The mountains on both sides of the Streight are covered with snow from the top to the bottom  are steep and craggy and of a most desolate appearance On the st of March two or three canoes of Indians followed the ship one of which went on board This canoe was of bark and wretchedly made it contained some men women and a boy who had bows and arrows which they exchanged for beads and other trinkets the cord of the bow was made of the gut of some beast dried and the arrows were formed of a reed pointed with a green stone These people had no other garment than a sealskin thrown over their shoulders and they made on the whole a most wretched appearance When the ship came to an anchor several of the Indians went on board and gladly accepted some ribbands beads and other trifling matters with which the Commodore presented them These people subsist chiefly on muscles and berries some of the latter of which they gave Mr Byron when he returned their visit on shore  Having narrowly escaped the dreadful effects of a storm on the d of March boats were repeatedly sent out till the th in search of a proper place to anchor in and at length the Dolphin was moored in a little bay opposite Cape Quod and the Tamar which could not work up so far about six miles to the eastward of it This part of the Streight being only four miles over its appearance is dreary and desolate beyond imagination owing to the prodigious mountains on each side of it which rise above  the clouds and are covered with perpetual snow On the th they met with a large number of shellfish and on this day the Commodore went up a deep lagoon under a rock at the head of which was a fine fall of water and on the east side of it several small coves calculated for the secure reception of ships of the greatest burden  On the th an officer was sent in a boat in search of an harbour and in two days he returned with an account that there were five bays between the ship and Cape Upright in any one of which they might anchor securely While this officer was absent he met with some Indians who made him a present of a dog and one of the women having a sucking child offered to give it him At this time winter commenced with all its severity and the hills were soon covered with snow The cold became so intense that the seamen whose clothes were continually wet suffered severely to fortify them against this inclemency of weather the Commodore gave a warm jacket of woollen stuff called fearnought to the crews of both ships officers included  On the th perceiving they lost ground on every tack they came to an anchor but finding the ground to be rocky they weighed again and every man on board was on deck the rest of the day and the whole night during which time the rain poured down on them in unremitting torrents Notwithstanding this incessant labour  The Wolf Fox of Faulklands Islands  they found in the morning that they had been only losing way owing to the rapidity of the current They were now glad to anchor in the very bay they had left two days before  As it continued to rain and blow violently for two days longer the Commodore sent a boat to sound the bay on the north shore but no anchorage could be found On the th the vessel was driven from her moorings but by heaving up the boweranchor and carrying out another they soon restored her to her situation After labouring all day on the st they had gained only two miles on the current when they came to an anchor but the sea running high they sailed the day following and the current now running to the westward they made great way and in the evening anchored in a commodious bay where the Tamar had arrived before them It is remarkable that notwithstanding the late severity of the weather added to their incessant labour the crew retained both health and spirits  On the d they again set sail and in a few hours had sight of the South Sea which rolled a prodigious swell on them On the th two boats which had been sent in search of anchoringplaces returned with an account that they had found two but neither of them very eligible they however made sail the next morning and at four in the afternoon found themselves within a mile of the south shore which  the thickness of the weather prevented their seeing sooner but as there was no place to anchor in they stood for the opposite shore Between six and seven the Tamar was ordered under the stern of the Dolphin and then directed to keep ahead of her during the night to show lights and as often as she varied her tack to fire a gun At seven in the evening the weather cleared for a minute so that they had sight of the northshore bearing west by north on which they instantly tackedabout The wind now blew a perfect hurricane the rain descended in torrents some of the sails were torn to rags and during this tempestuous night in which the sea was continually breaking over them the ships parted company and were encompassed with rocks and breakers however they happily weathered the storm and at seven in the morning both ships came to an anchor They had now been twice within four leagues of Tuesday's Bay at the western mouth of the streight and twice driven ten or twelve leagues back again by storms so dangerous is the navigation of this streight at an improper season of the year  On the th the Tamar narrowly escaped being dashed to pieces against the rocks by the parting of the cable to her best boweranchor The Dolphin weighed anchor the next morning and got under sail which she had no sooner done than signals of distress were made on  board the Tamar the anchor of which could not be purchased The Dolphin therefore stood again into the bay and sent her the proper assistance after which they both anchored for the night a night the most dreadful they had yet known The winds were so violent as perfectly to tear up the sea and carry it higher than the heads of the masts a dreadful sea rolled over them and broke against the rocks with a noise as loud as thunder Happily they did not part their cables or they must have been dashed in pieces against these rocks  On the following day April st it was almost a perfect calm but in the evening it rained much and the wind blew violently they therefore remained in their station till the th when the cutter which had been sent in search of a proper anchoringplace returned with an account of having found such place to the west of the northshore  The officer who commanded the cutter had met with a party of Indians whose canoe was of a construction not observed before being composed of planks sewed together These Indians had no covering but a piece of sealskin thrown over their shoulders Their food which was of the most indelicate kind was eaten raw one of them tore a piece of stinking whale's blubber with his teeth and then gave it his companions who followed his example One  of these Indians observing a sailor asleep cut off a part of his jacket with a sharp flint  The ships soon came to an anchor in the bay which had been discovered proposing to take in wood and water While they remained here several of the natives made a fire opposite the ship on which signals were made for them to come on board but as they would not the Commodore went on shore and gave them some trifles which pleased them highly he likewise divided some biscuit among them and was surprized to remark that if a bit of it fell to the ground not one of them would stoop to take it up without his permission some of the sailors being at this time cutting grass for a few sheep which the Commodore had on board the Indians instantly ran to their assistance and tearing up the grass in large quantities soon filled the boat On Mr Byron's return they followed in their canoe till they came near the ship at which they gazed with the most profound astonishment Four of them were at length prevailed on to go on board and the Commodore with a view to their diversion directed one of the midshipmen to play on the violin while some of the seamen danced the poor Indians were extravagantly delighted and one of them to testify his gratitude took his canoe and fetching some red paint rubbed it all over the face of the musician nor could the Commodore but with the utmost difficulty  escape the like compliment When they had been diverted for some hours it was hinted to them that they should go on shore which they at length did tho' with evident reluctance  They sailed from this bay on the th and on the th again encountered very bad weather as it rained and snowed while the wind blew a hurricane On the th they passed some dangerous rocks which in Narborough's Voyage are called the Judges and on which the surf beats with prodigious violence This day contrary to expectation a steady gale at southwest carried them at the rate of nine miles an hour so that by eight in the evening they were leagues from the coast on which they had encountered so many perils  The Commodore recommends it to future navigators to be at the eastern entrance of the Streight of Magellan in December in which case he thinks even a fleet of ships might navigate it safely in about three weeks He observes that the facility with which wood and water are to be obtained the vast plenty of vegetables on the coast and the abundance of fish which may be almost every where procured are advantages highly in favour of this passage It is remarkable that in seven weeks and two days the time they were in passing it not a single man was sick of the scurvy or any other disorder  On the th they sailed westward bearing away for the Island of Masafuero which they were within seven leagues of the same evening The next day they bore away for the north of the Island and then lay by for the boats which had been sent to found the eastern side but could not land for the violence of the surf The boats returning brought a number of fine fish which had been catched with the hook and line and the officer reporting that he had found a bank where they might anchor and opposite to which was plenty of fresh water they made sail for this bank on which they anchored at o'clock on Sunday morning The boats were now sent out for wood and water their crews having put on corkjackets to assist them in swimming and prevent their being bruised against the rocks In these seas were a great number of very large sharks which were frequently very near the swimmers but they providential escaped them One of these voracious fish seized a large seal close to one of the wateringboats and devoured it in an instant and the Commodore saw another do the same close to the stern of the ship The island abounds in goats many of which were killed and sent on board and they were deemed equal in flavour to the finest venison One of the goats had his right ear slit so as to make it evident that some person had caught him given him that mark of distinction and let him go  again Various sorts of excellent fish were now so plenty that they could catch sufficient to supply the whole crew two days in a few hours with hook and line only  The gunner and one of the seamen who were with others on shore for water were left behind all night being afraid to venture in the boat as the sea ran high The Commodore being informed of this circumstance sent them word that as blowing weather might be expected the ship might be driven from her moorings in the night in which case they would infallibly be left behind This message being delivered the gunner swam to the boat but the sailor saying he had rather die a natural death than be drowned refused to make the attempt and taking a melancholy farewell of his companions resolved to abide his fate when just as the boat was going to put off a midshipman took the end of a rope in his hand and swam on shore where he remonstrated with the poor tar on the foolish resolution he had taken till having an opportunity of throwing the rope in which was a running knot round his body he called to the boat's crew who instantly dragged their companion on board but he had swallowed so much water that he appeared to be dead They recovered him however by holding up his heels and on the day following he was perfectly well  The Commodore now made a promotion among the officers he appointed captain Mouat captain of the Dolphin under him making Mr Cumming the first lieutenant of the Dolphin captain of the Tamar and advancing some other inferior officers  They sailed on the th of April steering in various directions till the th of May on which and the day following they saw several dolphins and bonettas round the ship and observed a few birds which had a short beak all their bodies being white except the back and the upper part of the wings They saw several grampuses the next day and more of the birds just mentioned from whence they concluded that they approached some land Two remarkable birds as large as geese with white bodies and black legs and which flew very high were observed on the th from whence it was conjectured that they had passed some mainland or islands On the d they saw several tropic birds and caught two bonettas and on the th two large birds the beak and neck of which were white and all the rest black flew about the ship On the th two other birds one black and white and the other brown and white would have settled on the yards but were intimidated by the working of the ship For several days after they saw great numbers of birds and on the th of June they discovered land being then in fourteen degrees  five minutes south latitude and degrees minutes west longitude  The Commodore now steered for a small island the appearance of which was pleasing beyond expression being surrounded by a beach of fine white sand and covered with lofty trees which extending their shade to a considerable distance and having no underwood formed the most elegant groves that the imagination can paint an idea of Several of the natives soon appeared having long spears in their hands who made large fires which were answered by corresponding fires on an island to the windward A boat was sent to look out for an anchoringplace but none was to be found At this time many of the best hands were confined to their hammocks with the scurvy while those who were able to keep the deck looked and languished for those reinvigorating delicacies which were unhappily beyond their reach The shells of turtle were strewed along the shore and they beheld numbers of cocoanuts to the milk of which fruit the scurvy seldom fails to yield The inhabitants of this island kept abreast of the ship dancing and shouting they sometimes shook their spears and then falling backwards lay motionless as if dead which was understood to be a threat of destruction to such as should presume to land They likewise fixed two spears in the sand on the top of which were fastened some things which  waved in the air before these they kneeled and appeared as if invoking the assistance of the Deity against the supposed invaders The Commodore was tempted from its very appearance to sail round the island while he was doing which he again sent out boats to sound on which the natives made a most hideous outcry took up and balanced large stones in their hands and pointed to their spears The sailors on the contrary made every possible sign of friendship throwing bread and other things on shore which they would not touch but retired to the woods dragging their canoes after them This being done they ran into the water watching as for an opportunity to drag the boat on shore The seamen irritated at this behaviour would have fired on the Indians but were restrained by command of the officer on board  The crew of the boats having again reported that no anchorage could be found the Commodore proceeded to the other island and on the next morning brought to at three quarters of a mile from the shore Several other islands were now seen covered with the cocoanuttree The natives again ran to the beach armed with clubs and spears using threatening gestures The Commodore fired a cannonshot over their heads on which they retreated to the woods The boats having been again sent out returned with an account that no  landingplace could be found on which Mr Byron named this paradise in appearance the ISLANDS OF DISAPPOINTMENT The natives are stout and well made very quick runners and their complexion is that of the deep copper  Having sailed on the th of June they discovered an island on the day following which laid low and was covered with various kinds of trees among which was the cocoanut the island was surrounded with a rock of red coral The inhabitants on the coast having made large fires as supposed to alarm the more inland natives they ran along the shore in multitudes armed like those of the Islands of Disappointment The vessels now brought to at a small inlet opening into a lake of salt water which appeared more than two leagues wide At this place was a little town under the shade of a grove of cocoanuttrees The ships advancing to the mouth of the inlet some hundreds of the natives headed by a kind of officer who carried a pole on which was fastened a piece of mat ranged themselves up to the waists in water making a hideous noise till they were joined by a number of large canoes which came down the lake At this time two boats were out in search of soundings and the crews of them making every possible sign of friendship some of the canoes drew towards them not indeed as we hoped with a peaceable intention but with a view to haul the boats on  shore several of the natives leaping from the rocks swam to the boats and one of them sprang into the Tamar's boat snatched up a seaman's jacket and instantly dived from the boat to the shore another of them laid violent hands on a hat but lost his prize through his ignorance as he pulled it downwards instead of lifting it from the head  They now sailed westward and soon discovered another island distant four leagues The natives pursued them in two large double canoes in each of which were about thirty armed men At this time the boats were at a considerable way to leeward of the ships and were chaced by the canoes on which the Commodore making a signal the boats turned towards the Indians who instantly pulled down their sails and rowed away with great rapidity they drove through the violent surf on the shore and were followed by the boats when apprehending the invasion of their country they armed themselves with stones and clubs on which the boat's crew fired and killed two or three of them one of whom died as he was throwing a stone at his enemy after three balls had gone thro' his body  Horrid wanton murderIf discoveries are to be purchased at such a price the southern hemisphere had better have remained unknown  This poor fellow dropping close to the boats his body was brought to the ship but the Indians carried off the rest of their  companions The boats carried the two canoes with them as the trophies of their scandalous victory These vessels consisted of planks sewed together with a strip of tortoiseshell fixed over each seam they had sharp bottoms and were very narrow and two of them were fastened alongside each other by two timbers which left a space of full six feet between the canoes a sail made of neat matting passed from one vessel to the other being fixed to a mast which was hoisted in each of them when they sail several men sit on the timbers which lay from boat to boat their cordage appeared to be formed of the outer covering of the cocoanut and was exquisitely well made  As no refreshments could be obtained owing to the violence of the surf the Commodore returned to his former station at the inlet and again sent the boats in search of an anchoringplace A number of the Indians were on the spot were he had left them and were loading some large canoes most probably to attack the boats on which a shot was fired over their heads and they instantly ran away and secreted themselves The boats returned in the evening with a few cocoanuts and in the morning were sent out again with all the invalids who were able to go in them The Commodore went on shore this day and saw many Indian huts which were covered with the branches of the cocoanuttree they were mean buildings but finely situated  among groves of lofty trees The men went naked but some women were seen who wore a kind of cloth from the waist to the knee The shore abounded with coral and the shells of large pearl oysters and 'tis probable a valuable pearlfishery might be established here There were many dogs in the huts who kept barking constantly till our adventurers went on board  The next day the seamen found in one of the huts the carved head of a rudder which had evidently belonged to a Dutch longboat they likewise found a piece of brass another of iron and some iron tools but by whom these things were left is wholly unknown  The burialplaces of the natives were under high trees near their houses and their tombs consisted of fl  st  laid on perpendicular side stones like those in the churchyards of England On the branches which shaded these repositories hung baskets of reeds containing the heads and bones of turtle and other fish and near the graves were several boxes filled with human bones  The flies on this island were extremely troublesome but no venomous creature was seen Parrots and other birds were very plentiful and they saw some beautiful doves so tame as to follow them into the huts of the Indians The water of the island is good and the surface of the ground is almost covered with scurvygrass  This part of the island is situated in degrees minutes south and degrees minutes west  On Wednesday June the th they sailed to another island and as they coasted along it the natives armed as those of the other islands kept even with the ship for some leagues They frequently plunged into the sea or fell on the sand that the surf might break over them to cool and refresh themselves The boats being near the shore the crew made signs that they were in want of water on which the natives pointed farther along the shore where when the boats arrived they saw a number of houses and whither they were followed by the Indians many more of whom joined them at this place The boats having got close in shore and the ships laying at a small distance a venerable old man with a white beard advanced from the houses to the beach attended by a young fellow Having made a signal for the other Indians to retire he came forward to the edge of the water pressing his beard to his breast with one hand and holding a branch of a tree in the other He now made a kind of musical oration during which the people in the boat threw him some trifling presents which he would neither take up nor permit his attendant to touch till he had finished his harangue when he walked into the water and throwing the branch to the boat's crew he retired and picked  up their presents Most of the natives having complied with a sign made for them to lay down their arms one of the Midshipmen swam ashore on which they flocked round him admiring his cloaths as his waistcoat pleased them most he gave it to them which he had no sooner done than one of them untied his cravat and ran away with it He now thought it time to retreat to the boat whither several of the natives swam after him some bringing each a cocoanut and others fresh water in the nutshell The boat's crew had taken with them some shells of the pearl oyster in order to learn of the natives how to procure some pearls but they could not possibly make them comprehend their meaning This island is situated in degrees minutes south latitude and degrees minutes west longitude and both the islands the Commodore called KING GEORGE'S ISLANDS in respect to his Sovereign In a lake belonging to the last island two or three very large vessels were seen one of which had two masts with proper cordage  The boats having returned on board they sailed westward the same day and the next afternoon descried another island towards which they immediately sailed and found that it was well inhabited and had a fine appearance of verdure but that a violent surf broke all along the coast It lies in degrees south and  degrees minutes west and received the name of the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLAND  They now sailed northward From the vast flocks of birds they had repeatedly seen which always winged their way to the south on the approach of evening and from the islands being so well peopled the Commodore concluded that there was a chain of islands leading to a continent the discovery of which he would certainly have attempted but the crews of both ships were so unhealthy as to render it impossible for us to succeed  On Monday June the th they concluded that land was near from the multitudes of birds which flocked about the ship but they saw no land till the st when it was discovered at eight leagues distance having the appearance of three islands with rocks between them These islands abounded with inhabitants whose dwellings lined the coast and the beauty and fertility of the soil seemed to excel that of any place they had seen but the rocks and breakers with which it was surrounded were an insuperable bar to any attempt at landing On the night of the st all hands were on deck as it rained hard and the wind blew violently Soon after nine o'clock the Tamar fired a gun and the crew of the Dolphin imagined they saw breakers to leeward but it proved to be only the undulating reflection of the setting moon on the waters  On the th they discovered another island which was named the DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND A terrible sea breaks round the coast but the place itself had a pleasing appearance The boats landed with some difficulty and brought off a large quantity of cocoanuts which were a great relief to the sick Thousands of seafowls were found sitting on their nests in high trees and were so tame as to be easily knocked down and there were great numbers of landcrabs on the ground This island has a large lake in the midst of it but has no inhabitants  On the th they sailed northward with a view to cross the equinoxial line and then sail for the Ladrone Islands On the d of July they discovered a low flat island abounding with the cocoanut and other trees and affording a most agreeable prospect A great number of the natives were seen on the beach many of whom in above sixty canoes or proas sailed and formed a circle round the ships which having surveyed for a considerable time one of the Indians jumped out of his boat swam to the ship ran up its side in a moment sat down on the deck and began laughing most violently he then ran about the ship pilfering whatever he could lay hands on which was taken from him as fast as stolen This man having as many antic tricks as a monkey was dressed in a jacket and trowsers and afforded exquisite diversion He devoured some biscuit with great eagerness  and having played the buffoon some time made prize of his new dress by jumping over the side of the ship and swimming to his companions Several others now swam to the ship and running up the side to the gunroom ports committed some petty theft swimming off with their booty with surprising expedition These Indians are of a bright copper with regular and chearful features and are tall and wellmade Their hair which is long and black is either tied in three knots or in a large bunch behind Their ears were bored and they certainly had worn heavy ornaments in them as some of them were drawn down almost to their shoulders their ornaments were shells strung together and worn round the waist wrist and neck but they were otherwise naked One of them who seemed to be of some rank wore a string of human teeth round his waist Some of them carried a long spear the sides of which for the length of three feet were stuck with the teeth of the shark which are as keen as a razor Some cocoanuts being shewn them and signs made that more were wanted they endeavoured to steal those instead of directing where more might be found  The officers named this place BYRON'S ISLAND in honour of the Commodore It lies in degree minutes south latitude and degrees minutes east longitude They sailed from hence on the d of July on the st of which month the men again grew ill of the scurvy  having eaten up all the cocoanuts which are perhaps the best cure for this disorder in the world Several of the people were also troubled with fluxes owing to the extreme heat of the weather On the d they sailed for the island of Tinian being nearly in the latitude of that place and six days afterwards they had sight of the islands Saypan Tinian and Aiguigan which lie between two and three leagues from each other At noon on the st they anchored at the southwest end of Tinian in the situation where the Centurion had anchored with Commodore Anson The water is so wonderfully clear at this place that though feet deep they could see the ground  The Commodore went on shore where he saw many huts which had been left the preceding year by the Spaniards and Indians Having chosen a spot on which to erect tents for the sick Mr Byron and his company with prodigious difficulty worked their way through the woods in search of those elegant meadows and lawns of which so enchanting a picture is given in Anson's Voyage but to their unspeakable mortification they found the lawns covered with reeds in which their legs were entangled and cut as with whipcord and these reeds were in some places higher than their heads and in none less than half that height From head to foot they were covered with flies which got down their throats as often as they  opened their mouths In this excursion they killed a bull and then retiring to the tents which had been erected in their absence they sent a party to fetch home their prize  The invalids having been brought on shore the preceding day they on the st of August began clearing the well which Mr Byron supposes to be the same that the Centurion watered at but he says the water was brackish and full of worms While they lay here the wind once drove in so violently from the west that the ships were obliged to put to sea for a week to avoid being dashed against the rocks The armourer's forge was brought on shore to repair the ironwork of the ships and the Commodore had a tent erected as he was very ill of the scurvy The crew recovered apace from the scurvy but many of them were seized with fevers of whom two died being the first they had lost since they left England The rains were violent and almost perpetual and the heat so intense that the thermometer on board the ship generally stood at only degrees less than the heat of the blood at the human heart Innumerable insects tormented them and they were perpetually infested by musquitos in the night and flies by day The island swarms also with black ants centipieds and scorpions  Parties were sent out to kill cattle which after being absent three days and nights and killing a bullock had seven or eight miles to drag  it through the woods and lawns and when i  arrived it was commonly flyblown and stunk intolerably add to this that the extreme toil of this duty brought on fevers which confined the men to their tents They killed poultry with ease but the heat was so excessive that it would turn green and swarm with maggots in less than an hour after it was killed They killed wild hogs that weighed pounds each which afforded them their chief supply of fresh meat A negro belonging to the Tamar contrived a method to ensnare these animals so that they sent many on board alive and were thus always certain of having fresh meat both in the ship and on shore  A spot having been found where cattle were plentiful a party was sent to kill them having a tent erected for their use and boats were sent daily to bring away what they killed three of the crew of the Tamar were lost in this service by the violent breaking of the sea upon the rocks Bread was now baked every day for the use of the sick and upon the whole they were well supplied with provisions  The island of Saypan is not only larger but pleasanter that Tinian It is in a great degree covered with trees and abounds with hogs and guanicoes It is conjectured that the Spaniards at stated periods carry on a pearlyfishery at this island as there were evident signs of people  having been lately there and large heaps of the oystershells were seen  The Commodore remained at Tinian till the th of September by which time the sick being tolerably well recovered he weighed anchor and stood to the northward This island produces plenty of cotton and indigo with cocoanuts breadfruit guavas paupaus sour oranges and limes  On the th of October several landbirds apparently much fatigued flew near the ship one of which of the size of a goose rested on the booms its legs and beak were black but every other part white and the beak was of a most monstrous length and thickness On the th they saw a number of trees and bamboos floating near the vessel which was then in fathom water On the th of November they came to an anchor off the Island of Timoan on which Mr Byron landed the day following The inhabitants who are Malays no sooner saw the boat making for the shore than many of them came to the beach each having a dagger by his side a spear in one hand and a long knife in the other The boat's crew however made no hesitation to land and bartered a few handkerchiefs for a goat a kid and a dozen of fowls  The Malays are of a copper complexion well made but of small stature They wore turbans on their heads and pieces of cloth fastened  with a silver clasp round the waist but one old man among them was habited nearly in the Persian fashion Their houses which are raised on posts eight feet from the ground are composed of the bamboo slit and are very neatly constructed The island produces the cocoanut and cabbagetrees in great abundance and there are some rice grounds on it While the ships lay at anchor some of the inhabitants brought a living animal on board which had legs like that of a deer with a body like a hare which proved to be very fine eating The crews catched large quantities of fish in this harbour from whence they sailed on the th of the month  Nothing worth notice happened till the th when a sloop being seen at anchor in the harbour of an Island named Pulo Toupoa Mr Byron having anchored in the same harbour and observed that the vessel hoisted Dutch Colours sent an officer on board her who was received with great politeness tea being immediately made for him and his attendants but he could not make himself understood the crew consisting entirely of Malays This vessel which was made of slit bamboo had a piece of timber on each quarter which served to steer her instead of a rudder  The Commodore sailed the following day and held his course till the th when he spoke with an English Snow bound from Bencoolen  to Malacca and Bengal in the East India Company's service At this time their biscuit was filled with worms and rotten and their beef and pork was stinking The master of the Snow being apprized of this circumstance sent Mr Byron two gallons of arrack a turtle twelve fowls and a sheep which is supposed to have been the half of his stock and for which he refused to accept the slightest return They dropped their anchors this day in the road of Sumatra and on the th came to an anchor in that of Batavia  Having anchored nearer the town on the following day they fired eleven guns which were returned and an English ship from Bombay fired guns in honour of the Commodore  The Dutch Commodore sent his boat on board the Dolphin under the command of his cockswain who made but a shabby appearance He put several questions to Mr Byron respecting his voyage and destination and took a book from his pocket to write down his answers which Mr Byron considering as an indignity desired him instantly to leave the ship which he did not think proper to hesitate at doing  Mr Byron visited the Dutch Commodore at his country house was received with great politeness and told that he might take a house in any part of the city or be lodged at the hotel Any inhabitant of Batavia permitting a stranger to sleep though but for a single night  in his house incurs a penalty of dollars the hotel being the only I censed lodging house the Governor appoints the keeper of it who at this time was a Frenchman This hotel is the most superb building in the city having more the air of a palace than an inn All the streets of Batavia are well disposed and having canals running through them resemble the cities of Holland The inhabitants are a motley herd of Dutch Portuguese Chinese Persians Moors Malays Javanese c and their numbers are amazingly great The Chinese live in a kind of separate town without the city walls and deal very largely having annually ten or twelve vessels laden from China The roads for several miles round the city are very wide and have a canal shaded with trees running by them wh  ch is broad enough for the navigation of large vessels Adjoining to this canal are the countryhouses and gardens of the citizens  The ships remained in this harbour till the th of December when they sailed being saluted with eleven guns by the fort and thirteen by the Dutch Commodore During their run from  ence to Prince's Island in the Streight of Surda they were so abundantly supplied with turtle by boats from the Java shore that the common sa  lors subsisted wholly on that fish They  at Prince's Island till the th when they sailed for the Cape of Good Hope  On the th of February they saw a great smoke arising from a sandy beach which they supposed to have been made by the Hottentots On the th they came to an anchor and the next morning the Governor sent his coach and six for the Commodore and received him with great politeness offering him the accommodations of the company's house in the garden and the use of his coach The Cape is a fine country situated in a healthy climate and abounding with various kinds of refreshments In a paddock adjoining the Company's garden which is extremely elegant ostriches zebras and other curious birds and animals are constantly kept The Commodore frequently gave his men permission to go on shore and they as constantly returneddrunk with the Cape wine  They sailed on the th of March and on the th crossed the equinoctial line About this time an accident happening to the rudder of the Tamar and it being impossible to make a perfect repair of it at sea the Captain was ordered to bear away for Antigua in consequence of which they parted company on the first of April and the Dolphin without meeting with any other material occurrence came to an anchor in the Downs on the th of May after having been rather above twentytwo months in the circumnavigation of the globe  CAPTAIN WALLIS's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD  SAMUEL WALLIS  Esq  having been appointed to the command of his Majesty's ship the Dolphin which was destined for a Voyage round the World he sailed down the river on the th of July and came to an anchor in Plymouth Sound on the th of August three days after which he received sailing orders and directions to take under his command the Swallow sloop and Prince Frederick store ship These vessels sailed on the d and on the th of September in the evening came to an anchor in the road of Madeira The next morning Captain Wallis saluted the Governor with guns and the compliment was returned with an equal number  They sailed thence on the th after having taken in beef wine and onions as seastores On the th as they were sailing off the Island of Palma at the rate of eight miles an hour the wind suddenly died away so that the vessels lay quite still On the th they catched several bonettas out of a great number which surrounded the ship and this day they saw some herons flying to the eastward The Swallow which was a bad sailer parted from the other vessels in the night between the st and d but she joined  company again on the th within six leagues of the Isle of May This day the three vessels came to an anchor in Port Praya in the abovementioned island and the next morning they obtained leave from the commanding officer at the fort to get water and other necessaries This being the sickly season there and the smallpox being very fatal the Captain detained every man on board who had not had that distemper  They here catched great quantities of fish and having procured cattle and water and found some wild purslain that was very refreshing they sailed on the th and in the night saw the burning mountain on the peak of Fuego Captain Wallis now ordered every man to be furnished with hook and line that he might supply himself with fish and likewise to prevent infection commanded that no man should keep his fish above twentyfour hours On the th they began to serve the crews with oil all the butter and cheese being consumed and orders were issued that during the remainder of the voyage they should be served with vinegar and mustard once a fortnight On the d they judged that they were within degrees of land from the sight of a great number of birds Two days after this orders were given for serving the men with brandy the wine being reserved for those that were ill On the th the Prince Frederick sprung a leak and her crew were at this time so sickly through the fatigue of  pumping and the badness of their provisions that her commander Lieut Brine was apprehensive he could not keep company much longer except some assistance could be given him The Captain sent a carpenter and six sailors on board but he was unable to supply her with better provisions As the carpenter found he could do little toward stopping the leak in the storeship the Dolphin and Swallow compleated their provisions from her stores and put on board her the empty oil jars staves and iron hoops  By the th of November they were in degrees of south latitude when they found the weather so cold as to have recourse to their thick jackets On the th at eight o'clock at night they saw a meteor which flew horizontally from northeast to southwest leaving a train of light which made it as bright as at midday on the deck From the th to the d they saw whales seals snipes plover and other birds and some butterflies On the th of December they saw land and on the th remarked that the sea appeared coloured by the immense quantities of red shrimps that surrounded the ship  On the th being very near Cape Virgin Mary they saw several men riding on the shore who made signs for them to land Having come to an anchor they observed that the natives remained opposite the ship all night shouting aloud and keeping up large fires In the morning the Captain went on shore with a boat's  crew from each ship and having made signs for the Indians to sit down he gave them combs buttons knives scissars beads c and pleased the women greatly by the distribution of some ribbands He then intimated that he should be glad to accept some guanicoes and ostriches in exchange for billhooks and hatchets which he shewed them but they were either really or designedly ignorant of his meaning The tallest among these people was six feet seven inches several others were from one to two inches shorter but the general height was from five feet ten to six feet They were muscular and well made but their hands and feet very small in proportion to the rest of their bodies They were dressed in the skin of the guanico with the hairy side to their bodies and some of them wore a square piece of cloth made of the hair of the guanico and a hole being cut to admit the head through it reached down to the knees they wore likewise a kind of buskin from the middle of the leg to the instep which was also conveyed under the heel but the rest of the foot was bare their hair which was strait and coarse was tied back with a cotton string and their complexion was the dark copper They rode on horses about fourteen hands high and had dogs of the Spanish kind both men and women rode astride and the men were furnished with wooden spurs some of the men had their arms painted the faces of others were variously marked and others  again had the left eye enclosed by a painted circle Their arms were two round stones enclosed with leather one of which was fastened at each end of a string eight feet in length and one stone being held in the hand the other was swung round the head with great force for some time and then discharged at any mark they chose to strike They likewise catch guanicoes and ostriches by means of this cord which is thrown so that the weight twists round and hampers the legs of the intended prey Some of them were observed to devour the paunch of an ostrich raw having only turned the inside outwards and shook off some of the filth  These people who are great talkers were often heard to say  Capitane  on which they were successively addressed in Portuguese Spanish Dutch and French but they had no knowledge of either of those languages When they shook hands with any of the crew they always said  chevow  and they were amazingly ready in learning English words and pronounced the sentence  "Englishmen come on shore"  with great facility  As they seemed desirous of going on board the Captain took eight of them into the boats on which they instantly began singing for joy but when they came into the ship they expressed no kind of surprize at the novelties they beheld till a lookingglass being observed they acted many antic gestures before it occasionally  walking to and from it talking with earnestness and laughing immoderately They would drink nothing but water but they eagerly ate every article of the ship's provisions They were highly pleased with some turkies and guineahens which were on board nor did the hogs and sheep escape their attention One of them making signs that he should be glad of some cloaths the Captain gave him a pair of shoes and buckles and presented the rest with a little bag each in which he put new sixpences and halfpence with a ribband passed through a hole in them to hang round their necks the remaining contents of the bag were a lookingglass a comb some beads a knife a pair of scissars some twine and a few slips of cloth being offered some tobacco they smoked a few minutes but did not seem to like it The marines being exercised before them they were terrified at the firing of the muskets and one of them falling down shut his eyes and lay without motion as if to intimate that he knew the destructive nature of those weapons  It was with difficulty that they were at length prevailed on to go on shore and one of them would not leave the ship till he had sung a long kind of prayer and even petitioned to stay till evening by pointing to the sun and then moving his hand round to the western horizon As soon as they were in the boat they began to sing and did not cease till they reached the shore  where many of their companions pressed eagerly to be taken into the boat and were highly affronted at being refused  This day they turned into the Streight of Magellan with the floodtide and saw many people on horseback hunting the guanicoes which ran up the country with prodigious swiftness The natives lighted fires opposite the ships and in the morning about of them with their horses feeding near them were observed in a valley This being the spot where Mr Byron saw the Patagonians some officers were sent towards the shore but with orders not to land as the ships were too far off to assist them in case of necessity When they came near the land many of the natives flocked towards them among whom were women and children and some of the very men they had seen the preceding day these waded towards the boat frequently calling out  "Englishmen come on shore"  and were with difficulty restrained from getting into the boat when they found the crews would not land Some bread tobacco and toys were distributed but not an article of provisions could be obtained in return  On the d the tide was so violent that the ships were driven three several ways but in the evening they were safely anchored On Christmasday they procured a quantity of celery from Elizabeth Island which being boiled with portable soup and wheat the crews breakfasted  on it several days Many huts were found on this island and two dogs were seen but the Indians had quitted it for the present Many high mountains were observed which though it was then the midst of summer were in a great degree covered with snow  On the th they anchored in Port Famine Bay and the sick were sent on shore where a tent was erected for their reception as was another for the accommodation of the sailmakers and those who landed to get wood On the th the empty watercasks were landed and on this day great quantities of fish were catched among which were smelts When they arrived here many of the people were very bad with the scurvy but by the plentiful use of vegetables and bathing in the sea they all recovered in a very short time  All hands were now employed in repairing and storeing the ships and thousands of young trees were carefully taken up with the mould about them to be carried to Falkland's Islands which produce no timber  On the th of January the Master of the Dolphin who had been in search of anchoringplaces returned with an account that he had found such as were proper for the purpose and this day the Prince Frederick sailed for Falkland's Islands  They sailed on the th and came to an anchor the next day half a mile from the shore  opposite a current of fresh water that falls rapidly from the mountains As a more convenient anchoringplace and at the same time better adapted for procuring wood and water had been discovered they sailed again the next day and on the d came to an anchor in the bay near Cape Gallant where they catched wild ducks in such numbers as to afford them a very seasonable relief Near this spot are very high mountains one of which was climbed by the Master of the Swallow with the hope of getting a view of the South Sea but being disappointed in his expectation he erected a pyramid and having written the ship's name and the date of the year he left the same with a shilling within the structure  On the th they saw an animal that was as swift as a deer and had a cloven foot but in other respects it was like an ass Near this spot the country has a most forbidding aspectthe mountains on both sides the Streight are of a stupendous height the lower parts of them are covered with trees above which a space is occupied by withered shrubs higher up are fragments of broken rock and heaps of snow and the tops are totally rude naked and desolate  On the evening of the th they saw a great smoke on the southern shore and another on Prince Rupert's Island and the next morning some people being sent on shore for water they had no sooner landed than several of the natives  came off in three canoes and having advanced towards the sailors made signs of friendship which being answered to their wish they shouted aloud and the English shouted in return When the Indians came up they were eating the flesh of seals raw and were covered with the skins which stunk intolerably They had bows arrows and javelins the two last of which were pointed with flint These people were rather low of stature the tallest of them not exceeding five feet six inches and their complexion was the deep copper colour  Three of these people being taken on board the Dolphin they ate whatever food was offered them but like the Patagonians would drink only waterlike them too they were highly diverted with a lookingglass in which they at first looked with astonishment till having become a little more familiar with it they smiled at its effect and finding a corresponding smile from the figure in the glass they burst into most immoderate fits of laughter  The Captain going on shore with them presented some trinkets to their wives and children and received some of their arms and pieces of mundic of the kind found in the tin mines of Cornwall These Indians went off in canoes the sails of which were made of the sealskin  The ships sailed on the d of February and came to an anchor in York Road on the same day The next morning Captain Wallis with  a party went on shore near Batchelor's River and saw many Indian huts and several dogs which ran away the moment they were noticed they likewise saw ostriches and collected various kinds of fish and vegetables There is a cataract near this river the noise of which is tremendous as it falls more than yards partly over a very steep descent and partly in a perpendicular line  They sailed on the th and came to anchor again the same day in York Road after having lost ground by the contrary winds The next morning they were driven with such violence by the current as to be in momentary expectation of being dashed against the rocks from which they were frequently not half the length of the ship but they were providentially preserved and came to an anchor in BUTLER'S BAY which was so called from the name of one of the mates who discovered it They kept this station till the th when they encountered a most violent storm attended with hail and rain which increased till the evening the sea breaking over the forecastle upon the quarterdeck yet as the cables did not part they were again wonderfully preserved from destruction They remained here eight days taking in wood and water and repairing the little damage the ship had sustained in the storm They catched fish of various kinds among which were muscles near six inches in length and procured plenty  of vegetables The mountains in this neighbourhood had the most rugged and desolate appearance but their height could not be ascertained as their heads were lost in the clouds and some of them on the southern shore were so exceedingly desolate as not to produce even a single blade of grass while the vallies were equally barren and almost covered with snow  On the st of March they sailed again and anchored on the same day in a bay which they called LION'S COVE from whence they sailed on Monday and on the five following days encountered such terrible weather that they had no prospect before them but that of immediate destruction and the crew on board the Dolphin were so prepossessed that the Swallow could not ride out the storm that they imagined they saw some of her hands coming over the rocks towards them  The storm at length subsided but the weather being intensely cold each of the men was furnished with a thick jacket made of the woollen stuff called Fearnought During a week which they remained at this place they were at twothirds allowance brandy excepted  On the th both ships were safely anchored in a place called SWALLOW HARBOUR from whence they sailed the next morning and on the following day the Swallow being driven among breakers made signals of distress but she was happily relieved by a breeze from the shore  This day the waves ran high and there was so thick a fog that they narrowly escaped shipwreck among a number of small islands but the weather clearing up a little in the afternoon they came safely to an anchor in a bay under Cape Upright  On the th two canoes having on board several Indians came alongside the Dolphin who had with them a quantity of seal's flesh blubber and penguins which they ate without any kind of dressing A seaman having catched a fish bigger than a herring gave it to one of them who killed it by a bite near the gills and instantly devoured it These people would not drink any liquor but water but they eagerly ate provisions of any kind boiled roasted raw salt or fresh Though the weather was very cold they had no covering but a sealskin and even that they did not wear when they were rowing It was remarked that they had all sore eyes probably occasioned by the smoke of their fires and they lived in such a nasty way that they smelt as rank as a fox They had a kind of javelin pointed with bone which they used in striking fish The Captain presented them with a few baubles with which they departed well satisfied  Twentytwo of the sailors staying one night on an island thirty of the natives hurried to their boat and began to make free with its contents but the sailors had just time to hinder  their depredations which enraging them they ran to their canoes and armed themselves with poles and javelins but the sailors giving them some small presents peace and harmony were soon restored  The th of the month proving a fine day they employed themselves in drying the sails of the ships which were damaged by having been long wet Several Indians went on board the next day and proved to be the people which the boat's crew had seen on shore  On the st of April some of the natives brought several of the birds called Racehorses which they sold to the sailors The next day eight Indians brought six of their children on board whom the Captain gratified with bracelets and necklaces These people were exceedingly tender in the treatment of their children and a circumstance happened which proves that they are not less delicate in other respectsA boat was ordered on shore to get wood and water at this time some of the Indians were on board and others in their canoes alongside the ship the latter eyed the boat attentively and on her putting off called aloud to their companions who without speaking instantly handed down the children and jumped into the canoes which were hurried after the boat while the Indians cried out in a most distressful tone When the ship's boat was near land some women were seen among the rocks to  whom the Indians called out aloud and they all ran away but the boat's crew having remarked their jealous fears lay on their oars to convince them that no injury was intended The Indians landed drew their canoes on shore and hastily followed the objects of their affection  On the th at the request of the Surgeon orders were given that no more muscles of which they had hitherto collected plenty should be brought on board as the crew began to be troubled with fluxes On the th the two ships sailed in company and on the th they lost sight of each other and did not meet again during the whole voyage This day the Dolphin cleared the Streight of Magellan in which she had laboured with innumerable difficulties and escaped most imminent dangers in a passage of almost four months viz from December the th to the th of April  Captain Wallis now proceeds to a description of the places in which the ships anchored during their passage through the Streight but as a minute recital of bearings distances and soundings would be unintelligible to most of our readers and possibly disgusting to them all we shall omit these particulars extracting only such anecdotes as may furnish real improvement or entertainment  In the year the Spaniards built a town which they named Phillipville and left in it a  colony of four hundred persons These were all starved to death except twentyfour all of whom but one proceeded in search of the river Plata and most probably perished as no tidings were ever heard of them the remaining man whose name was Hernando was taken on board by Sir William Cavendish in the year and brought to England and the place was called Port Famine from the melancholy fate of these unfortunate men Wood and water abounds at this place geese ducks teal c are in great abundance and there is no want of fish so that the face of things must be greatly changed since the Spaniards died there of hunger  Cape Holland Bay where fish are catched in great plenty and the adjacent country produces plenty of cranberries and wild celery but there are no birds At Cape Gallant Bay there is wood water vegetables and fish as there is also at Elizabeth's Bay and York Road Butler's Bay abounds with rockfish muscles wildfowls c Lion Cove and Goodluck Bay produce scarce any thing but wood and water Muscles and rockfish are found at Swallow Harbour the mountains round which are desolate beyond description Upright Bay produces excellent water and some wildfowl and fish  On Sunday the th of April they held a westward course during which a number of sheerwaters pintadoes gannets and other birds  flew about the ship the upper works of which being open and the cloaths and bedding constantly wet the sailors in a few days were attacked with colds and fevers The th of this month proving a fine day the sick were brought on deck and nourished with salop and portable soup in which wheat was boiled The violent gales soon returned so that the beds were again wet through and it was feared that the ship would lose her masts they therefore began to think of altering their course in hope of better weather and the rather as the number of sick encreased so fast that there was danger of soon wanting hands to navigate the vessel  Nothing material happened from this time till the th of May when something appeared to the eastward which looked like high land towards which a flock of brown birds were observed to fly they therefore steered all night for this supposed land but at daybreak could see no signs of it As the weather now mended the people recovered very fast and the carpenters were busied in caulking the upperworks of the ship and repairing the boats On the st they saw a number of flyingfish and on the day following tropic birds bonettas and dolphins About this time those who had recovered from colds were attacked with the scurvy on which some sweetwort was extracted from malt for their use and they were supplied with pickled cabbage and wine instead of  brandy Two grampuses were seen on the th and on the day following variety of birds one of which was taken for a landbird and resembled a swallow Every method of cleanliness and change of food was now taken to prevent the scurvy which began to encrease very fast  On the first of June they saw several men of war birds and the next day observed some gannets and the weather being at this time very various they conceived hopes that they drew near the land On the th a turtle swam close by the ship and the next day a great variety of birds were seen  The long wishedfor relief was now fast approaching for on Saturday the th the man at the masthead cried  "Land in the westnorthwest"  This proved to be a low island distant five or six leagues and was soon seen from the deck to the great joy of every one on board When they came within five miles of this island they discovered another to the westnorthwest Two boats were sent to the first discovered island under the command of the second Lieutenant the crews being well provided with arms When the boats came near the island two canoes were observed to put off to the other island The crews having landed gathered some cocoanuts and collected a quantity of scurvygrass with which they returned to the ship bringing with them some fishhooks which the islanders had formed of oystershells In this excursion  they saw three huts supported on posts and open all round but thatched with cocoanut and palm leaves ingeniously wrought together As no anchorage was to be found and the whole island was encompassed with rocks and breakers the Captain resolved to steer for the other island giving the name of WHITSUN ISLAND to this because it was discovered on the eve of Whitsunday  Having approached the other island about of the natives armed with pikes and some having firebrands in their hands were observed running on the coast Two boats were sent out manned and armed and the Lieutenant was instructed to steer for that part of the shore where the people had been seen to avoid offending them and to try to procure water and fruit in exchange for such commodities as he took with them When the boat came near the shore the natives put themselves in a position as if they would defend it with their pikes but the crew making signs of friendship and exposing their trinkets some of the Indians walked into the water to whom it was hinted that some cocoanuts and water would be acceptable which was no sooner done than they fetched a small quantity of each which they ventured to bring to the boats and received some nails and other trifles in exchange While they were dealing one of the Indians stole a silk handkerchief  with its contents but the thief could by no means be discovered  The next morning the boats were again dispatched with orders to land if they could do it without offence to the natives As they approached the shore they observed seven large canoes each with two masts laying ready for the Indians to embark in them these having made signs to the crew to proceed farther and this being done the Indians embarked and sailed westward being joined by two canoes at another part of the island These canoes two of which were lashed together appeared to be feet in length four in breadth and three in depth The people had long black hair hanging over their shoulders were of a dark complexion and of the middle size They were dressed in a kind of matting made fast round the middle and it was remarked that the women were beautiful and the men justly proportioned  The Lieutenant being again sent on shore the Captain commanded him to take possession of the island in the king's name and to call it QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLAND The boats returned loaded with cocoanuts and scurvy grass after having found two wells of excellent water Provisions for a week were now allotted for a mate and twenty men who were left on shore to fill water the sick were landed for the benefit of the air and a number of hands were appointed  to climb the cocoatrees and gather the nuts  On the th the water was brought on board the ship but the cocoanuts and vegetables which the cutter was bringing off were lost by the rolling of the waves which almost filled her with water On this island were found several tools resembling adzes awls and chissels which were formed of shells and stones The dead bodies were not buried but left to decay above ground under a kind of canopy  The ship sailed this day after taking possession of the islands for the king in testimony of which they left a flag flying and carved his majesty's name on a piece of wood and on the bark of several trees For the use of the natives they left shillings sixpences halfpence bottles nails hatchets and other things It should be remarked that on this island they found the very people who had fled from Queen Charlotte's Island with several others in the whole near one hundred It lies in degrees minutes south latitude and degrees minutes west longitude and received the name of EGMONT ISLAND  On the th they observed about sixteen persons on an island which was called GLOUCESTER ISLAND but as it was surrounded with rocks and breakers they did not attempt to land This day they likewise discovered another which was called CUMBERLAND ISLAND and on the  day following a third which received the name of PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY'S ISLAND  On the th they again discovered land and at ten at night saw a light which convinced them that it was inhabited and remarked that there was plenty of cocoatrees a certain indication that there was no want of water  The day following an officer was sent to the shore with instructions to exchange some toys for such things as the island produced He saw a great number of the people but could find no place in which the ship might anchor Some of the Indians who had white sticks in their hands appeared to have an authority over the rest While the Lieutenant was trafficking with them an Indian diving into the water seized the grappling of the boat while his companions on the shore laid hold of the rope by which she was fastened and attempted to draw her into the surf but their endeavours were frustrated by the firing of a musket on which all parties let go their hold These Indians were dressed in a kind of cloth a piece of which was brought to the ship  From the number of the people seen and their having some large double canoes on the shore it was thought that there were larger islands at no great distance the Captain therefore having named this place OSNABURGH ISLAND made sail and having soon discovered  high land came to an anchor because the weather was very foggy  Early the next morning they saw land distant or leagues but after having sailed towards it some time thought it prudent again to anchor on account of the thickness of the fog but it no sooner cleared away than they found the ship encompassed by hundreds of canoes in which were many hundreds of people Having approached the ship they behold it with wonder and talked with great earnestness Some baubles were now shewn them and signs were made for them to come on board on which they rowed the canoes towards each other and a general consultation took place at the conclusion of which they all surrounded the ship with an appearance of friendship and one of them delivered an oration at the conclusion of which he threw into the sea the branch of a plantaintree which he had held in his hand This being done a young Indian of more apparent courage than the rest ventured on board the ship The Captain would have given him some baubles but he refused the acceptance of them till those in the canoes came alongside and having held a consultation threw on board several branches of the plantaintree Others now ventured on board but it was remarked that they all got into the ship at some improper part not one of them even by accident finding the right place of  cent  A goat belonging to the ship having ran his horns against the back of one of the Indians he looked round with surprize and seeing the animal ready to renew the attack he sprang over the ship's side and was instantly followed by all his countrymen Their terror however soon subsided and they returned to the ship and the sheep hogs and poultry being shewn them they intimated that they possessed the two latter species The Captain now gave them nails and other trifles and made signs that he wanted hogs fowls and fruit but they could not comprehend him They were detected in several attempts to take away any thing they could lay hold of but one of them at length jumped overboard with a laced hat snatched from one of the officers  The inner parts of the island abound in hills cloathed with timber trees above them are high peaks from which large rivers descend to the sea The houses when seen at a distance resemble a barn having no shelter but a roof the land towards the sea is level and produces the cocoanut with variety of other fruits and the face of the whole country is picturesque beyond description  They now sailed along the shore while the canoes which could not keep pace with them made towards the land In the afternoon the ship brought to and the boats being sent to sound a bay that promised good anchorage the  Indian canoes flocked round them The Captain apprehensive that their designs were hostile made a signal for the boats to return to the ship and fired a gun over the heads of the Indians Though they were frightened at the report they attempted to prevent the return of the cutter but she easily outsailed them This being observed by some canoes in a different station they intercepted her and wounded some of her people with stones which occasioned the firing a musket and some shot were lodged in the shoulder of the man who began the attack which the Indians observing they all made off with the utmost precipitation  The boats having reached the ship preparations were made for sailing but a large canoe being observed to make towards her at a great rate it was resolved to wait the event of her arrival on which an Indian making a speech threw a plantainbranch on board and the Captain returned the compliment of peace by giving them a branch which had been left on board by the other Indians some toys being likewise given them they departed with much seeming satisfaction  They now sailed and the next morning were off a peak of land which was almost covered with the natives and their houses On the st the ship came to an anchor and several canoes came alongside of her bringing a large quantity of fruit with fowls and hogs for which  they received nails and toys in exchange The boats having been sent to sound along the coast were followed by large double canoes three of which ran at the cutter staved in her quarter and otherwise damaged her the Indians at the same time armed with clubs endeavouring to board her The crew now fired and wounding one man dangerously and killing another they both fell into the sea whither their companions dived after them and got them into the canoe They now tried if they could stand or sit but as the one was quite dead they laid him at the bottom of the canoe and the wounded man was supported in a sitting posture The ships boats now kept on their way while some of the canoes went ashore and others returned to the ship to renew their merchandize  While the boats continued out in search of soundings the natives swam off to them with water and fruit The women were particularly urgent for the sailors to land and pulling off all their cloaths gave hints of the most indelicate nature how acceptable their company would be  The boats being sent on shore with some small casks to get water the Indians filled two of them and kept all the rest for their trouble When the boats came off the shore was crouded with thousands of men women and children During this time several canoes remained alongside the ship but the Captain would not  permit a single Indian to go on board as there was no guarding against their artful disposition  On the d the natives brought hogs poultry and fruit to the ship which they bartered for knives and other things so that the whole crew was supplied with meat for two days by means of this traffick The boats having been this day sent for water every inducement was used by the inhabitants to persuade them to land and the behaviour of the women was still more lascivious than before Having procured a small quantity of water the boats put off on which the women shouted aloud pelted them with apples and bananas and shewed every mark of contempt and detestation  The ship made sail the day following with intention to anchor off the wateringplace but the man at the masthead discovering a bay a few miles to the leeward they immediately stood for it The boats which were ahead making a signal for anchorage they prepared to bring to but when the ship had almost reached the boats she suddenly struck and her head remained immoveably fixed on a coral rock in which situation she remained near an hour when she was happily relieved by a breeze from the shore During the whole time that she was in danger of being wrecked she was encompassed by hundreds of Indians in their canoes but not one of them attempted to board her The  ship was now piloted round a reef into an harbour where she moored  The Master was then sent to found the bay and found safe anchorage in every part of it In the mean time some small canoes brought provisions on board but as the shore was crouded with large canoes filled with men the Captain loaded and primed his guns supplied his boats with musquetoons and kept a number of the men constantly under arms  On the th the ship sailed up the harbour and was followed by many canoes bringing provisions which were exchanged for nails knives c In the evening a number of very large canoes advanced laden with stones on which the Captain ordered the strictest watch to be kept At length some canoes came off with a number of women on board who being brought almost under the ship began to practise those arts of indelicacy already mentioned During this singular exhibition the large canoes came close round the ship some of the Indians playing on a kind of flute others singing and the rest blowing a sort of shells Soon after a large canoe advanced in which was an awning on the top of which sat one of the natives holding some yellow and red feathers in his hand The Captain having consented to his coming alongside he delivered the feathers and while a present was preparing for him he put back from the ship and threw the branch  of a cocoatree in the air This was doubtless the signal for an onset for there was an instant shout from all the canoes which approaching the ship threw vollies of stones into every part of her On this two guns loaded with small shot were fired and the people on guard discharged their muskets The number of Indians now round the ship were full two thousand and though they were at first disconcerted they soon recovered their spirits and renewed the attack Thousands of the Indians were now observed on shore embarking as fast as the canoes could bring them off orders were therefore given for firing the cannon some of which were brought to bear upon the shore This firing put a stop to all hostilities on the part of the Indians for a small time but the scattered canoes soon got together again and having hoisted white streamers advanced and threw stones of two pounds weight from slings by which a number of the seamen were wounded At this time several canoes approached the bow of the ship from whence no shot had been yet discharged In one of these was an Indian who appeared to have an authority over the rest a gun was therefore levelled at his canoe the shot of which split it in two pieces This put an end to the contest the canoes rowed off with the utmost speed and the people on shore ran and concealed themselves behind the hills  The Captain now failed for his intended anchoringplace and moored the ship within a small distance of a fine river The next morning some persons who had been sent to survey the shore returned with an account that the river produced fresh water and that there was not a single canoe to be seen  This day a Lieutenant was dispatched with all the boats manned and armed and a number of marines with orders to land under cover of the ship and boats which being effected he turned a piece of turf and having hoisted a pendant on a staff he took possession of the place for his Sovereign by the name of KING GEORGE THE THIRD'S ISLAND He then mixed some rum with the river water and every person present drank the King's health At this time the Lieutenant observed two old men on the opposite side of the river who seemed much terrified and assumed a posture of supplication Signs were made for them to cross the river which one of them having done he crawled on his hands and knees towards the Lieutenant who shewing him some stones that had been thrown at the ship hinted that the Indians should receive no harm if they were not the aggressors Some hatchets were now produced to intimate that they wished to barter for provisions and some trifling matters were given to the Indian who testified his joy and gratitude by dancing round the pendant He then plucked  some branches of trees which he laid on the ground and retreated but soon returning with several others they advanced towards the pendant which happening to be shaken by the wind they ran back with evident signs of astonishment They soon recovered from their surprize and procuring two hogs laid them down at the foot of the flagstaff and danced round it after which they put the hogs into a canoe and the old Indian rowed it to the ship when he came alongside he delivered a serious oration in the course of which he handed up a number of plantainleaves one at a time this being done he rowed back after refusing several presents that had been offered him  In the night a number of lights were seen on the coast and the noise of drums and other instruments of music was heard Soon after daylight it was observed that the Indians had left the coast and taken away the pendant This day while a party was engaged in filling the water casks the old man who had been seen the day before crossed the river and brought with him some fowls and fruit The Captain who was indisposed on board the ship employed himself in remarking what was going forward on shore and by the help of glasses he saw many of the Indians creeping behind the bushes towards the wateringplace while incredible numbers were coming through the woods and a large party descending a hill all advancing to the same  spot and two divisions of canoes were making round the opposite points of the bay The Lieutenant seeing his danger got his party on board the boats but not before he had sent the old Indian to prevail on the others to keep at a proper distance as he wanted only waterbut this had no effect and as soon as the crews were in the boats the natives possessed themselves of the casks as lawful prize Those at some distance from the wateringplace pushed forward with all speed keeping pace with the canoes which were rowed at an extraordinary rate while a great number of women and children were seated on a hill from whence they could command a view of all that passed  When the canoes came near that part of the bay where the ship rode they took in many people from the shore who were laden with bags filled with stones All the canoes now approached the ship on which the Captain gave orders to fire on the first cluster of them that should assemble this had such an effect that they all rowed off with the utmost speed They then fired into several parts of the wood on which the Indians all fled to the hill where the women and children were so that several thousands were now on that spot The Captain being resolved to make this action decisive fired towards the hill and two balls falling near a spot where many of these poor Indians had stationed  themselves they were all terrified beyond descr  ption and disappeared in an instant  When this disagreeable skirmish was ended the boats were hoisted out and a strong guard sent with the carpenters who had orders to destroy every canoe they could find and this service was performed with such alacrity that in a few hours a great number of these vessels were cut in pieces several of which were of the largest size Some fruit fowls and hogs were found in a few of the smallest but the rest were laden with stones and slings  It was not long before a small party of Indians advanced to the seashore and sticking up some small branches of trees went back to the woods but they came again repeatedly bringing with them a quantity of the cloth they wear and some dogs and hogs with their legs tied all which they laid on the shore making signs to the sailors to take them A boat being sent on shore the hogs were conveyed on board but the other articles left In return for these presents several hatchets and nails were left on the beach and signs made to some of the Indians within sight to come and take them which they neglected to do for some time till the Captain having sent for the cloth the natives then accepted his presents with apparent satisfaction  On the th while a party was getting water the old man beforementioned appeared on the opposite side of the river and having harangued  them some time he came over when the officer pointing to the bags and stones which had been brought down tried to convince him that his countrymen had injured the English who had acted only on the defensive His meaning seemed to be well understood but the old Indian could not admit the force of his argumentson the contrary he expressed very forcibly by his countenance voice and actions the high sense he had of the injury offered his unhappy friends At length a reconciliation took place the old man shook hands with and accepted some presents from the Lieutenant who tried to convince him of his goodwill hinted that the natives should not appear but in small parties and that while the boats crews were on one side of the river they should remain on the other The old man departed with evident signs of being content with these terms and in a few hours the natives began a traffic which proved highly advantageous to the ship's company  The sick were now sent on shore and lodged in a tent near the wateringplace under the care of the Surgeon This gentleman having snot a wildduck it dropped near some Indians on the opposite side of the river who were so terrified that they instantly fled but stopping within a short space he prevailed on one of them to bring over the duck which he at length complied with and laid it at the Surgeon's feet  while his looks expressed the fear and agitation of his mind At a second shot three ducks were killed which gave the natives such an idea of the effects of a gun that to this circumstance is chiefly attributed the regularity of their behaviour in all their transactions while the English remained among them  Orders were now issued that the gunner should transact all matters of trade between the Indians and the sailors with a view to prevent pilfering and quarrelling the natives indeed would sometimes steal a trifle but the very sight of a gun procured instant restitution of it The old Indian having been attached to the English was very useful in the recovery of the stolen goods One day an Indian swam over the river and took a hatchet on which the gunner made preparations as if he would go in search of the thief but this being intimated to the old man he immediately went after the lost goods which he brought back The gunner now demanded that the culprit should also be produced and the old Indian complied though much against his inclination The prisoner who had committed other robberies was sent on board the ship whence the Captain discharged him without farther punishment than the terror arising from his situation His countrymen were transported with joy to see him come back and he was conducted into the woods amidst the applausive shouts of his friends This man had  the gratitude to bring a roasted hog and some bread fruit to the gunner next day as an acknowledgment for the lenity shewn him  The Captain First Lieutenant and Purser were at this time very ill so that the care of the vessel and the superintendance of the sick were committed to the Second Lieutenant who discharged his duty with such zeal and fidelity that all was order and decorum Fruit fowls and fresh pork were procured in such plenty that at the end of fourteen days almost every man had perfectly recovered his health  On the th a piece of saltpetre of the size of a small egg was found on shore but whether it had been brought from the ship or not could not be learnt after the most diligent enquiry but no other piece was found on the island  On the d of July they began to want fruit and fresh meat owing to the absence of the old Indian but they had still a sufficient supply for the sick On the d the ship's bottom was examined when its condition was nearly the same as when she left England This day a shark was caught which proved an acceptable present to the Indians  The old Indian who had visited the interior parts of the island in quest of provisions returned on the th and brought with him a roasted hog as a present for the Captain who in return enriched him by putting him in possession of a lookingglass an iron pot c His  return was soon followed by some of the natives who had never yet visited the market these brought some hogs that were larger than any yet purchased  A traffick of a singular kind was now established between the Indian girls and the sailors The price of a lady's favour was a nail or two but as the tars could not always get at the nails they drew them out from several parts of the ship nor could a single offender be discovered by the strictest enquiry The damage done to the ship could be easily repaired but one ill consequence arose from this traffick which could not have been foreseen for on the gunner's offering small nails for hogs the Indians produced large spikes demanding such as those Some of the men made use of a singular device to gratify their passions for when they could procure no more nails they cut lead into the shape of nails and passed it as sterling on their unsuspecting fair ones When the Indians discovered the fraud they demanded nails for the lead but this just demand could not be granted because it would have promoted the stealing of lead and thereby injured the traffic with iron  The sailors in consequence of their connection with the women became so impatient of controul that the Captain ordered the arti+cles of war to be read to awe them into obedience and a Corporal of marines was severely  punished for striking the master at arms The Captain's health being now nearly restored he went in his boat to survey the island which he found extremely delightful and every where well peopled  On the th the woodcutters were entertained in a friendly manner by some Indians who seemed to be of a rank above those they had yet seen and some of these visiting the Captain he laid before them a thirtysix shilling piece a guinea a crownpiece a dollar some shillings new halfpence and two large nails and having intimated that they might take their choice they eagerly seized the nails and then took a few halfpence but left all the other pieces untouched  The Indians now refused to supply the market unless they could get large nails in exchange the Captain therefore ordered the ship to be searched when it was found that almost all the hammocknails were stolen and great numbers drawn from different places on which every man was ordered before the Captain who told them that not a man should go on shore till the thieves were discovered but no good consequence arose from his threats  Three days after this the gunner conducted to the ship a lady of a portly figure and agreeable face whose age seemed to be upwards of forty This lady had but lately arrived in that part of the island and the gunner observing  that she seemed to have great authority presented her with some toys on which she invited him to her house and gave him some fine hogs She was afterwards taken on board at her own desire where her whole behaviour indicated the woman of fine sense and superior rank The Captain presented her with a lookingglass and some toys and gave her a handsome blue mantle which he tied round her with ribbands  Having intimated that she should be glad to see the Captain on shore he signified his intention of visiting her on the following day Accordingly on Sunday the th Captain Wallis went on shore where he was met by his fair friend who was attended by a numerous retinue some of whom she directed to carry the Captain and others who had been ill over the river and thence to her habitation the procession was closed by a guard of marines and seamen As they advanced great numbers of Indians crowded to see them but on a slight motion of her hand they made ample room for the procession to pass  Having come near her habitation many persons of both sexes advanced to meet her whom she caused to kiss the Captain's hand while she signified that they were related to her Her house was above feet in length and about in breadth The roof which was covered with the leaves of the palmtree was supported by a row of pillars on each side and another in the middle The highest part of the thatch  on the inside was about feet from the ground and the space between the sides of the building and the edge of the roof being feet was left entirely open  The Captain Lieutenant and Purser being seated the lady helped four of her female attendants to pull off their coats shoes and stockings which being aukwardly performed the girls smoothed down the skin and rubbed it lightly with their hands for more than half an hour and the gentlemen received great benefit from the operation The Surgeon being heated with walking having pulled off his wig one of the Indians screamed out the eyes of the whole company were instantly fixed on the miraculous sight and they remained some time in the most profound astonishment When they had recovered from their surprize the lady ordered several bales of cloth the produce of the island to be brought out in which she dressed the Captain and all his attendants Orders had been given that the Captain should be carried as before but as he chose to walk she took hold of his arm and when they came near any wet or dirty places she lifted him over with as much ease as a man would a child She attended them to the shore when she took her leave having presented the Captain with a fine sow big with young  On the following day the gunner being dispatched to this lady with a compliment of billhooks  hatchets c found her entertaining many hundreds of the natives who were seated in order round her habitation A mess was ordered for the gunner who reported that it was of an agreeable flavour and seemed to be a compound of fowls and apples shred in small pieces and mixed with saltwater The lady herself distributed the provisions which were served in cocoanut shells and those shells brought in trays by her servants When the company were all fed the lady took her seat somewhat above the rest and was fed by two female servants one standing on each side of her She received the Captain's presents with evident signs of satisfaction  From this period the crew was much better supplied with refreshments hogs and fowls being brought to the market daily but they could not be purchased at the former prices owing to the commerce beforementioned between the sailors and the Indian women the Captain therefore ordered that not one woman should be permitted to come over the river and that no man should leave the ship till he had first been searched  The gunner who was on shore on the th met with the following affecting incident He saw an old woman on the opposite side of the river weeping in a most lamentable manner When she found he regarded her distress she sent a youth to him who having made a long  oration laid a branch of plantain at his feet and then retired and brought over the woman and two hogs The youth now made a still longer speech after the conclusion of which this unfortunate woman made the gunner understand that when the English fired on her countrymen her husband and three of her sons had been killed Her agitation of mind was such that before she had finished her tale she sunk speechless to the ground nor were two lads who attended her in a much better situation The gunner pitied her distress and endeavoured to comfort her At length she became somewhat calmer offered him her hand and directed the hogs to be given him in return he would have given her much more than their value but she would not take the most trifling article  On the th a large party in all the boats rowed round part of the island in order to take a view of it and purchase provisions They returned with a number of hogs and fowls and some plantains and cocoanuts The island was found to be every where very pleasant and to abound with various necessaries of life Great numbers of canoes were seen and several not quite built The tools of the natives were formed of bones shells and stones Dogs and hogs were the only fourfooted beasts The inhabitants ate all their meat either roasted or baked having no vessel in which water could be boiled nor indeed did they seem to have the least idea that  water could be heated by fire this will be proved by the following circumstance While the lady so frequently mentioned was at breakfast on board the ship a person that attended her having observed the cock of an urn turned to fill the teapot he also turned the cock and the scalding water falling on his hand he cried out and danced about the cabin while the other Indians gazed at him with terror and surprize  On the th Captain Wallis received another visit from the lady whom he calls his Queen and this day plenty of refreshments were purchased of some Indians whom they had never dealt with before The Queen repeated her visit on the following day and gave the Captain two hogs and the Master being sent to attend her home she clothed him in the dress of the country as she had done the Captain and his retinue On the th a great number of hogs and pigs with fowls and fruits in the greatest abundance were purchased and sent on board by the gunner The next day one of the sailors was sentenced to run the gauntlet three times round the deck while the crew whipped him with nettles for drawing nails from the ship but the tars were so well disposed to spare a brother in iniquity that his punishment was rather nominal than real this gave rise to an order that no person should go on shore but those appointed to procure wood and water  Captain Wallis's Queen paid him another visit on the st and presented him with some hogs On her departure she invited the Captain to her house who taking some officers with him attended her home On their arrival she tied round their hats some wreaths of plaited hair and distinguished the Captain's by the additional ornament of a tuft of feathers of different colours When they returned she went with them to the waterside and ordered some presents into the boat Just before they put off Mr Wallis intimated that he should finally depart in seven days when she made signs that he should stay twenty but his resolution to depart within the firstmentioned time being repeated she wept incessantly for a considerable time  By the d the ship was so well stored with hogs and fowls that the deck was covered but as they would eat little else than fruit they were killed faster than was otherwise intended A boar and sow of this breed were brought to England and given to Mr Stephens secretary of the admiralty the former of which was living when this account was printed but the latter died in farrowing  On the th the Captain presented his friend the old Indian with cloth and other matters and sent a variety of things to the Queen among which were a cat with kitten turkies geese hens and various kinds of garden seeds which compliment she returned by a present of  fruit and hogs While they remained here they sowed peas and garden seeds and staid long enough to see them come up and likely to thrive  The Captain having sent a party on shore on the th to examine the country minutely caused a tent to be erected to observe an eclipse of the sun and when it was ended he took his telescope to the Queen's house to shew her the use of it and her surprize is not to be expressed on her beholding several objects which she was very familiar with but which were too distant to be seen by the naked eye On the conclusion of this mental feast the Captain invited the Queen and her attendants on board the ship judging that no insult would be offered to the party he had sent out while the principle people were in his power The Queen's attendants ate heartily of an elegant dinner and drank water only but the Queen would neither eat nor drink When the party returned from their excursion the Captain gave orders for landing the Queen and her train She made signs to be informed if he held his resolution as to the time of his departure and being answered in the affirmative her tears witnessed the agitation of her mind  The following is an account of the transactions and observations of the party which was sent out this dayWhen they first landed they called on the old Indian and taking him with  them they walked some on each side of the river about two miles observing that the soil was blackish and rich and that on the borders of the valley through which the river flowed were many houses with gardens walled in and plenty of fruit hogs and fowls They now all walked on one side as the ground rose nearly perpendicular on the other Channels were cut in many places to conduct the water from the hills to the gardens and plantations and the ground being fenced off had a pleasing effect to the eye There was good grass but no underwood beneath the trees the cocoanut and plantain grew on level ground while the breadfruit and apple trees were set in rows on the sides of the hills  The stream now became a perfect meander and the crags of mountains which rose on its borders hung over the heads of our travellers After walking four miles they sat down to breakfast under an appletree when they were alarmed by the shouts of a great number of the natives They would have had recourse to their arms but the old Indian making signs for them to sit still went to his countrymen who became at once silent and instantly retired but they soon returned with variety of refreshments which the old Indian divided among our travellers and for which the Lieutenant gave the natives some buttons and other trifles  They then proceeded and looked diligently for metals and ores in every place likely to produce them but found nothing of any consequence The old Indian growing weary hinted that he should return having first directed his countrymen to clear a passage for the travellers over a mountain When the old man was gone the Indians cut branches from the trees and laid them in a ceremonious manner at the feet of the seamen they then painted themselves red with the berries of a tree and stained their garments yellow with the bark of another By the assistance of the Indians the most difficult parts of the mountain were climbed and they again refreshed themselves on its summit when they saw other mountains so much above them that they seemed as in a valley  Towards the sea the prospect was inexpressibly beautiful the sides of the hills being covered with trees and the vallies with grass while the whole country was interspersed with villages They saw but few houses on the mountains above them but as smoke was observed in many places it was conjectured that the highest parts were inhabited Many springs gushed from the sides of the mountains all of which were covered with wood on the sides and with fern on the summits The soil even on the high lands was rich and the sugarcane grew without cultivation as did likewise ginger and turmerick  The Queen of Otaheite taking leare of Cap  n  Wallis  Having a third time refreshed themselves they descended towards the ship occasionally deviating from the direct way tempted by the pleasant situation of several houses the inhabitants of which entertained them in the most hospitable manner They saw parrots parroquets green doves and ducks The Lieutenant planted the stones of cherries peaches and plums several kinds of gardenseeds and oranges lemons and limes In the afternoon they rested on a delightful spot where the inhabitants dressed them two hogs and several fowls Here they staid till the evening when they rewarded the diligence of their guides and repaired to the ship  On the th the Queen visited the Captain with her usual presents and on this day they discontinued taking in wood and water and prepared for sailing A greater number of Indians now came to the seashore than they had ever yet seen and of these several appeared to be persons of consequence In the afternoon the Queen visited captain Wallis and sollicited him to remain ten days longer but being informed that he should certainly sail on the following day she burst into tears She now demanded when he would come again and was told in days She remained on board till evening when being informed that the boat waited for her she wept with more violence than she had yet done At length this affectionate creature  went over the ship's side as did the old Indian who had been so serviceable to the crew This man had signified that his son should sail with the Captain but when the time of departure came the youth was not to be found and it was thought that parental affection had got the better of the old man's promise  Early the next morning two boats were sent to fill a few casks of water but the officer alarmed at finding the shore crouded with people was about to return This brought the Queen forward who commanded the Indians to retire to the opposite side of the river and then made signs for the boats to land While the water was filling she ordered some presents into the boat and entreated to go once more to the ship but the officer having it in charge not to bring off a single native she ordered her double canoe out and was followed by many others When she had been on board weeping bitterly for an hour advantage was taken of a breeze and the ship got under sail She now tenderly embraced the Captain and Officers and left the ship but the wind falling the canoes all put back and once more reached the ship to which the Queen's being made fast she advanced to the bow of the canoe and wept incessantly The Captain presented her with several articles of use and ornament which she received in silent sorrow After some time a breeze springing up the Queen and her attendants  took their final leave with many tears which drew corresponding tears from the eyes of our countrymen  The place where the ship had lain was called PORT ROYAL HARBOUR and is situated in degrees minutes southlongitude and degrees westlatitude  Captain Wallis now proceeds to give a more accurate account of the inhabitants of Otaheite with their customs manners cThe men are from five feet seven to ten inches high well proportioned alert and of good countenances The women from five feet to five and a half handsome in general but some of them as beautiful as can be imagined The complexion of those men who are much on the water is rather red but the natural colour of them all is the tawny They are remarkably distinguished from all the other natives of Asia Africa and America by the colours of their hair for that of the former is universally black while the people of Otaheite have the various colours of black brown red and flaxen most of the children having the latter when left loose it has a strong natural curl but it is usually worn tied in two bunches one on each side the head or in a single bunch in the middle They anoint the head with the oil of the cocoanut mixed with a root of a fragrant smell  It has been mentioned that the ladies do not consider chastity as a virtue but the price of their favours is always proportioned to their charms When a man offered a girl to the caresses of a sailor he shewed a stick of the size of the nail that was to purchase her company  Their cloaths are formed of two pieces of cloth not unlike coarse China paper in one of which a hole is made for the head to pass thro' and this hangs to the middle of the leg the other piece is wrapped round the body and the whole forms an elegant drapery This cloth is composed of the inner bark of a tree They adorn themselves with pearls shells feathers and flowers They mark the hinder part of the thighs and loins of both sexes with black lines in different forms which is done by striking the teeth of an instrument through the skin and rubbing soot mixed with oil into the holes some few men who appeared to be persons of distinction had their legs marked but neither boys nor girls are marked till after they are twelve years old  An Indian who attended the Queen appearing to be fond of imitating the English was presented with a suit of the Lieutenant's cloaths which became him extremely well As it was shoalwater at the landingplace the English officers were carried on shore and this man unwilling to be out of the fashion was carried in the same manner by the Indians In his attempt  to use a knife and fork at first his hand always went to his mouth while the food remained stuck on the end of the fork  Besides the articles already mentioned these people eat the flesh of dogs Rats abound on the island but are not eaten The river produces parrotfish groopers crayfish and mullet and conchs and muscles are found on the rocks the inhabitants use nets and hooks and lines  There is something singular in their way of dressing their food having produced a fire by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together they dig a pit which being paved with stones they make a fire in it The stones being properly heated they rake away the ashes and covering the stones with green leaves of the cocoa nuttree they put their meat in plantain leaves and place it in the pit covering it over with the hot ashes on which they lay breadfruit and yams enclosed in plantain leaves these again they cover with the embers intermixed with the hot stones to this succeeds a layer of cocoanut leaves and upon the whole is a covering of earth In this manner a small hog is dressed whole but a large one is cut in two and Captain Wallis asserts that this method of cookery exceeds every other he has known the meat being extremely tender and full of gravy Their only sauces are salt water and fruit and their knives are made of shells  They were astonished when they first saw meat boiled in a pot but the Captain having given ironpots to the Queen and some of her chiefs they were often used and the old Indian fed on boiled meat almost constantly The only liquor they drink is water they occasionally pluck and chew a bit of the sugarcane but have no idea of extracting any spirit from it  From the scars with which many of these people were marked it seems evident that they sometimes waged war with each otherThat they have skill in surgery is evident from the following circumstance a splinter having got into the foot of one of the sailors his messmate tried in vain to extract it with a penknife on this one of the natives having formed an instrument with his teeth out of a shell extracted the splinter in an instant and the old Indian applying a piece of the gum of the appletree to the wound the man's foot was quite well in two days  There are several sheds on the island enclosed within a wall on the outside of which several posts are fixed in the ground on which are rude resemblances of men women dogs and hogs The enclosed place is paved with large stones between which the grass grows These were supposed to be burialplaces from the natives being sometimes seen to enter them with an air of solemn sorrowIt could not be discovered  that these people had any kind of religious worship among them  They have three kinds of canoesone formed out of a single tree in which they go a fishing a second made of planks sewed together and large enough to hold or men in which they sail round the island and come laden home with fruits and a third sort which are not unlike the Venetian gondolas and used when they sail on parties of pleasure In these they make a kind of procession two or three times in a week with their streamers flying attended by the small canoes while hundreds of the natives accompany their motions on the shore On these occasions they put on their best cloaths and while some are under a large awning others sit upon itthese are clothed in red and white two men in red sit on the prow of each vessel while the rowers and steersmen are in white  The people of Otaheite use bows and arrows which last are headed with a round stone They have likewise bludgeons and slings for the throwing of stones  The inhabitants being shewn some small turtles hinted that they had some which were much larger but not one was seen by any of the ship's crew  Captain Wallis represents this island as one of the most pleasant in the universe being blessed with a pure air abounding in wood and herbage  harbouring no venomous animal and its inhabitants being happy in a constant flow of health The southeast part of the island which produces fruit in vast abundance is better peopled than the spot near where the ship lay  When captain Cook in the Endeavour visited this island he found the venereal disease among the natives which must have been contracted from some of the crew under the command of M Bougainville for not one of captain Wallis's men were infected with that disorder for several months before and after his arrival at Otaheite  The Dolphin sailed from this harbour on the th of July and passed the Duke of York's Island the coast of which abounds with plantaintrees cocoanut breadfruit and appletrees On the th they discovered land which was called SIR CHARLES SAUNDER'S ISLAND It had a few inhabitants who lived in small huts and the cocoanut and other trees grew on the shore On the th they again made land which received the name of LORD HOWE'S ISLAND on which smoke was seen but no inhabitants Their next discovery was of some dangerous shoals to which captain Wallis gave the name of the SCILLY ISLANDS  They now steered westward till the th of August when they saw two small islands one of which was named KEPPEL'S ISLE and the other BOSCAWEN'S ISLAND on the latter of  which were several inhabitants but they steered for the former as its appearance promised the most convenient anchorage By the help of glasses they now discovered the natives on the shore but they did not attempt to anchor that night on account of some breakers at a considerable distance from the island  The boats being dispatched to the island brought on board some cocoanuts and other fruit and a couple of fowls The officer reported that the inhabitants were not unlike those of Otaheite that some few of them ventured into the boat but soon jumped out and swam back to the island These people were remarkable for having the first joint of their little fingers cut off and they were dressed in a sort of matting  As there was no convenient wateringplace at this island and as the ship had received some damages that had rendered her unfit to encounter a rough sea the Captain determined to sail for Tinian from thence to Batavia and so to England by the Cape of Good Hope He therefore passed the island which is well inhabited abounds in timber and is of a circular form  On the th they again discovered land to which the officers gave the name of WALLIS'S ISLAND The coast of this island is very rocky and the trees grow almost to the edge of the water The inhabitants wore no covering but a mat round the waist each man had a very  large club two of which were purchased by the boat's crew These people attempting to steal the cutter by hauling her upon the rocks a gun was fired close to one of their faces the report of which so terrified them that they decamped with the utmost speed When the boats were returning to the ship they were impeded by the points of rocks which being observed by the Indians they followed in their canoes till they got into deep water and then they rowed back  Captain Wallis remarks as an extraordinary circumstance that although no sort of metal was seen on any of the lately discovered islands yet the natives were no sooner possessed of a piece of iron than they began to sharpen it but did not treat copper or brass in the same manner  They now sailed to the northwest and on the th observed a number of birds flying about the ship one of which they catched It was webfooted but in all other respects resembled a dove On the d of September they saw land which was thought to be two of the Piscadore Islands and on this day an Indian Proa a description of which is given in Anson's Voyage made towards the ship on which they hoisted Spanish Colours but she came no nearer than within about two miles On the th and th they saw several birds one of which was taken and judged to be a landbird On the th they discovered the island of Saypan  and soon afterwards that of Tinian off which they anchored on the day following  No time was lost in sending the boats on shore and they returned in a few hours with oranges limes and cocoanuts Tents were erected for the sick who were sent on shore with all expedition The smith's forge and carpenter's chest were also landed and the Captain and first Lieutenant who both continued ill went on shore with a party of men to hunt for cattle A young bull of great weight was soon catched and they found plenty of oranges limes and breadfruit On the st they began the necessary repairs of the ship The fatigue sustained by those who went to hunt for cattle was so great by going many miles thro' thickets that one party was ordered to relieve another and the second Lieutenant with several of the men being sent to reside on the north part of the island where cattle were most plentiful a boat was sent daily to bring in what they catched In this island they procured beef pork poultry papawapples and all the other refreshments of which an account is given in Anson's Voyage  By the th of October the fruit and water was carried on board and all the sick being recovered preparations were made for sailing and on the next day they left the bay and sailed to the west  On the st and d they saw several gannets and other birds and on the d and two following days it blew a violent storm the effects of which were the more dreaded as the ship admitted more water than she had done at any time during the voyage The bad weather continued on the th when they saw several landbirds They had now to encounter the united horrors of thunder lightning rain darkness and such a violent sea as broke even the iron work on the gunwhale and washed overboard many heavy things On the th they were blest with a sight of the sun and the day following the weather became more temperate In the middle of the night one Morgan a taylor was suddenly missed and it was thought he fell overboard in a fit of intoxication  On the d of November they discovered three islands which were named SANDY ISLE SMALL KEY and LONG ISLAND and on the day following they saw another to which captain Wallis gave the name of NEW ISLAND all of which islands are in ten degrees odd minutes northlatitude and degrees odd minutes westlongitude The ship held her course till the th on which day the log and journalbooks of the voyage were taken from the inferior officers and foremastmen  They now altered their course and on the th saw the islands of Timoun Aros and Pelang On the th they crossed the equinoctial  line and came again into southlatitude The next day they saw the islands of Pulo Toté and Pulo Weste soon after which they had sight of the seven islands A singular incident happened in the succeeding night which was very tempestuous and so dark that they could not see across the ship During the full violence of the wind a flash of lightning afforded them light enough to see a ship of considerable size which was so near that it was with difficulty they steered clear of her but they could not get information to what nation she belonged as the wind was too loud for them to hear each other This was the first ship they had seen since they parted from the Swallow In the morning they saw the Island of Pulo Taya near which they came to an anchor in the evening and the next morning sailed again and saw two ships ahead of them but the current was so strong that they lost ground and therefore they again anchored in the evening The next day they lost an anchor the cable of which was cut away by the rocks On the d they saw the coast of Sumatra and came to an anchor in the road of Batavia on the th of November  On the following day captain Wallis saluted the Dutch governor with guns and the compliment was returned from the fort with one additional gun Permission having been obtained to purchase necessaries they were soon  supplied with beef and vegetables The crew were now threatened with punishment if any attempt should be made to bring liquor aboard and no man was permitted to leave the ship but those who were called by duty and even those were not suffered to go into the townThe intemperate use of arrack is highly pernicious to strangers who visit Batavia  His Majesty's ship the Falmouth was at this time laying in the road but in so shattered a condition that it was thought she could not hold together during the next monsoon nor were the few of her crew which remained alive in any better condition than the vessel On the th of December captain Wallis received a petition from the warrant officers of the Falmouth setting forth that their powder had been thrown into the sea by order of the Dutch and that the gunner was dead that their misfortunes had deprived the boatswain of his senses and that he was then a lunatic in the Dutch hospital that his stores were all spoiled that the cook had been wounded and remained a cripple and that the carpenter was near deathThey therefore petitioned that the Captain would carry them to England or at all adventures dismiss them from the ship as there was now nothing left for them to take charge of Captain Wallis was obliged to refuse their request however reasonable and informed them that as they had taken charge of stores they  must wait for orders from England To this they answered that they had not received a single order since they were left in the road of Batavia that they had ten years pay due and would rather go home sweepers than remain in their present wretched situation That they were never permitted to sleep on shore and when sick no person had the humanity to visit them that the Malays frequently robbed them and that they expected destruction at the hands of those people as they had burnt the Siam Prize not long before the arrival of the Dolphin They entreated the Captain to make their case known in England which he readily promised to do  On the th the Captain went on shore to buy such stores as he thought necessary to carry the ship home with safety He visited the different storehouses and arsenals but the demands of the Dutch were so exorbitant that he determined to make shift with such materials as he had rather than be imposed on by people who wished to take every advantage of his necessity Accordingly he sailed on the th of December without losing a single man and having only two on the sick list  On the th the crew began to be afflicted with colds and fluxes and the following night they saw the Coast of Java on which was placed an amazing number of lights intended as they imagined to entice the fish near the beachThey anchored off Princes Island on the th  and began to take in wood and water at which place they remained till the th during which time they purchased turtle poultry and other refreshments  While they lay here one of the seamen fell from the mainyard into the barge which was alongside the ship and struck down two other men one of whom was bru  sed so much that he died in four days but the other escaped with a broken toe the man who fell had several bones broken and was otherwise shockingly bruised They buried three men here and many others were seized with fluxes and putrid fevers the contagi  n of which last disorder constantly attacked in a day or two those who attended the sick At th  s time too the ship made above three feet water in four hours  They struggled with these accumulated misfortune till the  th of January when the sickness began to abateOn the  th they encountered a dreadful storm wh  h tore the sails to pieces  ke a  and carried several of the beams ever  yet during this storm they observed a  of birds and butterfliesOn the  th they saw land and came to an anchor in Table B  y at the Cape of Good Hope on the th of February  Captain Wallis having saluted the Governor and the Commanders of  in the harbour and they having  salute in retu  n he lost no time  p  uring fresh meat  and vegetables for the use of the crew The surgeon was sent on shore to hire lodgings for the sick but as the rate demanded was very high and as the smallpox which many of the seamen had not had raged prodigiously the Captain obtained the Governor's permission to erect tents on a plain about two miles from the town  This being done the sick were sent on shore positive orders being given that no liquor should be brought to the tents that no one should be permitted to go into the town and that extra provisions should be procured for those who were most reduced by sickness The Captain was so very ill that as long as the ship lay here he was at a countryhouse several miles distant  Every man who was able to do any kind of work was now employed in the necessary repairs of the ship which being nearly compleated by the th of February several of the men who had had the smallpox were permitted to visit the town and those who had not had that distemper were allowed to take daily walks in the country and as they did not abuse this liberty it was continued to them as long as the ship remained there  The necessaries which could not be purchased of the Dutch at Batavia were bought reasonably at this place and fresh water was procured by distillation with a view to convince the  commanders of the Indiamen that lay here how easily wholesome water might be procured at sea This method of distillation is as follows gallons of salt water being put into the still at five in the morning thirtysix gallons of fresh water was obtained by about a quarter after ten thirteen gallons and a half remaining in the still This fresh water was procured at the expence of sixtynine pounds of coals and nine pounds of wood  On the th all hands were ordered on board when it was found that every man except three was able to do duty A number of sheep were purchased for sea stores and the ship sailed on the third of March  On the th they anchored in the bay of St Helena and sent persons on shore to get water and others to gather purslain of which there is great plenty The Captain going on shore was saluted by the guns of the fort and requested to make that place his residence during his stay on the island but their watercasks being soon filled and the wind serving the next day they then sailed for England  On the th they crossed the equinoctial line getting once more into northlatitude On the th they saw the Cape of PicoOn the th of May they had sight of the Savage sloop of war captain Hammond in chace of a sloop at which he fired several guns On this captain Wallis fired and brought the vessel to which  proved to be laden with brandy tea c from Roscoe in France she was of Liverpool and was commanded by Robert Christian Captain Wallis detained her in order to her being sent to England as she was judged to be a smuggler pretending to be bound to Bergen in Norway tho' she was sailing to the southwest  No material incident happened from this time to the end of the voyage which was happily compleated by the Dolphin coming to an anchor in the Downs on the th of May  CAPTAIN CARTERET's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD In and  MR Carteret having already circumnavigated the globe with Commodore Byron was appointed to the command of the Swallow sloop soon after his return to England and on the d of August sailed from Plymouth in company with his Majesty's ship the Dolphin and the Prince Frederick storeship  Nothing material happened till the morning of the th of September when the ship lay in the road of Madeira at which time nine prime seamen left the vessel privately and swam on shore naked having only their money tied in handkerchiefs round their bodies While Captain Carteret was writing to the Consul to assist him in the recovery of these brave but imprudent fellows he received a message that they had been found naked on the shore A boat was instantly dispatched to bring them on board where they cut a most ridiculous figure and seemed heartily ashamed of what they had done it appeared however that they had ran this risk only to get a skinful of liquor as they said knowing they were bound on a long voyage  and it being uncertain who might live or die Captain Carteret endeared himself very much to the crew by pardoning these men whose future services amply repaid this welltimed lenity  It will be needless to recite any particulars which happened till the th of April when the Swallow parted company with the Dolphin and Prince Frederick as already related in the account of Captain Wallis's Voyage At nine o'clock on this day the Swallow had totally lost sight of the Dolphin which Captain Carteret judged to be then clear of the mouth of the Streights and as the Swallow was then under land where she had not the advantage of any considerable breeze they entertained no hope of seeing their consort during the remainder of the voyage  At this time all the cloth linen cutlery wares and trinkets were on board the Dolphin a circumstance which aggravated Captain Carteret's distress as he had not any thing proper to barter with the Indians yet he encouraged the crew not to despair and was happy to find that they were in high spirits for the voyage  A few hours after the ships parted company the Swallow encountered a violent storm during which there was so thick a fog that they could not see mountainous land which they were within half a mile of At this time the boat was out in search of an anchoringplace  and when night came on it was so dark that they could not see half the length of the ship they therefore hoisted lights and fired a gun every half hour and at length the boat reached the ship in safety The next morning the boat was again sent in search of a place to anchor in and in the afternoon when the Captain despaired of her returning in time he saw her sounding a bay and instantly making towards her came to anchor in safety  The Captain now retired to rest but he was disturbed in a few minutes by the shouting of the crew upon the deck and the noise of those below running to join them His fears brought him instantly on the deck where he heard the universal cry of the Dolphin the Dolphin but this flattering appearance soon vanished and proved to be only water forced up and whirled in the air by a gust of wind from the mountains Mr Carteret says that as the current sets continually into the harbour where they lay he has no doubt but it has another communication with the sea to the south of Deseada The borders of the bay abound with muscles and wild geese and afford plenty of wood and water  They sailed from this place early in the morning of the th of April and soon afterwards by the sudden shifting of the wind they encountered so violent a storm that they were in danger of sinking yet they did not dare to take  in any sails for fear of running foul of some rocky islands which in Narborough's Voyage are called the Islands of Direction nor could they go back into the Streight without the danger of running foul of a leeshore yet notwithstanding their best endeavours the ship made hastily towards this lee shore Thus circumstanced they were compelled to stave the watercasks on and between the decks that she might carry better sail and by this expedient they at length escaped the threatened destruction They now got into the open sea after a very providential deliverance for had the wind again shifted the ship must have been unavoidably lost  They now steered a northward course along the Coast of Chili but as the water on board was deemed insufficient for the length of the voyage the Captain proposed touching at the Island of Juan Fernandes or Masafuero to take in a proper quantity On the th the wind which had hitherto been favourable for their sailing northward and consequently getting into a more temperate climate suddenly shifted and continued contrary till the th of April blowing violently all the time accompanied at intervals with dreadful thunder lightning rain and hail  During this time they saw abundance of seabirds among which were two sorts one like a pigeon which the seamen called the Cape of Good Hope Hen and the other Mother Carey's  Chickens but the true name of these latter is the Peterel  From the th of this month till the st of May they had continual storms and on this day a prodigious sea laid the whole ship under water for some time while the wind blew a hurricane and the rain poured down in torrents The wind now shifted so that the head of the vessel came right against a mountainous sea which repeatedly broke over the forecastle as far as the mainmast so that it was almost a miracle that she was not sunk  When the weather became something more moderate they repaired in some degree the damage the ship had sustained during the storm but they had much bad weather afterwards till the th of May when they were in sight of the Island of Masafuero and on the th they saw Juan Fernandes and sailed round to Cumberland Bay on the eastside of it  The Spaniards having fortified this island a circumstance till then unknown to Captain Carteret a number of men were seen on the shore and two large boats lying on the beach A house and four pieces of cannon were observed near the sea side and on the brow of a hill at a small distance was a fort with Spanish colours flying on it Many cattle were seen on the hills and above houses on different parts of the island The wind blew so strong out of the bay that it was impossible to get  very near it they therefore sailed westward and were followed by one of the Spanish boats but she soon returned on observing that the wind kept them out of the harbour On the eastern side of the west bay they saw a kind of guardhouse with two pieces of cannon on carriages near it They now returned towards Cumberland Bay when the boat again put after them but night coming on they lost sight of her As Captain Carteret had only English colours on board he did not hoist any during all this time  Thus disappointed of the refreshments they so very much wanted they sailed for Masafuero where they anchored on the th but were unable to land as the beach was full of rocks and the surf ran so violently that the best swimmers could not get through the breakers the next morning however the boats landed and filled some watercasks  On the th they anchored on the eastside of the island but were driven from their moorings and kept out at sea all night In the morning the cutter was sent for water and the ship got near the shore where she soon received several casks and sent the cutter back for more The longboat was likewise dispatched on this service as well as to carry provisions to those on shore In the afternoon the boats being observed running along the shore the ship followed and took them in but not without their  sustaining so much damage by the violence of the sea that the carpenters were obliged to work all night in repairing them  On the th the cutter was again sent for water and when she returned the Lieutenant reported that the violent rains which had fallen in the night had brought down such a deluge of water that the people on shore narrowly escaped drowning after losing several of the casks Mr Gower the Lieutenant having seen many rivulets of water produced by the rain which had fallen in the night proposed to go and fill the casks but he had not been long gone before the weather began to wear a very threatening appearance and it thundered and lightned to a degree beyond description The ship now kept as near the shore as possible and as it was grown quite dark they were very apprehensive that the longboat was lost but she happily came alongside just in time to prevent the destruction of her whole crew for she had scarce been hoisted over the ship's side a moment before such a violent squall came on as must inevitably have sunk her Mr Gower reported that three of the sailors having swam on shore with the casks just before the storm began he was under a necessity however unwilling of leaving them behind exposed naked as they were to thunder lightning rain and hunger  These men returned to the ship on the evening of the th and gave an account how they had passed the melancholy intervalWhile  daylight continued they hoped for an opportunity of regaining the boat but when the darkness and cold of the night advanced they began to consider how they should abide the inclemency of the weather when necessity suggested an expedient that ingenuity might have sought in vainthey laid alternately each between the two other thus procuring at once the partial comforts of a house and a fire As soon as the day broke they proceeded by the seashore towards the tent but being repeatedly impeded by high points of land they swam round them at such a distance to avoid the rocks that they were scarcely in less danger from the sharks happily however they escaped every danger and were received at the wateringplace with a degree of pleasure that does honour to the humanity of their brother tars part of whose cloths and provisions were instantly appropriated to feed the hungry and clothe the naked When these men returned on board they were indulged with a whole night's rest and the next morning were perfectly well The reader will no doubt be pleased to be informed that these were three of the nine men who swam ashore at Madeira for a skinful of liquor  This day such a quantity of fish was taken by the boat with hooks and lines only as was equal to the consumption of the whole crew On the th the ship which had been some time standing off and on near the shore came again  to an anchor when the longboat being sent out procured in a short time an ample supply of fish During the night and all the following day they had extreme bad weather but as soon as it became moderately calm three seamen were sent on shore to kill seals and make oil of their fat for the use of the lamps  On the d in the morning after a stormy night the boats being sent on shore returned with a number of pintado birds which were obtained from the inhabitants who said that when the wind blew briskly in the night these birds flew into the fire in amazing numbers so that they catched several hundreds the preceding night On the d as much water was got off as the weather would permit of but several casks were lost by the violence of the surf The weather now grew so bad that the Captain was impatient to sail he therefore gave orders for all the people on shore to come on board At this time the ship drove from her moorings dragging the anchor after her till she got into deep water They now lay to under bare poles waiting for the boats while the violence of the wind carried the water higher than the masthead In the evening the longboat with ten of the men were taken on board but there yet remained the cutter with the Lieutenant and eighteen men The weather becoming more moderate about midnight the ship stood in for land and at ten the next morning was  near the shore but the cutter was not to be seen about noon however she was discovered close under land and in three hours time her crew got on board These people endeavoured to come off in the evening but had no sooner left the shore than their cutter was almost filled with water and narrowly escaped sinking at length she regained the shore where she remained all night in the morning it was concluded that the ship had perished in the storm and the crew having taken proper methods to secure the boat proposed to wait till the summer when they hoped she might be able to carry them to the Island of Juan Fernandesbut these thoughts were now lost in the joy of their happy deliverance  The island of Masafuero is of a triangular form about miles in circumference and at a distance has the appearance of a single rock there is good anchorage on many parts of the coast and the island abounds with goats Wood and water are plenty but difficult to be procured on account of the violence of the surf Cod hallibut coalfish and crayfish are to be catched in great numbers and seals are so numerous that Captain Carteret thinks the killing of thousands could make no apparent difference in their numbers The mountain cabbage grows on the island which likewise abounds in birds among which are hawks of a very large size  Captain Carteret having left the Island of Musafuero sailed to the north with the hope of getting the southeast tradewind and having got more to the north than he first proposed he looked out for the Islands of St Ambrose and St Felix which he missed through the erroneous printed accounts of their latitudes and longitudes They likewise searched for the continent which in the charts is called Davis's Land but which Mr Carteret gives many reasons for supposing has no existence  This search was continued till the th of June which is the depth of winter when the weather was dark and cold with sleet rain thunder and lightning The gloom was so constant that they had seldom sunshine enough to make an observation yet were necessitated to carry all the sail possible that they might not perish with hunger before the ship should reach some port where they might procure a supply of necessaries  On the d of July they discovered an island which was well clothed with trees and down the side of which ran a stream of fresh water It appeared to be about five miles in circumference and was called PITCAIRN'S ISLAND from the name of a young gentleman who first saw it  On the th the ship admitted a great quantity of water and was otherwise in a very shattered condition from the rough seas she had encountered  The crew now likewise began to be much afflicted with the scurvy though they were happily well supplied with water an abundance of the rainwater being catched by means of an awning lined with painted canvas  On the th Captain Carteret gave the name of the BISHOP OF OSNABURGH'S ISLAND to a low piece of land discovered this day which was well cloathed with verdure On the th they saw two other small islands on one of which the boat's crew landed and found birds so tame as to be taken without the least difficulty The other island was about miles distance but neither of them afforded either water or vegetables They were called the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S ISLANDS and Captain Carteret supposes them to be the same land which was seen by Quiros  From this period till the d of the month they had alternate storms and calms and on this day judged themselves five thousand four hundred miles from the continent of America yet in all this run they had seen no signs of a southern continent  As the scurvy was now daily encreasing among the seamen and as the weather was bad and the ship in a crazy condition the Captain determined to steer such a course as might most probably tend to the preservation of the vessel and the crew In consequence of this resolution he stood to the northward in the hope of having  the advantage of the tradewind and reaching some island where he might be furnished with the necessary refreshments  On the th they saw great flocks of birds which induced them to think that they were near land but they could not discover any On the d of August great numbers of seabirds were seen and on this day the current was observed to set strongly to the southward though it had hitherto ran in a contrary direction whence the Captain concluded that the passage between New Zealand and New Holland opened in this latitude which was ten degrees eighteen minutes south and the longitude degrees minutes east  On the th of this month the ship sprung a leak in a part which they could not come at to repair so that their situation was truly alarming but two days afterwards they discovered land which gave fresh spirits to the almost desponding crew The Captain observed seven islands and sailed towards two of them which lay very near together in the evening they came to an anchor near the largest of them on which were seen two of the natives who were negroes with woolly heads and wore no kind of clothing  A boat being sent on shore an account was brought back that there was fine fresh water opposite where the ship lay but that it would be diff  cult to procure it as the whole country was covered  with thick wood quite to the sea shore This circumstance added to the danger there might be of the natives attacking them from the woods determined the Captain to look for a more convenient anchoringplaceOn the day following therefore the cutter with the master and a party of seamen was sent to the westward to search for a place to procure wood and water to seek for refreshments for the sick and to discover a place where the ship might be repaired He received orders to be strictly on his guard against any attack from the natives and took with him a few trinkets that happened to be on board to procure their good will The longboat being likewise sent off she soon returned laden with water she was dispatched a second time but the people on board the ship observing some of the natives advancing to the landingplace a signal was made for her to return  Soon after this three of the Indians sat down on the shore looking stedfastly at the ship for several hours The Lieutenant was now sent towards them but when they saw the boat approaching they moved along the coast where they were soon met by three others When they had conferred together the former went on while the latter advanced hastily towards the boat This being observed from the ship a signal was made for the boat's crew to act with caution The Lieutenant now proceeded to the shore and offered his presents to the Indians  who regardless of his trinkets discharged their arrows and immediately ran off though the boat's crew received no injury they fired at the natives but these likewise escaped unhurt  In a short time after this the cutter came on board the Master who commanded her having three arrows sticking in his body The account he gave of his expedition was in substance as follows Being arrived at a place about fifteen miles from the ship he saw some houses but only a very few of the natives and landed with four of the crew well armed the first fears of the Indians being dispelled they accepted his presents with pleasure and in return gave him some fish yams and cocoanuts He then went to the houses but soon observing a number of the natives among the trees and several canoes coming round a point he hastened towards the boat but before he could embark a general attack with bows and arrows was made as well on those in the boat as on those on shore Thus situated the crew fired repeatedly killing and wounding many of the Indians still however the latter continued the fight some of them running into the water as high as the breast and when the boat got f  rther off she was pursued by the canoes which did not retreat till one of them was sunk and many of the people in the others were killed  Some of the crew gave an account of this transaction less favourable to the Master than his own they said that the Indians behaved in the most friendly manner till he exasperated them by cutting down a cocoanut tree after they had strongly intimated their wishes that he would not destroy it The instant the tree fell they all left the spot but one man but they were soon observed to assemble in great numbers among the trees on which a Midshipman entreated the Master to go on board but he slighted the advice nor even retired till the attack was commenced The Master and three of the seamen died of the wounds received from the arrows of the Indians  The Captain now determined to attempt the reparation of the ship in her present situation and succeeced so far that the leak was greatly reduced On the th the wind setting full into the bay the ship was driven near the shore and many of the Indians were observed in the woods as if in expectation of her running aground  On the th a party was sent on shore to get water a shot having been previously fired into the woods to disperse any of the natives that might be lurking in them The Lieutenant was likewise dispatched in the cutter to keep the coast clear for the waterers by repeated firings into the woods yet in spite of these precautions a flight of arrows was soon discharged among  them by which one of the seamen was dangerously wounded The crew now incessantly fired to that part of the wood from whence the arrows came but the Captain made a signal for the boats to come off and as soon as he had taken them on board fired several canon into the woods on which a great number of the natives left their retreat and ran away along the shore  In a short time another large party was observed on a point of the bay at whom a ball being fired it fell in the midst of and dispersed them The people now took in water with safety but a constant firing was kept up both from the ship and from a party on shore and it appeared that our countrymen had been dreadfully successful for repeated groans as of dying men were heard from several places in the woods  As the Master was now dying of the wounds he had received by the arrows as the Captain and Lieutenant were so ill that their recovery was doubtful and as there was no chance of procuring proper refreshments at this place all intentions of pursuing the voyage farther to the southward were laid aside the Captain therefore having named the place EGMONT ISLAND and the harbour where the ship had lain SWALLOW BAY sailed from it on the th of August  On the same day an island was discovered which received the name of PORTLAND'S ISLAND four miles from which they saw an harbour which was called BYRON'S HARBOUR Having sailed three leagues from the harbour they had sight of the bay where the Indians had attacked the crew of the cutter This was called BLOODY BAY on its borders were a number of houses well constructed and one much longer than the others which had the appearance of a kind of hall for the transaction of public business In this place which was well built and covered with a kind of thatch the Master and his party had been received by the natives before the wanton cutting down of the cocoanut tree A large number of arrows were hung in bundles round the room the floor and sides of which were covered with matting In this neighbourhood were many gardens surrounded by stone walls and planted with vegetables Three miles from this village a large town was seen in the front of which towards the sea was an angular kind of fortification built of stone and near five feet high  About three miles from hence they saw a bay into which a river empties itself which they called GRANVILLE'S RIVER and it appeared to be navigable for small vessels far up the country The point of this bay was called FERRERS'S POINT and from hence the land forms a large bay near which is a considerable town  inhabited by an incredible number of people who while the ship was sailing by came out of their houses holding something like a bundle of grass in their hands with which they appeared to stroke each other running in rings or dancing all the while  Sailing onwards a few miles they saw another point which was called CARTERET POINT on which was a large canoe with an awning over it at a small distance was another town fortified as that beforementioned The inhabitants of this place likewise advanced before their houses and danced as the others had done The dance being ended many of them came off in canoes towards the ship but having got near enough to have a good view of her they would advance no farther  They soon saw another small island which was named TREVANION'S ISLAND and the north part of it was called CAPE TREVANION Both the main land and this island abounded with inhabitants and a boat being sent to sound the passage they no sooner observed that she had left the ship than several canoes advanced to attack her The Indians having let fly their arrows the boat's crew fired and killed one man and wounded another A gun laden with grape shot was at the same time fired from the ship on which all the canoes pulled hard for the shore except the one with the wounded man in it which being taken to the ship the surgeon  was ordered to examine his wounds One of this poor fellow's arms was broke and a shot had gone through his head and the Surgeon being of opinion that the latter wound was mortal he was placed in his canoe again and with one hand rowed towards the shore His canoe was formed only of the hollow trunk of a tree he was a young fellow almost as black as the negroes of Guinea his features were good his hair woolly and he went quite nakedIt may be fairly asked here if it would not have been an act of humanity to have attempted the cure of this unfortunate youth if it had been only by a single dressing before he had been dismissed  As they sailed along the shore they saw plantains bananas and cocoanut trees and observed great numbers of hogs and poultry but the Captain being yet very ill and having not officers sufficient to direct the men in the common business of the ship he had no opportunity of establishing a friendly traffick with the Indians and was unable to obtain by force those refreshments which the crew became every hour more and more in want of  Thus situated unable to proceed farther to the south and in danger of being too late for the monsoon he gave immediate orders to proceed northwards in hope of discovering the country which Dampier has distinguished by the name of  Nova Britannia    To all the islands they had now left Captain Carteret gave the general name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLANDS and besides those already mentioned he saw several which he named as follows viz LORD HOW'S ISLAND KEPPEL'S ISLAND LORD EDGCOMBE'S ISLAND OURRY'S ISLAND and VOLCANO ISLAND this last being so denominated from a smoke that issued from its top which is of an amazing height and shaped like a sugar loaf  The canoes of the inhabitants are formed of the trunk of a tree hollowed are large enough to contain ten or twelve people and are furnished with outriggers but have no sails  The people of Egmont Island are very expert at swimming and diving and active and vigorous in a high degree Their arrows are so sharp and discharged with such strength that one of them wounded a man in the thigh after passing through the washboard of the boat The points of these arrows are flint and no metal was seen among the natives There are good harbours on the coasts of these islands which likewise abound in rivers and have some vallies but for the most part they are mountainous and covered with trees  Captain Carteret sailed on the th of August and holding a westnorthwest course he on the th discovered a small island which was called GOWER'S ISLAND the people of which did not differ in any thing material from  those of the islands he had lately left Some cocoanuts were here procured in exchange for nails and the inhabitants had intimated that they would furnish a farther supply the next morning but it was then found that the current had carried the ship considerably to the south during the night and brought them within sight of two other islands one of which was called SIMPSON'S ISLAND and the other CARTERET'S ISLAND  As both these islands were to windward of the ship they sailed again to Gower's Island which abounds with fine trees many of which are the cocoanut A boat being sent on shore the Indians attempted to seize her and in return the crew made prize of a canoe in which was a number of cocoanuts The arms of the natives were spears bows and arrows  As a strong current set to the southward they now steered a northwesterly course because the bad condition of the ship and sickness of the crew would have rendered it impossible for them ever to have got to sea again if they had been driven into any gulph or deep bay On the d one of the marines sell overboard and was drowned notwithstanding every effort was used to save him  The ship fell in with nine islands in the night of the th which Captain Carteret supposes to be the same that were discovered by Tasman and are named Ohang Java eight of  these are very small but the other is more extensive and they are all inhabited by blacks whose heads are woolly like those on the coast of Africa The next day they had sight of an island covered with verdure which was called SIR CHARLES HARDY'S ISLAND and from the number of fires that were seen on it they supposed it to be inhabited This day they likewise had sight of a large island formed of three high hills which took the name of WINCHELSEA'S ISLAND On the th they saw a large island to the north which Captain Carteret imagines to have been the island of St John that was discovered by Schouten  This day they were within sight of Nova Britannia and the next morning the current drove the ship into a deep bay which in Dampier's Voyages is called St George's Bay On the th they gave the name of WALLIS'S ISLAND to a small island in a bay off which they came to an anchor and were now miles due west from the main land of America The cutter was sent out to catch fish but not succeeding she returned with a considerable number of cocoanuts  On the next day after great fatigue they weighed the anchor and sailed to a place which they called ENGLISH COVE where they immediately began to take in wood and water They now attempted to catch fish with hooks and lines but none of them would bite nor were  they much more successful with their nets turtle likewise were very plentiful yet they could not take any of them but at low water they picked up some large cockles and rock oysters From the shore they procured cocoanuts and the cabbage of the cocoatree which is crisp and juicy this when eaten raw tastes like a chesnut but when boiled has a more agreeable flavour than the parsnip It was found to be excellent when boiled with portable soup and oatmeal They likewise gathered some plumbs which tasted like those of the West Indies which are called Jamaica plumbs and by this supply of vegetables they had soon reason to rejoice in the blessing of returning health  This island seemed to have been lately inhabited as several wretched huts were seen in which were the remains of fires and the shells of fish which did not appear to have been long catched they had likewise a sight of two animals which were supposed to be dogs This place produces palmtrees of various kinds aloes canes bamboos rattans beetlenut and the nutmegtree with a variety of other trees and many shrubs and plants of which the names were not known In the woods was a large blackbird whose note was not unlike the barking of a dog there were likewise parrots rooks pigeons and doves they also saw centipieds serpents and scorpions  Having taken in wood and water and repaired the ship in the best manner they were able the Captain took possession of the country with all the neighbouring islands for the King of Great Britain This was done by nailing on a lofty tree a piece of board faced with lead on which was engraved the name of the vessel and of the Captain the time of entering and leaving the harbour and a representation of the union flag of England  They left this cove on the th of September and anchored on the same day almost close to a grove of cocoanut trees where they supplied themselves with the fruit and the cabbage in very great abundance and called the place CARTERET'S HARBOUR which being formed by the main and two islands one of them was named LEIGH'S ISLAND and the other COCOANUT ISLAND  Nothing now remained but to attempt the reaching Batavia while the monsoon continued favourable on the th of September therefore the anchor was weighed and when they were about four leagues from land the wind and current being both against them they steered round the coast into a channel between two Islands which channel was divided by another island to which Captain Carteret gave the name of the DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND and near which are several smaller islands To the south of the largest island are three hills of singular  form which were called the MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS one of which was supposed to be a volcano from the large clouds of smoke that were seen issuing from it A point they called CAPE PALLISER lies to the east of these hills and CAPE STEPHENS to the west north of which last lies an island which took the name of the ISLE OF MAN The country in general is mountainous and woody and was supposed to be inhabited from the number of fires seen on it in the night On the Duke of York's Island the houses are situated among groves of the cocoanut tree and form the most enchanting prospect  Having brought to for the night they sailed again in the morning when some of the Indians put off in canoes towards the ship but the wind being fair and blowing fresh it was not thought prudent to wait for them Steering northwest by west they lost sight of New Britain on the th and it being now found that what had been taken for a bay was a streight it was called ST GEORGE'S CHANNEL and the island on the north of it received the name of NEW IRELAND In the evening they discovered a large island well clothed with vendure which was denominated SANDWICH ISLAND off this island the ship lay great part of the night during which time a perpetual noise was heard resembling the sound of a drum When they had almost cleared the Streight the weather falling calm  a number of canoes approached the ship and though they could not be prevailed on to go on board they exchanged some little matters with the crew receiving nails and bits of iron which they preferred to every thing else that was offered them Though the canoes of these people were formed out of single trees they were between and feet in length The natives are negroes and their hair is of the woolly kind but they have neither thick lips nor flat noses They wore shellwork on their legs and arms but were otherwise naked except that their hair and beards were powdered with white powder and a feather was stuck into the head above the ear Their arms consisted of a long stick and a spear and it was observed that they had fishingnets and cordage  They now sailed west and coming in sight of the southwest point of the island it was called CAPE BYRON near which is an island of considerable extent which received the name of NEW HANOVER The Streight they had now passed was called BYRON'S STREIGHT one of the largest islands they had seen BYRON'S ISLAND and the southwest point of New Hanover QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S FORELAND On the following day they saw several small islands which received the name of the DUKE OF PORTLAND'S ISLANDS  When they had compleatly navigated St George's Channel the whole length of which  is about one hundred leagues they sailed a westward course and on the th of September discovered several islands The next morning some hundreds of the natives came off in canoes towards the ship and were invited on board by every token of friendship and good will notwithstanding which when they came within reach they threw several lances at the seamen on the deck A great gun and several muskets were now fired at them by which some were killed or wounded on which they rowed towards the shore and after they had got to a distance a shot was fired so as to fall beyond them to convince them that they were not out of the reach of the guns  In a short time other canoes advanced hastily from a distant part of the island and one of them coming nearer than the rest the people in it were invited on board the ship but instead of complying with the invitation they threw in a number of darts and lances This assault was returned by the firing of several muskets whereby one of the Indians was killed on which his companions jumped overboard and swam to the other canoes all of which rowed to the shore This canoe being taken on board was found to contain a turtle some other fish and a fruit between the apple and plumb of a species hitherto unknown to Europeans These people were almost negroes with woolly hair which they powdered and  they went naked except the ornaments of shells round their arms and legs  Captain Carteret now coasted along the islands to which he gave the general name of the ADMIRALTY ISLANDS He describes them as having a most enchanting appearance being covered with woods groves of cocoanut trees and the houses of the natives The largest of these islands is computed to be above miles in length and he supposes that they produce many valuable articles particularly spices  They discovered two small verdant islands on the th which were called DUROUR'S ISLAND and MATTY'S ISLAND the inhabitants of which last ran along the coast with lights during the night They had sight of two other small islands on the th which were called STEPHENS'S ISLANDS and which abounded with beautiful trees  On the evening of the th they had sight of three islands the natives of which came off in canoes and went on board the ship They bartered cocoanuts for some bits of iron with which metal they did not seem unacquainted and appeared extravagantly fond of it They called it  parram  and intimated that a ship sometimes touched at their islands Those people were of the copper colour and had fine black hair but their beards were very small as they were continually plucking the hair from their faces Their teeth were even and white  and their countenances agreeable their activity was such that they ran to the masthead even quicker than the seamen They ate and drank any thing that was given them and had not the least degree of reserve in their behaviour Their dress consisted only of a piece of fine matting round the waistAs the current carried the ship at a great rate the Captain had no opportunity of landing though the Indians offered that some of their people should remain on board as a security for the safe return of such of the seamen as might be sent on shore One of the Indians on finding that none of the crew were to land absolutely refused to leave the ship and was therefore carried to the island of Celebes where he died This man was named Joseph Freewill and the largest of the islands was called FREEWILL ISLAND but the natives called it Pegan and the names of the other two are Onata and Onello  On the evening of the th they discovered an island from the masthead but they neither visited nor gave name to it On the th of October they got sight of a small island which was named CURRENT ISLAND from the great strength of the southerly current and on the following day they discovered two more small islands which were called ST ANDREW'S ISLANDS  On the th they had sight of land which on the day following they knew to be the Island of Mindanao and coasted the southeast  part of it in search of a bay described in Dampier's Voyages but they could not find it A boat being sent out found a little nook at the southern extremity of the island near which was a town and a fort The boat being seen from the shore a gun was fired and some canoes came out after it on which the Lieutenant retreated towards the ship and when the canoes came in sight of her they retired in their turn  They now sailed eastward and on the d of November anchored in a bay near the shore whither the boats immediately went and took in water they saw no signs of that part of the island being inhabited but a canoe being observed to come round a point of the bay as if to watch their motions the Captain hoisted English colours in the hope of tempting her crew on board but they only took a survey of the ship and rowed off  In the night a loud noise was heard from the shore very much like the warwhoop of the savages of America which inducing Captain Carteret to think that the intentions of the islanders were hostile he ordered up his guns from the hold and made all preparations to repress force with force The next morning one of the boats was sent on shore for water while the other was held in readiness to assist in case of danger As soon as the crew had landed many armed men advanced from the woods  one of whom holding up something white the Captain who had no white flag on board sent the Lieutenant on shore with orders to display a tablecloth as a signal of peace This being done two Indians came down to the Lieutenant one of whom addressed him first in Dutch and then in Spanish in which latter tongue he was with difficulty understood His enquiries were if the ship was a Dutch vessel what number of men and guns she carried if she had been to Batavia or was bound thither and whether she was designed for war or trade  These questions being answered he said they might go to the town and he would introduce them to the Governor The Lieutenant now desired that some armed Indians might retreat and that the seamen might be permitted to fill water which was readily granted This being done the Lieutenant presented the Indian with a silk handkerchief and received a coarse neckcloth in return The boats soon returned to the ship with a good supply of water and Captain Carteret was congratulating himself on the prospect which these amicable appearances promised when he observed some hundreds of Indians armed with targets hangers broadswords pikes bows arrows and muskets range themselves opposite the shipthey brandished their swords and held up their targets in token of defiance at the same time discharging their lances and arrows towards the ship  Captain Carteret still resolved to avoid coming to extremities if it were possible and sent the Lieutenant again on shore to display the tablecloth as an ensign of peace The natives seeing that the boat had reached the shore yet that no person landed one of them advanced and beckoned them to come to the spot near where he stood which the Lieutenant declined doing as he would then have been within reach of their arrows  The Captain having formed a resolution of visiting the town sailed from hence the next morning after having called the place DECEITFUL BAY but the wind soon blowing violently in shore he altered his resolution and steered for Batavia  The south of Mindanao is a fine country interspersed with woods lawns and plantations and abounds with inhabitants as do likewise its neighbouring islands Captain Carteret was of opinion that there were Dutchmen in the town or persons in the Dutch interest who finding the Swallow to be an English vessel had irritated the inhabitants against the crew  On the th of November they reached the Streight of Macassar situate between the islands of Borneo and Celebes to a point of which latter island they gave the name of HUMMOCK POINT to the westward of which a number of boats were seen fishing on the  shoals They were in sight of two very small islands on the st which are well clothed with verdure and deemed by Captain Carteret to be the same that are called Taba Islands in the French charts  On the th they crossed the equinoctial line and got into southern latitude at which time they found the current setting against them and the tornadoes became violent The crew was now diminishing by death and weakened daily by sickness so that there were hardly hands sufficient to navigate the vessel On the d of December they had sight of the islands called the Little Paternosters which lie something more than two degrees south of the line but it was out of their power to land any where for refreshment as the winds and currents were against them Not a man on board was now free from the scurvy and when it was imagined that nothing could have aggravated their distress they were attacked by a pirate in the middle of the night of the th of December It was so very dark that they could not see their enemy who attacked them with swivel guns and small arms but they returned the salute so warmly that the pirate was sunk and all her crew perished after having wounded two persons on board the Swallow and done some very trifling damage to the ship The pirate had been seen in the dusk of the evening and Captain Carteret afterwards heard that she belonged  to a Freebooter who had upwards of thirty vessels engaged in the dangerous business of piracy  By the th of this month they had lost thirteen of the crew and the death of thirty others was hourly dreaded At this time too the westerly monsoon was set in so that it was impossible to reach Batavia and as they must speedily make some land or inevitably perish it was resolved to attempt the getting to Macassar a Dutch settlement on the island of Celebes On the th they saw several trees floating and birds sitting on them and two days afterwards they came to an anchor at little more than a league from Macassar  Late that night the Governor sent a Dutchman on board the Swallow who was greatly alarmed to find that she was an English man of war no such vessel having ever anchored there before and so apprehensive of danger was the Dutchman that he would not venture to enter the cabin Very early the next day the Captain sent a letter to the Governor requesting permission to buy provisions and asking shelter for the ship till the proper season returned for sailing to the westward When the boat arrived at the wharf not one of her crew was permitted to land and on the Lieutenant's refusing to deliver the letter except to the Governor himself the Shebander and the Fiscal two officers of the town came to him and said that the Governor was sick and that they came for  the letter by his command Though this sickness was believed to be mere pretence the Lieutenant at length delivered the letter which they took with them When the boat's crew had waited several hours in the burning heat of the sun and without the least refreshment the Lieutenant was informed that the Governor had given orders to two gentlemen to wait on Captain Carteret with an answer to his letter While the boat lay off the wharf it was observed that there was a great hurry on shore all hands being engaged in fitting out such vessels as were proper for war  Soon after the boat came back Mess Le Cerf and Douglas brought a letter intimating that  "the ship should instantly depart from the port without coming any nearer to the town that she should not anchor on any part of the coast and that the Captain should not permit any of his people to land on any place that was under the Governor's jurisdiction"  As the most forcible answer to this letter the Captain shewed his dying men to the gentlemen and again pleaded the urgent necessity of the case They could not but see and feel the propriety of granting refreshments and shelter to persons in such a situation but still they said their orders were absolute and must be obeyed Provoked at this treatment the Captain declared he would anchor close to the town and if they then refused him necessaries that  he would run the ship aground and himself and his crew would sell their lives as dearly as possible Alarmed at this declaration they begged the Captain to remain in his present station till the Governor should give further orders and this he promised provided that he had an answer before the sea breeze set in on the day following  Early in the morning a sloop of war and another vessel with many soldiers on board came and anchored under the ship's bows The Captain sent to speak with them but they would not answer a single question and as the seabreeze set in at noon he then sailed towards the town the other vessels weighing anchor and keeping even pace with him  A vessel now approached from the town in which were several gentlemen among whom was the Mr Douglas abovementioned but none of them would go on board till the Swallow had dropped her anchor On their expressing some surprize that the Swallow had sailed from her former station Captain Carteret told them that he had only acted agreeable to his declaration to them the preceding day in which he was fully justified by his present situation These gentlemen brought with them two sheep some fowls fruit and other provisions which were highly acceptable  After they had made several propositions which Captain Carteret could not but reject  he again declared his resolution of putting his threats in execution and to convince them that he was in earnest shewed them the body of a man who had expired within a few hours but who would probably have been then alive if the refreshments had been brought in time They now enquired if the ship had touched at the Spice Islands and being answered in the negative it was at length agreed that she should sail to a bay at a small distance where an hospital might be built for the sick and where provisions were plenty and that if any thing farther was wanted it should be sent from Macassar  This proposal was readily embraced on the condition that the Governor and Council should ratify it which they afterwards did The Captain now enquiring why the two vessels had anchored under the ship's bows was told that it was only to protect her from any outrages on the part of the natives of the country Mr Carteret had nothing to treat his guests with but bad salt meat and rotten bread but during their treaty a very elegant dinner having been dressed in the gentlemen's vessel it was served up on board the ship after which they parted good friends  An officer from the town coming on board the next day the Captain applied to him to procure money for his bills on the English government This he promised to attempt and went on shore for that purpose but returning in the evening  brought word that there was not a person in the town who wanted to remit any money to Europe and that the Company's chest was totally drained but this difficulty was at length surmounted by an order to the Resident at Bonthain who had money to remit to Europe to take the Captain's bills for any thing he should want  On the day following Mons Le Cerf who was an Ensign brought a pilot on board to carry the ship round to Bonthain and Le Cerf had the command of some soldiers who were on board two guardboats that attended the ship and he was likewise to act as a check on the Resident  All things being thus settled they sailed early on the th of December and anchored in the road of Bonthain on the following day The guardboats were now moored close to the shore to prevent all communication between the ship's boats and those of the country Captain Carteret having attended the Resident to settle the price and mode of procuring provisions a house was appropriated to his use situated near a small fort This being fitted up as an hospital the sick were landed and placed under a guard which was commanded by M Le Cerf who would not permit them to go above thirty yards from the hospital nor the natives to traffic with the seamen so that the profits of traffic fell into the hands of the Dutch soldiers whose gains were immoderate so great  indeed that some of them sold at a profit of more than a thousand per cent after having extorted the provisions from the natives at what price they pleased Captain Carteret having remonstrated with the Resident on the injustice of this procedure he spoke to the soldiers on the subject but this produced no good effect and it was known that after this Le Cerf's wife sold provisions at more than double the prime cost while it was suspected that he sold arrack to the seamen  On the th and th three vessels arrived one of which had troops on board destined for the Banda Islands but their boats not being allowed to go on board the ship the Captain prevailed on the Resident to purchase for his use four casks of salt provisions Above one hundred sail of proas arrived at Bonthain Bay on the thThese vessels which fish round the island carry Dutch colours and send the produce of their labours to China for sale  On the th of January a letter from Macassar informed Captain Carteret that the Dolphin his old consort had arrived at Batavia Ten days after this the Secretary who had been sent with Le Cerf had orders to return to Macassar on the th of February Le Cerf himself was recalled and on the th of March the largest of the guardboats was likewise ordered back On the th the Resident received a letter from the Governor of Macassar enquiring  when Captain Carteret would sail for Batavia though he must know it could not be before the eastern monsoon set in which would not be till May All these were suspicious circumstances and toward the end of the month it was observed that a canoe frequently paddled round the ship several times in the night and retired as soon as she was seen  While every one was speculating on these matters the Captain received a letter informing him that a design was formed for his destruction that the Dutch were at the bottom of this affair but that the ostensible person was to be the son of the King of Bony who was on terms of friendship with the Dutch as they had often assisted him in attempts to reduce the inhabitants of the other parts of the island of Celebes and had been as often repulsed The pretended grounds for this proceeding were that the English might form connections with these unsubdued natives of the island  Whether the information contained in this letter was true or false Captain Carteret put his ship in the best posture of defence possible He even suspected that the Resident was privy to the horrid scheme but he had afterwards reason to be convinced to the contrary though it appeared that one of the Princes subject to the King of Bony and a minister of that monarch had been privately at Bonthain but of  eight hundred men who were said to be there no traces could be found  On the th of May the Captain received through the hands of the Resident a letter from the Governor of Macassar denying his having any knowledge of the abovementioned project and requiring that the writer of the letter might be given up but this requisition was not complied with as the Captain knew he would be equally punished whether his information was or was not true  At this place they purchased plenty of fresh provisions at moderate prices and among the rest beef of an excellent quality The bullocks of this place are those that have the bunch on the back and it likewise abounds in buffaloes horses sheep deer and goats The natives neither eat pork nor turtle but they sold the latter as well as other fish to Captain Carteret  Having taken in wood and water they sailed hence on the d of May and steering along the shore came to an anchor the same evening between the islands of Celebes and Tonikaky They sailed again in the morning and at night saw the southernmost of the islands of Salombo On the th they saw the island of Luback and on the th a number of small islands called CarimonJava  On the d of June they had sight of the land of Java and on the following day came to an anchor in the road of Batavia after having  with difficulty prevented the ship from sinking by the constant working of the pumps during her whole passage from Celebes Having fired guns of salutation the Captain attended the Governor requesting permission to repair the defects of the ship but he was directed to petition the Council  The Council met on the Monday following when the Captain sent a letter stating the defects of the ship and requesting permission to repair her The time from this day till the th of the month was lost in altercations respecting the affair at Bonthain Bay the Governor and Council insisting that Captain Carteret should sign a formal declaration that he believed the report of an intention formed at Celebes for cutting off the ship was false and malicious and the Captain on his part resolutely persisting in his refusal to sign any such paper  On the th the Captain learnt that orders had been given for repairing the ship at Onrust whither a pilot attended her and where she came to an anchor on the d of June but as the wharfs were preengaged by other ships the repairs did not commence till the th of July On examination the vessel was found in so very rotten and decayed a condition that the Dutch carpenter would not undertake her repair without shifting her whole bottom till the Captain had certified under his hand that what should be done was in consequence of his own  express direction This the Dutchman thought necessary lest the ship should never reach England and the blame consequently rest with him  During Captain Carteret's stay at this port he frequently visited M Houting an Admiral in the service of the Dutch a gentleman remarkable for his politeness and affability from whom the Captain received several distinguishing marks of kindnessThe Governor of Batavia lives with the state of a sovereign Prince When he goes publicly abroad he is escorted by horseguards and has two black footmen who run before his coach When any other coach meets that of the Governor it is drawn on one side and the persons in it get out to pay their respects nor if a coach is behind must it be driven by the Governor's whatever necessity may require its greater speed The like homage is paid to the members of the Council only that the person does not quit his carriage but salutes them standing in it one black man with a stick in his hand runs before the coach of a member of the Council and thinks himself at liberty to punish those who do not make a proper obedience  It was hinted to Captain Carteret by the landlord of the hotel where he lodged that his carriage must stop if he should meet the Governor's or those of the Council but the Captain disdaining to pay a degree of homage to  the servants of the States of Holland which is not paid to the King of Great Britain refused to comply and when the black men were mentioned he said he knew how to defend himself and pointed to his pistols In a few hours afterwards he was told from the Governor that he might act as he pleased  Captain Carteret having engaged some English seamen sailed from Onrust on the th of September and came to an anchor off Princes Island in the Streight of Sunda on the following day Having here taken in wood and water they sailed on the th with a fine gale of wind which held them during a passage of leagues and on the d of November they came to an anchor in Table Bay in the Cape of Good Hope The Captain having received numberless civilities from the Governor and other gentlemen of this place sailed on the th of January and on the th anchored off the Island of St Helena from whence he again sailed on the th On the st of January they anchored in a bay off the Island of Ascension where they found an abundance of turtle many of which were taken and the ship sailed again on the following day  It had been accustomed to leave on this island which is uninhabited a letter in a bottle containing an account of the name and destination of any ship which might touch there and with this custom Captain Carteret complied  On the th of this month a ship which had been seen the preceding day far to the leeward but had outsailed the Swallow in the night tacked and stood towards her A boat was sent on board in which was a young officer who by many artful questions endeavoured to learn from Captain Carteret all the most important particulars of his voyage and this piece of ill manners was aggravated by his inventing a tale to disguise those of his own voyage for the vessel he had just left was no other than that of M Bougainville which was then returning from a voyage round the world Captain Carteret learnt this circumstance afterwards from the Lieutenant for the boat's crew which had brought the French officer on board had discovered every secret to one of the English crew who spoke French Happily Captain Carteret had kept his own secret so well that Monsieur Bougainville was not at all the wiser for the time he had lost in the negotiation of this illiberal business The Frenchman learnt the name of the English ship from the letter left in the bottle at the island of Ascension  Our adventurers had sight of the western islands on the th of March and came to an anchor at Spithead on the th of the same month without meeting with any accident worth recording  Considering the extreme unfitness of the Swallow to perform such a voyage the length  of time she was in doing it the amazing dangers she escaped and the apparently insurmountable difficulties she went through to what can we ascribe her arriving safe in England at last but the merciful interposition of a particular providence  CAPTAIN COOK's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD In and  MR Banks a gentleman of considerable fortune in Lincolnshire was induced to undertake this voyage from his natural curiosity and invincible desire of attaining knowledge He had already visited the banks of Newfoundland and Labradore and was now happy in having an opportunity of observing the transit of Venus in the southern part of America He accordingly engaged his friend Dr Solander to accompany him in this voyage This gentleman who was born in Sweden and educated under the celebrated Linnaeus had from his extensive learning been appointed to a place in the British Museum and given the greatest satisfaction in that capacity Mr Banks also took with him two draftsmen one to delineate views and figures the other to paint such subjects of natural history as might present themselves He had besides a secretary and four servants  On the th of August the Endeavour sailed from Plymouth and on the d of September they saw land between Cape Finister and Cape Ortegal on the coast of Gallicia in Spain Mr Banks and Dr Solander had during this course an opportunity of viewing many marine animals hitherto unnoticed among these was a new species of an angular figure near three inches in length and one in thickness having a hollow quite through it and a brown spot at one end Four of these animals were joined together but upon being put into water they separated and swam about They resembled a gem in brightness and shone in the water with fine colours There was another animal of a more beautiful and lively colour which was not unlike an opal About ten leagues from Cape Finister various birds were observed which had not been described by Linnaeus  The islands of Puerto Santo and Madeira were discovered on the th and the next day they anchored in Fonchial road In heaving the anchor Mr Weir the Master's mate was carried overboard and drowned Mr Banks found at Madeira a tree called by the natives  Vigniatico  the  Laura indicus  mentioned by Linnaeus The wood of this tree can scarce be distinguished from mahogany which induced this gentleman to believe that the wood  called in England Madeira mahogany was the  Laura indicus  as no mahogany is exported from this island The only article of trade in Madeira is wine which is made in the following manner the grapes are put into a square wooden vessel the size of which is proportioned to the quantity then the persons employed take off their cloaths get into the vessel and with their elbows and feet press out as much of the juice as they can in this manner the stalks are then tied together and pressed under another square piece of wood by a lever and a stone to extract the remainder of the juice A whole vintage is frequently spoiled by the bad grapes being mixed with the others which the inhabitants obstinately refuse throwing out as the quantity of wine is increased by them  There are no wheelcarriages in this island the only resemblance of them is a hollow board that may be called a sledge and which serves to carry their wine vessels The soil is so rich and there is such a variety in the climate between the hills and plains that there is no object of luxury which grows either in India or Europe that might not probably be cultivated here Walnuts chesnuts and apples flourish almost without culture upon the hills The pineapple the mango the guava and the banana grow almost spontaneously in the town The corn is large grained and fine and it might be produced in great abundance nevertheless  the greatest part of what is consumed is imported The beef mutton and pork are likewise remarkably good particularly the first which induced the Captain to take some on board  Foncho  which is fennel in Portuguese gave name to the town of Fonchial that lies in latitude degrees minutes north and longitude degrees minutes west It is seated at the bottom of a bay poorly built though extensive in proportion to the island the streets are narrow and very badly paved In the churches there are great numbers of ornaments with pictures and images of saints the first are for the most part done by mere daubers and the latter are cloathed in laced habits A better taste prevails in some of the convents particularly that of the Franciscans here simplicity and neatness unite and give us a very favourable idea of these good fathers The infirmary is also a building that does honour to the architect and is the most considerable edifice in the whole place There are many very high hills Pico Ruivo is near feet in height perpendicularly from its base These hills are covered round with vines to a certain height above which there are great numbers of chesnut and pine trees and above them various sorts of timber so thick as to form forests The  Mirmulano  and  Paobranco  which are found amongst them are unknown in Europe The latter is very beautiful and would  be greatly ornamental in our gardens The inhabitants are computed to be between and and the revenue arising from the customs is supposed to amount to or pound sterling per annum Water wine fruit and onions are here in plenty sweatmeats are also to be had without any difficulty but permission must be obtained from the Governor for poultry and fresh meat The Endeavour sailed from Madeira September On the d they saw the Islands of Salvages northward of the Canaries The chief of these islands was about leagues to the south one half west These islands appear to lie in latitude degrees minutes north On the d they saw the Peak of Teneriffe bearing west by south This mountain is near feet high On the th they saw Bona Vista one of the Cape de Verd Islands lying in latitude degrees north and longitude degrees minutes west From Teneriffe to Bona Vista they observed flying fish in great numbers which appeared very beautiful their sides resembling burnished silver Mr Banks went out in a boat on the th of October and caught what is called a Portuguese man of war together with several marine animals of the  Molusca  tribe They had now variable winds with some showers of rain and the dampness of the air did great injury to their iron utensils October  th Mr Banks shot the blacktoed gull which has not been described by Linnaeus The dung of this bird is of a lively red  They crossed the line with the usual ceremonies on the th of October  When the Endeavour was on the th of October in the latitude of Ferdinand Noronha and in longitude degrees minutes west they looked out for the island and the shoals which according to the charts lie between it and the main but neither the island or the shoals could be discovered On the th in the evening they saw the luminous appearance of the sea mentioned by navigators it emitted rays of light resembling those of lightning Mr Banks and Dr Solander not being inclined to adopt any of the opinions that had prevailed with regard to the causes of this luminous appearance such as its being caused by fish darting at its prey by the putrefaction of fish and other inhabitants of the sea and even by electricity threw out a castingnet when they were confirmed in their suggestion that it was occasioned by some luminous animal A species of the  medusa  was caught which resembled a metallic substance greatly heated emitting a whitish light Some crabs were brought up at the same time which though exceeding small gave a very glittering appearance These animals had hitherto escaped the observation of all naturalists  Provisions beginning to fall short it was determined to put into Rio de Janeiro They saw the coast of Brazil on the th of November and spoke with the people on board a Portuguese fishingboat who informed them that the land which they saw was to the south of  Sancto Espirito  Mr Banks bought some fish of the people in the boat and was much surprised to find that they refused Spanish silver and wanted English shillings  Their interpreters who were a Venetian and Portuguese informed them that the crew of the fishing vessel declared they had not seen a ship for eight years this however they supposed to be a mistake as they spoke such imperfect English that it was almost impossible to understand them  On the th in the morning we made sail for the harbour of Rio de Janeiro Mr Hicks the first Lieutenant was sent before in the pinnace to the city to inform the Governor we put in there for refreshments and water and to obtain a pilot The pinnance returned without the Lieutenant who was detained by the Viceroy till the Captain came on shore When the Endeavour came to an anchor a tenoared boat filled with soldiers came up and rowed round the ship without any conversation taking place Soon after another boat came up with several of the Viceroy's officers they enquired  whence the Endeavour came what her cargo consisted of her number of men and guns and her destination These and several other questions were justly answered without equivocation when they apologized for detaining the Lieutenant and the other steps they had taken pleading its being customary  Captain Cook went on shore on the th and obtained leave to purchase provisions on condition of employing an inhabitant as a factor to this the Captain objected but in vain as well as to the sending a soldier in the boat every time she went from the shore to the ship Having requested that the gentlemen on board might remain on shore whilst they sojourned and that Mr Banks might go up the country to collect plants these requests were peremptorily refused Captain Cook judging the Viceroy imagined they were come to trade the Captain endeavoured to convince him of his mistake by acquainting him that they were bound to the southward to observe the transit of Venus over the sun a very interesting object to the advancement of navigation of which phenomenon he appeared to be totally ignorant An officer was appointed to attend the Captain this which he was told was meant as a compliment he would have declined but the Viceroy was too polite to allow his dispensing with the honour  Mr Banks and Dr Solander were greatly disappointed upon the Captain's return to find they were not permitted to reside on shore and go up the country and their chagrin was still farther increased to hear they were not allowed even to leave the ship the Viceroy having ordered that only the Captain and such sailors as were necessary to be upon duty should be suffered to come on shore probably its being reported that these gentlemen came upon this voyage to make discoveries and observations and possessed extraordinary abilities for such business might occasion these rigid orders They attempted nevertheless to come on shore but were prevented by the guardboat though several of the crew unknown to the centinel stole out of the cabin window at midnight letting themselves down by a rope into the boat and driving away by the tide till they were out of hearing they then rowed to some unfrequented part of the shore where they landed and made excursions up the country though not so far as they could have wished When the Captain went on shore to remonstrate with the Viceroy respecting these restrictions the only answer that could be obtained was that he acted in consequence of his Master's orders Thus situated the Captain resolved to go no more on shore rather than be a prisoner in his own boat as the officer who complimented him with his company waited  upon him both from and to the shore It was now resolved to draw up two memorials to the Viceroy one was written by the Captain the other by Mr Banks they produced answers no way satisfactory Captain Cook and Mr Banks replied and several written remonstrances and answers passed between them and the Viceroy but to no purpose The Captain judging it necessary in vindication of his compliance to urge the Viceroy to some act of force in the execution of his orders he sent Lieutenant Hicks with a packet on the th ordering him not to allow a guard in his boat The officer of the guardboat finding the Lieutenant resolved to obey the Captain's command did not oppose him by force but accompanying the Lieutenant on shore went to the Viceroy and acquainted him with what had passed which induced his Excellency to refuse opening the packet commanding the Lieutenant to return He found a guard had been put on board his boat in his absence and insisted upon the soldiers quitting it The officer now seized the boat's crew and conducted them to prison under an escorte and the Lieutenant was sent back to the ship under a guard When Mr Hicks had acquainted the Captain with these transactions on shore the latter wrote to the Viceroy demanding his boat and men and inclosed the memorial which he would not receive from the hands of the Lieutenant  The bearer of this express was a petty officer in order to avoid continuing the dispute about a guard which a commissioned officer must have kept up Having delivered his packet an answer was promised  In the interim in a sudden gust of wind the longboat with four pipes of rum by the rope breaking that was thrown her from the ship went adrift windward of her with a small skift of Mr Banks's that was fastened to her The misfortune was still greater as the pinnace was on shore The yawl was manned immediately but did not return till next morning when she brought all the people on board From them Captain Cook learnt that the longboat having filled with water they had brought her to a grappling and quitted her and falling in with a reef of rocks on their return they were compelled to cut adrift the little boat belonging to Mr Banks In this situation the Captain dispatched another letter to the Viceroy acquainting him with the accident at the same time desiring he would assist them with a boat to recover their own this was accompanied with a fresh demand of the pinnace and her crew His Excellency at length complied with both the request and demand and the same day they fortunately recovered the longboat and skift In the Viceroy's answer to the Captain's remonstrance he expressed some doubts of the Endeavour being a King's ship and accused the  crew of smuggling Mr Banks's servants had its true by stratagem got on shore the d early in the morning and remained till night but brought on board only plants and insects In Mr Cook's reply he said he was willing to shew his Excellency his commission again the Viceroy having already seen it and that if any attempt to carry on a contraband trade should be repeated desired his Excellency would take the offender into custody Thus terminated the dispute  Mr Banks on the th in the morning artfully eluded the vigilance of the guard and went on shore he avoided the town and passed the day in the fields where the chief objects of his curiosity lay The people behaved with civility invited him to their habitations and he purchased a young pig for eleven shillings and some other things But the next day it was reported that search was making for him and Dr Solander which induced them to lay aside all thoughts of going again on shore  Being prepared for sea with water and provisions they took on board a pilot the st of December but the wind being contrary they were prevented getting out The next day a Spanish packet arrived from Buenos Ayres for Spain when the Captain politely offered to take Mr Cook's dispatches to Europe and he accordingly sent by that conveyance all the papers that had passed between him and the Viceroy  leaving duplicates with his Excellency for his court  The Endeavour did not get under sail till the th when having passed the Fort the pilot was discharged and the guard boat quitted them at the same time During the last three or four days of their remaining at Rio de Janeiro the air was covered with butterflies chiefly of one kind  From the observations of the writer of the first account of this voyage we have the following description of the town and country Rio de Janeiro is supposed to have been thus named on account of its being discovered on the festival of saint Januarius The town which is the capital of the dominions of the Portuguese in America borrows its name from the river Januarius  It is situated on the west side of the river from which it extends itself about three quarters of a mile The ground on which it stands is a level plain it is defended on the north side by a hill that extends from the river leaving a small plain which contains the suburbs and the King's dock On the south side is another hill running towards the mountains which are behind the town Some of its streets run parallel from north to south and are intersected by others at right angles The principal street is near an hundred feet in width and extends from St Benedict to the foot of Castlehill  the other streets are commonly twenty or thirty feet wide The houses adjoining to the principal street have three stories but in other places they are very irregular though built after the same manner as in Lisbon In the town are four convents the first is that of the Benedictines situated near its northern extremity this structure affords an agreeable prospect and contains an elegant chapel which is ornamented with several valuable paintings The second is that of the Carmelites which forms the centre angle of the royal square and fronts the harbour its church had fallen some time before but it is again rebuilding in a very elegant manner with fine freestone brought thither from Lisbon The third is that of St Anthony situated on the point of a hill on the south side of the town before this convent stands a large bason of brown granite in the form of a parallelogram which is employed in washing The fourth is situated at the eastern extremity of the town and was formerly the Jesuits convent but is now converted into a military hospital  The Viceroy's palace forms the right angle of the royal square the palace mint stables goal c compose but one large building which has two stories and is ninety feet from the water In passing through the palace the first entrance is to a large hall or guardroom to which there is an ascent of three or four steps  In the guardroom are stationed the body guards who attend the Viceroy and are relieved every morning between eight and nine Adjoining to the hall are the stables the prison being in the back part of the building Within the guardroom is a flight of stairs for ascending to the upper story this divides at a landingplace about half way and forms two branches one leading to the right and the other to the left The former enters a saloon where there are two officers in constant attendance the Viceroy's aidducamp at the same time waiting in an antichamber to receive messages and deliver orders  The left wing of the royal square is an irregular building which consists chiefly of shops occupied by trading people In the center of the square is a fountain supplied with water from a spring at the distance of three miles from which it is brought by an aqueduct From this fountain both the shipping and inhabitants are supplied with water the place being continually crowded with negroes of both sexes waiting to fill their jars At every corner of the streets is an altar The market place extends from the northeast end of the square along the shore and this situation is very convenient for the fishingboats and those who bring vegetables from the other side of the river to market Negroes are almost the only people employed in selling the different  commodities exposed in the market and they employ their leisure time in spinning of cotton  Without the Jesuits college on the shore is a village called Neustra Seignora del Gloria which is joined to the town by a very few intervening houses Three or four hundred yards within the Jesuits convent stands a very high castle but it is falling to decay The bishop's palace is about three hundred yards behind the Benedictine convent and contiguous to it is a magazine of arms surrounded by a rampart  The gentry here keep their chaises which are drawn by mules the ladies however use a sedan chair boarded before and behind with curtains on each side which is carried by two negroes depending from a pole connected to the top of the chair by two iron rods coming from under its bottom one on each side and resting at the top The inhabitants likewise use hammocks or rajas supported in the same manner and surrounded with curtains  In this town the apothecaries shops commonly serve the purposes of a coffeehouse people meeting in them to drink capillaire and play at backgammon The gentry when seen abroad are well dressed though at home they are but loosely covered the shopkeepers have commonly short hair and wear linen jackets with sleeves Beggars who infest the streets of  most European cities are not to be found in this  With regard to the women it is on all hands agreed that the females of the Portuguese and Spanish settlements in South America are less averse to granting amorous favours than those of any other civilized part of the globe According to Dr Solander's account as soon as the evening began females appeared on all sides in every window and particularized those of the male sex they liked by giving them nosegays the Doctor and two other gentlemen received so many of these bouquets that they threw handfuls away  The climate of Rio de Janeiro is both agreeable and healthy being free from many inconveniencies that are incident to other tropical countries The air is but seldom immoderately hot as the sea breeze constantly begins to blow about ten o'clock in the morning and continues until night when it is generally succeeded by a land wind though this does not always happen The seasons are divided into rainy and dry though their stationary periods have lately bebecome very irregular and uncertain indeed the rainy seasons had almost entirely failed the four years preceding their arrival at which time the rains had just begun and they fell in large quantities during their stay formerly the streets have been overflowed by the rain and rendered impassable except with canoes  The adjacent country is mountainous and chiefly covered with wood but a small part of it appearing to be cultivated The soil near the town is loose and sandy but farther from the river it is a fine black mould It produces all the tropical fruits such as oranges lemons limes melons mangoes cocoanuts c in great abundance and without much cultivation a circumstance which is very agreeable to the inhabitants who are very indolent  The mines which lie far up in the country are very rich but their situation is concealed and nobody can view them except those who work in them The experiment is very dangerous for every one found upon the road which leads to them is hung upon the next tree unless he can give a satisfactory account of the cause of his being in that situation About twelve months before their arrival the government had detected several jewellers in carrying on an illicit trade for diamonds with the slaves in the mines and immediately after a law passed making it felony to work at the trade or have any tools in possession the civil officers having indiscriminately seized on all that could be found Near forty thousand negroes are annually imported to dig in the mines these works are so pernicious to the human frame and occasion so great a mortality amongst the poor wretches employed in them that in the year  twenty thousand more were draughted from the town of Rio to supply the deficiency of the former number  There are several courts of justice in the town at all of which the Viceroy presides in criminal causes the sentence is regulated by a majority of voices in the supreme court The Viceroy has a Council appointed from Europe by the king to assist him in his private department where he has two voices  The inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro maintain a whalefishery which supplies them with lampoil They import their brandy from the Azores their slaves and East India goods from their settlements in Africa their wine from Madeira and their European goods from Lisbon  The current coin is Portuguese which is struck here the silver pieces are called Petacks of different value and the copper are five and ten ree pieces  Rio de Janeiro is very useful for ships that are in want of refreshment the harbour is safe and commodious and may be distinguished by a remarkable hill in the shape of a cone at the west point of the bay The entrance is not wide but it is easy from the sea breeze which prevails from noon to sunset for any ship to enter before the wind The entrance of the narrow part is defended by two forts La Cruz and Lozia they are about three quarters of a  mile from each other The bottom being rocky renders it dangerous to anchor here but this may be avoided by keeping the middle of the channel The whole coast abounds with a very great variety of fish among which are dolphins and mackrel  On the th of December they took out of the sea an incredible number of atoms of a yellowish colour few of them more than the th part of an inch in length it could not even with a microscope be determined whether they were animal or vegetable substances These atoms tinged the sea in such a manner as to cover it with broad streaks of a colour similar to themselves the greatest part of a mile in length and several hundred yards in width  Thursday December having procured all necessary supplies they left Rio de Janeiro they did not meet with any material occurrence from this time to the d when they discovered numerous birds of the Prosillaria genus in latitude degrees minutes south and longitude degrees minutes west they were also frequently surrounded by great numbers of porpoises of a singular species which were about fifteen feet in length and of an ashcolour On the d they observed an eclipse of the moon and about seven o'clock in the morning a small white cloud appeared in the west from which a train of fire issued extending  itself westerly about two minutes after they heard two distinct loud explosions immediately succeeding each other like canon after which the cloud soon disappeared  On the th they caught a large loggerhead tortoise weighing one hundred and fifty pounds They likewise shot several birds among which was an albetross measuring between the tips of its wings nine feet and an inch and from its beak to the tail two feet one inch and an half On the th they ran upwards of fifty leagues through vast numbers of land insects some in the air and others upon the water they appeared to resemble exactly the flies that are seen in England though they were thirty leagues from land and some of these insects never quit it beyond a few yards Captain Cook imagined he was at this time nearly opposite to the bay called Sans fond without bottom where it is supposed by some writers that the continent of America is divided by a passage but it was the opinion of the gentlemen on board that there might be a large river which probably had occasioned an inundation The st they had much thunder lightning and rain this and the three following days they saw several whales and likewise several birds about the size of a pidgeon with white bellies and grey beaks  January they saw an appearance of land which they mistook for Pepys' island  but on their standing towards it it proved what the sailors call a Fog Bank The ship's crew were about this time on their complaining of cold furnished with each a pair of trowsers and a jacket made of the stuff called Fearnought They saw on the th after passing Falkland's Island at about four leagues distance Terra Del Fuego Smoke was perceived which they took for a signal as it did not continue after they had passed along the shore to the southeast On the th they entered the streight of Le Maire but the tide being against them they were driven out with great violence and the waves ran so high that the ship's bowsprit was frequently under water at length however they got anchorage at the entrance of a little cove which Captain Cook called ST VINCENT'S BAY  The weeds which here grow upon rocky ground are very remarkable they appear above the surface in eight and nine fathoms water the leaves are four feet in length and many of the stalks though not more than an inch and a half in circumference above Mr Banks and Dr Solander having been on shore some hours they returned with more than a hundred different plants and flowers hitherto unnoticed by the European botanists The country in general near the bay was flat and the bottom particularly was a plain covered with grass here was plenty of wood water and fowl winter's  bark was found in great abundance The trees are a species of the birch but are neither lofty nor large the wood is white and they bear a small leaf Here are also white and red cranberries  Sunday having anchored in fathoms upon coral rocks before a small cove distant from shore about a mile two of the natives came down upon the beach in expectation that they would land but this situation affording little shelter the Captain got under sail again and the natives retired  About two o'clock they anchored in the bay of Good Success and the Captain went on shore accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander to search for a wateringplace and confer with the Indians These gentlemen proceeded about a hundred yards before the Captain when two of the Indians having advanced forward and seated themselves they rose upon Mr Banks and the Doctor's coming up and each of them threw away a small stick which they had before in their hands this they did in such a direction that the sticks flew both from themselves and the strangers which they meant as a token of peace and a testimonial of their renouncing weapons they then returned briskly towards their companions who had remained at some distance behind and made signs to the strangers to advance which they accordingly complied with The reception the gentlemen  met with was friendly though the manner was uncouth The civility was returned by the distribution of beads and ribbons with which the Indians were much pleased After a mutual confidence had been thus established the rest of the English party joined and a general conversation though of a singular kind ensued Three of the Indians now returned with the Captain and his friends to the ship whom they cloathed with jackets and gave them bread jerked beef c part of which they eat and carried the remainder on shore They refused to drink rum or brandy after tasting them intimating by signs that it burnt their throats This circumstance may perhaps corroborate the opinion of those who think water the natural drink of mankind as of all other animals One of these Indians made several long and loud speeches though no part of either was intelligible to any of us Another of them stole the covering of a globe which he concealed under his skin garment After remaining on board about two hours they returned on shore Mr Banks accompanying them He conducted them to their companions who appeared no way curious to know what their friends had seen and the latter were as little disposed to relate as the others were to enquire None of these people exceeded five feet ten inches in height yet their bodies appeared large and robust though their limbs  were small They had broad flat faces low foreheads high cheeks noses inclining to flatness wide nostrils small black eyes large mouths small but indifferent teeth and black strait hair falling down over their ears and forehead which was commonly smeared with brown and red paints and like all the original natives of America they were beardless Their garments were the skins of guanicos and seals which they wrapped round their shoulders The men likewise wear on their heads a bunch of yarn spun from the wool of guanicos which falls over their foreheads and ties behind with the sinews or tendons of some animal Many of both sexes were painted in different parts of their bodies with red white and brown colours and had also three or four perpendicular lines pricked across their cheeks and noses The women have a small string tied round each ancle and wear each a flap of skin tied round the middle They carry the children on their backs and are generally employed in domestic labour and drudgery  Mr Banks and Dr Solander attended by servants set out from the ship on the th in the morning with the design of going into the country as far as they could that day and returning in the evening Having entered a wood they ascended the hill through a pathless wilderness till the afternoon After they had reached what they had taken for a plain they  were greatly disappointed in finding it a swamp covered with birch the bushes interwoven and so inflexible they could not be divided however as they were not above three feet high they stept over them but they were up to the ancles in the boggy ground The morning had been very fine but the weather now became cold and disagreeable the blasts of wind were very piercing and a shower of snow fell They nevertheless pursued their route in expectation of finding a better road Before they had got over this swamp an accident happened that greatly disconcerted them Mr Buchan one of the draughtsmen Mr Banks had brought out fell into a fit It was absolutely necessary to stop and kindle a fire and such as were most fatigued remained to assist him but Messrs Banks Solander Green and Monkhouse proceeded and attained the spot they had in view Here they found a great variety of plants that gratified their curiosity and repaid them for their toil  Upon returning to the rest of the company amidst the snow which fell in greater abundance and being pinched with the cold that was now become more intense they found Mr Buchan much recovered They had previously sent Mr Monkhouse and Mr Green back to Mr Buchan and those who remained with him in order to bring them to a hill which was conjectured to lie in a better track for returning  to the wood and was accordingly fixed on as a place of rendezvous They resolved from this hill to pass through the swamp which this way did not appear to be more than half a mile in extent into the covert of the wood in which they proposed building a hut and kindling a fire to defend them from the severity of the weather The whole party accordingly met at the place appointed about eight in the evening whilst it was still daylight and proceeded towards the next valley Dr Solander having often passed mountains in cold countries was sensible that extreme cold when joined with fatigue occasions a drowsiness that is not easily resisted he accordingly intreated his friends to keep in motion however disagreeable it might be to them his words were  "Whoever sits down will sleep and whoever sleeps will wake no more"  Every one seemed accordingly armed with resolution but on a sudden the cold became so very intense as to threaten the most direful effects It was very remarkable that Dr Solander himself who had so forcibly admonished and alarmed his party should be the first who insisted upon being suffered to repose In spite of the most earnest intreaties of his friends he lay down amidst the snow and it was with great difficulty they kept the Doctor awake One of the black servants became also weary and faint and was upon the point of following the Doctor's example Mr  Buchan was therefore detached with a party to make a fire at the first commodious spot they could meet with Mr Banks with four more remained with the Doctor and Richmond the black who with the utmost difficulty were induced to come on but when they had traversed the greatest part of the swamp they expressed their inability of going any farther When the black was informed that if he remained there he would soon be frozen to death he replied that he was so exhausted with fatigue that death would be a relief to him Doctor Solander said he was not unwilling to go but that he must first take some sleep notwithstanding what he had before declared to the company Thus resolved they both sat down supported by bushes and in a short time fell fast asleep Intelligence now came from the advanced party that a fire was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way Mr Banks then waked the Doctor who had almost lost the use of his limbs already though it was but a few minutes since he sat down he nevertheless consented to go on Every measure taken to relieve the black proved ineffectual he remained motionless and they were obliged to leave him to the care of the other black servant and a sailor who appeared to have been the least hurt by the cold and they were to be relieved as soon as two others were sufficiently warmed to supply their places The Doctor  was with much difficulty got to the fire Those who were sent to relieve the companions of Richmond returned in about half an hour without being able to find them What rendered the mortification still greater was that a bottle of rum the whole stock of the party could not be found and was judged to have been left to one of the three who were missing There was a fall of snow which incessantly continued for near two hours and there remained no hopes of seeing the three absentees again at least alive About o'clock however a great shouting was heard at a distance which gave inexpressible satisfaction to every one present Mr Banks and four others went forth and met the sailor with just strength enough to walk he was immediately sent to the fire and they proceeded to seek for the two others They found Richmond upon his legs but incapable of moving them the other black was lying senseless upon the ground All endeavours to bring them to the fire were fruitless nor was it possible to kindle one upon the spot on account of the snow that had fallen and was still falling so that there was no alternative and they were compelled to leave the two unfortunate negroes to their fate making them however a bed of boughs of trees and covering them very thick with the same  As all hands had been employed in endeavouring to move the two blacks to the fire and  had therefore been exposed to the cold for near an hour and a half some of them began to be afflicted in the same manner as those they went to relieve Briscoe another of Mr Banks's servants in particular began to lose his sensibility They at length reached the fire and passed the night in a very disagreeable manner The party that set out from the ship consisted of twelve of whom two were already judged to be dead it was doubtful whether a third would be able to return on board and Mr Buchan a fourth seemed threatened again with his fits The ship was at the distance of a long day's journey through an unfrequented wood in which they might probably be bewildered till night and being equipped only for a journey of a few hours they had not provisions left sufficient to afford the company a single meal  On the th in the morning at daybreak nothing presented itself to view all around but snow the trees being equally covered with it as the ground and the blasts of wind were so violent and frequent that their journey was rendered impracticable and there was much reason to dread perishing with cold and famine However about six in the morning they were flattered with a dawn of hope of being delivered by discovering the sun through the clouds which gradually diminished Previous to their setting out messengers were dispatched to the  unhappy negroes who returned with the melancholy news of their death  Though the sky had flattered their hopes the snow still continued falling very fast which prevented them beginning their journey so soon as was proposed but a breeze springing up about o'clock added to the influence of the sun began to clear the air and the snow falling in large flakes from the trees announced a thaw The force of hunger prevailed over every other consideration and induced them after having equally divided the small remains of their provisions to set forward on their journey about in the morning  In about three hours to their great astonishment and satisfaction they found themselves upon the shore much nearer to the ship than their most sanguine expectations could have flattered them When they took a retrospect of their former route from the sea they found that instead of ascending the hill in a direct line they had made a circle almost round the country The congratulations every one on board expressed at their return can better be imagined than expressed  On the th Mr Banks and Dr Solander went again on shore and landed in the bottom of the bay when they collected many shells and plants hitherto unknown They returned on board to dinner and afterwards went to visit an Indian town about two miles up the country  The access was difficult on account of the mud When they approached the town two of the Indians came out to meet them they began to shout in the same unmeaning manner as they had before done on board the ship After this had continued for some time they conducted Mr Banks and the Doctor to the town It was seated on a small hill overshaded with wood and consisted of about a dozen huts constructed without art or regularity They were composed of a few poles inclining towards each other in the shape of a sugarloaf which were covered on the weatherside with grass and boughs and on the other side a space was left open which served at once for a fireplace and a door The huts that had been seen in St Vincent's Bay were of the same kind A little grass served for beds and chairs and their utensils consisted of a basket for the hand a satchel to hang upon the back and a bladder for water out of which they drank through a hole near the top This town was inhabited by a small tribe consisting of about men women and children Their bows and arrows were constructed with neatness and ingenuity they were made of wood highly polished and the point which was either glass or flint was fitted with much skill Mr Banks observed glass and flint amongst them unwrought with cloth canvass rings and buttons c it was therefore judged that they travelled at times to the north as no ship  View of a To  in the Island of Terra del Fuego  had touched at this part of Terra del Fuego for some years  Neither did they testify any surprise at the sight of firearms and appeared to be well acquainted with their use Probably the spot on which Mr Banks and the Doctor met them was not a fixed habitation their houses not being erected to stand any length of time and they were destitute of a boat or canoe They did not seem to have any form of government among them nor did there appear any kind of subordination These people appeared upon the whole to be the outcasts of human nature whose lives were passed in wandering in a forlorn manner over dreary wasteswhose only dwelling was a wretched hovel such as has been described and their cloaths scarcely sufficient to prevent their perishing with cold in the summer of this country much less in the extreme severity of winter their only food was shellfish which must soon be exhausted at any one spot destitute of every convenience arising from the rudest art or even an implement to dress their food Such were these people who nevertheless appeared content so little does refinement or luxury promote happiness  They observed no quadruped animals except seals sealions and dogs Mr Banks saw from a hill the impression of the footsteps of a large beast on the surface of a bog but he could not determine of what kind it was This gentleman  observed no landbirds larger than an English blackbird except hawks and vultures there were however ducks and other water fowl in abundance likewise shellfish muscles clams and limpets in great plenty  It is remarkable that in this country though uncleared there was no species of hurtful or troublesome animals Mr Banks and Dr Solander found a great variety of plants The beach and the birch may be used for timber The scurvygrass and wild celery it is imagined contain antiscorbutic qualities and may therefore be of service to the crews of such ships as hereafter touch at this place The former is found in abundance near springs and in damp places particularly at the wateringplace in the Bay of Good Success and resembles the cuckowflower or lady'ssmock in England The wildcelery resembles the celery in our gardens but the leaves are of a deeper green It grows in great plenty near the beach and upon the land above the springtides and tastes like parsley mixed with celery In the morning of Sunday January Captain Cook having got in his wood and water sailed out of the bay and steered his course through the streight  The generality of writers who have described the island of Terra del Fuego have represented it as covered with snow and destitute of wood In this however they are evidently mistaken  and their error must have arisen from having visited it in the winter season when it possibly is covered with snow The crew of the Endeavour perceived trees when they were at a considerable distance from the island and on their nearer approach they found the sea coast and the sides of the hills clothed with an agreeable verdure The summit of the hills are barren but the vallies are rich and a brook is to be found at the foot of almost every hill the water has a reddish tinge but is not ill tasted and was some of the best Captain Cook took in during his whole voyage  The streight of Le Maire is bounded on the west by Terra del Fuego and on the east by the west end of Staten Land and is near five leagues in length and as many in breadth The bay of Good Success is seated about the middle of it on the side of Terra del Fuego which presents itself upon entering the streight from the northward and the south head of it may be distinguished by a landmark resembling a road from the sea to the country It affords good anchorage and plenty of wood and water Staten Land did not appear to Captain Cook in the manner described in Lord Anson's Voyage the horror and wildness with which it is there depicted was not discernable to Mr Banks and the other gentlemen on the contrary the land was neither destitute of wood nor verdure nor covered with snow and on  the north side there appeared bays and harbours This difference may also probably arise from their not having visited the place in the same season of the year  Thursday January Capt Cook sailed from Cape Horn The farthest southern latitude he made was degrees minutes by degrees minutes west The weather being very calm Mr Banks sailed in a small boat to shoot birds when he killed some sheerwaters and albatrosses the latter were larger than those caught to the north of the streight the sheerwaters were less and their backs darker coloured The albatrosses proved very good eating  Notwithstanding the doubling of Cape Horn is represented as a very dangerous course and that it is generally thought passing through the streight of Magellan is less perilous the Endeavour doubled it with as little danger as the North Foreland on the Kentish coast the heavens were fair the wind temperate the weather pleasant and being near shore they had a very distinct view of the coast  Wednesday March Captain Cook was in latitude degrees minutes south and longitude degrees minutes west as well by observation as by the log which concurrence after a course of leagues was judged very singular from whence it was plain he had no currents that affected the ship and most probably  had not approached any land of great extent as there are always currents near lands of considerable compass Mr Banks killed more than sixty birds in one day and he caught two forest flies of the same species but never yet described he also found a cuttle fish which had just been killed by the birds it was different from the fishes of this name met with in the European seas having a double row of sharp talons resembling those of a cat which issued or retracted at will This fish made excellent soup  Saturday the th on account of a squabble about a bit of sealskin which he had taken in a frolic but which was represented to his officer as a theft one of the marines a young fellow about twenty threw himself overboard and was drowned  About o'clock Tuesday April Peter Briscoe servant to Mr Banks discovered land to the south about three or four leagues distant The Captain immediately hauled up for it and found it to be an island of an oval form with a lake or lagoon in the center that extended over the greatest part of it the border of land which surrounded the lake was in many places low and narrow especially towards the south where the beach consisted of a reef of rocks three places on the north side had the same appearance This dismembrance of the firm land made the whole resemble several woody islands To the west was a large clump of trees and in the center two cocoanut trees  Captain Cook came within a mile on the north side but though he cast a line of fathom he found no bottom and could not meet with any anchorage The island appeared covered with trees of different sorts but the gentlemen on board could not ascertain any with glasses except palmnuts and cocoanuts there were several natives visible on shore they seemed tall with remarkable large heads which might probably be increased by some bandage their hair was black and their complexions copper colour There appeared along the beach abreast of the ship some of these inhabitants with pikes or poles in their hands which seemed twice the height of themselves they at this time appeared naked but when they retired upon the ship's passing the island they put on a covering of a light colour Some clumps of palmtrees served them for habitations and at a distance resembled hilly ground and the groves had a very happy effect This island was in latitude degrees south longitude west and was named LAGOON ISLAND  Captain Cook saw land again in the afternoon to the northwest He reached it by sunset when it appeared a low island covered with wood in form circular about a mile in circumference No inhabitants were visible nor any cocoanut trees though the Endeavour had reached the shore within half a mile yet the sland appeared covered with verdure of various tinges This island which is distant from that  of Lagoon about seven leagues north west The gentlemen on board named THRUMB CAP  Wednesday the th they continued their course with a fine trade wind and about three o'clock discovered land to the west This was a low island between and leagues in circumference it resembled in form a bow the cord and arch forming the land and the interstice marking the water the beach was flat without any visible herbage upon it being covered with seaweeds Its length was between three and four leagues and its width about yards the bow terminated with two large tufts of cocoanut trees the arch was covered with trees of various heights and of different verdure some parts of it however was low and resembled the cord They sailed along the beach within a league till sunset when they judged they were half way between the two tufts of trees here they sounded This island from the smoke that was discovered appeared to be inhabited and it was named BOW ISLAND Captain Cook's second Lieutenant Mr Gore said after they had sailed by the island that he had perceived several of the natives under the first clump of trees that he had discriminated their houses and observed many canoes hauled up But he was the only person who made these observations though there were several upon deck besides himself  About noon on Thursday the th they saw  land again to the west and at three o'clock they came up with it This land seemed divided into two islands or rather collections of islands their extent being near nine leagues The two largest were divided from each other by a streight of near half a mile in breadth  Some of these islands were ten miles or more in length but appeared like long narrow strings of land not above a quarter of a mile broad they seemed however to produce trees of different kinds among which was the cocoanut tree Several of the inhabitants came out in their canoes and two of them appeared to have a design of coming on board but they with the rest stopped at the reef When Captain Cook had got about a league from the shore he perceived some of the natives following in a canoe with a sail he did not think proper to wait for her and though she had passed the reef she discontinued her course These people appeared to be about our size and well made their complexion was brown and they seemed naked they had for the most part two weapons in their hands one was a thin long pole with a kind of spear at the end the other resembled a paddle some of their canoes were constructed to carry not more than three men others had on board six or seven one hoisted a sail which upon the falling of a shower of rain was taken down and converted into an awning It could not be determined  whether the signals made by the people on shore were designed to deter the Endeavour's company from landing or as an invitation to come on shore these waved their hats the others answered by shouting The Captain did not judge it prudent or merciful to be convinced in this respect as the island appeared of no importance and the crew were not destitute of any thing it could produce and as it must have proved a bloody contest on the side of the unarmed Indians This curiosity was therefore laid aside in expectation of soon discovering the island where they had been directed to make their astronomical observations the natives of which it is reasonable to conjecture would make no opposition to the landing of the gentlemen on board having already experienced the danger of resistance  Captain Cook discovered another island on the seventh about six in the morning which was judged to be in compass about five miles It was very low with a piece of water in the center and appeared to abound in wood and to be covered with verdure but no inhabitants were visible It was called BIRD ISLAND from the number of birds that were flying about  Saturday in the afternoon they saw land to the north and in the evening came abreast of it at about five miles distance This land seemed to be a chain of low islands it was of an oval figure and consisted of coral and sand  with a few clumps of small trees and in the middle of it was a lagoon It was from its appearance called CHAIN ISLAND They saw smoke which arose from different parts by which they were convinced it was inhabited  On Monday the th after a tempestuous night Captain Cook saw Osnaburgh Island it is called by the natives Maite This island is high and circular about four miles in circumference it is partly naked and rocky and partly covered with trees  The same day upon their looking out for the island to which they were destined they saw land ahead The next morning it appeared very high and mountainous and it was known to be King George the IIId's Island so named by Captain Wallis but by the natives called Otaheite The calms prevented the Endeavour from approaching it till the morning of the th when a breeze springing up before several canoes were making towards the ship only a few approached and the people on board those that came the nearest would not come on board Captain Cook Each canoe had in it young plantains and branches of trees They were brought as Captain Cook was afterwards informed as tokens of peace and friendship and they were handed up the sides of the ship by the people in one of the canoes who made signals in a very expressive manner intimating that they desired these emblems of pacification  should be placed in a conspicuous part of the ship and they were accordingly stuck amongst the rigging at which they testified their approbation Their cargoes consisting of cocoanuts bananas breadfruit apples and figs which were very acceptable to the crew and were then purchased  In the evening they opened the northwest point and saw York Island so named by the crew of the Dolphin They lay off and on all night and in the morning of the th they entered Port Royal Harbour in the island of Otaheite and anchored within half a mile of the shore A great number of the natives immediately came off in their canoes bringing with them bananas cocoanuts breadfruit apples and some hogs which they bartered with the ship's crew for beads and other trinkets  The tree that bears the breadfruit is about the size of the horsechesnut its leaves are near a foot and a half long in shape oblong resembling in almost every respect those of the figtree its fruit is not unlike the cantaloupe melon either in size or shape it is inclosed in a thin skin and its core is as large as a person's thumb it is somewhat of the consistency of new bread and as white as the blanched almon it divides into parts and they roast it before it is eaten it has little or no taste An elderly man named  Owhaw  who was known to Mr Gore and others who had visited this island with Captain Wallis came on  board and as he was considered a useful man the Captain endeavoured to gratify all his enquiries Captain Cook now drew up several necessary rules for the regulation of their traffic with the inhabitants and ordered that they should be punctually observed  When the ship was properly secured the Captain went on shore with Mr Banks and Dr Solander a party under arms and their friend the old Indian They were received on shore by some hundreds of the natives who were struck with such awe that the first who approached crept almost upon his hands and knees He also presented to them branches of trees the usual symbol of peace This symbol was received on the part of the English gentlemen with demonstrations of satisfaction and friendship and noticing that while each of the Indians held one of these branches in his hand they gathered some and followed the example of the natives  They were conducted by the old Indian accompanied by his countrymen towards the place where the Dolphin had watered here the ground being cleared the chiefs of the natives threw down their boughs and the Captain and his companions followed the example after having drawn up the marines who marching in order dropped their branches upon those of the Indians When they came to the wateringplace the Indians intimated that they had  their permission to occupy that ground but it was not suited to their purpose In the course of this walk and a circuit through the woods the Indians had got rid of their timidity and became familiarized On the way they received beads and other small presents at which they expressed great pleasure  The whole circuit was near four miles thro' groves consisting of trees of cocoanuts and breadfruit Beneath which trees were the habitations of the natives consisting of only a roof destitute of walls In this peregrination the gentlemen were not a little disappointed at finding very few fowls or hogs Captain Cook was informed by such of the party as had been here with the Dolphin that none of the people hitherto seen were of the first rank and they imagined the Queen's residence was moved no traces remaining of it Next morning before they left the ship several canoes came about her filled with people whose dress denoted them of the superior class two of these came on board and each of them fixed upon a friend one of them chose Mr Banks and the other Captain Cook The ceremony consisted of taking off their cloaths in great part and putting them upon their adopted friends This compliment was returned by presenting them some trinkets They then made signs for these gentlemen to go with them to the place of their abode and the Captain being desirous  of meeting with a more convenient harbour and knowing more of the people readily assented Accordingly the Captain Mr Banks Dr Solander with the Indians and other friends got into two boats About three miles distance they landed among several hundreds of the natives who conducted them to a large house Upon their entrance they saw a middle aged man named  Tootahah  who as soon as they were seated ordered a cock and hen to be produced which he presented to Mr Banks and the Captain as well as a piece of perfumed cloth which compliment was returned by a present from Mr Banks They were then conducted with great civility to several large houses constructed in the same manner as those already described the ladies so far from shunning invited and even pressed them to be seated Whilst they were afterwards walking along the shore they met accompanied by a great number of natives another Chief named  Tubora Tumaida  with whom they settled a treaty of peace in the manner before described Tubora Tumaida intimated he had provisions for them if they chose to eat and they accordingly dined heartily upon breadfruit plantains and fish  In the course of this visit Tomio the wife of the Chief placed herself upon the same matt with Mr Banks close by him but she not being young nor appearing ever to have possessed  many charms to these causes may be ascribed the little attention this gentleman paid her and Tomio received the additional mortification of Mr Banks's beckoning to a pretty girl who with some reluctance came and seated herself by him The Princess was somewhat mortified at the preference given to her rival nevertheless she continued her assiduities to him This whimsical scene was interrupted by an event of a serious nature Dr Solander having discovered that he had lost an opera glass they complained to the Chief and interrupted the convivial party This complaint was enforced by Mr Banks's starting up and striking the butt end of his musket on the ground which struck the Indians with a panic and they all precipitately ran out of the house except the Chief and a few others of the superior class  The Chief appeared much concerned at this accident not as we had reason afterwards to believe that he had any aversion to knavish practices but because he feared that this early instance of dishonesty might give us unfavourable suspicions of his countrymen and thereby deprive him of those advantages and emoluments which they expected to gain from us and which by various artifices they afterwards secured when our connexion with them became more intimate The chief therefore to obviate any disadvantageous impressions gave us to understand with an appearance of great  probity that the place which the Doctor had mentioned was not within his district but that he would send to the Chief of it and endeavour if possible to have the glass recovered but that if this could not be done he would make the Doctor compensation by giving him as much new cloth of which he shewed large quantities as should be thought equal to its value The case however was in a little time brought and the glass itself soon after which deprived us of the merit we should otherwise have had in refusing the cloth which had been offered us But it afforded an opportunity of convincing the natives of our generosity by lavishing rewards on them for an action to which selfinterest had been the motive rather than any sentiment of probity to which from numerous transactions they appeared to be absolute strangers After this adventure was amicably terminated they returned to the ship about six o'clock in the evening  Saturday the th in the morning several of the Chiefs one of whom was very corpulent came on board from the other point bringing with them hogs breadfruit and other refreshments in exchange for which they gave them hatchets linen beads and other trinkets but some of them took the liberty of stealing the top of the lightening chain This day the Captain attended by Mr Banks and some of the other gentlemen went ashore to fix on a  proper spot to erect a small fort for their defence during their stay on the island and the ground was accordingly marked out for that purpose A great number of the natives looking on all the while and behaving in the most peaceable and friendly manner  Mr Banks having suspected from seeing few hogs or poultry in their walks that they had upon the ship's arrival been driven farther up the country it was resolved to penetrate into the woods some marines and a petty officer being appointed to guard the tent in the interim several of the natives accompanied the gentlemen in this excursion Upon crossing a little river Mr Banks perceiving some ducks fired and killed three The Indians were struck with the utmost terror at this event which occasioned them to fall suddenly to the ground as if they had been shot at the same time they recovered however presently from their fright and continued the march Before this party had gone much farther they were alarmed by the discharge of two pieces fired by the tentguard Owhaw after calling together the Captain's party dispersed all the Indians except three who broke branches of trees as pledges of their fidelity Upon their return to the tent it appeared that an Indian had taken an opportunity to snatch away one of the centinels musquets whereupon a young midshipman under whose command the party was very imprudently  ordered the marines to fire which they did immediately amongst the thickest of the fugitive Indians in number above a hundred several of whom were wounded but as the criminal did not fall they pursued and shot him dead  When Mr Banks heard of the affair he was greatly displeased with the guard and he used his utmost endeavours to accommodate the difference going across the river and through the mediation of an old man prevailed on many of the natives to come over to them bringing plantaintrees their usual signal of peace and clapping their hands in their breasts they cried  Tyau  which signifies friendship In a short time they became social and chearful and seemed for the present to have buried in oblivion the wanton acts of cruelty which had been so lately exercised on their fellow countrymen  Few of the natives appeared next morning upon the beach and not one of them came on board From hence Mr Banks and the other gentlemen concluded that their apprehensions were not intirely removed more especially as even Owhaw had forsaken them The Captain in consequence of these disagreeable appearances brought the ship nearer to shore and moored her so as to make her broad side bear on the spot which had been marked for erecting the fort The Captain went on shore in the evening with some of the gentlemen  when the Indians assembled round them and they trafficked together in a friendly manner  Mr Banks had the misfortune of losing Mr Buchan on the th  The same day they received on board a visit from Tubora Tumaida and Tootahah As tokens of peace they brought with them some plantain branches and would not risk themselves on board till these had been received being probably alarmed at the affair of the tent They also brought some breadfruit and a hog ready dressed in return for which they received some nails  The fort began to be erected on the th Some of the company were employed in throwing up intrenchments whilst others were occupied in cutting fascines and pickets which the Indians of their own accord chearfully assisted in bringing from the woods Three sides of the fort were fortified with intrenchments and pallisades and on the other which was flanked by a river the watercasks being filled were placed so as to form a breastwork  This day the natives brought down such quantities of breadfruit and cocoanuts that it was necessary to reject them and to intimate to them that the company would not want any for two days Beads were trafficked this day for every thing Mr Banks's tent being got up he for the first time slept on shore No Indian attempted to approach it the whole night  however a precaution had been taken to place proper centinels about it  Wednesday Tubora Tumaida visited Mr Banks at his tent and brought with him besides his wife and family the materials for erecting a house in the neighbourhood of the fort where he designed to reside some time after he had reached the tent he requested Mr Banks to accompany him back to the woods on their arrival at a place where he occasionally resided he presented him with two garments one of which was of red cloth and the other of very fine matting in which having clothed Mr Banks he conducted him to the ship and with his wife and son staid to dinner they had a dish served up which was prepared by one of Tubora Tumaida's attendants not unlike in taste to what in England is called flummery of this dish the natives seemed exceedingly fond but the English could not relish it Tubora Tumaida had likewise brought with him some food which appeared like the flower of wheat this being mixed with cocoanut liquor and some hot stones put into it was stirred about till it became a thick jelly on tasting it they found it of an agreeable flavour not very inferior to good blanc mange  Without the lines a sort of market was established which was tolerably well supplied Tubora Tumaida became Mr Banks's and the other gentlemens frequent guest he adopted  their manners and was the only one of his countrymen who had attempted to use a knife and fork  Mr Monkhouse the Surgeon said he had seen in his evening walk the body of the man who had been shot at the tent It was deposited in a shed close to the house where he had resided when alive and others were within ten yards of it It was in length about fifteen feet and eleven in breadth and the height was proportionable the two sides and one end were partly enclosed with a sort of wickerwork the other end was entirely open The corps was deposited on a bier the frame of which was wood with a matted bottom supported by posts about five feet high The corps was covered with a matt and over that a white cloth by its side lay a wooden mace and towards the head two cocoanut shells towards the feet was a bunch of green leaves and small dried boughs tied together and stuck in the ground near which was a stone the size of a cocoanut here was also placed a young plantaintree and a stone axe A great number of palmnuts were hung in strings at the open end of the shed and the stem of a plantaintree was stuck up without the shed upon this stem was placed a cocoanut shell filled with fresh water At the side of one of the posts there hung a little bag with some roasted pieces of breadfruit The natives did not seem pleased at his approaching  the body their jealousy and uneasiness being very visibly depicted in their countenances  The flies on shore were so very tormenting that they were obliged to destroy them with musqueto nets and fly traps  They had a specimen of the music of the country on the d some of the natives performing on flutes which had only two stops they were blown like the German flute but the performer blew with his nostril instead of his mouth several others sung only one tune to this instrument  Some of the Indians brought the English axes to grind and repair most of which they had received from the Dolphin but a French one occasioned much speculation and it at length appeared to have been left here by Mr de Bougainville  On the th Mr Banks and Dr Solander made an excursion into the country which they found to be level and fertile for about two miles along the shore to the eastward after which the hills reached quite to the water's edge and farther on they ran out into the sea After passing these hills which continued about three miles they discovered a large plain abounding with good houses inhabited by people who seemed to be in affluence A very wide river issuing from a valley added greatly to the beauty of this place they crossed this river and perceived the country to be again  A Musical Youth of the  Discovered Islands in the Habit of his Profession  A Fly Fan  barren which determined them to return but just as they had taken this resolution they were offered some refreshment by one of the natives a man at some authors describe to be mixed with many nations but different from them all his skin being of a dead white though some parts of his body were not so white as others his hair eyebrows and beard were as white as his skin The great joy of Tubora Tumaida and his women who met them as they returned is not to be expressed  On the th several of their knives were missing upon which Mr Banks who had lost his among the rest accused Tubora Tumaida with having stolen it which caused him to be very unhappy as he happened to be innocent of the fact Mr Banks's servant having mislaid it and the rest were produced in a rag by a native The Indian was some time before he would forget this accusation the tears starting from his eyes and he made signs with the knife that if he had ever been guilty of such an action as was imputed to him he would suffer his throat to be cut However in general these people from the highest to the lowest are the greatest thieves in the world  On the th six swivel guns were mounted upon the fort which put the natives into great consternation and caused several fishermen who lived upon the point to remove farther off imagining they were to be fired at in a few days  The next day Tubora Tumaida with a friend a remarkable glutton and three of his women dined at the fort after which he set out for his house in the wood In a short time he returned in much agitation to acquaint Mr Banks that the ship's butcher had threatened to cut his wife's throat upon her refusing to sell him a stone hatchet which he had taken a fancy to for a nail It clearly appeared he had been culpable and he was flogged on board in sight of several of the Indians As soon as the first stroke was given they interfered and earnestly intreated that he might be untied This being refused they burst into tears and shewed great concern  On Friday one of Tubora Tumaida's female attendants came down to the fort in the greatest affliction the tears gushing from her eyes and full of lamentation Mr Banks seeing her insisted upon knowing the cause but instead of answering she struck herself several times with a shark's tooth upon the head till she caused a great effusion of blood while her distress was unnoticed by several other Indians who continued laughing and talking with the utmost unconcern After this she gathered up some pieces of cloth which she had thrown down to catch the blood and threw them into the sea as if she wished to obliterate her absurd behaviour She then bathed herself in the river and with remarkable chearfulness  returned to the tent as if nothing extraordinary had happened  During the forenoon of this day canoes were continually coming in and the tents at the fort were filled with people of both sexes Mr Molineux Master of the Endeavour went on shore and seeing a woman whose name was Oberea he declared she was the person he judged to be the queen of the island when he came there on board the Dolphin in the last voyage  The eyes of every one were now fixed on her who had made so distinguished a figure in the accounts that had been given by the first discoverers of this island The person of the queen Oberea was of a large make and tall she was about forty years of age her skin white her eyes had great expression and meaning in them she had been handsome but her beauty was now upon the decline She was soon conducted to the ship and went on board accompanied with some of her family Many presents were made her particularly a child's doll which seemed the most to engross her attention Captain Cook accompanied her on shore and as soon as they landed she presented him with a hog and some plantains which were carried to the fort in procession Oberea and the Captain bringing up the rear They met Tootahah who though not King seemed to be at this time invested with a sovereign authority He immediately became jealous of the Queen's  having the doll which made them find it necessary to compliment him with one also A doll now was preferable to a hatchet though it was not considered so long as they soon were looked upon as trifles of little or no value  The ship's provisions seemed to be very acceptable to the men but the women were shy of tasting any of them They were solicited strongly this day to dine with the gentlemen but they refused and chose to partake of plantains with the servants a mystery that could not be explained  On Saturday in the forenoon Mr Banks paid a visit to Oberea who was still asleep under the awning of her canoe whither he went with an intention of calling her up Upon entering her chamber to his great surprise he found her in bed with a handsome young fellow about five and twenty upon which he immediately retired with some precipitation not a little disconcerted at this discovery but he was soon given to understand that such amours were by no means considered scandalous and that Obadie the person found in bed with the queen was by every one known to have been selected by her as the object of her lascivious hours The queen soon got up and dressed herself to wait upon Mr Banks After dressing him in a suit of fine cloth they proceeded together to the tents Mr Banks paid a visit in the evening to Tubora Tumaida and  was greatly surprized to find him and his family all in tears he in vain attempted to discover the cause and soon took leave of them Upon his return he was told by the officers that Owhaw had foretold that the guns would be fired in four days and as this was the eve of the third day they were alarmed at the situation they judged themselves to be in In consequence of this intelligence they doubled the centries at the fort and the gentlemen slept under arms Mr Banks about two in the morning went round the point but finding every thing as he could wish he dropt all suspicions of the Indians having hostile intentions and dwelt quite secure as the little fortification was now complete  The next day Sunday the th Tomio came running to the tents and taking Mr Banks by the arm to whom they applied in all emergent cases told him that Tubora Tumaida was dying owing to something which had been given him to eat by his people and prayed him to go instantly to him Accordingly Mr Banks went and found the Indian very sick He was told that he had been vomiting and had thrown up a leaf which they said contained some of the poison which he had taken Upon examining the leaf Mr Banks found it to be nothing more than tobacco which the Indian had begged of some of their people He looked up to Mr Banks while  he was examining the leaf as if he had not a moment to live Mr Banks now knowing his disorder ordered him to drink of cocoanut milk which soon restored him to health and he was as chearful as ever  On the st of May Captain Cook produced an iron adze made in imitation of one of their stone ones which had been brought home by Captain Wallis and shewed it to Tootahah who took such a fancy to it that notwithstanding he was offered the choice of any of the things that were in his chests he snatched it up with the greatest eagerness and would accept of nothing else The same day a Chief who had dined on board a few days before accompanied by some of his women who used to feed him came on board by himself and when dinner was on table the Captain helped him to some victuals thinking upon this occasion he would condescend to feed himself but he never attempted to eat and had not one of the servants fed him he would certainly have gone without his dinner  In the afternoon they took the astronomical quadrant with some other instruments on shore  On Tuesday the d having occasion to use the quadrant to their great astonishment and concern it was missing this was the more extraordinary as a centinel had been posted the whole night within a few yards of the tent in  which it had been deposited and it had never been taken out of the case in which it was packed Their own people were at first suspected imagining they might have mistaken the contents for articles used in traffic They searched the fort and the adjacent places and a considerable reward was offered as the loss of this instrument would have rendered it impossible for them to have made the necessary observations respecting the Transit one of the principal objects of their voyage After every fruitless search had been made Mr Banks accompanied by Mr Green and some other gentlemen set out for the woods where he thought he might gain some intelligence of the robbery if it had been committed by the natives In the course of their journey they met Tubora Tumaida with a few of the natives who was made by signs to understand that some of his countrymen had stolen the quadrant and Mr Banks insisted upon being conducted to the place where it was concealed Accordingly they proceeded together a few miles and after some enquiry Tubora Tumaida received information of the thief and that he was to be found at a place about four miles distant as they had no other arms but a brace of pistols and the spot for which they were destined was at so considerable a distance from the fort they were not without some apprehensions of danger They accordingly dispatched one of their company to  Captain Cook desiring him to forward another party after them having laid an embargo upon all the canoes in the bay a party accordingly sat out with the Captain at their head  Mr Banks and Mr Green in the interim pursued their route and at the very place which had been mentioned were met by one of Tubora Tumaida's own people with part of the quadrant soon afterwards the box in which it had been packed containing the other parts of it was recovered and upon examination though it had been taken to pieces they had the satisfaction to find it had received no material injury  In the evening when Mr Banks and the other gentlemen with Tubora Tumaida returned they were very much surprized to find Tootahah confined in the fort the gate of which was surrounded by the natives who expressed the utmost dread and anxiety on the occasion as they had no other expectation but it was intended to put him to death  Upon enquiry into this affair it appeared that the Indians were so much alarmed at Captain Cook's going up into the country with a party of armed men that in the evening most of them forsook their habitations near the fort a canoe likewise attempted to leave the bay which the Lieutenant who commanded on board the ship and had been ordered not to permit any canoe to go out perceiving dispatched  a boat to detain her but she no sooner came near them than they jumped into the sea among this unfortunate number was Tootahah who being taken up was sent by the Lieutenant to the fort and the commanding officer thought it his duty to detain him  He could not be persuaded that he was not to be put to death till Captain Cook gave orders for him to be conducted out of the fort He was received with great affection by the people every one pressing forward to embrace him  On Wednesday the d in the morning Mr Banks and Dr Solander attended as usual to purchase provisions but the Indians brought nothing to market nor could they procure any from some fishingboats which came abreast of the tents though they were in great want of cocoanuts and breadfruit Mr Banks walked into the woods and heard great complaints from the people of the ill treatment of their Chief who they said had been beaten and otherwise ill used of which Mr Banks declared he was totally ignorant The hogs which he had left as a present were sent for back by the Chief which probably he was of opinion they had illdeserved However they would not send them till he came himself by which means they thought to procure a reconciliation knowing that absence would promote that coolness between them to which the first  interview might put an end especially as they were told the Chief did not intend coming to the fort for near a fortnight  Their provisions now were extremely scarce and the markets ill supplied the people resenting the ill usage their Chief had received The next day with some difficulty Mr Banks obtained a few baskets of breadfruit from Tubora Tumaida in the woods which were a very seasonable relief An axe and shirt were sent for this day by Tootahah in return for his two hogs which they promised to bring him the next day If they had not complied with this request they could have scarcely procured any provisions  After his sending again early in the morning on Friday Mr Banks and Dr Solander with the Captain set out in the pinnace taking one of Tootahah's people with them they soon reached Eparre the place where he dwelt which was but a few miles to the west of the tents  Upon their arrival they found great numbers of people upon the shore waiting for them They were immediately conducted to the Chief whilst the people shouted round them  Taio Tootahah    "Tootahah is your friend"  they found him sitting under a tree and some old men standing round him As soon as he had made signs for them to sit down he asked for his axe which Captain Cook presented to him  with a shirt and a broad cloth garment with which he seemed greatly pleased and put the garment on After eating a mouthful together in the boat they were conducted to a large area or courtyard on one side of his house where an entertainment was provided for them consisting of wrestling The Chief sat at the upper end of the area with several of his principal men on each side of him by way of judges from whom the conquerors received applause  Ten or twelve combatants entered the area and after many simple ceremonies of challenging each other they engaged endeavouring to throw one another by dint of strength then seizing hold of each other by the thigh the hand the hair or the cloaths they grappled without the least art till one was thrown on his back this conquest was applauded by some words from the old men and three huzzas After one engagement succeeded another but if they could not throw each other during the space of a minute they parted either by consent or the intervention of their friends Several women of rank were present but it was thought they would not have attended this amusement only in compliment to the English gentlemen  A man with a stick who made way for them when they landed officiated here as master of the ceremonies keeping order among the people  When this entertainment was at an end they were informed that some hogs and a quantity of breadfruit were preparing for their dinner which intelligence was the more agreeable as their appetites were at this time exceedingly keen But instead of dining either on shore or on board of the boat they had the mortification of going as far as the ship by the desire of the Chief  As soon as the Chief was known to be on board the ship the people brought plenty of breadfruit cocoanuts and other provisions to the fort  On Monday early in the morning Mr Molineux the Master and Mr Green set out in the pinnace to the eastward in order to procure some hogs or poultry but after proceeding a considerable way and seeing many hogs and a turtle they could not purchase either They belonged to Tootahah and the people told them that they could not sell them without his consent so absolute was the power of this man  They were now obliged for the first time to bring out their nails to purchase provisions for one of the smallest size they obtained near twenty cocoanuts and some breadfruit so that they soon got great plenty  On Tuesday in the forenoon Oberea paid them a visit accompanied by her favourite  Obadee she presented them with a hog and some breadfruit  The forge being now set up and frequently at work became not only a new subject of admiration to the Indians but afforded the Captain an additional opportunity of conferring obligations on them by permitting the smith during his leisure hours to convert the old iron which they were supposed to have procured from the Dolphin into different kinds of tools  The natives after repeated attempts finding themselves incapable of pronouncing the names of the English gentlemen had recourse to new ones formed from their own language Mr Cook was named Toote Hicks Hete Gore Touara Solander Tolano Banks Opane Green Treene and so on for the greatest part of the ship's crew  As Mr Banks was sitting in his boat trading with them as usual on Friday the th a very extraordinary ceremony was performed by some ladies who were strangers to whom the rest of the Indians giving way on each side and forming a passage they advanced in procession towards Mr Banks to whom they presented some parrots feathers plantains and other plants They then brought a large bundle of cloth consisting of nine pieces which being divided into three parcels one of the women who appeared to be the principal stepping on one of the parcels pulled up all her cloaths as high as  her waist and then with an air of unaffected simplicity turned round three times This ceremony she repeated in the same manner on the other two parcels of cloth and the whole being then presented to Mr Banks the ladies went and saluted him in return for which he made them such presents as he thought would gratify them the most  The next evening Mr Banks was under the disagreeable necessity of reprimanding in very strong terms Tubora Tumaida for having the insolence to snatch his gun from him and firing it in the air a thing which surprised Mr Banks greatly as he imagined him totally ignorant of the use of it And as their safety in a great measure depended on keeping them in that state he told him with threats that his touching his piece was the greatest of insults The Indian made no reply but set off with his family to his house at Eparre He being an useful man Mr Banks accompanied by Mr Molineux thought fit to go after him and they found him among a number of people greatly dejected However as Mr Banks judiciously caused all animosity to cease they brought him back to supper after which the Chief and his wife both slept in Mr Banks's tent One of the natives not intimidated by their presence attempted that very evening to scale the walls of the fort but was prevented by the centinel These Indians  could not resist making attempts to steal the iron and iron tools within the works  Sunday morning the th divine service was performed at the fort in hopes that some of the principal Indians might be present but most of them returned home before the time However Tubora Tumaida and his wife Tomio were present they behaved with great decency but without the least apparent curiosity They made no enquiries with respect to the ceremonies and their brethren were as little inquisitive upon their return This evening several of their people were witnesses to an entertainment of a very extraordinary nature which consisted of the most indecent acts of lewdness For example a young fellow cohabited in public with a girl about eleven or twelve years of age without the least sense of shame and what is still more extraordinary Oberea with several other females of the first rank were present during the whole time  On Monday the th Mr Banks detected Tubora Tamaida in having stolen some nails Mr Banks having a good opinion of this Chief was willing to put his fidelity to the test and several temptations were thrown in his way among the rest a basket of nails which proved irresistible He confessed the fact and upon Mr Banks's insisting upon restitution he declared the nails were at Eparre this occasioned high words and at length the Indian produced  one of them He was to have been forgiven upon restoring the rest but not having resolution to fulfil his engagement he fled with his furniture and family before night  On the th one of the natives who came in the morning before daylight to steal some casks it not being the first offence the centinel snapped his gun at him but it missing fire he escaped  On Wednesday Tootahah having sent many messages to request a visit from the Captain declaring that he would acknowledge the compliment by a present of some hogs Mr Hicks the first Lieutenant was sent in hopes of getting the hogs without the visit He was received in a very friendly manner at a place called Tettehah five miles farther to the westward where Tootahah had taken up his residence He brought away one hog only which had been produced immediately upon his arrival with a promise of receiving more the next morning but when morning came he was obliged to depart without them Mr Banks on the th seeing Tubora and his wife Tomio at the tent for the first time after he stole the nails endeavoured to persuade him to restore them but in vain He was treated with great coolness during his short stay and his departure was very abrupt  On the th of May Tootahah being removed to a place called  Atahourou  Mr Banks Dr Solander Captain Cook and some others set  out in the pinnace to pay him a visit after making presents of a few trifling articles they were invited to stay the night Mr Banks having accepted of a place in Oberea's canoe left his companions in order to retire to rest Notwithstanding the care Oberea took of his cloaths by having them in her own custody they were stolen with his pistols powderhorn and many other things that were in his waistcoat pockets The alarm was given to Tootahah who slept in the next canoe and who went with Oberea in search of the thief leaving Mr Banks with only his breeches on and his musquet uncharged They soon returned but without success Mr Banks thought proper to put up with the loss for the present and a second time endeavour to sleep But he had scarce composed himself before he heard some musick and perceived lights at a small distance from shore this proved to be a concert which they call Heiva Mr Banks judged it then necessary to get up and try to find his companions As soon as he approached the lights he found the hut where Mr Cook and three of his associates lay and began to relate his melancholy tale but instead of receiving much comfort from them he was told that they had shared the same fate having lost their stockings and jackets However this did not prevent their hearing out the concert which consisted of  drums flutes and several voices after which they retired to rest  The next morning Mr Banks got his musquet from Tupia with whom he had intrusted it and some cloaths from Oberea in which he made a whimsical appearance They then got together and were joined by Dr Solander who was the only one among them that had not been robbed having slept at a house about a mile distant As to the others they were obliged to put up with their loss their cloaths c having never been heard of afterwards They set out for the boat not very well pleased carrying with them only one hog which had been intended for their supper the night before  In their return to the boat they were greatly amused by seeing some Indians swimming for their diversion amidst a surf which no European boat could have lived in or the best swimmer in Europe have saved himself from drowning had he by accident been exposed to its fury This extraordinary surf breaks upon the shore in a few places where access to the island is not guarded by a reef and makes it very dreadful and dangerous  Some Indians from a neighbouring island to which Captain Wallis gave the name of DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND informed them of more than twenty islands in the neighbourhood of Otaheite  They now began to make necessary preparations for observing the Transit of Venus and  from the hints Mr Cook had received from the Royal Society he sent out two parties to make observations from different spots that in case they failed at Otaheite they might succeed elsewhere they employed themselves in preparing their instruments and instructing such gentlemen with the use of them as were to go out And on Thursday the st of June the next Saturday being the day of the Transit they sent the long boat to Eimayo having on board Mr Gore Mr Monkhouse and Mr Sporing a friend of Mr Banks each furnished with necessary instruments by Mr Green Mr Banks and several of the Indians went out with this party Others were dispatched to find out a convenient spot at such a distance from their principal station as might suit their purpose  Those who went to Eimayo in the long boat after rowing the best part of the night by the help of some Indians aboard a canoe which they hailed found a proper situation for their Observatory upon a rock which rose out of the water about one hundred and forty yards from the shore where they fixed their tents and prepared the apparatus for the following day's observation  On Saturday the d as soon as it was light Mr Banks left them to go to the island for fresh provisions As he was trading with the natives who belonged to Tarrao the King of the island his majesty arrived with his sister whose name  was Nuna in order to pay him a visit It being customary among these people to be seated during their conferences Mr Banks spread on the ground his Indian cloth turban that he wore instead of a hat on which they all sat down After this the royal present was brought consisting of a hog and a dog some cocoanuts breadfruit c A messenger was dispatched by Mr Banks for an adze a shirt and some beads and they were presented to his majesty who received them with great pleasure Tubora Turmaida and Tomio Indians who had gone with Mr Banks upon the expedition came from the Observatory Tomio said to be related to Tarrao brought him a long nail and a shirt for Nuna by way of presents Mr Banks returned to the Observatory with Tarrao Nuna and three beautiful young women their chief attendants He shewed them the Transit of Venus over the Sun and informed them that he and his companions had come from their own country solely to view it in that situation  The produce of this island according to the inspection of Mr Banks proved to be much the same as that of Otaheite the people also resembling those of that island many of them he had seen upon it who were well acquainted with the value of the trading articles  Both the parties which were sent out made their observation with great success They nevertheless differed in the accounts of the times  M  r  Banks receiving a Visit from the King of Duke of Yorks Island  of the contacts more than might have been imagined  Mr Green's Account was as follows     Hours  Min  Sec     The first external contact or first appearance of Venus on the Sun was        Morning  The first internal contact or total immersion was        The second internal contact or beginning of the immersion        Afternoon  The second external contact or total immersion        Latitude of the Observatory ° ′ ″              Longitude ° ′ ″ W of Greenwich              While they were viewing the Transit of Venus some of the ship's company broke into one of the storerooms and stole a quantity of spikenails As the circulation of these nails might have been greatly detrimental to them strict search was made and one of the thieves was detected He had only a few in his custody but was however punished with two dozen lashes  The death of an old woman of some distinction gave them an opportunity of observing the manner of the Indians disposing of their dead whom they never bury The kind of bier on which the corpse is deposited has already  been described and the breadfruit c placed as before which Tubora Tumaida informed Mr Banks was deposited as an offering to their Gods A sort of stile was placed in the front of the square where the relations of the deceased stood to testify their sorrow beneath the awning were several pieces of cloth on which were the tears and blood of the mourners for upon these occasions they wound themselves with a shark's tooth At a small distance two temporary houses were erected in one of which some of the relations of the deceased constantly remained and in the other the chief mourner resided who was dressed in a peculiar manner to perform a particular ceremony After the corpse is rotten the bones are buried near the spot It was afterwards discovered that these repositories of the dead were used also for religious worship  There having been a scarcity of breadfruit for some days an enquiry was made of the cause and the reasons the Indians gave was that there being a great crop the fruit had been gathered to make a sort of sour paste which the natives call  Mabie  which after fermentation will keep a long time and supply them in times of dearth  The funeral ceremony in honour of the old woman was performed on the th by the chief mourner and Mr Banks was so desirous to be a spectator that he agreed to take a part  in the performance of this ceremony being informed that he could not be present on any other condition He accordingly went in the evening to the place where the body was deposited there he was met by the relations of the deceased and afterwards joined by several other persons The chief mourner was Tubora Tumaida his dress was whimsical though not altogether ungrateful Mr Banks was obliged to quit his European dress and he had no other covering than a small piece of cloth which was tied round his middle his body was then blacked with charcoal and water as were the bodies of several others particularly some females who were as little covered as himself the procession then began The chief mourner uttered some words that were judged to be a prayer when he approached the body and he repeated it as he came up to his own house After this the procession went on by permission towards the fort It is usual for the Indians to shun these processions as much as possible they accordingly ran into the woods in great haste as soon at it came in view From the fort it proceeded along the shore Having crossed the river it entered the woods passing several houses which became immediately uninhabited and during the rest of the procession which continued above half an hour not a single Indian was visible Mr Banks filled an office they called  Nineveh  and there  were two others in the same character When none of the other natives were to be seen they approached the chief mourner saying  imatata  then those who had assisted at the ceremony bathed in the river and resumed their customary dress  Such was this uncommon ceremony in which Mr Banks performed a capital part and met with the applause of Tubora Tumaida the chief mourner  Complaint was made on Monday the th to the Captain that the Indians had lost some bows and arrows and strings of plaited hair the affair was enquired into and the fact being well attested two dozen lashes were inflicted upon each of the criminals  The bows and arrows of the Indians have not hitherto been noticed but this day Tubora Tumaida brought his hither occasioned by a challenge he had received from Mr Gore The Indian Chief imagined it was a trial of skill who could shoot the farthest but Mr Gore proposed shooting at a mark The mistake being soon discovered the champions declined the trial The Indian however to display his skill drew his bow and sent an arrow unfeathered as they all were nearly the sixth part of a mile They shoot kneeling and drop the bow the instant the arrow is discharged  In this morning's excursion Mr Banks met several of the natives who were itinerant musicians  and the place of the evening's rendezvous being known all the English gentlemen went thither to partake of the diversion Their instruments were flutes and drums and a great number of the Indians were got together upon the occasion The drummers sung to the music and to the astonishment of Mr Banks and the rest of his companions they found that they were the chief subject of the minstrels lays These songs must therefore have been extemporaneous the rewards whereof were such necessaries as they required  An iron coal rake for the oven being stole in the night of the th and many other things having at different times been taken by the Indians the Captain judged it of some consequence if possible to put an end to these practices by making it their common interest to prevent it He had already given strict orders that the centinels should not fire upon them even if they were detected in the fact About twentyseven of their double canoes with sails were just come in with cargoes of fish which the Captain seized and then gave notice that unless the rake and all the other things which had at different times been stolen were returned the vessels should be burnt The Captain had indeed no such design as will appear by the event The menace produced no other effect than the restitution of the rake all the other things remaining in their possession  at length the Captain thought proper to give up the cargoes as the innocent natives were in great distress for want of them and at last to prevent confusion from the difficulty of ascertaining to whom the different lots belonged he promised also to release the canoes  About this time another event had nearly involved the English in a quarrel with the Indians The Captain having sent a boat on shore to get ballast the officer not meeting immediately with what he wanted began to pull down one of their sepulchral buildings this measure was strenuously opposed by the Indians Mr Banks having received intelligence of the affair repaired to the spot and the matter was soon amicably terminated there being stones sufficient found elsewhere This was the only opposition they had hitherto made and the only personal insult received besides the affair of the musket at the tent for which the Indian forfeited his life was by Mr Monkhouse who having pulled a flower within one of their burial inclosures was struck by an Indian the gentleman laid hold of him but he was rescued by two more who pulling Mr Monkhouse's hair forced him to quit his hold after which they all ran off  On the th in the evening soon after dark while the canoes were detained by the Captain Oberea the Queen and several of her attendants paid the gentlemen a visit she came from Tootahah's palace in a double canoe and  brought with her a hog breadfruit and other presents among which was a dog but none of the things that had been stolen those she pleaded had been taken away by her gallant Obadee for which she had beaten him She did not however seem to think her story deserved credit but appeared at first much terrified though she surmounted her fears with great fortitude and was desirous of sleeping with her attendants in Mr Bank's tent but this being refused she was obliged to pass the night in her canoe The Captain declined accepting of her presents at which she seemed very sorrowful Mr Banks and the rest of the gentlemen retired to bed and a whole tribe of the Indians would have slept in the belltent but were not permitted  The next morning the Queen returned to the fort and Captain Cook having altered his mind accepted of her presents Two of her attendants were very earnest in getting themselves husbands in which they succeeded by means of the Surgeon and one of the Lieutenants they seemed very agreeable till bedtime and determined to lie in Mr Banks's tent which they accordingly did till the Surgeon having some words with one of them Mr Banks thrust her out and she was followed by the rest except Otea Tea who cried for some time till he turned her out also This had like to have become a serious affair a duel being talked of between Mr Banks and Mr Monkhouse but it was happily  avoided Dogs are esteemed here more delicate eating than pork as those bread to be eaten taste no animal food but live entirely upon vegetables and the experiment was tried Tupia undertook to kill and dress him which he did by making a hole in the ground and baking him It was agreed by every one to be a very good dish  They were visited on the st at the fort by many of the natives who brought various kinds of presents and among the rest Oamo a Chief of several districts on the island whom they had never before seen who brought with him a hog This Chief was treated with great respect by the natives and was accompanied by a boy and a young woman The boy was carried upon a man's back though he was very able to walk Oberea and some other of the Indians went out of the fort to meet them their heads and bodies being first uncovered as low as the waist This was considered as a mark of respect they had not noticed it before but judged it was usually shewn to persons of distinguished rank among them Oamo entered the tent but the young woman who was about sixteen could not be prevailed upon to accompany him tho' she seemed to combat with her curiosity and inclination Dr Solander took the youth by the hand and conducted him in but the natives without who had prevented the girl's entrance soon found means to get him out again  The curiosity of Mr Banks and the other gentlemen being excited from these circumstances they made enquiry who these strangers were and were informed that Oamo was Oberea's husband but that by mutual consent they had been for a considerable time separated and that the youth and girl were their offspring The boy was named  Terridiri  and was heir apparent to the sovereignty of the island and he was to espouse his sister as soon as he had attained the proper age The present sovereign being a minor called OUTOU and son of Whappai Whappai Oamo and Tootahah were all brothers Whappai was the senior and Oamo the next wherefore Whappai having no child but Outou Terridiri son of Oamo was heir to the sovereignty To us it will appear singular that a boy should reign during the life of his father but in the island of Otaheite a boy succeeds to his father's authority and title as soon as he is born when a regent is elected which office usually falls upon the father till the boy becomes of age at this time however the election had fallen upon his uncle Tootahah on account of his warlike exploits Oamo was very inquisitive with respect to the English and by his questions he appeared a man of understanding and penetration  A woman called Teetee who came from the west of the island presented to the Captain an elegant garment of a bright yellow ground  bordered with red and in the middle of it were several crosses which they had probably learned from the French  On the d in the morning one of their hands being missing they enquired for him among the natives and were told that he was at Eparre Tootahah's residence in the wood and one of the Indians offered to fetch him back which he did that evening On his return he informed them that he had been taken from the fort and carried to the top of the bay by three men who having stripped him forced him into a canoe and conducted him to Eparre where he received some cloaths from Tootahah who endeavoured to prevail on him to continue there They had great reason to suppose this account true for the natives were no sooner acquainted with his return than they left the fort with much precipitation  Monday June early in the morning the Captain set out in the pinnace accompanied by Mr Banks to circumnavigate the island They sailed to the eastward and in the forenoon they went on shore in a part of the island under the government of Ahio a young Chief who had often visited them at the tents They also found here some other natives of their acquaintance They then proceeded together to the harbour wherein M Bougainville lay when he visited this island and were shewn the ground on which he fixed his tent and the wateringplace  They also met with  Orette  a Chief who was their particular friend whose brother went away with M Bougainville  Having taken a survey of this harbour and a large bay near which it is situated they proposed going to the opposite side of the bay but Titubaola who was their conductor not only refused to accompany them but endeavoured to dissuade the Captain and Mr Banks from going saying  "That country was inhabited by people who were not subjects to Tootahah and who would destroy them all"  This information did not however prevent the execution of their design and upon loading their pieces with ball Titubaola took courage to go with them they rowed till it was dark when they reached a narrow neck of land that divided the island into two peninsulas which are distinct governments As they were not yet got into the hostile part of the country they agreed to spend the night on shore where they were provided with supper and lodging by Ooratooa the lady who paid her compliments to Mr Banks in so remarkable a manner at the fort  In the morning they pursued their passage for the other government  They landed in a district which was governed by a Chief named MARAITATA the  burying place of men  and his father was called PAHAIREDE the  stealer of boats  Notwithstanding  their names were so ominous they gave the Captain and Mr Banks a very civil reception furnished them with provisions and sold them a large hog for a hatchet The curiosity of the natives was soon excited and a crowd gathered round the English gentlemen but they saw only two people whom they knew neither did they observe any trinkets that had come out of the Endeavour though they met with several European commodities particularly two twelve pound shot one of which had the English broad arrow upon it though the Indians said they had them from M Bougainville's people They then advanced till they reached the district which was under the dominion of the principal Chief or King named  Waheatua  who had a son but it was not known in whose hands the sovereign power was lodged Here they found a spacious verdant plain watered by a river of so great a width that they were obliged to pass it in a canoe but their Indian followers swam over it with the greatest facility There was no house that appeared inhabited but the ruins of several large ones Having continued their journey along the shore for a considerable way they at last saw the Chief and with him an agreeable young woman about two and twenty named Toudidde They were not unacquainted with her name as they had often heard it mentioned by the natives and they had great reason to suppose she was the Queen of this peninsula  In passing through this part of the island they found it better cultivated and more improved than any they had hitherto met with though the houses were but few and those very small but there were a great number of canoes which excelled any they had seen both in size and workmanship The burial places were likewise numerous being found not only at every point but at different places in the interior parts of the island These buildings nearly resembled in form those which they had seen at Opouroenu but they were neater and adorned with carvings of various figures in one there was a cock which was painted in imitation of the natural colour of the feathers of that bird Notwithstanding the fertility of the country and its being well cultivated scarce any breadfruit was to be met with and the inhabitants subsisted chiefly upon a nut called  ahee    Finding themselves fatigued they now took to their boat and in the evening landed on an island named Otooareite being in want of some refreshment Mr Banks went into the woods to try what he could obtain but it being dark he met with no inhabitants and but one house in which he found only a breadfruit and a few of the nuts beforementioned nor were they more successful in procuring provisions the next morning  Towards the southermost part of the island they found a good harbour formed by a reef  and the circumjacent country is remarkably fruitful At about three miles distant they landed at a place where they found several of the natives with whom they were intimately acquainted After having with a good deal of difficulty obtained some cocoanuts they again embarked  They landed again a little further to the east Mathiabo the Chief with whom they had no acquaintance nor had ever seen before soon came to them and supplied them with cocoanuts and bread fruit They also purchased a hog of him for a glass bottle which he took in preference to every other thing that was offered him They saw here a turkey cock and a goose which the Dolphin left on the island they were remarkably fat and seemed to be greatly admired by the Indians  A very uncommon sight presented itself in a house near this place several human jawbones were fastened to a board of a semicircular form they seemed fresh and had not lost any of their teeth but Mr Banks could obtain no explanation of this mystery Upon their quitting the place the Chief accompanied them and piloted them over the shoals They opened the bay in the evening on the northwest side of the island which corresponded with that on the southeast in such a manner as to intersect the island at the isthmus  Several canoes came off here with some very beautiful women who appeared to be desirous of their going on shore to which they readily assented They met with a very friendly reception from the Chief whose name was Wiverou who gave directions to some of his people to assist them in dressing their provisions which were now very plentiful and they supped at Wiverou's house in company with Mathiabo Part of the house was allotted for them to sleep in and soon after supper they retired to rest Mathiabo having obtained a cloak from Mr Banks under pretence of using it as a coverlet when he lay down immediately made off with it unperceived by that gentleman or his companions News however of the robbery was soon brought them by one of the natives in consequence of which intelligence they sat out in pursuit of the thief but had proceeded a very little way before they were met by a person bringing back the cloak which Mathiabo had given up through fear  The house upon their return was entirely deserted and about four in the morning the centinel gave the alarm that the boat was missing Mr Banks and the Captain were greatly astonished at this account and ran to the waterside but though the morning was clear and starlight no boat was visible Their situation was now extremely terrifying the party consisting of but four with a single musket and two  pocket pistols without a spare ball or a charge of powder After remaining in this distressful state of anxiety for a considerable time dreading the advantage the Indians would take of it to their great joy the boat which had been driven away by the tide returned Mr Banks and his companions no sooner breakfasted than they departed This place is situated on the north side of Tiarrabou the southeast peninsula of the island about five miles east from the isthmus with a harbour equal to any in the island It was fertile and populous and the inhabitants every where behaved with civility The last district in Tiarrabou in which they landed was governed by a Chief named OMOE He was building a house and was very desirous of purchasing a hatchet but Mr Banks and the Captain had not one left He would not trade for nails and they embarked the Chief following them in a canoe with his wife in hopes of obtaining something useful to him The Chief and his wife were afterwards taken on board and after having gone about three miles they desired to be put on shore and their request was complied with when the Captain met with some of Omoe's people who had brought with them a very large hog The Chief agreed to exchange the hog for a large axe and a nail and to bring the beast to the fort in Port Royal Bay This resolution he came to after consulting with his wife  and Mr Banks judged the exchange to be very advantageous to the English as the hog was a remarkable fine one  At this place they saw one of their Eatuas or Gods it was made of wickerwork and resembled the figure of a man it was near seven feet in height and was covered with black and white feathers on the head were four protuberances which the natives called  Tate ete  or little men  Having taken their leave of Omoe they sat out on their return after rowing a few miles they went on shore again but saw nothing remarkable except a sepulchral building which was ornamented in an extraordinary manner The pavement on which was built a pyramid was very neat at a little distance there was an image of stone very uncouthly carved which the natives seemed to hold in a great estimation  They passed through the harbour which was the only one fit for shipping on the south of Opoureonu situated about five miles to the westward of the isthmus between two small islands not far from shore and within a mile of each other They were now near the district named Paparra which was governed by Oamo and Oberea where they intended to spend the night Mr Banks and his company landed about an hour before it was dark and found that they were both set out to pay them a visit at the fort They nevertheless slept at the house  of Oberea which though not large was very neat no inhabitant but her father was now in possession of it who shewed them much civility They took this opportunity of walking out to a point upon which they had observed at a distance some trees called Etoa which usually grow on the burialplaces of these people They call these buryinggrounds Morai which are also places of worship They here saw an immense edifice which they found to be the Morai of Oamo and Oberea which was by far the most considerable piece of architecture to be found in the island  It consisted of an enormous pile of stone work raised in the form of a pyramid with a flight of steps on each side something after the manner of those little buildings which are commonly erected in England to place the pillars of sun dials upon it was near two hundred and seventy feet long and about onethird as wide and between forty and fifty feet high  The foundation consisted of rockstones the steps of coral and the upper part of round pebbles all of the same shape and size the rock and coral stones were squared with the utmost neatness and regularity and the whole building appeared as compact and firm as if it had been erected by the best workmen in Europe As the Indians were totally destitute of iron utensils to shape their stones as well as mortar to cement them when they had made  A Morai or Burial Place  them fit for use a structure of such heighth and magnitude must have been a work of infinite labour and fatigue  In the center of the summit was the representation of a bird carved in wood close to this was the figure of a fish which was in stone This pyramid made part of one side of a wide court or square the sides of which were nearly equal the whole was walled in and paved with flat stones Within this place grew notwithstanding it was in this manner paved several plantains and trees which the natives call Etoa At a little distance to the west of this edifice was another paved square which contained several small stages called by the natives Ewattas which appeared to be altars upon them they place provisions as sacrifices to their gods Mr Banks afterwards observed whole hogs placed upon these ewattas or altars  The inhabitants of the island of Otaheite seem in nothing so desirous of excelling each other as in the grandeur and magnificence of their sepulchres and the rank and authority of Oberea was forcibly evinced upon this occasion The gentlemen of the Endeavour it has been observed did not find Oberea possessed of the same power as when the Dolphin was at this place and they were now informed of the cause The way from her house to the Morai was by the seaside and they observed in all places as they passed along a great number of  human bones Inquiry being made into the cause of this extraordinary sight they were informed that about four or five months before Captain Cook's arrival the inhabitants of Tiarrabou the peninsula to the southeast made a descent here and slew many of the people whose bones were those that were seen upon the coast that hereupon Oberea and Oamo who then held the government for his son had fled and taken refuge in the mountains and that the victors destroyed all the houses and pillaged the country Mr Banks was also informed that the turkey and goose which he had seen in the district of Mathiabo were among the booty this afforded a reason for their being found where the Dolphin had little or no correspondence and the jawbones being mentioned which had been seen hanging in a house he was informed that they had likewise been carried off as trophies The jawbones of their enemies being considered by the natives of this island as great a mark of triumph as scalps are by the Indians of North America  On Friday the th they arrived at Otahourou where their old acquaintance Tootahah resided he received them with great civility and provided for them a good supper and a convenient lodging and notwithstanding they were so shamefully plundered the last time they slept with this chief They spent the night in  the utmost security none of their cloaths or any other article being missing in the morning  On Saturday July they returned to the fort at Fort Royal Harbour having discovered the island both peninsulas included to be about one hundred miles in circumference They were now very much in want of breadfruit owing to the scarcity of the season and could obtain but a very small quantity upon their whole tour  Their Indian friends crouded about them upon their return and none of them came without provisions  Monday the d Mr Banks made an excursion with some Indian guides to trace the river up the valley to its source and observe to what extent its banks were inhabited After meeting with houses for the space of six miles they came up to one which was said to be the last that could be seen The master of it presented them with cocoanuts and other fruits and after a short visit they continued their walk In this tour they often passed under vaults formed by rocky fragments in which they were informed that those who were benighted often took refuge They pursued the course of the river for about five or six miles further and found it banked on both sides by rocks which were almost perpendicular and near one hundred feet high notwithstanding which a way was to be traced up these dreadful precipices  and their Indian guides offered to conduct them by this path to the summit but as it could not be effected without the utmost difficulty and danger and there appeared nothing at the top to recompence them for the fatigue and hazard of the undertaking they declined attemping it  Mr Banks during this tour had a fine opportunity of searching for minerals among the rocks which were almost on all sides naked he found however not the smallest appearance of any kind of mineral The stones every where resembling those of Madeira gave manifest signs of having been burnt Scarce a single stone was found during their whole stay upon the island which had not unquestionable marks of fire on it except the hatchetstone and some of these were not entirely free from it There are also evident traces of fire in the clay upon the hills both of this and the neighbouring islands  Mr Banks was engaged the th in planting on each side of the fort a great quantity of the seeds of watermelons oranges lemons limes and other plants and trees which he had brought from Rio de Janeiro He gave of these seeds to the Indians in great plenty and planted many of them in the  oods some of the melonseeds which had been planted soon after his arrival had already produced plants which appeared to be in a very flourishing state  They now began to make preparations for their departure but before they set sail they had another visit from Oamo Oberea and their son and daughter The young woman whose name they understood to be  Toimata  was very curious to see the fort but Oamo would by no means permit her to come in The son of Waheatua sovereign of Tiarrabou or the southeast peninsula was also here at this time and they received intelligence of the arrival of another guest whose company they neither wished for nor expected this was the Indian who had stolen the quadrant  On Friday the th the carpenters were ordered to take down the gates and pallisadoes of the fort to be converted into firewood on board the Endeavour and one of the Indians stole the staple and hook belonging to the gate he was instantly pursued but could not be found and soon after this their old friend Tubora Tumaida brought back the staple  They continued on the th and th to pull down the fort and their friends still visited them  Captain Cook hoped now to quit the island without any farther misunderstanding with the natives but in this he was mistaken Two foreign sailors having been out one of them was robbed of his knife and striving to recover it the Indians attacked and wounded him in a dangerous manner with a stone his companion also received a slight wound in the head  As Captain Cook would have been unwilling to have taken farther notice of the transaction he was not sorry that the offenders had made their escape Another affair equally disagreeable soon after happened Between the th and th in the evening two young marines retired secretly from the fort and in the morning were not to be met with Notice having been given for all the company to go on board the next day and that the ship would sail that day or the day ensuing Captain Cook began to fear that the marines intended to remain on shore He was apprised that no effectual steps could be taken to recover them without risking the harmony and good fellowship which at present subsisted between the English and the natives and therefore resolved to wait a day in hopes of their returning  The th in the morning the marines not being returned an enquiry was made after them when the Indians declared they did not propose returning having taken refuge in the mountains where it was impossible to discover them and that each had taken a wife In consequence of which it was intimated to several of the Chiefs who were in the fort with their women among whom were Tubora Tumaida Tomio and Oberea that they would not be suffered to quit it till the deserters were produced Captain Cook thought this precaution necessary as by concealing them a short time he might be compelled  to go without them they received the intimation with very little signs either of fear or discontent assuring the Captain that the marines should be sent back In the interim he sent Mr Hicks in the pinnace to bring Tootahah on board the ship which he executed without giving any alarm Night coming on Captain Cook judged it was not prudent to let the people whom he had detained as hostages remain at the fort and he therefore ordered Tubora Tumaida Oberea and some others to be brought on board This gave an unusual alarm and several of them especially the females testified their apprehensions with great agitation of mind and floods of tears when they were coming on board Captain Cook went on board with them Mr Banks remaining on shore with some others whom he thought it of less importance to detain  One of the marines was brought back in the evening by some of the Indians who reported that the other and the two people who were sent to fetch them back would be detained whilst Tootahah was confined Mr Hicks was immediately dispatched in the longboat with several men to rescue the English prisoners at the same time Captain Cook told Tootahah that it was incumbent on him to assist them with some of his people and to give orders in his name that the men should be set at liberty for that he should expect him to answer for the  event Tootahah immediately complied and this party recovered the men without any opposition About seven in the morning on the th they returned but without the arms which had been taken from them when they were made prisoners the arms were however brought on board soon after and the Chiefs were allowed to return on shore  At the time the Chiefs were set on shore from the ship those at the fort were also released and after remaining with Mr Banks about an hour and a half they all returned to their respective places of residence When the deserters were examined it was discovered that the account which the Indians had given was no way false they had become fond of two girls and it was their design to keep themselves concealed till the ship had set sail and continue upon the island  Tupia whose name has been often mentioned in this voyage had been prime minister of Oberea when she was at the pinnacle of her authority he was also the principal priest of the island and therefore intimately acquainted with the religion of the country He was likewise deeply versed in navigation and was thoroughly acquainted with the number situation inhabitants and produce of the adjacent islands He had often testified a desire to go with them and on Wednesday the th in the morning he came on board with a boy about twelve  years of age his servant named Taiyota and requested the gentlemen on board to let him go with them As it was thought he would be useful to them in many particulars they unanimously agreed to comply with his request Tupia then went ashore for the last time to see his friends and took with him several baubles to give them as parting tokens of remembrance  Mr Banks being willing to obtain a drawing of the Morai in possession of Tootahah at Eparre Captain Cook accompanied him thither in the pinnace together with Dr Solander They immediately upon landing repaired to Tootahah's house where they were met by Oberea and several others A general good understanding prevailed and they promised to visit the gentlemen early the next day to take leave of them as they were told that the ship would then set sail There also they met Tupia who came back with them and slept for the first time on board the ship  Thursday the th of July the ship was visited by a multitude of the gentlemen's friends and surrounded by numberless canoes which contained the inferior natives They weighed anchor about twelve and the Indians took their leaves of the gentlemen on board weeping in a friendly and affecting manner Tupia supported himself in this scene with a becoming fortitude tears flowed from his eyes its true  but the effort that he made to conceal them did him additional honour He went with Mr Banks to the mast head where he continued waving his hand to the canoes as long as they remained visible  The longitude of Port Royal Bay as settled by Captain Wallis was found to be within half a degree of its real situation Point Venus the northern extremity of the island and the eastern point of the bay lies in the longitude degrees minutes Port Royal Bay which is equal to any in Otaheite may easily be discovered by a remarkable high mountain in the center of the island bearing due south from Point Venus The shore of the bay is a fine sandy beach behind which runs a river of fresh water any number of ships may water here without any inconvenience to each other The only wood for firing upon the whole island is that of fruittrees which must be purchased of the natives or it is impossible to live upon good terms with them  According to Tupia's account the island could furnish above six thousand fighting men whereby a computation of the number of inhabitants may easily be made  The produce of Otaheite is breadfruit cocoanuts bananas plantains a fruit not unlike an apple potatoes yams cocoas sugarcane and a variety of other fruits and vegetables  They have no European fruits garden stuff or pulse nor grain of any species Their tame animals are hogs dogs and poultry there is not a wild animal in the island except ducks pigeons parroquets and a few other birds rats being the only quadruped and there are no serpents The sea however supplies them with great variety of excellent fish  With regard to the people they are in general rather of a larger make than Europeans The males are tall robust and finely shaped The females of the superior class are likewise generally above our common size but those of the lower rank are rather below it and some of them are remarkably little  Their natural complexion is a fine clear olive or what we call  brunette  their skin is delicately smooth and agreeably soft The shape of their faces is in general handsome and their eyes are full of sensibility and expression their teeth are likewise remarkably white and regular and their breath intirely free from any disagreeable smell their hair is for the most part black The men unlike the original inhabitants of America have long beards which they wear in various forms and what is very remarkable circumcision is almost universally practised among them from a motive of cleanliness having a peculiar term of reproach with which they upbraid those who do not adopt this custom Both sexes always eradicate the  hair from their armpits and they often reproached the English gentlemen with a want of cleanliness for not making use of the same method Their motions are easy and graceful but not vigorous their deportment is generous and open and their behaviour affable and courteous They appeared of a brave noble and candid disposition equally strangers to the base and unworthy passions of cruelty treachery or revenge and setting aside their violent prepensity to thieving it may fairly be said that their general characters would lose nothing in the comparison with those of the most civilized nation under the globe  Contrary to the custom of almost all other countries the women of this island cut their hair quite short whereas the men wear it long sometimes hanging loose on their shoulders and at others tied in a knot on the crown of their heads in which they stick the feathers of birds of various colours  Both sexes frequently wear a piece of cloth of the manufacture of the island tied round their heads in the form of a turban and the women take no little pains in plaiting human hair into long strings which being folded into branches are tied on their foreheads by way of ornament  Th  re is a custom likewise prevalent among th  m  f anointing their heads with an oil extracted from the cocoanut The smell of  which is not altogether agreeable as the climate is hot and they are not provided with any thing similar to a comb their heads are not clear from vermin it evidently appeared however to be more the effect of necessity than inclination as those to whom they gave combs immediately got rid of these disagreeable companions  They stain their bodies by indenting or pricking the flesh with a small instrument made of bone cut into short teeth which indentures they fill with a dark blue or blackish mixture prepared from the smoke or an oily nut burnt by them instead of candles and water this operation which is called by the natives Tattaowing is exceedingly painful and leaves an indelible mark on the skin It is usually performed when they are about ten or twelve years of age and on different parts of the body but those which suffer most severely are the breech and the loins which are marked with arches carried one above another a considerable way up their backs  At the operation of  Tattaowing  performed upon the posteriors of a girl about twelve years of age Mr Banks was present it was executed with an instrument that had twenty teeth and at each stroke which was repeated every moment serum mixed with blood issued She bore it with great resolution for several minutes but at length the pain became so violent  that she murmured and complained and then burst into the most violent lamentations but her operator was inexorable whilst some females present chid and even beat her Mr Banks was a spectator for near an hour during which time it was performed only on one side the other having undergone the ceremony sometime before and the arches upon the loins which are the most painful but upon which they the most pique themselves were yet to be made  They cloath themselves in cloth and matting of various kinds the first they wear in fair the latter in wet weather They are in different forms no shape being preserved in them nor are the pieces sewed together The women of a superior class wear three or four pieces one which is of considerable length they wrap several times round their waists and it falls down to the middle of the leg Two or three other short pieces with a hole cut in the middle of each are placed on one another and their heads coming through the holes the long ends hang before and behind both sides being open by which means they have the free use of their arms  The mens dress is very similar differing only in one instance which is that part of the garment instead of falling below the knees is brought between the legs This dress is worn by all ranks of people the only distinction being quantity in  A Woman Boy of the new discoverd Islands in the Dress of the Country  the superior class At noon both sexes appear almost naked wearing only the piece of cloth that is tied round the waist Their faces are shaded from the sun with small bonnets made of cocoanut leaves or matting which are constructed in a few minutes The men sometimes wear a sort of wig made of human or dogs hair or of cocoanut strings woven on a single thread which is fastened under their hair and hangs down behind Both men and women wear earrings on one side consisting of shells stones berries or small pearls but they soon gave the perference to the beads brought by the Endeavour's company  The boys and girls go quite naked the first till they are seven or eight years old the latter till they are about five Their houses which have been described already they seldom use but to sleep in or to avoid the rain as they eat in the open air under the shade of a tree Their clothes serve them at night for covering and there are no divisions or apartments The master and his wife repose in the middle then the married people next to these the unmarried females and at a small distance the men who are unmarried and the servants sleep in the open air in fair weather The houses of the Chiefs however differ in some degree there are some very small and so built as to be carried in canoes all sides of them are inclosed with the leaves of the cocoanut the air nevertheless  penetrates in these the Chief and his wife alone sleep There are also houses which are general receptacles for the inhabitants of a district These are much larger many being more than two hundred feet in length forty in breadth and seventy or eighty feet high They are constructed at the common expence and have an area on one side surrounded with low pallisades but like the others have no walls  When a Chief kills a hog which is but seldom he divides it equally among his vassals dogs and fowls are more common  When the breadfruit in not in season they are supplied by cocoanuts bananas plantains c  Their cookery consists chiefly of baking the manner of doing which has been already described They bake their breadfruit in the same way which renders it something like a mealy potatoe of this fruit three dishes are made by beating it to a paste and mixing it with bananas plantains or the sour paste which the natives nominate  Mahie    This paste is made by taking breadfruit which is not thoroughly ripe and laying it in heaps covered with leaves by which means it ferments the core is then taken out and the fruit put into a hole lined with grass it is then again covered with leaves upon which large stones are placed this produces a second fermentation after which it grows sour and undergoes  no change for a long time they take it from this hole as they have occasion for it and making it into balls it is rolled up in plantainleaves and baked as it will keep for some weeks after it is dressed they eat it both hot and cold  Such is the food of these people their sauce to which never consists of any thing but salt water As to their drink it is generally confined to water or the milk of the cocoa nuts though there were instances in which some of them drank so freely of the English liquors as to become quite intoxicated this however seemed to proceed more from ignorance than design as they were never known to repeat a debauch of this kind a second time They were told indeed that the Chiefs sometimes became inebriated by drinking the juice of a plant called  Ava  but of this they saw no instance during the time they remained on the island  The Chiefs generally eat alone unless when visited by a stranger who is sometimes permitted to become a second in their mess having nothing to supply the want of a table they sit on the ground in the shade leaves of trees being spread before them serve as a tablecloth their attendants who are numerous having placed a basket by the Chiefs containing their provisions and a cocoanut shell of fresh and salt water seat themselves round them they then begin by washing their mouth and hands after  which they eat a mouthful of breadfruit and fish dipt in salt water alternately till the whole is consumed taking a sup of salt water likewise between almost every morsel The breadfruit and fish being all eaten they next have either plantains or apples which they never eat without being pared During this time a soft paste is prepared from the breadfruit which they sup out of a cocoanut shell this finishes the meal and the hands and mouth are again washed as at the beginning  It is astonishing how much food they eat at a meal Mr Banks and some other gentlemen were present when one man devoured three fish the size of a middling carp four bread fruits as large as a common melon thirteen or fourteen plantains seven or eight inches long and above half as big round and about a quart of the paste made of breadfruit  It is not a little surprizing that the inhabitants of this island who seemed exceedingly sensible of the pleasures of society should have an universal aversion to the least intercourse with each other at their meals and so rigid are they in the observance of this unusual custom that even brothers and sisters have their separate baskets to contain their provisions and generally sit some yards distance when they eat with their backs turned towards each other not exchanging a single word during the whole time of their repast the middle aged of superior  rank usually betake themselves to sleep after dinner but what is remarkable the older people are not so lazy music dancing wrestling and shooting with the bow or throwing a lance constitute a chief part part of their diversions  Flutes which have been mentioned before and drums are the only musical instruments among them their drums are formed of a circular piece of wood hollow at one end only which is covered with the skin of a shark and they are beaten with the hand instead of a stick Their songs are extempore and frequently in rhime but consist of only two lines these couplets are often sung by way of evening amusements between sunset and bedtime during which time they are not destitute of lights having candles which they make of an oily nut fixing them one above another upon a small stick run through the middle some of these candles burn a long time and afford a pretty good light  Among their other amusements they have a dance named  Timorodee  which is performed by ten or a dozen young females who put themselves into the most wanton attitudes that can possibly be imagined keeping time during the performance with the greatest nicety and exactness from these dances the women are immediately excluded on their becoming pregnant  Many of the principal people of this island of each sex have united into an association in which no woman confines her favours to any  particular man in this manner they obtain a perpetual variety no one object ever gratifying them but a few days  These societies are named  Arreoy  the members of which have meetings where the men amuse themselves by wrestling and notwithstanding the frequent intercourse which the women have with a variety of men they dance the  Timorodee  in such a manner as they imagine will most excite the desires of the male sex and which are often gratified upon the spot There are yet much worse practices In case any of the women prove with child which in this manner of life seldom happens they destroy the helpless infant as soon as it is brought into the world that it may not be a burden to the father nor interrupt the mother in the pursuit of her lascivious amusements Natural affection however for the child sometimes happily produces a reformation in the mother but when this happens the child's life is always forfeited unless the mother can procure a man to adopt it as his child in which case this inhuman murder is prevented but both the man and woman are for ever expelled this society The woman being particularized by the appellation of  Whannownow    "bearer of children"  which among these people is considered as a term of the greatest reproach  Their personal cleanliness is an object that merits peculiar attention Both sexes never  omit to wash with water three times a day when they rise at noon and before they go to rest They also keep their cloaths extremely clean so that in the largest communities no disagreeable effluvia ever arises nor is there any other inconvenience than heat  The chief manufacture of Otaheite is cloth of this cloth there are three different sorts which are made of the bark of as many different trees viz the mulberry the breadfruit and a tree not very unlike the wild figtree which is found in some parts of the West Indies The mulberrytree which the Indians call  Aouta  produces the finest cloth which is seldom worn but by those of the first rank The next sort which is worn by the lower class of people is made of the breadfruit tree and the coarsest of the tree resembling the figtree This last sort though more useful than the two former on account of its keeping cut water which neither of the others will is exceedingly scarce being manufactured but in small quantities  The same method is used in manufacturing these three cloths notwithstanding they are all different a description therefore of their manner of making one will suffice for the whole  Having stript off the bark of the trees it is soaked in water for two or three days they then take it out and separate the inner bark from the external coat by scraping it with a shell after which it is spread out on plantainleaves placing  two or three layers one over another and taking care to make it of an equal thickness in every part it continues in this state till it is nearly dry when it adheres together so firmly that it may be taken from the ground without breaking After this process it is laid on a smooth board and beaten with an instrument made for that purpose of a compact heavy wood called by the natives  Etoa  This instrument is about fourteen inches long and seven in circumference it is of a quadrangular shape and each of the four sides is marked with longitudinal grooves or furrows differing in this instance that there is a regular gradation in the width and depth of the grooves on each of the sides the coarser side containing not more than ten of these furrows and the finest above sixty  They begin to beat their cloth with that side of the mallet where the grooves are deepest and widest and proceeding regularly with the others finish with that which has the greatest number by this beating it is extended in a manner similar to the gold which is formed into leaves by the hammer and is marked with an appearance of little channels not unlike those which are visible on paper but rather deeper it is in general beat very thin and when they want it thicker than common they take two or three pieces and paste them together with a kind of glue prepared from a root called  Pea    This cloth becomes exceedingly white by bleaching and is died of a red yellow brown or black colour the first of which is exceedingly beautiful and equal if not superior to any in Europe They make this red colour from a mixture of the juices of two vegetables neither of which used separately has this effect  Matting of various kinds is another considerable manufacture in which they excel in many respects the Europeans They make use of the coarser sort to sleep on and in wet weather they wear the finer  They greatly excel in the basket and wickerwork both men and women employ themselves at it and can make it of a great number of different patterns  They make ropes and lines of all sizes of the bark of the  poerou  and their nets for fishing are made of these lines the fibres of the cocoanut they make thread of such as they use to fasten together the several parts of their canoes the forms of which are various according to the use to which they are applied  Their fishinglines are esteemed the best in the world made of the bark of the  Erowa  a kind of nettle which grows on the mountains they are strong enough to hold the heaviest and most vigorous fish such as bonetas and albicores in short they are extremely ingenious in every expedient for taking all kinds of fish  The tools which these people make use of for building houses constructing canoes hewing stone and for felling cleaving carving and polishing timber consist of nothing more than an adze of stone and a chissel of bone most commonly that of a man's arm and for a file or polisher they make use of a rasp of coral and coral sand  The blades of their adzes are extremely tough but not very hard they make them of various sizes those for felling weigh six or seven pounds and others which are used for carving only a few ounces they are obliged every minute to sharpen them on a stone which is always kept near them for that purpose  The most difficult task they meet with in the use of these tools is the felling of a tree which employs a great number of hands for several days together  The tree which is in general use is called  Avie  the stem of which is strait and tall Some of their smaller boats are made of the breadfruit tree which is wrought without much difficulty being of a light spongy nature Instead of planes they use their adzes with great dexterity Their canoes are all shaped with the hand the Indians not being acquainted with the method of warping a plank  They have two kinds of canoes one they call  Ivahahs  the other  Pahies  the former is used for short voyages at sea and the latter for  longer ones These boats do not differ either in shape or size but they are in no degree proportionate being from sixty or seventy feet to ten in length and not more than the thirtieth part in breadth Some are employed in going from one island to another and others used for fishing There is also the Ivahah which serves for fighting these are by far the longest and the head and stern are considerably raised above the body These Ivahahs are fastened together side by side when they go to sea at the distance of a few feet by strong wooden poles which are laid across them and joined to each side A stage or platform is raised on the forepart about ten or twelve feet long upon which stand the fighting men whose missile weapons are slings and spears Beneath these stages the rowers sit who supply the place of those who are wounded  The fishing Ivahahs are from thirty or forty to ten feet in length and those for travelling have a small house fixed on board which is fastened upon the forepart for the better accommodation of persons of rank who occupy them both day and night  The Pahies differ also in size being from sixty to seventy feet long they are likewise very narrow and are sometimes used for fighting but chiefly for long voyages In going from one island to another they sometimes are out a month and often at sea a fortnight or twenty  days and if they had convenience to stow more provisions they could stay out much longer  These vessels are very useful in landing and putting off from the shore in a surf for by their great length and high sterns they landed dry when the Endeavour's boats could scarcely land at all  They are very curious in the construction of these boats the chief parts or pieces whereof are formed separately without either saw plane chissel or any other iron tool which renders their fabrication more surprizing and worthy observation  These parts being prepared the keel is fixed upon blocks and the planks are supported with props till they are sewed or joined together with strong plaited thongs which are passed several times through holes bored with a chissel of bone such as they usually make use of and when finished they are sufficiently tight without caulking  They keep these boats with great care in a kind of shed built on purpose to contain them  Mr Banks and Dr Solander were at a loss to find out their method of dividing time they always made use of the term  Malama  which signifies moon whenever they spoke of time either past or to come they reckon thirteen of these moons beginning again when they are expired This proves that they have some idea of the solar year but these gentlemen could  not discover how they computed their months so as to make thirteen of them equal to the year for the natives say that their month consists of twentynine days one day in which the moon is invisible being included They knew the fruits that would be in season and even the prevailing weather of the months to come  They divide the day into twelve parts each consisting of two hours six belonging to the day and the other six to the night They reckon from one to ten when they numerate making use of their fingers and changing hands till they come to the number which they intend to express and in conversation they joined signs to their words which were remarkably expressive of their meaning  They are not so expert in measuring distances as in computing numbers for when they speak of the distance from one place to another they are obliged to express it by the time that would be taken to pass it  Their language is soft and musical abounds with vowels and is easy to be pronounced But whether it is copious Mr Banks and Dr Solander were not sufficiently acquainted with it to know As very few either of their nouns or verbs are declinable it must consequently be very imperfect They found means however to be mutually understood without much difficulty  The following specimen will possibly enable the reader to form some idea of their language  Teine  a brother  Tooaheine  a sister  Tane  a husband  Aree  a chief  Midee  a

Tooanahoe  you and I  Wahaa  fire  Avy  water  In respect to diseases the natives are seldom afflicted with any except sometimes an accidental fit of the cholic They are subject to the erisypelas attended with cutaneous eruptions not unlike the leprosy and if they have had it for any time to a certain degree they are secluded from all society and live alone in a small house in some unfrequented part of the island  Here the management of the sick falls to the lot of the priests and their method of cure consists chiefly of prayers and ceremonies which are repeated till the patients recover or die If they recover they attribute the cure to these remedies if they die like the medical tribe of this and every other country they say the disease was incurable  From their connection with the Europeans they have entailed upon themselves that dreadful curse the venereal disease which upon enquiry evidently appeared to have been brought among them by the vessels under the command of Mons Bougainville It was called by a name somewhat similar in meaning to  rottenness  but of a much stronger import and they gave a most shocking account of the sufferings of those who were first infected with it telling them that their nails and hair fell off and the flesh even rotted from their bones and so greatly were they terrified at the dreadful effects of this alarming disease that the infected person was forsaken even by his own relations and left to  perish by himself in such a state of misery and pain as he had never before experienced  The religion of these people appeared to be exceedingly mysterious and as the language used on the occasion was different from that spoken in common they were not able to obtain much information respecting it but from what little they could learn from their friend Tupia these Indians seemed to have adopted strange notions of the creation of the world imagining that every thing was derived from procreation and the conjunction of two persons The supreme Deity one of these two first Beings they call TAROATAIHETOOMOO and the other TEPAPA The year which is called TETTOWMATATAYO is supposed to be the daughter of the two first They also imagine that there is an inferior race of Deities whom they call EATUAS They say two of these Eatuas formerly inhabited the earth and that the first man descended from them  They emphatically stile the supreme Being the  Causer of Earthquakes  but their prayers are more generally addressed to  Tane  supposed to be a son of the first progenitors of nature  They believe in the existence of the soul in a separate state and that there are two situations differing in their degrees of happiness which they consider as receptacles for different ranks but not as places of reward and punishment they suppose that their Chiefs and principal  A Priest of the  Discovered Islands in the Habit of his Order  Ornaments for the Ears  ring Instruments  people will have the preference to those of inferior rank as they imagine their actions no way influence their future state and that their Deities take no cognizance of them whatsoever  The office of priest is hereditary there are several of them and of all ranks the Chief is respected next to their Kings and they are superior to the rest of the natives not only in point of divine knowledge but also in that of navigation and astronomy  The priests here are no way concerned with the ceremony of marriage it being a simple agreement between the man and woman and when they chuse to separate it is done with as little ceremony as that of their marriage  These people do not seem to be any way guilty of idolatry as they worship no kind of images whatever They enter their morais with great reverence and humility and when they bring their offering to the altar their body is uncovered to the waist  There is a subordination among them that much resembles the early state of every nation in Europe under the feudal system which secured to a small number the most unrestrained liberty while the rest were abject slaves  Their ranks or orders are  Earee rahie  which signifies King  Earee  Baron  Manahouni  Vassal and  Toutou  Villain The Earee rahie of which there are two one belonging to each of the peninsulas of which this island consists had  great respect shewn them by all ranks The Earees are Lords of one or more of the districts into which each of the peninsulas is divided and they separate their territories into lots which are given to the  Manahounies  who respectively cultivate that share which they hold under the baron But they are only nominal cultivators this as well as all other laborious work being done by the  Toutous  or lower class of people  The Sovereign or Earee rahie and the Baron or Earee are succeeded in titles and honours by their children as soon as they are born the fathers being immediately divested of them but they remain possessors and managers of their estates  In case of a general attack upon the island every district under the command of an Earee furnishes a proportionate number of fighting men for the defence of the common cause and they are commanded in chief by the Earee rahieAccording to Tupia's account the number furnished by the principal districts amounted to six thousand and upwards  Slings with which they are very dextrous pikes headed with stone and long clubs made of wood remarkably hard and heavy constitute their weapons With these they fight with great obstinacy and cruelty giving no quarter to either man woman or child if they fall into their hands in time of battle  During the stay of the Endeavour there was a perfect good understanding between the Earee rahies of the two peninsulas though the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo arrogated to himself the title of King of the whole island which the other considered as it really was a mere nominal claim and only a feather in his cap There is nothing among them substituted for money or a general medium by which every object may be purchased or procured neither can any permanent good be unlawfully obtained by force or fraud and the general commerce with women sets aside almost every excitement for committing adultery In a word in a government so little polished though distributive justice cannot be regularly administered as there can at the same time be but few crimes for the exercise of it the want of this justice is not so severely felt as it would be in more civilized societies  Thursday July the th after leaving the island of Otaheite they sailed with a gentle breeze and clear weather and were informed by Tupia that four islands which he called Huaheine Ulietea Otaha and Bolabola were at the distance of about one or two days sail and that hogs fowls and other refreshments which had lately been scarce were to be got there in abundance They accordingly steered their course in search of these islands and on Saturday the th discovered the island of Huaheine and on the th in the morning they  sounded near the northwest part of the island but found no bottom with seventy fathom Several canoes immediately put off but they appeared fearful of coming near the ship till they saw Tupia which totally removed their apprehensions and they ventured to come alongside and upon assurances of friendship the King of Huaheine and his Queen went on board Astonishment was testified by their Majesties at every thing that was shewn them yet they made no researches and appeared satisfied with what was presented to their observation making no enquiry after any other objects though it was reasonable to suppose that a building of such novelty and extent as the ship must have afforded many curiosities The King whose name was  Oree  made a proposal to exchange names with Captain Cook which was readily assented to The custom of exchanging names is very prevalent in this island and is considered as a mark of friendship They found the people here nearly similar to those of Otaheite in almost every circumstance except if Tupia might be credited they were not addicted to thieving Having come to an anchor in a small but fine harbour on the west side of the island Captain Cook went ashore accompanied by Mr Banks and some other gentlemen with Tupia and the King The instant they landed Tupia uncovered himself as low as his waist and desired Mr Monkhouse to follow  his example Being seated he now begun a speech which lasted about twenty minutes the King who stood opposite to him answering in what seemed to be set replies During this discourse he delivered at different times a handkerchief a black silk neckcloth some beads and plantains as presents to their Eatua or Deity He received in return for the Eatua of the English a hog some young plantains and two bunches of feathers which were carried on board These ceremonies were considered as a kind of ratification of a treaty between the English and the King of Huaheine  On the th they went again on shore and walked up into the country the productions of which greatly resembled those of Otaheite the rocks and clay seemed however more burnt the boathouses were large and the other houses neat The level part of the country affords the most beautiful landscapes that the imagination can possibly form an idea of the soil is exceedingly fertile and the shores are lined with fruit trees of different kinds particularly the cocoanut which was seen in great abundance  They also went on shore on the th without Tupia but his boy whose name was Tayota accompanied them and Mr Banks proposed taking a more perfect view of a kind of chest or ark which he had before observed the lid of this ark was sewed on in a peculiar manner and thatched with palmnut leaves It was  placed upon two poles and sustained on small carved arches of wood the poles served to remove it from one place to another in the manner of a sedan chair it is very surprising that this chest was of a form greatly resembling the ark of the Lord among the Jews but what was still more extraordinary the boy informed them that it was called  Ewharre no Eatua the house of the God  but he could give no account of its meaning or utility with some difficulty they negotiated for eleven pigs and were not without hopes of obtaining more the next morning  Wednesday the th they carried some hatchets with them with which they procured three very large hogs As they proposed to sail in the afternoon the King accompanied by some others of the natives came on board to take his leave when his Majesty received from Captain Cook a small pewter plate with the following inscription  "His Britannic Majesty's ship Endeavour Lieutenant Cook Commander July "  He also was presented with some medals or counters resembling the coin of England and a few other trifles  This island is situated in the latitude of degrees minutes south and longitude degrees minutes west it is distant from Otaheite about thirty leagues and is about twenty miles in circumference  The productions of Huaheine seem to be a month forwarder than those of Otaheite as they found by several of the fruits c Mr Banks met with only a few new plants but found a species of scorpion which he had not seen before  The people are of a very lazy disposition though they are stouter and larger made than those of Otaheite  The women are much fairer than those of that island and in general exceedingly handsome both men and women seemed less susceptible of fear and not so desirous of information  From Huaheine they sailed for the island of Ulietea and in the afternoon came within a league or two of the shore The next morning being the th by the direction of Tupia they anchored in a bay which is formed by a reef on the north side of the island two canoes of natives soon came off from the shore and brought with them two small hogs which they exchanged for some nails and beads The Captain Mr Banks and some other gentlemen now went on shore accompanied by Tupia who introduced them with the same kind of ceremonies that had taken place on their landing at Huaheine after which Capt Cook took possession of this and the adjacent islands in the name of the King of Great Britain  They then walked to a large Morai which the natives called  Tapodeboatea  they found that  it differed considerably from the Morais of Otaheite being composed of four walls about eight or nine feet in height built of very large coralstones which surrounded an area about thirty yards square at a small distance they discovered an  Ewhatta  or altar upon which as an oblation was placed a whole hog about a hundred pounds weight At the front of this Morai facing the sea there was a kind of amphitheatre There were likewise three or four  Ewharee no Eatua  or houses of God of the same kind as that which they saw at Huaheine  On Friday the st the Master was sent in the longboat to inspect the coast on the south part of the island and a Lieutenant was dispatched in the yawl to sound the harbour where the Endeavour lay while the Captain went in the pinnace to take a view of the coast on the north part of the island in their return they saw a tree of the same kind as that seen by Mr Green at Otaheite the circumference of the trunk or rather congeries of the roots of which measured about forty yards  On the d and d it being hazy weather with brisk gales Captain Cook judged it rather unsafe to put to sea On they th they got under sail and steered to the northward within the reef towards an opening five or six leagues distant in effecting this he was in the greatest danger of striking on a rock the man who sounded crying out on a sudden two fathom  at which they were much alarmed but happily got clear without receiving any damage  The bay in which the Endeavour lay at anchor is called  Oopoa  it is large enough to contain a great number of shipping and is secured from the sea by a reef of rocks It lies off the eastermost point of the island and may be distinguished by a low woody island which lies to the southeast of it  The provisions of this island consist chiefly of cocoanuts yams plantains and a few hogs and fowls that part of the country where they landed is not so fruitful as either Otaheite or Huaheine  On the th they were within a league or two of the island of Otaha but the wind continuing contrary they could not get near enough to land till the th in the morning when Mr Banks and Dr Solander went in the longboat with the Master to sound a harbour on the east side of the island which they found safe and convenient with good anchorage They then went on shore and purchased some hogs and fowls and a large quantity of yams and plantains  This island appeared to be more barren than Ulietea but the produce was much the same The natives paid them the compliment they used towards their own Kings by uncovering their shoulders and wrapping their cloaths  round their bodies taking care no one should omit doing the same  On the th they made sail to the northward and at eight o'clock next morning they were close under the high craggy peak of the island of Bolabola The island was inaccessible in this part and they found it impossible to weather the south end of it till late at night The next morning Sunday the th they discovered an island which Tupia called Maurua who said it was small surrounded by a reef and without any commodious harbour but inhabited and yielded nearly the same produce as the adjacent islands In the middle is a high round hill which may be seen at eleven or twelve leagues distance  In the afternoon finding themselves to windward of some harbours that lay on the west side of Ulietea they intended to put into one of them in order to stop a leak which they had sprung in the powderroom and to take in some additional ballast The wind being right against them they plied on and off till the afternoon of the st of August when they came to an anchor in the entrance of the channel which led into one of the harbours  Wednesday in the morning when the tide turned they came into a proper place for mooring in twentyeight fathom In the interim many of the natives came off and brought  hogs fowls and plantains which were purchased upon very moderate terms  Mr Banks and Dr Solander went on shore and spent the day very agreeably the natives shewing them great respect Being conducted to the houses of the chief people they were received in an uncommon manner Upon their entrance into a house they found those who had ran hastily before them standing on each side of a long matt spread upon the ground and the family sitting at the further end of it In one house they observed some very young girls dressed in the neatest manner who kept their places waiting for the strangers to accost them these girls were the most beautiful the gentlemen had ever seen  One of them who was about seven or eight years old was dressed in a red gown and her head was decorated with a great quantity of plaited hair this ornament is called  Tomou  and is held in great estimation among them She was sitting at the upper end of one of their long mats on which none of the people present presumed to set a foot and her head was reclined on the arm of a decent looking woman who appeared to be her nurse when Mr Banks and Dr Solander approached her she stretched out her hand to receive some beads which they presented to her with an air of such dignity and gracefulness as would have done honour to the first princess in Europe  Before their departure they were entertained with a dance different from any they had seen before The performer put upon his head a large piece of wickerwork about four feet long of a cylindrical form covered with feathers and edged round with shark's teeth Having this headdress on which is called a  Whou  he began to dance with a slow motion frequently moving his head so as to describe a circle with the top of his wicker cap and sometimes throwing it so near the faces of the byestanders as to make them jump back this they considered as an excellent piece of humour and it always produced a hearty laugh when practiced upon any of the English gentlemen  On Thursday the d as Mr Banks and the Doctor were going along the shore to the northward with a design to purchase stock they met with a company of dancers who retarded the progress of their excursion near two hours and afforded them much diversion The company was composed of six men and two women dancers with three drums They were informed that these dancers were some of the principal people of the island and though they were an itinerant troop they did not like the strolling parties of Otaheite receive any gratuity from the bystanders The women wore a considerable quantity of Tamou or plaited hair ornamented with the flowers of the cape jessamine which were stuck in with taste and made  Representation of a Dance in the Island of Ulietea  an elegant head dress The womens necks breasts and arms were naked the other parts of the body were covered with black cloth which was fastened close round them and by the side of each breast next the arms was a small plume of black feathers worn like a nosegay  Thus apparalleled they advanced sideways keeping time with great exactness to the drums which beat quick and loud soon after they began to shake themselves in a very whimsical manner and put their bodies into a variety of strange postures sometimes standing in a row one behind another sometimes sitting down and at others falling with their faces to the ground and resting on their knees and elbows moving their fingers at the same time with a quickness scarcely to be credited The chief dexterity however of the dancers as well as the amusement of the spectators consisted in the lasciviousness of their attitudes and gestures which decency forbids us to describe  Between the dances of the women a kind of dramatic interlude was performed by the men consisting of dialogue as well as dancing but for want of a sufficient knowledge of their language they could not learn the subject of this interlude  Friday the th Mr Banks Dr Solander and some other gentlemen were present at a more regular dramatic entertainment The  performers who were all men were divided into two parties one dressed in brown and the other in white by way of distinction Tupia being present informed them that the party in brown acted the parts of a master and his servants and the party in white a gang of thieves the master having produced a basket of meat which he gave in charge to his servants the white party exhibited a variety of expedients in endeavouring to steal this basket and the brown set as many in preventing the accomplishment of their design After some time had been spent in this manner those to whom the basket was entrusted laying themselves down on the ground round it pretended to fall asleep the other party availing themselves of this opportunity stole gently upon them and carried off their booty the servants awaking soon after discovered their loss but they made no search after the basket and began to dance with as much alacrity as before  On Saturday the th some hogs and fowls and several large pieces of cloth many of them being fifty or sixty yards in length together with a quantity of plantains and cocoanuts were sent to Captain Cook as a present from the Earee rahie of the island of Bolabola accompanied with a message that he was then on the island and intended waiting on the Captain the next day  On Sunday the th the King of Bolabola did not visit them agreeable to his promise his absence however was not in the least regretted as he sent three very agreeable young women to demand something in return for his present After dinner they set out to pay the King a visit on shore as he did not think proper to come on board As this man was the Earee rahie of the Bolabola men who had conquered this and were the dread of all the neighbouring islands they were greatly disappointed instead of finding a vigorous enterprising young Chief to see a poor feeble decrepid old dotard half blind and sinking under the weight of age and infirmities He received them without either that state or ceremony which they had hitherto met with among the other Chiefs  On Wednesday the th having stopped their leak and taken on board their fresh stock of provisions they sailed out of the harbour Tho' they were several leagues distant from the island of Bolabola Tupia earnestly entreated Captain Cook that a shot might be fired towards it which to gratify him the Captain complied with This was supposed to have been intended by Tupia as a mark of his resentment against the inhabitants of that place as they had formerly taken from him large possessions which he held in the island of Ulietea of which island  Tupia was a native and a subordinate Chief but was driven out by these people  They had great plenty of provisions as well of hogs and fowls as of vegetables during the time they continued in the neighbourhood of those islands so that they were not obliged to use any considerable quantity of the ship's provisions and they had flattered themselves that the fowls and hogs would have supplied them with fresh provisions during the course of their voyage to the southward but in this they were unhappily disappointed for as the hogs could not be brought to eat any sort of European grain or any provender whatever that the ship afforded they were reduced to the disagreeable necessity of killing them immediately on their leaving those islands and the fowls all died of a disease in their head with which they were seized soon after they had been carried on board  As they were detained longer at Ulietea in repairing the ship than they expected they did not go on shore at Bolabola but after giving the general name of the  Society Islands  to the islands of Huhaheine Ulietea Bolabola Otaha and Maurua which lie between the lalitude of deg min and deg min south they pursued their course standing southwardly for an island to which they were directed by Tupia at above an hundred leagues distant which they discovered on Sunday the th and were informed by him that it was  called  Ohiteroa  The next morning they stood in for land and saw several of the inhabitants along the shore one of the Lieutenants was now dispatched in the pinnace to sound for anchorage and obtain what intelligence he could of the natives respecting any land that might lay further to the south Mr Banks Dr Solander and Tupia went also in the boat with the Lieutenant when they came near the shore they could perceive that the inhabitants were armed with lances of a considerable length The appearance of the boat soon drew together a great number of them upon the beech two of whom leaped into the water and endeavoured to gain the boat but she soon left them behind several others made the same attempt but with as little success  The boat having doubled the point where they intended to land opened a large bay and discovered another party of the natives standing at the end of it armed in the same manner as those they had already seen The boat's crew now rowed towards the shore and began to make preparations for landing upon which a canoe with some of the natives on board came off towards them they ordered Tupia to acquaint these people that they did not intend doing them any injury but wanted to traffick with them with nails which they shewed them this information encouraged them to come alongside the boat and they accepted  of some nails which were given them with much apparent pleasure and satisfaction it soon appeared however to be nothing more than dissimulation for in a few minutes several of them unexpectedly boarded the boat with an intention of dragging her on shore some musquets were immediately discharged over their heads which had the desired effect all of them leaping directly into the sea and as soon as they reached the canoe they put back to the shore as fast as they could paddle where a vast concourse of their countrymen were assembled to receive them They were followed to the shore by the people in the boat who found the surf so violent that they did not think it safe to attempt landing They therefore coasted along the shore in hopes of finding a place where they might land with less danger presently after the canoe got on shore a man with a lance in his hand ran along opposite to the boat flourishing his weapon and calling out with a shrill voice which upon enquiry of Tupia they were informed was a mark of defiance  Not being able to find a more convenient landing place they returned with a design of attempting it at the place where the canoe went on shore as they were going back the same mode of defiance was repeated by another warrior of a more formidable appearance than the first having a high cap on made of the tail  feathers of a bird and his body painted with streaks of a variety of colours When this man retired another advanced in years with a grave and sedate countenance made his appearance upon the beach and asked them several questions such as from whence they came whither they were bound and who they were Tupia having answered these questions and repeated his assurances that our intentions were amicable they appeared to be somewhat pacified The people in the boat now proposed going on shore to trade with them for such articles as they chose to dispose of if they would quit their weapons but they would not agree to this proposal on any other terms than the English leaving their musquets behind them in the boat with this however prudence would not permit them to comply especially as they had so lately experienced the dissembling nature of these people They therefore gave over all hopes of establishing a friendly intercourse with them and returned to the ship And as neither the bay which the boat entered nor any other part of the island afforded either harbour or anchorage the Captain did not think it worth while to attempt a second landing  The people of this island are very tall well proportioned and have long hair which like the inhabitants of the other islands they tie in a bunch on the top of their head they are  likewise tataowed on different parts of their bodies but not on their posteriors  This island does not shoot up into high peaks like the others which they visited but is more level and uniform and divided into small hillocks some of which are covered with groves of trees they saw no breadfruit and not many cocoanut trees but great numbers of the tree called Etoa were planted all along the shore  Their cloth as well as the manner of wearing it differed in many respects from any they had met with all that they saw was died yellow and painted on the outside with a variety of colours Their habit consisted only of one piece with a hole made in the middle of it thro' which they put their head it reaches as low as their knees and is tied close round their bodies with a kind of yellow sash some of them wear caps of the same kind as that already mentioned and others bind their heads with a piece of cloth resembling a turban  On Tuesday the th of August they sailed from this island to the southward with a fine breeze from the north and clear pleasant weather and on the th it being rather hazy they were deceived by an appearance like several high peaks of land for which they bore away but the weather clearing up convinced them of their mistake and they resumed their course to the south  On Friday the th they celebrated the anniversary of their leaving England from whence they had now been absent one year a large Cheshire cheese which had been carefully preserved for that purpose was brought out and a barrel of porter tapped which proved to be as good as any they had ever drank in England On the th John Raden the Boatswain's mate died this man's death was occasioned by drinking too freely of some rum which was given him by the Boatswain On the th about four o'clock in the morning they saw a large comet about degrees above the horizon  On Thursday the th of October they discovered land at west by north and in the afternoon of the next day they came to an anchor opposite the mouth of a little river about a mile and a half from the shore The Captain with Mr Banks Dr Solander and some other gentlemen accompanied by a party of marines went on shore in the evening in the pinnace and yawl  Having left the pinnace at the entrance of the river Captain Cook Mr Banks c proceeded a little farther up when they landed and leaving the yawl to the care of some of their boys went up to a few small houses which they saw at a little distance Taking the advantage of their absence from the boat some of the natives who had concealed themselves behind the bushes suddenly rushed out and ran towards  it brandishing the long wooden lances which they had in their hands in a threatening manner The boys perceiving them instantly dropt down the stream but were very closely pursued by the Indians the Cockswain of the pinnace therefore fired a musquetoon over their heads which did not seem to intimidate them as they still continued their pursuit he then fired a second time over their heads but with no better effect alarmed at the situation of the boat as they were now got near enough to discharge their lances at it the Cockswain levelled his piece at them and shot one man dead on the spot Struck with astonishment at the fall of their companion the others stood motionless for some time but as soon as they recovered from their fright retreated to the woods with the utmost precipitation The report of the gun soon brought the advanced party back to the boats and both the pinnace and yawl immediately returned to the ship  On Monday the th in the morning a great number of the natives were seen near the place where the gentlemen in the yawl had landed the preceding evening and the greatest part of them appeared to be unarmed The longboat pinnace and yawl being ordered out and manned with marines and sailors Captain Cook together with Mr Banks the rest of the gentlemen and Tupia went on shore and landed on the opposite side of the river overagainst several  Indians who were sitting on the ground as soon as the gentlemen began to land they immediately started up each producing either a long pike or a kind of truncheon made of stone with a string through the handle of it which they twisted round their wrist Tupia was ordered to speak to them in his language and the gentlemen were agreeably surprized to find that he was well understood the natives speaking the Otaheitean language only in a different dialect Their intentions at first appeared to be very hostile brandishing their weapons in the usual threatening manner upon which a musquet was fired at some distance from them at the effect of which the ball happening to strike the water they appeared rather terrified and desisted from their menaces The marines being drawn up the Captain with four or five of the gentlemen and Tupia advanced nearer to the side of the river Tupia again spoke to them and informed th  m that they wanted to traffick with them for provisions They readily consented to trade and requested the English gentlemen to cross the river and come over to them which was agreed to upon condition that the natives would quit their weapons but this the most solemn assurances of friendship could not prevail on them to comply with Not thinking it prudent therefore to cross the river as they would not be persuaded to lay by their arms the gentlemen in their turn intreated  the Indians to come over to them which after some time they prevailed on one of them to do he was presently followed by several others bringing their weapons with them They did not appear to set any great value on the beads iron c which was presented to them nor would they give any thing in return but proposed to exchange their weapons for those belonging to the English which being consequently objected to they endeavoured several times to snatch them out of their hands But as the gentlemen were on their guard from the information given them by Tupia that they were still their enemies their attempts to seize the arms were repeatedly frustrated and Tupia by the direction of the gentlemen gave them notice that any further offer of violence would be punished with instant death One of them had nevertheless the audacity to snatch Mr Green's hanger and retiring a few paces flourished it over his head he however paid for this temerity with his life Mr Monkhouse firing at him with a musquet loaded with ball and that gentleman afterwards with some difficulty recovered the hanger one of the Indians endeavouring to seize it  This behaviour of the natives added to the want of fresh water induced Captain Cook to continue his course round the head of the bay He was still in hopes of getting some of  the Indians on board and by presents added to civil usage convey through them a favourable idea of the English to their fellow countrymen and thereby settle a good correspondence with them Soon after an event occured though attended with disagreeable circumstances that promised to facilitate this design Two canoes appeared making towards land and Captain Cook proposed intercepting them with his boats One of them got clear off but the Indians in the other finding it impossible to escape the boats began to attack them with their paddles this compelled the Endeavour's people to fire upon them when four of the Indians were killed and the other three who were youths jumped into the water and endeavoured to swim to shore they were however taken up and brought on board They were at first greatly terrified thinking they should be killed but Tupia by repeated assurances of friendship removed their fears and they afterwards eat very heartily of the ship's provisions When they retired to rest in the evening they appeared perfectly easy in their minds and slept very quietly for some hours but in the middle of the night their fears again returned and they appeared in great agitation frequently making loud and dismal groans After some time however the friendly promises and kind caresses of Tupia again prevailed over their fears and they became so calm and resigned  as to sing a song the tune of which was solemn and slow and at the dead of night when an universal silence prevailed throughout the ship had an awful and pleasing effect The next morning after they were dressed and ornamented according to the mode of their country with necklaces and bracelets Captain Cook proposed setting them on shore that they might give a favourable report to their countrymen of the reception they had met with They testified much satisfaction when told they were going to be released but seemed under great apprehensions of danger at finding the boat approach Captain Cook's first landingplace intimating that the inhabitants here were their foes and that they always killed and ate their enemies The Captain nevertheless judged it expedient to land near the same spot which he accordingly did with Mr Banks Dr Solander and Tupia resolving at the same time to protect the youths from any injury that might be offered them The gentlemen had not been long on shore before the boys left them but on seeing two large parties of the Indians advancing hastily towards them they returned and again put themselves under their protection As the Indians drew nearer one of the boys discovered his uncle amongst them and a conversation took place between them across the river in which the lad gave a very just account of the hospitality he had met with and took great pains  to display their cloaths and finery Soon after the uncle swam across the river bringing with him a green bow as a token of friendship which was received as such and several presents were made him The body of the Indian who was shot the day before lay in the same place where he fell one of the boys had covered it with part of his cloaths and after the gentlemen had retired the Indian performed a kind of ceremony over it by throwing a green branch towards it and the body was afterwards carried in a raft across the river Notwithstanding the presence of the uncle of one of the boys all three of them by their own desire returned to the ship but as the Captain intended sailing the next morning he sent them on shore again in the evening though much against their inclination the names of these boys were Taahourange Koikerange and Maragovete They informed Captain Cook that there was a particular kind of deer upon the island likewise taro eapes romara yams a kind of long pepper bald coote and black birds  On the th Captain Cook set sail in hopes of finding a better anchoringplace after giving this bay called by the natives Toaneora the name of  Poverty Bay  and the southwest point he called  Young Nick's Head  on account of its being first perceived by a lad on board named Nicholas Young They were becalmed in the afternoon and several cances came off  from the shore with Indians who received many presents and afterwards bartered even their cloaths and some of their paddles so eager were they of being possessed of as many European commodities as possible A single tree formed the bottom of their canoes and the upper part consisted of two planks sewed together they sat on thwarts their paddles were painted red representing many uncommon figures and were curiously wrought  They were armed with bludgeons made of wood and of the bone of a large animal they called them  Patoo Patoo  and they were well contrived for close fighting  After they had finished their traffic they set off in such a hurry that they forgot three of their companions who remained on board all night  They testified their fears and apprehensions notwithstanding Tupia took great pains to convince them they were in no danger and about seven the next morning a canoe came off with four Indians on board It was at first with difficulty the Indians in the ship could prevail on those in the canoe to come near them and it was not till after the former had assured them that the English did not eat men that they came alongside the Endeavour The Chief came on board whose face was tataowed with a remarkable patoo patoo in his hand and in this canoe the three Indians left the ship  Captain Cook gave the name of  Cape Table  to a point of land about seven leagues to the south of Poverty Bay its figure greatly resembling a table and the island called by the natives  Teabowry  he named  Portland Island  it being very similar to that of the same name in the British Channel It is joined to the main by a chain of rocks near a mile in length partly above water There are several shoals called shambles about three miles to the northeast of Portland one of which the Endeavour narrowly escaped there is however a passage between them with fathom water Some parts of Portland Island as well as the Main were cultivated and pumicestone in great quantities lying along the shore within the bay indicated that there is a volcano in the island High pailings upon the ridges of hills were also visible in two places which were judged to be designed for religious purposes  On the th several Indians came off in a canoe they were disfigured in a strange manner danced and sung and appeared at times to be peaceably inclined and at others to menace hostilities but notwithstanding Tupia strongly invited them to come on board none of them would quit the canoe Whilst the Endeavour was getting clear of the shambles five canoes full of Indians came off and seemed to threaten the people on board by brandishing their lances and other hostile gestures a  four pounder loaded with grape shot was therefore ordered to be fired but not pointed at them This had the desired effect and made them drop astern Two more canoes came off whilst the Endeavour lay at anchor but the Indians on board behaved very peaceably and quiet and received several presents but would not come on board  On Friday the th in the morning they made for an inlet but finding it not sheltered they stood out again and were chaced by a canoe filled with Indians but the Endeavour outsailed them She pursued her course round the bay but did not find an opening  The next morning they had a view of the inland country it was mountainous and covered with snow in the interior parts but the land towards the sea was flat and uncultivated and in may places there were groves of high trees Nine canoes full of Indians came from the shore and five of them after having consulted together pursued the Endeavour apparently with an hostile design Tupia was desired to acquaint them that immediate destruction would ensue if they persevered in their attempts but words had no influence and a four pounder with grape shot was fired to give them some notion of the arms of their opponents They were terrified at this kind of reasoning and paddled away faster than they came Tupia then hailed the fugitives and  acquainted them that if they came in a peaceable manner and left their arms behind no annoyance would be offered them one of the canoes submitting to these terms came along side the ship and received many presents but the other canoes returning and persisting in the same menacing behaviour interrupted this friendly intercourse  The following day Sunday the th they were visited by some fishing boats the people in which conducted themselves in an amicable manner though the fish which they had on board had been caught so long that they were not eatable Captain Cook purchased them merely for the sake of promoting a traffick with the natives In the afternoon a large canoe with a number of armed Indians came up and one of them who was remarkably cloathed with a black skin found means to defraud the Captain of a piece of red baize under pretence of bartering the skin he had on for it As soon as he had got the baize into his possession instead of giving the skin in return agreeable to his bargain he rolied them up together and ordered the canoe to put off from the ship turning a deaf ear to the repeated remonstrances of the Captain against his unjust behaviour After a short time this canoe together with the fishing boats which had put off at the same time came back to the ship and trade was again begun During this second  traffick with the Indians one of them unexpectedly seized Tupia's little boy Tayota and pulling him into his canoe instantly put her off and paddled away with the utmost speed several musquets were immediately discharged at the people in the canoe and one of them receiving a wound they all let go the boy who before was held down in the bottom of the canoe Tayota taking the advantage of their consternation immediately jumped into the sea and swam back towards the Endeavour he was taken on board without having received any harm but his strength was so much exhausted with the weight of his cloaths that it was with great difficulty he reached the ship In consequence of this attempt to carry off Tayota Captain Cook called the Cape off which it happened  Cape Kidnappers  lying in latitude deg min and longitude deg min west and is very distinguishable by high cliffs and white rocks that surround it Its distance from Portland Island is about leagues forming the south point of a bay which the Captain named  Hawke  's  Bay  in honour of Sir Edward who then presided at the admiralty board  As every circumstance that tends to elucidate the manners and customs of these people must attract the attention of the curious reader we cannot omit Tayota's behaviour upon recovering from his fright occasioned by his being kidnapped He produced a fish and acquainted  Tupia that he designed to make an offering of it to his God or Eatua as a testimonial of his gratitude for his deliverance Tupia approved of his intention and by his direction the fish was cast into the sea This is an evident proof that even these unenlightened savages by the mere impulse of nature believe in the existence of a particular providence  The Endeavour now passed a small island white and high supposed to be inhabited only by fishermen as it appeared quite barren and was named  Bare Island  On the th Captain Cook gave the name of Cape  Turn Again  to a headland in latitude deg min S longitude deg min west because the Endeavour here turned again Before the Endeavour touched at New Zealand it was not certainly known whether it was an island or part of the continent wherefore the lords of the admiralty had by their instructions directed Captain Cook to sail along the coasts as far as degrees south latitude and from thence if the land appeared to extend farther to return again to the northward Agreeable to these instructions the Captain being opposite to Cape  Turn Again  changed his course from south to north and the wind having likewise veered to the south he returned nearly in his former track sailing along the coast This Cape is remarkable for a stratum of clay of a bright brown colour its prominence gradually diminishes towards  the northside but to the south its descent is not so regular  The land betwen this Cape and Kidnapper's Bay is unequal and resembles the high downs of England There appeared numerous inhabitants and several villages Wednesday the th the Endeavour came abreast of a peninsula in Portland Island named  Terakako  when a canoe with five Indians came up to the ship Two Chiefs who were in this canoe came on board where they remained all night and were treated with great civility One of the Chiefs was a remarkable comely man and his countenance was open and prepossessing Their curiosity was uncommon and their acknowledgments for the trifling presents they received were extremely grateful The Chiefs would neither eat nor drink but the servants made up for their masters abstinence by their voracious appetites The three boys had given these natives an account of the hospitality and liberality of the English which had prevailed upon them to pay this visit  Thursday the th the Endeavour passed a remarkable head land which Captain Cook named  Gable End Foreland  It is distinguished by a rock in the shape of a church spire which is very near it Here three canoes came up and one Indian came on board he received some small presents and retired to his companions  He wore a new garment of white silky flax with a border of black red and white  Many of the Indians had pieces of greenstone round their necks by way of necklaces they were transparent like an emerald and appeared on examination to be a species of Nephriticstone of which all their ornaments of this kind consisted Mr Banks and the other gentlemen obtained several pieces of it  The dialect of these Indians was not so guttural as that of the others and they spoke the most like the inhabitants of Otaheite The physiognomy of some was agreeable their noses being rather prominent than flat  On the th they anchored in a bay about two leagues to the north of the Foreland The natives in canoes invited them hither and behaved very amicably There appeared to be two Chiefs who came on board they received presents of linen which gave them much satisfaction but they did not hold spikenails in such estimation as the inhabitants of some of the islands They were dressed in jackets the one ornamented with tufts of red feathers the other with dog's skin The other Indians in the canoes traded with the Endeavour's people without attempting any imposition and towards the evening the Chiefs returned The Captain Mr Banks and Dr Solander now went on shore and were courteously received by the inhabitants who did not appear in numerous bodies  to avoid giving offence They received several trifling presents and the Captain had the pleasure to find fresh water in the course of a tour round the bay They remained on shore all night and next day Mr Banks and the Doctor discovered several plants and many beautiful birds particularly quails and large pigeons There were some houses with fences to shelter them from the wind and many stages for drying fish near the place where the gentlemen landed Dogs with small pointed ears and very ugly were the only tame animals among them At the wateringplace the Captain ordered a line to be drawn and enjoined the natives not to pass it which injunction they civilly complied with Many houses were contiguous and the lands in the adjacent vallies were regular flats neatly laid out in small plantations the ground appearing to be broken as if designed for gardens They have sweet potatoes like those of North America in great quantities and the cloth plant grows here spontaneously There is plenty of fish in the bay such as crabs crayfish and shipjacks or horse mackrel which are larger than those upon our coasts The number of supple jacks that grow in the adjacent woods render them almost impassable but they thereby afford shelter to their feathered inhabitants the flat land was planted with cocos and the hollow parts with gourds Mr Banks and Dr Solander visited several of  the natives houses and they met with a very civil reception Fish constituted their principal food at this time and the root of a sort of fern served them for bread which when roasted upon a fire and divested of its bark was sweet and clammy in taste not disagreeable but unpleasant from its number of fibres Vegetables were doubtless at other seasons very plentiful The women paint their faces red which so far from increasing diminishes the very little beauty they have The mens faces were not in general painted but some were rubbed over with red ocre from head to foot their apparel not excepted Though they could not be compared to the inhabitants of Otaheite for cleanliness in general they surpassed them in this respect in some particulars Every dwelling was supplied with a privy and they had dunghills for depositing dirt and filth The women wore a girdle made of the blade of grass under a petticoat and to this girdle was tied in front a bunch of fragrant leaves They seemed to hold chastity in but little estimation many of the young females resorting to the wateringplace where they bountifully bestowed every favour that was requested One of the officers on shore meeting with an elderly woman he accompanied her to her house and having presented her with some cloth and beads a young girl was singled out and he was given to understand he might retire with her Soon after an elderly man  with two women came in as visitors and with much formality saluted all the company according to the custom of the place which is by gently joining the tips of their noses together The officer upon his return was furnished with a guide who led him a much better road than that he had come and whenever they came to a brook or rivulet the Indian took him upon his back to preserve him from being wet several of the inhabitants were curiously tataowed and one old man in particular was marked on the breast with various figures There was an axe made of the green stone already mentioned which could not be purchased though many things were offered in exchange At night they danced in a very uncouth manner making antick gestures lolling out their tongues with other strange grimaces and in these dances old men with grey beards were as well as the young ones capital performers They carried their civility so far as to assist Mr Banks and his company with one of their canoes to carry them on board but the Endeavour's people being unacquainted with the method of steering such a vessel she was overset but no one was drowned and they reached the ship without any farther accident some of the Indians having voluntarily engaged to conduct her During the stay of the gentlemen on shore many of the natives went off in their canoes and trafficked with the ship's company  preferring at first the cloth of Otaheite to that of Europe but it soon diminished in its value Several of the Indians went on board and testified their curiosity and surprise with regard to the different parts of the ship  Sunday in the evening they sailed from this bay which by the natives is called  Tegadoo  and lies in latitude deg min south The wind being contrary they put into another bay a little to the south called by the natives  Tolaga  in order to complete their wood and water and extend their correspondence with the natives in this bay they came to an anchor in about eleven fathom water with a good sandy bottom Several canoes appeared with Indians on board and they trafficked very fairly for glass bottles and cloth The Captain Mr Banks and the Doctor went in the afternoon to examine the water and found it extremely good here was also plenty of wood and the natives behaved with as much civility as those they had just departed from  On the th Mr Gore and the marines were sent on shore to guard the people employed in cutting wood and filling water Captain Cook Mr Banks and the Doctor also went on shore the two latter employed themselves in collecting plants In their route they found in the vales many houses uninhabited the natives residing chiefly in slight sheds on the ridges of the hills which are very steep In a valley between two  very high hills they saw a curious rock that formed a large arch opposite to the sea this cavity was in length above seventy feet in breadth thirty and near fifty in height it commanded a view of the hills and the bay which had a very happy effect Indeed the whole country about the bay is agreeable beyond description and if properly cultivated would be a most fertile spot The hills are covered with beautiful flowering shrubs intermixed with a great number of tall and stately palms which perfume the air and make it most agreeably odoriferous Mr Banks and the Doctor found the tree that produces the cabbage which when boiled was very good and some other trees that yielded a fine transparent gum Between the hills were fruitful villages that might have been successfully cultivated or turned into pasturage Various kinds of edible herbage were met with in great abundance and there was reason to believe there were many trees that produced fruit fit to eat some of which the gentlemen examined The plant from which the cloth is made is a kind of Hemerocallis the leaves of which afford a strong glossy flax equally adapted to cloathing as making of ropes There are sweet potatoes and yam plantations near their houses which are carefully cultivated These gentlemen upon their return met an old man who entertained them with the military exercises of the natives  View of a perforated Rock in Tolago Bay  The Head of a new Zealand Chief curiously Tataowed  which are performed with the  Patoo Patoo  and the lance The former has already been mentioned and is used as a battleaxe the latter is ten or twelve feet in length made of extreme hard wood and sharpened at each end A stake was substituted for their old warriors supposed enemy he first attacked him with his lance when having pierced him the Patoo Patoo was used to demolish his head and the force with which he struck would at one blow have split any man's skull This mode of fighting induced the gentlemen to believe no quarter was ever given here in war The natives in this part are not very numerous they are tolerably well shaped but lean and tall their faces resemble those of Europeans their noses are aqueline their eyes dark coloured their hair is black which is tied up on the top of their heads and their beards are of a moderate length Their tataowing is done very curiously in various figures which makes their skin resemble carving it is confined to the principal men the females and servants using only red paint with which they daub their faces that otherwise would not be disagreeable Their cloth is white glossy and very even it is worn principally by the men though it is wrought by the women who indeed are condemned to all the drudgery and labour  On the th an armourer's forge was set up on shore for necessary uses Mr Banks and  Dr Solander went again in search of plants Tupia who was with them engaged in a conversation with one of the priests and they seemed to agree in their opinions upon the subject of religion Tupia in the course of this conference enquired whether the report of their eating men was founded in truth to which the priest replied it was but that they ate none but declared foes after they were killed in war This idea is however horrid and barbarous and proves that they carry their resentment even beyond death  Captain Cook and Dr Solander went on the th to inspect the bay when the Doctor was not a little surprised to find the natives in the possession of a boy's top which they knew how to spin by whipping it and he purchased it out of curiosity Mr Banks was during this time employed in attaining the summit of a steep hill that had previously engaged their attention and near it he found many uninhabited houses Here were two rows of poles about fourteen or fifteen feet high covered over with sticks which made an avenue of about five feet in width extending near a hundred yards down the hill in an irregular line the intent of this erection was not discovered When the gentlemen met at the wateringplace the Indians by desire sung their war song which was a strange medley of shouting sighing and grimace at which the women assisted The next  day Captain Cook and the other gentlemen went upon an island at the entrance of the bay and met with a canoe that was sixty seven feet in length six in breadth and four in height her bottom which was sharp consisted of three trunks of trees and the sides and head were curiously carved There was a large unfinished house upon this island the posts which supported it were ornamented with carvings that did not appear to be done upon the spot and as the inhabitants seem to set a great value upon works of this kind future navigators might find their advantage in carrying such articles to trade with Though the posts of this house were judged to be brought here the people have certainly a taste for carving as their boats paddles and tops of walkingsticks evince Their favourite figure is a volute or spiral which is sometimes single double and triple and is done with great exactness though the only instruments the gentlemen saw were an axe made of stone and a chissel Their taste however must be acknowledged whimsical and extravagant scarce ever imitating nature  Their huts are built under trees their form is an oblong square the door is low on the side and the windows are at the ends reeds covered with thatch compose the walls the beams of the eaves which come to the ground are covered with thatch most of the houses the gentlemen saw had been deserted through fear  of the English upon their landing There are many beautiful parrots and great numbers of birds of different kinds particularly one whose note resembled the European black bird but here is no ground fowl or poultry nor were there any quadrupeds except rats and dogs and these were not numerous The dogs are considered as delicate food and their skins serve for ornaments to their apparel There is a great variety of fish in the bay shell and crayfish is very plentiful some of the latter weigh near a dozen pounds  Sunday Oct they set sail from this bay which is called by the natives  Tolaga  It is seated in latitude deg min south four leagues to the north of Gable end Foreland there are two high rocks at the entrance of the bay which form a cove very convenient for procuring wood and water There is a high rocky island off the north point of the bay which affords good anchorage having a fine sandy bottom and from seven to thirteen fathom water and is likewise sheltered from all but the northeast wind  Captain Cook obtained nothing here in trade but some sweet potatoes and a little fish This is a very hilly country though it presents the eye with an agreeable verdure various woods and many small plantations Mr Banks met with a great number of trees in the woods quite unknown to Europeans the firewood resembled  the maple tree and produced a gum of whitish colour other trees yielded a gum of deep yellow green The only roots they met with were yams and sweet potatoes though the soil appears very proper for producing every species of vegetables  Sailing to the northward they fell in with a small island about a mile distant from the northeast point of the main and this being the most eastern part of it the Captain named it EAST CAPE and the island EAST ISLAND it was but small and appeared barren The cape is in latitude degrees minutes seconds south There are many small bays from Tolaga Bay to East Cape When the Endeavour had doubled the cape many villages presented themselves to view and the adjacent land appeared cultivated In the evening of the th Lieutenant Hicks discovered a bay to which his name was given Next morning about nine several canoes came off from shore with a number of armed men who appeared to have hostile intentions Before these had reached the ship another canoe larger than any that had yet been seen full of armed Indians came off and made towards the Endeavour with great expedition The Captain now judging it expedient to prevent if possible their attacking him ordered a gun to be fired over their heads this not producing the desired effect another gun was fired with ball which threw them into such consternation  that they immediately returned much faster than they came This precipitate retreat induced the Captain to give the cape off which it happened the name of CAPE RUNAWAY which lies in latitude degrees minutes longitude degrees minutes Next morning at day break they saw between forty and fifty canoes along shore many of which came off in the manner they had done the day before shouting and menacing an attack One of their Chiefs in the largest of the canoes made several harangues and by the menacing flourish of his pike seemed to bid the ship defiance but the gentlemen continuing to invite them to trade they at last came close alongside and the Chief who had been declaiming after uttering a sentence took up a stone and threw it against the side of the ship which appeared to be a declaration of hostilities as they instantly seized their arms Tupia told them that immediate destruction would ensue if they persevered in their design and at the same time assured them of the gentlemens pacific intentions and that they only wanted to traffick with them Neither his threats nor persuasions would probably have had any effect had he not at the same time shewn them some pieces of cloth which attracted their eye and brought them to reason The gentlemen now purchased a great quantity of crayfish muscles and congereels These Indians did not attempt  any fraud in their trading but some others who succeeded them took the goods from the ship without making proper returns one of them who had been particularly culpable and seemed to pride himself upon his cunning putting off with his canoe was brought back by a musquet being fired over his head and this presently produced good order But when the sailors began to traffick with the Indians they renewed their former fraudulent practices with great insolence One of them seized some linen that was hanging to dry and made off with it a musquet was fired over his head to make him return but this did not prevail and even after another was fired at him with small shot which hit him in the back he still persevered in his design Upon this the rest of the Indians dropt astern at some distance and set up their song of defiance They did not however make any preparations for attacking the ship but the Captain judged that if he suffered them to go off without convincing them of his power of avenging the insult it might give an unfavourable opinion of the English to the natives on shore He accordingly fired a four pounder which passed over them and the effect it had in the water terrified them so greatly that they made to shore with the utmost precipitancy In the afternoon they descried a high island to the west and some time after perceived some other islands and rocks in the same  quarter not being able to weather them before night came on they bore up between them and the mainland About seven in the evening a double canoe built like those at Otaheite but carved after their peculiar manner came up to the ship and Tupia entered into a friendly conversation with the Indians on board when on a sudden it being now dark they pelted the ship with stones and then retreated Tupia was told by the Indians in the canoe that the island close to which the Endeavour lay was called  Mowtohera  it was but a few miles from the mainland of no great extent but pretty high They saw a high round mountain southwest by west of  Mowtohera  which the Captain named MOUNT EDGECOMBE  The next morning November many canoes made their appearance and one which proved to be the same that gave the salute the night before came up and Tupia again engaged in conversation with the people in her After behaving very peaceably about an hour the fit of pelting again seized them and they gave the ship another volley of stones but a musquet being fired they instantly took to their paddles  In the forenoon of the same day the Endeavour sailed between a low flat island and the main the villages upon the latter were more extensive than any they had yet seen They were upon the high land next the sea and were  surrounded by a bank with rails on the top of it and a ditch There were some inclosures that resembled forts and the whole had the appearance of fortified places The Endeavour passed the night under an island about twenty miles from the main which they named the MAYOR In the morning of the d they gave the name of THE COURT OF ALDERMEN to a number of small islands that lay contiguous about twelve miles from the main between which there are several other small islands mostly barren but very high The aspect of the mainland was now much changed the soil appearing barren and the country very thinly inhabited The Chief who governed the district from Cape  Turnagain  to this coast was named  Teratu    On Friday the d three canoes came alongside with several Indians These canoes were built very different from the others being formed of the trunks of single trees made hollow by burning they were not carved or in any shape ornamented These Indians were of a darker complexion than the others but made use of the same modes of defiance and threw several stones and some of their lances into the ship  The same afternoon the Endeavour sailed towards an inlet they had discovered and anchored in seven fathom water She was soon after surrounded by several canoes and the Indians  at first did not shew any signs that they intended committing hostilities One of the Endeavour's people shot a bird which the Indians conveyed on board without testifying any surprise at the event For their civility the Captain gave them a piece of cloth But this favour had a very opposite influence to what was expected for when it grew dark they sung one of their menacing songs and attempted to carry off the anchor's buoy Some musquets were now fired over them which seemed rather to irritate than terrify them and upon their going off they threatened to return the next morning in greater numbers they came back however the same night about eleven o'clock in hopes of surprising the ship's crew but finding them on their guard they again retired  In the morning of the th a great number of canoes with near two hundred men armed with spears lances and stones made their appearance seemingly resolved to attack the ship and desirous of boarding her but could not determine at what part changing their stations and paddling round her These motions kept the crew upon the watch in the rain whilst Tupia at the request of the Captain used every dissuasive argument he could suggest to prevent their carrying their apparent designs into execution but his expostulations did not pacify them till some musquets were fired they then laid aside their hostile intentions and began  to trade they sold two of their weapons without fraud but a third for which they had received cloth they would not deliver up and instead of paying any attention to the demand that was made of it they only laughed at them and turned their expostulations into ridicule As the Captain proposed to stay some days at this place that he might observe the Transit of Mercury he judged it expedient to chastise these people for their insolence and knavery accordingly some small shot were fired upon the principal offender and a musquetball went through his canoe His companions left him to his fate without taking the least notice of him though he was wounded and continued to trade without any discomposure They for some time traded very fairly but returning to their male practices another canoe was fired upon and struck they soon after paddled away whilst a round shot was fired over them  Thus we find that theft and chicane are as prevalent amongst the inhabitants of New Zealand as those of Otaheite from whence we might conclude that in all uncivilized nations probity is not considered as a virtue or theft as a vice Having no punishment for crimes of this kind it may be urged that they are not taught to consider them as such but if nature has implanted in us just ideas of right and wrong they must operate as forcibly upon the inhabitants under the line as on those of other climes  and a native of Otaheite must be equally conscious of a breach of natural justice as the most polished European However as this is establishing the doctrine of innate ideas which would lead us into a large field of controversy we shall leave the reader to his own opinion upon this subject  In searching for a convenient anchoringplace the Captain saw a village upon a high point near the head of the bay fortified like those villages already mentioned Having met with a place to his mind near where the Endeavour lay he returned to the ship and sailed to that spot where he cast anchor  Several of the Indians came off to the ship on the th but behaved much better than they had done the preceding day They had with them an old man who had before testified his probity and discretion and he appeared to be of superior rank to the rest He came on board with another Indian when the Captain presented them with some nails and two pieces of cloth of English manufacture  Tojava  which was the name of the old man informed Mr Banks that the natives had been in great terror of the English when he was informed that the Captain and his people had no ill design against the Indians but on the contrary wanted to establish a friendly intercourse and to traffick with them Tojava then acquainted the Captain that they were often visited by freebooters  from the north who stripped them of all they could lay their hands on and often made captives of their children and wives and that being ignorant who the English were upon their first arrival the natives had taken the alarm upon the ship's appearing off the coast but were now satisfied of their good intent He added that to secure themselves from these plunderers their houses were built contiguous near the tops of rocks where they are more able to defend themselves Probably their poverty and misery may be ascribed to the ravages of this banditti who often strip them of every necessary of life Whilst they were fishing for mullets in the bay the Indians who were upon the banks testified their friendship by every possible means and gave them an invitation to come on shore  The assurances of friendship which they had received from the gentlemen on board seemed to have a proper influence upon the natives who were now very tractable and submissive and behaved with much civility to the people in the longboat which was again dispatched into the bay to fish but with little success the Indians however brought great quantities of fish dressed and dried and though they were very indifferent they were purchased that trade might not be discouraged In a word the natives now treated the English with great hospitality a large supply of wood and  good water was obtained and the ship being very foul was heeled and her bottom scrubbed in the bay  November the th the ship was visited by several canoes in one of which was Tojava who perceiving two strange canoes paddling from the opposite shore suddenly turned about and acquainted the Captain that he was under apprehensions the people in them were some of the freebooters but he soon found his mistake and returned to the ship The Indians supplied the ship's crew with as much excellent fish resembling mackrel as was sufficient for all their dinners for which they gave them some pieces of cloth  A great variety of plants were this day collected by Mr Banks and Dr Solander they had never observed any of the kind before These gentlemen remained on shore till near dark when they observed the manner of the natives disposing of themselves during the night They lay under some bushes the men nearest the sea in a semicircular form and the women and children the most distant from it their arms were placed against trees very near them to defend themselves in case of a surprize from the freebooters They had no king whose sovereignty they acknowledged which was a circumstance unparalleled on any other parts of the coast  Early in the morning of the th several canoes brought a prodigious quantity of mackrel one sort of which was no way different from the mackrel caught on our coast These canoes were succeeded by many others equally well loaded with the same sort of fish and the cargoes purchased were so great that when salted they might be considered as a month's provision for the whole ship's company  This being a very clear day the astronomer Mr Green and the other gentlemen landed to observe the Transit of Mercury and whilst the observation was making a large canoe with various commodities on board came alongside the ship and Mr Gore the officer who had then the command being desirous of encouraging them to traffick produced a piece of Otaheitean cloth of more value than any they had yet seen which was immediately seized by one of the Indians who obstinately refused either to return it or give any thing in exchange he paid dearly however for his temerity being shot dead on the spot  The death of this young Indian alarmed all the rest they fled with great precipitancy and for the present could not be induced to renew their traffick with the English But when the Indians on shore had heard the particulars related by Tojava who greatly condemned the conduct of the deceased they seemed to think  that he merited his fate His name proved to be Otirreeoonooe  This transaction happened as has been mentioned whilst the observation was making of the Transit of Mercury when the weather was so favourable that the whole Transit was viewed without a cloud intervening Mr Green made the observation of the ingress whilst Captain Cook was engaged in ascertaining the time by taking the sun's attitude The Transit commenced at hours min sec by Mr Green's observation the internal contact was at hours min sec the external at hours min sec the latitude deg min sec In consequence of this observation having been made here this bay was called  Mercury Bay    On the th Mr Banks Dr Solander and the Captain went in boats to inspect a large river that runs into the bay They found it broader some miles within than at the mouth and intersected into a number of streams by several small islands which were covered with trees On the east side of the river the gentlemen shot some shags which proved very good eating The shore abounded with fish of various kinds such as cockles clams and oysters and here were also ducks shags seapies and curlieus with other wild fowl in great plenty At the mouth of the river there was good anchorage in five fathom water The gentlemen were  received with great hospitality by the inhabitants of a little village on the east side of the river There are the remains of a fort called Eppah in a peninsula that projects into the river and it was well calculated for defending a small number against a greater force From the remains it nevertheless seemed to have been taken and partly destroyed  The Indians sup before sunset when they eat fish and birds baked or roasted they roast them upon a stick stuck in the ground near the fire and bake them in the manner the dog was baked which the gentlemen ate at King George's Island  A female mourner was present at one of their suppers she was seated upon the ground and wept incessantly at the same time repeating some sentences in a doleful manner but which Tupia could not explain at the termination of each period she cut herself with a shell upon her breast her hands or her face notwithstanding this shocking bloody spectacle greatly affectthe gentlemen present yet all the Indians who sat by her except one were quite unmoved The gentlemen saw some who from the depth of their scars must upon these occasions have wounded themselves still more violently  November great plenty of oysters were procured from a bed which had been discovered and they proved exceedingly good Next day the ship was visited by two canoes with  unknown Indians after some invitation they came on board and they all trafficked without any fraud  Two fortified villages being descried the Captain with Mr Banks and Dr Solander went to examine them the smallest was romantically situated upon a rock which was arched this village did not consist of above five or six houses fenced round There was but one path which was very narrow that conducted to it The gentlemen were invited by the inhabitants to pay them a visit but not having time to spare they took another route after making presents to the females A body of men women and children now approached the gentlemen who proved to be the inhabitants of another town which they proposed visiting They gave many testimonials of their friendly dispositions among others they uttered the word  Heromai  which according to Tupia's interpretation implied Peace and appeared much satisfied when informed the gentlemen intended visiting their habitations Their town was named  Wharretouwa  it is seated on a point of land over the sea on the north side of the bay it was paled round and defended by a double ditch Within the ditch a stage is erected for defending the place in case of an attack near this stage which they call  Porava  quantities of darts and stones are deposited to be in readiness to repel the assailants There is another stage  to command the path that leads to the town and there are also some outworks Upon the whole the place seemed calculated to hold out a considerable time against an enemy armed with no other weapons than those of the inhabitants It appeared however deficient in water for a siege They eat instead of bread fern root which was here in great plenty with dried fish  Very little land is here cultivated sweet potatoes and yams being the only vegetables they found There are two rocks near the foot of this fortification both separated from the main land they are very small nevertheless they are not without dwellinghouses and little fortifications They throw stones in their engagements with their hands being destitute of a sling and those and lances are their only missile weapons they have besides the  Pattoo Pattoo  already described a staff about five feet in length and another shorter  They sailed from this bay after taking possession of it in the name of the King of Great Britain on the th of November Tojava who visited them in his canoe just before their departure said he should as soon as the English were gone prepare to retire to his fort as the relations of Otirrecoonooe had menaced to take his life as a forfeit for that of the deceased Tojava being judged partial in this affair to the English A number of islands of different sizes appeared towards the northwest  which were named  Mercury Islands  Mercury bay lies in latitude deg min south longitude deg min west and has a small entrance at its mouth On account of the number of oysters found in the river the Captain gave it the name of  Oyster river Mangrove river  which the Captain so called from the great number of those trees that grew near it is the most secure place for shipping being at the head of the bay The northwest side of this bay and river is much more fertile than the east side The inhabitants though numerous have no plantations their canoes are very indifferently constructed and are no way ornamented they lie under continual apprehensions of Teratu being considered by him as rebels  Upon this shore iron sand is in plenty to be found which proves that there are mines of that metal up the country it being brought down by a rivulet from thence  On the th in the morning the Endeavour steered between the main and an island which seemed very fertile and as extensive as Uli Etea Many canoes filled with Indians came alongside and the Indians sung their war song but the Endeavour's people paying them no attention they threw a volley of stones and then paddled away but they presently returned and renewed their insults Tupia spoke to them making use of his old argument that inevitable  destruction would ensue if they persisted they answered with brandishing their weapons intimating at the same time that if the English dared to come on shore they would destroy them all Tupia still persisted in expostulating with them but to no purpose and they soon gave another volley of stones but upon a musket being fired at one of their boats they made a precipitate retreat  In the evening they cast anchor in fathom and early the next morning they sailed up an inlet Soon after two canoes came off and some of the Indians came on board they claimed an acquaintance with Tojava and knew Tupia's name and after they had received some presents they retired peaceably  The Endeavour was now in the bay called by the natives Ooahaouragee and Captain Cook with Mr Banks and Dr Solander c went in the boats to the bottom of the bay to examine it and they did not return till next morning They had been up a fresh water river at the bottom of the bay in three fathoms water which would make a good harbour They met with an Indian town and a hippah or place of refuge the inhabitants of which invited them to land and gave them a friendly reception At the entrance of a wood they met with a tree ninetyeight feet high from the ground to the first branch quite strait and nineteen feet in circumference and they found still larger  trees of the same kind as they advanced into the wood The Captain called this river THAMES being not unlike our river of that name They also found several young cabbage trees and a new species of the palmnut or  Pardanus    Captain Cook weighed anchor the same afternoon sailing down the river with the tide the wind blowing fresh from north northwest the next morning the flood obliged him to cast anchor again and the Captain with Dr Solander went on shore to the west but made no observations worth relating The ship at their departure from it was surrounded with canoes which induced Mr Banks to remain on board that he might trade with the Indians The chief object of these people was paper for which they exchanged their arms and cloaths and took no unfair advantages Though the traders were honest in their dealings there was one amongst them who took a fancy to a halfminute glass but was detected in secreting it and he was punished with the cato'nine tails The other Indians endeavoured to save him from this punishment but being opposed they got their arms from the canoes and some of the people in them attempted to get on board Mr Banks and Tupia now coming upon deck the Indians applied to Tupia but he having no influence upon Mr Hicks the commanding officer informed them of the nature of the offender's  intended punishment which pacified them as they imagined he was going to be put to death The criminal not only received twelve lashes but afterwards a drubbing from an old man who was thought to be his father The canoes immediately went off the Indians saying they should be afraid to return again on board Tupia however had so much influence over them as to bring them back but they seemed to have lost that confidence which they had before reposed in the English  On the d the wind being still against them they were obliged to tide it down the river anchoring between tides they passed a point of land which the Captain called  Point Rodney  and which is the northwest extremity of the river As they could not approach the land on account of the wind they had but a distant view of the main for a course of near thirty miles Captain Cook comprehended under the name of the River Thames the whole bay and the promontory at the northeast extremity he called Cape Colville in honour of the peer of that name This cape is in latitude deg min longitude deg min it is distinguishable at a considerable distance by a very high rock The river rans south by east from the south point of this cape it is in the narrowest parts at least three leagues over for near fourteen leagues when it becomes narrower It was thought to contain fish in abundance as  there appeared many implements necessary for fishing the water was in some places twentysix fathoms deep and gradually diminished There are several small islands within cape Colville which appear to form tolerable harbours There are also islands towards the western shore The anchorage is good in all parts of the bay which is defended from the sea by a number of small islands which Captain Cook named  Barrier Islands    The circumjacent country which is pretty extensive appeared to be but thinly inhabited the natives are a stout and active people and are painted red all over their canoes were ornamented with carving and were constructed upon a good model  On the th they still continued steering along the shore between the islands and the main and in the evening anchored in an open bay in about fourteen fathoms water Here they caught a large number of fish of the scienne or bream kind from which the Captain named this  Bream Bay  and the extreme points of it  Bream Head  There are numbers of rocks off this bay which were called the  Hen and Chickens  it is situated in latitude deg min seventeen leagues northwest of cape Colville There is an extent of land of about thirty miles between Point Rodney and Bream Head it is woody and low No inhabitants were visible but from the fires perceived at  night the gentlemen concluded it was inhabited  On the th early in the morning the Endeavour sailed out of the bay keeping to the northward near the shore Some islands were soon after discovered about ten miles to the northnortheast which they called the  Poor Knights  upon these islands there were some houses and a few towns that appeared fortified and the land round them seemed cultivated Towards night several canoes with a number of Indians came up to the ship and some came on board Two of the Chiefs received presents and told the gentlemen that they had had an account of the arrival of the English in those parts After their departure other Indians came up to trade and soon began their usual fraudulent practices the gentlemen had recourse to the old remedy of firing some small shot and a round shot which soon put them to flight  Sunday the th Captain Cook continued his course slowly along the shore to the north This day two canoes came up and some of the Indians came on board when they trafficked very fairly Two larger canoes soon after followed them and coming up to the ship the people in them hailed the others when they conferred together and afterwards came alongside of the ship The last two canoes were finely ornamented with carving and the people who appeared to be of higher rank  were armed with various weapons they held in high estimation their  Patoo Patoos  which were made of stone and whalebone and they had ribs of whale with ornaments of dog's hair which were very curious These people were of a darker complexion than those to the southward and their faces were stained blacker with what they call  Amoco  and their thighs were striped with it very small interstices of the flesh being left visible Though they all used the black Amoco they applied it to different parts and in various forms Most of them had the figure of volutes on their lips and one woman in particular was curiously marked upon various parts of her body These Indians seemed the superiors of the others they were nevertheless not free from the vice of pilfering for one of them having agreed to barter a weapon for a piece of cloth he was no sooner in possession of the cloth than he paddled away without paying the price of it but a musquet being fired he came back and returned the cloth All the canoes then returned ashore  The Endeavour passed a remarkable point of land which the Captain called  Cape Bret  in honour of the baronet of that name this cape is much higher than any of the adjacent land Within a mile to the northeast by north is a curious rocky island it is arched and has a pleasing effect at a distance The natives call this  Cape Motugogogo  it lies in latitude deg  min sec south and longitude deg min west It forms a bay to the west which contains many small islands and Captain Cook named the point at the northwest entrance  Point Pococke  There are many villages on the main as well as on the islands which appeared well inhabited and several canoes filled with Indians made to the ship and after coming alongside to trade shewed the same itch for cheating as the others One of the midshipmen was so nettled at being imposed upon that he had recourse to a whimsical expedient by way of revenge taking a fishing line he threw the lead with so much dexterity that the hook caught the Indian who had imposed upon him by the buttocks when the line breaking the hook remained in his posteriors These Indians were strong and well proportioned their hair was black and tied up in a bunch stuck with feathers the Chiefs among them had garments made of fine cloth ornamented with dog's skin and they were tataowed like those who had last appeared  On the th the Endeavour was among a number of small islands from which several canoes came off but the Indians from their frantic gestures seemed disordered in their minds they threw their fish into the ship by handfuls without demanding any thing by way of barter Some other canoes also came up who saluted the ship with stones One of the Indians who  was particularly active threw a stick at one of the Endeavour's men It was then judged time to bring them to reason and a musquet with small shot was fired at him when he fell down in the cance A general terror was now spread amongst them and they all made a very precipitate retreat Among the fish obtained from these canoes were  Cavalles  in great plenty and for this reason the Captain called these islands by the same name  For several days the wind was so very unfavourable that the vessel rather lost than gained ground on the th having weathered Cape Bret they bore away to leeward and got into a large bay where they anchored on the southwest side of several islands and suddenly came into four fathom and a half water Upon sounding they found they had got upon a bank and accordingly weighed and dropped over it and anchored again in ten fathoms and a half after which the ship was surrounded by thirtythree large canoes containing near three hundred Indians all armed Some of them were admitted on board and Captain Cook gave a piece of broad cloath to one of the Chiefs and some small presents to the others They traded peaceably for some time being terrified at the fire arms the effect of which they were not unacquainted with but whilst the Captain was at dinner on a signal given by one of their Chiefs all the Indians quitted the ship and they  attempted to tow away the buoy a musquet was now fired over them but it produced no effect small shot was then fired at them but it did not reach them A musquet loaded with ball was therefore ordered to be fired and  Otegoowgoow  son of one of the Chiefs was wounded in the thigh by it which induced them immediately to throw the buoy overboard To complete their confusion a round shot was fired which reached the shore and as soon as they landed they ran in search of it If these Indians had been under any kind of military discipline they might have proved a much more formidable enemy but acting thus without any plan or regulation they only exposed themselves to the annoyance of fire arms whilst they could not possibly succeed in any of their designs  The Captain Mr Banks and Dr Solander landed upon the island and the Indians in the canoes soon after came on shore The gentlemen were now in a small cove and they were presently surrounded by near four hundred armed Indians but the Captain not suspecting any hostile design on the part of the natives remained peaceably disposed The gentlemen marching towards them drew a line intimating that they were not to pass it they did not infringe upon this boundary for some time but at length they sung the song of defiance and began to dance whilst a party attempted to  draw the Endeavour's boats on shore these signals for an attack being immediately followed by the Indians breaking in upon the line the gentlemen judged it time to defend themselves and accordingly the Captain fired his musquet loaded with small shot which was seconded by Mr Banks discharging his piece and two of the men followed his example This threw the Indians into confusion and they retreated but were rallied again by one of their Chiefs who shouted and waved his patoo patoo The Doctor now pointed his musquet at this hero and hit him this stopt his career and he took to flight with the other Indians They retired to an eminence in a collective body and seemed dubious whether they should return to the charge They were now at too great a distance for ball to reach them but these operations being observed from the ship she brought her broadside to bear and by firing over them soon dispersed them The Indians had in this skirmish two of their people wounded but none killed Peace being thus restored the gentlemen began to gather celery and other herbs but suspecting some of the natives were lurking about with evil designs they repaired to a cave which was at a small distance here they found the Chief who had that day received a present from the Captain he came forth with his wife and brother and solicited their clemency It appeared that  one of the wounded Indians was a brother of this Chief who was under great anxiety lest the wound should prove mortal but his grief was in a great degree alleviated when he was made acquainted with the different effects of small shot and ball he was at the same time assured that upon any future hostilities being committed ball would be used This interview terminated very cordially after some trifling presents were made to the Chief and his companions  The prudence of the gentlemen upon this occasion cannot be much commended Had these four hundred Indians boldly rushed in upon them at once with their weapons the musquetry could have done very little execution but supposing twenty or thirty of the Indians had been wounded for it does not appear their pieces were loaded with ball but only small shot there would have remained a sufficient number to have massacred them as it appears they do not give any quarter and none could have been expected upon this occasion It is true when the ship brought her broadside to bear she might have made great havock amongst the Indians but this would have been too late to save the party on shore  Being again in their boats they rowed to another part of the same island when landing and gaining an eminence they had a very agreeable and romantic view of a great number of  islands well inhabited and cultivated The inhabitants of an adjacent town approached unarmed and testified great humility and submission Some of the party on shore who had been very violent for having the Indians punished for their fraudulent conduct were now guilty of trespasses equally reprehensible having forced into some of the plantations and dug up potatoes The Captain upon this occasion shewed strict justice in punishing each of the offenders with twelve lashes one of them being very refractory upon the occasion and complaining of the hardship thinking an Englishman had a right to plunder an Indian with impunity was flogged out of this opinion with six additional lashes Probably his adding  "that in this he had only followed the example of his superiors"  might have had no little weight in procuring him this last sentence  It being a dead calm on the th two boats were sent to sound the harbour and many canoes came up and traded with great probity the gentlemen went again on shore and met with a very civil reception from the natives and this friendly intercourse continued all the time they remained in the bay which was several days Being upon a visit to the old Chief he shewed them the instruments used in tataowing which were very like those at Otaheite employed upon the like occasion They saw the man who had been wounded by the ball when  the attempt was made to carry off the ship's buoy and though it had gone through the fleshy part of his arm it did not seem to give him the least pain or uneasiness  On Tuesday the th in the morning they weighed anchor but were soon becalmed and a strong current setting towards the shore they were driven in with such rapidity that they expected every moment to run upon the breakers which appeared above water not more than a cable's length distance they were so near the land that Tupia who was totally ignorant of the danger held a conversation with the Indians who were standing on the beach They were happily relieved however from this alarming situation by a fresh breeze suddenly springing up from the shore  The bay which they had left was called the  Bay of Islands  on account of the numerous islands it contains they catched but few fish while they lay there but procured great plenty from the natives who are extremely expert at fishing and display great ingenuity in the form of their nets which are made of a kind of grass they are two or three hundred fathoms in length and remarkably strong and they have them in such plenty that it is scarce possible to go a hundred yards upon the beach without meeting with numbers lying in heaps These people did not appear to be under the government of any particular Chief or Sovereign and they  seemed to live in a perfect state of friendship notwithstanding their villages were fortified According to their observations upon the tides the flood comes from the south and there is a current from the west  Dec Several canoes put off and followed the Endeavour but a breeze arising Captain Cook did not wait for them on the th they tacked and stood in for the shore and on the th they were about seven leagues to the westward of the Cavalles and soon after came to a deep bay which the Captain named  Doubtless Bay  The wind prevented their putting in here and being soon after becalmed they were visited by several canoes from shore with whom they trafficked From these Indians they learnt they were about two days sail from  Moore Whennua  where the land changed its shape and instead of extending to the westward turned to the south and that to the northnorthwest there was an extensive country named  Ulimaroah  where the inhabitants lived upon hogs which they called  Booah  and was the same name given them by the inhabitants of the islands in the South Seas They saw upon the coast several plantations of the Eaowte or cloth trees and some of the Koomarra They beat to windward four days and made but little way On the th the land appeared low and barren but was not destitute of inhabitants the next morning they stood in with the land  which forms a peninsula and which the Captain named  Knuckle Point  Another bay that lies contiguous Captain Cook called  Sandy Bay  in the middle of it is a high mountain which was named  Mount Camel  on account of its resembling that animal Several canoes put off but could not reach the ship which now tacked and stood to the northward till the afternoon of the th when she stood to the northeast Towards night it began to rain and blow and in the morning it was so tempestuous as to split the maintopsail and the fore mizentopsails Early in the morning of the th they saw land to the southward and on the th they tacked and stood to the westward next day they discovered land from the masthead to the southsouthwest and on the th came off the northern extremity of New Zealand which the Captain called NORTH CAPE It lies in latitude deg min south longitude deg min west and forms the north point of Sandy Bay Their situation varied but little till the th when they discovered land which they judged to be the islands of the Three Kings though they did not resemble the description of them in Dalrymple's account The chief island is in latitude deg min south longitude deg min west between fourteen or fifteen leagues from North Cape Mr Banks went out in the small boat and caught some birds that greatly resembled  geese and they were very good eating On the th it blew very hard from the east all day accompanied with heavy showers of rain and they brought the ship under a reef mainsail On the th they saw land bearing northeast which was thought to be Cape Maria Van Diemen but the sea being very bo  sterous they did not venture to approach it but tacked about and stood to the northwest  January they tacked and stood to the eastward and on the d they saw land again it was high and flat and tended away to the southeast beyond the reach of the naked eye It is remarkable that the Endeavour was three weeks in making ten leagues to the westward and that she met with a violent gale of wind in latitude deg south at Midsummer On the morning of the th they stood along the shore the coast appearing sandy and barren dreary and inhospitable steering northward on the th they saw land again which they imagined to be Cape Maria on the th they had light breezes and were sometimes becalmed when they saw a sunfish short and thick in figure with two large fins but scarce any tail resembling a shark in colour and size They continued steering east till the th when they perceived land and were soon after abreast of a point which Captain Cook named  Woodyhead  From the southwest there is a small island which the Captain called  Gannet Island    Another point remarkably high to the eastnortheast the Captain named  Albetross Point  on the north side of which a bay is formed that promises good anchorage At about two leagues distance from Albetross Point to the northeast they discovered a remarkable high mountain equal in height to that of Teneriffe the summit of which was covered with snow and it was named Mount  Egmont  It is in latitude deg min longitude deg min west and the country round it is pleasant presenting an agreeable verdure intersected with woods the coast forms an extensive cape which the Captain likewise called cape Egmont in honour of the nobleman of that name It is about twentyseven leagues to the south southwest of Albetross Point having two small islands to the north near a very high point of a conic figure This day some very heavy showers of rain fell accompanied with thunder and lightening The Captain proposed careening the ship here and taking in wood and water and accordingly on the th steered for an inlet when it being almost a calm the ship was carried by the current very near the shore but got clear with the assistance of the boats Whilst this was doing a sea lion made its appearance it is a very curious creature and answers the description given of it in Lord Anson's Voyage The Captain sent the pinnace to examine a small cove that appeared but soon after recalled her on  seeing the natives launch and arm their canoes The Endeavour anchored in a commodious part of the bay in sailing towards which spot an Indian town was descried when the inhabitants waved their hands seemingly to invite the Endeavour's people to land In passing the point of the bay they observed an armed centinel on duty who was twice relieved Four canoes came from shore to visit the ship but none of the Indians would venture on board except an old man who seemed of elevated rank his countrymen took great pains to prevent his coming on board but they could not divert him from his purpose and he was received with the utmost civility and hospitality Tupia and the old man joined noses according to the custom of the country and after receiving several presents he returned to his associates when they began to dance and laugh and soon after retired The Captain and the other gentlemen now went on shore where they met with plenty of wood and water and were very successful in fishing catching some hundred weight in a short time  On the th the Endeavour's people were engaged in careening her when three canoes came off with a great number of Indians and brought several of their women with them This circumstance was judged a favourable presage of their peaceable disposition but they soon gave proofs of the contrary by attempting  to stop the longboat that was sent on shore for water when Captain Cook had recourse to the old expedient of firing some shot which intimidated them for the present but they soon gave fresh proofs of their insidious designs One of them snatched some paper from the Endeavour's people who were trading with them and brandishing his patoo patoo put himself in a threatening posture upon which it was judged expedient to fire some small shot at him which wounded him in the knee this step put an end to the correspondence with regard to trade but Tupia still continued conversing with them and making many inquiries concerning the curiosities of New Zealand he also asked them if they had ever before seen a ship of the magnitude of the Endeavour to which they replied they had never seen such a vessel nor ever heard that one had been upon the coast though Tasman certainly touched here which was only fifteen miles south of Murderer's bay There is great plenty of fish in all the coves of this bay among others here are cuttle fish large breams small grey breams small and large baracootas flying gurnards horse mackrel dog fish soles dabs mullets drums scorpenas or rock fish cole fish shags chimeras c The inhabitants catch their fish as follows their net is cylindrical extended by several hoops at the bottom and contracted at the top the fish going in to feed upon what  is put in the net are caught in great abundance there are also birds of various kinds and in great numbers particularly parrots wood pigeons water hens hawks and many different singing birds An herb a species of  Philadelphus  was used here instead of tea and a plant called Teegoomme resembling rug cloaks served the natives for garments The environs of the cove where the Endeavour lay is covered entirely with wood and the supple jacks are so numerous that it is with difficulty passengers can pursue their way here is a numerous sandfly that is very disagreeable The tops of many of the hills are covered with fern The air of the country is very moist and has some qualities that promote putrefaction as birds that had been shot but a few hours were found with maggots in them The women who accompanied the men in the canoes wore a headdress which the gentlemen had no where met with before It was composed of black feathers tied in a bunch on the top of the head which greatly increased its height The manner of their disposing of their dead is very different to what is practised in the Southsea islands they tie a large stone to the body and throw it into the sea the gentlemen saw the body of a woman which had been disposed of this way but which by some accident had disengaged itself from the stone floating upon the water The Captain Mr Banks and the  Doctor visited another cove about two miles from the ship There was a family of Indians who were greatly alarmed at the approach of the gentlemen all running away except one but upon Tupia's conversing with him the others returned They found by the provisions of this family that they were cannibals here being several human bones that had been lately dressed and picked and it appeared that a short time before six of their enemies having fallen into their hands they had killed four and eaten them and that the other two were drowned in endeavouring to make their escape They made no secret of this abominable custom but answered Tupia who was desired to ascertain the fact with great composure that his conjectures were just that they were the bones of a man and testified by signs that they thought human flesh delicious food Upon being asked why they had not eaten the body of the woman that had been seen floating upon the water They replied she had died of a disorder and that moreover she was related to them and they never ate any but their enemies Upon Mr Banks's still testifying some doubts concerning the fact one of the Indians drew the bone of a man's arm through his mouth and this gentleman had the curiosity to bring it away with him There was a woman in this family whose arms and legs were cut in a shocking  manner and it appeared she had thus wounded herself because her husband had lately been killed and eaten by the enemy  Some of the Indians brought four skulls one day to sell which they rated at a very high price The brains had been taken out and probably eaten but the scalp and hair remained They seemed to have been dried by fire in order to preserve them from putrefaction The gentlemen likewise saw the bail of a canoe which was made of a human skull In a word their ideas were so horrid and brutal that they seemed to pride themselves upon their cruelty and barbarity and took a peculiar pleasure in shewing the manner in which they killed their enemies it being considered as very meritorious to be expert at this destruction The method used was to knock them down with their patoo patoos and then rip up their bellies  An amazing number of birds usually began their melody about two o'clock in the morning and serenaded the gentlemen till the time of their rising This harmony was very agreeable as the ship lay at a convenient distance from the shore to hear it These feathered choiristers like the English nightingales never sing in the day time  On the th the ship was visited by a canoe from the hippah or village it contained among others the aged Indian of superior  distinction who had first visited the English upon their arrival In a conference which Tupia had with him he testified his apprehensions that their enemies would very soon visit them and repay the compliment for killing and eating the four men  On the th they received no visit from the Indians but going out in the pinnace to inspect the bay they saw a single man in a canoe fishing in the manner already described It was remarkable that this man did not pay the least attention to the people in the pinnace but continued to pursue his employment even when they came alongside of him without once looking at them Some of the Endeavour's people being on shore found three human hip bones close to an oven these were brought on board as well as the hair of a man's head which was found in a tree The next day a forge was set up to repair the iron work and some Indians visited the ship with plenty of fish which they bartered very fairly for nails  On the th Mr Banks purchased of the old Indian a man's head which he seemed very unwilling to part with the skull had been fractured by a blow and the brains were extracted and like the others it was preserved from putrefaction From the care with which they kept these skulls and the reluctance with which they bartered any it was imagined they were considered  as trophies of war and testimonials of their valour In this day's excursion they did not meet with a single native the ground on every side was quite uncultivated but they discovered a very good harbour The succeeding day the ship's company were allowed to go on shore for their amusement and the gentlemen employed themselves in fishing in which they were very successful Some of the company in their excursion met with fortifications that had not the advantage of an elevated situation but were surrounded by two or three wide ditches with a drawbridge which tho' simple in its structure is capable of answering every purpose against the arms of the natives Within these ditches is a fence made with stakes fixed in the earth A decisive conquest or victory over the besieged occasions an entire depopulation of that district as the vanquished not only those who are killed but the prisoners likewise are devoured by the victors From what has been related by such unquestionable authority there can remain no doubt with the unprejudiced reader that the inhabitants of this part of the globe are cannibals There are indeed some closet travellers who treat every thing as visionary that they have not been eyewitnesses of and therefore disbelieve all they read related by real travellers that does not square with their own notions and ideas but as it may  be impossible to convince these sceptical readers we shall leave them to amuse themselves with their doubts and objections  The d was employed by Mr Banks and Dr Solander in collecting of plants whilst Captain Cook made some observations on the main land on the southeast side of the inlet which consisted of a chain of high hills and formed part of the southwest side of the streight the opposite side extended far to the east He also discovered a village and many houses that had been deserted and another village that appeared to be inhabited There were many small islands round the coast that seemed entirely barren and what few inhabitants were upon them then lived principally upon fish On the th they visited a hippah which was situated on a very high rock hollow underneath forming a fine natural arch one side of which joined to the land and the other rose out of the sea The inhabitants received the gentlemen with great civility and very readily shewed them every thing that was curious This hippah was partly surrounded with a pallisade and it had a fighting stage like that already described Here they met with a cross resembling a crucifix which was ornamented with feathers and which was erected as a monument for a deceased person but they could not learn how his body was disposed of From a conversation that Tupia had with these  people a discovery was made that an officer being in a boat near this village and some canoes coming off made him imagine they had hostile designs and he fired upon them with ball which made them retire with much precipitation but they could not effect their retreat before one of them was wounded What made this rash action the more to be lamented was that the Indians afterwards gave every possible assurance that their intentions upon this occasion were entirely friendly  On the th the Captain Mr Banks and Dr Solander went on shore to shoot when they met with a numerous family who were among the creeks catching fish they behaved very civilly and received some trifling presents from the gentlemen The next day they went to take a view of the streight that passes between the eastern and western seas they accordingly attained the summit of a hill but it being cloudy weather they could not see at any considerable distance Here however they erected a pile leaving in it musket balls small shot beads c as a testimonial of this place having been visited by Europeans Upon their return they met with another Indian family who behaved to them very respectfully and assisted in procuring them water They also visited another hippah upon a rock that was almost inaccessible it consisted of about ninety  houses and had a fighting stage The gentlemen made the inhabitants some small presents and they in return furnished them with dried fish  The ship's company were on the th and th engaged in making necessary repairs and getting her ready for sea The next day they were visited by Topoa their old friend and some other Indians They said that the man who had received a wound from the officer near the hippah was dead but this assertion proved afterwards groundless The Doctor and Mr Banks often went on shore whilst the ship was preparing for sea and made several observations upon the coast to the northwest they perceived an island at about ten leagues distance between which and the main there were several smaller islands The Captain also went on shore and erected another pyramid of stones in which he put some bullets beads c as before with the addition of a piece of silver coin and placed part of an old pendant on the top to distinguish it Some of the people who had been sent out to gather celery met with several of the natives among whom were some women whose husbands had lately fallen into the hands of the enemy and they were cutting many parts of their body in the most shocking manner with sharp stones in testimony of their excessive grief What made this ceremony appear ridiculous as well as shocking was that  the male Indians who were with them paid not the least attention to it but with the greatest unconcern imaginable employed themselves in repairing some empty huts upon the spot  On Tuesday the th two posts were erected inscribed with the ship's name c as usual one was placed at the wateringplace with the Union flag upon it and the other in the same manner on the island of  Motuara  and the inhabitants being informed that these posts were meant as memorials of the Endeavour having touched at this place promised never to destroy them The Capt  n then named this inlet  Queen Charlotte  's  Sound  and took possession of it in the name and for the use of his Majesty and a bottle of wine was drank to the Queen's health  The Captain made the old man some presents among others there were a silver threepence and some spike nails with the broad arrow upon them Topaa being questioned concerning a passage into the eastern sea answered that there certainly was such a passage and he also informed the Captain that the land to the southwest of the streight where he then was consisted of two islands named  Tovy Poennammoo  and that it would take about two days to sail round them he added that there was a third island to the east called  Eaheinomauwe  which was of considerable extent and that the land contiguous to this inlet was called  Tiera Witte    Towards night on the st a brisk gale arose attended with heavy showers and the next morning the weather became so very tempestuous that the Endeavour had her hawser broke and several casks of water that had been left on shore were washed away with the rain  The d d and th of February were chiefly spent in preparing for their departure and purchasing fish of the natives who confirmed the accounts that Topoa had given respecting an eastern passage and the adjacent islands Mr Banks and Dr Solander were in the mean while chiefly engaged in collecting seeds and shells of different kinds They got under sail the th but the wind not continuing they came again to an anchor Topaa visited the gentlemen again to bid them farewel and being questioned whether he had ever heard that such a vessel as the Endeavour had touched there he answered in the negative but added there was a tradition of a small vessel coming from a place called  Ulimaroa  a distant country to the north that there were only four men in her and that they were all put to death  Mr Banks and the Doctor went again on shore in search of natural curiosities when they met with a very amiable Indian family among whom was a widow and a pretty youth about ten years of age She had just lost her husband and was performing the ceremony of the country upon the occasion They behaved  with the utmost hospitality and courtesy and endeavoured to prevail with the gentlemen to stay all night but they expecting the ship to sail could not accept of the invitation This family seemed the most enlightened and intelligent set of Indians the gentlemen had as yet met with which made them regret they had not fallen into their company before as they would probably have derived much information from them  On the th of February in the morning the Endeavour sailed out of the bay which the ship's company from an abhorrence of the brutal custom that prevails here of eating men called  Cannibal Bay  They bent their course to an opening on the east in the evening being in the mouth of the streights they were becalmed in latitude deg south longitude deg min west The two points which form this entrance were named cape Koomaroo and point Jackson The natives call the land about it Totarranue and the harbour which the Captain named  Ship Cove  is very safe and commodious A ship may enter it either between Motuara and the island of Hamote or between the western shore and Motuara Care however must be taken to attend to the tides when there is little wind they flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon and rise and fall about seven feet and a half passing through the streight from the south east  The natives about this sound are not above four hundred in number they are scattered along the coast and live upon fern root and fish the latter of which was the only commodity they traded in They were not entirely ignorant of the use of iron bartering their fish for nails and often giving them the preference to any other trifles that were offered them they soon rejected paper when they found it was not water proof nor was the cloth of Otaheite held in much estimation by them but the cloths of English manufacture they highly valued The timber here is very good and fit for almost all purposes except masts besides fish which is in great plenty here are shags and some other kinds of wild fowl in abundance  The Endeavour having left the sound steered eastward and about six o'clock in the evening they were greatly alarmed at their being carried by the rapidity of the current very close to one of the two islands which lie off Cape Koamaroo at the entrance of the sounds The ship was in such imminent danger that they expected every minute she would be dashed to pieces but letting go an anchor and veering one hundred and sixty fathoms of cable she was brought up when they were not above two cables length from the rocks in this situation they were obliged to wait for the ebb of the tide which was not till after midnight at three o'clock in the morning  they weighed anchor and a fine breeze springing up soon after they were carried through the streight with great velocity At the entrance of the streight on the northside there is a small island which was named  Entry Island  The narrowest part of this streight which was called  Cooke's Streight  is between Cape Tierawitte and Cape Koamaroo it is about thirteen miles long and fourteen broad the safest passage is on the northeast shore the other being rocky and dangerous The two eastern points of the streight Captain Cook named  Cape Palliser  and  Cape Campbell  the first is in latitude deg min south longitude deg min west and the latter in latitude deg min southeast and longitude deg min west The Endeavour was now about three leagues from land facing a deep bay which was called  Cloudy Bay  Some of the gentlemen on board expressing a doubt that Eahienomauwe was not an island the Endeavour steered southeast in order to ascertain whether it was or not upon the wind's shifting she stood eastward and steered all night northeast by east They were off Cape Palliser next morning the th when they discovered that the land reached away to the northeast towards Cape Turnagain Three canoes came off in the afternoon with several people in them they made a good appearance and their canoes were ornamented like those of the  Indians of the northern coast They came on board without the least hesitation and behaved very civilly a mutual exchange of presents took place which was the first instance they met with of such courtesy among any of the Indians By their asking for  Whow  which signified nails it was imagined they had heard of the Endeavour's people from the inhabitants of some other place where she had touched They resembled the natives of Tolaga Bay in their dress One old man was tataowed in a very remarkable manner he was likewise marked with a streak of red paint across the nose and over both cheeks his hair was quite white as well as his beard His garment was made of flax with a wrought border under which was a kind of petticoat made of a cloth called Aooree Waow his ears were decorated with teeth and pieces of green stone His voice was soft and low and he appeared upon the whole to be a person of distinguished rank These Indians retired greatly satisfied with the presents they had received and the Endeavour after parting from them steered coastwise till the th in the morning which being a clear day it was easily determined that Eahienomauwe was certainly an island  On the th of February about sixty Indians in four double canoes came within a stone's cast of the ship which they beheld with surprise Tupia endeavoured to persuade them  to approach nearer which they refused and made towards the shore but did not reach it till after it was dark From the behaviour of these people the place from whence they came was called the  Island of Lookerson  On the th of this month they saw an island five leagues from the coast of Tovy Poenammoo which was called after the name of Mr Banks This island appeared to be inhabited as they saw a few Indians on it and in one place beheld the smoke of a fire As no farther signs of land appeared to the southward they steered to the west on Sunday the th and made various way till the d when it fell calm Mr Banks took this opportunity to go a shooting in his boat when he shot some Port Egmont hens like those found on the island of Faro and were the first they had seen on this coast On Sunday the th they saw a point of land in deg min south latitude which Captain Cook named CAPE SAUNDERS in honour of the Admiral of that name They kept at a small distance from the shore which is interspersed with hills that are green and abound in trees but they did not see a single inhabitant They had various winds and seas till the th of March when they saw several whales and sealsOn the th they saw a ledge of rocks and soon afterwards another ledge three leagues from the shore which they passed to the north during the night and discovered the others under  their bow at daybreak Thus they had a narrow escape from destruction and these ledges of rocks were denominated the TRAPS from their being adapted to entrap the unwary The southermost point of this land they called SOUTH CAPE and indeed it proved to be the southern extremity of the whole country  In the morning they sailed northward and on the day following discovered a barren rock about a mile in circumference very high and five leagues from the main land This was called SOLANDER'S ISLAND On the th they discovered a bay which contains several islands behind which if there be depth of water there must be shelter from all winds Captain Cook called this DUSKYBAY and it is remarkable for having five high peaked rocks lying off it which look like the thumb and four fingers of a man's hand whence it was denominated POINT FIVE FINGERS Three leagues to the south of Dusky Bay lies the westermost point of land on the whole coast which was therefore called WESTCAPE  On the th they passed a small narrow opening in the land where there appeared to be a good harbour formed by an island On the land behind it were mountains covered with snow On the th they passed a point consisting of high red cliffs which received the name of CASCADE POINT from a cascade of water which fell down it in several small streams  On the th in the morning they observed the vallies as well as the mountains covered with snow which they thought had fallen in the night when they had rain at sea On the d they gave the name of  Rock's Point  to a head of land off which lay some rocks above the water  They had now almost passed the whole of the north west coast of Tovy Poenammoo the face of the country afforded nothing worth notice but a ridge of rocks of a stupendous height  "which Dr Hawkesworth describes as totally barren and naked except where they are covered with snow which is to be seen in large patches in many parts of them and has probably lain there ever since the creation of the world a prospect more rude craggy and desolate than this country affords from the sea cannot possibly be conceived for as far inland as the eye can reach nothing appears but the summits of rocks which stand so near together that instead of vallies there is only fissures between them"  By the th they had sailed round the whole country and determined to depart from the coast as soon as they had taken in a stock of water For this purpose the Captain went ashore in the longboat and found an excellent wateringplace and a proper birth for the ship which being moored they began filling their  casks while the carpenter and his crew were employed in cutting wood On the th the Captain accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander went in the pinnace to examine the bay and the land on its borders on which the two last mentioned gentlemen found several plants of a species they had not seen before They saw no inhabitants but found several Indian huts which appeared to have been long deserted When they returned on board in the evening the ship was ready to sail all the wood and water being on board A council of the officers was now held as to the passage they should take to England when it was resolved to return by the East Indies and with that view to steer for the east coast of New Holland and then follow the direction of that coast to the northward  This resolution being taken they sailed at daybreak on Saturday March and taking their departure from an eastern point which they had seen on the d they called it CAPE FAREWELL The bay from which they sailed was named ADMIRALTY BAY and the two Capes thereof CAPE STEPHENS and CAPE JACKSON the names of the then Secretaries to the Board of Admiralty Between the island and Cape Farewell is a bay which they called BLIND BAY and which Captain Cook supposes to be the same that is distinguished in Tasman's Voyage by the name of Murderers Bay  We shall now proceed to give such an account of the country and its inhabitants as could be acquired during the circumnavigation of the coast Abel Jansen Tasman a Dutchman was the first European that made a discovery of NEW ZEALAND to which he gave the name of STAATEN LAND that is the land of the States General Tasman never went on shore as the Indians attacked him soon after he came to an anchor in the bay to which he gave the name of Murderers Bay From the time of Tasman's discovery which was in December till the present voyage the whole country except that part which Tasman saw remained totally unknown and has been supposed to be part of a southern continent but it now proves to be two large islands separated by a streight of the breadth of about twelve miles  The situation of these islands is between and degrees of south latitude and and degrees of west longitude The natives call the northern island Eaheinomauwe and the southermost Tovy Paenammoo  Eaheinomauwe though hilly and in some places mountainous is well stored with wood and there is a rivulet in every valley The soil of the vallies is light but is so fertile as to be well adapted for the plentiful production of all sorts of the fruits plants and corn of Europe the inhabitants of which if a setttlement  should be effected might supply themselves with the necessaries and even luxuries of life without any extraordinary exertion of their industry The summer is more equally warm though not hotter than in England and it is imagined from the vegetables that were found that the winter is not so severe  Dogs and rats are the only quadrupedes that were seen and of the latter only a very few The inhabitants breed the dogs for the sole purpose of eating them There are seals and whales on the coast and they once saw a sealion The birds are hawks owls quails and there are songbirds whose note is wonderfully melodious There are ducks and shags of several sorts not unlike those of Europe and the gannet which is exactly the same The sea coast is visited by albatrosses sheerwaters pintados and penguins descriptions of which have been given in other voyages The insects are flesh flies beetles butterflies sandflies and musquitos  Tovy Poenammoo appears to be a barren country is very mountainous and almost destitute of inhabitants  The sea which washes these islands abounds with fish which are equally delicate and wholesome food They seldom came to anchor but they catched enough with hook and line only to supply the whole ship's crew and when they fished with nets every mess in the ship  except those who were too indolent salted as much as supplied them when at sea for several weeks after The fish was not less various in kind than plentiful in quantity there were many sorts they had never before seen but the sailors readily gave names to all of them They had several sorts of mackrel one of which was the same as we eat in England These fish were catched by the natives in immense quantities and sold to the crew on the most moderate terms but the richest dainty these seas afforded was the sea crayfish which differ from those seen in England by having more prickles on the back and being red when first catched These they purchased of the natives on the north coast who dive for them and find where they lie with their feet They had several kinds of skate and a kind of dog fish of a more delicate flavour though otherwise similar to the skate eaten in London Eels congers clams oysters cockles and flat fish resembling both soles and flounders were likewise found in great plenty on this coast  This country abounds with forests filled with very large strait and clean timber There is one tree about the size of an oak which was distinguished by a scarlet flower that appeared to be composed of several fibres and another which grows in swampy ground very strait and tall bearing small bunches of berries and a leaf resembling that of the yew tree About  four hundred species of plants were found all of which are unknown in England except garden nightshade sowthistle two or three kinds of fern and one or two sorts of grass They found wild celery and a kind of crosses in great abundance on the sea shore and of eatable plants raised by cultivation only coccos yams and sweet potatoes There are plantations of many acres of these yams and potatoes The inhabitants likewise cultivate the gourd and the Chinese paper mulberrytree is to be found but in no abundance There is only one shrub or tree in this country which produces fruit and that is a kind of berry almost tasteless but they have a plant which answers all the uses of hemp and flax There are two kinds of this plant the leaves of one of which are yellow and the other a deep red and both of them resemble the leaves of flags Of these leaves they make lines and cordage and much stronger than any thing of the kind in Europe These leaves they likewise split into breadths and tying the slips together form their fishingnets Their common apparel by a simple process is made from the leaves and their finer by another preparation is made from the fibres This plant is found both on high and low ground in dry mould and in deep bogs but as it grows largest in the latter that seems to be its proper soil  Our adventurers were of opinion that no part of this country is peopled but the sea coast so that the number of inhabitants is greatly disproportioned to the extent of country and the settling a colony there is recommended as an object worthy the notice of Great Britain  The men of this country are as large as the largest Europeans Their complexion is brown but little more so than that of a Spaniard They are full of flesh but not lazy and luxurious and are stout and well shaped The women possess not that delicacy which distinguishes the European ladies but their voice is singularly soft which as the dress of both sexes is similar chiefly distinguishes them from the men The men are active in a high degree their hair is black and their teeth are white and even The features of both sexes are regular they enjoy perfect health and live to a very advanced age They are of the gentlest dispositions and treat each other with the utmost kindness but they are perpetually at war every little district being at enmity with all the rest This is owing most probably to the want of food in sufficient quantities at certain times They have neither black cattle sheep hogs nor goats so that their chief food being fish and that not at all times to be obtained they are in danger of dying through hunger They have a few and but a very few dogs and when no fish is to be got they have only vegetables such as yams  and potatoes to feed on and if by any accident these fail them their situation must be deplorable This will account for their shocking custom of eating the bodies which are slain in battle for he who fights through mere hunger will not scruple to eat the adversary he has killed  Notwithstanding this custom respecting their enemies the circumstances and temper of these people are in favour of those who shall settle among them as a colony They are in need of protection and their dispositions are so sweet that it would be an easy task to attach them by kindness Civilization would be a blessing to people whom nature has barely furnished with the necessaries of life  The inhabitants of New Zealand are as modest and reserved in their behaviour and conversation as the most polite nations of Europe The women indeed were not dead to the softer impressions but their mode of consent was in their idea as harmless as the consent to marriage with us and equally binding for the stipulated time If any of the English addressed one of their women he was informed that the consent of her friends must be obtained which usually followed on his making a present This done he was obliged to treat his temporary wife at least as delicately as we do in England A gentleman who sailed in the Endeavour having addressed a family of some  rank received an answer of which the following is an exact translation  "Any of these young ladies will think themselves honoured by your addresses but you must first make me a suitable present and you must then come and sleep with us on shore for daylight must by no means be a witness of what passes between you"  These Indians anoint their hair with oil melted from the fat of fish or birds The poorer people use that which is rancid so that they smell very disagreeable but those of superior rank make use of that which is fresh They wear combs both of bone and wood which is considered as an ornament when stuck upright in the hair The men tie their hair in a bunch on the crown of the head and adorn it with the feathers of birds which they likewise sometimes place on each side of the temples They commonly wear short beards The hair of the women sometimes flows over the shoulders and sometimes is cut short Both sexes but the men more than the women mark their bodies with black stains called Amoco In general the women stain only the lips but sometimes mark other parts with black patches the men on the contrary put on additional marks from year to year so that those who are very ancient are almost covered Exclusive of the amoco they mark themselves with furrows These furrows make a hideous appearance the  edges being indented and the whole quite black The ornaments of the face are drawn in the spiral form with equal elegance and correctness both cheeks being marked exactly alike while the paintings on their bodies resemble fillagree work and the foliage in old chased ornaments but no two faces or bodies are painted exactly after the same model The people of New Zealand frequently left the breech free from these marks which the inhabitants of Otaheite adorned beyond any other These Indians likewise paint their bodies by rubbing them with red oker either dry or mixed with oil  Their dress is formed of the leaves of the flag split into slips which are interwoven and made into a kind of matting the ends which are seven or eight inches in length hanging out on the upper side One piece of this matting being tied over the shoulders reaches to the knees the other piece being wrapped round the waist falls almost to the ground These two pieces are fastened to a string which by means of a bodkin of bone is passed through and tacks them together The men wear the lower garment only at particular times  They have two kinds of cloth besides the coarse matting or shag abovementioned one of which is as coarse but beyond all proportion stronger than English canvass the other which is formed of the fibres of a plant drawn into  threads which cross and bind each other resembles the matting on which we place our dishes at table They make borders of different colours to both these sorts of cloth resembling girls samplars and finished with great neatness and elegance What they consider as the most ornamental part of their dress is the fur of dogs which they cut into stripes and sew on different parts of their apparel As dogs are not plenty they dispose these stripes with great oeconomy They have a few dresses ornamented with feathers and one man was seen covered wholly with those of the red parrot  The women never tie their hair on the top of their head nor adorn it with feathers and are less anxious about dress than the men Their lower garment is bound tight round them except when they go a fishing and then they are careful that the men shall not see them It once happened that some of the ship's crew surprized them in this situation when some of them hid themselves among the rocks and the rest kept their bodies under water till they had formed a girdle and apron of weeds in a word their whole behaviour manifested the most refined ideas of female modesty  The ears of both sexes are bored and the holes stretched so as to admit a man's finger The ornaments of their ears are feathers cloth bones and sometimes bits of wood a great many of them made use of the nails which  were given them by the English for this purpose and the women sometimes adorned their ears with the white down of the albatross which they spread before and behind the hole in a large bunch They likewise hung to their ears by strings chissels bodkins the teeth of dogs and the teeth and nails of their deceased friends The arms and ancles of the women are adorned with shells and bones or any thing else through which they can pass a string The men wear a piece of green talc or whalebone with the resemblance of a man carved on it hanging to a string round the neck They saw one man who had the gristle of his nose perforated and a feather being passed through it projected over each cheek  These people shew less ingenuity in the structure of their houses than in any thing else belonging to them they are from sixteen to twentyfour feet long ten or twelve wide and six or eight in height The frame is of slight sticks of wood and the walls and roof are made of dry grass pretty firmly compacted Some of them are lined with the bark of trees and the ridge of the house is formed by a pole which runs from one end to the other The door is only high enough to admit a person crawling on hands and knees and the roof is stoping There is a square hole near the door serving both for window and chimney near which is the fireplace A plank is placed near  the door adorned with a sort of carving and this they consider as an ornamental piece of furniture The side walls and roof projecting two or three feet beyond the walls at each end form a sort of portico where benches are placed to sit on The fire is made in the middle of a hollow square in the floor which is enclosed with wood or stone They sleep near the walls where the ground is covered with straw for their beds  Some who can afford it and whose families are large have three or four houses enclosed within a court yard Their cloaths arms feathers some illmade tools and a chest in which all these are deposited form all the furniture of the inside of the house Their hammers to beat fernroot gourds to hold water and baskets to contain provisions are placed without the house  One house was found near forty feet long twenty wide and fourteen high Its sides were adorned with carved planks of workmanship superior to the rest but the building appeared to have been left unfinished  Though the people sleep warm enough at home they seem to despise the inclemency of the weather when they go in search of fish or fernroots Sometimes indeed they place a small defence to windward but frequently sleep under bushes with their arms placed round them without the least shelter whatever  Besides the fernroot which serves them for bread they feed on albatrosses penguins and some other birds Whatever they eat is either roasted or baked as they have no vessel in which water can be boiled  They saw no plantations of coccos potatoes and yams to the southward though there were many in the northern partsThe natives drink no other liquor than water and enjoy perfect and uninterrupted healthWhen wounded in battle the wound heals in a very short time without the application of medicine and the very old people carry no other marks of decay about them than the loss of their hair and teeth and a failure of their muscular strengthbut enjoy an equal share of health and chearfulness with the youngestSuch are the happy effects of exercise and temperance  The canoes of this country are not unlike the whaleboats of New England being long and narrow The larger sort seem to be built for war and will hold from thirty to one hundred men One of these at Tolaga measured near seventy feet in length six in width and four in depth It was sharp at the bottom and consisted of three lengths about two or three inches thick and tied firmly together with strong plaiting each side was formed of one entire plank about twelve inches broad and about an inch and a half thick which were fitted to the bottom part with equal strength and ingenuity  Several thwarts were laid from one side to the other to which they were securely fastened in order to strengthen the canoes  Some few of their canoes at Mercury Bay and Opoorage are all made entirely of one trunk of wood which is made hollow by fire but by far the greater part are built after the plan above described The smaller boats which are used chiefly in fishing are adorned at head and stern with the figure of a man the eyes of which are composed of the white shells of seaears a tongue of enormous size is thrust out of the mouth and the whole face is a picture of the most absolute deformity The grander canoes which are intended for war are ornamented with open work and covered with fringes of black feathers which gives the whole an air of perfect elegance the side boards which are carved in a rude manner are embellished with tufts of white feathers  These vessels are rowed with a kind of paddles between five and six feet in length the blade of which is a long oval gradually decreasing till it reaches the handle and the velocity with which they row with these paddles is really surprising Their sails are composed of a kind of mat or netting which is extended between two upright poles one of which is fixed on each side Two ropes fastened to the top of each pole serve instead of sheets  A War Canoe  A Branch of the BreadfruitTree  The vessels are steered by two men having each a paddle and sitting in the stern but they can only sail before the wind in which direction they move with considerable swiftness  These Indians use axes adzes and chissels with which last they likewise bore holes The chissels are made of jasper or of the bone of a man's arm and their axes and adzes of a hard black stone They use their small jasper tools till they are blunted and then throw them away having no instrument to sharpen them with The Indians at Tolaga having been presented with a piece of glass drilled a hole through it and hung it round the neck A small bit of jasper is thought to have been the tool they used in drilling it  Their tillage of the ground is excellent owing to the necessity they are under of cultivating or running the risk of starving At Tegadoo their crops were just put into the ground and the surface of the field was as smooth as a garden the roots were ranged in regular lines and to every root there remained a hillock A long narrow stake sharpened to an edge at bottom with a piece fixed across a little above it for the convenience of driving it into the ground with the foot supplies the place both of plough and spade The soil being light their work is not very laborious and with this instrument alone they will turn up ground of six or seven acres in extent  The seine the large net which has been already noticed is produced by the united labour and is probably the joint property of a whole town Their fishhooks are of shell or bone and they have baskets of wickerwork to hold the fish  Their warlike weapons are spears darts battleaxes and the patoopatoo The spear which is pointed at each end is about sixteen feet in length and they hold it in the middle so that it is difficult to parry a push from it Whether they fight in boats or on shore the battle is hand to hand so that they must make bloody work of it They trust chiefly in the patoo patoo which is fastened to their wrists by means of a strong strap that it may not be wrenched out of their hand These are worn in the girdles of people of a superior rank as a military ornament They have a kind of staff of distinction which is carried by the principal warriors It is formed of a whale's rib is quite white and adorned with carvings feathers and the hair of their dogs and they sometimes carried a stick six feet long inlaid with shells and otherwise adorned like the military staff This honourable mark of distinction was commonly borne by the old men  When they came to attack the English there was usually one or more thus distinguished in each canoe It was their custom to stop at about fifty or sixty yards distance from the ship  A  Zealand Warrior in the Dress of his Country  The manner in which a  of Otaheiti  The manner in which the New Zealand Warriors  when the commanding officer arising from his seat and putting on a garment of dog's skin used to direct them how to proceed When they were too far from the ship to reach it either with stone or lance they cried out  Haromai haromai harre uta a patoopatoo oge    "Come to us come on shore and we will kill you all with our patoopatoos"  During these menaces they approached the ship till they came alongside talking peaceably at intervals and answering whatever questions they were asked Then again their threats were renewed till imagining the sailors were afraid of them they began the warsong and dancean engagement always followed and sometimes continued till the firing of small shot repulsed them at others only till they had satiated their vengeance by throwing a few stones on board the ship  In the wardance their motions are numerous their limbs are distorted and their faces are agitated Their tongue hangs out of their mouths to a vast length and their eyelids are drawn so as to form a circle round the eye they shake their darts brandish their spears and wave their patoopatoos to and fro in the air They accompany this dance with a song which is sung in concert every strain ending with a loud and deep sigh There is an activity and vigour in their dancing which is truly admirable and their idea of keeping time in music is such that sixty or eighty paddles will strike  at once against the sides of their boats and make only one report  They sometimes sing in times of peace in a manner resembling the warsong but then they do not dance with it The women whose voices are exceeding soft and harmonious likewise sing in a melodious but mournful manner and their songs appear as if sung in parts Their instruments of musick are a shell from which they produce a sound resembling that made by a common horn and a wooden pipe not superior in musical sound to a child's whistle  These people fortify all their hippahs or towns of which there are several between the bay of Plenty and queen Charlotte's sound In these the inhabitants of those parts constantly reside but near Tolaga Tegadoo Hawk's bay and Poverty bay there are no towns only single houses at a considerable distance apart On the sides of the hills were erected long stages supplied with darts and stones which were thought to be retreats in time of battle and on which from their elevated situation they can combat the enemy with these weapons to great advantage In these repositories they store their dried fish and fernroots The inhabitants of this part of the country were all subject to Teratu who resided near the bay of Plenty and to their being thus united under one Chief they owed a security unknown to the inhabitants of the other parts  of the country There were several inferior governors in Teratus's dominions to whom the most implicit obedience was paid One of the inhabitants having robbed the English complaint was made to a Chief who chastised him by kicking and striking him while the thief bore his punishment with unresisting humility  The inhabitants of the southern parts appeared to be copartners in their fishingnets and fine apparel The latter which probably were obtained in war were kept in a little hut destined for that use in the centre of the town and the several parts of the nets being made by different families were afterwards joined together for the common use The gentlemen imagined that the employment of the men consisted in cultivating the ground making nets catching birds and fishing while the women were engaged in weaving cloth procuring fernroots and shell fish and dressing food  With regard to religion they acknowledge one superior being and several subordinate Their mode of worship could not be learned nor was any place proper for that purpose seen There was indeed a small square area encompassed with stones in the middle of which hung a basket of fernroots on one of their spades This they said was offered to the gods in the hope of a plentiful crop of provisions  The inhabitants of the southern district said they disposed of their dead by throwing them into the sea but those of the north said they buried them in the ground our adventurers however saw not the least sign of any grave or monument but the body of almost every inhabitant bore the marks of wounds which they had given themselves in token of grief for the loss of their friends and relations Some of these scars were newly made which is a proof that their friends had died while the ship's crew were there yet no one saw any thing like a funeral as these islanders conceal every thing respecting the dead with the utmost caution  A great similitude was observed between the dress furniture boats and nets of the New Zealanders and those of the inhabitants of the Southsea islands which furnished a strong proof that the common ancestors of both were natives of the same country Indeed the inhabitants of these different places have a tradition that their ancestors migrated from another country many ages since and they both agree that this country was called HEAWIGE But perhaps a yet stronger proof that their origin was the same will arise from the similitude of their language of which the following is a specimen  NEW ZEALAND  OTAHEITE     Whahine  Aheine  A woman  Taata  Tata  People  Heoooo  Eraowroo  The hair  Erai  Irai  The brow  Mata  Matau  The eyes  Ahewh  Eahoo  The nose  Paparinga  Paparea

Seven  Iva  Iva  Nine  Heneaho  Eneeho  The teeth  They sailed from Cape Farewell on the st of March and had fine weather and a fair wind till the th of April when they saw a tropic bird in the latitude of degrees minutes south a sight very unusual in so high a latitude On the th they saw an eggbird and a gannet and on the day following a small landbird perched on the rigging from which they concluded they were near land but they found no ground with fathom On the th in the morning they saw a pintadobird and some  Port Egmont hens an infallible sign that land was not very distant At six o'clock in the morning of the th they discovered land four or five leagues distant the southermost part of which was called POINT HICKS in compliment to Mr Hicks the first Lieutenant who made the discovery of it At noon they discovered another point of the same land rising in a round hillock extremely like the RamHead at the entrance of Plymouth Sound for which reason Captain Cook gave it the same name What they had yet seen of the land was low and even and the inland parts were green and covered with wood They now saw three waterspouts at the same time one of which continued a quarter of an hour At six in the evening the northermost point on the main land which was distant about two leagues was named CAPE HOWE On the following day they had a distant view of the country which was in general covered with wood and interspersed with several small lawns It appeared to be inhabited as smoke was seen in several places At four o'clock the next morning they saw a high mountain which from its shape they called MOUNT DROMEDARY under which there is a point which received the name of POINT DROMEDARY In the evening they were opposite a point of land which rose perpendicularly and was called POINT UPRIGHT On Sunday the d they were so near the shore as to see several of  the inhabitants on the coast who were of a very dark complexion if not perfect negroes At noon they saw a remarkably peaked hill to which the Captain gave the name of the PIGEONHOUSE from its resemblance to such a building The trees on this island were both tall and large but they saw no place fit to give shelter even to a boat  The Captain gave the name of CAPE GEORGE to a point of land which he discovered on St George's day about two leagues to the north of which the sea formed a bay which from its shape was called LONG NOSE eight leagues from which lies REDPOINT so called from the colour of the soil in its neighbourhood On the th they saw several of the inhabitants walking along the shore four of them carrying a canoe on their shoulders but as they did not attempt coming off to the ship the Captain took Messrs Banks and Solander and Tupia in the yawl and employed four men to row them to that part of the shore where the natives appeared near which four small canoes laid close in land The Indians sat on the rocks till the yawl was within a quarter of a mile of the shore and then ran away into the woods The surf beating violently on the beach prevented the boat from landing the gentlemen were therefore obliged to make what observations they could at a distance The canoes resembled the smaller sort of those of New Zealand They  saw with longing eyes a great number of cabbagetrees on shore the other trees were of the palmkind and there was no underwood among them  At five in the evening they returned to the ship and a light breeze springing up they sailed to the northward where they discovered several people on shore round a fire who on their approach retired to an eminence soon after which two canoes arrived on the shore and four men who came in them joined the others The pinnace having been sent a head to sound arrived near the spot where the Indians had stationed themselves on which one of them hid himself among the rocks near the landingplace and the others retreated farther up the hill The pinnace keeping along shore the Indians walked nearly in a line with her They were armed with long pikes and a weapon resembling a cymeter and by various signs and words invited the boat's crew to land Those who did not follow the boat having observed the approach of the ship brandished their weapons and threw themselves into threatening attitudes The bodies thighs and legs of two of these were painted with white streaks and their faces were almost covered with a white powder They talked to each other with great emotion and each of them held a kind of cymeter in his hand  The ship having come to an anchor they observed a few huts in which were some of the natives and saw some canoes in each of which was a man busily employed in striking fish with a kind of spear They had anchored opposite a village of about eight houses and observed an old woman and three children come out of a wood laden with fuel for a fire they were met by three smaller children all of whom as well as the woman were quite naked The old woman frequently looked at the ship with the utmost indifference and as soon as she had made a fire the fishermen brought their canoes on shore and they set about dressing their dinner with as much composure as if a ship had been no extraordinary sight  Having formed a design of landing they manned the boats and took Tupia with them and they had no sooner come near the shore than two men advanced as if to dispute their setting foot on land They were each of them armed with different weapons They called out aloud in a harsh tone  warra warra wai  the meaning of which Tupia did not understand The Captain threw them beads nails and other trifles which they took up and seemed to be delighted with He then made signs that he wanted water and used every possible means to convince them that no injury was intended They now made signs to the boat's crew to land on which they put the boat in but they  had no sooner done so than the two Indians came again to oppose them A musquet was now fired between them on the report of which one of them dropped a bundle of lances which he instantly snatched up again in great haste One of them then threw a stone at the boat on which the Captain ordered a musket loaded with small shot to be fired which wounding the eldest of them on the legs he retired hastily to one of their houses which stood at some little distance The people in the boats now landed imagining that the wound which this man had received would put an end to the contest in this however they were mistaken for he immediately returned with a kind of shield of an oval figure painted white in the middle with two holes in it to see through They now advanced with great intrepidity and both discharged their lances at the boat's crew but did not wound any of them Another musket was now fired at them on which they threw another lance and then took to their heels The crew now went up to the huts in one of which they found the children who had secreted themselves behind some bark They looked at them but left them without their knowing they had been seen and having thrown some pieces of cloth ribbons beads and other things into the hut they took several of their lances and reimbarked in the boat The canoes on this coast were about thirteen feet in length  each made of the bark of a single tree tied up at the ends and kept open in the middle by means of sticks placed across them their paddles are very small and they use two at a time  They now sailed to the north point of the bay where they found a plenty of fresh water On taking a view of the hut where they had seen the children they had the mortification to find that every Indian was fled and that they had left all the presents behind them The Captain now went in the pinnace to inspect the bay and saw several of the natives who all fled as he approached them Some men having been sent to get wood and water they no sooner came on board to dinner than the natives came down to the place and examined the casks with great attention but did not offer to remove them When the people were on shore in the afternoon about twenty of the natives all armed advanced within a trifling distance of them and then stopped while two of their number approached still nearer Mr Hicks the commanding officer on shore went towards them with presents in his hands and endeavoured by every possible means to assure them of his friendly intentions but to no purpose for they retired before he came up to them In the evening Messrs Banks and Solander went with the Captain to a cove north of the bay where they catched between three and four hundred weight of fish in four hauls  On Monday the th the natives came down to the huts before it was light and were repeatedly heard to shout very loud and soon after daybreak they were seen on the beach but quickly retired about a mile and kindled several fires in the woods This day some of the ship's crew being employed in cutting grass at a distance from the main body of those on shore a party of Indians made towards them on which the grasscutters retreated to the main body while the natives pursued them but stopping within fifty or sixty yards of them they shouted several times and retired to the woods In the evening they behaved exactly in the same manner when the Captain followed them alone and unarmed for some time but they still retired as he approached  On Tuesday May the first the south point of the bay was named SUTHERLAND POINT one of the seamen of the name of Sutherland having died that day and been buried on shore This day Messrs Banks Solander the Captain and a few other gentlemen went on shore and left more presents in the huts such as lookingglasses combs c but the former ones had not been taken awayMaking an excursion about the country they found it agreeably variegated with wood and lawn The trees being strait and tall and without underwood the country might be cultivated without cutting down one of them The grass grows in large  tufts almost close to each other and there is a great plenty of it In this excursion they met with many places where the inhabitants had slept without shelter but they saw only one man who ran away the moment he beheld them They left more presents in their huts and at their sleepingplaces in hopes of producing a friendly intercourse They saw the dung of an animal which fed on grass and traced the footsteps of another which had claws like a dog and was probably about the size of a wolf they discovered the track of a small animal whose foot was like that of a polecat and saw one animal alive about the size of a rabbit They found some wood which had been felled and the bark stripped off by the natives and saw several growing trees in which steps had been cut for the convenience of ascending them The trees abounded with a vast variety of beautiful birds among which were cockatoos parroquets and loriquets which flew in large flocks  The second Lieutenant Mr Gore having been with a boat to dredge for oysters saw some Indians who made signs for him to come on shore which he declined Having finished his business he sent the boat away and went by land with a Midshipman to join the party that was getting water In their way they met with more than twenty of the natives who followed them so close as to come within a few yards  of them Mr Gore stopped and faced them on which the Indians stopped also and when he proceeded again they followed him but they did not attack him though they had each man his lance The Indians coming in sight of the Waterers stood still at the distance of a quarter of a mile while Mr Gore and his companion reached their shipmates in safety Two or three of the Waterers now advanced towards the Indians but observing they did not retire they very imprudently turned about and retreated hastily this apparent cowardice inspirited the savages who discharged four lances at the fugitives which flying beyond them they escaped unhurt They now stopped to pick up the lances on which the Indians retired in their turn At this instant the Captain came up with Messrs Banks Solander and Tupia and advancing made signs of friendship but the poor natives would not wait their coming up to them  On the following day they again went on shore where many plants were collected by Dr Solander and Mr Banks They saw several parties of the Indians who all ran away on their approach Tupia having learnt to shoot frequently strayed alone to shoot parrots and the Indians constantly fled from him with as much precipitation as from the English On the d of May fourteen or fifteen Indians in the same number of canoes were engaged in  striking fish within half a mile of the wateringplace At this time a party of the ship's crew were shooting near the fishermen one of whom Mr Banks observed to haul up his canoe on the beach and approach the people who were shooting He watched their motions unobserved by them for more than a quarter of an hour then put off his boat and returned to his fishing  At this time the Captain with Dr Solander and another gentleman went to the head of the bay to try to form some connection with the Indians On their first landing they found several Indians on shore who immediately retreated to their canoes and rowed off They went up the country where they found the soil to be a deep black mould which appeared to be calculated for the production of any kind of grain They saw some of the finest meadows that were ever beheld and met with a few rocky places the stone of which is sandy and seemed to be admirably adapted for building In the woods they found a tree bearing cherries if shape and colour may entitle them to that name the juice of which was agreeably tart They now returned to their boat and seeing a fire at a distance rowed towards it but the Indians fled on their approach Near the beach they found seven canoes and as many fires from whence they judged that each fisherman had dressed his own dinner There were oysters lying on the spot and some muscles roasting  on the fire They ate of these fish and left them some beads and other trifles in return They now returned to the ship and in the evening Mr Banks went out with his gun and saw a great number of quails some of which he shot and they proved to be the same kind as those of England  On the following day a Midshipman having strayed from his companions came suddenly on an old man and woman and some children who were sitting naked under a tree together They seemed afraid of him but did not run away The man wore a long beard and both him and the woman were greyheaded but the woman's hair was cut short This day likewise two of another party met with six Indians on the border of a wood one of whom calling out very loud a lance was thrown from the wood which narrowly missed them The Indians now ran off and on looking round they saw a youth descend from a tree who had doubtless been placed there for the purpose of throwing the lance at them This day the Captain went up the country on the northside of the bay which he found to resemble the moory grounds of England but the land was thinly covered with plants about sixteen inches high The hills rise gradually behind each other to a great distance and between them is marshy ground Those who had been sent out to fish this day met with great success and the  second Lieutenant struck a fish called the stingray which weighed near two hundred and fifty pounds The next morning a fish of the same kind was catched which weighed three hundred and fifty pounds  The name of BOTANY BAY was given to this place from the large number of plants collected by Messrs Banks and Solander This country produces two kinds of wood which may be deemed timber one of which is tall and strait like the pine and the other is hard heavy and darkcoloured like  lignum vitae  it yields a red gum like  sanguis draconis  and bears some resemblance to an English oak There are mangroves in abundance several kinds of palm and a few shrubs Among other kinds of birds crows were found here exactly like those of England There is great plenty of waterfowl among the flats of sand and mud one of which is shaped like a pelican is larger than a swan and has black and white feathers These banks of mud abound with cockles muscles oysters and other shellfish which greatly contribute towards the support of the natives who sometimes dress them on shore and at other times in their canoes They likewise catch many other sorts of fish with hook and line  While captain Cook remained in the harbour the English colours were displayed on shore daily and the name of the ship with the date  of the year was carved on a tree near the place where they took in their water  They sailed from BOTANY BAY on the th of May at noon were off a harbour which they called PORT JACKSON and in the evening near a bay to which they gave the name of BROKEN BAY The next day at noon the northermost land in sight projected so as to justify the calling it CAPE THREE POINTS On Wednesday the th they saw two exceeding beautiful rainbows the colours of which were strong and lively and those of the inner one so bright as to reflect its shadow on the water They made a complete semicircle and the space between them was much darker than the rest of the sky On Thursday they passed a low rocky point which was named POINT STEPHENS near which was an inlet denominated PORT STEPHENS Next day they saw smoke in several places on the shore and in the evening discovered three remarkably high hills near each other which the Captain named the THREE BROTHERS  On Sunday the th they saw the smoke of many fires on a point of land which was therefore called SMOKEY CAPE As they proceeded northward from BOTANY BAY the land appeared high and well covered with wood On Tuesday morning by the assistance of their glasses they discovered about a score of the Indians each loaded with a bundle which they  imagined to be palmleaves to thatch their houses They traced them for more than an hour during which time they took not the least notice of the ship at length they left the beach and were lost behind a hill which they gained by a gentle ascentAt noon the Captain discovered a high point of land which he called CAPE BYRON In the evening they discovered breakers at a considerable distance from the shore so that they were obliged to tack and get into deeper water which having done they lay with the head of the vessel to the land till the next morning when they were astonished to find themselves farther to the southward than they had been the preceding evening notwithstanding they had a southerly wind all night In the morning they passed the breakers near a peaked mountain which was named MOUNT WARNING and the point off which they lay was called POINT DANGER The next day they saw more breakers near a point which was distinguished by the name of POINT LOOKOUT to the north of which lies a bay which Captain Cook called MORETON'S BAY and the north point of which he named CAPE MORETON Near this place are three hills which were called the GLASS HOUSES from the very strong resemblance they bore to such buildings  On the th they descried a point so unequal that it looks like two small islands lying under the land and it was therefore called  DOUBLE ISLAND POINT At noon by the help of glasses they discovered some sands which lay in spots of several acres which they observed were moveable and that some of them had not been long in their present situation as they saw trees half buried and the tops of others still green likewise the naked trunks of some that had been destroyed by the sand At this time two beautiful watersnakes swam by the ship which seemed to be distinguished from landsnakes only by their broad and flat tails which it was thought were useful to them in swimming On the th they sailed by a point of land on which a large number of the Indians were assembled from whence it was called INDIAN HEAD They soon afterwards saw many more of the natives and observed smoke in the daytime and fires by night The next day they saw a point which was named SANDY CAPE from two large tracts of white sand that were on it They next passed a shoal which was called BREAK SEA SPIT because they had now smooth water after having long encountered a high sea They had for some days past seen the seabirds called boobies none of which they had met with before and which from half an hour before sunrising to half an hour after were continually passing the ship in large flights from which it was conjectured that there was a river or inlet of shallow water to the southward where they  went to feed in the day returning in the evening to some islands to the northward In honour of Captain Hervey this bay was called HERVEY'S BAY  On the d by the help of their glasses they discovered that the land was covered with palmnut trees none of which they had seen since they quitted the islands within the tropic The next morning early the Captain took a party of men and being attended by Tupia and the several gentlemen on board went on shore to examine the country They landed a little within the point of a bay which led into a large lagoon by the sides of which grows the true mangrove as it also does on some bogs and swamps of saltwater which they discovered There were many nests of a singular kind of ant as green as grass in the branches of these mangroves When the branches were disturbed they came forth in great numbers and bit the disturber most severely These trees likewise afforded shelter for immense numbers of green caterpillars their bodies were covered with hairs which on the touch gave a pain similar to the sting of a nettle but much more acute These insects ranged themselves side by side on the leaves thirty or forty together in a very regular manner They saw among the sand banks many birds larger than swans which they imagined were pelicans and they shot a kind of bustard which weighed seventen  pounds This bird proved very delicate food and gave name to the place which was called BUSTARDBAY They likewise shot a duck of a most beautiful plumage with a white beak They found vast numbers of oysters of various sorts and among the rest some hammer oysters of a curious kind While the gentlemen were in the woods several of the natives came down and took a survey of the ship and then departed The gentlemen on shore saw fires in many places and repairing to one of them they found about a dozen small fires burning near each other but the people were gone and had left some shells and bones of fish they had just eaten They likewise saw several pieces of soft bark about the length and breadth of a man which they judged had been used as beds This kind of encampment was in a thicket well defended from the wind and as the place was much trodden and there was no appearance of a house it was imagined that they spent their nights as well as days in the open air even Tupia shook his head and exclaimed  Taata Enos  "Poor wretches"  They sailed the next morning and on the day following were abreast of a point which lying immediately under the tropic the Captain called CAPE CAPRICORN on the west side of which they saw an amazing number of large birds resembling the pelican some of which were near five feet high  On the th they stood between a range of almost barren islands and the main land which is mountainous They had here very shallow water and anchored in sixteen feet which was not two feet more than the ship drew Mr Banks tried to fish from the cabin windows but the water was too shallow The ground indeed was covered with crabs which greedily seized the bait and held it till they were above water These crabs were of two kinds one of a very fine blue with a white belly and the other marked with blue on the joints and having three remarkable brown spots on the back The Captain having sent some men in a boat ahead to sound they returned with an account that there was not water enough for the ship to pass through upon which they tacked about and stood back again In the morning they sailed to the northward and to the northermost point of land the Captain gave the name of CAPE MANIFOLD from the number of high hills appearing above it Between this cape and the shore is a bay called KEPPEL'S BAY and some islands bearing the name of the same gentleman On the th being determined to keep the main land close aboard which continued to tend away to the west they got among another cluster of islands they were here again greatly alarmed having on a sudden but three fathom water in a ripling tide they immediately put the ship about and hoisted out the boats in  search of deeper water after which they stood to the west with an easy sail and in the evening came to the entrance of a bay On the th in the morning the master was sent with two boats to sound the bay and the ship was no sooner under sail than the boats made the signal and the ship accordingly came to an anchor As they observed the tide to flow and ebb considerably they imagined this bay to be the entrance of a river which ran up the country in this place therefore the Captain intended to lay the ship ashore and clean her bottom and accordingly landed in search of a proper place for the purpose  In this excursion Messrs Banks and Solander attended Captain Cook They found walking extremely incommodious the ground being covered with grass the seeds of which were sharp and bearded so that they were continually sticking in their cloaths whence they worked forwards to the flesh by means of the beard They were likewise tormented with the perpetual stinging of musquetos Several places were found convenient to lay the ship ashore but they could meet with no fresh water In the interior parts of the country they found gumtrees on the branches of which were white ants nests formed of clay as big as a bushel On another tree they found black ants which formed their lodging in the body of it after they had eaten away the pith yet the trees were  in a flourishing condition They found butterflies in such incredible numbers that whatever way they looked many thousands were to be seen in the air while every bough and twig was covered with multitudes They likewise discovered on dry ground where it was supposed to have been left by the tide a fish about the size of a minnow having two strong breast fins with which it leaped away as nimbly as a frog it did not appear to be weakened by being out of water nor even to prefer that element to the land for when seen in the water it leaped on shore and pursued its way It was likewise remarked that where there were small stones projecting above the water it chose rather to leap from one stone to another than to swim through the water  On the th the Captain went ashore very early and having gained the summit of a hill took a survey of the coast and adjacent islands which being done he accompanied Dr Solander up an inlet which had been discovered the preceding day but the weather proving unfavourable they returned early to the ship having seen only two Indians who followed the boat a considerable way along the shore but the tide running strong they did not think it prudent to wait for them This day Mr Banks went with a party on shore and having met with a piece of swampy ground covered with mangroves they resolved to pass it which  they did up to the knees in mud and sometimes crawling on their hands when they had slipt between the branches of trees which were interwoven on the surface of the swamp Having performed this disagreeable task they arrived at a spot where the natives appeared to have slept on the grass and where there were the remains of a fish supper which had been roasted by four small fires The second Lieutenant at another place saw the track of a large animal near a gully of water he likewise heard the voices of the Indians but did not see any Two turtles were seen at this place some waterfowl and a few small landbirds  As no water was to be found the Captain called the inlet THIRSTY SOUND which they left on the st of May and having sailed round three small islands anchored in fifteen fathom water On the st of June they got under sail having a number of islands in sight as far as the eye could reach On the second at noon they saw a high promontory which was called CAPE HILLSBOROUGH and seemed to abound in wood and herbage distributed on hills plains and in vallies There are a number of small islands in this neighbourhood on some of which they saw smoke arising in different places On Sunday the d they discovered a point which was named CAPE CONWAY and between that and Cape Hillssborough a bay which took the name of REPULSE BAY  The land about CAPE CONWAY is diversified by hills and dales lawns and woods and forms a delightfully verdant appearance By the help of their glasses they discovered three people on one of the islands and a canoe with an outrigger like those of Otaheite They this day named the islands CUMBERLAND ISLANDS in honour of the Duke and a passage which they discovered was called WITSUNDAY'S PASSAGE from the day on which it was seen At daybreak on Monday they were a breast of a point which took the name of CAPE GLOUCESTER Names were likewise this day given to three other places viz HOLBORNE ISLE EDGCUMBE BAY and CAPE UPSTART which latter was so called because it rises abruptly from the low lands that surround it  On Tuesday when near the shore they saw very large columns of smoke rising from the lowlands This day they gave name to CLEAVELAND BAY the east point of which was called CAPE CLEAVELAND and the west MAGNETICAL ISLE because the compass did not traverse well when they were near it The points as well as the main land within them lay high and form a barren rugged and rocky coast On the afternoon of Thursday they saw several large columns of smoke likewise some canoes and several natives with some trees that they thought were those of cocoanut in search of which fruit Messrs Banks and Solander went  ashore with Lieutenant Hicks but they returned in the evening with a few plants which they had gathered from the cabbage palm and which had been mistaken for the cocoatree On Friday they gave the name of POINT HILLOCK to a point of land between which and Magnetical Isle the shore forms HALIFAX BAY which affords shelter from all winds At six this evening they were abreast of a point of land which was named Cape Sandwich near which lies ROCKINGHAM BAY Hence they ranged northward along the shore towards a cluster of islands on one of which about forty men women and children were standing together and looking at the ship with a curiosity never observed among these people before The north point of Rockingham bay was called DUNK ISLE which is scarcely to be distinguished from the shore it lies so very near it On Saturday morning they were abreast of some small islands which were named FRANKLAND'S ISLES near which lie two places which were called CAPE GRAPTON and GREEN ISLAND Here Messrs Banks and Solander went ashore with the Captain whose chief view were to procure water which not being easily to be got they soon returned on board and the next day arrived near TRINITY BAY which was so called because it was discovered on Trinity Sunday  As no accident remarkably unfortunate had befallen our adventurers during a navigation of  more than thirteen hundred miles upon a coast every where abounding with the most dangerous rocks and shoals no name expressive of distress had hitherto been given to any cape or point of land which they had seen But they now gave the name of CAPE TRIBULATION to a point which they had just discovered as they here became acquainted with misfortune  This cape is in sixteen degrees six minutes south latitude and degrees minutes west longitude  At six in the evening they shortened sail to avoid the danger of some rocks which were seen a head and to observe whether any islands lay in the offing as they were now near the latitude of those islands said to have been discovered by Quiros They kept standing off from six o'clock till near nine with a fine breeze and bright moon They had got from fourteen into twentyone fathom water when suddenly they fell into twelve ten and eight fathom in a few minutes Every man was instantly ordered to his station and they were on the point of anchoring when on a sudden they had again deep water so that they thought all danger was at an end concluding they had sailed over the tail of some shoals which they had seen in the evening They had twenty fathom and upwards before ten o'clock and this depth continuing some time the gentlemen who had hitherto been upon deck retired to  rest but in less than an hour the water shallowed at once from twenty to seventeen fathom and before soundings could be again taken the ship struck against a rock and remained fixed but from the motion given her by the beating of the surge Every one was instantly on deck with countenances fully expressive of the agitation of their minds As they knew they were not near the shore they concluded they had struck against a rock of coral the points of which being sharp and the surface so rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed against it tho' with a gentle motion they had reason to dread the horror of their situation  The sails being taken in and boats hoisted out to examine the depth of water they found that the ship had been carried over a ledge of the rock and lay in a hollow within it Finding that the water was deepest eastern they carried out the anchor from the starboard quarter and applied their whole force to the capstern in hopes to get the vessel off but in vain She now beat so violently against the rock that the crew could scarcely keep on their legs The moon now shone bright by the light of which they could see the sheathing boards float from the bottom of the vessel till at length the false keel followed so that they expected instant destruction Their best chance of escaping seemed now to be by lightening her but as they had struck at high water they would  have been but in their present situation after the vessel should draw as much less water as the water had sunk but their anxiety abated a little on finding that the ship settled to the rocks as the tide ebbed They however flattered themselves that if the ship should keep together till next tide they might have some chance of floating her They therefore instantly started the water in the hold and pumped it up The decayed stores oil jars casks ballast six of their guns and other things were thrown overboard in order to get at the heavier articles and in this business they were employed till daybreak during all which time it was observed that not an oath was sworn so much were the minds of the sailors impressed with a sense of their danger  At daylight they saw land at eight leagues distance but not a single island between them and the main on which part of the crew might have been landed while the boat went on shore with the rest so that the destruction of the greater part of them would have been inevitable had the ship gone to pieces It happened however that the wind died away to a dead calm before noon As they expected high water at eleven o'clock every thing was prepared to make another effort to free the ship but the tide fell so much short of that in the night that she did not float by eighteen inches though they had thrown overboard near fifty tons  weight they now therefore renewed their toil and threw overboard every thing that could be possibly spared As the tide fell the water poured in so rapidly that they could scarcely keep her free by the constant working of two pumps Their only hope now depended on the midnight tide and preparations were accordingly made for another effort to get the ship off The tide began to rise at five o'clock when the leak likewise encreased to such a degree that two more pumps were manned but only one of them would work three therefore were kept going till nine o'clock at which time the ship righted but so much water had been admitted by the leak that they expected she would sink as soon as the water should bear her off the rock Their situation was now deplorable beyond description and the imagination must paint what would baffle the powers of language to describe They knew that when the fatal moment should arrive all authority would be at an end The boats were incapable of conveying them all on shore and they dreaded a contest for the preference as more shocking than the shipwreck itself yet it was considered that those who might be left on board would eventually meet with a milder fate than those who by gaining the shore would have no chance but to linger the remains of life among the rudest savages in the universe and in a country where  firearms would barely enable them to support a wretched existence  At twenty minutes after ten the ship floated and was heaved into deep water when they were happy to find that she did not admit more water than she had done before yet as the leak had for a considerable time gained on the pumps there was now three feet nine inches water in the hold By this time the men were so worn by fatigue of mind and body that none of them could pump more than five or six minutes at a time and then threw themselves quite spent on the deck amidst a stream of water which came from the pumps The succeeding man being fatigued in his turn threw himself down in the same manner while the former jumped up and renewed his labour thus mutually struggling for life till the following accident had like to have given them up a prey to absolute despair  Between the inside lining of the ship's bottom which is called the ceiling and the outside planking there is a space of about seventeen or eighteen inches The man who had hitherto taken the depth of water at the well had taken it no farther than the ceiling but being now relieved by another person who took the depth to the outside planking it appeared by this mistake that the leak had suddenly gained upon the pumps the whole difference between the two plankingsThis circumstance deprived them  of all hopes and scarce any one thought it worth while to labour for the longer preservation of a life which must so soon have a period but the mistake was soon discovered and the joy arising from such unexpected good news inspired the men with so much vigour that before eight o'clock in the morning they had pumped out considerably more water than they had shipped They now talked confidently of getting the ship into some harbour and set heartily to work to get in their anchors one of which and the cable of another they lost but these were now considered as trifles Having a good breeze from the sea they got under sail at eleven o'clock and stood for the land  As they could not discover the exact situation of the leak they had no prospect of stopping it within side of the vessel but the following expedient which one of the Midshipmen had formerly seen tried with success was adopted They took an old studding sail and having mixed a large quantity of oakham and wool chopped small it was stitched down in handfuls on the sail as lightly as possible the dung of their sheep and other filth being spread over it Thus prepared the sail was hauled under the ship by ropes which kept it extended till it came under the leak when the suction carried in the oakham and wool from the surface of the sail This experiment succeeded so well that  instead of three pumps the water was easily kept under with one  They had hitherto had no further view than to run the ship into an harbour and build a vessel from her materials in which they might reach the East Indies but they now began to think of finding a proper place to repair her damage and then to pursue their voyage on its original plan At six in the evening they anchored seven leagues from the shore and found that the ship made fifteen inches water an hour during the night but as the pumps could clear this quantity they were not uneasy At nine in the morning they passed two islands which were called HOPE ISLANDS because the reaching of them had been the object of their wishes at the time of the shipwreck In the afternoon the Master was sent out with two boats to sound and search for a harbour where the ship might be repaired They anchored at sunset in four fathom two miles from the shore One of the Mates being out in the pinnace returned at nine o'clock reporting that he had found just such a harbour as was wanted at the distance of two leagues  At six o'clock the next morning they sailed having previously sent two boats ahead to lie on the shoals that they saw in their way They soon anchored about a mile from the shore when the Captain went out and found the channel very narrow but the harbour was better  adapted to their present purpose than any place they had seen in the whole course of their voyage As it blew very fresh this day and the following night they could not venture to run into the harbour but remained at anchor during the two succeeding days in the course of which they observed four Indians on the hills who stopped and made two fires  The men by this time began to be afflicted with the scurvy and their Indian friend Tupia was so bad with it that he had livid spots on both his legs Mr Green the astronomer was likewise ill of the same disorder so that their being detained from landing was every way disagreeable The wind continued fresh till Sunday the th but they then resolved to push in for the harbour and twice ran the ship aground the second time of which she stuck fast on which they took the booms foreyard and fore topmasts down and made a raft on the side of the ship and as the tide happened to be rising she floated at one o'clock She was now soon got into the harbour where she was moored along the side of a beach and the anchors cables c immediately taken out of her  On Monday morning they erected a tent for the sick several of whom were brought on shore as soon as it was ready for their reception They likewise built a tent to hold the provisions and stores which were landed the same day  The boat was now dispatched in search of fish for the refreshment of the sick but she returned without getting any but Tupia employed himself in angling and living entirely on the produce of his industry recovered his health very fast Mr Banks in an excursion up the country saw the frames of several Indian houses which appeared to have been abandoned some time while the Captain having ascended one of the highest hills observed the high land to be stoney and barren and the low land near the river overrun with mangroves among which the saltwater flowed every tide  On Tuesday the Captain ordered the smith's forge to be set up and directed the armourer to prepare the necessary iron work for the repair of the vessel He likewise ordered out the officers stores water c in order to lighten the ship This day Mr Banks crossed the river to view the country which was little else than sandhills He saw vast flocks of crows and pigeons of the latter of which he shot several which were most beautiful birds On the day following as they were removing the coals the water rushed in near the foremast about three feet from the keel so that it was resolved to clear the hold entirely wherefore they took out all the coals and the next day warped the ship higher up the harbour to a station proper for laying her ashore in order to stop the leak  Early in the morning of the d the tide left the ship and they proceeded to examine the leak when they found that the rocks had cut through four planks into the timbers and that three other planks were damaged In these breaches not a splinter was to be seen the whole being smooth as if cut away by an instrument but the preservation of the vessel was owing to a very singular circumstance One of the holes was large enough to have sunk her even with eight pumps constantly at work but this hole was in a great measure stopped up by the fragment of the rock being left sticking in it They likewise found some pieces of the oakham wool c which had got between the timbers and stopped many parts of the leak which had been left open by the stone Exclusive of the leak great damage was done to various parts of the ship's bottom  While the smiths were engaged in making nails and bolts the carpenters began to work on the vessel and some of the crew were sent across the river to shoot pigeons for the sick These people found a stream of fresh water discovered many Indian houses and had sight of a mousecoloured animal extremely swift and about the size of a greyhound On the d they saw plenty of fish but catched only three This day many of the crew saw the animal abovementioned and one of the seamen declared he had seen the Devil which he described  in the following words  "He was as large says he as a one gallon keg and very like it he had horns and wings yet he crept so slowly through the grass that if I had not been  afeard  I might have touched him"  It appeared afterwards that this poor fellow had seen a bat which is almost black and as large as a partridge and his own apprehensions had furnished his Devil with horns  The repairs on the starboard side having been finished the preceding day the carpenters began to work under the larboard bow on Sunday the thThis day Mr Gore and a party procured a bunch or two of wild plantains and a few palm cabbages for the refreshment of the sick and the Captain and Mr Banks saw the animal abovementioned which had a long tail that it carried like a greyhound it leapt like a deer and the point of its foot resembled that of a goat  The ship was now examined abaft when it was discovered that she had received but little injury in that quarter The carpenters continued to work on her whenever the tide would permit The vessel was now in a position which threw all the water abaft and Mr Banks having removed his whole collection of plants into the breadroom they were this day found under water by which some of them were totally destroyed but by great care most of them were restored to a state of preservation  The ship being in part repaired they twice attempted to float her by lashing a number of casks under her bottom but their endeavours proving fruitless they were obliged to wait for the next spring tide This day a plant was found the leaves of which were almost as good as spinnage They likewise found more cabbage trees some wild plantain and a fruit of a deep purple colour and the size of a golden pippin which after being kept a few days tasted like a damson  The carpenter was now engaged in caulking the ship and the men employed in filling water and other necessary business while the Captain amused himself in catching fish for the sick On the th Mr Banks took some of the crew up the country to shew them a plant which served them for greens and which the inhabitants of the West Indies call Indian kale Here they saw a tree notched for climbing in the same way as those seen in Botany bay They also met with nests of white ants from a few inches to five feet in height Mr Gore was up the country where he saw prints of the feet of men and the tracks of three or four kinds of animals  On the day following the boat took as many fish as allowed a pound and an half to each man A Midshipman saw a wolf exactly resembling those of America On the th the Captain ascended a hill to take a view of the  sea when to his great concern he observed innumerable sandbanks and shoals in every direction but there was an appearance of a passage to the northward the only way he could think of getting clear as the wind constantly blows from the southeast Mr Gore this day saw two strawcoloured animals of the size of a hare but shaped like a dog So much fish was taken that each man had two pounds and a half and plenty of greens were gathered which being boiled with the pease their fare was deemed excellent  On Sunday July the st all the men had permission to go on shore except one from each mess who went on the fishing party and again met with great success A fire was this day observed about a mile up the river The master having been sent in the pinnace in search of a channel returned on Tuesday with an account that he had found a passage out to sea between the shoals which consisted of coral rocks many of which were left dry at low water He found some cockles so large that one of them was more than sufficient for two men and likewise plenty of other shellfish of which he brought a supply to the ship in his return to which he had landed in a bay where some Indians were at supper but they instantly fled leaving some seaeggs and a fire for the dressing them This day they succeeded in an attempt to float the ship when they found that  by the position she had lain in she had sprung a plank so that it was again necessary to lay her ashore An alligator swam by her several times this day  On the th she was laid ashore on a sandbank and the next day floated at high water and moored off the beach in order to receive the stores on board This day Mr Banks crossed the harbour and found on a sandy beach a great number of fruits such as they had not seen before among which was a cocoanut which Tupia said had been opened by a crab and which was judged to be what the Dutch call  Beurs Krabbe  The vegetable substances which Mr Banks picked up were encrusted with marine productions which is said to be a proof of their having been brought far by sea  Mr Banks and a party having taken a boat up the river on the th with a view to make an excursion in the country returned on the thThey examined some parts of the country which differing but little from what they had already seen they followed the course of the river which they at length found contracted into a narrow channel bounded by steep banks which were adorned with trees of a most beautiful appearance among which was the barktree The land was low and covered with grass and seemed capable of being cultivated to great advantage They saw several animals one of which was judged to be a wolf  At night they made a fire and took up their quarters on the banks of the river but the night was rendered extremely disagreeable by the stings of the musquitos which pursued them into the smoke and almost into the fire At break of day they sat out in search of game and saw four animals two of which were chaced by Mr Banks's greyhound but they greatly outstripped him in speed by leaping over the long thick grass which incommoded the dog in running It was observed of this animal that he leaped or bounded forward on two legs instead of running on four Having returned to the boat they proceeded up the river till it contracted to a brook of fresh water but in which the tide still rose considerably When they stopped for the night they saw a smoke at a small distance on which three of them approached it but the Indians were gone They saw the impression of feet on the sand below highwater mark and found a fire still burning in the hollow of an old tree At a small distance they saw several huts and observed ovens dug in the ground the remains of a recent meal were likewise apparent They now retired to their restingplace and slept on plantainleaves with bunches of grass for their pillows on the side of a sandbank under the shelter of a bush  The tide favouring their return in the morning they lost no time in getting back to the  ship The master who had been seven leagues at sea returned soon after Mr Banks bringing with him three turtle which he took with a boathook and which together weighed near eight hundred pounds He was sent out next morning and Mr Banks accompanied him with proper instruments for catching turtle but not being successful he would not go back that night so that Mr Banks after collecting some shells and marine productions returned in his own small boat  In the morning the second Lieutenant was sent to bring the Master back soon after which four Indians in a small canoe were within sight The Captain now determined to take no notice of these people as the most likely way to be noticed by them This project answered two of them came within musketshot of the vessel where they conversed very loud in return the people on board shouted and made signs of invitation The Indians gradually approached with their lances held up not in a menacing manner but as if they meant to intimate they were capable of defending themselves They came almost alongside when the Captain threw them cloth nails paper c which did not seem to attract their notice At length one of the sailors threw them a small fish which so pleased them that they hinted their design of bringing their companions and immediately rowed for the shore In the interim Tupia  and some of the crew landed on the opposite shore The four Indians now came quite alongside the ship and having received farther presents landed where Tupia and the sailors had gone They had each two lances and a stick with which they throw them Advancing towards the English Tupia persuaded them to lay down their arms and sit by him which they readily did Others of the crew now going ashore the Indians seemed jealous least they should get between them and their arms but care was taken to convince them that no such thing was intended and more trifles were presented to them The crew staid with them till dinnertime and then made signs of invitation for them to go to the ship and eat but this they declined and retired in their canoe  These men were of the common stature with very small limbs their complexion a deep chocolate their hair black either lank or curled but not of the wool kind the breast and upper lip of one of them were painted with streaks of white which he called  Carbanda  and some parts of their bodies had been painted red Their teeth were white and even their eyes bright and their features rather pleasing their voices were musical and they repeated several English words with great readiness  The visit of three of these Indians was renewed the next morning and they brought with them a fourth whom they called YAPARICO  who appeared to be a person of some consequence The bone of a bird about six inches long was thrust through the gristle of his nose and indeed all the inhabitants of this place had their noses bored for the reception of such an ornament These people being all naked the Captain gave one of them an old shirt which he bound round his head like a turban instead of using it to cover any part of his body They brought a fish to the ship which was supposed to be in payment for that given them the preceding day after staying some time with apparent satisfaction they suddenly leaped into their canoe and rowed off from a jealousy of some of the gentlemen who were examining it  Three Indians visited Tupia's tent on the th of July and after remaining some time one of them went for two others whom he introduced by name Some fish was offered them but they seemed not much to regard it and after eating a little gave the remainder to Mr Banks's dog Some ribbands which had been given them to which medals were suspended round their necks were so changed by smoke that it was difficult to judge what colour they had been and the smoke had made their skins look darker than their natural colour from whence it was thought that they slept close to their fires as a preventative against the sting of the musquitos Both the strangers had bones  through their noses and a piece of bark tied over the forehead and one of them had an ornament of strings round his arm and an elegant necklace made of shells Their canoe was about ten feet long and calculated to hold four persons and when it was in shallow water they moved it by means of poles Their lances had only a single point and some of them were barbed with fishbones On the th Mr Gore shot one of the mousecoloured animals abovementioned It chanced to be a young one weighing no more than thirtyeight pounds but when full grown they are as large as a sheep The skin of this beast which is called  Kanguroo  is covered with short fur and is of a dark mousecolour the head and ears are somewhat like those of a hare this animal was dressed for dinner and proved fine eating The ship's crew fed on turtle almost every day which were finer than those eaten in England owing to their being killed before their natural fat was wasted and their juices changed  On the th Messrs Banks and Solander went with the Captain into the woods and saw four Indians in a canoe who went on shore and walked up without sign of fear They accepted some beads and departed intimating that they did not chuse to be followed The natives being now become familiar with the ship's crew one of them was desired to  throw his lance which he did with such dexterity and force that though it was not above four feet from the ground at the highest it penetrated deeply into a tree at the distance of fifty yards The natives now went on board the ship and were well pleased with their entertainment On the th they saw several of the women who as well as the men were quite naked They were this day visited by ten of the natives who seemed resolved to have one of the turtle that was on board which they repeatedly made signs for and being as repeatedly refused they expressed the utmost rage and resentment and one of them in particular having received a denial from Mr Banks he stamped and pushed him away in the most violent manner At length they laid hands on two of the turtles and drew them to the side of the ship where their canoe lay but the sailors took them away They made several similar attempts but being equally unsuccessful they leaped suddenly into their canoe and rowed off At this instant the Captain with Mr Banks and five or six seamen went ashore where they arrived before the Indians and where many of the crew were already employed As soon as the Indians landed one of them snatched a firebrand from under a pitch kettle and running to the windward of what effects were on shore set fire to the dry grass which burnt rapidly scorched a pig to  death burnt part of the smith's forge and would have destroyed a tent of Mr Banks's but that some people came from the ship just in time to get it out of the way of the flames In the interim the Indians went to a place where the fishing nets lay and a quantity of linen was laid out to dry and there again set fire to the grass in spite of all persuasion and even of threats A musket loaded with small shot was now fired and one of them being wounded they ran away and this second fire was easily extinguished but the other burnt far into the woods  The natives continuing still in sight a musquet charged with ball was fired near them upon hearing which they soon got out of sight but their voices being soon heard in the woods and seeming to come nearer the Captain with a few people went to meet them When they were in sight of each other both parties stopped except an old Indian who advanced before the rest a little way but soon halted and speaking a few words retreated to his brethren and they all retired slowly together The English having seized some of their darts followed them about a mile and then sat down the Indians sitting about an hundred yards from them The old man again came forward having in his hand a lance with a point He stopped and spoke several times on which the Captain made signs of friendship The old Indian now  turned to his companions and having spoken to them they placed their lances against a tree and came forward as in friendship whereupon their darts which had been taken were returned and the whole quarrel seemed to be at an end The Indians having accepted some trinkets walked amicably toward the coast intimating by signs that they would not fire the grass again They sat down opposite the ship but would not go on board and they accepted a few musquetballs the use and effect of which the Captain endeavoured to explain to them When Captain Cook got on board he saw the woods burning at the distance of two miles  The master having been sent to search for a passage to the northward returned with an account that he could not find any By the night of the th the fire had extended many miles round them on the hills which at night formed an appearance that was very striking On the d they killed a turtle through both shoulders of which stuck a wooden harpoon which the Indians had striken it with and the wound was quite healed The next day one of the seamen who had strayed from his company met with four Indians at dinner he was alarmed at this unexpected meeting but had prudence enough to conceal his apprehensions and sitting down by them gave them his knife which having all looked at they returned he would then have left them but they chose to detain him till by  feeling his hands and face they were convinced he was made of flesh and blood like themselves they then dismissed him directing him the nearest way to the ship  Mr Banks having gone on shore in search of plants found the cloth which had been distributed among the natives lying in a heap as a commodity of no value On the th Messrs Solander and Banks found several marking nuts the  Anacardium orientale  on the ground but their search for the tree that bore them was fruitless On the th Mr Banks catched a female animal called the  Opossum  with two young ones  By the th the ship was ready for sea but there was not water sufficient for her to pass the bar On the first of August they found that their pumps were all rotten but as the ship admitted only an inch of water in an hour they hoped she would be stout enough to bear the voyage On the th of this month they put to sea the pinnace going ahead to keep sounding and at noon came to an anchor when the Captain gave the name of CAPE BEDFORD to the northermost point of land in sight and that of ENDEAVOUR RIVER to the harbour which they had quitted  The provisions they obtained while in this harbour consisted of turtle which they went some miles to sea to catch oysters of three different sorts large cavalhe or scomber large  mullets some flat fish a great number of small scombri and skate or ray fish purslain wild beans the tops of coccos and cabbage palms Of quadrupedes there are goats wolves and polecats and a spotted animal of the viverra kind and several kinds of serpents only some of which are venomous Dogs are the only tame animals the landfowls are kites crows hawks loriquets cockatoos parrots pigeons and small birds of various kinds the names of which were not known the waterfowls are wild geese curlieus hens whistling ducks which perch on trees and some few others The soil produces the gum tree and various other kinds of wood and coarse grass the whole of the country is well watered and ant hills abound in every part of it  On the th the Captain ascended to the masthead to look at some shoals which threatened great danger and he saw several of them above the water This day such a quantity of fish was catched as allowed a dividend of two pounds to each man During the six following days they struggled incessantly to sail safely past the shoals and breakers by which they were every way surrounded but for the present their attempts were vain On the th they were between a headland and three islands which had been discovered on the preceding day and began to conceive hopes that they were out of danger but this not proving the case the headland  received the name of CAPE FLATTERY Some land was now seen from the masthead which was generally taken for the main but the Captain judged it to be a cluster of islands and during this diversity of opinion the ship came to an anchor The Captain now landed and ascending a high point took a survey of the sea coast by which he was confirmed in his opinion that what they had seen was not any part of the main but a number of islands On the point where he stood were seen the prints of human feet in white sand of an exquisite fineness and the spot was denominated POINT LOOKOUT  Early on the th Mr Banks and the Captain went to visit the largest of three islands which had been seen from the point the preceding day Having gained the summit of the highest hill they beheld a reef of rocks on which the sea broke in a frightful manner but the thickness of the weather preventing a perfect view they lodged under a bush during the night in the hope of having a better prospect in the morning but the weather then proved worse than it had been on the preceding day yet as they saw what had the appearance of a channel between the reefs a person was sent to examine it who found it very narrow They now set out to return to the ship after giving the name of LIZARD ISLAND to this place  from their having seen no animals but lizards on it  On their return they landed on a low sandy island which abounded in birds of various kinds among which were eagles a nest of the young of which they took and called the place EAGLE ISLAND On this spot they saw the nest of some bird which was built with sticks on the ground it was near three feet in height and twentysix round  During the interval of their absence from the ship the master had landed on several low islands where he had seen great heaps of turtle shells and found the fins of them which the Indians had left hanging on the trees so fresh that they were dressed and eaten by the boat's crew  After a conversation held among the officers it was their concurrent opinion that it would be best to leave the coast and stand out to sea and in consequence of these sentiments they sailed on the th of August and got through one of the channels in the reef happy to be once more in an open sea after having been surrounded by dreadful shoals and rocks for near three months They had now sailed above a thousand miles during all which run they had been obliged to keep sounding without the intermission of a single minute a circumstance which it is supposed never happened to any ship but the Endeavour  The islands from one of which the passage to the open sea had been observed were called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION They abound in turtle and other fish and on the beach were found bamboos cocoanuts pumicestone and the seeds of plants which were supposed to be carried thither by the trade winds as the plants themselves do not grow in the country  Having anchored on the th they steered a westerly course on the following day to get sight of the land that a passage between that land and New Guinea might not be missed if there was any such passage Early in the afternoon they had sight of land which had the appearance of hilly islands but it was judged to be a part of the main and they saw breakers between the vessel and the land in which was an opening to get clear of which they set all their sails and stood to the northward till midnight and then went on a southward tack for about two miles when the breeze died away to a dead calm When daylight came on they saw a dreadful surf break at a vast height within a mile of the ship towards which the rolling waves carried her with great rapidity Thus distressed the boats were sent ahead to tow and the head of the vessel was brought about but not till she was within one hundred yards of the rock between which and her there was nothing left but the chasm made by the last wave which had washed her side and which had risen and  broke to a wonderful height on the rockbut in the moment they expected instant destruction a breeze hardly discernible aided the boats in getting the vessel in an oblique direction from the rock The hopes however afforded by this providential circumstance were destroyed by a perfect calm which succeeded in a few minutes yet the breeze once more returned before they had lost the little ground which had been gained  At this time a small opening was seen in the reef and a young officer being sent to examine it found that its breadth did not much exceed the length of the ship but that there was smooth water on the other side of the rocks Animated by the hope of preserving life they now attempted to pass the opening but this was impossible for it having become high water in the interim the ebb tide rushed through it with amazing impetuosity carrying the ship about a quarter of a mile from the reef and she soon reached the distance of near two miles by the help of the boats When the ebb tide was spent the tide of flood again drove the vessel very near the rocks so that their prospect of destruction was renewed when they discovered another opening and a light breeze springing up they entered it and were driven through it with a rapidity that prevented the ship from striking against either side of the channel The ship now came to an anchor and her crew were  grateful for having regained a station which they had been very lately most anxious to quit  The name of PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL was given to the opening through which the ship had thus escaped the most imminent dangers A high promontory on the main land in sight was denominated CAPE WEYMOUTH and a bay near it WEYMOUTH BAY This day the boats went out to fish and met with great success particularly in catching cockles some of which were of such an amazing size as to require the strength of two men to move them Mr Banks likewise succeeded in his search for rare shells and different kinds of coral  On the th they discovered several small islands which were called FORBES'S ISLANDS and had sight of a high point of land on the main which was named the BOLT HEAD On the th they discovered several other small islands the land of which was low barren and sandy A point was seen and called CAPE GRENVILLE and a bay which took the name of TEMPLE BAY In the afternoon many other islands were seen which were denominated BIRD ISLES from their being frequented by numerous flocks of birds  On the th many more small islands were seen on one of which there were a few trees and many Indian huts supposed to have been erected by the natives of the main land as temporary habitations during their visits to these  islands On the st they sailed through a channel in which was a number of shoals and gave the name of YORK CAPE to a point of the main land which forms the side of the channel A large bay is formed to the south of the cape which was called NEWCASTLE BAY and in which are several little islands On the north side of the cape the land is rather mountainous but the low parts of the country abound with trees The islands discovered in the morning of this day were called YORK ISLES In the afternoon they anchored between some islands and observed that the channel now began to grow wider they observed two distant points between which no land could be seen so that the hope of having at length explored a passage into the Indian sea began to animate every breast but to bring the matter nearer to a certainty the Captain took a party and being accompanied by Messrs Solander and Banks they landed on an island on which they had seen a number of Indians ten of whom were on a hill one of them carrying a bow and a bundle of arrows the rest armed with lances and round the necks of two of them hung strings of motherofpearl Three of these Indians stood on the shore as if to oppose the landing of the boat but they retired before it reached the beach  The Captain and his company now ascended a hill from whence they had a view of near  forty miles in which space there was nothing that threatened to oppose their passage so that the certainty of a channel seemed to be almost ascertained Previous to their leaving the island Captain Cook displayed the English colours and took possession of all the eastern coast of the country from the th degree of southlatitude to the present spot by the name of NEW SOUTH WALES for his Sovereign the King of Great Britain and three vollies of small arms being fired and answered by an equal number from the  Endeavour  the place received the name of POSSESSION ISLAND  The next morning they saw three naked women collecting shellfish on the beach and weighing anchor gave the name of CAPE CORNWALL to the extreme point of the largest island on the northwest side of the passage some low islands near the middle of the channel receiving the name of WALLIS'S ISLES soon after which the ship came to an anchor and the longboat was sent out to found  Towards evening they sailed again and the Captain landed with Mr Banks on a small island which was frequented by immense numbers of birds the majority of which being boobies the place received the name of BOOBY ISLAND They were now advanced to the northern extremity of New Holland and had the satisfaction of viewing the open sea to the westward The northeast entrance of the passage  is formed by the main land of New Holland and by a number of islands which took the name of the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLANDS and which Captain Cook imagines may reach to New Guinea these islands abound with trees and grass and were known to be inhabited from the smoke that was seen ascending in many places  To the passage which they had sailed through Captain Cock gave the name of ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS we shall now proceed to a more accurate description of the country they had discovered with an account of its productions and of the manners and language of its inhabitants  New South Wales is a much larger country than any hitherto known which is not deemed a continent being larger than all Europe which is proved by the Endeavour having coasted more than two thousand miles even if her tract was reduced to a strait line Northward of the latitude of thirtythree degrees the country is hilly but not mountainous but to the southward of that latitude it is mostly low and even ground The hills in general are diversified by lawns and woods and many of the vallies abound with herbage though on the whole it cannot be deemed a fertile country To the northward the grass is not so rich nor the trees so high as in the southern parts and almost every where even the largest trees grow  at a distance of not less than thirteen yards asunder In all those places where the land forms a bay the shore is covered with mangroves which grow about a mile inland in a stinking ground which the spring tides always overflow In some parts there are bogs covered with thick grass and there is plenty of underwood in the vallies the soil in general seems unfit for cultivation though there are many spots where the arts of tillage might be attended with success  Salt creeks run in many directions through the country which likewise abounds in springs and brooks of fresh water but has no rivers of any considerable size yet it is supposed to be upon the whole well watered as the time when the ship was on the coast was the driest season of the year All parts of the country produce the gum tree which yields a resin like the  sanguis draconis    There are palmtrees of three kinds two of which are found only in the northern district One of these produces nuts resembling chesnuts the hulls of which being sound near where the natives had made fires it was supposed that they were eatable but some of the seamen having eaten of them were taken very ill upon which they were given to the hogs but two of these died in about a week and it was a work of difficulty to recover the rest The second sort of palm is much like the true cabbage tree  of the West Indies and yields a large cabbage of a tolerable flavour The third sort which abounds in the southward parts produces a small cabbage of the most agreeable taste and its nuts which are fine food for hogs grow in the greatest abundance This country also produces a tree on which grows a kind of purple apple which tastes like a damascen after keeping it a few daysa figtree the fruit of which tastes very indifferentlyand a tree the fruit of which is flat on the sides like a cheese but its colour is that of a plumb  Among the plants there is one the leaves of which are like those of the bulrush which yeilds a bright yellow resin exactly like gambouge but it does not stain this plant had a very agreeable smell but it is not known to what uses it might be applied There are two kinds of yams one round and covered with stringy fibres and the other shaped like a radish but both of them are pleasant to the taste besides these the country produces purslain and a kind of wild parsley A fruit of a bad taste was found which resembled a pineapple and another the kernel of which was soft but it was otherwise like a cherry  Besides the quadrupedes already mentioned there is one the belly of which is totally white and the back brown with white spots it is much like a polecat and the Indians call it  Quoll  There are vast numbers of beautiful  pigeons many of which were shot by the seamen and the other landbirds are eagles hawks cranes herons bustards crows quails doves parrots paroquets cockatoos and some other birds of very elegant plumage  The insects are few in number among which the musquito and the ant are the chief The ants are of four kinds The first are perfectly green and live on trees in which they build curious nests by bending down the leaves and gluing them together with an animal juice thousands of them joined to keep the leaf in its proper position while many others were employed in the gluing them Being disturbed in their work the leaves which are four or five inches in breadth flew back with a force which was thought much superior to the united strength of these insects Those who disturbed them paid for their curiosity by being stung in a very severe manner  The second kind of ants are quite black and live in the inside of the branches of trees after they have worked out the pith Some of the branches being gathered millions of these animals issued from every broken twig  The third sort took up their lodging in the root of a plant that twines round the trunk of other trees This root which they hollowed for their purpose was cut into great numbers of passages which ran across each other yet the plant appeared not to have been injured  These were not more than half the size of the red ant of this country but upon being disturbed they crawled over the body in thousands and put their disturbers to the pain arising from exquisite tickling  The fourth kind were like the white ants of the East Indies and had one sort of nests as big as an half peck loaf hanging from the boughs of the trees and composed of several minute parts of vegetables stuck together by a glutinous matter supposed to have been supplied from their own bodies The cells had a communication with each other and had openings which led to other nests on the same tree they had likewise a hollow covered passage to another nest on the ground at the root of a different tree from that on which the former nest was suspended The ground nests are six feet in height and almost as much in breadth the outside being plaistered with clay of near two inches in thickness these have a subterraneous passage to the roots of the trees near which they stand from whence the ants ascend by covered ways up the trunk and branches As these groundbuilt houses are proof against the invasion of the rain it is supposed that the ants retire to them during the wet season  The seas in these parts produce variety and plenty of fish among which are mullets seacrayfish and crabs On the shoals are found the rock pearl and other oysters and the most  delicate green turtle besides those enormous cockles which have been already mentioned Alligators are found in the rivers and salt creeks  This country does not appear to be inhabited by numbers any way proportioned to its great extent not above thirty being ever seen together but once which was when those of both sexes and all ages got together on a rock off Botanybay to view the ship None of their villages consisted of more huts than would afford shelter for fourteen or fifteen men and these were the largest numbers that ever assembled with a view to attack the English No part of the country appeared to be cultivated whence there must necessarily be fewer inhabitants inland than on the sea coast  The men are well made of the middle size and active in a high degree but their voices are sort even to effeminacy Their colour is the chocolate but they were so covered with dirt as to look almost as black as negroes Their hair is naturally long and black but they commonly crop it short in some few instances it is slightly curled but in common quite strait It is always matted with dirt yet wholly free from lice their beards are thick and bushy but kept short by singing The women were seen only at a distance as the men constantly left them behind when they crossed the river  The chief ornament of these people is the bone that is thrust through the nose which  the sailors whimsically termed their spritsail yard but besides this they wore necklaces formed of shells a small cord tied twice or thrice round the arm between the elbow and the shoulder and a string of plaited human hair round the waist Some few of them had an ornament of shells hanging across the breast Besides these ornaments they painted their bodies and limbs white and red in stripes of different dimensions and they had a circle of white round each eye and spots of it on the face Their ears were bored but they did not wear earrings  These people accepted whatever was given them but seemed to have no idea of making an adequate return and they would not part with their ornaments for any thing that was offered in exchange Their bodies were marked with scars which they signified were in remembrance of the deceased  Their huts were built with small rods the two ends of which were fixed into the ground so as to form the figure of an oven they are covered with pieces of bark and palmleaves The door of this building which is only high enough to sit upright in is opposite to the fireplace they sleep with their heels turned up towards their heads and even in this posture the hut will not hold more than four people In the northern parts where the weather was warmer one side of the houses was left open and the  other opposed to whatever wind might blow at the time▪ these huts were only built for temporary use and left behind when they removed to other parts of the country but  th  ir stay was only for a night or two they had no other protection from the weather than what the grass and bushes afforded While the huts on the main land were turned from the wind those on the islands were turned towards it a kind of proof that they visit the islands in fine weather and enjoy the refreshing breeze while they sleep  These huts are furnished with a kind of bucket for fetching water made of an oblong piece of bark tied up at each end with the twig of a tree and this is the only furniture of the house On their backs they have a kind of ba  of the size and form of a cabbage  in which they carry the  r fish hooks and  es the  lls of which they make these hooks the ornaments which they wear some points of darts and two or three  of paint and in this narrow compass lies all their  hes  They feed on the kangaroo and on several kinds of birds when they can catch them they likewise eat ya  s and various kinds of fruit but the principal  le of their subsist+ence is fish They were frequently observed with the leaves of a  in the  r mouths but whether it had the qualities either of tobacco or  tle could not be known but it was observed not to discolour the teeth or l  p    The natives of New South Wales make use of spears or lances but these are very differently constructed those that were seen in the southern parts of the country had four prongs pointed with bone and barbed and the points were rubbed with a hard kind of wax the smoothness of which made an easier passage into what was struck by them On the contrary the lances in the northern parts have only one point the shafts of them are of different lengths from eight to fourteen feet are made of the stalk of a plant not unlike a bulrush and consist of several joints let into each other and tied together The points of these lances are sometimes made of fishbones and sometimes of a hard heavy wood they are barbed with other pieces of wood or bone so that when they have entered any depth into the body they cannot be drawn out without tearing the flesh in a shocking manner or leaving splinters behind them  When the natives intend to wound at a considerable distance they discharge this instrument with a throwingstick but if the object be near them it is thrown from the hand only The throwingstick is a piece of smooth hard red wood half an inch thick two inches broad and about three feet in length having a cross piece near four inches long at one end and a small knob at the other A small hollow is made in the shaft of the lance near the point  and in this hollow the knob is received but on being forced forward it will easily slip from it The lance being placed on this throwingstick the Indian holds it over his shoulder shakes it and then throws both lance and stick with his utmost power but as the cross piece strikes the shoulder the sudden jerk stops the stick while the lance is driven forward with amazing rapidity and is generally so well aimed that a mark at the distance of fifty yards is more certainly struck with it than by a bullet from a gun  These people make use of shields made of the bark of trees of about eighteen inches broad and three feet long Many trees were seen from whence the bark had been taken and others on which the shields were cut out but not taken away  In the northern parts of this coast the canoes are formed by hollowing out the trunk of a tree and it was conjectured that this operation must have been performed by fire as the natives did not appear to have any instrument proper for the purpose The canoes are in length about fou  teen feet and so narrow that they would be frequently overset but that they are provided with an o  ger The natives row them with paddles using both hands in that  ployment  The canoes in the southern parts are formed only of a piece of bark four yards long fastened  together at each end and the middle kept open by pieces of wood passing from side to side In deep water these are rowed by paddles of about a foot and a half in length the rower having one in each hand but in shallow water they are pushed forward by means of a long stick As these vessels are extremely light and draw very little water the natives run them on the mud banks in search of shellfish some of which it is probable they broil and eat as soon as they are taken as it was remarked that in the center of these vessels there was usually a fire burning on a quantity of seaweed  The natives have no tools but a wooden mallet a kind of wedge and an adze made of stone with some pieces of coral and shells which may possibly be applied to the purposes of cutting They polish the points of their lances and their throwingsticks with the leaves of a tree that appears to be the ficus riduola or wild fig which bites with a sharpness almost equal to that of a rasp  Four people is the greatest number that a canoe will contain and when more than this number were to pass a river three were landed out of the first freight and one man went back  r the rest  That the natives of this country sometimes  ge war with each other is evident from their being possessed of shields and weapons yet  ot a single wound was seen on any of their bodies  and if they are neither destroyed in war nor carried off by famine it will be difficult to form a judgment by what means the number of the inhabitants are so reduced as to subsist on the products of the country after all it will perhaps be best to attribute this circumstance to the wisdom of that Providence which distributes all its blessings with the most unbounded goodness and the most consummate wisdom  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME
