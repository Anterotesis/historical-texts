 Britannia Triumphans  OR THE EMPIRE Sav`d AND  EUROPE  Deliver'd BY THE Success of her Majesty's Forces under the Wise and Heroick Conduct of his Grace the DUKE of MARLBOROUGH  A POEM By Mr  Dennis  Ab Jove Principium Musae  Virg  LONDON  Printed for  J Nutt  near  StationersHall    To Her Most Sacred Majesty ANNE  Queen of  Great Britain France  and  Ireland  The True Defender of the Protestant Faith  The Great Supporter of the Liberties of  Europe  The Illustrious Maintainer of the Honour of the  English  Nation and  The Victorious Asserter of the Empire of the Ocean  THE FOLLOWING POEM  That it may live with the Immortality of Her Renown is with all Humility Dedicated by Her  Most Humble most Faithful and most Dutiful Subject and Servant JOHN DENNIS  PREFACE  I  Must confess I cannot in the Beginning of this Preface bespeak the Reader's good Opinion by informing him that I was put upon the following Work by the Command of some great Man who has Pow'r and Interest My Friends can bear me witness that I wanted no such Incitement That as soon as ever I heard of the Victory I resolv'd upon writing the Verses And though my Interest at that time as all who know me know very well extreamly requir'd that I should do something else yet it was enough for me that I look'd upon my self to be oblig'd to do this by the Duty which I owe to the Publick which I have always preferr'd before my Interest Thus I quickly came to a Resolution of writing the following Verses but as to the Form and the Manner of them I remain'd something doubtful till I was determined by her Majesty's Proclamation for a general Thanksgiving And that joyn'd to the Consideration of reducing some former critical Speculations into Practice made me resolve as far I was able to make the following Verses turn upon Religion My Design  when I began them was to publish them upon the th of  September  but besides that ill Health intervening caus'd Delay I soon found to my Sorrow that a Poem is not so easily compos'd as a Prayer  If the following Poem has any Degree of Force or Elevation in it the judicious Reader will easily discern that it owes them in a great measure to the Religion which is mingled with it for Religion as I have formerly prov'd is the best and most solid Foundation of a great and lofty Spirit in Poetry  If any one objects that the Religion is double in the following Poem he will find upon a more strict Enquiry that he is mistaken For tho' I have made the  Danube  a Person that is not making him a Heathen God  David  has done the same thing by  Jordan  and  Deborah  by  Kishon  I resolv'd to make the Religion that is mingled with the following Verses as Poetical as I could without making it Pagan Though  Fame  is call'd a Goddess there I by no means design the Goddess of the Ancient Poets but an Angel or Celestial Spirit For which I have the Authority of  Milton  who in the seventh Book of his Poem by  Urania  does not mean the Heathen Muse tho' he calls her Goddess but an Angel or Celestial Spirit And he there makes a second Invocation which is addrest to her after he has invok'd God himself in the Beginning of his Poem 'Tis true indeed Angels have been always painted Masculine but without either any sufficient Reason or divine Authority If they have Bodies I see no Reason why they mayn't be of both Sexes If they have none I cannot imagine how they can be of  either But a Poet who must of Necessity give them Bodies before they can be proper Machines for him since he gives them the Beauty of Women may very well give them the Sex too  The following Verses were written without Rime which I have a long time believed to be below the Majesty of the greater Poetry for which I have the Authority of three eminent Poets Mr  Milton  my Lord  Roscommon  and Mr  Dryden  The Reader may see Mr  Milton  's Sentiments in the Preface to his Paradise lost and Mr  Drydens  and my Lord  Roscommon  's before the Beginning and at the End of the Essay on translated Verse  But only the Humble or the Weak will yield to meet Human Authority They who are conceited of their own Understandings will submit to Reason alone And yet methinks the former Authorities carry Reason along with them For they who best understand a Controversy if they have Sincerity are fittest to decide it Now the Sincerity of the three forementioned Writers in relation to Rime ought never to be call'd in question for Mr  Dryden  and my Lord  Roscommon  are known to have exploded it at the very time that they wrote in it and Mr  Milton  was very well known to be one who would not deceive either himself or his Reader It therefore follows that those three Gentlemen had less Understanding of the Efficacy of Poetry and the Power of Numbers than our vulgar Readers who are fond of Rime or that Rime was very justly condemned by them  We shall now with as much Brevity as we can give some Reasons that are independant of Authority why  Rime must of Necessity debase the Majesty and weaken the Spirit of the greater Poetry which bceause the Arguments are entirely new may not perhaps be disagreeable to those who have a tast of Poetry  The Sentiments in Poetry ereate the Spirit or the Passion which are but two Words for the same thing and the Spirit or Passion produces the Expression and begets the Harmony Now 'tis the Expression which shews the Spirit and 'tis the Harmony which causes it to make its utmost Impression And when all these things are adjusted when the Sentiments are adapted to the Subject the Spirit or Passion in a just Degree to the Sentiments and the Harmony and the Expression to the particular Kind and Degree of Spirit or Passion why then the Result of all this is what the Men of Art call Perfection or the Truth of Nature I know indeed very well that Expression and Harmony go together because the Expression includes the Harmony yet for the better clearing of the Matter we shall distinctly treat of them  This then is certain that ev'ry Sentiment or Thought has a Degree of Spirit or Passion or Fire call it what you please which is proper to it and every thing above or below that Degree is utterly wrong Now this is as certain that there is but just one Expression which can convey that Spirit or Passion in its true Proportion And every thing that is not that one Expression is false and weakens the Spirit and obscures the Sentiment Now Nature whose Sagacity is most admirable and her Operations of Celerity almost infinite and who goes the shortest way to her Works very often dictates that Expression at  first especially in the greater Poetry where the Imagination is always warm and the Thoughts are always flowing  But this is plain from common Experience that the Expression which Nature dictates at first and whieh is powerful sounding significant and in short the true one is very often alter'd upon the Account of the Rhime And a Word or two are chang'd which destroys its Beauty and the greater part of its Force makes it less strong less sounding less significant and weakens the Spirit and sets the Sentiment in a false Light From whence it follows that Rime in the greater Poetry running counter to Nature must be against Art  But as every Sentiment has but one particular Expression which of Right belongs to it so that Expression has but one particular Harmony which is adapted to that peculiar Degree of Spirit which naturally attends on the Sentiment Now Nature who as we observed before is wonderful in her Operations very often in the greater Poetry dictates that Harmony together with the Expression Every Poet must know by Experience that the Harmony which we naturally slide into in the greater Poetry is that of Blank Verse which whenever we are oblig'd to alter to introduce the Rime we for the most part impair the Harmony infeeble the Expression debase the Spirit and set the Sentiment in a wrong View  There can be no nearer Relation between any two things in the World than there is in writing between Passion and Harmony Harmony may be said to be both the Father and the Child of Passion 'tis  produced by it and begets it and the more pathetick any Discourse is the more harmonious it must of Necessity be Even of Discourses in Prose those are the most musical which are the most passionate The Orations of  Cicero  have more harmonious Periods than his philosophical Discourses And therefore Poetry is more harmonious than Prose because it is more pathetick And the more pathetick Poetry is the greater must be its Harmony And therefore the Spirit the Passion the Fire or the Flame being very great in the greater Poetry and sometimes very violent have as it were a natural Tendency to the producing perfect Harmony  But Rime being utterly false in Harmony as we shall shew immediately must be contrary to true Passion and to the greater Poetry Rime is the same thing in Relation to Harmony that a Pun is in Relation to Wit as a Pun is false Wit or a foolish Affectation of Wit Rime is false Harmony or an Affectation of Harmony Rime may not so absurdly be said to be the Pun of Harmony  There are in our  English  Poetry four things which have been thought to cndouce to Harmony which are Number Measure Cadence and Rime Of these the three first consist of several different Sounds which are dependant one of another  Rime is wholly independant of the other three and consists in the greater Poetry but of two Sounds which are Unisons Now I appeal to all the Masters of Musick if Unisons can make any Harmony Harmony is the Agreement of different Sounds and the  Perfection of Harmony is the Agreement of discordant Sound by the Mediation of others And there is a great deal of Chromatick Harmony in Poetry as well as in Musick And such particularly is a great deal of  Virgil  's Harmony Well then Rime consisting of Unisons can have no Harmony in it self and being independant of Numbers Cadence and Measure can never promote the Harmony which they produce And a Poet's constant Application to rime diverts his Application in a great Degree from Numbers Measure and Cadence and consequently is a severe Restraint upon the three Producers of Harmony And as it diverts the Application of the Writer so by alluring the Attention of vulgar Readers it diverts them from the other three  But besides that Rime by the Constraint that it puts upon the Writer impairs the Beauty and the natural Force of the Expression and the Power of true Harmony it has something effeminate in its jingling Nature and emasculates our  English  Verse and consequently is utterly unsit for the greater Poetry  English Tragedies  that have been writ in Rime most of them rowl upon Love The Soul of a Tragick Poet who has giv'n himself up to Rime has seldom been capable of Terror or Majesty or the Instruction of the noblest Philosophy or any thing that is truly great  Besides Rime has in its Nature something that is low and comical and the more of Rime there is in a Verse the nearer it comes to the Comick Double Rimes are more comical than the Single and Treble Ones than Either A Rime alone is very often a Jest  as all who are acquainted with  Hudibras  very well know but never any one was extravagant enough to affirm that there was any thing great and noble in Rime alone  But the last Consideration but one  viz  The Effeminacy of Rime and the Influence which it had upon Tragedy brings me to enquire further into the Matter of Fact and to add the Proof of Experience to those which we have drawn from Authority and Reason For Men of Sense are too proud to yield to Authority and Fools are too weak to submit to Reason but Experience which never deceived any one carries Conviction both for the one and the other  The Matter of Fact then is that most of our Plays that have been writ in Rime have been most abominably out of Nature And where in Rime we have one tolerable Tragedy in Blank Verse we have ten So that those very numerical Persons who declare for Rime in other kinds of Poetry are utterly against it in Tragedy But not only the Tragedies in Blank Verse are the best but the very best of our Epick Poems is writ in the same Verse And that is the Paradise lost of  Milton  And though this may in some Measure be attributed to the admirable and extraordinary Choice of the Subject yet I am satisfied that something of its Excellence is owing to the Blank Verse For Mr  Dryden  has handled the very same Subject in Rime but has faln so infinitely short of the Sublimity the Majesty the Vehemence and the other great Qualities of  Milton  that they are never to be nam'd together  Well But since it is manifest from what has been said that Rime is prejudicial both to Poetry and to true Harmony The Reader may very naturally enquire how it came at first to be introduced into our  English  Verse Why  Milton  has given a very good Account of that It was says he the Invention of a barbarous Age to set of wretched Matter and lame Meeter When Rime was first introduced into this Island the Language was without Harmony and the Writers were without Genius And Rime after all that has been said against it must be allowed to be an admirable Invention to conceal the want of Spirit and the want of Harmony Verse with Rime seems to me to be like the Musick of a Bagpipe where the Drone by continually stunning your Ears hinders you from nicely enquiring into the Notes And what a dexterous Expedient Rime is to conceal the want of Genius may appear abundantly from most of the Riming Plays that were writ and acted in King  Charles  the Second's Time In most of which it is very plain that Rime made extravagant Simile pass for Nature abominable Fustan for fine Language ridiculous Rant for great Spirit and senseless Whining for true Passion Well But is our Language now without Harmony So far from that that it is the most musical perhaps of the  Western  Are now our Writers without Genius No certainly not all of them But why does Rime continue then Why is it writ Why does it please Why in the first place there are Thousands who read Rime who never so much as heard of Blank Verse and when we consider those who have heard of it we have little Reason  to wonder that a great many of them can by no means tast it if we reflect upon the Prevalence of Prejudice and the Force of Custom They who read Poetry have been us'd to Rime from their Infancy and what cannot long Habititude render agreeable Let us instance particularly in Sounds Enquire of the Inhabitants of  London  Bridge if the Fall of the Water there is not grown as it were natural to them by long use Ask them if it be not necessary either to compose their Spirits or to keep them up If they do not sleep with the more Soundness for it and wake with the more Chearfulness Examine a Fellow who has liv'd all his Life in a Papermill and he shall assure you that not only the Running round of the Wheels and the hurrying Noise of the Mill but even the insupportable Jangling of the Cogs is a thing that sooths him is a thing that pleases him that he is melancholly when he is long out of the Hearing of it and even weary and sick of less tumultuons Sounds Nay ask even a Fellow that has been bred to sawing of Marble and he shall tell you that the Sound which it makes is Musick to him And sawing of Marble is next to Riming the most impertinent Noise in Nature  After what has been said no Man will wonder if Readers who have all their Life Time been used to Rime soon grow weary and sick of true Harmony unless in Case of a delicate Ear which is so rare a Gift of Nature that it has been observed in every Nation that Harmony has been the very last thing that has been improved in Poetry and as soon as in any Nation the Poetical Harmony has grown perfect there the whole Art of Poetry has been accomplish'd  But to come from the Readers of Poetry to the Writers These last are of two Sorts the good and the bad The bad will certainly endeavour to maintain Rime because Rime does in some measure conceal their want of Ear and their want of Genius and is perhaps as necessary to the giving them a sort of a dull Mettle and to the keeping them jogging on with their Burden of Dulness as Bells are requisite to a Carthorse or to a Packhorse which very Bells upon the Course at  NewMarket  would but render the Racer ridiculous and would but stop his Speed Rime has the last of these Effects upon a good Writer and would have the first if it were not for the Force of Custom And 'tis the Prevalence of Custom alone that keeps good Writers fast to it Some great Men who have writ well in spight of it serve to keep them in Countenance for they little consider that those great Men would have writ much better if they had writ without it Besides the Business of most even good Writers is to make themselves popular there are but few very few of them who are capable of sacrificing their Interest ro their Reputations and to the Service which they do to the Publick by improving a noble Art and they are rather vain than ambitious and had rather have a present general Applause than a Reputation in time to come lasting and universal  The universal use of Blank Verse in Tragedy and be spreading Fame of  Milton  is a sure Prognostick of he decaying Reputation of Rime A Man may venure to foretell without incurring the Censure of being  or visionary that before this Century is half expir'd  Rime will be wholly banished from our greater Poetry A Custom that has been a long time generally received cannot be broke at once but nothing that is false can remain always 'Tis true indeed Prejudice and Opinion and Interest and Vanity are frequent Friends to Falshood but Time the most sagacious of all Criticks will surely be a Friend to Truth  I desire that the Reader would take notice that it is only in the greater Poetry that I have been condemning Rime It may do well enough in Amorous Verses and it may be necessary in some sorts of Satyr For the following Verses I do not pretend that because they are without Rime they are without all Defects If I had had more time they should have been less numerous and some Expressions should not have been repeated Not but that there are several Repetitions in the following Poem which were studied and sought for upon the acc ount ofGrace and Ornament but there is here and there one which should have been omitted  THE EMPIRE Sav`d AND  EUROPE  Deliver`d  UP Rouze your selves ye Nations praise the Lord  Sing ye deliver'd Nations to your God  A lofty Song of Thankfulness and Praise  For his Almighty Arm o'erthrew the Proud  His be the Triumph as the Conquest his  And thou O God rais'd High above all Gods  Thou God of great Revenge true God of War  Who

Liberty and Faith  Great Patroness of all the Christian World  Lo first for thee and thy auspicious Reign  Th' exulting Nation's Praise to Heav'n return  Is there a Climate so remote on Earth  Where distress'd Virtue is beyond the Reach  Of thy extensive Charity Thy Aid  Thro' all his rapid Course old  Danube  owns  And proudly curling his Imperial Waves  To distant barbarous Armies transports thy Fame  Thy wond'rous Virtue to his gladsome Shores  Transported  Tagus  wafts o'er Golden Sand  A Thousand Ecchoes from his Shores reply  Thy Praise his Nymphs in tuneful Notes rehearse  The Darling Theme of  Lusitanian  Song  Thy Fame Great Queen the horrid Alps ascends  And warms them cover'd with eternal Snow  Their Natives amidst wintry Horrors plac'd  Warmly thy Goodness and thy

 And let th' attending Universe reply  Let Earth and Heav'n rehearse the lofty Song  While the bright Church Triumphant in the Sky  And the blest Church Triumphing here below  Joyn in one Chorus of Immortal Praise  Ye Nations raise your Tuneful Notes on High  And raising to the Stars your mighty Arms  Your Arms now mighty now secur'd from Bonds  O lift above the Stars your joyful Praise  To him from whom alone Deliverance flows  But be thy Voice distinguish'd from the rest  Thou stately Daughter of Imperial  Rome  Germania  Thou Canst thou confine thy Joy  Canst thou the Transports of thy Praise restrain  O no Thou surely wilt grow wild with Joy  For thou hast past at once beyond all Hope  To blissful Rapture from extream Despair  Thou art deliver'd from a World of Woe  Now nought but stormy Shouts of Joy are heard  From  Rhaetian  Mountains to the Northern Main  Where lately nought but doleful Sighs were heard  And piercing Groans and Shrieks and rueful Wails  Thou stately Daughter of Imperial  Rome  Wert bound alas with most opprobrious Bonds  And basely threaten'd with impending Rape  Thy trembling Offspring helpless round thee ran  And some shriek'd piously aloud for Aid  While others wrung their wretched Arms in vain  Some frighted into Madness wildly star'd  And some look'd on with stupid Eyes aghast  Some swooning dying with their Grief exprest  By their last Groans their vast Excess of Woe  One desperate Villain help'd thy raging Foes  With execrable Hands his Mother bound  And for her impious Ravishers prepar'd  Thou  Danube  wert confounded at the Sight  And troubled backward to thy Fountain turn'dst  Then lifting thy sonorous Voice on High  Call'dst to thy Brother  Rhine  aloud for Aid  Thy Brother  Rhine  soon heard thy sounding Voice  But sadly shaking his Majestick Head  And casting a compassionating Look  Strait hid himself within his thickest Ooze  What couldst thou do But shrink thy inglorious Head  Within thy Reeds and breath forth empty Threats  The windy Births of melancholy Rage  When in the dreary Horrors of the Dark  As oft as Night return'd t' imbrown thy Waves  Thou like a  Bittern  through thy doleful Reeds  Complaind'st in sullen and in moody Groans  Expressing Manly Sorrow mixt with Rage  While thy brown Billows sounding on thy Shore  And swinging slow with hoarse and sullen Roar  Kept murmuring Consort to thy threatning Moan  Thou  Danube  to the  Euxin  durst not run  To which insulting thou wert wont to fly  Not to discharge the Tribute of thy Waves  But carry Terrors to th' astonish'd Main  And make the Crescent wear a deadlier Pale  Now swiftly  Danube  to the  Euxin  fly  And in thy rapid Flight thy Maker praise  Sound sound his Praise at all thy extended Mouths  And let th' attending  Euxin  with a Groan  That may to  Constantine  's proud Tow'rs resound  Reflect how Heav'n confounds persidious Men  Then turning to the distant  Rhine  thy Voice  Raise it that all th' astonish'd  Rhine  may hear  And lifting up thy Arms now free from Bonds  Lifting aloft thy now Victorious Arms  Let him with Rapture see with Rapture hear  The Effects of  Bleinheim  's Field He hears he hears  And rouzing up himself with generous Rage  Prepares to shake off his ignoble Bonds  And reap the Fruit of  Bleinheim  's glorious Day  Germania  Raise thy tuneful Voice to Heaven  Let thy fierce Eagle towring to the Skies  In Thunder bear thy Maker's Praise to Heav'n  Who has for thee perform'd amazing things  Which but to hope had been Presumption thought  And what had look'd like Wildness ev'n to wish  Th' unconquer'd  English  from the  Northern  Main  March to thy Aid O vast Surprize of Joy  Heark How thy ravish'd Offspring shout for Joy  Heark How they fiercely cry Revenge Revenge  O welcome welcome to our longing Souls  For whose dear Sake a thousand times we'll die  See see thy Sons in firm Battalions stand  Dejected now desponding now no more  See great Revenge inflame their Martial Eyes  And round their Temples spread its warlike Die  But whence this Spirit Whence this wond'rous Change  The unconquer'd  English  from the Northern Main  March to thy Aid O vast Surprise of Joy  They whom thy wond'ring Eyes ne'er saw before  Nor them nor their Forefathers since the Time  Thy rugged  Saxons  left their horrid Clime  For  Britain  's gentle Shore at last are come  Are unexpected and unhop'd for come  See to their ancient wretched Mother's Aid  The Pious Nation march impetuous on  Germania  raise thy tuneful Voice to Heav'n  And praise return to Heav'n and gracious  Ann  Who sends them to thy Aid she Day and Night  Breaks her own Rest to give the World Repose  To give it Liberty and lasting Peace  For only Gracious  Ann  can under Heav'n  Give Freedom to the World and lasting Peace  For only she o'er willing Nations reigns  O'er freeborn Souls whose Glory and whose Pride  Is to infranchize all the Christian World  And she can give the lab'ring Nations Peace  For as the Dove that from the Deluge fled  Brought her mild Olive to the shelt'ring Ark  Fram'd by great Heav'ns Command to save Mankind  And found Protection there so gentle Peace  Now Slaughter deluges the Nations round  To  Anna  's sacred Breast for Shelter flies  And finds sure Refuge there and will from thence  Send its blest Influence out to glad the World  But the  French  Tyrant's Breast had never Peace  There endless Strife there dire Ambition reigns  He what he never had can ne'er bestow  Peace without Freedom is an empty Name  But he calls miserable Bondage Peace  As Plunder Murder Rape he Empire calls  Germania  Praise return to Heav'n and  Ann  'Tis Heav'n and she that from the Northern Main  Have sent the noblest Nation to thy Aid  Which the wide Ocean from the World divides  A Nation round the which wise Nature casts  The stormy Main subjected to her Sway  That no usurping Tyrant might invade  The sacred Refuge of fair Liberty  And the World's Champion People might annoy  For wheresoever faithless  Gallia  sends  Her Grim Destroyers there  Britannia  sends  Her glad Deliverers to preserve Mankind  A Nation which the lovely Fame enjoys  Still to have fought for Liberty for Truth  For all the injur'd Nations common Rights  Which speaks to dire Ambition in the Tone  The thund'ring Tone that Heav'n reproves the Main  Here know thy Bounds here stop thy aspiring Waves  Her's are the shining Squadrons that descend  Aiong thy Shore in terrible Array  Their Forms not wholly like nor yet unlike thy Sons  Resembling just as far as Brethren should  As they who from the same brave Sires descend▪  How thou art ravish'd with their lofty Meens  The Joy that in their Looks severely shines  And all the dreadful Spirit in their Eyes  Dauntless unparalell'd invincible  Secure of Victory secure of Fame  Such Spirit never did thy Eyes behold  No never thy Heroick  Eugene  cries  Such mighty  Eugene  never saw before  No wond'rous Prince thou such couldst never see  Tho' thou hast long Triumphant Armies led  Tho' thou hast conquer'd Foes of every kind  Humbling the Pride of the perfidious East  And the more faithless Tyrant of the West  Tho' thou hast been victorious in more Lands  Than wand'ring Travellers have seen yet thou  Couldst ne'er before this Hour such Spirit see  Because thou ne'er before this Hour beheldst  An Army from a freeborn People chose  For only  Briton  's of the Race of Men  Their Liberties entirely have maintain'd  Nobly maintain'd against the joint Assaults  Of Homebred Treason and external Rage  The Pride of Foreign Tyrants and their own  Know 'tis from Liberty thou wond'rous Man  Master of daring Councils yet of wise  From Godlike Liberty this noble Fire  This dauntless this immortal Spirit flows  Germania  raise thy tuneful Voice on high  This is the Nation preordain'd by Fate  To save thee Daughter of Imperial  Rome  Just sinking in the vast Abyss of Time  Like thy great Mother under barb'rous Rage  Hear this y' aspiring Rulers of the Earth  Ye who for empty Noise or transient Pow'r  Oppress the weak and undermine the strong  Ye Plagues of God to scourge a guilty World  By vain Pursuits of Arbitrary Sway  Who this magnanimous People would destroy  That stands between your proud Designs and you  Hear this and think that nothing's lasting here  Empires like Men insensibly decay  Think that the time must come when you or yours  Must tast the sad Vicissitudes of Fate  And in your Turns by proud Oppression groan  Then hate so brave a People if you can  A People the sure Hope of the distress'd  The brave Defenders of the Rights of Kings  And the just Guardians of fair Liberty  Europe  's immortal Body of Reserve  Against the Squadrons of Tyrannick Pow'r  Oh  Austria Austria  had thy  Philip  known  That time e'en then was harnessing the Years  When this brave People Object of his Rage  And of his Hate should prove thy noblest Friends'  Should rescue both thy bright Imperial Crowns  Deliver  Germany  recover  Spain  Raise up thy drooping Eagle from the Dust  And fix new Thunder on his soaring Wings  Then deep Reflection on the just Returns  Of Fate had dash'd his proud aspiring Thoughts  The chief Ambition of his Soul had been  To be allied to such a generous Race  He great  Eliza  would have courted then  For Friendship as  Maria  for Desire  That strict inviolable League which joins  Our Int'rests now e'en then had been begun  And  Philip  then like  Leopold  or  Charles  With great  Britannia  's awful Queen had joyn'd  To establish Right and Peace and from the Proud  And strong Oppressor vindicate Mankind  Ye Nations who profess the Christian Faith  Together raise your tuneful Notes on High  So High that all the list'ning World may hear  And let th' attending Universe reply  Let Earth and Heav'n repeat the lofty Song  While the bright Church Triumphant in the Sky  And the blest Church Triumphing here below  Joyn in one Chorus of Immortal Praise  But let the Sound of thy aspiring Song  Britannia  be distinguish'd from them all  As among all thy Offspring  Anna  's fam'd  For pious Praise and Gratitude to Heav'n  So o'er thy Sister Nations be thy Song  Renown'd for Heaven and Nature have bestow'd  On thee the Talent of exalted Song  Britannia  Thou canst sing such lofty Strains  As Heav'n and Nature may rejoice to hear  And Heav'n superlatively honours thee  And o'er thy Sister Nations lifts thy Name  Thee they all bless and thee they all admire  Among them like the Morning Star thou shin'st  But to Oppressors like the Fiery  Mars  Star  Or like a Comet that with sanguine Blaze  Denounces War and Revolutions dire  To purple Tyrants a portentous Light  Such new unheard of Fame thou hast acquir'd  As never old nor modern Nations knew  Grecians  indeed and  Romans Persians Medes  And modern  Spaniards  too and modern  Gauls  Have conquering fought for universal Sway  For universal Freedom only thou  By so much more illustrious than them all  As 'tis more truly glorious to redeem  Than 'tis to damn the wretched Race of Men  Then stretch thy lofty Voice to Heav'n and sing  Thy Maker's Praise that Earth and Heav'n may hear  By him thou freed'st the World at  Bleinheim  's Field  'Twas he supplied thee with the Godlike Will  His Terrors and his Thunders arm'd thy Pow'rs  He thy Great Queen with sovereign Wisdom blest  Instructing her to choose the glorious Chief  Deserving to command her daring Troops  Embattel'd for the Freedom of the World  A general Worthy of Heroick Times  For  Marlborough  now fills the Breath of Fame  Like  Grecian  or the Godlike  Roman  Names  But who shall paint thee wond'rous Chief in whom  Repugnant Qualities are reconciled  Secret thy Soul as is the dead of Night  Yet chearful as the Smile of opening Day  That lofty awful and commanding Brow  With sweet atractive Majesty invites  Calm are his Thoughts in his profound Designs  Yet swift tho' sure his executing Might  His Breast supply'd with all the glorious Fire  That burns with inextinguishable Flame  In the aspiring Minds of those brave Men  Who by great Actions court eternal Fame  Yet he by a transcendent Force of Mind  Entirely Master of that tow'ring Fire  Which like his Slave he absolutely sways  With a Controuling and a Lordly Pow'r  Calm are his Gestures his Majestick Brow  Compos'd ne'er dark with Grief nor rough with Rage  But always mild attractive bright serene  In whom deep Foresight dwells unknown to fear  And Intrepidity unknown to Rage  The Love of Fame that urges him away  T' immortal Actions still severely curb'd  Always obedient to cool Wisdom's Voice  And guided like the Chariot of the Sun  Whose animating Fires preserve the World  Far far above the Tempests stormy Rage  Wisely he manages the Nerves of War  Yet a Contemner of the vastest Sums  When Glory and the general Cause require  Tho new to the Command on  Danube  's Shore  His Essay an Heroick Masterpiece  Whose Brightness dazles all Spectators Eyes  Astonishes our Friends confounds our Foes  Stupendous the Design in ev'ry Part  Whether the vast Conception we regard  Or the surprizing Secresy with which  'Twas long conceal'd from penetrating Eyes  Or the amazing Swiftness of his March  When from the  Maese  his wond'ring Troops he led▪  Or the judicious Boldness of his Choice  When he began with dreadful  Schellenbourgh  Which Conquest open'd the  Bavarian  Plains  And made them to victorious Flames a Prey  That their perfidious Chief impatient grown  Under his Country's irritating Spoil  Might force the backward  French  t'engage as soon  As  Marlborough  the bright Occasion found  How great is he who in his ample Thought  Could comprehend and afterwards prepare  By the illustrious Toils of two Campagns  In which a large Extent of Ground he gain'd  A strengthning Barrier for the cautious  Dutch  Th' astonishing Design which all at once  Like Magick changes all the Face of War  Confounds the  Gallick  Tyrants proud Designs  Dashes him headlong from his tow'ring Thoughts  The Mountains heap'd on Mountains in his Head  From which his proud Imagination thought  To drive our Reason God's Vicegerent here  And rule the Earth with Hells dispotick Sway  He like a hoary Wizard close immur'd  In his enchanted Castle sat retir'd  And there unseen he mutter'd secret Sounds  And there Infernal Characters he drew  That muster'd up black Clouds t'obscure the Day  And scare the Nations with their dreadful Gloom  And then the Tempest rag'd the Thunder roar'd  Threatning the World with universal Wreck  At length the time ordain'd by Fate is come  The Conq'ring Hero's come who breaks the Charm  And now the old Enchanter looks aghast  Forlorn forsaken by th' Infernal Pow'rs  And trembling at th' impending Wrath of Heav'n  But of the Talents of thy mighty Mind  Immortal  Marlbro'  what we most admire  Is that Rapidity by which to Fame  Thro' all the Bars that Art or Nature cast  Thro' hardest Rocks thou hew'st thy wond'rous Way  Daring yet wise thy Conduct and resolv'd  With all the Judgment of discerning Thought  For the great Juncture call'd for all thy Speed  Th' insulting  French  were overturning all  And Liberty in dire Convulsions lay  The Empire foundring like a vast Galloon  That's by the Tempest beat on ev'ry side  When raging Ocean in a general Storm  Sends his sonorous Billows to th' Assault  Savoy  was sinking and the cruel  French  Climbing the Summits of the horrid  Alps  Embrue'd their murd'ring Hands in guiltless Blood  Ev'n in the dreadful Region of the Thunder  The  Lusitanian  grumbled at the Chance  Of adverse War and unexpected Rout  And fondly sighed for ancient Leagues again  With Terror more then cold  Helvetia  shook  Whiter than Ambient Snow her deadly Hue  And howling o'er her  Alpine  Rocks she ran  Tho' fenc'd with  Alpine  Rocks yet unsecure  And trembling with pale Fear her hoary Hair  That hung dishevel'd and the Sport of Winds  She tore and would have wrung her wretched Arms  But her own Sons for mercenary Sums  Had bound her wretched Arms with Chains of Gold  And her Majestick Robe had rudely torn  And naked left her to the killing Cold  A Gyant o'er the Neighbouring Mountains stalk'd  With mad Deportment and with savage Mein  And cruel Eyes that threaten'd instant Fate  Italia  Ah how faln how chang'd from her  Who won the World with her victorious Arms  With the wide Ocean circumscrib'd her Sway  And with the Stars her never dying Fame  Was basely into vile Submission brav'd  Brittain  in dreadful Expectation lay  By two contending Daughters to be torn  Both stubborn Foes to Union and yet both  Unless united hopelesly undone  England  was plagu'd with an unnatural Race  A Race expecting but the Blow of Fate  The cutting off one slender royal Thread  That Thread on which the Christian World depends  And then but long avert that Hour ye Heavens  Resolving infamously to betray  Their Country to a Foreign Tyrants Pow'r  These were the potent Reasons for Dispatch  Beside th' undaunted Spirit that appear'd  In the brave Squadrons and Batallions joyn'd  That flash'd victorious Lightning from their Eyes  Which their great Leader soon perceiv'd with Joy  Too wise their boyling Ardor to restrain  And check their Fire impatient to be freed  Rais'd and inflam'd by that stupendious March  Such as their fam'd Forefathers never knew  And which attracted the admiring Eyes  Of all the gazing World and seem'd to cry  They had not time to cool but must do things  To satisfy th' expecting World so great  As scarce their great Forefathers e'er perform'd  Besides 'tis not the Valour of their Troops  To which the  French  their boasted Conquests owe  'Tis not their Discipline which makes them dreadful  'Tis Treason Subornation Daggers Poison  Besides a thousand other Arts obscene  Could they by Discipline or Force prevail  'Tis manifest they bravely would disdain  To have Recourse to such inglorious ways  And wisely the sagacious General thought  The sooner he compell'd them to decide  The Contest by the last Event of War  The less Occasion would the Traytors find  To try detestable infernal Arts  Add that th' exhausted Empire could afford  No long Supply to such a numerous Host  Lastly this War was an Appeal to Heav'n  And this great Cause the darling Cause of Heav'n  For 'twas for Truth they appear'd in glorious Arms  For Justice Liberty Religion God  And shewing his brave Troops that he repos'd  His Confidence in Heav'n would fire their Souls  And would sustain them in the dreadful Field  More than a thousand Bodies of Reserve  And what could more convince th' impatient Troops  That he repos'd his Confidence in Heav'n  Than sudden and determinate Recourse  To the decisive Vengeance of the Field  Urg'd by these pow'rful Motives to Dispatch  He his bold  English  leads to  Schellenbourgh  Where the  Bavarian  and the  Gallick  Troops  Lie with the utmost Skill of Art intrench'd  To guard th' important Pass of  Donawert  Of  Donawert Bavaria  's fatal Key  Upon possessing which the great Success  Of this illustrious Enterprize depends  There he the Orders for the fierce Assault  Issues with chearful Majesty serene  Valour in human Hearts too oft proceeds  From ardent Temper or from glowing Rage  Provok'd by mortal Wrongs or Fear of Shame  But here remote from Fear or Rage behold  A Valour worthy of the Heroick Chief  Who leads the Squadrons that appear in Arms  For Liberty at once and spotless Faith  The two great Causes of the Earth and Sky  And here the  French  their Maxim may recant  Le Soleil ny la mortne se peuvent Regarder Fixement  Roche Refl    That no Man can with fix'd Regards survey  The dazling Front of Death or of the Sun  For as an Eagle with a stedfast Eye  Stares on th' effulgent Fountain of the Day  Which streaming with impetuous Floud of Light  Blinds other Gazers with its torrent Fire  So  Marlbro'  with a calm considerate Soul  Undazle'd view'd the King of Terrors Front  That cruel Front that with its ghastful Glare  Without his  Adamantine  Mace can bill  Expos'd to  Gallick  and  Bavarian  Fire  He all his chearful Majesty maintains  His Orders to exact Advantage gives  Commanding all the Movements of his Soul  With independant and with Lordly Pow'r  He who himself thus absolutely rules  Seems by wise Nature fram'd for martial Sway  His shouting Troops exalt him to the Sky  Him they all imitate him all admire  On pointed Cannon they have run before  Here they do more and hush'd and passive stand  While their invincible Brigades are form'd  Awaiting what Commands their wond'rous Chief  Has to impose while all the murd'ing Fire  Of the  Bavarian  Cannon tears their Ranks  Troubling whole Squadrons with the Tyrant Rage  Of missionary Thunder they mean while  Who by no Rage no Fury are sustain'd  The Frenzy that on Brutal Courage waits  But by true Valour by Heroick Minds  Unmov'd unshaken keep the dangerous Posts  Which were assign'd them by their dread Commander  The Friends and dear Companions of their Toyls  Those whom they cherish equal to themselves  Torn from their Sides without Concern they see  A nobler Care possesses all their Souls  Themselves too torn they from themselves behold  Their mangled Trunks divided from their Limbs  Yet all their dauntless Spirit they retain  E'en for themselves no Grief no Pity shew  They see the King of Terrors in their View  They see him stalking near with hideous Stride  They see him frowning with a ghastful Scowl  Threatning to grasp their Hearts with Iron Gripe  Yet see it all untroubled undismay'd  O Greatness worthy  Greece  or Ancient  Rome  O Valour worthy of eternal Fame  The great  Epaminondas  thus expir'd  For his dear  Thebes  for his great Cause concern'd  Regardless of his Blood regardless of his Life  And they like him would think themselves too blest  To see their Party Victors e'er they expire  If any shew Concern 'tis only Fear  Least they should fall before their General's Voice  Allows them to discharge th' impetuous Fire  That now pent inward choaks their generous Hearts  Thrice happy if permitted e'en in Death  To be the Instruments imploy'd by Fate  To bestow Freedom on the Christian World  And on their Country never dying Fame  But what are they unable to perform  Who such Extreams with Godlike Patience bear  They who appear'd so calm so meek before  Are now all Rage all storming Fury grown  Now Fate looks frowning from their wrathful Brows  Now from their flaming Eyes red Lightning flies  While in their Arms th' avenging Thunder roars  And now of dying they can think no more  Their General's fatal Order is to kill  His Voice they as the Voice of Fate regard  And as the Ministers of Fate themselves  Rushing like sounding Waters they assault  The strong Retrenchments so with bellowing Sound  Old Oceans Rage attacks some lofty Digue  Which sturdy Swains have rais'd t' oppose his Pow'r  He Billows upon Billows storming pours  Which rise and swell and rage and foam and roar  Till the victorious Tenth at last comes on  O'erwhelming all with dismal Inundation  In vain the Foe outragiously resists  The Trumpet kindles  Mars  with fiercer Sounds  And in their Ears it clangs its martial Roar  Which to the  English  sounds the Voice of Fame  That to immortal Glory calls them on  Now all War's Godhead rages in their Breasts  And to themselves they Demy Gods appear  Oh the transporting Fury Has the World  An Enemy that can resist them now  In vain grim Death in his most hideous Shape  With haughty Strides along th' Intrenchments stalts  Whom all his Terrors all his Plagues sustain  Th' undaunted  English  turn him on the Foe  He sees  Britannia  's Genius in their Eyes  And in a dreadful Tone cries out my Friends  These are my Friends my Benefactors these  Lead on ye Race of Demy Gods lead on  I follow you and all your Steps attend  Fortune and Fate are on the Conqueror's Side  Impetuous now they rush conducting Fate  To their resistless Fury all things bow  For what must not submit to Fate or them  Now ev'ry thing against the Foe conspires  And Fire and Water to confound them League  Behind them conqu'ring Death in fiery Cart  Drives on and urges furiously the Chase  Discharging Lightnings and the vollied Thunder  Before them the revenging  Danube  swells  And then he gaping with a hideous Yawn  And roaring swallows down his impious Prey  Britannia  Let thy Joy salute the Skies  And to thy Maker tuneful Praise return  For he the Valour of thy matchless Sons  And thy great General's Conduct he inspir'd  Let the whole Earth enquire of  Bleinheim  's Field  And that immortal Field will cry aloud  To all enquiring Nations all enquiring times  Thy matchless Sons no mortal Valour shew'd  And thy great General's Conduct was Divine  And thou too with thy Maker's Praise resound  Thou Field of  Bleinheim  once obscure accurst  But now great  Bleinheim  's happy glorious Field  Thou who wert charm'd with the Transporting Sight  Who sawst the Godlike Men the Godlike Deed  Who sawst them thund'ring in the fierce Pursuit  While  Danube  rising with revenging Floud  Swallow'd whole Legions with a hideous Roar  Immortal  Bleinheim  preordain'd by Fate  To be the blissful Spot that frees the World  Raise to the ravish'd Skies thy Thund'ring Voice  And for thy mighty Bliss thy Maker praise  For thou to all Posterity art blest  Blest above all the beauteous Fields o'er which  The winding  Danube  curls his amorous Arms  No Length of Days thy Glory shall deface  Nor ever Darkness of the Night obscure  All times all Nations thee shall happy call  By whom all times all Nations shall be blest  Thou lovely Field of happy  Bleinheim  Hail  Mayst thou be ever fortunate as fam'd  Thy Sons above the Race of Men be blest  May proud Oppression and revenging Care  As they their executing Circuit go  Fly from thy blissful Borders far away  O mayst thou still be happy still be free  Thou who hast made the happy Nations free  And pour ye Heav'ns into her lovely Lap  Your sweetest and your most refreshing Dews  That flowing Plenty all her Days may crown  And golden Slumbers all her blissful Nights  And when from Heav'n the murd'ring Angel comes  To visit with consuming Plagues the Earth  May he behold upon thy blissful Soil  The Stains of  Gallick  and  Bavarian  Blood  And passing by revere the sacred Ground  And thou O sacred O Majestick Day  Who gav'st to the great Deed auspicious Light  O thou who broughtst to Light the noblest Birth  That ever Fate begat on fertile time  Still as thy Light revolves O sacred Day  Resounding with thy Maker's Praise return  For highly has thy Maker honoured thee  Above all Days of the revolving Year  His Praise then in a thousand Tongues resound  Let Millions of glad Voices raise it high  So mayst thou still be charmingly serene  So may thy Halcyon Hours drive smoothly on  Illustrious far above the rest of Days  On thee may thy bright Sire profusely pour  A double Portion of his flowing Gold  O mayst thou still with sacred Joy return  With all the Rapture of transporting Song  And let the World forget the sprightly  May  The Day accomplishing the Joyful Spring  To celebrate thy lovelier Festival  For Freedom is more joyful than the Spring  Fairer than Light and lovelier than the Morn  Let never any Cloud thy Lustre stain  And never any Grief pollute thy Joy  May Grief and Care and Pain at thy Approach  As from descending Angels disappear  Mayst thou auspicious prove to ev'ry Deed  Accomplish ev'ry Act begun on thee  Thee may great Minds for mighty Actions choose  By high Foreknowledge sure O sacred Day  Thou wert ordain'd t' accomplish wond'rous things  Thy happy Influence once before preserv'd  The lab'ring World from universal Sway  At least a while delay'd its dismal Fate  'Twas upon thee the  Carthaginian  Chief  Making the World's aspiring Tyrants yield  Vanquish'd proud  Rome  at  Canne  's fatal Field  But time was teeming with a nobler Birth  And  Bleinheim  's Day surpasses  Canne  's Field  At  Cannae  the contending Rivals strove  Which of them should enslave the vanquish'd World  The great Contention was at  Bleinheim  's Field  On one side to oppress immortal Liberty  To make her wing her Flight from Earth to Heav'n  And there for ever with  Astrea  dwell  Her divine Sister on the other side  Th' Intent was solidly to fix her here  In lasting Peace and make of Earth a Heav'n  And never two more powerful Armies met  Than that which strove to drive thee from below  And that O Goddess which maintain'd thy Pow'r  On the Oppressors side the Hostile  French  With the  Bavarian  Squadrons now were joyn'd  The fierce  Bavarians  were by Nature fram'd  Hardy and rough and fit for Bloody Fields  And Victory had rais'd their Spirits high  Expert was their perfidious Chief and brave  And now the Memory of past Success  And Hope of future Empire fir'd his Soul  And the wild Prospect of his flaming Tow'rs  Stung him till frantick with his Rage he roar'd'  And call'd on Heav'n and Hell for dire Revenge  The  French  were all of  Gallick  Troops the Flow'r  Experienc'd and Victorious were their Chiefs  Soldiers and Chiefs inur'd to vast Success  And claiming Right to Conquest and Renown  From long Possession with their dearest Blood  Resolv'd their lofty Title to defend  By long Success presumptious grown and vain  Aspiring to the Conquest of the World  Believed by all the Nations and themselves  To be unequall'd and invincible  Proud of their Junction with  Bavarian  Pow'rs  Which they with so much Hazard so much Toil  Inspight of all great  Eugene  's Force atchiev'd  From which the Empire sure Destruction waits  And all the Christian World perpetual Bonds  But O how vain are human Hopes and Fears  How blind is the poor Providence of Man  And what a Fool to the Designs of Fate  The dreadful Moment comes upon the Wing  When they who make this Junction now their Boast  Their Pride their Hope their Joy their Extasy  When they whole conquer'd Provinces would give  That this accursed Junction ne'er had been  When that which now deludes their glorious Minds  With the vain Hope of Empire and of Fame  Will prove the gawdy Lure thrown out by Fate  To bring them down from their aspiring Flight  And leave them in the Dust  For now the conqu'ring  English  are in view  Inspiriting the whole Confederate Pow'r  For what to them can be impossible  After the glorious Rout at  Schellenbourgh  A Conquest gain'd when scarce their March was o'er  A March like what great  Philip  's greater Son  Or the first  Caesar  took to win the World  A March almost incredible to those  Who saw at  Schellenbourgh  its great Effect  A March so swift that it prevented Fame  For such Dispatch transcends the  Germans  Thought  At which their listless Nations look amaz'd  They gazing seem the  English  to regard  As if descended to their Aid from Heav'n  And their illustrious Chief on  Danube  's Shore  No less astonishes the various Powers  Whose Squadrons the Confederate force compose  Than a Bright Star that all at once appears  With new Effulge in the Hemisphere  Amazes all the planatary Worlds  Who gazing cry 'tis sent express from Heav'n  To change the Fortune of the Universe  The Nations in the  British  Squadrons Eyes  Divine Presage of Victory behold  Full of their Islands noble Pride they march  Full of their fierce Forefathers conqu'ring Fire  And while they deathless Vigour in them feel  Esteem themselves invincible alone  Believing firmly that to conquer  France  Is but their old Hereditary Right  Which from remote Progenitors descends  Who then were wont to triumph over  France  Ev'n when they were a People fierce and free  When for their Country and their Friends they fought  Fought for their dear Relations and themselves  How must they then disdain to yield to those  Who to support a Griezly Tyrants Pride  Against their Country and their Friends contend  Against their dear Relations and themselves  That for their Parts they fight for Justice Truth  For God and for Celestial Liberty  That Fate the first Occasion now presents  When they the Foe may in the Field surprize  Without oppressing Numbers on their Side  Whom they resolve like  Englishmen  t' attack  That is like Men resolv'd to o'ercome or die  That now the Eyes of all the Christian World  Are on this great decisive Action bent  That all the Christian World expects from them  Deeds worthy of the Champions of Mankind  Against oppressing Tyrants Beasts more wild  Than  Africk  e're produc'd and which proceed  To render  Europe  yet more waste than her  That they must fight like Heroes who support  The Glory of their conqu'ring Ancestors  Who great  Britannia  's Liberties assert  And those of other sinking Realms restore  Who vindicate their own undoubted Rights  And those of all Posterity defend  With Godlike Sentiments like these inflam'd  They under their heroick Leader march  T' attack the Foe encamp'd on  Bleinheim  's Field  The rest to deathless Lyres ye Angels sing  To such a Height no mortal Force can soar  And now the Inspiration leaves my Soul▪  Or if I must with feeble Wings essay  Th' Aetherial Flight assist y' Aetherial Pow'rs  And thou the brightest Angel of the Sky  With whose enchanting Beauties all the Host  Of Heav'n above all Heav'nly Minds below  Are charm'd with whom the great Creator's charm'd  Eternal Fame Thee Goddess I invoke  For nothing without thy Aid was e'er produc'd  Or great or fair in Earth or Heav'n above  So the great Maker will'd and made it Fate  Descend bright Goddess to my Aid descend  T' infuse a Beam of thy Celestial Fire  Into my Soul and raise my adventurous Song  If with thy Beauties all my Soul is fir'd  If all that wretched Mortals here call great  I sacrifice to Liberty and thee  Instruct me Goddess for thou only knowst  For thou with all thy Hundred Eyes wert by  When stooping on thy azure Wings thou leftst  The Fields of Light for  Bleinheim  's glorious Field  Thou Goddess with thy own Celestial Trump  Didst sound the Charge through all th' Aetherial Vault  When at th' Immortal Blast the Pow'rs above  Look'd wond'ring from the Battlements of Heav'n  Thou saw'st how all the Host of Heav'n look'd down  And shouting fill'd the eternal Realms with Joy  To see bold Man the Cause of Heav'n maintain  The Souls of  British  Heroes from the Sky  Upon the Glories of that Field look'd down  Thither their Eyes the Conq'ring  Edwards  bent  On that magnanimous  Henry  wond'ring gaz'd  All charm'd to see their times of Gold return  All charm'd to see bright Victory descend  And perch upon an  English  General's Plume  There the blest Patron of  Britannick  Knights  The Red Cross Champion look'd transported down  To see the Honour of his Order rais'd▪  And there look'd down the blissful Souls of those  Who in the same immortal Cause expir'd  At  Fleury  and at  Landen  's fatal Plain  And Godlike  William  look'd with Rapture down  To see great  Marlborough  do what he had done  Had but the false  Bavarian  been his Foe  The preexisting Souls of future Kings  On that important Field look'd down on which  Their future Right and future Pow'r depends  Mean while the Sun the World's great Eye and Soul  With all his Pow'r seren'd th' Aetherial Space  That no invidious Cloud might intercept  Th' eternal Deeds of  Bleinheim  's wond'rous Day  Which shew'd a nobler Sight than all the World's  And all the Space immense that with one Kenn  He views could all afford him when it shew'd  So many Myriads of Heroick Souls  Resolve to conquer or devove themselves  In the great Cause of Liberty and Truth  The Nations here below had all their Eyes  Intent upon that Field on whose Event  Depended all their Freedom all their Peace  The very Elements attend in Truce  The dreadful Issue silent were the Winds  And hush'd the Voice of  Danube  's angry Roar  All Nature in all others Parts had Peace  Discord had now no Leisure to attend  Inferiour Strife for  Bleinheim  claim'd her all  For there were all her  Stygian  Snakes employ'd  There were the Fates and all the Furies there  Who shap'd like Faulcons waiting for their Prey  were perch'd on baleful Eughs by  Danube  's Shore  So that both Earth and Heav'n and Hell below  Times present past and future all appear'd  To be concern'd on that important Day  But heark The Goddess gives the dreadful Charge  I hear th' enchanting Sound I feel its Magick Pow'r  That Sound can like the last Angelick Trump  From their eternal Mansions rouze the Dead  That Magick Sound brings future times in view  And makes the past return that mighty Sound  Swift as the Movement of quick Thought transports  The Hearer to the World's remotest Ends  I feel I feel ev'n now that I am rapt  O'er Lands and Seas to  Bleinheim  's wond'rous Field  Do you see how the tempestuous Squadrons move  Like Clouds with Thunder charg'd along the Plain  Oh the transporting Sight The noble Sound  The sprightly Neighing of the Warlike Steed  And the impatient Champions eager Shouts  The Trumpets roar The Thunder of the Drum  How  Danube  rears his hoary Head aghast  Th' adjacent Forrest frightfully surveys  Th' adjacent Forrests darts a dreadful Gloom  And on his Floud with double Horror frowns  On to th' Attack the thund'ring Squadrons move  The very Heav'ns above them seem to smoak  And the resounding Earth beneath them shakes  The noble Rage of Battel fires the Plain  Me too the noble Fury has inspir'd  Of Registring in Fame's Eternal Roll  Their Actions worthy the recording Muse  The Daughter of Celestial Memory  And th' immortal Mother of Renown  Eternal Fame thy Summons I obey  Like them thy Charge great Goddess I obey  But while the Verse which thou inspir'st I sing  Do thou great Goddess thou my numerous Song  Accompany with that Angelick Trump  Whose Sound by all the list'ning Globe is heard  And to the World's remotest times descends  But now the Trumpet's Clangor's heard no more  No more th' impatient Warriors eager Shouts  For now the Cannon thunders thro' the Plain  And drowns all dreadful Noises in its own  The moving Squadrons are no longer seen  The very Earth and Heavens are seen no more  For Earth and Heav'ns seem all involv'd in Night  A Night of Dust and of tumultuous Smoak  Or hid in Brightness of tempestuous Flames  Too dazling to be pierc'd by mortal Eyes  But now the Goddess with Celestial Light  Dispells the Mist that veil'd these mortal Eyes  And now thro' Clouds of stormy Dust I see  Thro' curling Smoak thro' dazling Flames I see  Say Goddess what heroick Forms are those  Who the bold  Britons  lead impetuous on  Who between them and Danger interpose  And shield them with their very Breasts from Fate  At once in Danger foremost and Renown  Esteeming Glory cheaply bought with Life  And frankly off'ring up their noble Hearts  A great unblemish'd Sacrifice to thee  How each looks worthy of his high Command  Each looks as if on his heroick Deeds  The Fate depended of this dreadful Day  Ay now their Shapes distinctly I discern  Ay now I know the herolck Leaders well  And thou eternal Goddess knowst them well  And thou with all thy Hundred Tongues wilt spread  Their deathless Actions and extend their Praise  Wherever thou expand'st thy sounding Wings  Hail Race of Heroes  British  Worthies Hail  Hail noble  Churchill Lumley Villars Wood  And thou great  Ingolsby  great  Orkney  thou  Hail thou the foremost in the dire Assault  Brave  Cuts  the Lightning of the  British  Thunder  Great Favourites of Deathless Fame All Hail  Those are th' immortal Heroes whose Commands  The freeborn  English  joyfully obey  The Pride and Flow'r of  Britain  's Godlike Sons  Upon their Eyes the fierce Batallions gaze  And from their Beams derive a glorious Fire  And the Remembrance of great  Henry  's Days  Now after them they move impatient on  Impatient for the horrid Shock they earn  Now meet the  French  and we with hideous Noise  In Thunder Lightning and in Iron Hail  Y' Immortal Pow'rs assist  Britannia  's Cause  Assist ye bright Spectators of the Sky  The Cause of Justice and of Truth support  The Cause of all the Christian World defend  Ah miserable me Th' immortal Pow'rs  Either against their own great Cause declare  Or else blind Fortune governs all below  For see th' unconquer'd  English  are repell'd  Bright Honour is repell'd and Virtue lost  And false Ambition wins O dismal Sight  O dire Calamity Surprzing Fate That such  As fought like these should ever know repulse  Can they from such Heroick Chiefs retire  O can they poorly yield in such a Cause  No see they Rally with a noble Fire  And Shame grown Fury to the Charge returns  But to the Valour of the Foe I hate  I must do Justice here a braver Foe  By  Britain  's Godlike Sons was never charg'd  The  French  undaunted all their Fury meet  And all with double Fury they repel  And drive the  English  Horse like Lightning back  See how once more confounded they retire  O cursed Fate O Fortune O Despair  Aloud methinks I hear all Nature groan  Aloud methinks I hear th' immortal Pow'rs  Lament the Honour of  Britannia  lost  The wretched Fate of Liberty lament  O fond Imagination Vain Conceit  Immortal is the Date of Liberty  And  Britain  's Honour never can be lost  For see where now Heroick  Marlborough  comes  Comes to maintain them to revenge them comes  See where the dusty Squadrons he collects  As  Homer  's  Jove  convenes the threatning Clouds  That with his dire Artillery are fraught  With what exalted Air he leads them on  Terror before him marches Fame behind  And Conquest like the  Austrian  Eagle shap'd  Over his Head flies tow'ring to the Skies  With such Majestick Air in Ancient Days  Phidias  or great  Euphranor  form'd his  Jove  But warring  Jove  preparing to discharge  Vindictive Thunder on the impious World  Death his August Appearance sees from far  And sees him worthy all his direful Rage  T' attack him mounts upon a fiery Globe  But as more near the Griezly Monarch draws  He knows the Hero doom'd t' oercome by Fate  And then his fiery Thunderbolt he shoots  Into the Earth and all its Entrails tears  About the Hero casts a Mount of Clay  And buries him almost alive with Hast  To shun him sacred to eternal Fame  The Squadrons all with shudd'ring Horror shake  And Ruin from that dreadful Moment wait  He in that dreadful Moment is alone  Fearless and calmly of them all takes Care  An Intrepidity so like their own  Charms all the bright Spectators of the Sky  The Squadrons now redouble all their Rage  And catch Heroick Fortitude from him  Their Flame rekindled rages in their Breasts  And sparkling in their fatal Eyes it rowls  Unanimous they to the Charge return  With Resolution never seen before  Each Champions with the Fate of Nations big  All All resolve to conquer or to die  Ay now e'en now the dreadful Moment comes  On which the Destiny of Men depends  Their raging Blood like fiery Torrents rowls  Their Hearts e'en burst with Rage their noble Hearts  That utterly disdain that utterly abhor  Th' inglorious Thoughts of Flight or foul Retreat  Again with dreadful Shouts rhey rend the Skies  And now their murd'ring Carabines they sling  With matchless Rage their flaming Swords they draw  In missionary Death they trust no more  But in their Hands they carry hideous Fate  Now now with all their Might with all their Souls  They rush on Death and Wounds their dismal Way  With their protended bloody Points they plough  Or brandishing aloft the horrid Edge  Like ripen'd Corn the adverse Squadrons mow  Extending them in Heaps upon the Plain  The adverse Squadrons can no longer bear  Their fatal Weapons or their fatal Eyes  Or their victorious Cries but Slaughter some  Some Pain and Anguish seize Confusion all  And now in Heaps they fall in Crowds they fly  They fly fair  Europe  's proud Oppressors fly  And Godlike Liberty's for ever fix'd  And to the Stars is  England  's Glory rais'd  Victoria  the transported  Britons  cry  With Rapture  Bleinheim  's blissful Plain resounds  To  Bleinheim  's Field the ravish'd Heav'ns reply  And with victorious Shouts the  Welkin  rings  Both Heav'n and Earth and Gods and Men are charm'd  And  Phebus  with redoubled Glory shines  And on the blest Event all ravish'd Nature smiles  Danube  transported drives his rapid Floud  With double Fury by his ecchoing Shores  And to the  Euxin  sends th' enchanting Sound  Adown his Shores the Acclamation runs  That Godlike Liberty's for ever fix'd  And to the Stars is  England  's Glory rais'd  Oh Joy oh Rapture never to be born  They fly Fair  Europe  's proud Oppressors fly  The Victors rushing tear their trembling Rear  Shouting they rage and raging they pursue  A dismal Joy is on their ratling Tongues  Fate in their Arms and Fury in their Eyes  Now Discord stalking with Gigantick Stride  Wades through a Crimson Stream of torrent Gore  And hideous is the Face of Slaughter now  And yet e'en now when all the conq'ring Troops  Soldiers and Chiefs are all e'en wild with Joy  All frantick with the Transport of their Rage  Their great Commanders calm he who before  In his own Danger dauntless was alone  Lord of himself in universal Joy  Serenely doubts for all yet his the Praise  The Glory of th' immortal Day is his  He to a Pitch of human Glory rais'd  To which no Subject ever rose before  And by this great deciding Moment made  Darling of Nations and Mankinds Delight  Britannia  's second Pride  Batavia  's Hope  The  Roman  Empires Ornament and Fame  The everlasting Blessing of the Good  And constant Panegyrick of the Brave  E'n in this great deciding Moment he  Th' impetuous Movements of his Soul commands  Commands himself with more imperious Sway  Than e'en the meanest Warrior of his Troops  To no unruly Transport he gives way  To all Attacks remains invincible  And stands the noble Conqueror of himself  For now his Genius whispers him within  That while the Day is doubtless on his Side  Heroick  Eugene  is severely prest  And by the false  Bavarian  's Pow'r distrest  And wants the Succour of the Conq'ring Wing  Then as great  Virgil  's  Neptune  with his Voice  Tames the wild Horrors of his frantick Waves  And flattens with a Breath the refluent Main  So mighty  Marlborough  with a Word a Nod  The Fury of his Conq'ring Troops restrains  E'n raging Madness hears that awful Voice  And in a Moment sinks into a Calm  That Voice the stormy King of Terrors hears  He hears that Voice and in midway arrests  His furious Arm descending to destroy  And as the Hero with a Breath can calm  The raging Storm in forty thousand Breasts  So with a Breath he reinflames them all  Again like stormy Seas they waving rowl  And rise and foam with far resounding Roar  And tenfold Joy and tenfold Rage succeeds  For on the Spur the blissful News arrives  That happy  Eugene  no Support requires  That conqu'ring  Eugene  making vast Efforts  Efforts which ne'er will be forgot by Fame  A Third time rallied his disorder'd Troops  And turn'd Confusion back upon the Foe  Again great  Marlborough  gives the fatal Word  Again the Goddess gives the dreadful Charge  And the victorious Squadrons of the left  Again fall on with terrifying Cries  Conquest before now great Revenge they seek  The  French  astonish'd all Resistance loose  All Resolution Courage Order Thought  Their Squadrons now confounded all disband  Each for himself takes sordid Care alone  Sure Ruin both to Armies and to States  The Victors with immortal Rage pursue  And smite th' affected  French  like Wrath divine  That sweeps whole People and lays Nations waste  See this ye proud aspiring Tyrants see  And let the Face of  Bleinheim  's dreadful Field  Teach you to rremble at the Wrath of Heav'n  And the just Judgments of th' avenging God  Do you see that Heap of abject Wretches there  That fall by Hundreds and by Thousands fly  How is Ambition faln How in his Turn  The insolent Oppressor faints and dies  Are these the Brave th' Invincible Are these  The Royal Houshold of th' immortal King  Are these the Bands so proud of Triumphs past  So vain upon the Hopes of those to come  And with the Spoils of conquer'd Nations big  Are these the Gyants who their Tyrant swell'd  With the fond Hope of universal Sway  How they fly How they fall How they tremble How they die  An Iron Tempest galls them in the Flank  And the fierce Victor with ten thousand Swords  Insulting hangs upon their broken Rear  Before them  Danube  rises on their Flight  And loudly for Revenge Revenge he roars  Arresting their precipitated Flight  He strikes them backward with his stormy Brow  Or with his angry Voice their guilty Souls he scares  But tenfold Horror drives them headlong on  Down down ten thousand take the fatal Leap  And plunge among the Waves the  Danube  raves  And calls his stormy Billows to the Spoil  His stormy Billows to the mighty Spoil  Drive on advancing with a hideous Roar  Ten thousand Warriors rowling ln the Floud  Horses and Men reverst midst scatter'd Arms  And floating Ensigns on each other Plunge  Drive one another drowning to th' Abyss  And with tremendous Prospect strike the Eye  The very Victors grow with Horror chill  Shake at the dire Catastrophe they cause  And tremble at the Terrors of a Scene  Such as no no Nation of the World no Age  Since the great  Hebrews  wond'rous Passage saw  Here Heavenly Goddess couldst thou but impart  To my weak Mind the Force th' immortal Force  To paint with lively Strokes the dismal Scene  To paint the Cries the Shrieks the dying Groans  The Grief the Rage the Fury of their Fear  And all the Horrors of their baleful Eyes  And all th' Astonishment th' Amazement of their Souls  With ev'ry dreadful ghastful Circumstance  Not  Milton  's wond'rousPiece should mine transcend  In which  Messiah  with his Thunders arm'd  Drove down th' infernal Tyrants warring Host  With Terrors and with Furies thro' th' Abyss  Not  Michael  Angelo's stupendous Work  Where the last dreadful Doom sends guilty Souls  Down to eternal Punishments in Hell  Hell seizes them Hell meets them on the Way  For in their Air and in their Looks is Hell  And endless Torments in their Baleful Eyes  Thus fell the  French  before the Victor's Wrath  They who had stood so many Storms of War  Yet still unshaken kept their Ground in all  Thus of tall Oaks I've known a goodly Row  That grac'd the winding Margin of the Floud  Defy the Rage of many a wintry Blast  The Tempest saw their Strength and sigh'd and past them by  But when a Hurrican by Wrath divine  Came lately bellowing o'er the Western Main  That with immortal Fury on them fell  That made them tremble at impending Fate  And rent at once their sturdy Trunks in twain  Or twisted up their Roots and whirl'd them in the Air  That tore their lofty Branches down from Heav'n  And brought to light theirSerpent Roots fromHell  Down they came rushing with a fatal Groan  And strew'd the River with their scatter'd Limbs  And with their mangled Trunks his Channel pil'd  Till Devastation choak'd the incumber'd Stream  O Conqu'ring Death like  Sampson  blind tho' strong  Hadst thou the glorious Hecatombs foreseen  Which noble  Marlborough  was ordain'd by Fate  To offer up to thy insatiate Pow'r  Thou surely then hadst sav'd one Godlike Youth  And to th' Heroick Father giv'n the Son  But  Blanford  in his early Bloom was snatch'd  To make the Glory of the Sire compleat  Had noble  Blandford  still remain'd below  He was good so charming and so great  So worthy all the Fathers fond Desire  Th' invidious World might have pretended then  That  Marlboro'  had atchiev'd his Godlike Deeds  For private Ends to make his Offspring great  Now clearly for his Country and his Queen  For Liberty and for the World he acts  Thou too great Queen by whose auspicious Care  And Wisdom these astonishing Events  Were brought to Light thou for thy Country act'st  And for the World for Children thou hast none  Too rigid Fate has ravish'd all away  Oh Royal  Gloucester  had but cruel Death  Permitted thee to see this wond'rous Day  How had great  Marlbro  's Actions rais'd thy Blood  And rouz'd the Hero in thy Blooming Breast  Till grown impatient thou hadst call'd to Arms  Hadst like young  Edward  crost the ambient Main  Attended with the Flow'r of  British  Youth  Display'd thy Ensigns in the  Galliek  Plains  While  France  had trembled at thy conq'ring Arms  Once more had  France  an  English  Sovereign own'd  Once more had  Spain  its rightful Monarch seen  Plac'd by a  British  Hero on his Throne  But thou art gone  Britannia  's Hope is gone  For thee  Britannia  mourns like Royal  Ann  Thy Fate thy Mother's Happiness impair'd  But it has rais'd her Glory to the Stars  The Wonders which she ev'ry Day performs  Mov'd by the noblest Motives she performs  Now for her Conntry and the World she acts  For Liberty the Darling Cause of Earth  For spotless Faith the darling Cause of Heav'n  Her Children all were snatch'd away in thee  O fond Mistake Whate'er the best of Queens  Performs she does it for her Children all  Her happy People are her Children now  And oh so good so excellent is she  So tender of their Happiness and Fame  So watchful o'er their Rights so studious of their Peace  To all extending her impartial Care  So grateful and so dutiful are they  Such Honour and such awful Love return  Such Love as Heav'n of Human Hearts requires  That Fame is doubtful which she most shall praise  The Childrens Duty or the Mother's Care  The Dutiful'st of Children sure are they  The very Best of tender Mothers she  And not the fancied Mother of the Gods  Great Queen could boast a more Heroick Race  And as that fancied Mother of the Gods  Was charm'd at Sight of her immortal Sons  With all my Pow'r I've rouzed my Genius up  That thy victorious Subjects thou mightst see  Made like to Gods at  Bleinheim  's deathless Field▪  What glorious Sight can more delight thy Soul  Than Conquest which thy Subjects Bliss ensures  Thy Glory and the World's Felicity  Yes  Bleinheim  still can shew a nobler Sight  A Sight that for thy Zeal has stronger Charms  Than all the World's vain Greatness can supply▪  See there thy conq'ring Heroes who before  Were like to Gods now equal to the Worm  All low and prostrate as the vanquish'd now  Humbling themselves before the God of Hosts  Off'ring to him the Glory and the Praise  The Sacrifice most worthy of the God  Th' Almighty God of War the God of great Revenge  FINIS
