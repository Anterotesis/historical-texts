the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain  They will call to mind that at the end of the first part he was returning home full of gratitude for the favours he had received from Mr Johnson whom we left pursuing his journey after having promised to make a visit to the Shepherd's Cottage  Mr Johnson after having passed some time with his friend sat out on his return to Salisbury and on the Saturday evening reached a very small  inn a mile or two distant from the Shepherd's Village for he never travelled on a Sunday He went the next morning to the Church nearest the house where he had passed the night and after taking such refreshment as he could get at that house he walked on to find out the Shepherd's cottage His reason for visiting him on a Sunday was chiefly because he supposed it to be the only day which the Shepherd's employment allowed him to pass at home with his family and as Mr Johnson had been struck with his talk he thought it would be neither unpleasant nor unprofitable to observe how a Man who carried such an appearance of piety spent his Sunday for though he was so low in the world this Gentleman was not above entering very closely into his character of which he thought he should be able to form a better judgment by seeing whether his practice at home kept pace with his professions abroad For it is not so much by observing how people talk as how they live  that we ought to judge of their characters  After a pleasant walk Mr Johnson got within sight of the cottage to which he was directed by the clump of hawthorns and the broken chimney He wished to take the family by surprise and walking gently up to the house he stood awhile to listen The door being half open he saw the Shepherd who looked so respectable in his Sunday Coat that he should hardly have known him his Wife and their numerous young family drawing round their little table which was covered with a clean though very coarse cloth There stood on it a large dish of potatoes a brown pitcher and a piece of coarse loaf The wife and children stood in silent attention while the Shepherd with uplifted hands and eyes devoutly begged the blessing of heaven on their hornely fare Mr Johnson could not help sighing to reslect that he had sometimes  seen better dinners eaten with less appearance of thankfulness  The Shepherd and his wife then sat down with great seeming cheerfulness but the children stood and while the mother was helping them little freshcoloured Molly who had picked the wool from the bushes with so much delight cried out "Father I wish I was big enough to say grace I am sure I should say it very heartily today for I was thinking what must  poor  people do who have no salt to their potatoes and do but look our dish is quine full""this is the true way of thinking Molly" said the Father "in whatever concerns bodily wants and bodily comforts it is our duty to compare our own lot with the lot of those who are worse off and this will keep us thankful On the other hand whenever we are tempted to set up our own wisdom or goodness we must compare ourselves with those who are wiser and better and that will keep us humble" Molly was now so hungry and found the potatoes so good that she had no time to make  any more remarks but was devouring her dinner very heartily when the barking of the great dog drew her attention from her trencher to the door and spying the stranger she cried out "Look father see here if yonder is not the good Gentleman" Mr Johnson finding himself discovered immediately walived in and was heartily welcomed by the honest Shepherd who told his wise that this was the Gentleman to whom they were so much obliged  The good Woman began as some very neat people are rather too apt to do with making many apologies that her house was not cleaner and that things were not in fitter order to receive such a Gentleman Mr Johnson however on looking round could discover nothing but the most perfect neatness The trenchers on which they were eating were almost as white as their linen and notwithstanding the number and smallness of the children there was not the least appearance  of dart or inter The furniture was very simple and poor hardly indeed amounting to bare necessaries It consisted of four brown wooden chairs which by constant rubbing were become as bright as a looking glass an iron pot and kettle a poor old grate which scarcely held a handful of coals and our of which the little fire that had been in it appeared to have been taken as soon as it had answered the end for which it had been lighted that of boiling their potatoes Over the chimney stood an old fashioned broad bright candlestick and a still brighter spit it was pretty clear that this last was kept rather for ornament than use An old carved elbow chair and a chest of the same date which stood in the corner were considered as the most valuable part of the Shepherd's goods having been in his family for three generations But all these were lightly esteemed by him in comparison of another possession which added to the above made up the whole of what he had inherited from  his father and which last he would not have parted with if no other could have been had for a king's ransom this was a large old Bible which lay on the window seat neatly covered with brown cloth variously patched This sacred book was most reverendly preserved from dog's ears dirt and every other injury but such as time and much use had made it suffer in spite of care On the clean white walls were pasted a hymn on the Crucifixion of our Saviour a print of the Prodigal Son the Shepherd's Hymn and a  New History of a True Book  After the first salutations were over Mr Johnson said that if they would go on quietly with their dinner he would sit down Though a good deal ashamed they thought it more respectful to obey the Gentleman who having cast his eye on their slender provisions gently rebuked the Shepherd for not having indulged himself as it was Sunday with a morsel of Bacon to relish his Potatoes The Shepherd  said nothing but poor Mary coloured and hung down her head saying "indeed Sir it is not my fault I did beg my husband to allow himself a bit of meat today out of your honour's bounty but he was too good to do it and it is all for my sake" The Shepherd seemed unwilling to come to an explanation but Mr Johnson desired Mary to go on So she continued "you must know Sir that both of us next to a sin dread a debt and indeed in some cases a debt is a sin but with all our care and pains we have never been able quite to pay off the Doctor's bill for that bad fit of the Rheumatism which I had last winter Now when you were pleased to give my husband that kind present the other day I heartily desired him to buy a bit of meat for Sunday as I said before that he might have a little refreshment for himself out of your kindness But answered he Mary it is never out of my mind long together that we still owe a few shillings to the Doctor and thank God it is all we did  owe in the world Now if I carry him this money directly it will not only shew him our honesty and our good will but it will be an encouragement to him to come to you another time in case you should be taken once more in such a bad fit for I must own added my poor husband that the thought of your being so terribly ill without any help is the only misfortune that I want courage to face"  Here the grateful womans tears ran down so fast that she could not go on She wiped them with the corner of her apron and humbly begged pardon for making so free "Indeed Sir" said the Shepherd "though my wife is full as unwilling to be in debt as myself yet I could hardly prevail on her to consent to my paying this money just then because she said it was hard I should not have a taste of the Gentleman's bounty myself But for once Sir I would have my own way For you must know as I pass best part of my time alone tending my sheep 'tis  a great point with me Sir to get comfortable matter for my own thoughts so that 'tis rather self interest in me to allow myself in no pleasures and no practices that won't bear thinking on over and over For when one is a good deal alone you know Sir all one's bad deeds do so rush in upon one as I may say and so torment one that there is no true comfort to be had but in keeping clear of wrong doings and false pleasures and that I suppose may be one reason why so many folks hate to stay a bit by themselvesBut as I was sayingwhen I came to think the matter over on the hill yonder said I to myself a good dinner is a good thing I grant and yet it will be but cold comfort to me a week after to be able to sayto be sure I had a nice shoulder of mutton last Sunday for dinner thanks to the good Gentleman but then I am in debtI  had  a rare dinner that's certain but the pleasure of that has long been over and the debt still remains I have spent the crown and now if my poor wife should be taken  in one of those fits again die she must unless God work a miracle to prevent it for I can get no help for her This thought settled all and I set off directly and paid the crown to the Doctor with as much cheerfulness as I should have felt on sitting down to the fattest shoulder of mutton that ever was roasted And if I was contented at the time think how much more happy I have been at the remembrance O Sir there are no pleasures worth the name but such as bring no plague or penitence after them"  Mr Johnson was satisfied with the Shepherd's reasons and agreed that though a good dinner was not to be despised yet it was not worthy to be compared with  a contented Mind which  as the Bible truly says  is a continual feast  "But come" said the good Gentleman "what have we got in this brown mug" "As good water" said the Shepherd "as any in the king's dominions I have heard of countries beyond sea in which there is no wholesome  water nay I have been myself in a great town not far off where they are obliged to buy all the water they get while a good Providence sends to my very door a spring as clear and fine as Jacob's well When I am tempted to repine that I have often no other drink I call to mind that it was nothing better than a cup of cold water which the woman of Samaria drew for the greatest guest that ever visited this world"  "Very well" replied Mr Johnson "but as your honesty has made you prefer a poor meal to being in debt I will at least send and get something for you to drink I saw a little publichouse just by the church as I came along Let that little rosyfaced fellow fetch a mug of beer"  So saying he looked full at the Boy who did not offer to stir but cast an eye at his father to know what he was to do "Sir" said the Shepherd "I hope we shall not appear ungrateful if we seem to refuse  your favour my little boy would I am sure fly to serve you on any other occasion But good Sir it is Sunday and should any of my family be seen at a Publichouse on a Sabbathday it would be a much greater grief to me than to drink water all my life I am often talking against these doings to others and if I should say one thing and do another you can't think what an advantage it would give many of my neighbours over me who would be glad enough to report that they caught the Shepherd's Son at the Alehouse without explaining how it happened Christians you know Sir must be doubly watchful or they will not only bring disgrace on themselves but what is much worse on that holy name by which they are called"  "Are you not a little too cautious my honest friend" said Mr Johnson "I humbly ask your pardon Sir" replied the Shepherd "if I think that is impossible In my poor notion  I no more understand how a man can be too cautious than how he can be too strong or too healthy"  "You are right indeed" said Mr Johnson "as a general principle but this struck me as a very small thing" "Sir" said the Shepherd "I am afraid you will think me very bold but you encourage me to speak out""'Tis what I wish" said the Gentleman "Then Sir" resumed the Shepherd "I doubt if where there is a temptation to do wrong any thing can be called small that is in short if there is any such thing as a small wilful sin A poor man like me is seldom called out to do great things so that it is not by a few great deeds his character can be judged by his neighbours but by the little round of daily customs he allows himself in"While they were thus talking the children who had stood very quietly behind and had not stirred a foot now began to scamper about all at once and in a moment ran  to the windowseat to pick up their  little old hats Mr Johnson looked surprised at this disturbance the Shepherd asked his pardon telling him it was the sound of the Church Bell which had been the cause of their rudeness for their Mother had brought them up with such a fear of being too late for Church that it was but who  could catch the first stroke of the bell and be first ready He had always taught them to think that nothing was more indecent than to get into Church after it was begun for as the service opened with an exhortation to repentance and a confession of sin it looked very presumptuous not to be ready to join in it it looked as if people did not feel themselves to be sinners And though such as lived at a great distance might plead difference of clocks as an excuse yet those who lived within the sound of the bell could pretend neither ignorance nor mistake  Mary and her children set forward Mr Johnson and the Shepherd followed taking care to talk the whole way on such subjects as might fit them for the solemn duties of the place to which they were going "I have often been sorry to observe" said Mr Johnson "that many who are reckoned decent good kind of people and who would on no account neglect going  to church yet seem to care but little in what frame or temper of mind they go thither They will talk of their worldly concerns till they get within the door and then take them up again the very minute the sermon is over which makes me ready to fear they lay too much stress on the mere form of going to a place of worship Now for my part I always find that it requires a little time to bring my mind into a state fit to do any  common  business well much more this great and most necessary business of all" "Yes Sir" said the Shepherd "and then I think too how busy I should be in preparing my mind if I was going into the presence of a great gentleman or a Lord or the King and shall the King of Kings be treated with less respect Besides one likes to see people feel as if going to Church was a thing of choice and pleasure as well as a duty and that they were as desirous not be the last there as they would be if they were going to a feast or a fair"  After service Mr Jenkins the Clergyman who was well acquainted with the character of Mr Johnson and had a great respect for him accosted him with much civility expressing his concern that he could not enjoy just now so much of his conversation as he wished as he was obliged to visit a sick person at a distance but hoped to have a little talk with him before he left the Village As they walked along together Mr Johnson made such inquiries about the Shepherd as served to confirm him in the high opinion he entertained of his piety goodsense industry and selfdenial They parted the Clergyman promising to call in at the Cottage in his way home  The Shepherd who took it for granted that Mr Johnson was gone to the Parsonage walked home with his wife and children and was beginning in his usual way to catechise and instruct his family when Mr Johnson came in and insisted that the Shepherd should go on with his instructions just as if  he were not there This Gentleman who was very desirous of being useful to his own Servants and workmen in the way of religious instruction was sometimes sorry to find that though he took a good deal of pains they did not now and then quite understand him for though his meaning was very good he language was not always very plain and though the  things  he said were not hard to be understood yet the  words  were especially to such as were very ignorant And he now began to find out that if people were ever so wise and good yet if they had not a simple agreeable and familiar way of expressing themselves some of their plain hearers would not be much the better for them For this reason he was not above listening to the plain humble way in which this honest man taught his family for though he knew that he himself had many advantages over the Shepherd had more learning and could teach him many things yet he was not too proud to learn even of so poor a Man in any point where  he thought the Shepherd might have the advantage of him  This Gentleman was much pleased with the knowledge and piety he discovered in the answers of the children and desired the Shepherd to tell him how he contrived to keep up a sense of divine things in his own mind and in that of his family with so little leisure and so little reading "O as to that Sir" said the Shepherd "we do not read much except in one book to be sure but by hearty prayer for God's blessing on the use of that book what little knowledge is needful seems to come of course as it were And my chief study has been to bring the fruits of the Sunday reading into the week's business and to keep up the same sense of GOD in the heart when the Bible is in the cupboard as when it is in the hand In short to apply what I read in the book to what I meet with in the Field"  "I don't quite understand you" said Mr Johnson "Sir" replied the Shepherd "I have but a poor gift at conveying these things to others though I have much comfort from them in my own mind but I am sure that the most ignorant and hard working people who are in earnest about their salvation may help to keep up devout thoughts and good affections during the week though they have hardly any time to look at a bookAnd it will help them to keep out bad thoughts too which is no small matter But then they must know the Bible they must have read the word of God that is a kind of stock in trade for a Christian to set up with and it is this which makes me so diligent in teaching it to my children and even in storing their memories with Psalms and Chapters This is a great help to a poor hardworking Man who will hardly meet with any thing but what he may turn to some good account If one lives in the fear and the love of GOD almost every  thing one sees abroad will teach one to adore his power and goodness and bring to mind some texts of Scripture which shall fill the heart with thankfulness and the mouth with praise When I look upwards  the Heavens declare the glory of God  and shall I be silent and ungrateful if I look round and see the Vallies standing thick with Corn how can I help blessing that Power who  giveth me all things richly to enjoy  I may learn gratitude from the beasts of the Field for the  Ox knoweth his Owner and the Ass his Master's Crib  and shall a Christian not know and shall a Christian not consider what great things GOD has done for him I who am a Shepherd endeavour to fill my soul with a constant remembrance of that good Shepherd who  feedeth me in green pastures and maketh me to lie down beside the still waters and whose rod and staff comfort me"  "You are happy" said Mr Johnson "in this retired life by which  you escape the corruptions of the world" "Sir" "said the Shepherd "I do not escape the corruptions of my own evil nature Even there on that wild solitary hill I can find out that my heart is prone to evil thoughts I suppose Sir that different states have different temptations You great folks that live in the world perhaps are exposed to some of which such a poor man as I am know nothing But to one who leads a lonely life like me evil thoughts are a chief besetting Sin and I can no more withstand these without the grace of God than a rich Gentleman can withstand the snares of evil company without the same grace And I feel that I stand in need of God's help continually and if he should give me up to my own evil heart I should be lost"  Mr Johnson approved of the Shepherd's sincerity for he had always observed that where there was no humility and no watchfulness against Sin there was no religion and he said that  the Man who did not feel himself to be a sinner in his opinion could not be a christian  Just as they were in this part of their discourse Mr Jenkins the Clergyman came in After the usual salutations he said "Well Shepherd I wish you joy I know you will be sorry to gain any advantage by the death of a neighbour but old Wilson my Clerk was so infirm and I trust so well prepared that there is no reason to be sorry for his death I have been to pray by him but he died while I staid I have always intended you should succeed to his place 'tis no great matter but every little is something"  "No great matter Sir" "cried the Shepherd "indeed it is a great thing to me it will more than pay my rent Blessed be GOD for all his goodness" Mary said nothing but lifted up her eyes full of tears in silent gratitude  "I am glad of this little circumstance" said Mr Jenkins "not only for your sake but for the sake of the office itself I so heartily reverence every religious institution that I would never have even the  Amen  added to the excellent prayers of our Church by vain or profane lips and if it depended on me there should be no such thing in the land as an idle drunken or irreligious Parish Clerk Sorry I am to say that this matter is not always sufficiently attended to and that I know some of a very indifferent character"  Mr Johnson now inquired of the Clergyman whether there were many children in the Parish "More than you would expect" replied he "from the seeming smallness of it but there are some little Hamlets which you do not see" "I think" returned Mr Johnson "I recollect that in the conversation I had with the Shepherd on the hill yonder he told me you had no Sunday School" "I am sorry to  say we have none" said the Minister "do what I can to remedy this misfortune by public catechising but having two or three Churches to serve I cannot give so much time as I wish to private instruction and having a large family of my own and no assistance from others I have never been able to establish a School"  "There is an excellent institution in London" said Mr Johnson "called the SundaySchool Society which kindly gives books and other helps on the application of such pious Ministers as stand in need of their aid and which I am sure would have assisted you but I think we shall be able to do something ourselvesShepherd" continued he "if I was a King and had it in my power to make you a rich and a great Man with a word speaking I would not do it Those who are raised by some sudden stroke much above the station in which divine Providence had placed them seldom turn out very good or very happy I have never  had any great things in my power but as far as I have been able I have been always glad to assist the worthy I have however never attempted or desired to set any poor Man much above his natural condition but it is a pleasure to me to lend him such assistance as may make that condition more easy to himself and to put him in a way which shall call him to the performance of more duties than perhaps he could have performed without my help and of performing them in a better mannerWhat Rent do you pay for this Cottage"  "Fifty Shillings a Year Sir"  "It is in a sad tattered condition is there not a better to be had in the Village"  "That in which the poor Clerk lived" said the Clergyman "is not only more tight and whole but has two decent chambers and a very large  light kitchen""That will be very convenient" replied Mr Johnson "pray what is the Rent" "I think" said the Shepherd "poor neighbour Wilson gave somewhat about four pounds a year or it might be guineas""Very well" said Mr Johnson "and what will the Clerk's place be worth think you" "About three pounds" was the answer  "Now" continued Mr Johnson "my plan is that the Shepherd should take that house immediately for as the poor Man is dead there will be no need of waiting till quarter day if I make up the difference" "True Sir" said Mr Jenkins "and I am sure my Wife's Father whom I expect tomorrow will willingly assist a little towards buying some of the Clerk's old goods And the sooner they remove the better for poor Mary caught that bad rheumatism by sleeping under a leaky thatch" The Shepherd was too much moved to speak and Mary could hardly sob out "Oh Sir you  are too good indeed this house will do very well" "It may do very well for you and your children Mary" said Mr Johnson gravely "but it will not do for a School the kitchen is neither large nor light enough Shepherd" continued he "with your good Minister's leave and kind assistance I propose to set up in this parish a Sunday School and to make you the Master It will not at all interfere with your weekly calling and it is the only lawful way in which you could turn the Sabbath into a day of some little profit to your family by doing as I hope a great deal of good to the Souls of others The rest of the week you will work as usual The difference of rent between this house and the Clerk's I shall pay myself for to put you into a better house at your own expence would be no great act of kindnessAs for honest Mary who is not fit for hard labour or any outofdoor work I propose to endow a small weekly school of which she shall be the Mistress and employ her notable turn to  good account by teaching ten or a dozen girls to knit sew spin card or any other useful way of getting their bread for all this I shall only pay her the usual price for I am not going to make you rich but useful"  "Not rich Sir" cried the Shepherd "How can I ever be thankful enough for such blessings And will my poor Mary have a dry thatch over he had and shall I be able to send for the Doctor when I am like to lose her Indeed my cup runs over with blessings I hope God will give me humility" Here he and Mary looked at each other and burst into tears The Gentleman saw their distress and kindly walked out upon the little green before the door that these honest people might give vent to their feelings As soon as they were alone they crept into one corner of the room where they thought they could not be seen and fell on their knees devoutly blessing and praising GOD for his mercies Never were heartier  prayers presented than this grateful couple offered up for their benefactors The warmth of their gratitude could only be equalled by the earnestness with which they besought the blessing of GOD on the work in which they were going to engage  The two Gentlemen now left this happy family and walked to the Parsonage where the evening was spent in a manner very edifying to Mr Johnson who the next day took all proper measures for putting the Shepherd in immediate possession of his now comfortable habitation Mr Jenkins's fatherinlaw the worthy Gentleman who gave the Shepherd's Wife the blankets in the first part of this history arrived at the Parsonage before Mr Johnson left it and assisted in fitting up the Clerk's Cottage  Mr Johnson took his leave promising to call on the worthy Minister and his new Clerk once a year in his Summer's journey over the Plain as  long as it should please GOD to spare his lifeWe hope he will never fail to give us an account of these visits which we shall be glad to lay
