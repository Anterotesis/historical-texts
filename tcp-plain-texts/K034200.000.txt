 THE CHAPTER of ACCIDENTS A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS  PRICE ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE  THE Chapter of Accidents A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN THE  HAYMARKET  WRITTEN by MISS LEE  LONDON Printed for T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXXX  To MRS P  OH thou who bad'st me fearless try the oar  And launch uncertain on life's flatt'ring sea  Urging with trembling hand my bark from shore  While wond'ring at thy own temerity  Nameless as are thy merits still remain  Yet let thy heart appropriate all its dues  And oh whate'er th' event do thou retain  The tender titles of my Friend and Muse  Should Fortune's fav'rites circling close her throne  And Fame's loud trump be mute to me alone  The pity of the world I can return  And still at unsuccessful Fiction spurn  While Heav'n's supreme indulgence gives to me  Its charms combin'd and realiz'd in thee  PREFACE  THE aversion a woman ought to feel at the necessity of engaging even in a literary contest has induced me to endure a variety of imputations yet to publish a piece and leave all unanswered might at once give a sanction to the past and encourage future slanderslet this plead my excuse for introducing myself to those who have so generously received a comedy I would wish more worthy their patronage  Charged early in life with the care of a family I accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a prison where the perjury of an enemy and the injustice of a judge for a time confined him To amuse some of my melancholy leisure I there from a fondness for Marmontel's beautiful tale of Lauretta first conceived the design of introducing into the Drama a female heart capable of frailty yet shuddering at vice and perhaps sufficiently punished in her own feelings A lover whose error was likewise in his heart not head and even for him I contrived a chastisement in the agony of losing her nor did I imagine in adopting a religious tenet I could ever be accused of offending morality Subsequent characters and incidents arose in the manner they now appear except that the governor had then no place in it It is now seven years since the piece was brought thus forward soon after which a friend lent me a translation of Monsieur Diderot's Pere de FamilleThis fine performance gave me infinite pleasure under all the disadvantages of a translation and the chancesimilitude  which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me since conscious of my own originality and imagining even my worst enemy if he charged me with a plagiarism would at least allow while the subject was new to our stage my only crime was in denying itI returned the translated play and mine lay dormant several years Sentiment was now exploded and I therefore sought to diversify it with humour The character of the austere Commander in Monsieur Diderot's play had particularly pleased me and not being mistress of the French language I sought in vain for a translation on purpose to interweave him into mine Not able to meet with any I created the character of Governor Harcourt whose chief likeness to the French uncle is in name and heightened the piece with every event relative to him but an unbounded partiality I must ever retain for music made me finish it as a three act opera  In the interim my father had been engaged as a capital Actor by Mr Harris Life opened gradually upon me and dissipated the illusions of imagination I learnt that merit merely is a very insufficient recommendation to managers in general and as I had neither a prostituted pen or person to offer Mr Harris I gave up without a trial all thoughts of the Drama and sought an humble home in Bath resolving to bury in my own heart its little talent and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author Some valuable friends I had long possessed there insisted I should be wanting to myself in consigning this piece voluntarily to oblivion and offered me a recommendation to Mr Harris with a promise of concealing my name unless it was accepted I could desire nothing more and under these circumstances it was put into that gentleman's  hands above a twelvemonth ago The praises he gave it induced my friend to own my name and from that moment let his conscience tell him why it sunk in Mr Harris's favour He said he had frequently refused a play of Mr Macklin's taken from le Pere de Famille and could not accept another on the same subject insisted that the serious part of mine was all Diderot's advised me to cut it entirely out and convert the humorous part into an afterpiece which be would bring out in the course of the seasonReasons very remote from the Stage could alone induce me to listen a moment to his proposal and those brought me a hundred miles to converse with him on the subject when he produced me the copy sent him so worn out and dirty that I had reason to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew at leastI was enough mistress of myself to listen with complaisance to the most supercilious and unmeaning criticisms and agreed to mutilate it according to his ideas The Actors were now named I had every reason to imagine it a settled thing and returning to Bath sent the reduced copy at the appointed time viz early in September A month elapsed without my even knowing he had received it when with the continued illmanners of addressing me by a third person for he never wrote a single line in answer to several letters I was shewn a paragraph from Mr Harris by the friend already mentioned importing that I "had sent him  four  acts instead of  two  and must still take away half adding that he advised me by all means to retain my own disregarding Diderot's"I did retain my own for as the manuscript was luckily returned for another alteration I thought it time to consider what was due to myself and that the character of mildness and complacency would be rather dearly  bought if I gave up all merit for it I therefore wrote him a civil letter and finally withdrew it  I shall not expatiate on this treatment I was perhaps in some degree blameable for believing that man would set any value on my time or my money who knew not the value of his own nay I may be in reality obliged to him in one sense since his acceptance of my Comedy would inevitably have consigned to oblivion those parts of it honored with the most lavish applause  What pleasure do I feel in retracting the general aspersion cast upon managers when I speak of Mr ColmanObliged to get the piece represented if possible lest the subject should be borrowed an evil too common of late I enclosed it with an anonymous letter to that Gentleman briefly relating these particulars and it was left at his house early in the year by an unknown person At the expiration of a fortnight the manuscript or his answer was demanded and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and decisive Mr Colman thought the general name of Author entitled to the compliment of his own handwriting and by a flattering opinion and immediate acceptance of my piece encouraged me to avow myself By his advice I cut out the songs and lengthened it into five acts Nor did his kindness end there He gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience both in heightening and abbreviating the business with every attention in casting and getting it up generously uniting to the name of Manager that of Friend Mr Colman has brought into notice a woman who will ever with pride and pleasure acknowledge the obligation  PROLOGUE  Written by  GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Mr PALMER  LONG has the passive stage howe'er absurd  Been rul'd by  names  and govern'd by a  word  Some poor  cant term  like magick spells can awe  And bind our realms like a dramatic law  When Fielding Humour's fav'rite child appear'd  Low  was the worda word each author fear'd  'Till chac'd at length by pleasantry's bright ray  Nature and mirth resum'd their legal sway  And Goldsmith's genius bask'd in open day  No beggar howe'er poor a cur can lack  Poor bards of critic curs can keep a  pack  One yelper silenc'd twenty barkers rise  And with new  bowls  their  snarlings  still disguise  Low  banish'd the word  sentiment  succeeds  And at that shrine the modern playwright bleeds  Hard fate but let each wou'dbe critic know  That  sentiments  from genuine  feelings  flow  Critics in vain declaim and write and rail  Nature eternal Nature will prevail  Give me the bard who makes me laugh and cry  Diverts and moves and all I scarce know why  Untaught by commentators French or Dutch  Passion still answers to th' electric touch  Reason like Falstaff claims when all is done  The honors of the field already won  Tonight our author's is a mixt intent  Passion and humour  low  and  sentiment  Smiling in tearsa seriocomic play  Sunshine and show'ra kind of AprilDay  A Lord whose pride is in his honor plac'd  A governor with av'rice not disgrac'd  An humble priest a lady and a lover  So full of virtue  some of it runs over  No temporary touches no allusions  To camps reviews and all our late confusions  No personal reflections no sharp satire  But a mere chapterfrom the book of Nature  Wrote by a woman too the muses now  Few liberties to naughty men allow  But like old maids on earth resolv'd to vex  With cruel coyness treat the other sex  PERSONS  Lord Glenmore  Mr BENSLEY

bid the butler send me a bottle of hock  Throws himself along the hall chairs wiping his forehead  Phew the months have jumbled out of their places and we have July in September  Enter Mrs  Warner  War  Servant Mr Vane  Vane  Ah my dear creature how have you done these fifty ages  War  Why methinks you are grown mighty grand or you would have come to the stillroom to ask will you chuse any chocolate  Vane  Why don't you see I am deadabsolutely dead and if you was to touch me I should shake to meer dust like an Egyptian mummy Because it was not provoking enough to lounge away a whole summer in the country here am I driven up to town as if the devil was at my heels in the shape of our hopeful heir who has neither suffered my Lord nor me to rest one moment thro' his confounded impatience to see his uncle  War  Umphhe'll have enough of the old gentleman presently He is the very moral of my poor dear lady his sister who never was at peace herself nor suffer'd any one else to be so Such a house as we have had ever since he camewhy he is more full of importance and airs than a bailiff in possession and hectors over Miss Mortimer 'till she almost keeps her chamber to avoid him  Vane  Hates Miss Mortimerwhy here 'll be the devil to pay about her I suppose  War  Hate her ay that he does He look'd as if he could have kill'd her the moment she came down to see him and got into his chamber presently after where he sends for me"Who is this young woman Mrs What's your name" says he Why sir says I she is the orphan of a Colonel Mortimer whose intimacy with my Lord says I"Pho pho says he all that I know woman what does she do in this house" says he his face wrinkling all over  like cream when it's skimming Why sir says I her father unluckily died just before the Duke his brother and so could not leave her one shilling of all that fine fortune so my Lord intends to marry her to Mr Woodville says I"He does cries he heav'n be prais'd I'm come in time to mar that dainty project however You may go woman and tell Miss I don't want any thing more tonight"So up goes I to Miss Mortimer and tells her all this Lord how glad she was to find he intended to break the match tho' she can't guess what he means  Vane  Upon my soul I think it is full as hard to guess what she means What the devil will not my Lord's title fortune and only son be a great catch for a girl without a friend or a shilling  War  Ay but I could tell you a little story would explain allYou must know  sitting down a loud knocking  Vane  starts up  Zounds here's my Lord  Exeunt confusedly  SCENE  An Antichamber  Lord  Glenmore  and the  Governor  meet the latter hobbling  L Glen  You are welcome to England brother I am sorry your native air pays you so ill a compliment after sixteen years absence  Gov  'Faith my Lord and so am I too I promise you I put up with these things tolerably well in the Indies I did not go there to be happy but  after all my labours to find I have just got the money when it is out of my power to enjoy it is a cursed strokelike a fine ship of war I am only come home to be dismasted and converted into an hospital However I am glad  you  hold it better I don't think you look'd as well when we parted My sister poor Susan she is gone toowell we can never live a day the longer for thinking on't Where's Frank is he still the image of his mother  L Glen  Just as you left him but that the innocence of the boy is dignified by the knowledge of the man  Gov  He will hardly remember his old uncleI did love the rogue that's the truth on't and never look'd at my moneybags but I thought of him However you have provided him a wife  L Glen  I have you saw her on your arrival I suppose for I left her in town to attend a sick aunt Poor Mortimerhe died one month before the Duke his brother and missed a fine title and estate You know how I loved the honest fellow and cannot wonder I took home his orphan'd daughter as a match for Woodville  Gov  Brother brother you are too generous it is your foible and artful people know how to convert it to their own advantage  L Glen  It is if a foible the noblest incident to humanity Sophia has birth merit accomplishments and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank  Gov  Can she have a worse want on earth Birth merit accomplishments are the very things that render money more essential if she had been brought up in a decent plain way indeedbut she has the airs of a peeress already and if any philosopher doubts of the perpetual motion I would advise him to watch the knocker of your house Then you have out of your precise decorums removed your son to make way for this flirt of fashion and what is the consequence of rendering him thus early his own master  L Glen  If you run on thus only to divert yourself with all my heart but if you would throw a real imputation on Miss Mortimer's conduct she is entitled to my serious defence I never saw any good arise from secluding young people and authorise Woodville and Sophia to live with that innocent elegance which renders ev'ry rank easy and prevents pleasure from seducing the heart or ignorance the senses  Gov  My Lord I am amazed at you was there ever yet a woman who didn't mean to pass for a goddess Do they not gain upon us continually 'till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name We are wise fellows truly if we do not keep down this humour of theirs as long as possible by breeding them in retirement Every tinsel fop will find address enough to convince wife she is an angel and the husband must be lucky as well as sensible who reconciles her to treatment so inferior to her deserts Woodville will agree with me I dare say for the character suits with his intended and 'faith he will  make but a modish husband or he could not endure to see her flying about like the queenbee with the whole hive at her heels  L Glen  You are too captious brother  Gov  And you too placid brother if like me you had been toiling a third of your days to compass a favourite design and found it disappointed at the moment you thought it complete what would even your serene Lordship say and dohere have I promised myself a son in yoursan heir in yoursinstead of which  L Glen  His marriage with Miss Mortimer will not make him unworthy either title  Gov  Never mention her name to me I beg my LordI hate all modemongers of either sex the wife I would have given him has beauty without knowing it innocence without knowing it because she knows nothing else and to surprize you further forty thousand pounds without knowing itnay to bring all your surprizes together is my daughter without knowing it  L Glen  Your daughter why have you married since my sister's death your daughter by  her  you lost before you went abroad  Gov  Yes but I shall find her again I believeI know you will call this one of my odd whims as usual but we all have some witness this dainty project of yours and so I will tell you the truth in spite of that projectfrom the very birth of this girl I saw her mother would spoil her and had she liv'd proposed kidnapping Miss in her infancy  L Glen  Kidnap your own daughterwhy brother I need only prove this to obtain a commission of lunacy and shut you up for life  Gov  Why tho' my wife was your Lordship's sister I will venture to tell you she was plaguy fantastical and contriv'd to torment me as much with her  virtues  as others by their  vices  such a fuss about her  delicacy  her  sensibility  and her  refinement  that I could neither look nor speak without offending one or the other and execrated the inventor of the jargon ev'ry hour in the four and twenty a jargon I resolved my girl should never learn and heav'n no sooner took her mother heaven be praised for all things than I dispatch'd her draggletailed French governess made a bonfire of ev'ry book on education whip'd Miss into a postchaise under a pretence of placing her in a nunnery instead of which I journey'd into Wales and left her under the care of a poor curate's wife whose name was up as the best housewife in the whole country then return'd with a solemn history of her death in the smallpox  L Glen  Well this is indeed astonishing an admirable tutoress truly for my niece  Gov  Yes but there's a better jest than that  L Glen  IndeedIs that possible  Gov  How do you think I contrived to  make  them obey my instructionsI saw they suspected I was some rich humorist and was afraid they would after all make a little bit of a gentlewoman of her for which reason except the first year in advance they never had a single shilling of my money  L Glen  This is almost incredible and so you left your only child to the charity of strangers  Gov  No no not so bad as that neitherYou remember my honest servant Hardy after the poor fellow's leg was shot off in my tent I promis'd him a maintenance so entrusting him with the secret order'd him to live in the neighbourhood have an eye on the girl and claim her if illusedfine accounts I had from him 'faith the old parson and his wife having no children and not finding any one own her gave out she was  theirs  and doated on her in short she is the little wonder of the country tall as the palmtree with cheeks that might shame the drawingroom and eyes will dim the diamonds I have brought over to adorn themThis confounded gout has kept me in continual alarm or else she should have spoke for herself  L Glen  Why then does not Hardy bring her up to you  Gov  Why for two very sufficient reasonsin the first place that identical parson paid him the last compliment that is buried him a twelvemonth ago and in the second they would hardly entrust her to any man but him who deliver'd her to themHere was a girl my Lord to support your title of which I dare swear you are as fond as ever she would have brought you a race of true Britons instead of which from the painted dolls and unjointed Macaronies of these days we shall produce our own enemies and have a race of Frenchmen born in England  L Glen  I thank your  intention  brother but am far from wishing the chief accomplishments of Woodville's Lady should be the making  cream cheeses goats whey  and  alder wine  Gov  Let me tell your Lordship women were never better than when those  were  their chief accomplishmentsBut I may be ridiculous my own way without being singular  Harcourt  shall have my girl and my money tooCream cheeses quotha no no making cream  faces  is an accomplishment which the belles of these days oftener excel in  L Glen  I would not advise you to publish this opinion Governor  Gov  But where is this son of yours sure he has not totally forgot his old uncle  L Glen  He will be here immediately  Gov  Nay I must e'en take an old man's fate and follow his mistress without complaint  L Glen  You have no reason for the reproach this is not his hour for visiting Miss Mortimer  Gov  Miss Mortimerha ha ha why do you think I took  her  for his mistresswhat I warrant I can tell you news of your own family though I have hardly been three days in itWoodville keeps a girl and in great splendornay they tell me that the unconscionable young rogue encroaches so far on the privileges of threescore as to intend marrying the slut  L Glen  You jest surely  Gov  There's no jest like a true oneha ha ha how foolish you lookthis is your  innocent elegance  this is the blessed effect of letting him live out of your own house  L Glen  Pr'ythee reserve your raillery sir for some less interesting occasionto have my views thus in a moment overturnedwhere does she live  Gov  Ha ha haoh the difference of those little syllables  me  and  thee  now you can guess what made me so peevish I supposeas to where Miss lives I have not heard but somewhere near  his  lodgingsA devilish fine girl she is by the byeAh I told you twenty years ago you would spoil this boyentirely spoil him  L Glen  Zounds Governor you have a temper Socrates himself could not have supportedis this a time for old sayings of twenty years agofinish dressingby that time your nephew will be here and I shall have reflected on this matter  Gov  With all my heart'tis but a boyish frolick and so good morning to youHere where's my triumvirate Pompey Anthony Caesar  Exit  L Glen  A boyish frolick trulymany a foolish fellow's life has been marked by such a boyish frolickbut her residence is the first object of my enquiryVane  Enter  Vane  Is not my son come  Vane  This moment my Lord and walks till the Governor is ready  L Glen  VaneI have deserved you should be attached to me and I hope you are  Vane  My Lord what the devil is he at  aside  L Glen  This strange old Governor has alarm'd me a good dealyou are more likely to know whether with reason than I can beHave you heard any thing important of my son lately  Vane  Never my Lord  L Glen  Not that he keeps a mistresswhat does the fool smile at  Vane  I did not think that any thing important my Lord  L Glen  I do sirand am told a  more  important thing that he even thinks of marrying hernow though I cannot credit this I would chuse to know what kind of creature she iscould not you assume a clownish disguise and scraping an acquaintance with her people learn something of her character and designs  Vane  Doubtless to oblige your Lordship  I could  do such a thingBut if Mr Woodville's sharp eyes and love will render them still sharper should discover me I might chance to get a good drubbing in the character of a spy  L Glen  Oh it is very improbable he should suspect youat the worst name your employer and your bones are safeThe office perhaps is not very agreeable but I impose few such on you execute it well and you shall remember it with pleasureI will detain Woodville 'till you are ready and as I doubt not that his next visit will be to this  creature by following him you will find out where she lives Prepare then as quick as possible and send me word when you are ready for 'till then I will not suffer him to depart  Exit  Vane  A pretty errand this his formal Lordship has honor'd me withumif I  betray  him shall I not get more by itay but our heir is such a sentimental spark that when his turn was serv'd he might betray  me  Were he one of your hareum scareum goodnatur'd goodfornothing fellows it would go against my conscience to do him an ill turnI believe I stand well in my Lord's will if Counsellor Puzzle may be trusted and when he can get nothing by a lye perhaps he may tell truth so like all thriving men I will be honest because it best serves my interest  Exit  SCENE  A confin'd Garden  Woodville  walking about  Wood  How tedious is this unclehow tedious every bodywas it not enough to spend two detestable months from my love merely to preserve the secret but I must be tantalized with seeing without arriving at her yet how when I do see her shall I appease that affecting pride of a noble heart conscious too late of its own inestimable valuewhy was I not uniformly justI had then spared myself the bitterest of regrets  Enter Captain  Harcourt  Har  Woodville how do'stdon't you in happy retirement pity me my Ealing and Acton marches and countermarches as Foote has itbut methinks thy face is thinner and longer than a forsaken nymph's who is going through the whole ceremony of a nine month's repentanceWhat thou'st fall'n in loverustically toonay prithee don't look so very lamentable  Wood  Ridiculouskeep this Parkconversation for military puppieshow can we have an eye or ear for pleasure when our fate hangs over us undecided  Har  I guess what you mean but why make mountains of molehills Is the rosyfisted damsel so obstinately virtuous  Wood  Imagine a fair favorite of Phoebus in all respects since while her face caught his beams her heart felt his geniusimagine all the graces hid under a straw hat and russet gown imagine  Har  You have  imagined  enough of conscience and now for a few plain facts if you please  Wood  To such a lovely country maid I lost my heart last summer and soon began to think romances the only true histories all the toilsome glories recorded by Livy phantoms of pleasure compared with the mild enjoyments described by Sir Philip Sydney and happiness not merely possible in a cottage but  only  possible there  Har  Well all the philosophers ancient and modern would never be able to convince me a coach was not a mighty pretty vehicle and the lasses as goodnatur'd in town as country but pray let us know why you laid aside the pastoral project of eating fat bacon and exercising a crook all day that thou might'st conclude the evening with the superlative indulgence of a peatfire and a bed stuft with straw  Wood  Why faith by persuading the dear girl to share mine  Har  Oh now you talk the language of the world and does that occasion thee such a melancholy face  Wood  How ignorant are you both of me and herev'ry moment since I prevail'd has only serv'd to convince me I can sooner live without ev'ry thing else than her and this fatal leisure caus'd by my absence with my father she has employ'd in adding ev'ry grace of art to those of nature till thoroughly shock'd at her situation her letters are as full of grief as love and I dread to hear ev'ry hour I have lost her  Har  I dread much more to hear you have lost yourselfAh my dear Woodville the most dangerous charm of love is ev'ry man conceits no other ever found out his method of loving but take my word for it your Dolly may be brought back to a MilkmaidLeave her to herself awhile and she'll drop the celestials I dare swear  Wood  She is too noble and nothing but the duty I owe to so indulgent a father prevents me from off'ring her all the reparation in my pow'r  Har  A fine scheme truly why Woodville ar't franticTo predestinate yourself among the horned cattle of Doctors Commons and take a wife for the very reason which makes so many spend thousands to get rid of one  Wood  To withdraw an amiable creature from her duty without being able to make her happy is to me a very serious reflectionnay I sinned I may say from  virtue  and had I been a less grateful son might have call'd myself a faultless lover  Har  Well well man you are young enough to trust to time and he does wondersDon't go now and ruin yourself with your uncleI have found him out already and advertise you none of your formal obsequious bows and respectful assents will do with him having been cheated in former times of half his fortune by a parasite he mistrusts ev'ry one and always mistakes politeness for servility Maintain your own opinion if you would win his for he generally grows undetermined the moment he knows those around him are otherwise and above all shake off this mental lethargy  Wood  I will endeavour to take your adviceShould she fly I were undone for everbut you are no judge of my Cecilia's sincerity How should you know those qualities which rise with ev'ry following hourCan you think so meanly of me as that I could be duped by a vulgar wretch a selfish wanton  oh noshe possesses ev'ry virtue but the one I have robbed her of  Exit  Harcourt  alone  Har  Poor Frank thy sponsors surely by intutuition characterized thee when they gave thee that namedid I love your welfare less I could soon ease your heart by acquainting you of my marriage with Miss Mortimer but now the immediate consequence would be this ridiculous matchHow if I apprize either my Lord or the Governor both obstinate in different ways I might betray only to ruin himA thought occursmy person is unknown to herchusing an hour when he is absent I'll pay her a visit offer her an advantageous settlement and learn from her behaviour her real character and intentions  Exit  THE END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II

help us how fantastical some folks not a hundred miles off are If I can imagine what's come to my ladyHere has she been sighing and groaning these two months because her lover was in the country and now truly she's sighing and groaning because he's come to town Such maggots indeed I might as well have staid in our parish all the days of my life as to live mew'd up with her in this dear sweet town

humble happy home to embitter the age of my venerable father and bear the contempt of the world I can never support my ownMy heart revolts against my situation and hourly bids me renounce a splendor which only renders guilt more despicable  Rises  I meant to explain this hereafter but the agitation of my mind obliged me to lighten it immediately  Wood  Is your affection already extinct for sure it must when you can resolve to torture me thus  Cec  Were my love extinct I might sink into a mean contentoh no'Tis to that alone I owe my resolution  Wood  Can you then plunge me into despairso

protection indeed but at what a price  Wood  Give me but a little time my loveI am equally perplexed between my father and my uncle each of whom offers me a wife I can never love Suffer them to defeat each other's schemeslet me if possible be happy without a crime for I must think it one to grieve a parent hitherto so indulgentI will not put any thing in competition with your peace and long for the hour when the errors of the lover will be absorb'd in the merits of the husband  Cec  No Woodville that was when innocent as far above my hopes as it is now beyond my wishesI love you too sincerely to reap any advantage from so generous an error yet you at once flatter and wound my heart in allowing me worthy such a distinction but love cannot subsist without esteem and how should I possess yours when I have lost even my own  Wood  It is impossible you should ever lose either while so deserving bothI shall not be so easily denied hereafter but am bound by the caprices of others at presentI am obliged to return directly but will hasten to you the very first momentwhen we meet again it must be with a smile remember  Cec  It will when we meet againOh how those words oppress me  aside  but do not regulate your conduct by mine nor make me an argument with yourself for disobeying my Lord for here I solemnly swear never to accept you without the jointconsent of both our fathers and that I consider as an eternal abjurationbut may the favor'd woman you are to make happy have all my love without my weakness  Exit in tears  Wood  Disinterested exalted girlwhy add such a needless bar for is

with your request Sir without enquiring the motive because you I think  can  have only oneMy father if I may trust my heart has made you his messenger to an unwilling offender  Har  Pardon me madam but I refer you to this  Cec  Reads  "Madam  "Being certainly inform'd Mr Woodville is on the point of marrying a Lady chosen by his friends when it is presumed you will be disengaged a nobleman of rank and estate above what  he  can ever possess is thus early in laying his heart and fortune at your feet lest some more lucky rival should anticipate himThe bearer is authorised to disclose all particulars and offer you a settlement worthy your acceptanceDeign madam to listen to him on the subject and you will find the unknown lover as generous and not less constant than Woodville"  Cec  Good heaven's to what an insult have I expos'd myself    She bursts into tears and sinks into a chair without minding  Harcourt  who watches her with irresolution    Har  What can I thinkthere is an air of injured delicacy in her which teaches me to reproach myself for a wellmeant deceitIf madam  Cec  I had forgot this wretch  Rises  Return sir to your vile employer tell him whoever he is I am too sensible of the insult tho' not entitled to resent ittell him I have a heart above my situation and that he has only had the barbarous satisfaction of adding another misery to those which almost overwhelmed me before  Har  Hear me madamI conjure you  Cec  Nevera word would contaminate me  Struggling to go off  Har  Nay you shallYou do not know half the good consequences of this letter I am the friend the relation of Woodvillemy name Harcourt  Cec  Is it possible  he  should be so cruel so unjust  Har  He is neither cruel nor unjust but only unfortunateHearhe designs to marry you this I learnt from himself only this morning As a proof of my sincerity I will own I doubted your right to that mark of his esteem and made this trial in consequence Pleas'd to find you worthy of his rank I feel shock'd at reminding you you ought not to share it But madam if you truly love him you cannot wish that to be just to you he should be unjust to those who have a prior right over himThis shall positively be my last effort  Aside  Cec  A motive like your's sir will excuse any thing How little my happiness honour or interest  ever  weighed against his need not be repeated Far be it from me  now  to disgrace him he is apprized of my invincible objections to a match which will never  take place May he form a happier while I by a voluntary poverty expiate my offence  Har  MaMawhat the devil choaks me soI am struck with your sentiments and must find you a proper asylum The moment I saw you I had hopes such manners could not veil an immoral heart I have proved your sincerity and owe a reparation to your delicacy The proposed bride of Woodville is every way worthy that distinction nor am I without hopes even  she  will be prevailed on to protect youBut I must not leave a doubt of my sinceritydo you know Miss Mortimer  Cec  I have seen the lady sir But dare I credit my senseshas heav'n form'd two such hearts and for me  Har  With her your story will be buried for ever and I think the sooner you disappear the more easily will you prevent Woodville's disobedience I will open the affair to Miss Mortimer directly and if she acquiesces desire her to call for you in person to prevent the possibility of any artifice  Cec  He who inspired such sentiments alone can reward them Oh sir you have raised a poor desponding heart but it shall be the business of my future life to deserve those favours I can never half repay  Har  I find by punishing me with acknowledgments you are resolved to be obliged to me The time is too precious to be wasted on such trifles At seven you

travellingchaise and four stout fellows immediately  Vane  To be sure my Lord I can order a chaise at any inn if you chuse it  L Glen  Pho phodon't put on that faceyou must go through with this thing like a manHere's something for the share you have already had in itDo what I have ordered and wait near the Horse Guards in about an hour when I shall seize this insolent baggage and convey her out of my son's reachYou gave me a highflown account of herand as you are a smart young fellow and she must at least be pretty if we can contrive to frighten her into taking  you  as a husband it will end all my fears and shall be the making of your fortune  Vane  Gad I like the project wellA handsome wife is the best bait when we fish for prefermentand this gives me a double claim both on father and son  aside  Nothing but the profound respect I have  for your Lordship could induce me to think of thisthough born without rank and fortune I have a soul my Lord  L Glen  Come come my good lad I guess what you would say but we have no time for speechesI have set my heart on the success of the project and you shall find your interest in indulging me  Exeunt different ways  SCENE  Miss  Mortimer's  Apartment  Enter Captain  Harcourt  meeting Miss  Mortimer  Har  If I were to judge of your temper by your looks my dear I should say it was uncommonly sweet this morning  M Mor  A truce with compliment I must in reason renounce dear flattery after marriage  Har  To flattery you never paid court but the language of the heart and the world will sometimes resembleI ought however to praise your temper for I am come to try itand give you a noble opportunity of exerting its benevolence  M Mor  A benevolence you certainly doubt by this studied eulogium  Har  I might did I not know it wellIn short my love I have taken the strangest step this morning  M Mor  What step for heav'n's sake  Har  In regard to a lady  M Mor  Not another wife I hope  Har  Noonly a mistress  M Mor  Oh a trifle a trifle  Har  You may laugh madam but I am serious and a fine girl she is and to shew you I have not read Chesterfield in vain I have robb'd my dearest friend of her in plain English Woodville has a mistress he doats on so madly as even to intend marrying herImagining her like most of her stamp only an artful and interested creature I paid her a visit as a stranger with an offer which must have unveil'd her heart had it been basebut I found her on the contrary a truly nobleminded girl and far above her present situation which she earnestly wishes to quitIn short my dear I thought it prudent to part them and in your name offered her an asylum  M Mor  In my name You amaze me Mr Harcourt Would you associate your wife with a kept mistress bring such an acquisition into the house of Lord Glenmore and deprive Woodville of perhaps his only reason for not interfering with usDo you think I credit this  sudden  acquaintance  Har  I deceiv'd myself I findI thought you above such low suspicion that you could make distinctions  M Mor  Yes yes I can make distinctions more clearly than you wished You must excuse my interference in this affair sir and let me hint to you that your own will do as little credit to your heart as to your understanding  Har  Mighty well madam go on I Settle this with respect to yourself but do not be concerned about me for in one word if you cannot resolve on protecting this poor unfortunate I will  M Mor  Aside  That must not be yet his warmth alarms meNay but my dear think deliberatelySupposing her all you say the world judges by actions not thoughts and will bury her merit in her situation  Har  It is that cruel argument perpetuates error in so many of your frail sex be the first to rise above it That you are in Lord Glenmore's house will be your justification both to the world and himself for what but the design of serving him and his son can actuate you In my eyes my dear Sophia virtue never looks so lovely as when she stretches out her hand to the fallen  M Mor  Oh Harcourt I am ashamed of my suspicion I ought to have known all the candour and generosity of your heart and received in a moment the unhappy woman it patronizedyet at this crisis in our own affairs to run the chance of further exasperating my benefactor  Har  I am not to learn that friendship and love have been mere masks to fraud and folly in the great world no one would blame me were I to suffer Woodville to ruin himself as the shortest way of fixing my own fortune and obtaining my Lord's approbation of your choice But I know not how it happened that when a mere boy I took it into my head truth was as much to the purpose as lying and as I never got into more scrapes than others why I still pursue my system and prefer honour to art Then if we fail we have something better to console us than a pond or a pistol and if we succeed what is there wanting to our happiness  M Mor  And how do you mean to manage her escape  Har  That my dearest is the difficulty I found she had seen you and therefore was obliged to satisfy her of my honour by assuring her you would call for her in person  M Mor  Very well we must carefully watch our opportunity You dine herethe  word  of command you are accustomed to obey but you must now become obedient to the  look  for you know I have my difficulties however strong my desire of obliging you

leave off  Har  IT grows near the appointed hour my lovebut how to make sure of Woodville  M Mor  You should have thought of that before my sagacious confidante However as  I  do not need your company fasten it upon himpretend a duelpretend an intriguein short if all else fails pretend you are dying and keep him to make your will rather than suffer him to interrupt me  L Glen  to himself  What way can I secure the absence of this son of mine for I see plainly another lucky hit would almost provoke him into throwing the dice in the Governor's face yet Vane I doubt has hardly been able to procure me ev'ry convenience in so short a time However I will make one of my own garrets his minx's prison rather than suffer her to interfere with my serious views  Gov  Rising from play  Zounds Frank you are like the French so ready to be beat that there is hardly any triumph in conquering you But you shall take your revenge I insist upon it  Wood  Another time sirmy head achsmyin short I cannot play

going to escape They all take pleasure in perplexing me Frank return to me directly  I have bethought myself of something very important in which I need your assistance  Wood  Would I had bethought myself of vanishing like Harcourt How devilishly vexatious  Leads Miss  Mortimer  off  Gov  So there goes madam to coquette curtsy and talk nonsense with every welldressed ape of either sex Before I would allow a girl such a freedom  L Glen  Brother do not judge 'till you know her and give me leave to tell you these prejudices of your temper will render you very ridiculous  Gov  The prejudices of my temper Oh Lord Oh Lord this is an excellent jest Zounds because you have not the use of your eyes  L Glen  I shall never have patience My head is just now full of something too important to examine which of us is most in the wrong I am fixed on removing this ambitious minx of my son's for ever out his reach immediately Will you oblige me with the company of your servants Being slaves they will not dare reveal the affair and were they so inclined can hardly comprehend it  Gov  Will I ay that I will and with my own company into the bargain  L Glen  Hist he returns and if we may judge by his countenance mortified enough to lose the evening away from her  Reenter  Woodville  Go my dear Frank first to Puzzle's chambers for  the mortgage of Hayfield house and don't fail to learn his whole opinion upon the subject    aside to the  Governor  and that will take two long hours by a very moderate computationthen proceed to the London Tavern and ask if Levi the Jew waits there by my appointment otherwise do  you  wait there 'till either he or I join you  Wood  A pretty roundabout employment my father has invented for me  aside  and I dare not give the least symptoms of disgust

Damn his colour tell me his business  Brid  So he axed for my Lady and would not tell  me  what he wanted I came with her however but she no sooner set eyes on him than she sent me out which argufy'd no good you'll say and before I could possibly come back though I ran as fast as ever my legs could carry me he was gone and she writing and crying for dear lifebut that was no news so I did not mind

I yet would recover hergive her back then to a father you first taught her to fear and an habitation too humble for any but the good to be happy in  Wood  Alas Sir can you trifle with my misery do

fidgets to stay long away from our house and in the mean while I can entertain myself extremely well  Sits down to the toilette  Jac  Without  I tell ye my leady's not at huome  Gov  I tell  you  I won't take your word for itso come my Lord and see  Brid  Heyday my Lordwhat's the news now I wonder  Enter Lord  Glenmore  and the  Governor  both stop short  Gov  Oh I thought madam had learnt enough of the ton to lye by proxy  Brid  Dear heartI am all of a twitterationwho can these bethat's my Lord for certain  L Glen  The vulgarity of the wench is astonishing  Gov  Umwhy a little gawky or sothere's no denying it  aside  Here's a pretty discovery now after all my projectsthank fortune the secret is yet my own though  L Glen  Advancing to her  I ought to beg your excuse madam for so abrupt an intrusion but the opportunity and so fair a temptation will I flatter myself be a sufficient apology  Brid  aside  He takes me for my lady that's a sure thingoh this is charmingyou need not make no 'poligy's my Lordinferials never knows how to suspect people of quality but I understands good breeding better  L Glen  aside  Why what a Barndoor Mawkin it is your politeness madam can only

Brid  He has not been here this morning but if he had he knows better than to ax ater my company I do assure you myLordship  L Glen  I have been told he intends marrying you what a pity to monopolize such merit  Brid  If he has any such kind intention 'tis more than I knows of I assure you  L Glen  His keeping that wise resolution from you is some little comfort however  Brid  But I promise ye I shall make a rare person of qualityfor I loves cards coaches dancing and dress to my very heartnothing in the world betterbut Blindman's Buff I had some thoughts of taking a trip to Sadler's Wells or Fox Hall but they don't begin till five o'clock  Gov  Aside  Ha ha tho' she can hardly spell out the Ten Commandments she cou'd break every one with as much ease and impudence as if she had been bred in the circle of St James's  L Glen  But Madam you know allowing Woodville willing to marry you it is not in his power while his father lives without forfeiting his fortune the value of which you doubtless understand  Brid  Oh yes yes for sartain my Lord  L Glen  Who knows too how far an incensed parent may carry his resentmenthe might find means to entrap and punish you  Brid  Ha ha hahe entrap methat  would  be a good jestno no I have more of the lady of quality than to be so easily caught  Gov  mimicking her  He he he that is the only particular in which you have nothing at all of

Lord  L Glen  Convince me that you don't love this Woodville and I know not how far my passion may carry me  Brid  Love him do you think I know no more of high life than that comes toTo be sure he is a sweet pretty man and all thatbut as to loveI loves nobody half so well as myself  L Glen  Upon my soul I believe you and wish he had the whole benefit of the declaration  to the Governor  her ingratitude is as shocking as her ignorance and Bridewell too gentle a punishment  Gov  Then build a bridewell large enough to contain the whole sex for the only diff'rence between her and the rest isthis Country Mawkin  tells  what the Townbred Misses  conceal  L Glen  Why Governor you are as testy as if you had had the care of  her  education  Gov  I the carezounds what I say is merely from friendship to your LordshipI hate to see you deceive yourself  Aside  Surely he can never suspect  Bridget  is employ'd in cramming trinkets from the dressingtable into her pockets    Brid  Now I am ready to go my Lord  L Glen  Reflect Madamit would hurt me to have you say I deceiv'd youif you should repentI am much afraid you will  Brid  What wh  n I am a Ladyoh I'll venture that and attend you

be no LadyI be only Bridget  Gov  I would give ten thousand pounds that you  were  only Bridget you artful pussZounds tho' I could one moment strangle the pug's face in her own necklace yet the next I can hardly prevail on myself to punish herwhat the devil had I  now  to do in England or what the devil had I  ever  to do in WalesPhew I could dethrone fifty Nabobs without half the fatigue and anxiety of this momentTake her away however and let us try how Miss likes riding out in her  own coach  Vane  and the Slaves seize her she screams out and catches Lord  Glenmore'  s coat falling on

down to embroidery  How fond how weak how ungrateful are out heartsmine still will presumptuously fancy this house its home and ally itself to ev'ry one to whom Woodville is dear  Lord Glenmore  enters  Cec  Oh heaven's my Lordhow unluckyif I go he may find the Captain with Miss Mortimer  L Glen  You see madam you have only to retire to engage us to pursue you even to rudenessBut tell me can it be your own choice to punish us so far as to prefer solitude to our society  Cec  I know myself too well my Lord to receive distinctions of which I am unworthyyet think not therefore I fail in respect  L Glen  But is that charming bosom susceptible of nothing beyond respect why is it capable of inspiring a passion it cannot participate  Cec  Your goodness my Lordmy profound veneration will always attend youbut the more generously you are inclined to forget what is due to yourself the more strongly it is impressed on my memory  L Glen  Were what you say true the bounties of nature atone amply to you for the parsimony of fortune nor would your want of every other advantage lessen your merit or my sense of it  Cec  aside  Had he thought thus a few months since how happy had I now beenYour approbation at once flatters and serves me by justifying Miss Mortimer's protection of me  L Glen  Her partiality for you does her more honour than it can ever do you advantage But you must tell me how she gain'd first the happiness of knowing you  Cec  Mymy Lord by a misfortune so touching  L Glen  Nay I would not distress you neither yet I own madam I wish to make a proposal worth a serious answer but ought first to know why you affect a mystery Tell me then my dear ev'ry incident of your life and I will raise you to a title I may without vanity say many have aspired to  Cec  You oppress my very soul my Lord But alas unconquerable obstacles deprive me for ever of that title Neither  would  I obtain it by alienating such a son from such a father  L Glen  Put him entirely out of the question the meanness of his conduct acquits me to myself Do you know madam he has resolved to marry a creature of low birth illiterate vulgar and impudent and to complete her perfections she has been  his  mistress at least  Cec  Surely he knows and purposely shocks me thus  Aside  L Glen  But your integrity doesn't render you less amiable in my eyes it greatly enhances ev'ry other merit As to his wretch I have her in my power and shall make her dearly repent  Cec  Then I am lost indeed  aside  You have my Lord tho' I know not how discovered  Rises in confusion  L Glen  rises taking snuff without looking at her  Oh nothing more easy madam I had him carefully traced to her house and during his absence took servants and forced her away  Cec  aside  That however cannot be me every word seems to add to a mystery I dare not enquire into  L Glen  But why waste one precious moment on such an animal what are these unconquerable obstacles  Cec  Spare me my Lord your indulgence induces me to try again to soften your resolutions respecting your son deprived of the weak the guilty the miserable wretch you justly condemn a little time will no doubt incline him to his duty I should have your pardon to solicit my Lord but that your own openness authorizes mine  L Glen  But can you who so powerfully plead the cause of another be deaf to the sighs of a man who adores you who offers you a rank  Cec  Be satisfied my Lord with knowing I have all that esteem your merit claims which influences  me  beyond every casual advantage  L Glen  But madam  Cec  Alas my Lord  bursts into tears aside  Be silent if possible both pride and virtue I have deserved and will submit to ityet surely the bitterness of this moment expiates all past offences  Exit  L Glen  Amiable creature what an amazing elegance of mind and person Tears were her only answers to my questions and blushes to my looks yet these only heighten a curiosity they have softened into love  Exit  Woodville's

How do you know that peppercornhow do you know thatod I could tell you  Wood  And to tell you my full mind Sir I had rather make myself a wretch to gratify my father than any other man  Gov  Od thou art so obstinate boy there's no disliking thee  Aside  I don't see why I am obliged  to know his Miss is my daughterI have a great mind to own what we have done with her and if he will marry e'en take care nobody hinders him then trump up a farce about forgiving themand yet it goes against my conscience to punish the puppy for life though he has punished me pretty sufficiently by the Lord Harry

Charles as the moment approaches nearer your influence becomes insensibly less powerfulthe frantic fits of the Governor the solemn absurdity of my Lordbut above all the behaviour of Woodville hurts and alarms mestill cautious not to offend his father he has tried ev'ry way to extort the refusal from me but by a pardonable equivocation I left him hopeless and assured him I should to the utmost of my power obey my benefactorWhy why did you marry one who could give you nothing but her heart  Har  I shall not answer till you can name me an equivalenttrust to my management my dear SophiaI still flatter myself one storm will settle the tenor of our livesif not while acquitted to Heav'n the world and ourselves we may struggle with spirit against fortune and sometimes owe our dearest enjoyments to her fluctuations  M Mor  By sentiments like these you won my very soul and to retain for ever a heart so invaluable I have ventur'd the displeasure of my benefactor but our hearts will not always follow the lead of our reason nor when I consider the cause can I repent the deviation of mine  Har  Think if you pity yourself what you can give to Cecilia and fortify her mind against too strong a sense of her frailty For my part I must watch whatever is going on  M Mor  So you leave me out of the plotwell if it ends happily I shall be contented and like the world measuring your merit by your success will declare you a most inimitable schemerAdieu  Har  Nay stay a moment  M Mor  Not for the world for here comes your uncle with a face more petrifying than Medusa's  Exit  Enter the  Governor

beauty  Gov  What poor malicious wretches are we by natureZounds if I could not find in my heart to  rejoice at thinking every one here will be as mortified and disappointed as a certain person that shall be namelessSo so here they come faith to argue the point in open court  Enter Lord  Glenmore  followed by  Woodville  L Glen  Without this proof of your obedience all you can urge Sir is ineffectual  Wood  While obedience was possible I never swerv'd my Lord but when you command me to make myself wretched a superior duty cancels thatalready bound by a voluntary an everlasting vow I cannot break it without offending heav'n nor keep it without offending you  Gov  aside  What's this chop'd about again  Wood  Did you once know the incomparable merits of my love even your Lordship's prejudices must give way to your reason  L Glen  Mere dotageBut had she more than any one woman ever yet possess'd doesn't her conduct equally evince her folly and depravity  Wood  Cover'd as I ought to be with confusion and remorse I will own she was seduc'd and deceiv'd  Gov  aside  Ah poor boy  one  of the two was woefully deceiv'd sure enough  L Glen  Oh your conscience may be very easy on that account it could not require much art to deceive such an ideot  Gov  No no my Lord why paint the devil blacker than he is not an ideot neither  Wood  Sir my father's freedom of speech I must endurebut yours  Gov  You must endure too young Sir or I shall bite my tongue off  Wood  But my Lord that dear unhappy girl is no longer a subject of debateshe evidently proves her merit by her flight  L Glen  Would you make a virtue from not doing ill when it is no longer in your powerWoodville I was once weak enough to believe indulgence the surest way of obtaining your duty and esteemMy eyes are at last openedMiss Mortimer is worthy a better husband but you are her's or no son of mineI solemnly promised this to her dying father and will acquit myself at all events  Wood  Can you resolve to sacrifice me to a promise made before we could judge of each otherYou never felt Sir the compulsion you practicewill you dissolve the first band of morality and see your highlyestimated title end in me for never will I on these terms continue it  L Glen  I almost wish  I  never had continued it  Walks in anger  I am determined Woodville and nothing but Miss Mortimer's refusal can break the match  Wood  I shall not put that in her power my Lord Permit me to tell you no son was ever more sensible of a father's kindness but if I can purchase its continuance only with my honour and my happiness it would be too dearly bought  L Glen  'Tis well sirI have listened to you sufficiently Now hear ME Know this worthless wretch you prefer to your duty is in my power nay in this house  Har  aside  The devil she is how in the name of illluck should he find that outmy fine scheme entirely blown up by Jupiter  Wood  Why play thus upon me my Lordher letter  L Glen  What has she wrote to youthat I was

your family that I see and this fellow too to teize me whom I lov'd above all in it Why I spoke entirely from regard to him If since then I have discovered  a bumpkin was beforehand with him in the possession of his miss  Wood  If any one beside yourself sir durst tell such a falshood it would cost a life  Gov  Yes and if any one beside myself durst tell me such a truth it would cost a soul perhaps  Exit  Har  This is more unintelligible than all the rest  L Glen  To end these altercationsupon yourself Woodville shall depend the fortune of this wretch to whom you have been so gross a dupe as to justify the imputation of folly Why even without knowing me she ridiculed your passion and offered to leave you  Wood  Impossible  L Glen  Dare you disbelieve me sirnay she shall be produced and obliged to confess her artsthen blush and obey Here Vane Governor the keys  Exit  Woodville  walks behind in great agitation  Har  Now could I find in my heart to make this story into a ballad as a warning to all meddling puppies and then hang myself that it may conclude with a grace Zounds he must be endued with supernatural intelligence Just when I was saying a thousand civil things to myself on my success to have my mine sprung before my eyes by the enemy and instead of serving my friend and myself become a meer tool to old Gravity's revenge 'Pshaw however we must make the best of a bad matterWoodville what do'st mean to do man  Wood  Let them produce my Ceciliathen seize and protect her to the last moment of my life  Har  And I will assist you to the last moment of

farce is this  Har  Heyday more incomprehensibilities  Van  Aside  Now for the eclaircissementsince if the Governor doesn't acknowledge her in his first rage and confusion I may never be able to make himI humbly hope Mr Woodville will pardon me if with her own consent and my Lord's  I  this morning married this young lady  Gov  Zounds you dog what's that  you  married herwhy how did you dareand

content to be ev'ry way his victim so I am not his ruin  L Glen  But to find you in this house  Cec  Your generous nephew and the amiable Miss Mortimer distinguish'd me with the only asylum could shelter me from your son  L Glen  They distinguished  themselves  Oh Woodville did I think an hour ago I could be more angry with youHow durst you warp a mind so noble  Wood  It is a crime my life cannot expiateyet if the sincerest anguish  L Glen  I have one act of justice still in my powermy prejudice in favour of birth and even a stronger prejudice is corrected by this lovely girlof her goodness of heart and greatness of mind I have had incontestible proofs and if I thought you Frank  Cec  Yet stay my Lord nor kill me with too much kindnessOnce your generosity might have made me happy now only miserableMy reason my pride nay even my love induces me to refuse as the only way to prove I deserve himhe has taught me to know the world too late nor will I retort on him the contempt I have incurr'dMr Woodville will tell you whether I have not solemnly vow'd  Wood  Not to accept me without the consent of both fathers and if mine consents what doubt  Governor  without  Stop that

Rejection and contempt stand out of the waylet me embrace my daughterlet me take her once more to my heart  runs and embraces her  L Glen  His daughter  Gov  Yes my friends this is  really  my daughtermy own Cecilia as sure as I am an old fool after being a young one this good girl has a right to call me so by the name of fatherHasn't she Greywhy my Lord this is the very parson I told you of  taking  Cecilia's  arm under his  and  now  young Sir what do you say to your uncle's freaks  Wood  Say Sir that had you ten thousand such I would go through a patriarchal servitude in hopes of Cecilia's hand for my reward  Gov  And had I ten millions of money and this only girl thou should'st have her and that too for thy noble freedomAnd what says my Cecilia to her father's first gift  Cec  Astonishment and pleasure leave me hardly power to say that a disobedience to you sir would only double my fault nor to worship that Heav'n which has led me through such a trial to such a rewardtake all I have left myself to give you Woodville in my hand  Woodville  kisses first her hand and then herself    Grey  Now let me die my darling child since I have seen thee once more innocent and happy

take that cursed vixen below whoever she is for my partner  L Glen  Methinks all seem rewarded but my poor Sophia here and her protection of Cecilia deserves the highest recompence but whenever my dear you can present me the husband of your choice I will present him with a fortune fit for my daughter  Gov  Protect Cecilia od she is a good girl and a charming girl and I honour the very tip of her feathers nowif she could but fancy our Charles  I'd throw in something pretty on his side I promise you  Miss Mor  Frankness is the fashionWhat would you say Sir and you my Lord if I  had  fancied your Charles so much as to make him mine already  Gov  Hey day more discov'ries how's this boy  Har  Even so Sir indeed  L Glen  It completes my satisfaction  Gov  Od brother who'd have thought you in the right all the whilewe'll never separate again by the Lord Harry but knock down our Welch friend's old house and raise him one on the ruins large enough to contain the whole family of us where he shall reign sole sov'reign over all our future little Woodvilles and Cecilias  Cec  Oppressed with wonder pleasure gratitude I must endeavour to forgive  myself  when heav'n thus graciously proves its forgiveness in allying me to ev'ry human being my heart distinguishes  Grey  Yes my Cecilia you may believe  him  who never gave you a bad lesson that you are now most truly entitled to esteem since
