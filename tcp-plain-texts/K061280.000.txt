 THE LIFE AND STRANGE SURPRIZING ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE Of  YORK  MARINER Who lived Eight and Twenty Years all alone in an uninhabited Island on the Coast of AMERICA near the Mouth of the Great River of OROONOQUE Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck wherein all the Men perished but himself  WITH An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by PYRATES  Written by Himself  LONDON Printed for W TAYLOR at the  Ship  in  PaterNosterRow  MDCCXIX  THE PREFACE  IF ever the Story of any private Man's Adventures in the World were worth making Pvblick and were acceptable when Publish'd the Editor of this Acccount thinks this will be so  The Wonders of this Man's Life exceed all that he thinks is to be found extant the Life of one Man being scarce capable of a greater Variety  The Story is told with Modesty with Seriousness and with a religious Application of Events to the Uses to which wise Men  always apyly them  viz  to the Instruction of others by this Example and to justify and honour the Wisdom of Providence in all the Variety of our Circumstances let them happen how they will  The Editor believes the thing to be a just History of Fact neither is there any Appearance of Fiction in it And however thinks because all such things are dispatch'd that the Improvement of it as well to the Diversion as to the Instruction of the Reader will be the same and as such he thinks without farther Compliment to the World he does them a great Service in the Publication  THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE  c  _I Was born in the Year in the City of  York  of a good Family tho' not of that Country my Father being a Foreigner of  Bremen  who settled first at  Hull  He got a good Estate by Merchandise and leaving off his Trade lived afterward at  York  from whence he had married my Mother whose Relations were named  Robinson  a very good Family in that Country and from whom I was called  Robinson Kreutznaer  but by the usual Corruption of Words in  England  we are now called nay we call our selves and write our Name  Crusoe  and so my Companions always call'd me  I had two elder Brothers one of which was Lieutenant Collonel to an  English  Regiment of Foot in  Flanders  formerly commanded by the famous Coll  Lockhart  and was killed at the Battle near  Dunkirk  inagast the  Spaniards  What became of my second Brother I never knew any more than my Father or Mother did know what was become of me  Being the third Son of the Family and not bred to any Trade my Head began to be fill'd very early with rambling Thoughts My Father who was very ancient had given me a competent Share of Learning as far as HouseEducation and a Country FreeSchool generally goes and design'd me for the Law but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to Sea and my Inclination to this led me so strongly against the Will nay the Commands of my Father and against all the Entreaties and Perswasions of my Mother and other Friends that there seem'd to be something fatal in that Propension of Nature tending directly to the Life of Misery which was to befal me  My Father a wise and grave Man gave me serious and excellent Counsel against what he foresaw was my Design He call'd me one Morning into his Chamber where he was confined by the Gout and expostulated very warmly with me upon this Subject He ask'd me what Reasons more than a meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving my Father's House and my native Country where I might be well introduced and had a Prospect of raising my Fortunes by Application and Industry with a Life of Ease and Pleasure He told me it was for Men of desperate Fortunes on one Hand or of aspiring superior Fortunes on the other who went abroad upon Adventures to rise by Enterprize and make themselves famous in Undertakings of a Nature out of the common Road  that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me that mine was the middle State or what might be called the upper Station of  Low Life  which he had found by long Experience was the best State in the World the most suited to human Happiness not exposed to the Miseries and Hardships the Labour and Sufferings of the mechanick Part of Mankind and not embarass'd with the Pride Luxury Ambition and Envy of the upper Part of Mankind He told me I might judge of the Happiness of this State by this one thing  viz  That this was the State of Life which all other People envied that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being born to great things and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of the two Exremes between the Mean and the Great that the wise Man gave his Testimony to this as the just Standard of true Felicity when he prayed to have neither Poverty or Riches  He bid me observe it and I should always find that the Calamities of Life were shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind but that the middle Station had the fewest Disasters and was not expos'd to so many Vicissitudes as the higher or lower Part of Mankind nay they were not subjected to so many Distempers and Uneasinesses either of Body or Mind as those were who by vicious Living Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand or by hard Labour Want of Necessaries and mean or insufficient Diet on the other Hand bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural Consequences of their Way of Living  That  the middle Station of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues and all kinds of Enjoyments that Peace and Plenty were the Handmaids of a middle Fortune that Temperance Moderation Quietness Health  Society all agreeable Diversions and all desirable Pleasures were the Blessings attending the middle Station of Life that this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World and comfortably out of it not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or of the Head not sold to the Life of Slavery for daily Bread or harrast with perplex'd Circumstances which rob the Soul of Peace and the Body of Rest not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy or secret burning Lust of Ambition for great things but in easy Circumstances sliding gently thro' the World and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living without the bitter feeling that they are happy and learning by every Day's Experience to know it more sensibly  After this he press'd me earnestly and in the most affectionate manner not to play the young Man not to precipitate my self into Miseries which Nature and the Station of Life I was born in seem'd to have provided against that I was under no Necessity of seeking my Bread that he would do well for me and endeavour to enter me fairly into the Station of Life which he had been just recommending to me and that if I was not very easy and happy in the World it must be my meer Fate or Fault that must hinder it and that he should have nothing to answer for having thus discharg'd his Duty in warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt In a word that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at Home as he directed so he would not have so much Hand in my Misfortunes as to give me any Encouragement to go away And to close all he told me I had my elder Brother for an Example to whom he had used the same earnest Perswasions to keep him from going into the Low Country Wars but could not prevail  his young Desires prompting him to run into the Army where he was kill'd and tho' he said he would not cease to pray for me yet he would venture to say to me that if I did take this foolish Step God would not bless me and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my Recovery  I observed in this last Part of his Discourse which was truly Prophetick tho' I suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself I say I observed the Tears run down his Face very plentifully and especially when he spoke of my Brother who was kill'd and that when he spoke of my having Leisure to repent and none to assist me he was so mov'd that he broke off the Discourse and told me his Heart was so full he could say no more to me  I was sincerely affected with this Discourse as indeed who could be otherwise and I resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more but to settle at home according to my Father's Desire But alas a few Days wore it all off and in short to prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities in a few Weeks after I resolv'd to run quite away from him However I did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of Resolution prompted but I took my Mother at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary and told her that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the World that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution enough to go through with it and my Father had better give me his Consent than force me to go without it that I was now Eighteen Years old which was too late to go Apprentice to a Trade or Clerk to an Attorney that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time and I  should certainly run away from my Master before my Time was out and go to Sea and if she would speak to my Father to let me go but one Voyage abroad if I came home again and did not like it I would go no more and I would promise by a double Diligence to recover that Time I had lost  This put my Mother into a great Passion She told me she knew it would be to no Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject that he knew too well what was my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much for my Hurt and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a Discourse as I had had with my Father and such kind and tender Expressions as she knew my Father had us'd to me and that in short if I would ruine my self there was no Help for me but I might depend I should never have their Consent to it That for her Part she would not have so much Hand in my Destruction and I should never have it to say that my Mother was willing when my Father was not  Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father yet as I have heard afterwards she reported all the Discourse to him and that my Father after shewing a great Concern at it said to her with a Sigh That Boy might be happy if he would stay at home but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born I can give no Consent to it  It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose tho' in the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling to Business and frequently expostulating with my Father and Mother about their being so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to But being one Day at  Hull  where I went casually and without any Purpose of making an Elopement that time but I say being there and  one of my Companions being going by Sea to  London  in his Father's Ship and prompting me to go with them with the common Allurement of Seafaring Men  viz  That it should cost me nothing for my Passage I consulted neither Father or Mother any more nor so much as sent them Word of it but leaving them to hear of it as they might without asking God's Blessing or my Father's without any Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences and in an ill Hour God knows On the first of  September  I went on Board a Ship bound for  London  never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes I believe began sooner or continued longer than mine The Ship was no sooner gotten out of the  Humber  but the Wind began to blow and the Winds to rise in a most frightful manner and as I had never been at Sea before I was most inexpressibly sick in Body and terrify'd in my Mind I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done and how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my Father's House and abandoning my Duty all the good Counsel of my Parents my Father's Tears and my Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind and my Conscience which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness which it has been since reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice and the Breach of my Duty to God and my Father  All this while the Storm encreas'd and the Sea which I had never been upon before went very high tho' nothing like what I have seen many times since no nor like what I saw a few Days after But it was enough to affect me then who was but a young Sailor and had never known any thing of the matter I expected every Wave would have swallowed us up and that every time the Ship fell down as I thought in the Trough or Hollow  of the Sea we should never rise more and in this Agony of Mind I made many Vows and Resolutions that if it would please God here to spare my Life this one Voyage if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land again I would go directly home to my Father and never set it into a Ship again while I liv'd that I would take his Advice and never run my self into such Miseries as these any more Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about the middle Station of Life how easy how comfortably he had liv'd all his Days and never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea or Troubles on Shore and I resolv'd that I would like a true repenting Prodigal go home to my Father  These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the while the Storm continued and indeed some time after but the next Day the Wind was abated and the Sea calmer and I began to be a little inur'd to it However I was very grave for all that Day being also a little Sea sick still but towards Night the Weather clear'd up the Wind was quite over and a charming fine Evening follow'd the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next Morning and having little or no Wind and a smooth Sea the Sun shining upon it the Sight was as I thought the most delightful that ever I saw  I had slept well in the Night and was now no more Sea sick but very chearful looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough and terrible the Day before and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time after And now least my good Resolutions should continue my Companion who had indeed entic'd me away comes to me  Well  Bob says he clapping me on the Shoulder  How do you do after it I warrant you were frighted wa'n't you last Night when it blew but a Cap full of  Wind A Cap full d'you call it  said I  'twas a terrible Storm A Storm you Fool you  replies he  do you call that a Storm why it was nothing at all give us but a good Ship and Sea Room and we think nothing of such a Squal of Wind as that but you're but a fresh Water Sailor  Bob  come let us make a Bowl of Punch and we'll forget all that d'ye see what charming Weather 'tis now  To make short this sad Part of my Story we went the old way of all Sailors the Punch was made and I was made drunk with it and in that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance all my Reflections upon my past Conduct and all my Resolutions for my future In a word as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of Surface and settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm so the Hurry of my Thoughts being over my Fears and Apprehensions of being swallow'd up by the Sea being forgotten and the Current of my former Desires return'd I entirely forgot the Vows and Promises that I made in my Distress I found indeed some Intervals of Reflection and the serious Thoughts did as it were endeavour to return again sometimes but I shook them off and rouz'd my self from them as it were from a Distemper and applying my self to Drink and Company soon master'd the Return of those Fits for so I call'd them and I had in five or six Days got as compleat a Victory over Conscience as any young Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with it could desire But I was to have anothet Trial for it still and Providence as in such Cases generally it does resolv'd to leave me entirely without Excuse For if I would not take this for a Deliverance the next was to be such a one as the worst and most Wretch among us would confess both the harden'd Danger and the Mercy  The sixth Day of our being at Sea we came into  Yarmouth  Roads the Wind having been contrary and the Weather calm we had made but little Way since the Storm Here we were obliged to come to an Anchor and here we lay the Wind continuing contrary  viz  at Southwest for seven or eight Days during which time a great many Ships from  Newcastle  came into the same Roads as the common Harbour where the Ships might wait for a Wind for the River  We had not however rid here so long but should have Tided it up the River but that the Wind blew too fresh and after we had lain four or five Days blew very hard However the Roads being reckoned as good as a Harbour the Anchorage good and our GroundTackle very strong our Men were unconcerned and not in the least apprehensive of Danger but spent the Time in Rest and Mirth after the manner of the Sea but the eighth Day in the Morning the Wind increased and we had all Hands at Work to strike our TopMasts and make every thing snug and close that the Ship might ride as easy as possible By Noon the Sea went very high indeed and our Ship rid  Forecastle in  shipp'd several Seas and we thought once or twice our Anchor had come home upon which our Master order'd out the Sheet Anchor so that we rode with two Anchors aHead and the Cables vered out to the better End  By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed and now I began to see Terror and Amazement in the Faces even of the Seamen themselves The Master tho' vigilant to the Business of preserving the Ship yet as he went in and out of his Cabbin by me I could hear him softly to himself say several times  Lord be merciful to us we shall be all lost we shall be all undone  and the like During these first  Hurries I was stupid lying still in my Cabbin which was in the Steerage and cannot describe my Temper I could ill reassume the first Penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon and harden'd my self against I thought the Bitterness of Death had been past and that this would be nothing too like the first But when the Master himself came by me as I said just now and said we should be all lost I was dreadfully frighted I got up out of my Cabbin and look'd out but such a dismal Sight I never saw The Sea went Mountains high and broke upon us every three or four Minutes When I could look about I could see nothing but Distress round us Two Ships that rid near us we found had cut their Masts by the Board being deep loaden and our Men cry'd out that a Ship which rid about a Mile aHead of us was foundered Two more Ships being driven from their Anchors were run out of the Roads to Sea at all Adventures and that with not a Mast standing The light Ships fared the best as not so much labouring in the Sea but two or three of them drove and came close by us running away with only their Spritsail out before the Wind  Towards Evening the Mate and BoatSwain begg'd the Master of our Ship to let them cut away the Foremast which he was very unwilling to But the BoatSwain protesting to him that if he did not the Ship would founder he consented and when they had cut away the Foremast the MainMast stood so loose and shook the Ship so much they were obliged to cut her away also and make a clear Deck  Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all this who was but a young Sailor and who had been in such a Fright before at but a little But if I can express at this Distance the  Thoughts I had about me at that time I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind upon Account of my former Convictions and the having returned from them to the Resolutions I had wickedly taken at first than I was at Death it self and these added to the Terror of the Storm put me into such a Condition that I can by no Words describe it But the worst was not come yet the Storm continued with such Fury that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse We had a good Ship but she was deep loaden and wallowed in the Sea that the Seamen every now and then cried out she would founder It was my Advantage in one respect that I did not know what they meant by Founder till I enquir'd However the Storm was so violent that I saw what is not often seen the Master the BoatSwain and some others more sensible than the rest at their Prayers and expecting every Moment when the Ship would go to the Bottom In the Middle of the Night and under all the rest of of our Distresses one of the Men that had been down on Purpose to see cried out we had sprung a Leak another said there was four Foot Water in the Hold Then all Hands were called to the Pump At that very Word my Heart as I thought died within me and I fell backwards upon the Side of my Bed where I sat into the Cabbin However the Men roused me and told me that I that was able to do nothing before was as well able to pump as another at which I stirr'd up and went to the Pump and work'd very heartily While this was doing the Master seeing some light Colliers who not able to ride out the Storm were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea and would come near us ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress I who knew nothing what that meant was so surprised that I thought the Ship had broke or some  dreadful thing had happen'd In a word I was so surprised that I fell down in a Swoon As this was a time when every Body had his own Life to think of no Body minded me or what was become of me but another Man stept up to the Pump and thrusting me aside with his Foot let me lye thinking I had been dead and it was a great while before I came to my self  We work'd on but the Water encreasing in the Hold it was apparent that the Ship would founder and tho' the Storm began to abate a little yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a Port so the Master continued firing Guns for Help and a light Ship who had rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to help us It was with the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us but it was impossible for us to get on Board or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side till at last the Men rowing very heartily and venturing their Lives to save ours our Men cast them a Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it and then vered it out a great Length which they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and we hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat It was to no Purpose for them or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship so all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards Shore as much as we could and our Master promised them That if the Boat was stav'd upon Shore he would make it good to their Master so partly rowing and partly driving our Boat went away to the Norward sloaping towards the Shore almost as far as  Winterton Ness    We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out of our Ship but we saw her sink and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a Ship foundering in the Sea I must acknowledge  I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Seamen told me she was sinking for from that Moment they rather put me into the Boat than that I might be said to go in my Heart was as it were dead within me partly with Fright partly with Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was yet before me  While we were in this Condition the Men yet labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the Shore we could see when our Boat mounting the Waves we were able to see the Shore a great many People running along the Shore to assist us when we should come near but we made but slow way towards the Shore nor were we able to reach the Shore till being past the LightHouse at  Winterton  the Shore falls off to the Westward towards  Cromer  and so the Land broke off a little the Violence of the Wind Here we got in and tho' not without much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walk'd afterwards on Foot to  Yarmouth  where as unfortunate Men we were used with great Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the Town who assign'd us good Quarters as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships and had Money given us sufficient to carry us either to  London  or back to  Hull  as we thought fit  Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to  Hull  and have gone home I had been happy and my Father an Emblem of our Blessed Saviour's Parable had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me for hearing the Ship I went away in was cast away in  Yarmouth  Road it was a great while before he had any Assurance that I was not drown'd  But my ill Fate push'd me on now with an Obstinacy that nothing could resist and tho' I had several times loud Calls from my Reason and my more composed Judgment to go home yet I had  no Power to do it I know not what to call this nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling Decree that hurries us on to be the Instruments of our own Destruction even tho' it be before us and that we rush upon it with our Eyes open Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable Misery attending and which it was impossible for me to escape could have push'd me forward against the calm Reasonings and Perswasions of my most retired Thoughts and against two such visible Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt  My Comrade who had help'd to harden me before and who was the Master's Son was now less forward than I the first time he spoke to me after we were at  Yarmouth  which was not till two or three Days for we were separated in the Town to several Quarters I say the first time he saw me it appear'd his Tone was alter'd and looking very melancholy and shaking his Head ask'd me how I did and telling his Father who I was and how I had come this Voyage only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad his Father turning to me with a very grave and concern'd Tone  Young Man  says he  you ought never to go to Sea any more you ought to take this for a plain and visible Token that you are not to be a Seafaring Man  why Sir said I will you go to Sea no more  That is another Case  said he  it is my Calling and therefore my Duty but as you made this Voyage for a Trial you see what a Taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if ou persist perhaps this is all befallen us on your Account like  Jonah  in the Ship of  Tarshish  Pray  continues he  what are you and on what Account did you go to Sea  Upon that I told him some of my Story at the End of which he burst out with a strange kind of Passion What had I done says he that such an unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship I would not set my Foot in  the same Ship with thee again for a Thousand Pounds This indeed was as I said an Excursion of his Spirits which were yet agitated by the Sense of his Loss and was farther than he could have Authority to go However he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me exhorted me to go back to my Father and not tempt Providence to my Ruine told me I might see a visible Hand of Heaven against me  And young Man  said he  depend upon it if you do not go back whereever you go you will meet with nothing but Disasters and Disappointments till your Father's Words are fulfilled upon you    We parted soon after for I made him little Answer and I saw him no more which way he went I know not As for me having some Money in my Pocket I travelled to  London  by Land and there as well as on the Road had many Struggles with my self what Course of Life I should take and whether I should go Home or go to Sea  As to going Home Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my Thoughts and it immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at among the Neighbours and should be asham'd to see not my Father and Mother only but even every Body else from whence I have since often observed how incongruous and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is especially of Youth to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases  viz  That they are not asham'd to sin and yet are asham'd to repent not asham'd of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteemed Fools but are asham'd of the returning which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men  In this State of Life however I remained some time uncertain what Measures to take and what Course of Life to lead An irresistible Reluctance continu'd to going Home and as I stay'd a while  the Remembrance of the Distress I had been in wore off and as that abated the little Motion I had in my Desires to a Return wore off with it till at last I quite lay'd aside the Thoughts of it and lookt out for a Voyage  That evil Influence which carryed me first away from my Father's House that hurried me into the wild and indigested Notion of raising my Fortune and that imprest those Conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good Advice and to the Entreaties and even Command of my Father I say the same Influence whatever it was presented the most unfortunate of all Enterprises to my View and I went on board a Vessel bound to the Coast of  Africa  or as our Sailors vulgarly call it a Voyage to  Guinea    It was my great Misfortune that in all these Adventures I did not ship my self as a Sailor whereby tho' I might indeed have workt a little harder than ordinary yet at the same time I had learn'd the Duty and Office of a Foremast Man and in time might have quallified my self for a Mate or Lieutenant if not for a Master But as it was always my Fate to choose for the worse so I did here for having Money in my Pocket and good Cloaths upon my Back I would always go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman and so I neither had any Business in the Ship or learn'd to do any  It was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in  London  which does not always happen to such loose and unguided young Fellows as I then was the Devil generally not omitting to lay some Snare for them very early But it was not so with me I first fell acquainted with the Master of a Ship who had been on the Coast of  Guinea  and who having had very good Success there was resolved  to go again and who taking a Fancy to my Conversation which was not at all disagreeable at that time hearing me say I had a mind to see the Word told me if I wou'd go the Voyage with him I should be at no Expence I should be his Messmate and his Companion and if I could carry any thing with me I should have all the Advantage of it that the Trade would admit and perhaps I might meet with some Encouragement  I embrac'd the Offer and entring into a strict Friendship with this Captain who was an honest and plaindealing Man I went the Voyage with him and carried a small Adventure with me which by the disinterested Honesty of my Friend the Captain I increased very considerably for I carried about  l  in such Toys and Trifles as the Captain directed me to buy This  l  I had mustered together by the Assistance of some of my Relations whom I corresponded with and who I believe got my Father or at least my Mother to contribute so much as that to my first Adventure  This was the only Voyage which I may say was successful in all my Adventures and which I owe to the Integrity and Honesty of my Friend the Captain under whom also I got a competent Knowledge of the Mathematicks and the Rules of Navigation learn'd how to keep an Account of the Ship's Course take an Observation and in short to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a Sailor For as he took Delight to introduce me I took Delight to learn and in a word this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a Merchant for I brought Home  L    Ounces  of Gold Dust for my Adventure which yielded me in  London  at my Return almost  l  and this fill'd me with those aspiring Thoughts which have since so compleated my Ruin  Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes too particularly that I was continually sick being thrown into a violent Calenture by the excessive Heat of the Climate our principal Trading being upon the Coast from the Latitude of Degrees North even to the Line it self  I was now set up for a  Guiney  Trader and my Friend to my great Misfortune dying soon after his Arrival I resolved to go the same Voyage again and I embark'd in the same Vessel with one who was his Mate in the former Voyage and had now got the Command of the Ship This was the unhappiest Voyage that ever Man made for tho' I did not carry quite  l  of my new gain'd Wealth so that I had left and which I lodg'd with my Friend's Widow who was very just to me yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage and the first was this  viz  Our Ship making her Course towards the  Canary  Islands or rather between those Islands and the  African  Shore was surprised in the Grey of the Morning by a  Turkish  Rover of  Sallee  who gave Chase to us with all the Sail she could make We crowded also as much Canvass as our Yards would spread or our Masts carry to have got clear but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us and would certainly come up with us in a few Hours we prepar'd to fight our Ship having Guns and the Rogue About three in the Afternoon he came up with us and bringing to by Mistake just athwart our Quarter instead of athwart our Stern as he intended we brought of our Guns to bear on that Side and pour'd in a Broadside upon him which made him sheer off again after returning our Fire and pouring in also his small Shot from near Men which he had on Board However we had not a Man touch'd all our Men keeping close He prepar'd to attack us  again and we to defend our selves but laying us on Board the next time upon our other Quarter he entred Men upon our Decks who immediatel fell to cutting and hacking the Decks and Rigging We ply'd them with Smallshot HalfPikes PowderChests and such like and clea'rd our Deck of them twice However to cut short this melancholly Part of our Story our Ship being disabled and three of our Men kill'd and eight wounded we were obliged to yield and were carry'd all Prisoners into  Sallee  a Port belonging to the  Moors    The Usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended nor was I carried up the Country to the Emperor's Court as the rest of our Men were but was kept by the Captain of the Rover as his proper Prize and made his Slave being young and nimble and fit for his Business At this surprising Change of my Circumstances from a Merchant to a miserable Slave I was perfectly overwhelmed and now I look'd back upon my Father's prophetick Discourse to me that I should be miserable and have none to relieve me which I thought was now so effectually brought to pass that it could not be worse that now the Hand of Heaven had overtaken me and I was undone without Redemption But alas this was but a Taste of the Misery I was to go thro' as will appear in the Sequel of this Story  As my new Patron or Master had taken me Home to his House so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to Sea again believing that it would some time or other be his Fate to be taken by a  Spanish  or  Portugal  Man of War and that then I should be set at Liberty But this Hope of mine was soon taken away for when he went to Sea he left me on Shoar to look after his  little Garden and do the common Drudgery of Slaves about his House and when he came home again from his Cruise he order'd me to lye in the Cabbin to look after the Ship  Here I meditated nothing but my Escape and what Method I might take to effect it but found no Way that had the least Probability in it Nothing presented to make the Supposition of it rational for I had no Body to communicate it to that would embark with me no FellowSlave no  Englishman Irishman  or  Scotsman  there but my self so that for two Years tho' I often pleased my self with the Imagination yet I never had the least encouraging Prospect of putting it in Practice  After about two Years an odd Circumstance presented it self which put the old Thought of making some Attempt for my Liberty again in my Head My Patron lying at Home longer than usual without fitting out his Ship which as I heard was for want of Money he used constantly once or twice a Week sometimes oftner if the Weather was fair to take the Ship's Pinnace and go out into the Road afishing and as he always took me and a young  Maresco  with him to row the Boat we made him very merry and I prov'd very dexterous in catching Fish insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a  Moor  one of his Kinsmen and the Youth the  Maresco  as they call'd him to catch a Dish of Fish for him  It happen'd one time that going a fishing in a stark calm Morning a Fog rose so thick that tho' we were not half a League from the Shoar we lost Sight of it and rowing we knew not whither or which way we labour'd all Day and all the next Night and when the Morning came we found we had pull'd off to Sea instead of pulling in for the Shoar and that we were at least two Leagues from  the Shoar However we got well in again tho' with a great deal of Labour and some Danger for the Wind began to blow pretty fresh in the Morning but particularly we were all very hungry  But our Patron warn'd by this Disaster resolved to take more Care of himself for the future and having lying by him the Longboat of our  English  Ship we had taken he resolved he would not go a fishing any more without a Compass and some Provision so he ordered the Carpenter of his Ship who also was an  English  Slave to build a little Stateroom or Cabin in the middle of the Long Boat like that of a Barge with a Place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the Mainsheet and Room before for a hand or two to stand and work the Sails she sail'd with that we call a Shoulder of Mutton Sail and the Boom gib'd over the Top of the Cabbin which lay very snug and low and had in it Room for him to lye with a Slave or two and a Table to eat on with some small Lockers to put in some Bottles of such Liquor as he thought fit to drink in particularly his Bread Rice and Coffee  We went frequently out with this Boat a fishing and as I was most dextrous to catch fish for him he never went without me It happen'd that he had appointed to go out in this Boat either for Pleasure or for Fish with two or three  Moors  of some Distinction in that Place and for whom he had provided extraordinarily and had therefore sent on board the Boat over Night a larger Store of Provisions than ordinary and had order'd me to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot which were on board his Ship for that they design'd some Sport of Fowling as well as Fishing  I got all things ready as he had directed and waited the next Morning with the Boat washed  clean her Antient and Pendants out and every thing to accomodate his Guests when by and by my Patroon came on board alone and told me his Guests had put off going upon some Business that fell out and order'd me with the Man and Boy as usual to go out with the Boat and catch them some Fish for that his Friends were to sup at his House and commanded that as soon as I had got some Fish I should bring it home to his House all which I prepar'd to do  This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance darted into my Thoughts for now I found I was like to have a little Ship at my Command and my Master being gone I prepar'd to furnish my self not for a fishing Business but for a Voyage tho' I knew not neither did I so much as consider whither I should steer for any where to get out of that Place was my Way  My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to speak to this  Moor  to get something for our Subsistance on board for I told him we must not presume to eat of our Patroon's Bread he said that was true so he brought a large Basket of Rusk or Bisket of their kind and three Jarrs with fresh Water into the Boat I knew where my Patroon's Case of Bottles stood which it was evident by the make were taken out of some  English  Prize and I convey'd them into the Boat while the  Moor  was on Shoar as if they had been there before for our Master I convey'd also a great Lump of BeesWax into the Boat which weighed above half a Hundred Weight with a Parcel of Twine or Thread a Hatchet a Saw and a Hammer all which were of great Use to us afterwards especially the Wax to make Candles Another Trick I try'd upon him which he innocently came into also his Name was  Ismael  who they call  Muly  or  Moely  so I call'd to him  Moely  said I our Patroon's Guns are on board the Boat can you not get a little Powder and Shot it may be we may kill some  Alcamies  a Fowl like our  Curlieus  for our selves for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in the Ship Yes  says he  I'll bring some and accordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch which held about a Pound and half of Powder or rather more and another with Shot that had five or six Pound with some Bullets and put all into the Boat At the same time I had found some Powder of my Masters in the Great Cabbin with which I fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Case which was almost empty pouring what was in it into another and thus furnished with every thing needful we sail'd out of the Port to fish The Castle which is at the Entrance of the Port knew who we were and took no Notice of us and we were not above a Mile out of the Port before we hal'd in our Sail and set us down to fish The Wind blew from the N NE which was contrary to my Desire for had it blown southerly I had been sure to have made the Coast of  Spain  and at least reacht to the Bay of  Cadiz  but my Resolutions were blow which way it would I would be gone from that horrid Place where I was and leave the rest to Fate  After we had fisht some time and catcht nothing for when I had Fish on my Hook I would not pull them up that he might not see them I said to the  Moor  this will not do our Master will not be thus serv'd we must stand farther off He thinking no harm agreed and being in the head of the Boat set the Sails and as I had the Helm I run the Boat out near a League farther and then brought her too as if I would fish when giving the Boy the Helm I stept forward to where the  Moor  was and making as if I stoopt for something  hehind him I took him by Surprize with my Arm under his Twist and tost him clear overboard into the Sea he rise immediately for he swam like a Cork and call'd to me begg'd to be taken in told me he would go all over the World with me he swam so strong after the Boat that he would have reacht me very quickly there bieng but little Wind upon which I stept into the Cabbin and fetching one of the Fowlingpieces I presented it at him and told him I had done him no hurt and if he would be quiet I would do him none but said I you swim well enough to reach to the Shoar and the Sea is calm make the best of your Way to Shoar and I will do you no harm but if you come near the Boat I'll shoot you thro' the Head for I am resolved to have my Liberty so he turn'd himself about and swam for the Shoar and I make no doubt but he reacht it with Ease for he was an Excellent Swimmer  I could ha' been content to ha' taken this  Moor  with me and ha' drown'd the Boy but there was no venturing to trust him When he was gone I turn'd to the Boy who they call'd  Xury  and said to him  Xury  if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a great Man but if you will not stroak your Face to be true to me  that is swear by  Mahomet  and his Father's Beard  I must throw you into the Sea too the Boy smil'd in my Face and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust him and swore to be faithful to me and go all over the World with me  While I was in View of the  Moor  that was swimming I stood out directly to Sea with the Boat rather stretching to Windward that they might think me gone towards the  Straits  mouth as indeed any one that had been in their Wits must ha' been supposed to do for who would ha' suppos'd we were saild  on to the southward to the truly  Barbarian  Coast where whole Nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with their Canoes and destroy us where we could ne'er once go on shoar but we should be devour'd by savage Beasts or more merciless Savages of humane kind  But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening I chang'd my Course and steer'd directly South and by East bending my Course a little toward the East that I might keep in with the Shoar and having a fair fresh Gale of Wind and a smooth quiet Sea I made such Sail that I believe by the next Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon when I first made the Land I could not be less than Miles South of  Sallee  quite beyond the Emperor of  Morocco  's Dominions or indeed of any other King thereabouts for we saw no People  Yet such was the Fright I had taken at the  Moors  and the dreadful Apprehensions I had of falling into their Hands that I would not stop or go on Shoar or come to an Anchor the Wind continuing fair 'till I had sail'd in that manner five Days And then the Wind shifting to the southward I concluded also that if any of our Vessels were in Chase of me they also would now give over so I ventur'd to make to the Coast and came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little River I knew not what or where neither what Latitude what Country what Nations or what River I neither saw or desir'd to see any People the principal thing I wanted was fresh Water We came into this Creek in the Evening resolving to swim on shoar as soon as it was dark and discover the Country but as soon as it was quite dark we heard such dreadful Noises of the Barking Roaring and Howling of Wild Creatures of we knew not what Kinds that the poor Boy was ready to die with  Fear and beg'd of me not to go on shoar till Day well  Xury  said I then I won't but it may be we may see Men by Day who will be as bad to us as those Lyons  then we give them the shoot Gun  says  Xury  laughing  make them run wey  such  English Xury  spoke by conversing among us Slaves however I was glad to see the Boy so cheerful and I gave him a Dram out of our Patroon's Case of Bottles to chear him up After all  Xury  's Advice was good and I took it we dropt our little Anchor and lay still all Night I say still for we slept none for in two or three Hours we saw vast great Creatures we knew not what to call them of many sorts come down to the Seashoar and run into the Water wallowing and washing themselves for the Pleasure of cooling themselves and they made such hideous Howlings and Yellings that I never indeed heard the like  Xury  was dreadfully frighted and indeed so was I too but we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty Creatures come swimming towards our Boat we could not see him but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious Beast  Xury  said it was a Lyon and it might be so for ought I know but poor  Xury  cryed to me to weigh the Anchor and row away no says I  Xury  we can slip our Cable with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea they cannot follow us far I had no sooner said so but I perceiv'd the Creature whatever it was within Two Oars Length which something surprized me however I immediately stept to the Cabbindoor and taking up my Gun fir'd at him upon which he immediately turn'd about and swam towards the Shoar again  But it is impossible to describe the horrible Noises and hideous Cryes and Howlings that were  raised as well upon the Edge of the Shoar as higher within the Country upon the Noise or Report of the Gun a Thing I have some Reason to believe those Creatures had never heard before This Convinc'd me that there was no going on Shoar for us in the Night upon that Coast and how to venture on Shoar in the Day was another Question too for to have fallen into the Hands of any of the Savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the Hands of Lyons and Tygers at least we were equally apprehensive of the Danger of it  Be that as it would we were oblig'd to go on Shoar somewhere or other for Water for we had not a Pint left in the Boat when or where to get to it was the Point  Xury  said if I would let him go on Shoar with one of the Jarrs he would find if there was any Water and bring some to me I ask'd him why he would go Why I should not go and he stay in the Boat The Boy answer'd with so much Affection that made me love him ever after Says he  If wild Mans come they eat me you go wey  Well  Xury  said I we will both go and if the wild Man's come we will kill them they shall Eat neither of us so I gave  Xury  a piece of Ruskbread to Eat and a Dram out of our Patroons Case of Bottles which I mentioned before and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shoar as we thought was proper and so waded on Shoar carrying nothing but our Arms and two Jarrs for Water  I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat fearing the coming of Canoes with  Savages  down the River but the Boy seeing a low Place about a Mile up the Country rambled to it and by and by I saw him come running towards me I thought he was pursued by some Savage or  frighted with some wild Beast and I run forward towards him to help him but when I came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his Shoulders which was a Creature that he had shot like a Hare but different in Colour and longer Legs however we were very glad of it and it was very good Meat but the great Joy that poor  Xury  came with was to tell me he had found good Water and seen no wild Mans  But we found afterwards that we need not take such Pains for Water for a little higher up the Creek where we were we found the Water fresh when the Tide was out which flowed but a little way up so we filled our Jarrs and feasted on the Hare we had killed and prepared to go on our Way having seen no Footsteps of any humane Creature in that part of the Country  As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before I knew very well that the Islands of the  Canaries  and the  Cape de Verd  Islands also lay not far off from the Coast But as I had no Instruments to take an Observation to know what Latitude we were in and did not exactly know or at least remember what Latitude they were in I knew not where to look for them or when to stand off to Sea towards them otherwise I might now easily have found some of these Islands But my hope was that if I stood along this Coast till I came to that Part where the  English  Traded I should find some of their Vessels upon their usual Design of Trade that would relieve and take us in  By the best of my Calculation that Place were I now was must be that Country which lying between the Emperor of  Morocco  's Dominions and the  Negro  's lies wast and uninhabited except by wild Beasts the  Negroes  having abandon'd it and gone farther South for fear of the  Moors  and the  Moors  not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its Barrenness and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers Lyons Leopards and other furious Creatures which harbour there so that the  Moors  use it for their Hunting only where they go like an Army two or three thousand Men at a time and indeed for near an hundred Miles together upon this Coast we saw nothing but a wast uninhabited Country by Day and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of wild Beasts by Night  Once or twice in the Day time I thought I saw the  Pico  of  Teneriffe  being the high top of the Mountain  Teneriffe  in the  Canaries  and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither but having tried twice I was forced in again by contrary Winds the Sea also going too high for my little Vessel so I resolved to pursue my first Design and keep along the Shoar  Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water after we had left this Place and once in particular being early in the Morning we came to an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was pretty high and the Tide beginning to flow we lay still to go farther in  Xury  whose Eyes were more about him than it seems mine were calls softly to me and tells me that we had best go farther off the Shoar for says he look yonder lies a dreadful Monster on the side of that Hillock fast asleep I look'd where he pointed and saw a dreadful Monster indeed for it was a terrible great Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shoar under the Shade of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were a little over him  Xury  says I you shall go on Shoar and kill him  Xury  look'd frighted and said  Me kill he eat me at one Mouth  one Mouthful he meant however I said no more to the Boy but  bad him lye still and I took our biggest Gun which was almost Musquetbore and loaded it with a good Charge of Powder and with two Slugs and laid it down then I loaded another Gun with two Bullets and the third for we had three Pieces I loaded with five smaller Bullets I took the best aim I could with the first Piece to have shot him into the Head but he lay so with his Leg rais'd a little above his Nose that the Slugs hit his Leg about the Knee and broke the Bone He started up growling at first but finding his Leg broke fell down again and then got up upon three Legs and gave the most hideous Roar that ever I heard I was a little suppriz'd that I had not hit him on the Head however I took up the second Piece immediately and tho' he began to move off fir'd again and shot him into the Head and had the Pleasure to see him drop and make but little Noise but lay struggling for Life Then  Xury  took Heart and would have me let him go on Shoar Well go said I so the Boy jump'd into the Water and taking a little Gun in one Hand swam to Shoar with the other Hand and coming close to the Creature put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear and shot him into the Head again which dispatch'd him quite  This was Game indeed to us but this was no Food and I was very sorry to lose three Charges of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good for nothing to us However  Xury  said he would have some of him so he comes on board and ask'd me to give him the Hatchet for what  Xury  said I  Me cut off his Head  said he However  Xury  could not cut off his Head but he cut off a Foot and brought it with him and it was a monstrous great one  I bethought my self however that perhaps the Skin of him might one way or other be of some Value to us and I resolved to take off his Skin if I could So  Xury  and I went to work with him but  Xury  was much the better Workman at it for I knew very ill how to do it Indeed it took us up both the whole Day but at last we got of the Hide of him and spreading it on the top of our Cabbin the Sun effectually dried it in two Days time and it afterwards serv'd me to lye upon  After this Stop we made on to the Southward continually for ten or twelve Days living very sparing on our Provisions which began to abate very much and going no oftner into the Shoar than we were oblig'd to for fresh Water my Design in this was to make the River  Gambia  or  Sennegall  that is to say any where about the  Cape de Verd  where I was in hopes to meet with some  European  Ship and if I did not I knew not what Course I had to take but to seek out for the  Islands  or perish there among the  Negroes  I knew that all the Ships from  Europe  which sail'd either to the Coast of  Guiney  or to  Brasil  or to the  EastIndies  made this  Cape  or those  Islands  and in a word I put the whole of my Fortune upon this single Point either that I must meet with some Ship or must perish  When I had pursued this Resolution about ten Days longer as I have said I began to see that the Land was inhabited and in two or three Places as we sailed by we saw People stand upon the Shoar to look at us we could also perceive they were quite Black and Starknaked I was once inclin'd to ha' gone on Shoar to them but  Xury  was my better Councellor and said to me  no go no go  however I hal'd in nearer the Shoar that I might talk to them and I found they run along the Shoar by me a good way I observ'd they had  no Weapons in their Hands except one who had a long slender Stick which  Xury  said was a Lance and that they would throw them a great way with good aim so I kept at a distance but talk'd with them by Signs as well as I could and particularly made Signs for some thing to Eat they beckon'd to me to stop my Boat and that they would fetch me some Meat upon this I lower'd the top of my Sail and lay by and two of them run up into the Country and in less than half an Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flesh and some Corn such as is the Produce of their Country but we neither knew what the one or the other was however we were willing to accept it but how to come at it was our next Dispute for I was not for venturing on Shore to them and they were as much affraid of us but they took a safe way for us all for they brought it to the Shore and laid it down and went and stood a great way off till we fetch'd it on Board and then came close to us again  We made Signs of Thanks to them for we had nothing to make them amends but an Opportunity offer'd that very Instant to oblige them wonderfully for while we were lying by the Shore came two mighty Creatures one pursuing the other as we took it with great Fury from the Mountains towards the Sea whether it was the Male pursuing the Female or whether they were in Sport or in Rage we could not tell any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange but I believe it was the latter because in the first Place those ravenous Creatures seldom appear but in the Night and in the second Place we found the People terribly frighted especially the Women The Man that had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them but the rest did however as the two Creatures  ran directly into the Water they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the  Negroes  but plung'd themselves into the Sea and swam about as if they had come for their Diversion at last one of them began to come nearer our Boat than at first I expected but I lay ready for him for I had loaded my Gun with all possible Expedition and bad  Xury  load both the other as soon as he came fairly within my reach I fir'd and shot him directly into the Head immediately he sunk down into the Water but rose instantly and plung'd up and down as if he was struggling for Life and so indeed he was he immediately made to the Shore but between the Wound which was his mortal Hurt and the strangling of the Water he dyed just before he reach'd the Shore  It is impossible to express the Astonishment of these poor Creatures at the Noise and the Fire of my Gun some of them were even ready to dye for Fear and fell down as Dead with the very Terror But when they saw the Creature dead and sunk in the Water and that I made Signs to them to come to the Shore they took Heart and came to the Shore and began to search for the Creature I found him by his Blood staining the Water and by the help of a Rope which I slung round him and gave the  Negroes  to hawl they drag'd him on Shore and found that it was a most curious Leopard spotted and fine to an admirable Degree and the  Negroes  held up their Hands with Admiration to think what it was I had kill'd him with  The other Creature frighted with the flash of Fire and the Noise of the Gun swam on Shore and ran up directly to the Mountains from whence they came nor could I at that Distance know what it was I found quickly the  Negroes  were for eating the Flesh of this Creature so I was willing  to have them take it as a Favour from me which when I made Signs to them that they might take him they were very thankful for immediately they fell to work with him and tho' they had no Knife yet with a sharpen'd Piece of Wood they took off his Skin as readily and much more readily than we cou'd have done with a Knife they offer'd me some of the Flesh which I declined making as if I would give it them but made Signs for the Skin which they gave me very freely and brought me a great deal more of their Provision which tho' I did not understand yet I accepted then I made Signs to them for some Water and held out one of my Jarrs to them turning it bottom upward to shew that it was empty and that I wanted to have it filled They call'd immediately to some of their Friends and there came two Women and brought a great Vessel made of Earth and burnt as I suppose in the Sun this they set down for me as before and I sent  Xury  on Shore with my Jarrs and filled them all three The Women were as stark Naked as the Men  I was now furnished with Roots and Corn such as it was and Water and leaving my friendly  Negroes  I made forward for about eleven Days more without offering to go near the Shoar till I saw the Land run out a great Length into the Sea at about the Distance of four or five Leagues before me and the Sea being very calm I kept a large offing to make this Point at length doubling the Point at about two Leagues from the Land I saw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward then I concluded as it was most certain indeed that this was the  Cape de Verd  and those the  Islands  call'd from thence  Cape de Verd Islands  However they were at a great Distance and I could not well tell what I had best to do for if I  should be taken with a Fresh of Wind I might neither reach one or other  In this Dilemna as I was very pensive I stept into the Cabbin and sat me down  Xury  having the Helm when on a suddain the Boy cry'd out  Master Master a Ship with a Sail  and the foolish Boy was frighted out of his Wits thinking it must needs be some of his Master's Ships sent to pursue us when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach I jump'd out of the Cabbin and immediately saw not only the Ship but what she was  viz  that it was a  Portuguese  Ship and as I thought was bound to the Coast of  Guinea  for  Negroes  But when I observ'd the Course she steer'd I was soon convinc'd they were bound some other way and did not design to come any nearer to the Shoar upon which I stretch'd out to Sea as much as I could resolving to speak with them if possible  With all the Sail I could make I found I should not be able to come in their Way but that they would be gone by before I could make any Signal to them but after I had crowded to the utmost and began to despair they it seems saw me by the help of their PerspectiveGlasses and that it was some  European  Boat which as they supposed must belong to some Ship that was lost so they shortned Sail to let me come up I was encouraged with this and as I had my Patroon's Antient on Board I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal of Distress and fir'd a Gun both which they saw for they told me they saw the Smoke tho' they did not hear the Gun upon these Signals they very kindly brought too and lay by for me and in about three Hours time I came up with them  They ask'd me what I was in  Portuguese  and in  Spanish  and in  French  but I understood none of  them but at last a  Scots  Sailor who was on board call'd to me and I answer'd him and told him I was an  Englishman  that I had made my escape out of Slavery from the  Moors  at  Sallee  then they bad me come on board and very kindly took me in and all my Goods  It was an inexpressible Joy to me that any one will believe that I was thus deliver'd as I esteem'd it from such a miserable and almost hopeless Condition as I was in and I immediately offered all I had to the Captain of the Ship as a Return for my Deliverance but he generously told me he would take nothing from me but that all I had should be deliver'd safe to me when I came to the  Brasils  for says he  I have sav'd your Life on no other Terms than I would be glad to be saved my self and it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the same Condition besides  said he  when I carry you to the  Brasils  so great a way from your own Country if I should take from you what you have you will be starved there and then I only take away that Life I have given No no Seignor  Inglese says he  Mr  Englishman  I will carry you thither in Charity and those things will help you to buy your Subsistance there and your Passage home again    As he was Charitable in his Proposal so he was Just in the Performance to a tittle for he ordered the Seamen that none should offer to touch any thing I had then he took every thing into his own Possession and gave me back an exact Inventory of them that I might have them even so much as my three Earthen Jarrs  As to my Boat it was a very good one and that he saw and told me he would buy it of me for the Ship's use and ask'd me what I would have for it I told him he had been so generous to me in every thing that I could not offer to make any  Price of the Boat but left it entirely to him upon which he told me he would give me a Note of his Hand to pay me Pieces of Eight for it at  Brasil  and when it came there if any one offer'd to give more he would make it up he offer'd me also Pieces of Eight more for my Boy  Xury  which I was loath to take not that I was not willing to let the Captain have him but I was very loath to sell the poor Boy's Liberty who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own However when I let him know my Reason he own'd it to be just and offer'd me this Medium that he would give the Boy an Obligation to set him free in ten Years if he turn'd Christian upon this and  Xury  saying he was willing to go to him I let the Captain have him  We had a very good Voyage to the  Brasils  and arriv'd in the  Bay de Todos los Santos  or  AllSaints Bay  in about Twentytwo Days after And now I was once more deliver'd from the most miserable of all Conditions of Life and what to do next with my self I was now to consider  The generous Treatment the Captain gave me I can never enough remember he would take nothing of me for my Passage gave me twenty Ducats for the Leopard's Skin and forty for the Lyon's Skin which I had in my Boat and caused every thing I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd me and what I was willing to sell he bought such as the Case of Bottles two of my Guns and a Piece of the Lump of Beeswax for I had made Candles of the rest in a word I made about Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo and with this Stock I went on Shoar in the  Brasilo    I had not been long here but being recommended to the House of a good honest Man like himself who had an  Ingeino  as they call it that is a  Plantation and a SugarHouse I lived with him some time and acquainted my self by that means with the Manner of their planting and making of Sugar and seeing how well the Planters liv'd and how they grew rich suddenly I resolv'd if I could get Licence to settle there I would turn Planter among them resolving in the mean time to find out some Way to get my Money which I had left in  London  remitted to me To this Purpose getting a kind of a Letter of Naturalization I purchased as much Land that was Uncur'd as my Money would reach and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement and such a one as might be suitable to the Stock which I proposed to my self to receive from  England    I had a Neighbour a  Portugueze  of  Lisbon  but born of  English  Parents whose Name was  Wells  and in much such Circumstances as I was I call him my Neighbour because his Plantation lay next to mine and we went on very sociably together My Stock was but low as well as his and we rather planted for Food than any thing else for about two Years However we began to increase and our Land began to come into Order so that the third Year we planted some Tobacco and made each of us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes in the Year to come but we both wanted Help and now I found more than before I had done wrong in parting with my Boy  Xury    But alas for me to do wrong that never did right was no great Wonder I had no Remedy but to go on I was gotten into an Employment quite remote to my Genius and directly contrary to the Life I delighted in and for which I forsook my Father's House and broke thro' all his good Advice nay I was coming into the very Middle Station or upper Degree of low Life which my Father advised me to before and which if I resolved to go on  with I might as well ha' staid at Home and never have fatigu'd my self in the World as I had done and I used often to say to my self I could ha' done this as well in  England  among my Friends as ha' gone Miles off to do it among Strangers and Salvages in a Wilderness and at such a Distance as never to hear from any Part of the World that had the least Knowledge of me  In this manner I used to look upon my Condition with the utmost Regret I had no body to converse with but now and then this Neighbour no Work to be done but by the Labour of my Hands and I used to say I liv'd just like a Man cast away upon some desolate Island that had no body there but himself But how just has it been and how should all Men reflect that when they compare their present Conditions with others that are worse Heaven may oblige them to make the Exchange and be convinc'd of their former Felicity by their Experience I say how just has it been that the truly solitary Life I reflected on in an Island of meer Desolation should be my Lot who had so often unjustly compar'd it with the Life which I then led in which had I continued I had in all Probability been exceeding prosperous and rich  I was in some Degree settled in my Measures for carrying on the Plantation before my kind Friend the Captain of the Ship that took me up at Sea went back for the Ship remained there in providing his Loading and preparing for his Voyage near three Months when telling him what little Stock I had left behind me in  London  he gave me this friendly and sincere Advice  Seignior Inglese says he  for so he always called me if you will give me Letters and a Procuration here in Form to me with Orders to the Person who has your Money in  London  to send your Effects to  Lisbon  to such Persons as I shall direct  and in such Goods as are proper for this Country I will bring you the Produce of them God willing at my Return but since human Affairs are all subject to Changes and Disasters I would have you give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds  Sterl  which you say is Half your Stock and let the Hazard be run for the first so that if it come safe you may order the rest the same Way and if it miscarry you may have the other Half to have Recourse to for your Supply  This was so wholesom Advice and look'd so friendly that I could not but be convinc'd it was the best Course I could take so I accordingly prepared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had left my Money and a Procuration to the  Portuguese  Captain as he desired  I wrote the  English  Captain's Widow a full Account of all my Adventures my Slavery Escape and how I had met with the  Portugal  Captain at Sea the Humanity of his Behaviour and in what Condition I was now in with all other necessary Directions for my Supply and when this honest Captain came to  Lisbon  he found means by some of the  English  Merchants there to send over not the Order only but a full Account of my Story to a Merchant at  London  who represented it effectually to her whereupon she not only delivered the Money but out of her own Pocket sent the  Portugal  Captain a very handsom Present for his Humanity and Charity to me  The Merchant in  London  vesting this Hundred Pounds in  English  Goods such as the Captain had writ for sent them directly to him at  Lisbon  and he brought them all safe to me to the  Brasils  among which without my Direction for I was too young in my Business to think of them he had taken Care to have all Sorts of Tools IronWork and Utensils  necessary for my Plantation and which were of great Use to me  When this Cargo arrived I thought my Fortunes made for I was surprised with the Joy of it and my good Steward the Captain had laid out the Five Pounds which my Friend had sent him for a Present for himself to purchase and bring me over a Servant under Bond for six Years Service and would not accept of any Consideration except a little Tobacco which I would have him accept being of my own Produce  Neither was this all but my Goods being all  English  Manufactures such as Cloath Stuffs Bays and things particularly valuable and desirable in the Country I found means to sell them to a very great Advantage so that I might say I had more than four times the Value of my first Cargo and was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour I mean in the Advancement of my Plantation for the first thing I did I bought me a Negro Slave and an  European  Servant also I mean another besides that which the Captain brought me from  Lisbon    But as abus'd Prosperity is oftentimes made the very Means of our greatest Adversity so was it with me I went on the next Year with great Success in my Plantation I raised fifty great Rolls of Tobacco on my own Ground more than I had disposed of for Necessaries among my Neighbours and these fifty Rolls being each of above a  Wt  were well cur'd and laid by against the Return of the Fleet from  Lisbon  and now increasing in Business and in Wealth my Head began to be full of Projects and Undertakings beyond my Reach such as are indeed often the Ruine of the best Heads in Business  Had I continued in the Station I was now in I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for which my Father so earnestly recommended a quiet retired Life and of which he had so sensibly describ'd the middle Station of Life to be full of but other things attended me and I was still to be the wilful Agent of all my own Miseries and particularly to encrease my Fault and double the Reflections upon my self which in my future Sorrows I should have leisure to make all these Miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandring abroad and pursuing that Inclination in contradiction to the clearest Views of doing my self good in a fair and plain pursuit of those Prospects and those measures of Life which Nature and Providence concurred to present me with and to make my Duty  As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my Parents so I could not be content now but I must go and leave the happy View I had of being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantation only to pursue a rash and immoderate Desire of rising faster than the Nature of the Thing admitted and thus I cast my self down again into the deepest Gulph of human Misery that ever Man fell into or perhaps could be consistent with Life and a State Health of in the World  To come then by the just Degrees to the Particulars of this Part of my Story you may suppose that having now lived almost four Years in the  Brasilo  and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my Plantation I had not only learn'd the Language but had contracted Acquaintance and Friendship among my FellowPlanters as well as among the Merchants at St  Salvadore  which was our Port and that in my Discourses among  them I had frequently given them an Account of my two Voyages to the Coast of  Guinea  the manner of Trading with the  Negroes  there and how easy it was to purchase upon the Coast for Trifles such as Beads Toys Knives Scissars Hatchets bits of Glass and the like not only Gold Dust  Guinea  Grains Elephants Teeth  c  but  Negroes  for the Service of the  Brasils  in great Numbers  They listened always very attentively to my Discourses on these Heads but especially to that Part which related to the buying  Negroes  which was a Trade at that time not only not far entred into but as far as it was had been carried on by the Assiento's or Permission of the Kings of  Spain  and  Portugal  and engross'd in the Publick so that few  Negroes  were brought and those excessive dear  It happen'd being in Company with some Merchants and Planters of my Acquaintance and talking of those things very earnestly three of them came to me the next Morning and told me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last Night and they came to make a secret Proposal to me and after enjoining me Secrecy they told me that they had a mind to fit out a Ship to go to  Guinea  that they had all Plantations as well as I and were straiten'd for nothing so much as Servants that as it was a Trade that could not be carried on because they could not publickly sell the  Negroes  when they came home so they desired to make but one Voyage to bring the  Negroes  on Shoar privately and divide them among their own Plantations and in a Word the Question was whether I would go their SuperCargo in the Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coast  of  Guinea  And they offer'd me that I should have my equal Share of the  Negroes  without providing any Part of the Stock  This was a fair Proposal it must be confess'd had it been made to any one that had not had a Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after which was in a fair way of coming to be very Considerable and with a good Stock upon it But for me that was thus entered and established and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three or four Years more and to have sent for the other hundred Pound from  England  and who in that time and with that little Addition could scarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thousand Pounds Sterling and that encreasing too for me to think of such a Voyage was the most prepostorous Thing that ever Man in such Circumstances could be guilty of  But I that was born to be my own Destroyer could no more resist the Offer than I could restrain my first rambling Designs when my Father's good Counsel was lost upon me In a word I told them I would go with all my Heart if they would undertake to look after my Plantation in my Absence and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarry'd This they all engag'd to do and entred into Writings or Covenants to do so and I made a formal Will disposing of my Plantation and Effects in Case of my Death making the Captain of the Ship that had sav'd my Life as before my universal Heir but obliging him to dispose of my Effects as I had directed in my Will one half of the Produce being to himself and the other to be ship'd to  England    In short I took all possible Caution to preserve my Effects and keep up my Plantation had I used half as much Prudence to have look'd into my  own Intrest and have made a Judgment of what I ought to have done and not to have done I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an Undertaking leaving all the probable Views of a thriving Circumstance and gone upon a Voyage to Sea attended with all its common Hazards to say nothing of the Reasons I had to expect particular Misfortunes to my self  But I was hurried on and obey'd blindly the Dictates of my Fancy rather than my Reason and accordingly the Ship being fitted out and the Cargo furnished and all things done as by Agreement by my Partners in the Voyage I went on Board in an evil Hour the  th of  being the same Day eight Year that I went from my Father and Mother at  Hull  in order to act the Rebel to their Authority and the Fool to my own Interest  Our Ship was about Tun Burthen carried Guns and Men besides the Master his Boy and my self we had on board no large Cargo of Goods except of such Toys as were fit for our Trade with the  Negroes  such as Beads bits of Glass Shells and odd Trifles especially little LookingGlasses Knives Scissars Hatchets and the like  The same Day I went on board we set sail standing away to the Northward upon our own Coast with Design to stretch over for the  Affrican  Coast when they came about or Degrees of Northern Latitude which it seems was the manner of their Course in those Days We had very good Weather only excessive hot all the way upon our own Coast till we came the Height of  Cape  St  Augustino  from whence keeping farther off at Sea we lost Sight of Land and steer'd as if we was bound for the Isle  Fernand de Noronha  holding  our Course  NE  by  N  and leaving those Isles on the East in this Course we past the Line in about Days time and were by our last Observation in Degrees Min Northern Latitude when a violent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out of our Knowledge it began from the SouthEast came about to the NorthWest and then settled into the NorthEast from whence it blew in such a terrible manner that for twelve Days together we could do nothing but drive and scudding away before it let it carry us whither ever Fate and the Fury of the Winds directed and during these twelve Days I need not say that I expected every Day to be swallowed up nor indeed did any in the Ship expect to save their Lives  In this Distress we had besides the Terror of the Storm one of our Men dyed of the Calenture and one Man and the Boy wash'd over board about the th Day the Weather abating a little the Master made an Observation as well as he could and found that he was in about Degrees North Latitude but that he was Degrees of Longitude difference West from  Cape  St  Augustino  so that he found he was gotten upon the Coast of  Guinea  or the North Part of  Brasil  beyond the River  Amozones  toward that of the River  Oronoque  commonly call'd the  Great River  and began to consult with me what Course he should take for the Ship was leaky and very much disabled and he was going directly back to the Coast of  Brasil    I was positively against that and looking over the Charts of the SeaCoast of  America  with him we concluded there was no inhabited Country for us to have recourse to till we came within the Circle of the  CarribleIslands  and therefore resolved to stand away for  Barbadoes  which by keeping off  at Sea to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph of  Mexico  we might easily perform as we hoped in about fifteen Days Sail whereas we could not possibly make our Voyage to the Coast of  Affrica  without some Assistance both to our Ship and to our selves  With this Design we chang'd our Course and steer'd away  N W  by  W  in order to reach some of our  English  Islands where I hoped for Relief but our Voyage was otherwise determined for being in the Latitude of Deg Min a second Storm came upon us which carry'd us away with the same Impetuosity Westward and drove us so out of the very Way of all humane Commerce that had all our Lives been saved as to the Sea we were rather in Danger of being devoured by Savages than ever returning to our own Country  In this Distress the Wind still blowing very hard one of our Men early in the Morning cry'd out  Land  and we had no sooner run out of the Cabbin to look out in hopes of seeing where abouts in the World we were but the Ship struck upon a Sand and in a moment her Motion being so stopp'd the Sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we should all have perish'd immediately and we were immediately driven into our close Quarters to shelter us from the very Foam and Sprye of the Sea  It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like Condition to describe or conceive the Consternation of Men in such Circumstances we knew nothing where we were or upon what Land it was we were driven whether an Island or the Main whether inhabited or not inhabited and as the Rage of the Wind was still great tho' rather less than at first we could not so much as  hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes without breaking in Pieces unless the Winds by a kind of Miracle should turn immediately about In a word we sat looking upon one another and expecting Death every Moment and every Man acting accordingly as preparing for another World for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this that which was our present Comfort and all the Comfort we had was that contrary to our Expectation the Ship did not break yet and that the Master said the Wind began to abate  Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little abate yet the Ship having thus struck upon the Sand and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off we were in a dreadful Condition indeed and had nothing to do but to think of saving our Lives as well as we could we had a Boat at our Stern just before the Storm but she was first stav'd by dashing against the Ship's Rudder and in the next Place she broke away and either sunk or was driven off to Sea so there was no hope from her we had another Boat on board but how to get her off into the Sea was a doubtful thing however there was no room to debate for we fancy'd the Ship would break in Pieces every Minute and some told us she was actually broken already  In this Distress the Mate of our Vessel lays hold of the Boat and with the help of the rest of the Men they got her slung over the Ship'sside and getting all into her let go and committed our selves being Eleven in Number to God's Mercy and the wild Sea for tho' the Storm was abated considerably yet the Sea went dreadful high upon the Shore and might well be call'd  Den wild Zee  as the  Dutch  call the Sea in a Storm  And now our Case was very dismal indeed for we all saw plainly that the Sea went so high that the Boat could not live and that we should be inevitably drowned As to making Sail we had none nor if we had could we ha' done any thing with it so we work'd at the Oar towards the Land tho' with heavy Hearts like Men going to Execution for we all knew that when the Boat came nearer the Shore she would be dash'd in a Thousand Pieces by the Breach of the Sea However we committed our Souls to God in the most earnest Manner and the Wind driving us towards the Shore we hasten'd our Destruction with our own Hands pulling as well as we could towards Land  What the Shore was whether Rock or Sand whether Steep or Shoal we knew not the only Hope that could rationally give us the least Shadow of Expectation was if we might happen into some Bay or Gulph or the Mouth of some River where by great Chance we might have run our Boat in or got under the Lee of the Land and perhaps made smooth Water But there was nothing of this appeared but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea  After we had row'd or rather driven about a League and a Half as we reckon'd it a raging Wave Mountainlike came rowling astern of us and plainly bad us expect the  Coup de Grace  In a word it took us with such a Fury that it overset the Boat at once and separating us as well from the Boat as from one another gave us not time hardly to say O God for we were all swallowed up in a Moment  Nothing can describe the Counfusion of Thought which I felt when I sunk into the Water for tho' I swam very well yet I could not deliver my self from the Waves so as to draw Breath till that Wave  having driven me or rather carried me a vast Way on towards the Shore and having spent it self went back and left me upon the Land almost dry but halfdead with the Water I took in I had so much Presence of Mind as well as Breath left that seeing my self nearer the main Land than I expected I got upon my Feet and endeavoured to make on towards the Land as fast as I could before another Wave should return and take me up again But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it for I saw the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill and as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or Strength to contend with my Business was to hold my Breath and raise my self upon the Water if I could and so by swimming to preserve my Breathing and Pilot my self towards the Shore if possible my greatest Concern now being that the Sea as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore when it came on might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the Sea  The Wave that came upon me again buried me at once or Foot deep in its own Body and I could feel my self carried with a mighty Force and Swiftness towards the Shore a very great Way but I held my Breath and assisted my self to swim still forward with all my Might I was ready to burst with holding my Breath when as I felt my self rising up so to my immediate Relief I found my Head and Hands shoot out above the Surface of the Water and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time that I could keep my self so yet it reliev'd me greatly gave me Breath and new Courage I was covered again with Water a good while but not so long but I held it out and finding the Water had spent it self and began to return I strook forward against the Return of the Waves and felt Ground again with my Feet I stood still a few  Moments to recover Breath and till the Water went from me and then took to my Heels and run with what Strength I had farther towards the Shore But neither would this deliver me from the Fury of the Sea which came pouring in after me again and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves and carried forwards as before the Shore being very flat  The last Time of these two had well near been fatal to me for the Sea having hurried me along as before landed me or rather dash'd me against a Piece of a Rock and that with such Force as it left me senseless and indeed helpless as to my own Deliverance for the Blow taking my Side and Breast beat the Breath as it were quite out of my Body and had it returned again immediately I must have been strangled in the Water but I recover'd a little before the return of the Waves and seeing I should be cover'd again with the Water I resolv'd to hold fast by a Piece of the Rock and so to hold my Breath if possible till the Wave went back now as the Waves were not so high as at first being nearer Land I held my Hold till the Wave abated and then fetch'd another Run which brought me so near the Shore that the next Wave tho' it went over me yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away and the next run I took I got to the main Land where to my great Comfort I clamber'd up the Clifts of the Shore and sat me down upon the Grass free from Danger and quite out of the Reach of the Water  I was now landed and safe on Shore and began to look up and thank God that my Life was sav'd in a Case wherein there was some Minutes before scarce any room to hope I believe it is impossible to express to the Life what the Extasies and Transports of  the Soul are when it is so sav'd as I may say out of the very Grave and I do not wonder now at that Custom  viz  That when a Malefactor who has the Halter about his Neck is tyed up and just going to be turn'd off and has a Reprieve brought to him I say I do not wonder that they bring a Surgeon with it to let him Blood that very Moment they tell him of it that the Surprise may not drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart and overwhelm him  For sudden Joys like Griefs confound at first  I walk'd about on the Shore lifting up my Hands and my whole Being as I may say wrapt up in the Contemplation of my Deliverance making a Thousand Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe reflecting upon all my Comerades that were drown'd and that there should not be one Soul sav'd but my self for as for them I never saw them afterwards or any Sign of them except three of their Hats one Cap and two Shoes that were not Fellows  I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel when the Breach and Froth of the Sea being so big I could hardly see it it lay so far off and considered Lord how was it possible I could get on Shore  After I had solac'd my Mind with the comfortable Part of my Condition I began to look round me to see what kind of Place I was in and what was next to be done and I soon found my Comforts abate and that in a word I had a dreadful Deliverance For I was wet had no Clothes to shift me nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me neither did I see any Prospect before me but that of perishing with Hunger or being devour'd by wild Beasts and that which was particularly afflicting to me was that I had no Weapon either to hunt  and kill any Creature for my Sustenance or to defend my self against any other Creature that might desire to kill me for theirs In a Word I had nothing about me but a Knife a Tobaccopipe and a little Tobacco in a Box this was all my Provision and this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind that for a while I run about like a Madman Night coming upon me I began with a heavy Heart to consider what would be my Lot if there were any ravenous Beasts in that Country seeing at Night they always come abroad for their Prey  All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at that Time was to get up into a thick bushy Tree like a Firr but thorny which grew near me and where I resolv'd to set all Night and consider the next Day what Dearh I should dye for as yet I saw no Prospect of Life I walk'd about a Furlong from the Shore to see if I could find any fresh Water to drink which I did to my great Joy and having drank and put a little Tobacco in my Mouth to prevent Hunger I went to the Tree and getting up into it endeavour'd to place my self so as that if I should sleep I might not fall and having cut me a short Stick like a Truncheon for my Defence I took up my Lodging and having been excessively fatigu'd I fell fast asleep and slept as comfortably as I believe few could have done in my Condition and found my self the most refresh'd with it that I think I ever was on such an Occasion  When I wak'd it was broad Day the Weather clear and the Storm abated so that the Sea did not rage and swell as before But that which surpris'd me most was that the Ship was lifted off in the Night from the Sand where she lay by the Swelling of the Tyde and was driven up almost as far as the Rock which I first mention'd  where I had been so bruis'd by the dashing me against it this being within about a Mile from the Shore where I was and the Ship seeming to stand upright still I wish'd my self on board that at least I might save some necessary things for my use  When I came down from my Appartment in the Tree I look'd about me again and the first thing I found was the Boat which lay as the Wind and the Sea had toss'd her up upon the Land about two Miles on my right Hand I walk'd as far as I could upon the Shore to have got to her but found a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the Boat which was about half a Mile broad so I came back for the present being more intent upon getting at the Ship where I hop'd to find something for my present Subsistence  A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm and the Tyde ebb'd so far out that I could come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship and here I found a fresh renewing of my Grief for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe that is to say we had all got safe on Shore and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all Comfort and Company as I now was this forc'd Tears from my Eyes again but as there was little Relief in that I resolv'd if possible to get to the Ship so I pull'd off my Clothes for the Weather was hot to Extremity and took the Water but when I came to the Ship my Difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board for as she lay a ground and high out of the Water there was nothing within my Reach to lay hold of I swam round her twice and the second Time I spy'd a small Piece of a Rope which I wonder'd I did not see at first hang down by the ForeChains so low  as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it and by the help of that Rope got up into the Forecastle of the Ship here I found that the Ship was bulg'd and had a great deal of Water in her Hold but that she lay so on the Side of a Bank of hard Sand or rather Earth that her Stern lay lifted up upon the Bank and her Head low almost to the Water by this Means all her Quarter was free and all that was in that Part was dry for you may be sure my first Work was to search and to see what was spoil'd and what was free and first I found that all the Ship's Provisions were dry and untouch'd by the Water and being very well dispos'd to eat I went to the Breadroom and fill'd my Pockets with Bisket and eat it as I went about other things for I had no time to lose I also found some Rum in the great Cabbin of which I took a large Dram and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me Now I wanted nothing but a Boat to furnish my self with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me  It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had and this Extremity rouz'd my Application we had several spare Yards and two or three large sparrs of Wood and a spare Topmast or two in the Ship I resolv'd to fall to work with these and I flung as many of them over board as I could manage for their Weight tying every one with a Rope that they might not drive away when this was done I went down the Ship's Side and pulling them to me I ty'd four of them fast together at both Ends as well as I could in the Form of a Raft and laying two or three short Pieces of Plank upon them crossways I found I could walk upon it very  well but that it was not able to bear any great Weight the Pieces being too light so I went to work and with the Carpenters Saw I cut a spare Topmast into three Lengths and added them to my Raft with a great deal of Labour and Pains but hope of furnishing my self with Necessaries encourag'd me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another Occasion  My Raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable Weight my next Care was what to load it with and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the Surf of the Sea But I was not long considering this I first laid all the Plank or Boards upon it that I could get and having consider'd well what I most wanted I first got three of the Seamens Chests which I had broken open and empty'd and lower'd them down upon my Raft the first of these I fill'd with Provision  viz  Bread Rice three Dutch Cheeses five Pieces of dry'd Goat's Flesh which we liv'd much upon and a little Remainder of  European  Corn which had been laid by for some Fowls which we brought to Sea with us but the Fowls were kill'd there had been some Barly and Wheat together but to my great Disappointment I found afterwards that the Rats had eaten or spoil'd it all as for Liquors I found several Cases of Bottles belonging to our Skipper in which were some Cordial Waters and in all about five or six Gallons of Rack these I stow'd by themselves there being no need to put them into the Chest nor no room for them While I was doing this I found the Tyde began to flow tho' very calm and I had the Mortification to see my Coat Shirt and Wastcoat which I had left on Shore upon the Sand swim away as for my Breeches which were only Linnen and open knee'd I swam on board in them and my Stockings However  this put me upon rummaging for Clothes of which I found enough but took no more than I wanted for present use for I had other things which my Eye was more upon as first Tools to work with on Shore and it was after long searching that I found out the Carpenter's Chest which was indeed a very useful Prize to me and much more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would have been at that time I got it down to my Raft even whole as it was without losing time to look into it for I knew in general what it contain'd  My next Care was for some Ammunition and Arms there were two very good Fowlingpieces in the great Cabbin and two Pistols these I secur'd first with some Powderhorns and a small Bag of Shot and two old rusty Swords I knew there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship but knew not where our Gunner had stow'd them but with much search I found them two of them dry and good the third had taken Water those two I got to my Raft with the Arms and now I thought my self pretty well freighted and began to think how I should get to Shore with them having neither Sail Oar or Rudder and the least Cap full of Wind would have overset all my Navigation  I had three Encouragements A smooth calm Sea The Tide rising and setting in to the Shore What little Wind there was blew me towards the Land and thus having found two or three broken Oars belong to the Boat and besides the Tools which were in the Chest I found two Saws an Axe and a Hammer and with this Cargo I put to Sea For a Mile or thereabouts my Raft went very well only that I found it drive a little distant from the Place where I had landed before by which I perceiv'd that there was some Indraft  of the Water and consequently I hop'd to find some Creek or River there which I might make use of as a Port to get to Land with my Cargo  As I imagin'd so it was there appear'd before me a little opening of the Land and I found a strong Current of the Tide set into it so I guided my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Middle of the Stream But here I had like to have suffer'd a second Shipwreck which if I had I think verily would have broke my Heart for knowing nothing of the Coast my Raft run aground at one End of it upon a Shoal and not being aground at the other End it wanted but a little that all my Cargo had slip'd off towards that End that was afloat and so fall'n into the Water I did my utmost by setting my Back against the Chests to keep them in their Places but could not thrust off the Raft with all my Strength neither durst I stir from the Posture I was in but holding up the Chests with all my Might stood in that Manner near half an Hour in which time the rising of the Water brought me a little more upon a Level and a little after the Water still rising my Raft floated again and I thrust her off with the Oar I had into the Channel and then driving up higher I at length found my self in the Mouth of a little River with Land on both Sides and a strong Current or Tide running up I look'd on both Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore for I was not willing to be driven too high up the River hoping in time to see some Ship at Sea and therefore resolv'd to place my self as near the Coast as I could  At length I spy'd a little Cove on the right Shore of the Creek to which with great Pain and Difficulty I guided my Raft and at last got so near  as that reaching Ground with my Oar I could thrust her directly in but here I had like to have dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again for that Shore lying pretty steep that is to say sloping there was no Place to land but where one End of my Float if it run on Shore would lie so high and the other sink lower as before that it would endanger my Cargo again All that I could do was to wait 'till the Tide was at highest keeping the Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side of it fast to the Shore near a flat Piece of Ground which I expected the Water would flow over and so it did As soon as I found Water enough for my Raft drew about a Foot Water I thrust her on upon that flat Piece of Ground and there fasten'd or mor'd her by sticking my two broken Oars into the Ground one on one Side near one End and one on the other Side near the other End and thus I lay 'till the Water ebb'd away and left my Raft and all my Cargoe safe on Shore  My next Work was to view the Country and seek a proper Place for my Habitation and where to stow my Goods to secure them from whatever might happen where I was I yet knew not whether on the Continent or on an Island whether inhabited or not inhabited whether in Danger of wild Beasts or not There was a Hill not above a Mile from me which rose up very steep and high and which seem'd to overtop some other Hills which lay as in a Ridge from it northward I took out one of the fowling Pieces and one of the Pistols and an Horn of Powder and thus arm'd I travell'd for Discovery up to the Top of that Hill where after I had with great Labour and Difficulty got to the Top I saw my Fate to my great Affliction  viz  that I was in an Island environ'd  every Way with the Sea no Land to be seen except some Rocks which lay a great Way off and two small Islands less than this which lay about three Leagues to the West  I found also that the Island I was in was barren and as I saw good Reason to believe uninhabited except by wild Beasts of whom however I saw none yet I saw Abundance of Fowls but knew not their Kinds neither when I kill'd them could I tell what was fit for Food and what not at my coming back I shot at a great Bird which I saw sitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood I believe it was the first Gun that had been fir'd there since the Creation of the World I had no sooner fir'd but from all the Parts of the Wood there arose an innumerable Number of Fowls of many Sorts making a confus'd Screaming and crying every one according to his usual Note but not one of them of any Kind that I knew As for the Creature I kill'd I took it to be a Kind of a Hawk its Colour and Beak resembling it but had no Talons or Claws more than common its Flesh was Carrion and fit for nothing  Contented with this Discovery I came back to my Raft and fell to Work to bring my Cargoe on Shore which took me up the rest of that Day and what to do with my self at Night I knew not nor indeed where to rest for I was afraid to lie down on the Ground not knowing but some wild Beast might devour me tho' as I afterwards found there was really no Need for those Fears  However as well as I could I barricado'd my self round with the Chests and Boards that I had brought on Shore and made a Kind of a Hut for that Night's Lodging as for Food I yet saw not which Way to supply my self except that I had  seen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of the Wood where I shot the Fowl  I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many Things out of the Ship which would be useful to me and particularly some of the Rigging and Sails and such other Things as might come to Land and I resolv'd to make another Voyage on Board the Vessel if possible and as I knew that the first Storm that blew must necessarily break her all in Pieces I resolv'd to set all other Things apart 'till I got every Thing out of the Ship that I could get then I call'd a Council that is to say in my Thoughts whether I should take back the Raft but this appear'd impracticable so I resolv'd to go as before when the Tide was down and I did so only that I stripp'd before I went from my Hut having nothing on but a Chequer'd Shirt and a Pair of Linnen Drawers and a Pair of Pumps on my Feet  I got on Board the Ship as before and prepar'd a second Raft and having had Experience of the first I neither made this so unweildy nor loaded it so hard but yet I brought away several Things very useful to me as first in the Carpenter's Stores I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes a great SkrewJack a Dozen or two of Hatchets and above all that most useful Thing call'd a Grindstone all these I secur'd together with several Things belonging to the Gunner particularly two or three Iron Crows and two Barrels of Musquet Bullets seven Musquets and another fowling Piece with some small Quantity of Powder more a large Bag full of small Shot and a great Roll of Sheet Lead But this last was so heavy I could not hoise it up to get it over the Ship's Side  Besides these Things I took all the Mens Cloths that I could find and a spare Foretopsail a Hammock  and some Bedding and with this I loaded my second Raft and brought them all safe on Shore to my very great Comfort  I was under some Apprehensions during my Absence from the Land that at least my Provisions might be devour'd on Shore but when I came back I found no Sign of any Visitor only there sat a Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chests which when I came towards it ran away a little Distance and then stood still she sat very compos'd and unconcern'd and look'd full in my Face as if she had a Mind to be acquainted with me I presented my Gun at her but as she did not understand it she was perfectly unconcern'd at it nor did she offer to stir away upon which I toss'd her a Bit of Bisket tho' by the Way I was not very free of it for my Store was not great However I spar'd her a Bit I say and she went to it smell'd of it and ate it and look'd as pleas'd for more but I thank'd her and could spare no more so she march'd off  Having got my second Cargoe on Shore tho' I was fain to open the Barrels of Powder and bring them by Parcels for they were too heavy being large Casks I went to work to make me a little Tent with the Sail and some Poles which I cut for that Purpose and into this Tent I brought every Thing that I knew would spoil either with Rain or Sun and I piled all the empty Chests and Casks up in a Circle round the Tent to fortify it from any sudden Attempt either from Man or Beast  When I had done this I block'd up the Door of the Tent with some Boards within and an empty Chest set up an End without and spreading one of the Beds upon the Ground laying my two Pistols just at my Head and my Gun at Length by me I went to Bed for the first Time and slept  very quietly all Night for I was very weary and heavy for the Night before I had slept little and had labour'd very hard all Day as well to fetch all those Things from the Ship as to get them on Shore  I had the biggest Maggazin of all Kinds now that ever were laid up I believe for one Man but I was not satisfy'd still for while the Ship sat upright in that Posture I thought I ought to get every Thing out of her that I could so every Day at low Water I went on Board and brought away some Thing or other But particularly the third Time I went I brought away as much of the Rigging as I could as also all the small Ropes and Ropetwine I could get with a Piece of spare Canvass which was to mend the Sails upon Occasion the Barrel of wet Gunpowder In a Word I brought away all the Sails first and last only that I was fain to cut them in Pieces and bring as much at a Time as I could for they were no more useful to be Sails but as meer Canvass only  But that which comforted me more still was that at last of all after I had made five or six such Voyages as these and thought I had nothing more to expect from the Ship that was worth my medling with I say after all this I found a great Hogshead of Bread and three large Runlets of Rum or Spirits and a Box of Sugar and a Barrel of fine Flower this was surprizing to me because I had given over expecting any more Provisions except what was spoil'd by the Water I soon empty'd the Hogshead of that Bread and wrapt it up Parcel by Parcel in Pieces of the Sails which I cut out and in a Word I got all this safe on Shore also  The next Day I made another Voyage and now having plunder'd the Ship of what was portable  and fit to hand out I began with the Cables and cutting the great Cable into Pieces such as I could move I got two Cables and a Hawser on Shore with all the Iron Work I could get and having cut down the Spritsailyard and the Missenyard and every Thing I could to make a large Raft I loaded it with all those heavy Goods and came away But my good Luck began now to leave me for this Raft was so unweildy and so overloaden that after I was enter'd the little Cove where I had landed the rest of my Goods not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other it overset and threw me and all my Cargoe into the Water as for my self it was no great Harm for I was near the Shore but as to my Cargoe it was great Part of it lost especially the Iron which I expected would have been of great Use to me However when the Tide was out I got most of the Pieces of Cable ashore and some of the Iron tho' with infinite Labour for I was fain to dip for it into the Water a Work which fatigu'd me very much After this I went every Day on Board and brought away what I could get  I had been now thirteen Days on Shore and had been eleven Times on Board the Ship in which Time I had brought away all that one Pair of Hands could well be suppos'd capable to bring tho' I believe verily had the calm Weather held I should have brought away the whole Ship Piece by Piece But preparing the th Time to go on Board I found the Wind begin to rise however at low Water I went on Board and tho' I thought I had rumag'd the Cabbin so effectually as that nothing more could be found yet I discover'd a Locker with Drawers in it in one of which I found two or three Razors and one Pair of large Sizzers with some ten or a Dozen of good Knives and  Forks in another I found about Thirty six Pounds value in Money some  European  Coin some  Brasil  some Pieces of Eight some Gold some Silver  I smil'd to my self at the Sight of this Money O Drug Said I aloud what art thou good for Thou art not worth to me no not the taking off of the Ground one of those Knives is worth all this Heap I have no Manner of use for thee e'en remain where thou art and go to the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth saving However upon Second Thoughts I took it away and wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas I began to think of making another Raft but while I was preparing this I found the Sky overcast and the Wind began to rise and in a Quarter of an Hour it blew a fresh Gale from the Shore it presently occur'd to me that it was in vain to pretend to make a Raft with the Wind off Shore and that it was my Business to be gone before the Tide of Flood began otherwise I might not be able to reach the Shore at all Accordingly I let my self down into the Water and swam cross the Channel which lay between the Ship and the Sands and even that with Difficulty enough partly with the Weight of the Things I had about me and partly the Roughness of the Water for the Wind rose very hastily and before it was quite high Water it blew a Storm  But I was gotten home to my little Tent where I lay with all my Wealth about me very secure It blew very hard all that Night and in the Morning when I look'd out behold no more Ship was to be seen I was a little surpriz'd but recover'd my self with this satisfactory Reflection  viz  That I had lost no time nor abated no Dilligence to get every thing out of her that could be useful to me and that indeed there was little left in her that I  was able to bring away if I had had more time  I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship or of any thing out of her except what might drive on Shore from her Wreck as indeed divers Pieces of her afterwards did but those things were of small use to me  My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about securing my self against either Savages if any should appear or wild Beasts if any were in the Island and I had many Thoughts of the Method how to do this and what kind of Dwelling to make whether I should make me a Cave in the Earth or a Tent upon the Earth And in short I resolv'd upon both the Manner and Discription of which it may not be improper to give an Account of  I sooon found the Place I was in was not for my Settlement particularly because it was upon a low moorish Ground near the Sea and I believ'd would not be wholsome and more particularly because there was no fresh Water near it so I resolv'd to find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of Ground  I consulted several Things in my Situation which I found would be proper for me st Health and fresh Water I just now mention'd dly Shelter from the Heat of the Sun dly Security from ravenous Creatures whether Men or Beasts thly a View to the Sea that if God sent any Ship in Sight I might not lose any Advantage for my Deliverance of which I was not willing to banish all my Expectation yet  In search of a Place proper for this I found a little Plain on the Side of a rising Hill whose Front towards this little Plain was steep as a Houseside so that nothing could come down upon me from the Top on the Side of this Rock  there was a hollow Place worn a little way in like the Entrance or Door of a Cave but there was not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all  On the Flat of the Green just before this hollow Place I resolv'd to pitch my Tent This Plain was not above an Hundred Yards broad and about twice as long and lay like a Green before my Door and at the End of it descended irregularly every Way down into the Lowgrounds by the Seaside It was on the  N N W  Side of the Hill so that I was shelter'd from the Heat every Day till it came to a  W  and by  S  Sun or thereabouts which in those Countries is near the Setting  Before I set up my Tent I drew a half Circle before the hollow Place which took in about Ten Yards in its Semidiameter from the Rock and Twenty Yards in its Diameter from its Beginning and Ending  In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of strong Stakes driving them into the Ground till they stood very firm like Piles the biggest End being out of the Ground about Five Foot and a Half and sharpen'd on the Top The two Rows did not stand above Six Inches from one another  Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the Ship and I laid them in Rows one upon another within the Circle between these two Rows of Stakes up to the Top placing other Stakes in the Inside leaning against them about two Foot and a half high like a Spurr to a Post and this Fence was so strong that neither Man or Beast could get into it or over it This cost me a great deal of Time and Labour especially to cut the Piles in the Woods bring them to the Place and drive them into the Earth  The Entrance into this Place I made to be not by a Door but by a short Ladder to go over  the Top which Ladder when I was in I lifted over after me and so I was compleatly fenc'd in and fortify'd as I thought from all the World and consequently slept secure in the Night which otherwise I could not have done tho' as it appear'd afterward there was no need of all this Caution from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from  Into this Fence or Fortress with infinite Labour I carry'd all my Riches all my Provisions Ammunition and Stores of which you have the Account above and I made me a large Tent which to preserve me from the Rains that in one Part of the Year are very violent there I made double  viz  One smaller Tent within and one larger Tent above it and cover'd the uppermost with a large Tarpaulin which I had sav'd among the Sails  And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought on Shore but in a Hammock which was indeed a very good one and belong'd to the Mate of the Ship  Into this Tent I brought all my Provisions and every thing that would spoil by the Wet and having thus enclos'd all my Goods I made up the Entrance which till now I had left open and so pass'd and repass'd as I said by a short Ladder  When I had done this I began to work my Way into the Rock and bringing all the Earth and Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent I laid 'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a Terras that so it rais'd the Ground within about a Foot and a Half and thus I made me a Cave just behind my Tent which serv'd me like a Cellar to my House  It cost me much Labour and many Days before all these Things were brought to Perfection and therefore I must go back to some other Things which took up some of my Thoughts At the same time it  happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the setting up my Tent and making the Cave that a Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud a sudden Flash of Lightning happen'd and after that a great Clap of Thunder as is naturally the Effect of it I was not so much surpris'd with the Lightning as I was with a Thought which darted into my Mind as swift as the Lightning it self O my Powder My very Heart sunk within me when I thought that at one Blast all my Powder might be destroy'd on which not my Defence only but the providing me Food as I thought entirely depended I was nothing near so anxious about my own Danger tho' had the Powder took fire I had never known who had hurt me  Such Impression did this make upon me that after the Storm was over I laid aside all my Works my Building and Fortifying and apply'd my self to make Bags and Boxes to separate the Powder and keep it a little and a little in a Parcel in hope that whatever might come it might not all take Fire at once and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another I finish'd this Work in about a Fort night and I think my Powder which in all was about l weight was divided in not less than a Hundred Parcels as to the Barrel that had been wet I did not apprehend any Danger from that so I plac'd it in my new Cave which in my Fancy I call'd my Kitchin and the rest I hid up and down in Holes among the Rocks so that no wet might come to it marking very carefully where I laid it  In the Interval of time while this was doing I went out once at least every Day with my Gun as well to divert my self as to see if I could kill any thing fit for Food and as near as I could to acquaint  my self with what the Island produc'd The first time I went out I presently discover'd that there were Goats in the Island which was a great Satisfaction to me but then it was attended with this Misfortune to me  viz  That they were so shy so subtile and so swift of Foot that it was the difficultest thing in the World to come at them But I was not discourag'd at this not doubting but I might now and then shoot one as it soon happen'd for after I had found their Haunts a little I laid wait in this Manner for them I observ'd if they saw me in the Valleys tho' they were upon the Rocks they would run away as in a terrible Fright but if they were feeding in the Valleys and I was upon the Rocks they took no Notice of me from whence I concluded that by the Position of their Opticks their Sight was so directed downward that they did not readily see Objects that were above them so afterward I took this Method I always clim'd the Rocks first to get above them and then had frequently a fair Mark The first shot I made among these Creatures I kill'd a SheGoat which had a little Kid by her which she gave Suck to which griev'd me heartily but when the Old one fell the Kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her up and not only so but when I carry'd the Old one with me upon my Shoulders the Kid follow'd me quite to my Enclosure upon which I laid down the Dam and took the Kid in my Arms and carry'd it over my Pale in hopes to have bred it up tame but it would not eat so I was forc'd to kill it and eat it my self these two supply'd me with Flesh a great while for I eat sparingly and sav'd my Provisions my Bread especially as much as possibly I could  Having now fix'd my Habitation I found it absolutely necessary to provide a Place to make a Fire in and Fewel to burn and what I did for that as also how I enlarg'd my Cave and what Conveniencies I made I shall give a full Account of in its Place But I must first give some little Account of my self and of my Thoughts about Living which it may well be suppos'd were not a few  I had a dismal Prospect of my Condition for as I was not cast away upon that Island without being driven as is said by a violent Storm quite out of the Course of our intended Voyage and a great Way  viz  some Hundreds of Leagues out of the ordinary Course of the Trade of Mankind I had great Reason to consider it as a Determination of Heaven that in this desolate Place and in this desolate Manner I should end my Life the Tears would run plentifully down my Face when I made these Reflections and sometimes I would expostulate with my self Why Providence should thus compleatly ruine its Creatures and render them so absolutely miserable so without Help abandon'd so entirely depress'd that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a Life  But something always return'd swift upon me to check these Thoughts and to reprove me and particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my Hand by the Seaside I was very pensive upon the Subject of my present Condition when Reason as it were expostulated with me t'other Way thus Well you are in a desolate Condition 'tis true but pray remember Where are the rest of you Did not you come Eleven of you into the Boat where are the Ten Why were not they sav'd and you lost Why were you singled out Is it better to be here or there and then I pointed to the Sea All  Evills are to be consider'd with the Good that is in them and with what worse attends them  Then it occurr'd to me again how well I was furnish'd for my Subsistence and what would have been my Case if it had not happen'd  Which was an Hundred Thousand to one  that the Ship floated from the Place where she first struck and was driven so near to the Shore that I had time to get all these Things out of her What would have been my Case if I had been to have liv'd in the Condition in which I at first came on Shore without Necessaries of Life or Necessaries to supply and procure them Particularly said I aloud tho' to my self what should I ha' done without a Gun without Ammunition without any Tools to make any thing or to work with without Clothes Bedding a Tent or any manner of Covering and that now I had all these to a Sufficient Quantity and was in a fair way to provide my self in such a manner as to live without my Gun when my Ammunition was spent so that I had a tollerable View of subsisting without any Want as long as I liv'd for I consider'd from the beginning how I would provide for the Accidents that might happen and for the time that was to come even not only after my Ammunition should be spent but even after my Health or Strength should decay  I confess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my Ammunition being destroy'd at one Blast I mean my Powder being blown up by Lightning and this made the Thoughts of it so surprising to me when it lighten'd and thunder'd as I observ'd just now  And now being to enter into a melancholy Relation of a Scene of silent Life such perhaps as was never heard of in the World before I shall take it from its Beginning and continue it in its  Order It was by my Account the th of  Sept  when in the Manner as above said I first set Foot upon this horrid Island when the Sun being to us in its Autumnal Equinox was almost just over my Head for I reckon'd my self by Observation to be in the Latitude of Degrees Minutes North of the Line  After I had been there about Ten or Twelve Days it came into my Thoughts that I should lose my Reckoning of Time for want of Books and Pen and Ink and should even forget the Sabbath Days from the working Days but to prevent this I cut it with my Knife upon a large Post in Captital Letters and making it into a great Cross I set it up on the Shore where I first landed viz  I came on Shore here on the    th of  Sept Upon the Sides of this square Post I cut every Day a Notch with my Knife and every seventh Notch was as long again as the rest and every first Day of the Month as long again as that long one and thus I kept my Kalander or weekly monthly and yearly reckoning of Time  In the next place we are to observe that among the many things which I brought out of the Ship in the several Voyages which as above mention'd I made to it I got several things of less Value but not all less useful to me which I omitted setting down before as in particular Pens Ink and Paper several Parcels in the Captain's Mate's Gunner's and Carpenter's keeping three or four Compasses some Mathematical Instruments Dials Perspectives Charts and Books of Navigation all which I huddel'd together whether I might want them or no also I found three very good Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from  England  and which I had pack'd up among my things some  Portugueze  Books also and among them two  or three Popish PrayerBooks and several other Books all which I carefully secur'd And I must not forget that we had in the Ship a Dog and two Cats of whose eminent History I may have occasion to say something in its place for I carry'd both the Cats with me and as for the Dog he jump'd out of the Ship of himself and swam on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with my first Cargo and was a trusty Servant to me many Years I wanted nothing that he could fetch me nor any Company that he could make up to me I only wanted to have him talk to me but that would not do As I observ'd before I found Pen Ink and Paper and I husbanded them to the utmost and I shall shew that while my Ink lasted I kept things very exact but after that was gone I could not for I could not make any Ink by any Means that I could devise  And this put me in mind that I wanted many things notwithstanding all that I had amass'd together and of these this of Ink was one as also Spade PickAxe and Shovel to dig or remove the Earth Needles Pins and Thread as for Linnen I soon learn'd to want that without much Difficulty  This want of Tools made every Work I did go on heavily and it was near a whole Year before I had entirely finish'd my little Pale or surrounded Habitation The Piles or Stakes which were as heavy as I could well lift were a long time in cutting and preparing in the Woods and more by far in bringing home so that I spent some times two Days in cuttting and bringing home one of those Posts and a third Day in driving it into the Ground for which Purpose I got a heavy Piece of Wood at first but at last bethought my self of one of the Iron Crows which however tho' I found it yet  it made driving those Posts or Piles very laborious and tedious Work  But what need I ha' been concern'd at the Tediousness of any thing I had to do seeing I had time enough to do it in nor had I any other Employment if that had been over at least that I could foresee except the ranging the Island to seek for Food which I did more or less every Day  I now began to consider seriously my Condition and the Circumstance I was reduc'd to and I drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me for I was like to have but few Heirs as to deliver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them and afflicting my Mind and as my Reason began now to master my Despondency I began to comfort my self as well as I could and to set the good against the Evil that I might have something to distinguish my Case from worse and I stated it very impartially like Debtor and Creditor the Comforts I enjoy'd against the Miseries I suffer'd Thus  Evil  I am cast upon a horrible desolate Island void of all hope of Recovery  I am singl'd out and separated as it were from all the World to be miserable  I am divided from Mankind a Solitaire one banish'd from humane Society  I have not Clothes to cover me  I am without any Defence or Means to resist any Violence of Man or Beast  I have no Soul to speak to or relieve me  Good  But I am alive and not drown'd as all my Ship's Company was  But I am singl'd out too from all the Ship's Crew to be spar'd from Death and he that miraculously sav'd me from Death can deliver me from this Condition  But I am not starv'd and perishing on a barren Place affording no Sustenance  But I am in a hot Climate where if I had Clothes I could hardly wear them  But I am cast on an Island where I see no wild Beasts to hurt me as I saw on the Coast of  Africa  And what if I had been Shipwreck'd there  But God wonderfully sent the Ship in near enough to the Shore that I have gotten out so many necessary things as will either supply my Wants or enable me to supply my self even as long as I live  Upon the whole here was an undoubted Testimony that there was scarce any Condition in the World so miserable but there was something  Negativ  or something  Positiv  to be thankful for in it and let this stand as a Direction from the Experience of the most miserable of all Conditions in this World that we may always find in it something to comfort our selves from and to set in the Description of Good and Evil on the Credit Side of the Accompt  Having now brought my Mind a little to relish my Condition and given over looking out to Sea to see if I could spy a Ship I say giving over these things I began to apply my self to accommodate my way of Living and to make things as easy to me as I could  I have already describ'd my Habitation which was a Tent under the Side of a Rock surrounded with a strong Pale of Posts and Cables but I might now rather call it a Wall for I rais'd a kind of Wall up against it of Turfs about two Foot thick on the Outside and after some time I think it was a Year and Half I rais'd Rafters from it leaning to the Rock and thatch'd or cover'd it with Bows of Trees and such things as I could get to keep out the Rain which I found at some times of the Year very violent  I have already observ'd how I broughr all my Goods into this Pale and into the Cave which I had made behind me But I must observe too that at first this was a confus'd Heap of Goods which as they lay in no Order so they took up all my Place I had no room to turn my self so I set my self to enlarge my Cave and Works farther into the Earth for it was a loose sandy Rock which yielded easily to the Labour I bestow'd on it and so when I found I was pretty safe as to Beasts of Prey I work'd sideways to the Right Hand into the Rock and then turning to the Right again work'd quite out and made me a Door to come out on the Outside of my Pale or Fortification  This gave me not only Egress and Regress as it were a back Way to my Tent and to my Storehouse but gave me room to stow my Goods  And now I began to apply my self to make such necessary things as I found I most wanted as particularly a Chair and a Table for without these I was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the World I could not write or eat or do several things with so much Pleasure without a Table  So I went to work and here I must needs observe that as Reason is the Substance and Original  of the Mathematicks so by stating and squaring every thing by Reason and by making the most rational Judgment of things every Man may be in time Master of every mechanick Art I had never handled a Tool in my Life and yet in time by Labour Application and Contrivance I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it especially if I had had Tools however I made abundance of things even without Tools and some with no more Tools than an Adze and a Hatchet which perhaps were never made that way before and that with infinite Labour For Example If I wanted a Board I had no other Way but to cut down a Tree set it on an Edge before me and hew it flat on either Side with my Axe till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank and then dubb it smooth with my Adze It is true by this Method I could make but one Board out of a whole Tree but this I had no Remedy for but Patience any more than I had for the prodigious deal of Time and Labour which it took me up to make a Plank or Board But my Time or Labour was little worth and so it was as well employ'd one way as another  However I made me a Table and a Chair as I observ'd above in the first Place and this I did out of the short Pieces of Boards that I brought on my Raft from the Ship But when I had wrought out some Boards as above I made large Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and Half one over another all along one Side of my Cave to lay all my Tools Nails and Ironwork and in a Word to separate every thing at large in their Places that I might come easily at them I knock'd Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns and all things that would hang up  So that had my Cave been to be seen it look'd like a general Magazine of all Necessary things and I had every thing so ready at my Hand that it was a grear Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in such Order and especially to find my Stock of all Necessaries so great  And now it was when I began to keep a Journal of every Days Employment for indeed at first I was in too much Hurry and not only Hurry as to Labour but in too much Discomposure of Mind and my Journal would ha' been full of many dull things For Example I must have said thus  Sept  the th After I got to Shore and had escap'd drowning instead of being thankful to God for my Deliverance having first vomited with the great Quantity of salt Water which was gotten into my Stomach and recovering my self a little I ran about the Shore wringing my Hands and beating my Head and Face exclaiming at my Misery and crying out I was undone undone till tyr'd and faint I was forc'd to lye down on the Ground to repose but durst not sleep for fear of being devour'd  Some Days after this and after I had been on board the Ship and got all that I could out of her yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in hopes of seeing a Ship then fancy at a vast Distance I spy'd a Sail please my self with the Hopes of it and then after looking steadily till I was almost blind lose it quite and sit down and weep like a Child and thus encrease my Misery by my Folly  But having gotten over these things in some Measure and having settled my houshold Stuff and Habitation made me a Table and a Chair and all as handsome about me as I could I began to keep  my Journal of which I shall here give you the Copy tho' in it will be told all these Particulars over again as long as it lasted for having no more Ink I was forc'd to leave it off  The  JOURNAL    SEptember  I poor miserable  Robinson Crusoe  being shipwreck'd during a dreadful Storm in the offing came on Shore on this dismal unfortunate Island which I call'd  the Island of Despair  all the rest of the Ship's Company being drown'd and my self almost dead  All the rest of that Day I spent in afflicting my self at the dismal Circumstances I was brought to  viz  I had neither Food House Clothes Weapon or Place to fly to and in Despair of any Relief saw nothing but Death before me either that I should be devour'd by wild Beasts murther'd by Savages or starv'd to Death for Want of Food At the Approach of Night I slept in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures but slept soundly tho' it rain'd all Night  October  In the Morning I saw to my great Surprise the Ship had floated with the high Tide and was driven on Shore again much nearer the Island which as it was some Comfort on one hand for seeing her sit upright and not broken to Pieces I hop'd▪ if the Wind abated I might get on board and get some Food and Necessaries out of her for my Relief so on the other hand it renew'd my Grief at the Loss of my Comrades who I imagin'd if we had all staid on board might have sav'd the Ship or at least that they would not have been all drown'd as they were and that had the Men been sav'd we might perhaps have built us a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship to have carried  us to some other Part of the World I spent great Part of this Day in perplexing my self on these things but at length seeing the Ship almost dry I went upon the Sand as near as I could and then swam on board this Day also it continu'd raining tho' with no Wind at all  From the st of  October  to the th All these Days entirely spent in many several Voyages to get all I could out of the Ship which I brought on Shore every Tide of Flood upon Rafts Much Rain also in these Days tho' with some Intervals of fair Weather But it seems this was the rainy Season  Oct  I overset my Raft and all the Goods I had got upon it but being in shoal Water and the things being chiefly heavy I recover'd many of them when the Tide was out  Oct  It rain'd all Night and all Day with some Gusts of Wind during which time the Ship broke in Pieces the Wind blowing a little harder than before and was no more to be seen except the Wreck of her and that only at low Water I spent this Day in covering and securing the Goods which I had sav'd that the Rain might not spoil them  Oct  I walk'd about the Shore almost all Day to find out a place to fix my Habitation greatly concern'd to secure my self from an Attack in the Night either from wild Beasts or Men Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under a Rock and mark'd out a SemiCircle for my Encampment which I resolv'd to strengthen with a Work Wall or Fortification made of double Piles lin'd within with Cables and without with Turf  From the th to the th I work'd very hard in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation  tho' some Part of the time it rain'd exceeding hard  The st in the Morning I went out into the Island with my Gun to see for some Food and discover the Country when I kill'd a SheGoat and her Kid follow'd me home which I afterwards kill'd also because it would not feed  November  I set up my Tent under a Rock and lay there for the first Night making it as large as I could with Stakes driven in to swing my Hammock upon  Nov  I set up all my Chests and Boards and the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts and with them form'd a Fence round me a little within the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortification  Nov  I went out with my Gun and kill'd two Fowls like Ducks which were very good Food In the Afternoon went to work to make me a Table  Nov  This Morning I began to order my times of Work of going out with my Gun time of Sleep and time of Diversion  viz  Every Morning I walk'd out with my Gun for two or three Hours if it did not rain then employ'd my self to work till about Eleven aClock then eat what I had to live on and from Twelve to Two I lay down to sleep the Weather being excessive hot and then in the Evening to work again The working Part of this Day and of the next were wholly employ'd in making my Table for I was yet but a very sorry Workman tho' Time and Necessity made me a compleat natural Mechanick soon after as I believe it would do any one else  Nov  This Day went abroad with my Gun and my Dog and kill'd a wild Cat her Skin pretty soft but her Flesh good for nothing Every  Creature I kill'd I took off the Skins and preserv'd them Coming back by the Sea Shore I saw many Sorts of Sea Fowls which I did not understand but was surpris'd and almost frighted with two or three Seals which while I was gazing at not well knowing what they were got into the Sea and escap'd me for that time  Nov  After my Morning Walk I went to work with my Table again and finish'd it tho' not to my liking nor was it long before I learn'd to mend it  Nov  Now it began to be settled fair Weather The th th th th and Part of the th for the th was Sunday I took wholly up to make me a Chair and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape but never to please me and even in the making I pull'd it in Pieces several times  Note  I soon neglected my keeping Sundays for omitting my Mark for them on my Post I forgot which was which  Nov  This Day it rain'd which refresh'd me exceedingly and cool'd the Earth but it was accompany'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Powder as soon as it was over I resolv'd to separate my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as possible that it might not be in Danger  Nov  These three Days I spent in making little square Chests or Boxes which might hold about a Pound or two Pound at most of Powder and so putting the Powder in I stow'd it in Places as secure and remote from one another as possible On one of these three Days I kill'd a large Bird that was good to eat but I know not what to call it  Nov  This Day I began to dig behind my Tent into the Rock to make room for my farther  Conveniency  Note  Two Things I wanted exceedingly for this Work  viz  A Pickaxe a Shovel and a Wheelbarrow or Basket so I desisted from my Work and began to consider how to supply that Want and make me some Tools as for a Pickaxe I made use of the Iron Crows which were proper enough tho' heavy but the next thing was a Shovel or Spade this was so absolutely necessary that indeed I could do nothing effectually without it but what kind of one to make I knew not  Nov  The next Day in searching the Woods I found a Tree of that Wood or like it which in the  Brasils  they call the  Iron Tree  for its exceeding Hardness of this with great Labour and almost spoiling my Axe I cut a Piece and brought it home too with Difficulty enough for it was exceeding heavy  The excessive Hardness of the Wood and having no other Way made me a long while upon this Machine for I work'd it effectually by little and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade the Handle exactly shap'd like ours in  England  only that the broad Part having no Iron shod upon it at Bottom it would not l  t me so long however it serv'd well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to but never was a Shovel I believe made after that Fashion or so long a making  I was still deficient for I wanted a Basket or a Wheelbarrow a Basket I could not make by any Means having no such things as Twigs that would bend to make Wicker Ware at least none yet found out and as to a Wheelbarrow I fancy'd I could make all but the Wheel but that I had no Notion of neither did I know how to go about it besides I had no possible Way to make the Iron Gudgeons  for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in so I gave it over and so for carrying away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave I made me a Thing like a Hodd which the Labourers carry Morter in when they serve the Bricklayers  This was not so difficult to me as the making the Shovel and yet this and the Shovel and the Attempt which I made in vain to make a WheelBarrow took me up no less than four Days I mean always excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun which I seldom fail'd and very seldom fail'd also bringing Home something fit to eat  Nov  My other Work having now stood still because of my making these Tools when they were finish'd I went on and working every Day as my Strength and Time allow'd I spent eighteen Days entirely in widening and deepening my Cave that it might hold my Goods commodiously  Note  During all this Time I work'd to make this Room or Cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a Warehouse or Magazin a Kitchen a Diningroom and a Cellar as for my Lodging I kept to the Tent except that some Times in the wet Season of the Year it rain'd so hard that I could not keep my self dry which caused me afterwards to cover all my Place within my Pale with long Poles in the Form of Rafters leaning against the Rock and load them with Flaggs and large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch  December  th I began now to think my Cave or Vault finished when on a Sudden it seems I had made it too large a great Quantity of Earth fell down from the Top and one Side so much that in short it frighted me and not without Reason too for if I had been under it I had never wanted a GraveDigger Upon this Disaster I had  a great deal of Work to do over again for I had the loose Earth to carry out and which was of more Importance I had the Seiling to prop up so that I might be sure no more would come down  Dec  This Day I went to Work with it accordingly and got two Shores or Posts pitch'd upright to the Top with two Pieces of Boards across over each Post this I finish'd the next Day and setting more Posts up with Boards in about a Week more I had the Roof secur'd and the Posts standing in Rows serv'd me for Partitions to part of my House  Dec  From this Day to the Twentieth I plac'd Shelves and knock'd up Nails on the Posts to hang every Thing up that could be hung up and now I began to be in some Order within Doors  Dec  Now I carry'd every Thing into the Cave and began to furnish my House and set up some Pieces of Boards like a Dresser to order my Victuals upon but Boards began to be very scarce with me also I made me another Table  Dec  Much Rain all Night and all Day no stirring out  Dec  Rain all Day  Dec  No Rain and the Earth much cooler than before and pleasanter  Dec  Kill'd a young Goat and lam'd another so as that I catch'd it and led it Home in a String when I had it Home I bound and splinter'd up its Leg which was broke  N B  I took such Care of it that it liv'd and the Leg grew well and as strong as ever but by my nursing it so long it grew tame and fed upon the little Green at my Door and would not go away This was the first Time that I entertain'd a Thought of breeding up some tame Creatures  that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot was all spent  Dec  Great Heats and no Breeze so that there was no Stirring abroad except in the Evening for Food this Time I spent in putting all my Things in Order within Doors  January  Very hot still but I went abroad early and late with my Gun and lay still in the Middle of the Day this Evening going farther into the Valleys which lay towards the Center of the Island I found there was plenty of Goats tho' exceeding shy and hard to come at however I resolv'd to try if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down  Jan  Accordingly the next Day I went out with my Dog and set him upon the Goats but I was mistaken for they all fac'd about upon the Dog and he knew his Danger too well for he would not come near them  Jan  I began my Fence or Wall which being still jealous of my being attack'd by some Body I resolv'd to make very thick and strong  N B  This Wall being describ'd before I purposely omit what was said in the Journal it is sufficient to observe that I was no less Time than from the    d of  January  to the    th of  April  working finishing and perfecting this Wall tho' it was no more than about    Yards in Length being a half Circle from one Place in the Rock to another Place about eight Yards from it the Door of the Cave being in the Center behind it  All this Time I work'd very hard the Rains hindering me many Days nay sometimes Weeks together but I thought I should never be perfectly secure 'till this Wall was finish'd and it is  scarce credible what inexpressible Labour every Thing was done with especially the bringing Piles out of the Woods and driving them into the Ground for I made them much bigger than I need to have done  When this Wall was finished and the Outside double fenc'd with a TurffWall rais'd up close to it I perswaded my self that if any People were to come on Shore there they would not perceive any Thing like a Habitation and it was very well I did so as may be observ'd hereafter upon a very remarkable Occasion  During this Time I made my Rounds in the Woods for Game every Day when the Rain admitted me and made frequent Discoveries in these Walks of something or other to my Advantage particularly I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons who built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree but rather as House Pidgeons in the Holes of the Rocks and taking some young ones I endeavoured to bread them up tame and did so but when they grew older they flew all away which perhaps was at first for Want of feeding them for I had nothing to give them however I frequently found their Nests and got their young ones which were very good Meat  And now in the managing my houshold Affairs I found my self wanting in many Things which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make as indeed as to some of them it was  for Instance  I could never make a Cask to be hooped I had a small Runlet or two  as I observed before  but I cou'd never arrive to the Capacity of making one by them tho' I spent many Weeks about it I could neither put in the Heads or joint the Staves so true to one another as to make them hold Water so I gave that also over  In the next Place I was at a great Loss for Candle so that as soon as ever it was dark which was generally by SevenaClock I was oblig'd to go to Bed I remembred the Lump of Beeswax with which I made Candles in my  African  Adventure but I had none of that now the only Remedy I had was that when I had kill'd a Goat I sav'd the Tallow and with a little Dish made of Clay which I bak'd in the Sun to which I added a Wick of some Oakum I made me a Lamp and this gave me Light tho' not a clear steady Light like a Candle in the Middle of all my Labours it happen'd that rumaging my Things I found a little Bag which as I hinted before had been fill'd with Corn for the feeding of Poultry not for this Voyage but before as I suppose when the Ship came from  Lisbon  what little Remainder of Corn had been in the Bag was all devour'd with the Rats and I saw nothing in the Bag but Husks and Dust and being willing to have the Bag for some other Use I think it was to put Powder in when I divided it for Fear of the Lightning or some such Use I shook the Husks of Corn out of it on one Side of my Fortification under the Rock  It was a little before the great Rains just now mention'd that I threw this Stuff away taking no Notice of any Thing and not so much as remembring that I had thrown any Thing there when about a Month after or thereabout I saw some few Stalks of something green shooting out of the Ground which I fancy'd might be some Plant I had not seen but I was surpriz'd and perfectly astonish'd when after a little longer Time I saw about ten or twelve Ears come out which were perfect green Barley of the same Kind as our  European  nay as our  English  Barley  It is impossible to express the Astonishment and Confusion of my Thoughts on this Occasion I had hitherto acted upon no religious Foundation at all indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in my Head or had entertain'd any Sense of any Thing that had befallen me otherwise than as a Chance or as we lightly say what pleases God without so much as enquiring into the End of Providence in these Things or his Order in governing Events in the World But after I saw Barley grow there in a Climate which I know was not proper for Corn and especially that I knew not how it came there it startl'd me strangely and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caus'd this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed sown and that it was so directed purely for my Sustenance on that wild miserable Place  This touch'd my Heart a little and brought Tears out of my Eyes and I began to bless my self that such a Prodigy of Nature should happen upon my Account and this was the more strange to me because I saw near it still all along by the Side of the Rock some other straggling Stalks which prov'd to be Stalks of Ryce and which I knew because I had seen it grow in  Africa  when I was ashore there  I not only thought these the pure Productions of Providence for my Support but not doubting but that there was more in the Place I went all over that Part of the Island where I had been before peering in every Corner and under every Rock to see for more of it but I could not find any at last it occur'd to my Thoughts that I had shook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place and then the Wonder began to cease and I must confess my religious Thankfulness to God's Providence began to abate too upon the Discovering that all this was nothing but what was  common tho' I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforseen Providence as if it had been miraculous for it was really the Work of Providence as to me that should order or appoint that or Grains of Corn should remuin unspoil'd when the Rats had destroy'd all the rest as if it had been dropt from Heaven as also that I should throw it out in that particular Place where it being in the Shade of a high Rock it sprang up immediately whereas if I had thrown it anywhere else at that Time it had been burnt up and destroy'd  I carefully sav'd the Ears of this Corn you may be sure in their Season which was about the End of  June  and laying up every Corn I resolv'd to sow them all again hoping in Time to have some Quantity sufficient to supply me with Bread But it was not till the th Year that I could allow my self the least Grain of this Corn to eat and even then but sparingly as I shall say afterwards in its Order for I lost all that I sow'd the first Season by not observing the proper Time for I sow'd it just before the dry Season so that it never came up at all at least not as it would ha' done Of which in its Place  Besides this Barley there was as above or Stalks of Ryce which I preserv'd with the same Care and whose Use was of the same Kind or to the same Purpose  viz  to make me Bread or rather Food for I found Ways to cook it up without baking tho' I did that also after some Time But to return to my Journal  I work'd excessive hard these three or four Months to get my Wall done and the th of  April  I closed it up contriving to go into it not by a Door but over the Wall by a Ladder that  there might be no Sign in the Outside of my Habitation  April  I finish'd the Ladder so I went up with the Ladder to the Top and then pull'd it up after me and let it down in the Inside This was a compleat Enclosure to me for within I had Room enough and nothing could come at me from without unless it could first mount my Wall  The very next Day after this Wall was finish'd I had almost had all my Labour overthrown at once and my self kill'd the Case was thus As I was busy in the Inside of it behind my Tent just in the Entrance into my Cave I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising Thing indeed for all on a sudden I found the Earth come crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave and from the Edge of the Hill over my Head and two of the Posts I had set up in the Cave crack'd in a frightful Manner I was heartily scar'd but thought nothing of what was really the Cause only thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in as some of it had done before and for Fear I shou'd be bury'd in it I run foreward to my Ladder and not thinking my self safe there neither I got over my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I expected might roll down upon me I was no sooner stepp'd down upon the firm Ground but I plainly saw it was a terrible Earthquake for the Ground I stood on shook three Times at about eight Minutes Distance with three such Shocks as would have overturn'd the strongest Building that could be suppos'd to have stood on the Earth and a great Piece of the Top of a Rock which stood about half a Mile from me next the Sea fell down with such a terrible Noise as I never heard in all my Life I perceiv'd also the very Sea was put into violent Motion by it and I believe the  Shocks were stronger under the Water than on the Island  I was so amaz'd with the Thing it self having never felt the like or discours'd with any one that had that I was like one dead or stupify'd and the Motion of the Earth made my Stomach sick like one that was toss'd at Sea but the Noise of the falling of the Rock awak'd me as it were and rousing me from the stupify'd Condition I was in fill'd me with Horror and I thought of nothing then but the Hill falling upon my Tent and all my houshold Goods and burying all at once and this sunk my very Soul within me a second Time  After the third Shock was over and I felt no more for some Time I began to take Courage and yet I had not Heart enough to go over my Wall again for Fear of being buried alive but sat still upon the Ground greatly cast down and disconsolate not knowing what to do All this while I had not the least serious religious Thought nothing but the common  Lord ha' Mercy upon me  and when it was over that went away too  While I sat thus I found the Air overcast and grow cloudy as if it would Rain soon after that the Wind rose by little and little so that in less than half an Hour it blew a most dreadful Hurricane The Sea was all on a Sudden cover'd over with Foam and Froth the Shore was cover'd with the Breach of the Water the Trees were torn up by the Roots and a terrible Storm it was and this held about three Hours and then began to abate and in two Hours more it was stark calm and began to rain very hard  All this while I sat upon the Ground very much terrify'd and dejected when on a sudden it came into my thoughts that these Winds and Rain being the Consequences of the Earthquake the Earthquake  it self was spent and over and I might venture into my Cave again With this Thought my Spirits began to revive and the Rain also helping to perswade me I went in and sat down in my Tent but the Rain was so violent that my Tent was ready to be beaten down with it and I was forc'd to go into my Cave tho' very much affraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on my Head  This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work  viz  To cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a Sink to let the Water go out which would else have drown'd my Cave After I had been in my Cave some time and found still no more Shocks of the Earthquake follow I began to be more compos'd and now to support my Spirits which indeed wanted it very much I went to my little Store and took a small Sup of Rum which however I did then and always very sparingly knowing I could have no more when that was gone  It continu'd raining all that Night and great Part of the next Day so that I could not stir abroad but my Mind being more compos'd I began to think of what I had best do concluding that if the Island was subject to these Earthquakes there would be no living for me in a Cave but I must consider of building me some little Hut in an open Place which I might surround with a Wall as I had done here and so make my self secure from wild Beasts or Men but concluded if I staid where I was I should certainly one time or other be bury'd alive  With these Thoughts I resolv'd to remove my Tent from the Place where it stood which was just under the hanging Precipice of the Hill and which if it should be shaken again would certainly fall upon my Tent And I spent the two next  Days being the th and th of  April  in contriving where and how to remove my Habitation  The fear of being swallow'd up alive made me that I never slept in quiet and yet the Apprehensions of lying abroad without any Fence was almost equal to it but still when I look'd about and saw how every thing was put in order how pleasantly conceal'd I was and how safe from Danger it made me very loath to remove  In the mean time it occur'd to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this and that I must be contented to run the Venture where I was till I had form'd a Camp for my self and had secur'd it so as to remove to it So with this Resolution I compos'd my self for a time and resolv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to build me a Wall with Piles and Cables  c  in a Circle as before and set my Tent up in it when it was finish'd but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finish'd and fit to remove to This was the st  April  The next Morning I began to consider of Means to put this Resolve in Execution but I was at a great loss about my Tools I had three large Axes and abundance of Hatchets for we carried the Hatchets for Traffick with the  Indians  but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard Wood they were all full of Notches and dull and tho' I had a Grindstone I could not turn it and grind my Tools too this cost me as much Thought as a Statesman would have bestow'd upon a grand Point of Politicks or a Judge upon the Life and Death of a Man At length I contriv'd a Wheel with a String to turn it with my Foot that I might have both my Hands at Liberty  Note  I had never seen any such thing in  England  or at least not to take Notice how it was done tho' since I  have observ'd it is very common there besides that my Grindstone was very large and heavy This Machine cost me a full Weeks Work to bring it to Perfection  April  These two whole Days I took up in grinding my Tools my Machine for turning my Grindstone performing very well  April  Having perceiv'd my Bread had been low a great while now I took a Survey of it and reduc'd my self to one Bisketcake a Day which made my Heart very heavy  May  In the Morning looking towards the Seaside the Tide being low I saw something lye on the Shore bigger than ordinary and it look'd like a Cask when I came to it I found a small Barrel and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of the Ship which were driven on Shore by the late Hurricane and looking towards the Wreck itself I thought it seem'd to lye higher out of the Water than it us'd to do I examin'd the Barrel which was driven on Shore and soon found it was a Barrel of Gunpowder but it had taken Water and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone however I roll'd it farther on Shore for the present and went on upon the Sands as near as I could to the Wreck of the Ship to look for more  When I came down to the Ship I found it strangely remov'd The Forecastle which lay before bury'd in Sand was heav'd up at least Six Foot and the Stern which was broke to Pieces and parted from the rest by the Force of the Sea soon after I had left rummaging her was toss'd as it were up and cast on one Side and the Sand was thrown so high on that Side next her Stern that whereas there was a great Place of Water before so that I could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wreck without swimming I could now walk  quite up to her when the Tide was out I was surpriz'd with this at first but soon concluded it must be done by the Earthquake and as by this Violence the Ship was more broken open than formerly so many Things came daily on Shore which the Sea had loosen'd and which the Winds and Water rolled by Degrees to the Land  This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Design of removing my Habitation and I busied my self mightily that Day especially in searching whether I could make any Way into the Ship but I found nothing was to be expected of that Kind for that all the Inside of the Ship was choack'd up with Sand However as I had learn'd not to despair of any Thing I resolv'd to pull every Thing to Pieces that I could of the Ship concluding that every Thing I could get from her would be of some Use or other to me  May  I began with my Saw and cut a Piece of a Beam thro' which I thought held some of the upper Part or QuarterDeck together and when I had cut it thro' I clear'd away the Sand as well as I could from the Side which lay highest but the Tide coming in I was oblig'd to give over for that Time  May  I went a fishing but caught not one Fish that I durst eat of till I was weary of my Sport when just going to leave off I caught a young Dolphin I had made me a long Line of some Rope Yarn but I had no Hooks yet I frequently caught Fish enough as much as I car'd to eat all which I dry'd in the Sun and eat them dry  May  Work'd on the Wreck cut another Beam asunder and brought three great Fir Planks off from the Decks which I ty'd together and made swim on Shore when the Tide of Flood came on  May  Work'd on the Wreck got several Iron Bolts out of her and other Pieces of Iron Work work'd very hard and came Home very much tyr'd and had Thoughts of giving it over  May  Went to the Wreck again but with an Intent not to work but found the Weight of the Wreck had broke itself down the Beams being cut that several Pieces of the Ship seem'd to lie loose and the Inside of the Hold lay so open that I could see into it but almost full of Water and Sand  May  Went to the Wreck and carry'd an Iron Crow to wrench up the Deck which lay now quite clear of the Water or Sand I wrench'd open two Planks and brought them on Shore also with the Tide I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next Day  May  Went to the Wreck and with the Crow made Way into the Body of the Wreck and felt several Casks and loosen'd them with the Crow but could not break them up I felt also the Roll of  English  Lead and could stir it but it was too heavy to remove  May  Went every Day to the Wreck and got a great deal of Pieces of Timber and Boards or Plank and or Weight of Iron  May  I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead by placing the Edge of one Hatchet and driving it with the other but as it lay about a Foot and a half in the Water I could not make any Blow to drive the Hatchet  May  It had blow'd hard in the Night and the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of the Water but I stay'd so long in the Woods to get Pidgeons for Food that the Tide prevented me going to the Wreck that Day  May  I saw some Pieces of the Wreck blown on Shore at a great Distance near two Miles off me but resolv'd to see what they were and found it was a Piece of the Head but too heavy for me to bring away  May  Every Day to this Day I work'd on the Wreck and with hard Labour I loosen'd some Things so much with the Crow that the first blowing Tide several Casks floated out and two of the Seamens Chests but the Wind blowing from the Shore nothing came to Land that Day but Pieces of Timber and a Hogshead which had some  Brazil  Pork in it but the Saltwater and the Sand had spoil'd it  I continu'd this Work every Day to the th of  June  except the Time necessary to get Food which I always appointed during this Part of my Employment to be when the Tide was up that I might be ready when it was ebb'd out and by this Time I had gotten Timber and Plank and IronWork enough to have builded a good Boat if I had known how and also I got at several Times and in several Pieces near Weight of the SheetLead  June  Going down to the Seaside I found a large Tortoise or Turtle this was the first I had seen which it seems was only my Misfortune not any Defect of the Place or Scarcity for had I happen'd to be on the other Side of the Island I might have had Hundreds of them every Day as I found afterwards but perhaps had paid dear enough for them  June  I spent in cooking the Turtle I found in her threescore Eggs and her Flesh was to me at that Time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my Life having had no Flesh  but of Goats and Fowls since I landed in this horrid Place  June  Rain'd all Day and I stay'd within I thought at this Time the Rain felt Cold and I was something chilly which I knew was not usual in that Latitude  June  Very ill and shivering as if the Weather had been cold  June  No Rest all Night violent Pains in my Head and feaverish  June  Very ill frighted almost to Death with the Apprehensions of my sad Condition to be sick and no Help Pray'd to GOD for the first Time since the Storm off of  Hull  but scarce knew what I said or why my Thoughts being all confused  June  A little better but under dreadful Apprehensions of Sickness  June  Very bad again cold and shivering and then a violent Headach  June  Much better  June  An Ague very violent the Fit held me seven Hours cold Fit and hot with faint Sweats after it  June  Better and having no Victuals to eat took my Gun but found my self very weak however I kill'd a SheGoat and with much Difficulty got it Home and broil'd some of it and eat I wou'd fain have stew'd it and made some Broath but had no Pot  June  The Ague again so violent that I lay aBed all Day and neither eat or drank I was ready to perish for Thirst but so weak I had not Strength to stand up or to get my self any Water to drink Pray'd to God again but was lightheaded and when I was not I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say only I lay and  cry'd  Lord look upon me Lord pity me Lord have Mercy upon me  I suppose I did nothing else for two or three Hours till the Fit wearing off I fell asleep and did not wake till far in the Night when I wak'd I found my self much refresh'd but weak and exceeding thirsty However as I had no Water in my whole Habitation I was forc'd to lie till Morning and went to sleep again In this second Sleep I had this terrible Dream  I thought that I was sitting on the Ground on the Outside of my Wall where I sat when the Storm blew after the Earthquake and that I saw a Man descend from a great black Cloud in a bright Flame of Fire and light upon the Ground He was all over as bright as a Flame so that I could but just bear to look towards him his Countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful impossible for Words to describe when he stepp'd upon the Ground with his Feet I thought the Earth trembl'd just as it had done before in the Earthquake and all the Air look'd to my Apprehension as if it had been fill'd with Flashes of Fire  He was no sooner landed upon the Earth but he moved forward towards me with a long Spear or Weapon in his Hand to kill me and when he came to a rising Ground at some Distance he spoke to me or I heard a Voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the Terror of it all that I can say I understood was this  Seeing all these Things have not brought thee to Repentance now thou shalt die  At which Words I thought he lifted up the Spear that was in his Hand to kill me  No one that shall ever read this Account will expect that I should be able to describe the Horrors of my Soul at this terrible Vision I mean that even while it was a Dream I even dreamed of those Horrors nor is it any more possible to describe  the Impression that remain'd upon my Mind when I awak'd and found it was but a Dream  I had alas no divine Knowledge what I had received by the good Instruction of my Father was then worn out by an uninterrupted Series for Years of Seafaring Wickedness and a constant Conversation with nothing but such as were like my self wicked and prophane to the last Degree I do not remember that I had in all that Time one Thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward God or inwards towards a Reflection upon my own Ways But a certain Stupidity of Soul without Desire of Good or Conscience of Evil had entirely overwhelm'd me and I was all that the most hardned unthinking wicked Creature among our common Sailors can be supposed to be not having the least Sense either of the Fear of God in Danger or of Thankfulness to God in Deliverances  In the relating what is already past of my Story this will be the more easily believ'd when I shall add that thro' all the Variety of Miseries that had to this Day befallen me I never had so much as one Thought of it being the Hand of God or that it was a just Punishment for my Sin my rebellious Behaviour against my Father or my present Sins which were great or so much as a Punishment for the general Course of my wicked Life When I was on the desperate Expedition on the desart Shores of  Africa  I never had so much as one Thought of what would become of me or one Wish to God to direct me whether I should go or to keep me from the Danger which apparently surrounded me as well from voracious Creatures as cruel Savages But I was meerly thoughtless of a God or a Providence acted like a meer Brute from the Principles of Nature and by the Dictates of common Sense only and indeed hardly that  When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the  Portugal  Captain well us'd and dealt justly and honourably with as well as charitably I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts When again I was shipwreck'd ruin'd and in Danger of drowning on this Island I was as far from Remorse or looking on it as a Judgment I only said to my self often that I was  an unfortunate Dog  and born to be always miserable  It is true when I got on Shore first here and found all my Ship's Crew drown'd and my self spar'd I was surpriz'd with a Kind of Extasie and some Transports of Soul which had the Grace of God assisted might have come up to true Thankfulness but it ended where it begun in a meer common Flight of Joy or as I may say  being glad I was alive  without the least Reflection upon the distinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv'd me and had singled me out to be preserv'd when all the rest were destroy'd or an Enquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me even just the same common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have after they are got safe ashore from a Shipwreck which they drown all in the next Bowl of Punch and forget almost as soon as it is over and all the rest of my Life was like it  Even when I was afterwards on due Consideration made sensible of my Condition how I was cast on this dreadful Place out of the Reach of humane Kind out of all Hope of Relief or Prospect of Redemption as soon as I saw but a Prospect of living and that I should not starve and perish for Hunger all the Sense of my Affliction wore off and I begun to be very easy apply'd my self to the Works proper for my Preservation and Supply and was far enough from being afflicted at my Condition as a Judgment from Heaven or as the  Hand of God against me these were Thoughts which very seldom enter'd into my Head  The growing up of the Corn as is hinted in my Journal had at first some little Influence upon me and began to affect me with Seriousness as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it but as soon as ever that Part of the Thought was remov'd all the Impression which was rais'd from it wore off also as I have noted already  Even the Earthquake tho' nothing could be more terrible in its Nature or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such Things yet no sooner was the first Fright over but the Impression it had made went off also I had no more Sense of God or his Judgments much less of the present Affliction of my Circumstances being from his Hand than if I had been in the most prosperous Condition of Life  But now when I began to be sick and a leisurely View of the Miseries of Death came to place itself before me when my Spirits began to sink under the Burthen of a strong Distemper and Nature was exhausted with the Violence of the Feaver Conscience that had slept so long begun to awake and I began to reproach my self with my past Life in which I had so evidently by uncommon Wickedness provok'd the Justice of God to lay me under uncommon Strokes and to deal with me in so vindictive a Manner  These Reflections oppress'd me for the second or third Day of my Distemper and in the Violence as well of the Feaver as of the dreadful Reproaches of my Conscience extorted some Words from me like praying to God tho' I cannot say they were either a Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes it was rather the Voice of meer Fright and Distress my Thoughts were confus'd the  Convictions great upon my Mind and the Horror of dying in such a miserable Condition rais'd Vapours into my Head with the meer Apprehensions and in these Hurries of my Soul I know not what my Tongue might express but it was rather Exclamation such as Lord what a miserable Creature am I If I should be sick I shall certainly die for Want of Help and what will become of me Then the Tears burst out of my Eyes and I could say no more for a good while  In this Interval the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind and presently his Prediction which I mention'd at the Beginning of this Story  viz That if I did take this foolish Step God would not bless me and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in my Recovery  Now said I aloud My dear Father's Words are come to pass God's Justice has overtaken me and I have none to help or hear me I rejected the Voice of Providence which had mercifully put me in a Posture or Station of Life wherein I might have been happy and easy but I would neither see it my self or learn to know the Blessing of it from my Parents I left them to mourn over my Folly and now I am left to mourn under the Consequences of it I refus'd their Help and Assistance who wou'd have lifted me into the World and wou'd have made every Thing easy to me and now I have Difficulties to struggle with too great for even Nature itself to support and no Assistance no Help no Comfort no Advice then I cry'd out  Lord be my Help for I am in great Distress    This was the first Prayer if I may call it so that I had made for many Years But I return to my Journal  June  Having been somewhat refresh'd with the Sleep I had had and the Fit being entirely off I got up and tho' the Fright and Terror of my Dream was very great yet I consider'd that the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next Day and now was my Time to get something to refresh and support my self when I should be ill and the first Thing I did I fill'd a large square Case Bottle with Water and set it upon my Table in Reach of my Bed and to take off the chill or a guish Disposition of the Water I put about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it and mix'd them together then I got me a Piece of the Goat's Flesh and broil'd it on the Coals but could eat very little I walk'd about but was very weak and withal very sad and heavyhearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day at Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's Eggs which I roasted in the Ashes and eat as we call it in the Shell and this was the first Bit of Meat I had ever ask'd God's Blessing to even as I cou'd remember in my whole Life  After I had eaten I try'd to walk but found my self so weak that I cou'd hardly carry the Gun for I never went out without that so I went but a little Way and sat down upon the Ground looking out upon the Sea which was just before me and very calm and smooth As I sat here some such Thoughts as these occurred to me  What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much whence is it produc'd and what am I and all the other Creatures wild and tame humane and brutal whence are we  Sure we are all made by some secret Power who form'd the Earth and Sea rhe Air and Sky and who is that  Then it follow'd most naturally It is God that has made it all Well but then it came on strangely if God has made all these Things He guides and governs them all and all Things that concern them for the Power that could make all Things must certainly have Power to guide and direct them  If so nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works either without his Knowledge or Appointment  And if nothing happens without his Knowledge he knows that I am here and am in this dreadful Condition and if nothing happens without his Appointment he has appointed all this to befal me  Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict any of these Conclusions and therefore it rested upon me with the greater Force that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to befal me that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance by his Direction he having the sole Power not of me only but of every Thing that happen'd in the World Immediately it follow'd  Why has God done this to me What have I done to be thus us'd  My Conscience presently check'd me in that Enquiry as if I had blasphem'd and methought it spoke to me like a Voice  WRETCH dost thou ask what thou hast done  look back upon a dreadful misspent Life and ask thy self  what thou hast not done  ask Why is it  that thou wert not long ago destroy'd  Why  wert thou not drown'd in  Yarmouth Roads  Kill'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by  the Sallee Man of War  Devour'd by the wild Beasts  on the  Coast of Africa Or  Drown'd HERE when all the Crew perish'd but thy self  Dost thou ask  What have I done  I was struck dumb with these Reflections as one astonish'd and had not a Word to say no not to answer to my self but rise up pensive and sad walk'd back to my Retreat and went up over my Wall as if I had been going to Bed but my Thoughts were sadly disturb'd and I had no Inclination to Sleep so I sat down in my Chair and lighted my Lamp for it began to be dark Now as the Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify'd me very much it occurr'd to my Thought that the  Brasilians  take no Physick but their Tobacco for almost all Distempers and I had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the Chests which was quite cur'd and some also that was green and not quite cur'd  I went directed by Heaven no doubt for in this Chest I found a Cure both for Soul and Body I open'd the Chest and found what I look'd for  viz  the Tobacco and as the few Books I had sav'd lay there too I took out one of the Bibles which I mention'd before and which to this Time I had not found Leisure or so much as Inclination to look into I say I took it out and brought both that and the Tobacco with me to the Table  What Use to make of the Tobacco I knew not as to my Distemper or whether it was good for it or no but I try'd several Experiments with it as if I was resolv'd it should hit one Way or other I first took a Piece of a Leaf and chew'd it in my Mouth which indeed at first almost stupify'd my Brain the Tobacco being green and strong and that I had not been much us'd to it then I took some and steeped it an Hour or two in some Rum and resolv'd to take a Dose of it when I lay down  and lastly I burnt some upon a Pan of Coals and held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as long as I could bear it as well for the Heat as almost for Suffocation  In the Interval of this Operation I took up the Bible and began to read but my Head was too much disturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading at least that Time only having open'd the Book casually the first Words that occurr'd to me were these  Call on me in the Day of Trouble and I will deliver and thou shalt glorify me    The Words were very apt to my Case and made some Impression upon my Thoughts at the Time of reading them tho' not so much as they did afterwards for as for being deliver'd the Word had no Sound  as I may say  to me the Thing was so remote so impossible in my Apprehension of Things that I began to say as the Children of  Israel  did when they were promis'd Flesh to eat  Can God spread a Table in the Wilderness  so I began to say Can God himself deliver me from this Place and as it was not for many Years that any Hope appear'd this prevail'd very often upon my Thoughts But however the Words made a great Impression upon me and I mused upon them very often It grew now late and the Tobacco had as I said doz'd my Head so much that I inclin'd to sleep so I left my Lamp burning in the Cave least I should want any Thing in the Night and went to Bed but before I lay down I did what I never had done in all my Life I kneel'd down and pray'd to God to fulfil the Promise to me that if I call'd upon him in the Day of Trouble he would deliver me after my broken and imperfect Prayer was over I drunk the Rum in which I had steep'd the Tobacco which was so strong and rank of rhe Tobacco that indeed I could scarce get it down immediately  upon this I went to Bed I found presently it flew up in my Head violently but I fell into a sound Sleep and wak'd no more 'till by the Sun it must necessarily be near Three aClock in the Afternoon the next Day nay to this Hour I'm partly of the Opinion that I slept all the next Day and Night and 'till almost Three that Day after for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a Day out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week as it appear'd some Years after I had done for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the Line I should have lost more than one Day But certainly I lost a Day in my Accompt and never knew which Way  Be that however one Way or th' other when I awak'd I found my self exceedingly refresh'd and my Spirits lively and chearful when I got up I was stronger than I was the Day before and my Stomach better for I was hungry and in short I had no Fit the next Day but continu'd much alter'd for the better this was the th  The th was my well Day of Course and I went abroad with my Gun but did not care to travel too far I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two something like a brand Goose and brought them Home but was not very forward to eat them so I ate some more of the Turtle's Eggs which were very good This Evening I renew'd the Medicine which I had suppos'd did me good the Day before  viz  the Tobacco steep'd in Rum only I did not take so much as before nor did I chew any of the Leaf or hold my Head over the Smoke however I was not so well the next Day which was the first of  July  as I hop'd I shou'd have been for I had a little Spice of the cold Fit but it was not much  July  I renew'd the Medicine all the three Ways and doz'd my self with it as at first and doubled the Quantity which I drank  I miss'd the Fit for good and all tho' I did not recover my full Strength for some Weeks after while I was thus gathering Strength my Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture  I will deliver thee  and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my Mind in Barr of my ever expecting it But as I was discouraging my self with such Thoughts it occurr'd to my Mind that I pored so much upon my Deliverance from the main Affliction that I disregarded the Deliverance I had receiv'd and I was as it were made to ask my self such Questions as these  viz  Have I not been deliver'd and wonderfully too from Sickness from the most distress'd Condition that could be and that was so frightful to me and what Notice I had taken of it Had I done my Part  God had deliver'd me but I had not glorify'd him  that is to say I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a Deliverance and how cou'd I expect greater Deliverance  This touch'd my Heart very much and immediately I kneeel'd down and gave God Thanks aloud for my Recovery from my Sickness  July  In the Morning I took the Bible and beginning at the New Testament I began seriously to read it and impos'd upon my self to read a while every Morning and every Night not tying my self to the Number of Chapters but as long as my Thoughts shou'd engage me It was not long after I set seriously to this Work but I found my Heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the Wickedness of my past Life The Impression of my Dream reviv'd and the Words  All these Things have not brought thee to Repentance  ran seriously in my Thought I was earnestly begging of God to give me Repentance when it happen'd providentially the very Day that reading the Scriture  I came to these Words  He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour to give Repentance and to give Remission  I threw down the Book and with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven in a Kind of Extasy of Joy I cry'd out aloud  Jesus thou Son of  David  Jesus thou exalted Prince and Saviour give me Repentance  This was the first Time that I could say in the true Sense of the Words that I pray'd in all my Life for now I pray'd with a Sense of my Condition and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded on the Encouragement of the Word of God and from this Time I may say I began to have Hope that God would hear me  Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above  Call on me and I will deliver you  in a different Sense from what I had ever done before for then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd Deliverance but my being deliver'd from the Captivity I was in for tho' I was indeed at large in the Place yet the Island was certainly a Prison to me and that in the worst Sense in the World but now I learn'd to take it in another Sense Now I look'd back upon my past Life with such Horrour and my Sins appear'd so dreadful that my Soul sought nothing of God but Deliverance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort As for my solitary Life it was nothing I did not so much as pray to be deliver'd from it or think of it It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this And I add this Part here to hint to whoever shall read it that whenever they come to a true Sense of things they will find Deliverance from Sin a much greater Blessing that Deliverance from Affliction  But leaving this Part I return to my Journal  My Condition began now to be tho' not less miserable as to my Way of living yet much easier to my Mind and my Thoughts being directed by a constant reading the Scripture and praying to God to things of a higher Nature I had a great deal of Comfort within which till now I knew nothing of also as my Health and Strength returned I bestirr'd my self to furnish my self with every thing that I wanted and make my Way of living as regular as I could  From the th of  July  to the th I was chiefly employ'd in walking about with my Gun in my Hand a little and a little at a Time as a Man that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness For it is hardly to be imagin'd how low I was and to what Weakness I was reduc'd The Application which I made Use of was perfectly new and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague before neither can I recommend it to any one to practise by this Experiment and tho' it did carry off the Fit yet it rather contributed to weakening me for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and Limbs for some Time  I learn'd from it also this in particular that being abroad in the rainy Season was the most pernicious thing to my Health that could be especially in those Rains which came attended with Storms and Hurricanes of Wind for as the Rain which came in the dry Season was always most accompany'd with such Storms so I found that Rain was much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in  September  and  October    I had been now in this unhappy Island above Months all Possibility of Deliverance from this Condition seem'd to be entirely taken from me and I firmly believed that no humane Shape had ever set Foot upon that Place Having now secur'd  my Habitation as I thought fully to my Mind I had a great Desire to make a more perfect Discovery of the Island and to see what other Productions I might find which I yet knew nothing of  It was the th of  July  that I began to take a more particular Survey of the Island it self I went up the Creek first where as I hinted I brought my Rafts on Shore I found after I came about two Miles up that the Tide did not flow any higher and that it was no more than a little Brook of running Water and very fresh and good but this being the dry Season there was hardly any Water in some Parrs of it at least not enough to run in any Stream so as it could be perceiv'd  On the Bank of this Brook I found many pleasant  Savana's  or Meadows plain smooth and cover'd with Grass and on the rising Parts of them next to the higher Grounds where the Water as it might be supposed never overflow'd I found a great deal of Tobacco green and growing to a great and very strong Stalk there were divers other Plants which I had no Notion of or Understanding about and might perhaps have Vertues of their own which I could not find out  I searched for the  Cassava  Root which the  Indians  in all that Climate make their Bread of but I could find none I saw large Plants of Alloes but did not then understand them I saw several Sugar Canes but wild and for want of Cultivation imperfect I contented my self with these Discoveries for this Time and came back musing with my self what Course I might take to know the Vertue and Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which I should discover but could bring it to no Conclusion for in short I had made so little Observation while I was in the  Brasils  that I knew little  of the Plants in the Field at least very little that might serve me to any Purpose now in my Distress  The next Day the th I went up the same Way again and after going something farther than I had gone the Day before I found the Brook and the  Savana's  began to cease and the Country became more woody than before in this Part I found different Fruits and particularly I found Mellons upon the Ground in great Abundance and Grapes upon the Trees the Vines had spread indeed over the Trees and the Clusters of Grapes were just now in their Prime very ripe and rich This was a surprising Discovery and I was exceeding glad of them but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat sparingly of them remembring that when I was ashore in  Barbary  the eating of Grapes kill'd several of our  English  Men who were Slaves there by throwing them into Fluxes and Feavers But I found an excellent Use for these Grapes and that was to cure or dry them in the Sun and keep them as dry'd Grapes or Raisins are kept which I thought would be as indeed they were as wholesom as agreeable to eat when no Grapes might be to be had  I spent all that Evening there and went not back to my Habitation which by the Way was the first Night as I might say I had lain from Home In the Night I took my first Contrivance and got up into a Tree where I slept well and the next Morning proceeded upon my Discovery travelling near four Miles as I might judge by the Length of the Valley keeping still due North with a Ridge of Hills on the South and Northside of me  At the End of this March I came to an Opening where the Country seem'd to descend to the  West and a litrle Spring of fresh Water which issued out of the Side of the Hill by me run the other Way that is due East and the Country appear'd so fresh so green so flourishing every thing being in a constant Verdure or Flourish of  Spring  that it looked like a planted Garden  I descended a little on the Side of that delicious Vale surveying it with a secret Kind of Pleasure tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts to think that this was all my own that I was King and Lord of all this Country indefeasibly and had a Right of Possession and if I could convey it I might have it in Inheritance as compleatly as any Lord of a Mannor in  England  I saw here Abundance of Cocoa Trees Orange and Lemmon and Citron Trees but all wild and very few bearing any Fruit at least not then However the green Limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat but very wholesome and I mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water which made it very wholesome and very cool and refreshing  I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home and I resolv'd to lay up a Store as well of Grapes as Limes and Lemons to furnish my self for the wet Season which I knew was approaching  In Order to this I gather'd a great Heap of Grapes in one Place and a lesser Heap in another Place and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in another Place and taking a few of each with me I travell'd homeward and resolv'd to come again and bring a Bag or Sack or what I could make to carry the rest Home  Accordingly having spent three Days in this Journey I came Home so I must now call my Tent and my Cave But before I got thither the  Grapes were spoil'd the Richness of the Fruits and the Weight of the Juice having broken them and bruis'd them they were good for little or nothing as to the Limes they were good but I could bring but a few  The next Day being the th I went back having made me two small Bags to bring Home my Harvest But I was surpriz'd when coming to my Heap of Grapes which were so rich and fine when I gather'd them I found them all spread about trod to Pieces and dragg'd about some here some there and Abundance eaten and devour'd By this I concluded there were some wild Creatures thereabouts which had done this but what they were I knew not  However as I found there there was no laying them up on Heaps and no carrying them away in a Sack but that one Way they would be destroy'd and the other Way they would be crush'd with their own Weight I took another Course for I gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes and hung them up upon the out Branches of the Trees that they might cure and dry in the Sun and as for the Limes and Lemons I carry'd as many back as I could well stand under  When I came Home from this Journey I contemplated with great Pleasure the Fruitfulness of that Valley and the Pleasantness of the Scituation the Security from Storms on that Side the Water and the Wood and concluded that I had pitch'd upon a Place to fix my Abode which was by far the worst Part of the Country Upon the Whole I began to consider of removing my Habitation and to look out for a Place equally safe as where I now was scituate if possible in that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island  This Thought run long in my Head and I was exceeding fond of it for some Time the Pleasantness of the Place tempting me but when I came to a nearer View of it and to consider that I was now by the SeaSide where it was at least possible that something might happen to my Advantage and by the same ill Fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappy Wretches to the same Place and tho' it was scarce probable that any such Thing should ever happen yet to enclose my self among the Hills and Woods in the Center of the Island was to anticipate my Bondage and to rend such an Affair not only Improbable but Impossible and that therefore I ought not by any Means to remove  However I was so Enamour'd of this Place that I spent much of my Time there for the whole remaining Part of the Month of  July  and tho' upon second Thoughts I resolv'd as above not to remove yet I built me a little kind of a Bower and surrounded it at a Distance with a strong Fence being a double Hedge as high as I could reach well stak'd and fill'd between with  Brushwood  and here I lay very secure sometimes two or three Nights together always going over it with a Ladder as before so that I fancy'd now I had my CountryHouse and my SeaCoastHouse And this Work took me up to the Beginning of  August    I had but newly finish'd my Fence and began to enjoy my Labour but the Rains came on and made me stick close to my first Habitation for tho' I had made me a Tent like the other with a Piece of a Sail and spread it very well yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms nor a Cave behind me to retreat into when the Rains were extraordinary  About the Beginning of  August as I said  I had finish'd my Bower and began to enjoy my self The third of  August  I found the Grapes I had hung up were perfectly dry'd and indeed were excellent good Raisins of the Sun so I began to take them down from the Trees and it was very happy that I did so for the Rains which follow'd would have spoil'd them and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food for I had above two hundred large Bunches of them No sooner had I taken them all down and carry'd most of them Home to my Cave but it began to rain and from hence which was the fourteenth of  August  it rain'd more or less every Day till the Middle of  October  and sometimes so violently that I could not stir out of my Cave for several Days  In this Season I was much surpriz'd with the Increase of my Family I had been concern'd for the Loss of one of my Cats who run away from me or as I thought had been dead and I heard no more Tale or Tidings of her till to my Astonishment she came Home about the End of  August  with three  Kittens  this was the more strange to me because tho' I had kill'd a wild Cat as I call'd it with my Gun yet I thought it was a quite differing Kind from our  European  Cats yet the young Cats were the same Kind of House breed like the old one and both my Cats being Females I thought it very strange But from these three Cats I afterwards came to be so pester'd with Cats that I was forc'd to kill them like Vermine or wild Beasts and to drive them from my House as much as possible  From the fourteenth of  August  to the twenty sixth incessant Rain so that I could not stir and was now very careful not to be much wet In this Confinement I began to be straitned for Food but  venturing out twice I one Day kill'd a Goat and the last Day which was the twenty sixth found a very large Tortoise which was a Treat to me and my Food was regulated thus I eat a Bunch of Raisins for my Breakfast a Piece of the Goat's Flesh or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd for to my great Misfortune I had no Vessel to boil or stew any Thing and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs for my Supper  During this Confinement in my Cover by the Rain I work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my Cave and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side till I came to the OutSide of the Hill and made a Door or Way out which came beyond my Fence or Wall and so I came in and out this Way but I was not perfectly easy at lying so open for as I had manag'd my self before I was in a perfect Enclosure whereas now I thought I lay expos'd and open for any Thing to come in upon me and yet I could not perceive that there was any living Thing to fear the biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon the Island being a Goat  September  the thirtieth I was now come to the unhappy Anniversary of my Landing I cast up the Notches on my Post and found I had been on Shore three hundred and sixty five Days I kept this Day as a Solemn Fast setting it apart to Religious Exercise prostrating my self on the Ground with the most serious Humiliation confessing my Sins to God acknowledging his Righteous Judgments upon me and praying to him to have Mercy on me through Jesus Christ and having not tasted the least Refreshment for twelve Hours even till the going down of the Sun I then eat a Bisket Cake and a Bunch of Grapes and went to Bed finishing the Day as I began it  I had all this Time observ'd no SabbathDay for as at first I had no Sense of Religion upon my Mind I had after some Time omitted to distinguish the Weeks by making a longer Notch than ordinary for the SabbathDay and so did not really know what any of the Days were but now having cast up the Days as above I found I had been there a Year so I divided it into Weeks and set apart every seventh Day for a Sabbath though I found at the End of my Account I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning  A little after this my Ink began to fail me and so I contented my self to use it more sparingly and to write down only the most remarkable Events of my Life without continuing a daily  Memorandum  of other Things  The rainy Season and the dry Season began now to appear regular to me and I learn'd to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly But I bought all my Experience before I had it and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging Experiments that I made at all I have mention'd that I had sav'd the few Ears of Barley and Rice which I had so surprizingly found spring up as I thought of themselves and believe there was about thirty Stalks of Rice and about twenty of Barley and now I thought it a proper Time to sow it after the Rains the Sun being in its  Southern  Position going from me  Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with my wooden Spade and dividing it into two Parts I sow'd my Grain but as I was sowing it casually occur'd to my Thoughts That I would not sow it all at first because I did not know when was the proper Time for it so I sow'd about two Thirds of the Seed leaving about a Handful of each  It was a great Comfort to me afterwards that I did so for not one Grain of that I sow'd this Time came to any Thing for the dry Months following the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown it had no Moisture to assist its Growth and never came up at all till the wet Season had come again and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown  Finding my first Seed did not grow which I easily imagin'd was by the Drought I sought for a moister Peice of Ground to make another Trial in and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower and sow'd the rest of my Seed in  February  a little before the  Vernal Equinox  and this having the rainy Months of  March  and  April  to water it sprung up very pleasantly and yielded a very good Crop but having Part of the Seed left only and not daring to sow all that I had I had but a small Quantity at last my whole Crop not amounting to above half a Peck of each kind  But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business and knew exactly when the proper Season was to sow and that I might expect two Seed Times and two Harvests every Year  While this Corn was growing I made a little Discovery which was of use to me afterwards As soon as the Rains were over and the Weather began to settle which was about the Month of  November  I made a Visit up the Country to my Bower where though I had not been some Months yet I found all Things just as I left them The Circle or double Hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire but the Stakes which I had cut out of some Trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long Branches as much as a WillowTree usually shoots the first Year after lopping its Head I could not tell what Tree to  call it that these Stakes were cut from I was surpriz'd and yet very well pleas'd to see the young Trees grow and I prun'd them and led them up to grow as much alike as I could and it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into in three Years so that though the Hedge made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Diameter yet the Trees for such I might now call them soon cover'd it and it was a compleat Shade sufficient to lodge under all the dry Season  This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle round my Wall I mean that of my first Dwelling which I did and placing the Trees or Stakes in a double Row at about eight Yards distance from my first Fence they grew presently and were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation and afterward serv'd for a Defence also as I shall observe in its Order  I found now That the Seasons of the Year might generally be divided not into  Summer  and  Winter  as in  Europe  but into the Rainy Seasons and the Dry Seasons which were generally thus  Half  February  Rainy the  Sun  being then on or near the  Equinox    March  Rainy the  Sun  being then on or near the  Equinox    Half  April  Rainy the  Sun  being then on or near the  Equinox    Half  April  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  North  of the Line  May  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  North  of the Line  June  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  North  of the Line  July  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  North  of the Line  Half  August  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  North  of the Line  Half  August  Rainy the  Sun  being then come back  September  Rainy the  Sun  being then come back  Half  October  Rainy the  Sun  being then come back  Half  October  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  South  of the Line  November  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  South  of the Line  December  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  South  of the Line  January  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  South  of the Line  Half  February  Dry the  Sun  being then to the  South  of the Line  The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter as the Winds happen'd to blow but this was the general Observation I made After I had found by Experience the ill Consequence of being abroad in the Rain I took Care to furnish my self with Provisions before hand that I might not be oblig'd to go out and I sat within Doors as much as possible during the wet Months  This Time I found much Employment and very suitable also to the Time for I found great Occasion of many Things which I had no way to furnish my self with but by hard Labour and constant Application particularly I try'd many Ways to make my self a Basket but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpose prov'd so brittle that they would do nothing It prov'd of excellent Advantage to me now That when I was a Boy I used to take great Delight in standing at a  Basketmakers  in the Town where my Father liv'd to see them make their  Wickerware  and being as Boys usually are very officious to help and a great Observer of the Manner how they work'd those Things and sometimes lending a Hand I had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods of it that I wanted nothing but the Materials when it came into my Mind That the Twigs of that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew  might possibly be as tough as the  Sallows  and  Willows  and  Osiers  in  England  and I resolv'd to try  Accordingly the next Day I went to my CountryHouse as I call'd it and cutting some of the smaller Twigs I found them to my Purpose as much as I could desire whereupon I came the next Time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a Quantity which I soon found for there was great Plenty of them these I set up to dry within my Circle or Hedge and when they were fit for Use I carry'd them to my Cave and here during the next Season I employ'd my self in making  as well as I could  a great many Baskets both to carry Earth or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had occasion and tho' I did not finish them very handsomly yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my Purpose and thus afterwards I took Care never to be without them and as my  Wickerware  decay'd I made more especially I made strong deep Baskets to place my Corn in instead of Sacks when I should come to have any Quantity of it  Having master'd this Difficulty and employ'd a World of Time about it I bestirr'd my self to see if possible how to supply two Wants I had no Vessels to hold any Thing that was Liquid except two Runlets which were almost full of Rum and some GlassBottles some of the common Size and others which were CaseBottlesSquare for the holding of Waters Spirits  c  I had not so much as a Pot to boil any Thing except a great Kettle which I sav'd out of the Ship and which was too big for such Use as I desir'd it  viz  To make Broth and stew a Bit of Meat by it self The Second Thing I would fain have had was a TobaccoPipe but it was impossible to me to  make one however I found a Contrivance for that too at last  I employ'd my self in Planting my Second Rows of Stakes or Piles and in this  Wicker  working all the Summer or dry Season when another Business took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd I could spare  I mention'd before That I had a great Mind to see the whole Island and that I had travell'd up the Brook and so on to where I built my Bower and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on the other Side of the Island I now resolv'd to travel quite Cross to the SeaShore on that Side so taking my Gun a Hatchet and my Dog and a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual with two Bisket Cakes and a great Bunch of Raisins in my Pouch for my Store I began my Journey when I had pass'd the Vale where my Bower stood as above I came within View of the Sea to the  West  and it being a very clear Day I fairly descry'd Land whether an Island or a Continent I could not tell but it lay very high extending from the  West  to the  W S W  at a very great Distance by my Guess it could not be less than Fifteen or Twenty Leagues of  I could not tell what Part of the World this might be otherwise than that I know it must be Part of  America  and as I concluded by all my Observations must be near the  Spanish  Dominions and perhaps was all Inhabited by Savages where if I should have landed I had been in a worse Condition than I was now and therefore I acquiesced in the Dispositions of Providence which I began now to own and to believe order'd every Thing for the best I say I quieted my Mind with this and left afflicting my self with Fruitless Wishes of being there  Besides after some Pause upon this Affair I consider'd that if this Land was the  Spanish  Coast I should certainly one Time or other see some Vessel pass or repass one Way or other but if not then it was the  Savage  Coast between the  Spanish  Country and  Brasils  which are indeed the worst of  Savages  for they are Cannibals or Meneaters and fail not to murther and devour all the humane Bodies that fall into their Hands  With these Considerations I walk'd very leisurely forward I found that Side of the Island where I now was much pleasanter than mine the open or  Savanna  Fields sweet adorn'd with Flowers and Grass and full of very fine Woods I saw Abundance of Parrots and fain I would have caught one if possible to have kept it to be tame and taught it to speak to me I did after some Pains taking catch a young Parrot for I knock'd it down with a Stick and having recover'd it I brought it home but it was some Years before I could make him speak However at last I taught him to call me by my Name very familiarly But the Accident that follow'd tho' it be a Trifle will be very diverting in its Place  I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey I found in the low Grounds Hares as I thought them to be and Foxes but they differ'd greatly from all the other Kinds I had met with nor could I satisfy my self to eat them tho' I kill'd several But I had no Need to be ventrous for I had no Want of Food and of that which was very good too especially these three Sorts  viz  Goats Pidgeons and Turtle or Tortoise which added to my Grapes  Leadenhall  Market could not have furnish'd a Table better than I in Proportion to the Company and tho' my Case was deplorable enough yet I had great Cause for Thankfulness  that I was not driven to any Extremities for Food but rather Plenty even to Dainties  I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day or thereabouts but I took so many Turns and Returns to see what Discoveries I could make that I came weary enough to the Place where I resolv'd to sit down for all Night and then I either repos'd my self in a Tree or surrounded my self with a Row of Stakes set upright in the Ground either from one Tree to another or so as no wild Creature could come at me without waking me  As soon as I came to the Sea Shore I was surpriz'd to see that I had taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island for here indeed the Shore was cover'd with innumerable Turtles whereas on the other Side I had found but three in a Year and half Here was also an infinite Number of Fowls of many Kinds some which I had seen and some which I had not seen of before and many of them very good Meat but such as I knew not the Names of except those call'd  Penguins    I could have shot as many as I pleas'd but was very sparing of my Powder and Shot and therefore had more Mind to kill a she Goat if I could which I could better feed on and though there were many Goats here more than on my Side the Island yet it was with much more Difficulty that I could come near them the Country being flat and even and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the Hill  I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine but yet I had not the least Inclination to remove for as I was fix'd in my Habitation it became natural to me and I seem'd all the while I was here to be as it were upon a Journey and from Home However I travell'd along  the Shore of the Sea towards the  East  I suppose about twelve Miles and then setting up a great Pole upon the Shore for a Mark I concluded I would go Home again and that the next Journey I took should be on the other Side of the Island  East  from my Dwelling and so round till I came to my Post again Of which in its Place  I took another Way to come back than that I went thinking I could easily keep all the Island so much in my View that I could not miss finding my first Dwelling by viewing the Country but I found my self mistaken for being come about two or three Miles I found my self descended into a very large Valley but so surrounded with Hills and those Hills cover'd with Wood that I could not see which was my Way by any Direction but that of the Sun nor even then unless I knew very well the Position of the Sun at that Time of the Day  It happen'd to my farther Misfortune That the Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days while I was in this Valley and not being able to see the Sun I wander'd about very uncomfortably and at last was oblig'd to find out the Sea Side look for my Post and come back the same Way I went and then by easy Journies I turn'd Homeward the Weather being exceeding hot and my Gun Ammunition Hatchet and other Things very heavy  In this Journey my Dog surpriz'd a young Kid and seiz'd upon it and I running in to take hold of it caught it and sav'd it alive from the Dog I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could for I had often been musing Whether it might not be possible to get a Kid or two and so raise a Breed of tame Goats which might supply me when my Powder and Shot should be all spent  I made a Collar to this little Creature and with a String which I made of some RopeYarn which I always carry'd about me I led him along tho' with some Difficulty till I came to my Bower and there I enclos'd him and left him for I was very impatient to be at Home from whence I had been absent above a Month  I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me to come into my old Hutch and lye down in my HamockBed This little wandring Journey without settled Place of Abode had been so unpleasant to me that my own House as I call'd it to my self was a perfect Settlement to me compar'd to that and it rendred every Thing about me so comfortable that I resolv'd I would never go a great Way from it again while it should be my Lot to stay on the Island  I repos'd my self here a Week to rest and regale my self after my long Journey during which most of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of making a Cage for my Poll who began now to be a meer Domestick and to be mighty well acquainted with me Then I began to think of the poor Kid which I had penn'd in within my little Circle and resolv'd to go and fetch it Home or give it some Food accordingly I went and found it where I left it for indeed it could not get out but almost starv'd for want of Food I went and cut Bows of Trees and Branches of such Shrubs as I could find and threw it over and having fed it I ty'd it as I did before to lead it away but it was so tame with being hungry that I had no need to have ty'd it for it follow'd me like a Dog and as I continually fed it the Creature became so loving so gentle and so fond that it became from that Time one of my Domesticks also and would never leave me afterwards  The rainy Season of the  Autumnal Equinox  was now come and I kept the th of  Sept  in the same solemn Manner as before being the Anniversary of my Landing on the Island having now been there two Years and no more Prospect of being deliver'd than the first Day I came there I spent the whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledgments of the many wonderful Mercies which my Solitary Condition was attended with and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had been pleas'd to discover to me even that it was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition than I should have been in a Liberty of Society and in all the Pleasures of the World That he could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of my Solitary State and the want of Humane Society by his Presence and the Communications of his Grace to my Soul supporting comforting and encouraging me to depend upon his Providence here and hope for his Eternal Presence hereafter  It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this Life I now led was with all its miserable Circumstances than the wicked cursed abominable Life I led all the past Part of my Days and now I chang'd both my Sorrows and my Joys my very Desires alter'd my Affections chang'd their Gusts and my Delights were perfectly new from what they were at my first Coming or indeed for the two Years past  Before as I walk'd about either on my Hunting or for viewing the Country the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition would break out upon me on a sudden and my very Heart would die within me to think of the Woods the Mountains the Desarts I was in and how I was a Prisoner lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the  Ocean in an uninhabited Wilderness without Redemption In the midst of the greatest Composures of my Mind this would break out upon me like a Storm and make me wring my Hands and weep like a Child Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my Work and I would immediately sit down and sigh and look upon the Ground for an Hour or two together and this was still worse to me for if I could burst out into Tears or vent my self by Words it would go off and the Grief having exhausted it self would abate  But now I began to exercise my self with new Thoughts I daily read the Word of God and apply'd all the Comforts of it to my present State One Morning being very sad I open'd the Bible upon these Words  I will never never leave thee nor forsake thee  immediately it occurr'd That these Words were to me Why else should they be directed in such a Manner just at the Moment when I was mourning over my Condition as one forsaken of God and Man Well then said I if God does not forsake me of what ill Consequence can it be or what matters it though the World should all forsake me seeing on the other Hand if I had all the World and should lose the Favour and Blessing of God there wou'd be no Comparison in the Loss  From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind That it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition than it was probable I should ever have been in any other Particular State in the World and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for bringing me to this Place  I know not what it was but something shock'd my Mind at that Thought and I durst not speak the Words How canst thou be sueh a Hypocrite  said I even audibly to pretend to be thankful for a Condition which however thou may'st endeavour to be contented with thou would'st rather pray heartily to be deliver'd from so I stopp'd there But though I could not say I thank'd God for being there yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God for opening my Eyes by whatever afflicting Providences to see the former Condition of my Life and to mourn for my Wickedness and repent I never open'd the Bible or shut it but my very Soul within me bless'd God for directing my Friend in  England  without any Order of mine to pack it up among my Goods and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the Wreck of the Ship  Thus and in this Disposition of Mind I began my third Year and tho' I have not given the Reader the Trouble of so particular Account of my Works this Year as the first yet in General it may be observ'd That I was very seldom idle but having regularly divided my Time according to the several daily Employments that were before me such as  First  My Duty to God and the Reading the Scriptures which I constantly set apart some Time for thrice every Day  Secondly  The going Abroad with my Gun for Food which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning when it did not Rain  Thirdly  The ordering curing preserving and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd for my Supply these took up great Part of the Day also it is to be considered that the middle of the Day when the Sun was in the  Zenith  the Violence of the Heat was too great to stir out so that about four Hours in the Evening was all the Time I could be suppos'd to work in with this Exception That sometimes I chang'd my Hours of Hunting and Working and went to work in the  Morning and Abroad with my Gun in the Afternoon  To this short Time allow'd for Labour I desire may be added the exceeding Laboriousness of my Work the many Hours which for want of Tools want of Help and want of Skill every Thing I did took up out of my Time For Example I was full two and forty Days making me a Board for a long Shelf which I wanted in my Cave whereas two Sawyers with their Tools and a SawPit would have cut six of them out of the same Tree in half a Day  My Case was this It was to be a large Tree which was to be cut down because my Board was to be a broad one This Tree I was three Days a cutting down and two more cutting off the Bows and reducing it to a Log or Piece of Timber With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips till it begun to be light enough to move than I turn'd it and made one Side of it smooth and flat as a Board from End to End then turning that Side downward cut the other Side till I brought the Plank to be about three Inches thick and smooth on both Sides Any one may judge the Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work but Labour and Patience carry'd me through that and many other Things I only observe this in Particular to shew The Reason why so much of my Time went away with so little Work  viz  That what might be a little to be done with Help and Tools was a vast Labour and requir'd a prodigious Time to do alone and by hand  But notwithstanding this with Patience and Labour I went through many Things and indeed every Thing that my Circumstances made necessary to me to do as will appear by what follows  I was now in the Months of  November  and  December  expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them was not great for as I observ'd my Seed of each was not above the Quantity of half a Peck for I had lost one whole Crop by sowing in the dry Season but now my Crop promis'd very well when on a sudden I found I was in Danger of losing it all again by Enemies of several Sorts which it was scarce possible to keep from it as First The Goats and wild Creatures which I call'd Hares who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade lay in it Night and Day as soon as it came up and eat it so close that it could get no Time to shoot up into Stalk  This I saw no Remedy for but by making an Enclosure about it with a Hedge which I did with a great deal of Toil and the more because it requir'd Speed However as my Arable Land was but small suited to my Crop I got it totally well fenc'd in about three Weeks Time and shooting some of the Creatures in the Day Time I set my Dog to guard it in the Night tying him up to a Stake at the Gate where he would stand and bark all Night long so in a little Time the Enemies forsook the Place and the Corn grew very strong and well and began to ripen apace  But as the Beasts ruined me before while my Corn was in the Blade so the Birds were as likely to ruin me now when it was in the Ear for going along by the Place to see how it throve I saw my little Crop surrounded with Fowls of I know not how many sorts who stood as it were watching till I should be gone I immediately let fly among them for I always had my Gun with me I had no sooner shot but there rose up a a little  Cloud of Fowls which I had not seen at all from among the Corn it self  This touch'd me sensibly for I foresaw that in a few Days they would devour all my Hopes that I should be starv'd and never be able to raise a Crop at all and what to do I could not tell However I resolv'd not to loose my Corn if possible tho' I should watch it Night and Day In the first Place I went among it to see what Damage was already done and found they had spoil'd a good deal of it but that as it was yet too Green for them the Loss was not so great but that the Remainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be sav'd  I staid by it to load my Gun and then coming away I could easily see the Thieves sitting upon all the Trees about me as if they only waited till I was gone away and the Event proved it to be so for as I walk'd off as if I was gone I was no sooner out of their sight but they dropt down one by one into the Corn again I was so provok'd that I could not have Patience to stay till more came on knowing that every Grain that they eat now was  as it might be said  a Peckloaf to me in the Consequence but coming up to the Hedge I fir'd again and kill'd three of them This was what I wish'd for so I took them up and serv'd them as we serve notorious Thieves in  England viz  Hang'd them in Chains for a Terror to others it is impossible to imagine almost that this should have such an Effect as it had for the Fowls wou'd not only not come at the Corn but in short they forsook all that Part of the Island and I could never see a Bird near the Place as long as my ScareCrows hung there  This I was very glad of you may be sure and about the latter end of  December  which was our second Harvest of the Year I reap'd my Crop  I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sicle to cut it down and all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the Broad Swords or Cutlasses which I sav'd among the Arms out of the Ship However as my first Crop was but small I had no great Difficulty to cut it down in short I reap'd it my Way for I cut nothing off but the Ears and carry'd it away in a great Basket which I had made and so rubb'd it out with my Hands and at the End of all my Harvesting I found that out of my half Peck of Seed I had near two Bushels of Rice and above two Bushels and half of Barley  that is to say  by my Guess for I had no Measure at that time  However this was a great Encouragement to me and I foresaw that in time it wou'd please God to supply me with Bread And yet here I was perplex'd again for I neither knew how to grind or make Meal of my Corn or indeed how to clean it and part it nor if made into Meal how to make Bread of it and if how to make it yet I knew not how to bake it these things being added to my Desire of having a good Quantity for Store and to secure a constant Supply I resolv'd not to taste any of this Crop but to preserve it all for Seed against the next Season and in the mean time to employ all my Study and Hours of Working to accomplish this great Work of Providing my self with Corn and Bread  It might be truly said that now I work'd for my Bread 'tis a little wonderful and what I believe few People have thought much upon  viz  the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the  Providing Producing Curing Dressing Making and Finishing this one Article of Bread  I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature found this to my daily Discouragement and was made more and more sensible of it every Hour even after I had got the first Handful of SeedCorn which as I have said came up unexpectedly and indeed to a surprize  First I had no Plow to turn up the Earth no Spade or Shovel to dig it Well this I conquer'd by making a wooden Spade as I observ'd before but this did my Work in but a wooden manner and tho' it cost me a great many Days to make it yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the sooner but made my Work the harder and made it be perform'd much worse  However this I bore with and was content to work it out with Patience and bear with the badness of the Performance When the Corn was sow'd I had no Harrow but was forced to go over it my self and drag a great heavy Bough of a Tree over it to Scratch it as it may be call'd rather than Rake or Harrow it  When it was growing and grown I have observ'd already how many things I wanted to Fence it Secure it Mow or Reap it Cure and Carry it Home Thrash Part it from the Chaff and Save it Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it Sieves to Dress it Yeast and Salt to make it into Bread and an Oven to bake it and yet all these things I did without as shall be observ'd and yet the Corn was an inestimable Comfort and Advantage to me too All this as I said made every thing laborious and tedious to me but that there was no help for neither was my time so much Loss to me because as I had divided it a certain Part of it was every Day appointed to  these Works and as I resolv'd to use none of the Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by me I had the next six Months to apply my self wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish my self with Utensils proper for the performing all the Operations necessary for the making the Corn when I had it fit for my use  But first I was to prepare more Land for I had now Seed enough to sow above an Acre of Ground Before I did this I had a Weekswork at least to make me a Spade which when it was done was but a sorry one indeed and very heavy and requir'd double Labour to work with it however I went thro' that and sow'd my Seed in two large flat Pieces of Ground as near my House as I could find them to my Mind and fenc'd them in with a good Hedge the Stakes of which were all cut of that Wood which I had set before and knew it would grow so that in one Year's time I knew I should have a Quick or LivingHedge that would want but little Repair This Work was not so little as to take me up less than three Months because great Part of that time was of the wet Season when I could not go abroad  Within Doors  that is  when it rained and I could not go out I found Employment on the following Occasions always observing that all the while I was at work I diverted my self with talking to my Parrot and teaching him to Speak and I quickly learn'd him to know his own Name and at last to speak it out pretty loud POLL which was the first Word I ever heard spoken in the Island by any Mouth but my own This therefore was not my Work but an assistant to my Work for now as I said I had a great Employment upon my Hands as follows  viz  I had  long study'd by some Means or other to make my self some Earthen Vessels which indeed I wanted sorely but knew not where to come at them However considering the Heat of the Climate I did not doubt but if I could find out any such Clay I might botch up some such Pot as might being dry'd in the Sun be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling and to hold any Thing that was dry and requir'd to be kept so and as this was necessary in the preparing Corn Meal  c  which was the Thing I was upon I resolv'd to make some as large as I could and fit only to stand like Jarrs to hold what should be put into them  It would make the Reader pity me or rather laugh at me to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this Paste what odd mishapen ugly things I made how many of them fell in and how many fell out the Clay not being stiff enough to bear its own Weight how many crack'd by the over violent Heat of the Sun being set out too hastily and how many fell in pieces with only removing as well before as after they were dry'd and in a word how after having labour'd hard to find the Clay to dig it to temper it to bring it home and work it I could not make above two large earthen ugly things I cannot call them Jarrs in about two Months Labour  However as the Sun bak'd these Two very dry and hard I lifted them very gently up and set them down again in two great WickerBaskets which I had made on purpose for them that they might not break and as between the Pot and the Basket there was a little room to spare I stuff'd it full of the Rice and Barley Straw and these two Pots being to stand always dry I thought would  hold my dry Corn and perhaps the Meal when the Corn was bruised  Tho' I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots yet I made several smaller things with better Success such as little round Pots flat Dishes Pitchers and Pipkins and any things my Hand turn'd to and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them strangely hard  But all this would not answer my End which was to get an earthen Pot to hold what was Liquid and bear the Fire which none of these could do It happen'd after some time making a pretty large Fire for cooking my Meat when I went to put it out after I had done with it I found a broken Piece of one of my Earthenware Vessels in the Fire burnt as hard as a Stone and red as a Tile I was agreeably suppris'd to see it and said to my self that certainly they might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken  This set me to studying how to order my Fire so as to make it burn me some Pots I had no Notion of a Kiln such as the Potters burn in or of glazing them with Lead tho' I had some Lead to do it with but I plac'd three large Pipkins and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another and plac'd my Firewood all round it with a great Heap of Embers under them I ply'd the Fire with fresh Fuel round the outside and upon the top till I saw the Pots in the inside red hot quite thro' and observ'd that they did not crack at all when I saw them clear red I let them stand in that Heat abour or Hours till I found one of them tho' it did not crack did melt or run for the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted by the violence of the Heat and would have run into Glass if I had gone on so I slack'd my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red  Colour and watching them all Night that I might not let the Fire abate too fast in the Morning I had three very good I will not say handsome Pipkins and two other Earthen Pots as hard burnt as cou'd be desir'd and one of them perfectly glaz'd with the Running of the Sand  After this Experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of Earthen Ware for my Use but I must needs say as to the Shapes of them they were very indifferent as any one may suppose when I had no way of making them but as the Children make DirtPies or as a Woman would make Pies that never learn'd to raise Past  No Joy at a Thing of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine when I found I had made an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire and I had hardly Patience to stay till they were cold before I set one upon the Fire again with some Water in it to boil me some Meat which it did admirably well and with a Piece of a Kid I made some very good Broth though I wanted Oatmeal and several other Ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would have had it been  My next Concern was to get me a Stone Mortar to stamp or beat some Corn in for as to the Mill there was no thought at arriving to that Perfection of Art with one Pair of Hands To supply this Want I was at a great Loss for of all Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualify'd for a Stonecutter as for any whatever neither had I any Tools to go about it with I spent many a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for a Mortar and could find none at all except what was in the solid Rock and which I had no way to dig or cut out nor indeed were the Rocks in the Island of Hardness sufficient but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone  which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy Pestle or would break the Corn without filling it with Sand so after a great deal of Time lost in searching for a Stone I gave it over and resolv'd to look out for a great Block of hard Wood which I found indeed much easier and getting one as big as I had Strength to stir I rounded it and form'd it in the Outside with my Axe and Hatchet and then with the Help of Fire and infinite Labour made a hollow Place in it as the  Indians  in  Brasil  make their  Canoes  After this I made a great heavy Pestle or Beater of the Wood call'd the Ironwood and this I prepar'd and laid by against I had my next Crop of Corn when I propos'd to my self to grind or rather pound my Corn into Meal to make my Bread  My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve or Search to dress my Meal and to part it from the Bran and the Husk without which I did not see it possible I could have any Bread This was a most difficult Thing so much as but to think on for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary Thing to make it I mean fine thin Canvas or Stuff to search the Meal through And here I was at a full Stop for many Months nor did I really know what to do Linnen I had none left but what was meer Rags I had Goats Hair but neither knew I how to weave it or spin it and had I known how here was no Tools to work it with all the Remedy that I found for this was That at last I did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths which were sav'd out of the Ship some Neckcloths of Callicoe or Muslin and with some Pieces of these I made three small Sieves but proper enough for the Work and thus I made shift for some Years how I did afterwards I shall shew in its Place  The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider'd and how I should make Bread when I came to have Corn for first I had no Yeast as to that Part as there was no supplying the Want so I did not concern my self much about it But for an Oven I was indeed in great Pain at length I found out an Experiment for that also which was this I made some Earthen Vessels very broad but not deep that is to say about two Foot Diameter and not above nine Inches deep these I burnt in the Fire as I had done the other and laid them by and when I wanted to bake I made a great Fire upon my Hearth which I had pav'd with some square Tiles of my own making and burning also but I should not call them square  When the Firewood was burnt pretty much into Embers or live Coals I drew them forward upon this Hearth so as to cover it all over and there I let them lye till the Hearth was very hot then sweeping away all the Embers I set down my Loaf or Loaves and whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them drew the Embers all round the Outside of the Pot to keep in and add to the Heat and thus as well as in the best Oven in the World I bak'd my Barley Loaves and became in little Time a meer PastryCook into the Bargain for I made my self several Cakes of the Rice and Puddings indeed I made no Pies neither had I any Thing to put into them supposing I had except the Flesh either of Fowls or Goats  It need not be wondred at if all these Things took me up most Part of the third Year of my Abode here for it is to be observ'd That in the Intervals of these Things I had my new Harvest and Husbandry to manage for I reap'd my Corn in its Season and carry'd it Home as well as I could and laid it up in the Ear in my large Baskets till I had  Time to rub it out for I had no Floor to thrash it on or Instrument to thrash it with  And now indeed my Stock of Corn increasing I really wanted to build my Barns bigger I wanted a Place to lay it up in for the Increase of the Corn now yielded me so much that I had of the Barley about twenty Bushels and of the Rice as much or more insomuch that now I resolv'd to begin to use it freely for my Bread had been quite gone a great while Also I resolved to see what Quantity would be sufficient for me a whole Year and to sow but once a Year  Upon the whole I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice was much more than I could consume in a Year so I resolv'd to sow just the same Quantity every Year that I sow'd the last in Hopes that such a Quantity would fully provide me with Bread  c  All the while these Things were doing you may be sure my Thoughts run many times upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the other Side of the Island and I was not without secret Wishes that I were on Shore there fancying the seeing the main Land and in an inhabited Country I might find some Way or other to convey my self farther and perhaps at last find some Means of Escape  But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a Condition and how I might fall into the Hands of Savages and perhaps such as I might have Reason to think far worse than the Lions and Tigers of  Africa  That if I once came into their Power I should run a Hazard more than a thousand to one of being kill'd and perhaps of being eaten for I had heard that the People of the  Carribean  Coast were Canibals or Maneaters and I knew by the Latiude that I could not be far off  from that Shore That suppose they were not Canibals yet that they might kill me as many  Europeans  who had fallen into their Hands had been serv'd even when they had been ten or twenty together much more I that was but one and could make little or no Defence All these Things I say which I ought to have consider'd well of and did cast up in my Thoughts afterwards yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first but my Head run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore  Now I wish'd for my Boy  Xury  and the long Boat with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail with which I sail'd above a thousand Miles on the Coast of  Africk  but this was in vain Then I thought I would go and look at our Ship's Boat which as I have said was blown up upon the Shore a great Way in the Storm when we were first cast away She lay almost where she did at first but not quite and was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the Winds almost Bottom upward against a high Ridge of Beachy rough Sand but no Water about her as before  If I had had Hands to have refitted her and to have launch'd her into the Water the Boat would have done well enough and I might have gone back into the  Brasils  with her easily enough but I might have foreseen That I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her Bottom than I could remove the Island However I went to the Woods and cut Levers and Rollers and brought them to the Boat resolv'd to try what I could do suggesting to my self That I if could but turn her down I might easily repair the Damage she had receiv'd and she would be a very good Boat and I might go to Sea in her very easily  I spar'd no Pains indeed in this Piece of fruitless Toil and spent I think three or four Weeks about  it at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little Strength I fell to digging away the Sand to undermine it and so to make it fall down setting Pieces of Wood to thrust and guide it right in the Fall  But when I had done this I was unable to stir it up again or to get under it much less to move it forward towards the Water so I was forc'd to give it over and yet though I gave over the Hopes of the Boat my desire to venture over for the Main increased rather than decreased as the Means for it seem'd impossible  This at length put me upon thinking Whether it was not possible to make my self a  Canoe  or  Periagua  such as the Natives of those Climates make even without Tools or as I might say without Hands  viz  of the Trunk of a great Tree This I not only thought possible but easy and pleas'd my self extreamly with the Thoughts of making it and with my having much more Convenience for it than any of the  Negroes  or  Indians  but not at all considering the particular Inconveniences which I lay under more than the  Indians  did  viz  Want of Hands to move it when it was made into the Water a Difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the Consequences of Want of Tools could be to them for what was it to me That when I had chosen a vast Tree in the Woods I might with much Trouble cut it down if after I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the Outside into the proper Shape of a Boat and burn or cut out the Inside to make it hollow so to make a Boat of it If after all this I must leave it just there where I found it and was not able to launch it into the Water  One would have thought I could not have had the least Reflection upon my Mind of my Circumstance  while I was making this Boat but I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the Sea but my Thoughts were so intent upon my Voyage over the Sea in it that I never once consider'd how I should get it off of the Land and it was really in its own Nature more easy for me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea than about forty five Fathom of Land where it lay to set it a float in the Water  I went to work upon this Boat the most like a Fool that ever Man did who had any of his Senses awake I pleas'd my self with the Design without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it not but that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often into my Head but I put a stop to my own Enquiries into it by this foolish Answer which I gave my self  Let's first make it I'll warrant I'll find some Way or other to get it along when 'tis done    This was a most preposterous Method but the Eagerness of my Fancy prevail'd and to work I went I fell'd a Cedar Tree I question much whether  Solomon  ever had such a One for the Building of the Temple at  Jerusalem  It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the Stump and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at the End of twenty two Foot after which it lessen'd for a while and then parted into Branches It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd this Tree I was twenty Days hacking and hewing at it at the Bottom I was fourteen more getting the Branches and Limbs and the vast spreading Head of it cut off which I hack'd and hew'd through with Axe and Hatchet and inexpressible Labour After this it cost me a Month to shape it and dub it to a Proportion and to something like the Bottom of a Boat that it might swim upright  as it ought to do It cost me near three Months more to clear the Inside and work it out so as to make an exact Boat of it This I did indeed without Fire by meer Malett and Chissel and by the dint of hard Labour till I had brought it to be a very handsome  Periagua  and big enough to have carry'd six and twenty Men and consequently big enough to have carry'd me and all my Cargo  When I had gone through this Work I was extremely delighted with it The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a  Canoe  or  Periagua  that was made of one Tree in my Life Many a weary Stroke it had cost you may be sure and there remain'd nothing but to get it into the Water and had I gotten it into the Water I make no question but I should have began the maddest Voyage and the most unlikely to be perform'd that ever was undertaken  But all my Devices to get it into the Water fail'd me tho' they cost me infinite Labour too It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water and not more But the first Inconvenience was it was up Hill towards the Creek well to take away this Discouragement I resolv'd to dig into the Surface of the Earth and so make a Declivity This I begun and it cost me a prodigious deal of Pains but who grutches Pains that have their Deliverance in View But when this was work'd through and this Difficulty manag'd it was still much at one for I could no more stir the  Canoe  than I could the other Boat  Then I measur'd the Distance of Ground and resolv'd to cut a Dock or Canal to bring the Water up to the  Canoe  seeing I could not bring the  Canoe  down to the Water Well I began this Work and when I began to enter into it and calculate how deep it was to be dug how broad  how the Stuff to be thrown out I found That by the Number of Hands I had being none but my own it must have been ten or twelve Years before I should have gone through with it for the Shore lay high so that at the upper End it must have been at least twenty Foot Deep so at length tho' with great Reluctancy I gave this Attempt over also  This griev'd me heartily and now I saw tho' too late the Folly of beginning a Work before we count the Cost and before we judge rightly of our own Strength to go through with it  In the middle of this Work I finish'd my fourth Year in this Place and kept my Anniversary with the same Devotion and with as much Comfort as ever before for by a constant Study and serious Application of the Word of God and by the Assistance of his Grace I gain'd a different Knowledge from what I had before I entertain'd different Notions of Things I look'd now upon the World as a Thing remote which I had nothing to do with no Expectation from and indeed no Desires about In a Word I had nothing indeed to do with it nor was ever like to have so I thought it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter  viz  as a Place I had liv'd in but was come out of it and well might I say as Father  Abraham  to  Dives Between me and thee is a great Gulph fix'd    In the first Place I was remov'd from all the Wickedness of the World here I had neither the  Lust of the Flesh the Lust of the Eye or the Pride of Life  I had nothing to covet for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying I was Lord of the whole Mannor or if I pleas'd I might call my self King or Emperor over the whole Country which I had Possession of There were no Rivals I had no Competitor none to dispute Sovereignty or  Command with me I might have rais'd Ship Loadings of Corn but I had no use for it so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my Occasion I had Tortoise or Turtles enough but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships I had Grapes enough to have made Wine or to have cur'd into Raisins to have loaded that Fleet when they had been built  But all I could make use of was All that was valuable I had enough to eat and to supply my Wants and what was all the rest to me If I kill'd more Flesh than I could eat the Dog must eat it or the Vermin If I sow'd more Corn than I could eat it must be spoil'd The Trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the Ground I could make no more use of them than for Fewel and that I had no Occasion for but to dress my Food  In a Word The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me upon just Reflection That all the good Things of this World are no farther good to us than they are for our Use and that whatever we may heap up indeed to give others we enjoy just as much as we can use and no more The most covetous griping Miser in the World would have been cur'd of the Vice of Covetousness if he had been in my Case for I possess'd infinitely more than I knew what to do with I had no room for Desire except it was of Things which I had not and they were but Trifles though indeed of great Use to me I had as I hinted before a Parcel of Money as well Gold as Silver about thirty six Pounds Sterling Alas There the nasty sorry useless Stuff lay I had no manner of Business for it and I often thought with my self That I would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of  TobaccoPipes or for a HandMill to grind my Corn nay I would have given it all for Sixpennyworth of  Turnip  and  Carrot  Seed out of  England  or for a Handful of  Pease  and  Beans  and a Bottle of Ink  As it was  I had not the least Advantage by it or Benefit from it but there it lay in a Drawer and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave in the wet Season and if I had had the Drawer full of Diamonds it had been the same Case and they had been of no manner of Value to me because of no Use  I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in it self than it was at first and much easier to my Mind as well as to my Body I frequently sat down to my Meat with Thankfulness and admir'd the Hand of God's Providence which had thus spread my Table in the Wilderness I learn'd to look more upon the bright Side of my Condition and less upon the dark Side and to consider what I enjoy'd rather than what I wanted and this gave me sometimes such secret Comforts that I cannot express them and which I take Notice of here to put those discontented People in Mind of it who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them because they see and covet something that he has not given them All our Discontents about what we want appear'd to me to spring from the Want of Thankfulness for what we have  Another Reflection was of great Use to me and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such Distress as mine was and this was To compare my present Condition with what I at first expected it should be nay with what it would certainly have been if the good Providence of God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship to be cast up nearer to the Shore where I not only could  come at her but could bring what I got out of her to the Shore for my Relief and Comfort without which I had wanted for Tools to work Weapons for Defence or GunPowder and Shot for getting my Food  I spent whole Hours I may say whole Days in representing to my self in the most lively Colours how I must have acted if I had got nothing out of the Ship How I could not have so much as got any Food except Fish and Turtles and that as it was long before I found any of them I must have perish'd first That I should have liv'd if I had not perish'd like a meer Savage That if I had kill'd a Goat or a Fowl by any Contrivance I had no way to flea or open them or part the Flesh from the Skin and the Bowels or to cut it up but must gnaw it with my Teeth and pull it with my Claws like a Beast  These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Providence to me and very thankful for my present Condition with all its Hardships and Misfortunes And this Part also I cannot but recommend to the Reflection of those who are apt in their Misery to say  Is any Affliction like mine  Let them consider How much worse the Cases of some People are and their Case might have been if Providence had thought fit  I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my Mind with Hopes and this was comparing my present Condition with what I had deserv'd and had therefore Reason to expect from the Hand of Providence I had liv'd a dreadful Life perfectly destitute of the Knowledge and Fear of God I had been well instructed by Father and Mother neither had they been wanting to me in their early Endeavours to infuse a religious Awe of God into my Mind a Sense of my Duty and  of what the Nature and End of my Being requir'd of me But alas falling early into the Seafaring Life which of all the Lives is the most destitute of the Fear of God though his Terrors are always before them I say falling early into the Seafaring Life and into Seafaring Company all that little Sense of Religion which I had entertain'd was laugh'd out of me by my MessMates by a harden'd despising of Dangers and the Views of Death which grew habitual to me by my long Absence from all Manner of Opportunities to converse with any thing but what was like my self or to hear any thing that was good or tended towards it  So void was I of every Thing that was good or of the least Sense of what I was or was to be that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd such as my Escape from  Sallee  my being taken up by the  Portuguese  Master of the Ship my being planted so well in the  Brasils  my receiving the Cargo from  England  and the like I never had once the Word  Thank God  so much as on my Mind or in my Mouth nor in the greatest Distress had I so much as a Thought to pray to him or so much as to say  Lord have Mercy upon me  no nor to mention the Name of God unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it  I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months as I have already observ'd on the Account of my wicked and hardned Life past and when I look'd about me and considered what particular Providences had attended me since my coming into this Place and how God had dealt bountifully with me had not only punished me less than my Iniquity had deserv'd but had so plentifully provided for me this gave me great hopes that my  Repentance was accepted and that God had yet Mercy in store for me  With these Reflections I work'd my Mind up not only to Resignation to the Will of God in the present Disposition of my Circumstances but even to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition and that I who was yet a living Man ought not to complain seeing I had not the due Punishment of my Sins that I enjoy'd so many Mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that Place that I ought never more to repine at my Condition but to rejoyce and to give daily Thanks for that daily Bread which nothing but a Croud of Wonders could have brought That I ought to consider I had been fed even by Miracle even as great as that of feeding  Elijah  by Ravens nay by a long Series of Miracles and that I could hardly have nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I could have been cast more to my Advantage A Place where as I had no Society which was my Affliction on one Hand so I found no ravenous Beast no furious Wolves or Tygers to threaten my Life no venomous Creatures or poisonous which I might feed on to my Hurt no Savages to murther and devour me  In a word as my Life was a Life of Sorrow one way so it was a Life of Mercy another and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort but to be able to make my Sence of God's Goodness to me and Care over me in this Condition be my daily Consolation and after I did make a just Improvement of these things I went away and was no more sad  I had now been here so long that many Things which I brought on Shore for my Help were either quite gone or very much wasted and near spent  My Ink as I observed had been gone some time all but a very little which I eek'd out with Water a little and a little till it was so pale it scarce left any Appearance of black upon the Paper As long as it lasted I made use of it to minuite down the Days of the Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to me and first by casting up Times past I remember that there was a strange Concurrence of Days in the various Providences which befel me and which if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe Days as Fatal or Fortunate I might have had Reason to have look'd upon with a great deal of Curiosity  First I had observed that the same Day that I broke away from my Father and my Friends and run away to  Hull  in order to go to Sea the same Day afterwards I was taken by the Sally Man of War and made a Slave  The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that Ship in  Yarmouth  Rodes that same DayYear afterwards I made my escape from  Sallee  in the Boat  The same Day of the Year I was born on  viz  the  th  of  September  that same Day I had my Life so miraculously saved Year after when I was cast on Shore in this Island so that my wicked Life and my solitary Life begun both on a Day  The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted was that of my Bread I mean the Bisket which I brought out of the Ship this I had husbanded to the last degree allowing my self but one Cake of Bread a Day for above a Year and yet I was quite without Bread for near a Year before I got any Corn of my own and great Reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all the getting it being as has been already observed next to miraculous  My Cloaths began to decay too mightily As to Linnen I had had none a good while except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in the Chests of the other Seamen and which I carefully preserved because many times I could bear no other Cloaths on but a Shirt and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the Men's Cloaths of the Ship almost three dozen of Shirts There were also several thick Watch Coats of the Seamens which were left indeed but they were too hot to wear and tho' it is true that the Weather was so violent hot that there was no need of Cloaths yet I could not go quite naked no tho' I had been inclin'd to it which I was not nor could not abide the thoughts of it tho' I was all alone  The Reason why I could not go quite naked was I could not bear the heat of the Sun so well when quite naked as with some Cloaths on nay the very Heat frequently blistered my Skin whereas with a Shirt on the Air itself made some Motion and whistling under that Shirt was twofold cooler than without it no more could I ever bring my self to go out in the heat of Sun without a Cap or a Hat the heat of the Sun beating with such Violence as it does in that Place would give me the Headach presently by darting so directly on my Head without a Cap or Hat on so that I could not bear it whereas if I put on my Hat it would presently go away  Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few Rags I had which I call'd Cloaths into some Order I had worn out all the Wastcoats I had and my Business was now to try if I could not make Jackets out of the great WatchCoats which I had by me and with such other Materials as I had so I set to Work a Taylering or rather indeed a Botching for I made most  piteous Work of it However I made shift to make two or three new Wastcoats which I hoped wou'd serve me a great while as for Breeches or Drawers I made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward  I have mentioned that I saved the Skins of all the Creatures that I kill'd I mean fourfooted ones and I had hung them up stretch'd out with Sticks in the Sun by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little but others it seems were very useful The first thing I made of these was a great Cap for my Head with the Hair on the out Side to shoor off the Rain and this I perform'd so well that after this I made me a Suit of Cloaths wholly of these Skins that is to say a Wastcoat and Breeches open at Knees and both loose for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm I must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made for if I was a bad  Carpenter  I was a worse  Tayler  However they were such as I made very good shift with and when I was abroad if it happen'd to rain the Hair of my Wastcoat and Cap being outermost I was kept very dry  After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an Umbrella I was indeed in great want of one and had a great Mind to make one I had seen them made in the  Brasils  where they are very useful in the great Heats which are there And I felt the Heats every jot as great here and greater too being nearer the Equinox besides as I was oblig'd to be much abroad it was a most useful thing to me as well for the Rains as the Heats I took a world of Pains at it and was a great while before I could make any thing likely to hold nay after I thought I had hit the Way I spoil'd or before I made one to my Mind but  at last I made one that aswer'd indifferently well The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let down I could make it to spread but if it did not let down too and draw in it was not portable for me any Way but just over my Head which wou'd not do However at last as I said I made one to answer and covered it with Skins the Hair upwards so that it cast off the Rains like a Penthouse and kept off the Sun so effectually that I could walk out in the hottest of the Weather with greater Advantage than I could before in the coolest and when I had no need of it cou'd close it and carry it under my Arm  Thus I liv'd mighty comfortably my Mind being entirely composed by resigning to the Will of God and throwing my self wholly upon the Disposal of his Providence This made my Life better than sociable for when I began to regret the want of Conversation I would ask my self whether thus conversing mutually with my own Thoughts and as I hope I may say with even God himself by Ejaculations was not better than the utmost Enjoyment of humane Society in the World  I cannot say that after this for five Years any extraordinary thing happened to me but I liv'd on in the same Course in the same Posture and Place just as before the chief things I was employ'd in besides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice and curing my Raisins of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient Stock of one Year's Provisions beforehand I say besides this yearly Labour and my daily Labour of going out with my Gun I had one Labour to make me a Canoe which at last I finished So that by digging a Canal to it of six Foot wide and four Foot deep I brought it into the Creek almost half a Mile As for the first which was so vastly big  as I made it without considering beforehand as I ought to do how I should be able to launch it so never being able to bring it to the Water or bring the Water to it I was oblig'd to let it lye where it was as a  Memorandum  to teach me to be wiser next Time Indeed the next Time tho' I could not get a Tree proper for it and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it at any less Distance than as I have said near half a Mile yet as I saw it was practicable at last I never gave it over and though I was near two Years about it yet I never grutch'd my Labour in Hopes of having a Boat to go off to Sea at last  However though my little  Periagau  was finish'd yet the Size of it was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View when I made the first I mean Of venturing over to the  Terra Firma  where it was above forty Miles broad accordingly the Smallness of my Boat assisted to put an End to that Design and now I thought no more of it But as I had a Boat my next Design was to make a Tour round the Island for as I had been on the other Side in one Place crossing as I have already describ'd it over the Land so the Discoveries I made in that little Journey made me very eager to see other Parts of the Coast and now I had a Boat I thought of nothing but sailing round the Island  For this Purpose that I might do every Thing with Discretion and Consideration I fitted up a little Mast to my Boat and made a Sail to it out of some of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail which lay in store and of which I had a great Stock by me  Having fitted my Mast and Sail and try'd the Boat I found she would sail very well Then I made little Lockers or Boxes at either End of my Boat to put Provisions Necessaries and Ammunition  c  into to be kept dry either from Rain or the Sprye of the Sea and a little long hollow Place I cut in the Inside of the Boat where I could lay my Gun making a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry  I fix'd my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern like a Mast to stand over my Head and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning and thus I every now and then took a little Voyage upon the Sea but never went far out nor far from the little Creek but at last being eager to view the Circumference of my little Kingdom I resolv'd upon my Tour and accordingly I victuall'd my Ship for the Voyage putting in two Dozen of my Loaves Cakes I should rather call them of Barley Bread an Earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice a Food I eat a great deal of a little Bottle of Rum half a Goat and Powder and Shot for killing more and two large Watchcoats of those which as I mention'd before I had sav'd out of the Seamen's Chests these I took one to lye upon and the other to cover me in the Night  It was the sixth of  November  in the sixth Year of my Reign or my Captivity which you please That I set out on this Voyage and I found it much longer than I expected for though the Island it self was not very large yet when I came to the  East  Side of it I found a great Ledge of Rocks lye out above two Leagues into the Sea some above Water some under it and beyond that a Shoal of Sand lying dry half a League more so that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double the Point  When first I discover'd them I was going to give over my Enterprise and come back again not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to Sea and above all doubting how I should get back  again so I came to an Anchor for I had made me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken Graplin which I got out of the Ship  Having secur'd my Boat I took my Gun and went on Shore climbing up upon a Hill which seem'd to overlook that Point where I saw the full Extent of it and resolv'd to venture  In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood I perceiv'd a strong and indeed a most furious Current which run to the  East  and even came close to the Point and I took the more Notice of it because I saw there might be some Danger that when I came into it I might be carry'd out to Sea by the Strength of it and not be able to make the Island again and indeed had I not gotten first up upon this Hill I believe it would have been so for there was the same Current on the other Side the Island only that it set off at a farther Distance and I saw there was a strong Eddy under the Shore so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first Current and I should presently be in an Eddy  I lay here however two Days because the Wind blowing pretty fresh at  E S E  and that being just contrary to the said Current made a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach nor to go too far off because of the Stream  The third Day in the Morning the Wind having abated over Night the Sea was calm and I ventur'd but I am a warning Piece again to all rash and ignorant Pilots for no sooner was I come to the Point when even I was not my Boat's Length from the Shore but I found my self in a great Depth of Water and a Current like the Sluice of a Mill It carry'd my Boat a long with it  with such Violence That all I could do could not keep her so much as on the Edge of it but I found it hurry'd me farther and farther out from the Eddy which was on my left Hand There was no Wind stirring to help me and all I could do with my Paddlers signify'd nothing and now I began to give my self over for lost for as the Current was on both Sides the Island I knew in a few Leagues Distance they must joyn again and then I was irrecoverably gone nor did I see any Possibility of avoiding it so that I had no Prospect before me but of Perishing not by the Sea for that was calm enough but of starving for Hunger I had indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore as big almost as I could lift and had toss'd it into the Boat and I had a great Jar of fresh Water that is to say one of my Earthen Pots but what was all this to being driven into the vast Ocean where to be sure there was no Shore no main Land or Island for a thousand Leagues at least  And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God to make the most miserable Condition Mankind could be in  worse  Now I look'd back upon my desolate solitary Island as the most pleasant Place in the World and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for was to be but there again I stretch'd out my Hands to it with eager Wishes O happy Desart said I I shall never see thee more O miserable Creature said I whether am I going Then I reproach'd my self with my unthankful Temper and how I had repin'd at my solitary Condition and now what would I give to be on Shore there again Thus we never see the true State of our Condition till it is illustrated to us by its Contraries nor know how to value what we enjoy but by the want of it It is scarce possible to imagine the Consternation I was now in  being driven from my beloved Island for so it appear'd to me now to be into the wide Ocean almost two Leagues and in the utmost Despair of ever recovering it again However I work'd hard till indeed my Strength was almost exhausted and kept my Boat as much to the  Northward  that is towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on as possibly I could when about Noon as the Sun pass'd the Meridian I thought I felt a little Breeze of Wind in my Face springing up from the  S S E  This chear'd my Heart a little and especially when in about half an Hour more it blew a pretty small gentle Gale By this Time I was gotten at a frightful Distance from the Island and had the least Cloud or haizy Weather interven'd I had been undone another Way too for I had no Compass on Board and should never have known how to have steer'd towards the Island if I had but once lost Sight of it but the Weather continuing clear I apply'd my self to get up my Mast again spread my Sail standing away to the  North  as much as possible to get out of the Current  Just as I had set my Mast and Sail and the Boat began to stretch away I saw even by the Clearness of the Water some Alteration of the Current was near for where the Current was so strong the Water was foul but perceiving the Water clear I found the Current abate and presently I found to the  East  at about half a Mile a Breach of the Sea upon some Rocks these Rocks I found caus'd the Current to part again and as the main Srress of it ran away more  Southerly  leaving the Rocks to the  NorthEast  so the other return'd by the Repulse of the Rocks and made a strong Eddy which run back again to the  NorthWest  with a very sharp Stream  They who know what it is to have a Reprieve brought to them upon the Ladder or to be rescued from Thieves just a going to murther them or who have been in such like Extremities may guess what my present Surprise of Joy was and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy and the Wind also freshning how gladly I spread my Sail to it running chearfully before the Wind and with a strong Tide or Eddy under Eoot  This Eddy carryed me about a League in my Way back again directly towards the Island but about two Leagues more to the Northward than the Current which carried me away at first so that when I came near the Island I found my self open to the Northern Shore of it that is to say the other End of the Island opposite to that which I went out from  When I had made something more than a League of Way by the help of this Current or Eddy I found it was spent and serv'd me no farther However I found that being between the two great Currents  viz  that on the South Side which had hurried me away and that on the North which lay about a League on the other Side I say between these two in the wake of the Island I found the Water at least still and running no Way and having still a Breeze of Wind fair for me I kept on steering directly for the Island tho' not making such fresh Way as I did before  About four aClock in the Evening being then within about a League of the Island I found the Point of the Rocks which occasioned this Disaster stretching out as is describ'd before to the Southward and casting off the Current more Southwardly had of Course made another Eddy to the North and this I found very strong but not directly setting the Way my Course lay which was due West but  almost full North However having a fresh Gale I stretch'd across this Eddy slanting Northwest and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of the Shore where it being smooth Water I soon got to Land  When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat and refreshing my self with such Things as I had I brought my Boat close to the Shore in a little Cove that I had spy'd under some Trees and lay'd me down to sleep being quite spent with the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage  I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat I had run so much Hazard and knew too much the Case to think of attempting it by the Way I went out and what might be at the other Side I mean the West Side I knew not nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures so I only resolved in the Morning to make my Way Westward along the Shore and to see if there was no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety so as to have her again if I wanted her in about three Mile or thereabout coasting the Shore I came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet or Brook where I found a very convenient Harbour for my Boat and where she lay as if she had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her Here I put in and having stow'd my Boat very safe I went on Shore to look about me and see where I was  I soon found I had but a little past by the Place where I had been before when I travell'd on Foot to that Shore so taking nothing out of my Boat but my Gun and my Umbrella for it was exceeding hot I began my March The Way was comfortable enough after such a Voyage as I had  been upon and I reach'd my old Bower in the Evening where I found every thing standing as I left it for I always kept it in good Order being as I said before my Country House  I got over the Fence and laid me down in the Shade to rest my Limbs for I was very weary and fell asleep But judge you if you can that read my Story what a Surprize I must be in when I was wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name several times  Robin Robin Robin Crusoe  poor  Robin Crusoe  where are you  Robin Crusoe  Where are you Where have you been  I was so dead asleep at first being fatigu'd with Rowing or Paddling as it is call'd the first Part of the Day and with walking the latter Part that I did not wake thoroughly but dozing between sleeping and waking thought I dream'd that some Body spoke to me But as the Voice continu'd to repeat  Robin Crusoe Robin Crusoe  at last I began to wake more perfectly and was at first dreadfully frighted and started up in the utmost Consternation But no sooner were my Eyes open but I saw my  Poll  sitting on the Top of the Hedge and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to him and teach him and he had learn'd it so perfectly that he would sit upon my Finger and lay his Bill close to my Face and cry  Poor  Robin Crusoe  Where are you Where have you been How come you here  And such things as I had taught him  However even though I knew it was the Parrot and that indeed it could be no Body else it was a good while before I could compose my self First I was amazed how the Creature got thither and then how he should just keep about the Place and no where else But as I was well satisfied it  could be no Body but honest  Poll  I got it over and holding out my Hand and calling him by his Name  Poll  the sociable Creature came to me and sat upon my Thumb as he used to do and continu'd talking to me  Poor  Robin Crusoe and  how did I come here  and  where had I been  just as if he had been overjoy'd to see me again and so I carry'd him Home along with me  I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time and had enough to do for many Days to sit still and reflect upon the Danger I had been in I would have been very glad to have had my Boat again on my Side of the Island but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about as to the East Side of the Island which I had gone round I knew well enough there was no venturing that Way my very heart would shrink and my very Blood run chill but to think of it And as to the other Side of the Island I did not know how it might be there but supposing the Current ran with the same Force against the Shore at the East as it pass'd by it on the other I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream and carry'd by the Island as I had been before of being carry'd away from it so with these Thoughts I contented my self to be without any Boat though it had been the Product of so many Months Labour to make it and of so many more to get it unto the Sea  In this Government of ms Temper I remain'd near a Year liv'd a very edate retir'd Life as you may well suppose and my Thoughts being very much composed as to my Condition and fully comforted in resigning my self to the Dispositions of Providence I thought I liv'd really very happily in all things except that of Society  I improv'd my self in this time in all the mechanick Exercises which my Necessities put me upon applying my self to and I believe cou'd upon Occasion make a very good  Carpenter  especially considering how few Tools I had  Besides this I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my Earthen Ware and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel which I found infinitely easyer and better because I made things round and shapable which before were filthy things indeed to look on But I think I was never more vain of my own Performance or more joyful for any thing I found out than for my being able to make a TobaccoPipe And tho' it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it was done and only burnt red like other Earthen Ware yet as it was hard and firm and would draw the Smoke I was exceedingly comforted with it for I had been always used to smoke and there were Pipes in the Ship but I forgot them at first not knowing that there was Tobacco in the Island and afterwards when I search'd the Ship again I could not come at any Pipes at all  In my Wicker Ware also I improved much and made abundance of necessary Baskets as well as my Invention shew'd me tho' not very handsome yet they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up in or fetching things home in For Example if I kill'd a Goat abroad I could hang it up in a Tree flea it and dress it and cut it in Pieces and bring it home in a Basket and the like by a Turtle I could cut it up take out the Eggs and a Piece or two of the Flesh which was enough for me and bring them home in a Basket and leave the rest behind me Also large deep Baskets were my Receivers for my Corn which I always rubb'd out as  soon as it was dry and cured and kept it in great Baskets  I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably and this was a Want which it was impossible for me to supply and I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have no more Powder that is to say how I should do to kill any Goat I had as is observ'd in the third Year of my being here kept a young Kid and bred her up tame and I was in hope of getting a HeGoat but I could not by any Means bring it to pass 'till my Kid grew an old Goat and I could never find in my Heart to kill her till she dy'd at last of meer Age  But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence and as I have said my Ammunition growing low I set my self to study some Art to trap and snare the Goats to see whether I could not catch some of them alive and particularly I wanted a SheGoat great with young  To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them and I do believe they were more than once taken in them but my Tackle was not good for I had no Wire and I always found them broken and my Bait devoured  At length I resolv'd to try a Pitfall so I dug several large Pits in the Earth in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed and over these Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own making too with a great Weight upon them and several times I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice without setting the Trap and I could easily perceive that the Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn for I could see the Mark of their Feet At length I set three Traps in one Night and going the next Morning I found them all standing and yet the Bait eaten and gone This was very discouraging  However I alter'd my Trap and not to trouble you with Particulars going one Morning to see my Trap I found in one of them a large old HeGoat and in one of the other three Kids a Male and two Females  As to the old one I knew not what to do with him he was so fierce I durst not go into the Pit to him that is to say to go about to bring him away alive which was what I wanted I could have kill'd him but that was not my Business nor would it answer my End So I e'en let him out and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of his Wits But I had forgot then what I learn'd afterwards that Hunger will tame a Lyon If I had let him stay there three or four Days without Food and then have carry'd him some Water to drink and then a little Corn he would have been as tame as one of the Kids for they are mighty sagacious tractable Creatures where they are well used  However for the present I let him go knowing no better at that time then I went to the three Kids and taking them one by one I tyed them with Strings together and with some Difficulty brought them all home  It was a good while before they wou'd feed but throwing them some sweet Corn it tempted them and they began to be tame and now I found that if I expected to supply my self with GoatFlesh when I had no Powder or Shot left breeding some up tame was my only way when perhaps I might have them about my House like a Flock of Sheep  But then it presently occurr'd to me that I must keep the tame from the wild or else they would always run wild when they grew up and the only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece of  Ground well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale to keep them in so effectually that those within might not break out or those without break in  This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands yet as I saw there was an absolute Necessity of doing it my first Piece of Work was to find out a proper Piece of Ground  viz  where there was likely to be Herbage for them to eat Water for them to drink and Cover to keep them from the Sun  Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very little Contrivance when I pitch'd upon a Place very proper for all these being a plain open Piece of MeadowLand or  Savanna  as our People call it in the Western Collonies which had two or three little Drills of fresh Water in it and at one end was very woody I say they will smile at my Forecast when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such a manner that my Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile about Nor was the Madness of it so great as to the Compass for if it was ten Mile about I was like to have time enough to do it in But I did not consider that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass as if they had had the whole Island and I should have so much Room to chace them in that I should never catch them  My Hedge was begun and carry'd on I believe about fifty Yards when this Thought occurr'd to me so I presently stopt short and for the first beginning I resolv'd to enclose a Piece of about Yards in length and Yards in breadth which as it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time so as my Flock encreased I could add more Ground to my Enclosure  This was acting with some Prudence and I went to work with Courage I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece and till I had done it I tether'd the three Kids in the best part of it and us'd them to feed as near me as possible to make them familiar and very often I would go and carry them some Ears of Barley or a handful of Rice and feed them out of my Hand so that after my Enclosure was finished and I let them loose they would follow me up and down bleating after me for a handful of Corn  This answer'd my End and in about a Year and half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats Kids and all and in two Years more I had three and forty besides several that I took and kill'd for my Food And after that I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to feed them in with little Pens to drive them into to take them as I wanted and Gates out of one Piece of Ground into another  But this was not all for now I not only had Goats Flesh to feed on when I pleas'd but Milk too a thing which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as think of and which when it came into my Thoughts was really an agreeable Surprize For now I set up my Dairy and had sometimes a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day And as Nature who gives Supplies of Food to every Creature dictates even naturally how to make use of it so I that had never milk'd a Cow much less a Goat or seen Butter or Cheese made very readily and handily tho' after a great many Essays and Miscarriages made me both Butter and Cheese at last and never wanted it afterwards  How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures even in those Conditions in which they seem'd to be overwhelm'd in Destruction How  can he sweeten the bitterest Providences and give us Cause to praise him for Dungeons and Prisons What a Table was here spread for me in a Wilderness where I saw nothing at first but to perish for Hunger  It would have made a Stoick smile to have seen me and my little Family sit down to Dinner there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole Island I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my absolute Command I could hang draw give Liberty and take it away and no Rebels among all my Sublects  Then to see how like a King I din'd too all alone attended by my Servants  Poll  as if he had been my Favourite was the only Person permitted to talk to me My Dog who was now grown very old and crazy and had found no Species to multiply his Kind upon sat always at my Right Hand and two Cats one on one Side the Table and one on the other expecting now and then a Bit from my Hand as a Mark of special Favour  But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first for they were both of them dead and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my own Hand but one of them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind of Creature these were two which I had preserv'd tame whereas the rest run wild in the Woods and became indeed troublesom to me at last for they would often come into my House and plunder me too till at last I was obliged to shoot them and did kill a great many at length they left me with this Attendance and in this plentiful Manner I lived neither could I be said to want any thing but Society and of that in some time after this I was like to have too much  I was something impatient as I have observ'd to have the Use of my Boat though very loath to run any more Hazards and therefore sometimes I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island and at other Times I sat my self down contented enough without her But I had a strange Uneasiness in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island where as I have said in my last Ramble I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay and how the Current set that I might see what I had to do This Inclination encreas'd upon me every Day and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land following the Edge of the Shore I did so But had any one in  England  been to meet such a Man as I was it must either have frighted them or rais'd a great deal of Laughter and as I frequently stood still to look at my self I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling through  Yorkshire  with such an Equipage and in such a Dress Be pleas'd to take a Scetch of my Figure as follows  I had a great high shapeless Cap made of a Goat's Skin with a Flap hanging down behind as well to keep the Sun from me as to shoot the Rain off from running into my Neck nothing being so hurtful in these Climates as the Rain upon the Flesh under the Cloaths  I had a short Jacket of GoatSkin the Skirts coming down to about the middle of my Thighs and a Pair of openknee'd Breeches of the same the Breeches were made of the Skin of an old  Hegoat  whose Hair hung down such a Length on either Side that like  Pantaloons  it reach'd to the middle of my Legs Stockings and Shoes I had none but had made me a Pair of somethings I scarce know what to call them like Buskins to flap over my Legs and lace on either Side like Spatterdashes  but of a most barbarous Shape as indeed were all the rest of my Cloaths  I had on a broad Belt of Goat'sSkin dry'd which I drew together with two Thongs of the same instead of Buckles and in a kind of a Frog on either Side of this Instead of a Sword and a Dagger hung a little Saw and a Hatchet one on one Side one on the other I had another Belt not so broad and fasten'd in the same Manner which hung over my Shoulder and at the End of it under my left Arm hung two Pouches both made of Goat'sSkin too in one of which hung my Powder in the other my Shot At my Back I carry'd my Basket on my Shoulder my Gun and over my Head a great clumsy ugly GoatSkin Umbrella but which after all was the most necessary Thing I had about me next to my Gun As for my Face the Colour of it was really not so  Moletta  like as one might expect from a Man not at all careful of it and living within nineteen Degrees of the  Equinox  My Beard I had once suffer'd to grow till it was about a Quarter of a Yard long but as I had both Scissars and Razors sufficient I had cut it pretty short except what grew on my upper Lip which I had trimm'd into a large Pair of  Mahometan  Whiskers such as I had seen worn by some  Turks  who I saw at  Sallee  for the  Moors  did not wear such tho' the  Turks  did of these Muschatoes or Whiskers I will not say they were long enough to hang my Hat upon them but they were of a Length and Shape monstrous enough and such as in  England  would have pass'd for frightful  But all this is by the by for as to my Figure I had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of Consequence so I say no more to that Part In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey and was out five or six Days I travell'd first along the  Sea Shore directly to the Place where I first brought my Boat to an Anchor to get up upon the Rocks and having no Boat now to take care of I went over the Land a nearer Way to the same Height that I was upon before when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks which lay out and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat as is said above I was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet no Ripling no Motion no Current any more there than in other Places  I was at a strange Loss to understand this and resolv'd to spend some Time in the observing it to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occasion'd it but I was presently convinc'd how it was  viz  That the Tide of Ebb setting from the  West  and joyning with the Current of Waters from some great River on the Shore must be the Occasion of this Current and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the  West  or from the  North  this Current came nearer or went farther from the Shore for waiting thereabouts till Evening I went up to the Rock again and then the Tide of Ebb being made I plainly saw the Current again as before only that it run farther of being near half a League from the Shore whereas in my Case it set close upon the Shore and hurry'd me and my  Canoe  along with it which at another Time it would not have done  This Observation convinc'd me That I had nothing to do but to observe the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide and I might very easily bring my Boat about the Island again But when I began to think of putting it in Practice I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the Danger I had been in that I could not think of it again with any Patience but on the contrary I took up another Resolution which was more safe  though more laborious and this was That I would build or rather make me another  Periagau  or  Canoe  and so have one for one Side of the Island and one for the other  You are to understand that now I had as I may call it two Plantations in the Island one my little Fortification or Tent with the Wall about it under the Rock with the Cave behind me which by this Time I had enlarg'd into several Apartments or Caves one within another One of these which was the dryest and largest and had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification that is to say beyond where my Wall joyn'd to the Rock was all fill'd up with the large Earthen Pots of which I have given an Account and with fourteen or fifteen great Baskets which would hold five or six Bushels each where I laid up my Stores of Provision especially my Corn some in the Ear cut off short from the Straw and the other rubb'd out with my Hand  As for my Wall made  as before  with long Stakes or Piles those Piles grew all like Trees and were by this Time grown so big and spread so very much that there was not the least Appearance to any one's View of any Habitation behind them  Near this Dwelling of mine but a little farther within the Land and upon lower Ground lay my two Pieces of CornGround which I kept duly cultivated and sow'd and which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season and whenever I had occasion for more Corn I had more Land adjoyning as fit as that  Besides this I had my Country Seat and I had now a tollerable Plantation there also for first I had my little Bower as I call'd it which I kept in Repair  that is to say  I kept the Hedge which circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual Height  the Ladder standing always in the Inside I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes but were now grown very firm and tall I kept them always so cut that they might spread and grow thick and wild and make the more agreeable Shade which they did effectually to my Mind In the Middle of this I had my Tent always standing being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set up for that Purpose and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing and under this I had made me a Squab or Couch with the Skins of the Creatures I had kill'd and with other soft Things and a Blanket laid on them such as belong'd to our SeaBedding which I had saved and a great WatchCoat to cover me and here whenever I had Occasion to be absent from my chief Seat I took up my Country Habitation  Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle that is to say my Goats And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclose this Ground so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire lest the Goats should break thro' that I never left off till with infinite Labour I had stuck the Outside of the Hedge so full of small Stakes and so near to one another that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge and there was scarce Room to put a Hand thro' between them which afterwards when those Stakes grew as they all did in the next rainy Season made the Enclosure strong like a Wall indeed stronger than any Wall  This will testify for me that I was not idle and that I spared no Pains to bring to pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame Creatures thus at my Hand would be a living Magazine of Flesh Milk Butter and Cheese  for me as long as I liv'd in the Place if it were to be forty Years and that keeping them in my Reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures to such a Degree that I might be sure of keeping them together which by this Method indeed I so effectually secur'd that when these little Stakes began to grow I had planted them so very thick I was forced to pull some of them up again  In this Place also I had my Grapes growing which I principally depended on for my Winter Store of Raisins and which I never fail'd to preserve very carefully as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet and indeed they were not agreeable only but physical wholesome nourishing and refreshing to the last Degree  As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation and the Place where I had laid up my Boat I generally stay'd and lay here in my Way thither for I used frequently to visit my Boat and I kept all Things about or belonging to her in very good Order sometimes I went out in her to divert my self but no more hazardous Voyages would I go nor scarce ever above a Stone's Cast or two from the Shore I was so apprehensive of being hurry'd out of my Knowledge again by the Currents or Winds or any other Accident But now I come to a new Scene of my Life  It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards my Boat I was exceedingly surpriz'd with the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore which was very plain to be seen in the Sand I stood like one Thunderstruck or as if I had seen an Apparition I listen'd I look'd round me I could hear nothing nor see any Thing I went up to a rising Ground to look farther I went up the Shore and down the Shore but it was all one I could see no other  Impression but that one I went to it again to see if there were any more and to observe if it might not be my Fancy but there was no Room for that for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot Toes Heel and every Part of a Foot how it came thither I knew not nor could in the least imagine But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts like a Man perfectly confus'd and out of my self I came Home to my Fortification not feeling as we say the Ground I went on but terrify'd to the last Degree looking behind me at every two or three Steps mistaking every Bush and Tree and fancying every Stump at a Distance to be a Man nor is it possible to describe how many various Shapes affrighted Imagination represented Things to me in how many wild Ideas were found every Moment in my Fancy and what strange unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the Way  When I came to my Castle for so I think I call'd it ever after this I fled into it like one pursued whether I went over by the Ladder as first contriv'd or went in at the Hole in the Rock which I call'd a Door I cannot remember no nor could I remember the next Morning for never frighted Hare fled to Cover or Fox to Earth with more Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat  I slept none that Night the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright the greater my Apprehensions were which is something contrary to the Nature of such Things and especially to the usual Practice of all Creatures in Fear But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful Ideas of the Thing that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self even tho' I was now a great way off of it Sometimes I fancy'd it must be the Devil and Reason joyn'd in with me upon this Supposition For how should any other Thing in human  Shape come into the Place Where was the Vessel that brought them What Marks was there of any other Footsteps And how was it possible a Man should come there But then to think that  Satan  should take human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could be no manner of Occasion for it but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him and that even for no Purpose too for he could not be sure I should see it this was an Amusement the other Way I consider'd that the Devil might have found out abundance of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the single Print of a Foot That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the Island he would never have been so simple to leave a Mark in a Place where 'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not and in the Sand too which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind would have defac'd entirely All this seem'd inconsistent with the Thing it self and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of the Devil  Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out of all Apprehensions of its being the Devil And I presently concluded then that it must be some more dangerous Creature  viz  That it must be some of the Savages of the main Land overagainst me who had wander'd out to Sea in their  Canoes  and either driven by the Currents or by contrary Winds had made the Island and had been on Shore but were gone away again to Sea being as loth perhaps to have stay'd in this desolate Island as I would have been to have had them  While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind I was very thankful in my Thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time or that they did not see my Boat by which they would have concluded that some Inhabitants  had been in the Place and perhaps have search'd farther for me Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their having found my Boat and that there were People here and that if so I should certainly have them come again in greater Numbers and devour me that if it should happen so that they should not find me yet they would find my Enclosure destroy all my Corn carry away all my Flock of tame Goats and I should perish at last for meer Want  Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope all that former Confidence in God which was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of his Goodness now vanished as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto could not preserve by his Power the Provision which he had made for me by his Goodness▪ I reproach'd my self with my Easiness that would not sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me till the next Season as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground and this I thought so just a Reproof that I resolv'd for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand so that whatever might come I might not perish for want of Bread  How strange a Chequer Work of Providence is the Life of Man and by what secret differing Springs are the Affections hurry'd about as differing Circumstance present To Day we love what to Morrow we hate to Day we seek what to Morrow we shun to Day we desire what to Morrow we fear nay even tremble at the Apprehensions of this was exemplify'd in me at this Time in the most lively Manner imaginable for I whose only Affliction was that I seem'd banished from human Society that I was alone circumscrib'd by the boundless Ocean cut off from Mankind and condemn'd  to what I call'd silent Life that I was as one who Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Living or to appear among the rest of his Creatures that to have seen one of my own Species would have seem'd to me a Raising me from Death to Life and the greatest Blessing that Heaven it self next to the supreme Blessing of Salvation could bestow  I say  that I should now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing a Man and was ready to sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance of a Man's having set his Foot in the Island  Such is the uneven State of human Life And it afforded me a great many curious Speculations afterwards when I had a little recover'd my first Surprize I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely wise and good Providence of God had determin'd for me that as I could not foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this so I was not to dispute his Sovereignty who as I was his Creature had an undoubted Right by Creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit and who as I was a Creature who had offended him had likewise a judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit and that it was my Part to submit to bear his Indignation because I had sinn'd against him  I then reflected that God who was not only Righteous but Omnipotent as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me so he was able to deliver me that if he did not think fit to do it 'twas my unquestion'd Duty to resign my self absolutely and entirely to his Will and on the other Hand it was my Duty also to hope in him pray to him and quietly to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily Providence  These Thoughts took me up many Hours Days nay I may say Weeks and Months and one particular Effect of my Cogitations on this Occasion I cannot omit  viz  One Morning early lying in my Bed and fill'd with Thought about my Danger from the Appearance of Savages I found it discompos'd me very much upon which those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts  Call upon me in the Day of Trouble and I will deliver and thou shalt glorify me    Upon this rising chearfully out of my Bed my Heart was not only comforted but I was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance When I had done praying I took up my Bible and opening it to read the first Words that presented to me were  Wait on the Lord and be of good Cheer and he shall strengthen thy Heart wait I say on the Lord  It is impossible to express the Comfort this gave me In Answer I thankfully laid down the Book and was no more sad at least not on that Occasion  In the middle of these Cogitations Apprehensions and Reflections it came into my Thought one Day that all this might be a meer Chimera of my own and that this Foot might be the Print of my own Foot when I came on Shore from my Boat This chear'd me up a little too and I began to perswade my self it was all a Delusion that it was nothing else but my own Foot and why might not I come that way from the Boat as well as I was going that way to the Boat again I consider'd also that I could by no Means tell for certain where I had trod and where I had not and that if at last this was only the Print of my own Foot I had play'd the Part of those Fools who strive to make stories of Spectres and Apparitions and then are frighted at them more than any body  Now I began to take Courage and to peep abroad again for I had not stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights so that I began to starve for Provision for I had little or nothing within Doors but some Barley Cakes and Water Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too which usually was my Evening Diversion and the poor Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it and indeed it almost spoil'd some of them and almost dry'd up their Milk  Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but the Print of one of my own Feeet and so I might be truly said to start at my own Shadow I began to go abroad again and went to my Country House to milk my Flock but to see with what Fear I went forward how often I look'd behind me how I was ready every now and then to lay down my Basket and run for my Life it would have made any one have thought I was haunted with an evil Conscience or that I had been lately most terribly frighted and so indeed I had  However as I went down thus two or three Days and having seen nothing I began to be a little bolder and to think there was really nothing in it but my own Imagination But I cou'd not perswade my self fully of this till I should go down to the Shore again and see this Print of a Foot and measure it by my own and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot But when I came to the Place  First  It appear'd evidently to me that when I laid up my Boat I could not possibly be on Shore any where there about  Secondly  When I came to measure the Mark with my own Foot I found my Foot not so large by a great deal both these Things fill'd my Head with new Imaginations and gave me the Vapours again to the highest Degree so that I  shook with cold like one in an Ague And I went Home again fill'd with the Belief that some Man or Men had been on Shore there or in short that the Island was inhabited and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware and what course to take for my Security I knew not  O what ridiculous Resolution Men take when possess'd with Fear It deprives them of the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief The first Thing I propos'd to my self was to throw down my Enclosures and turn all my tame Cattle wild into the Woods that the Enemy might not find them and then frequent the Island in Prospect of the same or the like Booty Then to the simple Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields that they might not find such a Grain there and still be prompted to frequent the Island then to demolish my Bower and Tent that they might not see any Vestiges of Habitation and be prompted to look farther in order to find out the Persons inhabiting  These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation after I was come Home again while the Apprehensions which had so overrun my Mind were fresh upon me and my Head was full of Vapours as above Thus Fear of Danger is ten thousand Times more terrifying than Danger it self when apparent to the Eyes and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much than the Evil which we are anxious about and which was worse than all this I had not that Relief in this Trouble from the Resignation I used to practise that I hop'd to have I look'd I thought like  Saul  who complain'd not only that the  Philistines  were upon him but that God had forsaken him for I did not now take due Ways to compose my Mind by crying to God in my Distress and resting upon his Providence  as I had done before for my Defence and Deliverance which if I had done I had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution  This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night but in the Morning I fell asleep and having by the Amusement of my Mind been as it were tyr'd and my Spirits exhausted I slept very soundly and wak'd much better compos'd than I had ever been before and now I began to think sedately and upon the utmost Debate with my self I concluded That this Island which was so exceeding pleasant fruitful and no farther from the main Land than as I had seen was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine That altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot yet that there might sometimes come Boats off from the Shore who either with Design or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross Winds might come to this Place  That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now and had not met with the least Shadow or Figure of any People yet and that if at any Time they should be driven here it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion to this Time  That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from was from any such casual accidental Landing of straggling People from the Main who as it was likely if they were driven hither were here against their Wills so they made no stay here but went off again with all possible Speed seldom staying one Night on Shore least they should not have the Help of the Tides and Daylight back again and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider  of some safe Retreat in Case I should see any Savages land upon the Spot  Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my Cave so large as to bring a Door through again which Door as I said came out beyond where my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock upon maturely considering this therefore I resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification in the same Manner of a Semicircle at a Distance from my Wall just where I had planted a double Row of Trees about twelve Years before of which I made mention These Trees having been planted so thick before they wanted but a few Piles to be driven between them that they should be thicker and stronger and my Wall would be soon finish'd  So that I had now a double Wall and my outer Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber old Cables and every Thing I could think of to make it strong having in it seven little Holes about as big as I might put my Arm out at In the Inside of this I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot thick with continual bringing Earth out of my Cave and laying it at the Foot of the Wall and walking upon it and through the seven Holes I contriv'd to plant the Musquets of which I took Notice that I got seven on Shore out of the Ship these I say I planted like my Cannon and fitted them into Frames that held them like a Carriage that so I could fire all the seven Guns in two Minutes Time This Wall I was many a weary Month a finishing and yet never thought my self safe till it was done  When this was done I stuck all the Ground without my Wall for a great way every way as full with Stakes or Sticks of the  Osier  like Wood which I found so apt to grow as they could well stand insomuch that I believe I might set in near  twenty thousand of them leaving a pretty large Space between them and my Wall that I might have room to see an Enemy and they might have no shelter from the young Trees if they attempted to approach my outer Wall  Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years Time I had a Wood before my Dwelling growing so monstrous thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable and no Men of what kind soever would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it much less a Habitation As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out for I left no Avenue it was by setting two Ladders one to a Part of the Rock which was low and then broke in and left room to place another Ladder upon that so when the two Ladders were taken down no Man living could come down to me without mischieving himself and if they had come down they were still on the Outside of my outer Wall  Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own Preservation and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether without just Reason though I foresaw nothing at that Time more than my meer Fear suggested to me  While this was doing I was not altogether Careless of my other Affairs for I had a great Concern upon me for my little Herd of Goats they were not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion and began to be sufficient to me without the Expence of Powder and Shot but also without the Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones and I was loth to lose the Advantage of them and to have them all to nurse up over again  To this Purpose after long Consideration I could think of but two Ways to preserve them  one was to find another convenient Place to dig a a Cave Underground and to drive them into it every Night and the other was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land remote from one another and as much conceal'd as I could where I might keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each Place So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock in general I might be able to raise them again with little Trouble and Time And this tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour I thought was the most rational Design  Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retit'd Parts of the Island and I pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart could wish for it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the hollow and thick Woods where as is observ'd I almost lost my self once before endeavouring to come back that Way from the Eastern Part of the Island Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres so surrounded with Woods that it was almost an Enclosure by Nature at least it did not want near so much Labour to make it so as the other Pieces of Ground I had work'd so hard at  I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground and in less than a Month's Time I had so fenc'd it round that my Flock or Herd call it which you please who were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be were well enough secur'd in it So without any farther Delay I removed ten young SheGoats and two HeGoats to this Piece and when they were there I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it as secure as the other which however I did at more Leisure and it took me up more Time by a great deal  All this Labour I was at the Expence of purely from my Apprehensions on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen for as yet I never saw any human Creature come near the Island and I had now liv'd two Years under these Uneasinesses which indeed made my Life much less comfortable than it was before as may well be imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in the constant Snare of  the Fear of Man  and this I must observe with Grief too that the Discomposure of my Mind had too great Impressions also upon the religious Part of my Thoughts for the Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals lay so upon my Spirits that I seldom found my self in a due Temper for Application to my Maker at least not with the sedate Calmness and Resignation of Soul which I was wont to do I rather pray'd to God as under great Affliction and Pressure of Mind surrounded with Danger and in Expectation every Night of being murther'd and devour'd before Morning and I must testify from my Experience▪ that a Temper of Peace Thankfulness Love and Affection is much more the proper Frame for Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure and that under the Dread of Mischief impending a Man is no more fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of praying to God than he is for Repentance on a sick Bed For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the others do the Body and the Discomposure of the Mind must necessarily be as great a Disability as that of the Body and much greater Praying to God being properly an Act of the Mind not of the Body  But to go on After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living Stock I went about the whole Island searching for another private Place to make  such another Deposit when wandring more to the  West  Point of the Island than I had ever done yet and looking out to Sea I thought I saw a Boat upon the Sea at a great Distance I had found a Prospective Glass or two in one of the Seamen's Chests which I sav'd out of our Ship but I had it not about me and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make of it though I look'd at it till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any longer whether it was a Boat or not I do not know but as I descended from the Hill I could see no more of it so I gave it over only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective Glass in my Pocket  When I was come down the Hill to the End of the Island where indeed I had never been before I was presently convinc'd that the seeing the Print of a Man's Foot was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I imagin'd and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon the Side of the Island where the Savages never came I should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the  Canoes  from the Main when they happen'd to be a little too far out at Sea to shoot over to that Side of the Island for Harbour likewise as they often met and fought in their  Canoes  the Victors having taken any Prisoners would bring them over to this Shore where according to their dreadful Customs being all  Canibals  they would kill and eat them of which hereafter  When I was come down the Hill to the Shore as I said above being the  S W  Point of the Island I was perfectly confounded and amaz'd nor is it possible for me to express the Horror of my Mind at seeing the Shore spread with Skulls Hands Feet and other Bones of humane Bodies and particularly I observ'd a Place where there had  been a Fire made and a Circle dug in the Earth like a Cockpit where it is suppos'd the Savage Wretches had sat down to their inhumane Feastings upon the Bodies of their FellowCreatures  I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these Things that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my self from it for a long while All my Apprehensions were bury'd in the Thoughts of such a Pitch of inhuman hellish Brutality and the Horror of the Degeneracy of Humane Nature which though I had heard of often yet I never had so near a View of before in short I turn'd away my Face from the horrid Spectacle my Stomach grew sick and I was just at the Point of Fainting when Nature discharg'd the Disorder from my Stomach and having vomited with an uncommon Violence I was a little reliev'd but cou'd not bear to stay in the Place a Moment so I gat me up the Hill again with all the Speed I cou'd and walk'd on towards my own Habitation  When I came a little out of that Part of the Island I stood still a while as amaz'd and then recovering my self I look'd up with the utmost Affection of my Soul and with a Flood of Tears in my Eyes gave God Thanks that had cast my first Lot in a Part of the World where I was distinguish'd from such dreadful Creatures as these and that though I had esteem'd my present Condition very miserable had yet given me so many Comforts in it that I had still more to give Thanks for than to complain of and this above all that I had even in this miserable Condition been comforted with the Knowledge of himself and the Hope of his Blessing which was a Felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the Misery which I had suffer'd or could suffer  In this Frame of Thankfulness I went Home to my Castle and began to be much easier now as to the Safety of my Circumstances than ever I was before for I observ'd that these Wretches never came to this Island in search of what they could get perhaps not seeking not wanting or not expecting any Thing here and having often no doubt been up in the cover'd woody Part of it without finding any Thing to their Purpose I knew I had been here now almost eighteen Years and never saw the least Footsteps of Humane Creature there before and I might be here eighteen more as entirely conceal'd as I was now if I did not discover my self to them which I had no manner of Occasion to do it being my only Business to keep my self entirely conceal'd where I was unless I found a better sort of Creatures than  Canibals  to make my self known to  Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the Savage Wretches that I have been speaking of and of the wretched inhuman Custom of their devouring and eating one another up that I continu'd pensive and sad and kept close within my own Circle for almost two Years after this When I say my own Circle I mean by it my three Plantations  viz  my Castle my Country Seat which I call'd my Bower and my Enclosure in the Woods nor did I look after this for any other Use than as an Enclosure for my Goats for the Aversion which Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches was such that I was fearful of seeing them as of seeing the Devil himself nor did I so much as go to look after my Boat in all this Time but began rather to think of making me another for I cou'd not think of ever making any more Attempts to bring the other Boat round the Island to me least I should meet with some of these Creatures at Sea  in which if I had happen'd to have fallen into their Hands I knew what would have been my Lot  Time however and the Satisfaction I had that I was in no Danger of being discover'd by these People began to wear off my Uneasiness about them and I began to live just in the same compos'd Manner as before only with this Difference that I used more Caution and kept my Eyes more about me than I did before least I should happen to be seen by any of them and particularly I was more cautious of firing my Gun least any of them being on the Island should happen to hear of it and it was therefore a very good Providence to me that I had furnish'd my self with a tame Breed of Goats that I needed not hunt any more about the Woods or shoot at them and if I did catch any of them after this it was by Traps and Snares as I had done before so that for two Years after this I believe I never fir'd my Gun once of though I never went out without it and which was more as I had sav'd three Pistols out of the Ship I always carry'd them out with me or at least two of them sticking them in my Goatskin Belt also I furbish'd up one of the great Cutlashes that I had out of the Ship and made me a Belt to put it on also so that I was now a most formidable Fellow to look at when I went abroad if you add to the former Description of my self the Particular of two Pistols and a great broad Sword hanging at my Side in a Belt but without a Scabbard  Things going on thus as I have said for some Time I seem'd excepting these Cautions to be reduc'd to my former calm sedate Way of Living all these Things tended to shewing me more and more how far my Condition was from being miserable compar'd to some others nay to many other Particulars of Life which it might have pleased  God to have made my Lot It put me upon reflecting How little repining there would be among Mankind at any Condition of Life if People would rather compare their Condition with those that are worse in order to be thankful than be always comparing them with those which are better to assist their Murmurings and Complainings  As in my present Condition there were not really many Things which I wanted so indeed I thought that the Frights I had been in about these Savage Wretches and the Concern I had been in for my own Preservation had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my own Conveniences and I had dropp'd a good Design which I had once bent my Thoughts too much upon and that was to try if I could not make some of my Barley into Malt and then try to brew my self some Beer This was really a whimsical Thought and I reprov'd my self often for the Simplicity of it for I presently saw there would be the want of several Things necessary to the making my Beer that it would be impossible for me to supply as First Casks to preserve it in which was a Thing that as I have observ'd already I cou'd never compass no though I spent not many Days but Weeks nay Months in attempting it but to no purpose In the next Place I had no Hops to make it keep no Yeast to make it work no Copper or Kettle to make it boil and yet all these Things notwithstanding I verily believe had not these Things interven'd I mean the Frights and Terrors I was in about the Savages I had undertaken it and perhaps brought it to pass too for I seldom gave any Thing over without accomplishing it when I once had it in my Head enough to begin it  But my Invention now run quite another Way for Night and Day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these Monsters in their cruel bloody Entertainment and if possible save the Victim they should bring hither to destroy It would take up a larger Volume than this whole Work is intended to be to set down all the Contrivances I hatch'd or rather brooded upon in my Thought for the destroying these Creatures or at least frighting them so as to prevent their coming hither any more but all was abortive nothing could be possible to take effect unless I was to be there to do it my self and what could one Man do among them when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together with their Darts or their Bows and Arrows with which they could shoot as true to a Mark as I could with my Gun  Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place where they made their Fire and put in five or six Pound of Gunpowder which when they kindled their Fire would consequently take Fire and blow up all that was near it but as in the first Place I should be very loth to wast so much Powder upon them my Store being now within the Quantity of one Barrel so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain Time when it might surprise them and at best that it would do little more than just blow the Fire about their Ears and fright them but not sufficient to make them forsake the Place so I laid it aside and then propos'd that I would place my self in Ambush in some convenient Place with my three Guns all double loaded and in the middle of their bloody Ceremony let fly at them when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shoot and then falling in upon them with my three Pistols  and my Sword I made no doubt but that if there was twenty I should kill them all This Fancy pleas'd my Thoughts for some Weeks and I was so full of it that I often dream'd of it and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my Sleep  I went so far with it in my Imagination that I employ'd my self several Days to find out proper Places to put my self in Ambuscade as I said to watch for them and I went frequently to the Place it self which was now grown more familiar to me and especially while my Mind was thus fill'd with Thoughts of Revenge and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword as I may call it the Horror I had at the Place and at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring one another abated my Malice  Well at length I found a Place in the Side of the Hill where I was satisfy'd I might securely wait till I saw any of their Boats coming and might then even before they would be ready to come on Shore convey my self unseen into Thickets of Trees in one of which there was a Hollow large enough to conceal me entirely and were I might sit and observe all their bloody Doings and take my full aim at their Heads when they were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my Shoot or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first Shoot  In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design and accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets and my ordinary Fowling Piece The two Muskets I loaded with a Brace of Slugs each and four or five smaller Bullets about the Size of Pistol Bullets and the Fowling Piece I loaded with near a Handful of Swanshot of the largest Size I also loaded my Pistols with about four Bullets each and in this  Posture well provided with Ammunition for a second and third Charge I prepar'd my self for my Expedition  After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design and in my Imagination put it in Practice I continually made my Tour every Morning up to the Top of the Hill which was from my Castle as I call'd it about three Miles or more to see if I cou'd observe any Boats upon the Sea coming near the Island or standing over towards it but I began to tire of this hard Duty after I had for two or three Months constantly kept my Watch but came always back without any Discovery there having not in all that Time been the least Appearance not only on or near the Shore but not on the whole Ocean so far as my Eyes or Glasses could reach every Way  As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill to look out so long also I kept up the Vigour of my Design and my Spirits seem'd to be all the while in a suitable Form for so outragious an Execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a Discussion of in my Thoughts any farther than my Passions were at first fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd at the unnatural Custom of that People of the Country who it seems had been suffer'd by Providence in his wise Disposition of the World to have no other Guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated Passions and consequently were left and perhaps had been so for some Ages to act such horrid Things and receive such dreadful Customs as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Heaven and acted by some hellish Degeneracy could have run them into But now when as I have said I began to be weary of the fruitless Excursion which I had made so long and so far every  Morning in vain so my Opinion of the Action it self began to alter and I began with cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I was going to engage in What Authority or Call I had to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon these Men as Criminals whom Heaven had thought fit for so many Ages to suffer unpunish'd to go on and to be as it were the Executioners of his Judgments one upon another How far these People were Offenders against me and what Right I had to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another I debated this very often with my self thus How do I know what God himself judges in this particular Case it is certain these People either do not commit this as a Crime it is not against their own Consciences reproving or their Light reproaching them They do not know it be an Offence and then commit it in Defiance of Divine Justice as we do in almost all the Sins we commit They think it no more a Crime to kill a Captive taken in War than we do to kill an Ox nor to eat humane Flesh than we do to eat Mutton  When I had consider'd this a little it follow'd necessarily that I was certainly in the Wrong in it that these People were not Murtherers in the Sense that I had before condemn'd them in my Thoughts any more than those Christians were Murtherers who often put to Death the Prisoners taken in Battle or more frequently upon many Occasions put whole Troops of Men to the Sword without giving Quarter though they threw down their Arms and submitted  In the next Place it occurr'd to me that albeit the Usage they thus gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman yet it was really nothing to me These People had done me no Injury That if they  attempted me or I saw it necessary for my immediate Preservation to fall upon them something might be said for it but that as I was yet out of their Power and they had really no Knowledge me and consequently no Design upon me and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them That this would justify the Conduct of the  Spaniards  in all their Barbarities practis'd in  America  and where they destroy'd Millions of these People who however they were Idolaters and Barbarians and had several bloody and barbarous Rites in their Customs such as sacrificing human Bodies to their Idols were yet as to the  Spaniards  very innocent People and that the rooting them out of the Country is spoken of with the utmost Abhorrence and Detestation by even the  Spaniards  themselves at this Time and by all other Christian Nations of  Europe  as a meer Butchery a bloody and unnatural Piece of Cruelty unjustifiable either to God or Man and such as for which the very Name of a  Spaniard  is reckon'd to be frightful and terrible to all People of Humanity or of Christian Compassion As if the Kingdom of  Spain  were particularly Eminent for the Product of a Race of Men who were without Principles of Tenderness or the common Bowels of Pity to the Miserable which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous Temper in the Mind  These Considerations really put me to a Pause and to a kind of a Fullstop and I began by little and little to be off of my Design and to conclude I had taken wrong Measures in my Resolutions to attack the Savages that it was not my Business to meddle with them unless they first attack'd me and this it was my Business if possible to prevent but that if I were discover'd and attack'd then I knew my Duty  On the other hand I argu'd with my self That this really was the way not to deliver my self but entirely to ruin and destroy my self for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on Shore at that Time but that should ever come on Shore afterwards if but one of them escap'd to tell their Country People what had happen'd they would come over again by Thousands to revenge the Death of their Fellows and I should only bring upon my self a certain Destruction which at present I had no manner of occasion for  Upon the whole I concluded That neither in Principle or in Policy I ought one way or other to concern my self in this Affair That my Business was by all possible Means to conceal my self from them and not to leave the least Signal to them to guess by that there were any living Creatures upon the Island I mean of humane Shape  Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential and I was convinc'd now many Ways that I was perfectly out of my Duty when I was laying all my bloody Schemes for the Destruction of innocent Creatures I mean innocent as to me As to the Crimes they were guilty of towards one another I had nothing to do with them they were National and I ought to leave them to the Justice of God who is the Governour of Nations and knows how by National Punishments to make a just Retribution for National Offences and to bring publick Judgments upon those who offend in a publick Manner by such Ways as best pleases him  This appear'd so clear to me now that nothing was a greater Satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffer'd to do a Thing which I now saw so much Reason to believe would have been no less a Sin than that of wilful Murther if I had committed  it and I gave most humble Thanks on my Knees to God that had thus deliver'd me from BloodGuiltiness beseeching him to grant me the Protection of his Providence that I might not fall into the Hands of the Barbarians or that I might not lay my Hands upon them unless I had a more clear Call from Heaven to do it in Defence of my own Life  In this Disposition I continu'd for near a Year after this and so far was I from desiring an Occasion for falling upon these Wretches that in all that Time I never once went up the Hill to see whether there were any of them in Sight or to know whether any of them had been on Shore there or not that I might not be tempted to renew any of my Contrivances against them or be provok'd by any Advantage which might present it self to fall upon them only this I did I went and remov'd my Boat which I had on the other Side the Island and carry'd it down to the  East  End of the whole Island where I ran it into a little Cove which I found under some high Rocks and where I knew by Reason of the Currents the Savages durst not at least would not come with their Boats upon any Account whatsoever  With my Boat I carry'd away every Thing that I had left there belonging to her though not necessary for the bare going thither  viz  A Mast and Sail which I had made for her and a Thing like an Anchor but indeed which could not be call'd either Anchor or Grapling however it was the best I could make of its kind All these I remov'd that there might not be the least Shadow of any Discovery or any Appearance of any Boat or of any human Habitation upon the Island  Besides this I kept my self as I said more retir'd than ever and seldom went from my Cell other  than upon my constant Employment  viz  To milk my Shegoats and manage my little Flock in the Wood which as it was quite on the other Part of the Island was quite out of Danger for certain it is that these Savage People who sometimes haunted this Island never came with any Thoughts of finding any Thing here and consequently never wandred off from the Coast and I doubt not but they might have been several Times on Shore after my Apprehensions of them had made me cautious as well as before and indeed I look'd back with some Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Condition would have been if I had chop'd upon them and been discover'd before that when naked and unarm'd except with one Gun and that loaden often only with small Shot I walk'd every where peeping and peeping about the Island to see what I could get what a Surprise should I have been in if when I discover'd the Print of a Man's Foot I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty Savages and found them pursuing me and by the Swiftness of their Running no Possibility of my escaping them  The Thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very Soul within me and distress'd my Mind so much that I could not soon recover it to think what I should have done and how I not only should not have been able to resist them but even should not have had Presence of Mind enough to do what I might have done much less what now after so much Consideration and Preparation I might be able to do Indeed after serious thinking of these Things I should be very Melancholly and sometimes it would last a great while but I resolv'd it at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence which had deliver'd me from so many unseen Dangers and had kept me from those Mischiefs which  I could no way have been the Agent in delivering my self from because I had not the least Notion of any such Thing depending or the least Supposition of it being possible  This renew'd a Contemplation which often had come to my Thoughts in former Time when first I began to see the merciful Dispositions of Heaven in the Dangers we run through in this Life How wonderfully we are deliver'd when we know nothing of it How when we are in a  Quandary  as we call it a Doubt or Hesitation whether to go this Way or that Way a secret Hint shall direct us this Way when we intended to go that Way nay when Sense our own Inclination and perhaps Business has call'd to go the other Way yet a strange Impression upon the Mind from we know not what Springs and by we know not what Power shall overrule us to go this Way and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that Way which we should have gone and even to our Imagination ought to have gone we should have been ruin'd and lost Upon these and many like Reflections I afterwards made it a certain Rule with me That whenever I found those secret Hints or pressings of my Mind to doing or not doing any Thing that presented or to going this Way or that Way I never fail'd to obey the secret Dictate though I knew no other Reason for it than that such a Pressure or such a Hint hung upon my Mind I could give many Examples of the Success of this Conduct in the Course of my Life but more especially in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Island besides many Occasions which it is very likely I might have taken Notice of if I had seen with the same Eyes then that I saw with now But 'tis never too late to be wise and I cannot but advise all considering Men whose Lives are attended with such extraordinary  Incidents as mine or even though not so extraordinary not to slight such secret Intimations of Providence let them come from what invisible Intelligence they will that I shall not discuss and perhaps cannot account for but certainly they are a Proof of the Converse of Spirits and the secret Communication between those embody'd and those unembody'd and such a Proof as can never be withstood Of which I shall have Occasion to give some very remarkable Instances in the Remainder of my solitary Residence in this dismal Place  I believe the Reader of this will not think strange if I confess that these Anxieties these constant Dangers I liv'd in and the Concern that was now upon me put an End to all Invention and to all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future Accommodations and Conveniencies I had the Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands than that of my Food I car'd not to drive a Nail or chop a Stick of Wood now for fear the Noise I should make should be heard much less would I fire a Gun for the same Reason and above all I was intollerably uneasy at making any Fire least the Smoke which is visible at a great Distance in the Day should betray me and for this Reason I remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd Fire such as burning of Pots and Pipes  c  into my new Apartment in the Woods where after I had been some time I found to my unspeakable Consolation a meer natural Cave in the Earth which went in a vast way and where I dare say no Savage had he been at the Mouth of it would be so hardy as to venture in nor indeed would any Man else but one who like me wanted nothing so much as a safe Retreat  The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom of a great Rock where by meer accident I would say if I did not see abundant Reason to ascribe all such Things now to Providence I was cutting down some thick Branches of Trees to make Charcoal and before I go on I must observe the Reason of my making this Charcoal which was thus  I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Habitation as I said before and yet I could not live there without baking my Bread cooking my Meat  c  so I contriv'd to burn some Wood here as I had seen done in  England  under Turf till it became Chark or dry Coal and then putting the Fire out I preserv'd the Coal to carry Home and perform the other Services which Fire was wanting for at Home without Danger of Smoke  But this is by the by While I was cutting down some Wood here I perceiv'd that behind a very thick Branch of low Brushwood or under Wood there was a kind of hollow Place I was curious to look into it and getting with Difficulty into the Mouth of it I found it was pretty large that is to say sufficient for me to stand upright in it and perhaps another with me but I must confess to you I made more hast out than I did in when looking farther into the Place and which was perfectly dark I saw two broad shining Eyes of some Creature whether Devil or Man I knew not which twinkl'd like two Stars the dim Light from the Cave's Mouth shining directly in and making the Reflection  However after some Pause I recover'd my self and began to call my self a thousand Fools and tell my self that he that was afraid to see the Devil was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all alone and that I durst to believe there was nothing  in this Cave that was more frightful than my self upon this plucking up my Courage I took up a great Firebrand and in I rush'd again with the Stick flaming in my Hand I had not gone three Steps in but I was almost as much frighted as I was before for I heard a very loud Sigh like that of a Man in some Pain and it was follow'd by a broken Noise  as if  of Words half express'd and then a deep Sigh again I stepp'd back and was indeed struck with such a Surprize that it put me into a cold Sweat and if I had had a Hat on my Head I will not answer for it that my Hair might not have lifted it off But still plucking up my Spirits as well as I could and encouraging my self a little with considering that the Power and Presence of God was every where and was able to protect me upon this I stepp'd forward again and by the Light of the Firebrand holding it up a little over my Head I saw lying on the Ground a most monstrous frightful old Hegoat just making his Will as we say and gasping for Life and dying indeed of meer old Age  I stirr'd him a little to see if I could get him out and he essay'd to get up but was not able to raise himself and I thought with my self he might even lie there for if he had frighted me so he would certainly fright any of the Savages if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any Life in him  I was now recover'd from my Surprize and began to look round me when I found the Cave was but very small that is to say it might be about twelve Foot over but in no manner of Shape either round or square no Hands having ever been employ'd in making it but those of meer Nature I observ'd also that there was a Place at the farther Side of it that went in farther but was so  low that it requir'd me to creep upon my Hands and Knees to go into it and whither I went I knew not so having no Candle I gave it over for some Time but resolv'd to come again the next Day provided with Candles and a Tinderbox which I had made of the Lock of one of the Muskets with some wildfire in the Pan  Accordingly the next Day I came provided with six large Candles of my own making for I made very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow and going into this low Place I was oblig'd to creep upon all Fours  as I have said  almost ten Yards which by the way I thought was a Venture bold enough considering that I knew not how far it might go nor what was beyond it When I was got through the Strait I found the Roof rose higher up I believe near twenty Foot but never was such a glorious Sight seen in the Island I dare say as it was to look round the Sides and Roof of this Vault or Cave the Walls reflected thousand Lights to me from my two Candles what it was in Rock whether Diamonds or any other precious Stones or Gold which I rather suppos'd it to be I knew not  The Place I was in was a most delightful Cavity or Grotto of its kind as could be expected though perfectly dark the Floor was dry and level and had a sort of small lose Gravel upon it so that there was no nauseous or venemous Creature to be seen neither was there any damp or wet on the Sides or Roof The only Difficulty in it was the Entrance which however as it was a Place of Security and such a Retreat as I wanted I thought that was a Convenience so that I was really rejoyc'd at the Discovery and resolv'd without any Delay to bring some of those Things which I was most anxious about to this  Place particularly I resolv'd to bring hither my Magazine of Powder and all my spare Arms  viz  Two FowlingPieces for I had three in all and three Muskets for of them I had eight in all so I kept at my Castle only five which stood ready mounted like Pieces of Cannon on my outmost Fence and were ready also to take out upon any Expedition  Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammunition I took occasion to open the Barrel of Powder which I took up out of the Sea and which had been wet and I found that the Water had penetrated about three or four Inches into the Powder on every Side which caking and growing hard had preserv'd the inside like a Kernel in a Shell so that I had near sixty Pound of very good Powder in the Center of the Cask and this was an agreeable Discovery to me at that Time so I carry'd all away thither never keeping above two or three Pound of Powder with me in my Castle for fear of a Surprize of any kind I also carry'd thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets  I fancy'd my self now like one of the ancient Giants which are said to live in Caves and Holes in the Rocks where none could come at them for I perswaded my self while I was here if five hundred Savages were to hunt me they could never find me out or if they did they would not venture to attack me here  The old Goat who I found expiring dy'd in the Mouth of the Cave the next Day after I made this Discovery and I found it much easier to dig a great Hole there and throw him in and cover him with Earth than to drag him out so I interr'd him there to prevent the Offence to my Nose  I was now in my twenty third Year of Residence in this Island and was so naturaliz'd to the Place and to the Manner of Living that could I have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no Savages would come to the Place to disturb me I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my Time there even to the last Moment till I had laid me down and dy'd like the old Goat in the Cave I had also arriv'd to some little Diversions and Amusements which made the Time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before as First I had taught my Poll as I noted before to speak and he did it so familiarly and talk'd so articulately and plain that it was very pleasant to me and he liv'd with me no less than six and twenty Years How long he might live afterwards I know not though I know they have a Notion in the  Brasils  that they live a hundred Years perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still calling after  Poor Robin Crusoe  to this Day I wish no  English  Man the ill Luck to come there and hear him but if he did he would certainly believe it was the Devil My Dog was a very pleasant and loving Companion to me for no less than sixteen Years of my Time and then dy'd of meer old Age as for my Cats they multiply'd as I have observ'd to that Degree that I was oblig'd to shoot several of them at first to keep them from devouring me and all I had but at length when the two old Ones I brought with me were gone and after some time continually driving them from me and letting them have no Provision with me they all ran wild into the Woods except two or three Favourites which I kept tame and whose Young when they had any I always drown'd and these were part of my Family Besides these I always kept two or three houshold Kids about me who I  taught to feed out of my Hand and I had two more Parrots which talk'd pretty well and would all call  Robin Crusoe  but none like my first nor indeed did I take the Pains with any of them that I had done with him I had also several tame SeaFowls whose Names I know not who I caught upon the Shore and cut their Wings and the little Stakes which I had planted before my Castle Wall being now grown up to a good thick Grove these Fowls all liv'd among these low Trees and bred there which was very agreeable to me so that as I said above I began to be very well contented with the Life I led if it might but have been secur'd from the dread of the Savages  But it was otherwise directed and it may not be amiss for all People who shall meet wirh my Story to make this just Observation from it  viz  How frequently in the Course of our Lives the Evil which in it self we seek most to shun and which when we are fallen into it is the most dreadful to us is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our Deliverance by which alone we can be rais'd again from the Affliction we are fallen into I cou'd give many Examples of this in the Course of my unaccountable Life but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the Circumstances of my last Years of solitary Residence in this Island  It was now the Month of  December  as I said above in my twenty third Year and this being the  Southern  Solstice for Winter I cannot call it was the particular Time of my Harvest and requir'd my being pretty much abroad in the Fields when going out pretty early in the Morning even before it was thorow Daylight I was surpriz'd with seeing a Light of some Fire upon the Shore at a Distance from me of about two Mile towards the End of the Island where I had observ'd some Savages  had been as before but not on the other Side but to my great Affliction it was on my Side of the Island  I was indeed terribly surpriz'd at the Sight and stepp'd short within my Grove not daring to go out least I might be surpriz'd and yet I had no more Peace within from the Apprehensions I had that if these Savages in rambling over the Island should find my Corn standing or cut or any of my Works and Improvements they would immediately conclude that there were People in the Place and would then never give over till they had found me out In this Extremity I went back directly to my Castle pull'd up the Ladder after me and made all Things without look as wild and natural as I could  Then I prepar'd my self within putting my self in a Posture of Defence I loaded all my Cannon as I call'd them that is to say my Muskets which were mounted upon my new Fortification and all my Pistols and  esolv'd to defend my self to the last Gasp not forgetting seriously to commend my self to the Divine Protection and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Barbarians and in this Posture I continu'd about two Hours but began to be mighty impatient for Intelligence abroad for I had no Spies to send out  After sitting a while longer and musing what I should do in this Case I was not able to bear sitting in Ignorance any longer so setting up my Ladder to the Side of the Hill where there was a flat Place as I observ'd before and then pulling the Ladder up after me I set it up again and mounted to the Top of the Hill and pulling out my Perspective Glass which I had taken on Purpose I laid me down flat on my Belly on the Ground and began to look for the Place I presently found  there was no less than nine naked Savages sitting round a small Fire they had made not to warm them for they had no need of that the Weather being extreme hot but as I suppos'd to dress some of their barbarous Diet of humane Flesh which they had brought with them whether alive or dead I could not know  They had two  Canoes  with them which they had haled up upon the Shore and as it was then Tide of Ebb they seem'd to me to wait for the Return of the Flood to go away again it is not easy to imagine what Confusion this Sight put me into especially seeing them come on my Side the Island and so near me too but when I observ'd their coming must be always with the Current of the Ebb I began afterwards to be more sedate in my Mind being satisfy'd that I might go abroad with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood if they were not on Shore before And having made this Observation I went abroad about my Harvest Work with the more Composure  As I expected so it prov'd for as soon as the Tide made to the  Westward  I saw them all take Boat and row or paddle as we call it all away I should have observ'd that for an Hour and more before they went off they went to dancing and I could easily discern their Postures and Gestures by my Glasses I could not perceive by my nicest Observation but that they were stark naked and had not the least covering upon them but whether they were Men or Women that I could not distinguish  As soon as I saw them shipp'd and gone I took two Guns upon my Shoulders and two Pistols at my Girdle and my great Sword by my Side without a Scabbard and with all the Speed I was able to make I went away to the Hill where I had discover'd  the first Appearance of all and as soon as I gat thither which was not less than two Hours for I could not go apace being so loaden with Arms as I was I perceiv'd there had been three  Canoes  more of Savages on that Place and looking out farther I saw they were all at Sea together making over for the Main  This was a dreadful Sight to me especially when going down to the Shore I could see the Marks of Horror which the dismal Work they had been about had left behind it  viz  The Blood the Bones and part of the Flesh of humane Bodies eaten and devour'd by those Wretches with Merriment and Sport I was so fill'd with Indignation at the Sight that I began now to premeditate the Destruction of the next that I saw there let them be who or how many soever  It seem'd evident to me that the Visits which they thus make to this Island are not very frequent for it was above fifteen Months before any more of them came on Shore there again that is to say I neither saw them or any Footsteps or Signals of them in all that Time for as to the rainy Seasons then they are sure not to come abroad at least not so far yet all this while I liv'd uncomfortably by reason of the constant Apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize from whence I observe that the Expectation of Evil is more bitter than the Suffering especially if there is no room to shake off that Expectation or those Apprehensions  During all this Time I was in the murthering Humour and took up most of my Hours which should have been better employ'd in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next Time I should see them especially if they should be divided as they were the last Time into  two Parties nor did I consider at all that if I kill'd one Party suppose Ten or a Dozen I was still the next Day or Week or Month to kill aanother and so another even  ad infinitum  till I should be at length no less a Murtherer than they were in being Maneaters and perhaps much more so  I spent my Days now in great Perplexity and Anxiety of Mind expecting that I should one Day or other fall into the Hands of these merciless Creatures and if I did at any Time venture abroad it was not without looking round me with the greatest Care and Caution imaginable and now I found to my great Comfort how happy it was that I provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats for I durst not upon any account fire my Gun especially near that Side of the Island where they usually came least I should alarm the Savages and if they had fled from me now I was sure to have them come back again with perhaps two or three hundred  Canoes  with them in a few Days and then I knew what to expect  However I wore out a Year and three Months more before I ever saw any more of the Savages and then I found them again as I shall soon observe It is true they might have been there once or twice but either they made no stay or at least I did not hear them but in the Month of  May  as near as I could calculate and in my four and twentieth Year I had a very strange Encounter with them of which in its Place  The Perturbation of my Mind during this fifteen or sixteen Months Interval was very great I slept unquiet dream'd always frightful Dreams and often started out of my Sleep in the Night In the Day great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind and in the Night I dream'd often of killing the  Savages and of the Reasons why I might justify the doing of it but to wave all this for a while it was in the middle of  May  on the sixteenth Day I think as well as my poor wooden Calendar would reckon for I markt all upon the Post still I say it was the sixteenth of  May  that it blew a very great Storm of Wind all Day with a great deal of Lightning and Thunder and a very foul Night it was after it I know not what was the particular Occasion of it but as I was reading in the Bible and taken up with very serious Thoughts about my present Condition I was surpriz'd with a Noise of a Gun as I thought fir'd at Sea  This was to be sure a Surprize of a quite different Nature from any I had met with before for the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite of another kind I started up in the greatest hast imaginable and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the middle Place of the Rock and pull'd it after me and mounting it the second Time got to the Top of the Hill the very Moment that a Flash of Fire bid me listen for a second Gun which accordingly in about half a Minute I heard and by the sound knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where I was driven down the Current in my Boat  I immediately consider'd that this must be some Ship in Distress and that they had some Comrade or some other Ship in Company and fir'd these Guns for Signals of Distress and to obtain Help I had this Presence of Mind at that Minute as to think that though I could not help them it may be they might help me so I brought together all the dry Wood I could get at hand and making a good handsome Pile I set it on Fire upon the Hill the Wood was dry and blaz'd freely and though the Wind blew very hard yet it burnt fairly out that I was certain if there was any such Thing as a  Ship they must needs see it and no doubt they did for as soon as ever my Fire blaz'd up I heard another Gun and after that several others all from the same Quarter I ply'd my Fire all Night long till Day broke and when it was broad Day and the Air clear'd up I saw something at a great Distance at Sea full  East  of the Island whether a Sail or a Hull I could not distinguish no not with my Glasses the Distance was so great and the Weather still something haizy also at least it was so out at Sea  I look'd frequently at it all that Day and soon perceiv'd that it did not move so I presently concluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor and being eager you may be sure to be satisfy'd I took my Gun in my Hand and run toward the  South  Side of the Island to the Rocks where I had formerly been carry'd away with the Current and getting up there the Weather by this Time being perfectly clear I could plainly see to my great Sorrow the Wreck of a Ship cast away in the Night upon those concealed Rocks which I found when I was out in my Boat and which Rocks as they check'd the Violence of the Stream and made a kind of Counterstream or Eddy were the Occasion of my recovering from the most desperate hopeless Condition that ever I had been in in all my Life  Thus what is one Man's Safety is another Man's Destruction for it seems these Men whoever they were being out of their Knowledge and the Rocks being wholly under Water had been driven upon them in the Night the Wind blowing hard at  E  and  E N E  Had they seen the Island as I must necessarily suppose they did not they must as I thought have endeavour'd to have sav'd themselves on Shore by the Help of their Boat but their firing of Guns for Help especially when they saw as I  imagin'd my Fire fill'd me with many Thoughts First I imagin'd that upon seeing my Light they might have put themselves into their Boat and have endeavour'd to make the Shore but that the Sea going very high they might have been cast away other Times I imagin'd that they might have lost their Boat before as might be the Case many Ways as particularly by the Breaking of the Sea upon their Ship which many Times obliges Men to stave or take in Pieces their Boat and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own Hands Other Times I imagin'd they had some other Ship or Ships in Company who upon the Signals of Distress they had made had taken them up and carry'd them off Other whiles I fancy'd they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat and being hurry'd away by the Current that I had been formerly in were carry'd out into the great Ocean where there was nothing but Misery and Perishing and that perhaps they might by this Time think of starving and of being in a Condition to eat one another  As all these were but Conjectures at best so in the Condition I was in I could do no more than look on upon the Misery of the poor Men and pity them which had still this good Effect on my Side that it gave me more and more Cause to give Thanks to God who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate Condition and that of two Ships Companies who were now cast away upon this part of the World not one Life should be spar'd but mine I learn'd here again to observe that it is very rare that the Providence of God casts us into any Condition of Life so low or any Misery so great but we may see something or other to be thankful for and may see others in worse Circumstances than our own  Such certainly was the Case of these Men of whom I could not so much as see room to suppose any of them were sav'd nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there except the Possibility only of their being taken up by another Ship in Company and this was but meer Possibility indeed for I saw not the least Signal or Appearance of any such Thing  I cannot explain by any possible Energy of Words what a strange longing or hankering of Desires I felt in my Soul upon this Sight breaking out sometimes thus O that there had been but one or two nay or but one Soul sav'd out of this Ship to have escap'd to me that I might but have had one Companion one FellowCreature to have spoken to me and to have convers'd with In all the Time of my solitary Life I never felt so earnest so strong a Desire after the Society of my FellowCreatures or so deep a Regret at the want of it  There are some secret moving Springs in the Affections which when they are set a going by some Object in view or be it some Object though not in view yet rendred present to the Mind by the Power of Imagination that Motion carries out the Soul by its Impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the Object that the Absence of it is insupportable  Such were these earnest Wishings That but one Man had been sav'd  O that it had been but One  I believe I repeated the Words  O that it had been but One  A thousand Times and the Desires were so mov'd by it that when I spoke the Words my Hands would clinch together and my Fingers press the Palms of my Hands that if I had had any soft Thing in my Hand it wou'd have crusht it involuntarily and my Teeth in my Head wou'd strike  together and set against one another so strong that for some time I cou'd not part them again  Let the Naturalists explain these Things and the Reason and Manner of them all I can say to them is to describe the Fact which was even surprising to me when I found it though I knew not from what it should proceed it was doubtless the effect of ardent Wishes and of strong Ideas form'd in my Mind realizing the Comfort which the Conversation of one of my FellowChristians would have been to me  But it was not to be either their Fate or mine or both forbid it for till the last Year of my being on this Island I never knew whether any were saved out of that Ship or no and had only the Affliction some Days after to see the Corps of a drownded Boy come on Shore at the End of the Island which was next the Shipwreck He had on no Cloaths but a Seaman's Wastcoat a pair of open knee'd Linnen Drawers and a blew Linnen Shirt but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what Nation he was of He had nothing in his Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco Pipe the last was to me of ten times more value than the first  It was now calm and I had a great mind to venture out in my Boat to this Wreck not doubting but I might find something on board that might be useful to me but that did not altogether press me so much as the Possibility that there might be yet some living Creature on board whose Life I might not only save but might by saving that Life comfort my own to the last Degree and this Thought clung so to my Heart that I could not be quiet Night or Day but I must venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck and committing the rest to God's Providence I thought  the Impression was so strong upon my Mind that it could not be resisted that it must come from some invisible Direction and that I should be wanting to my self if I did not go  Under the Power of this Impression I hasten'd back to my Castle prepar'd every Thing for my Voyage took a Quantity of Bread a great Pot for fresh Water a Compass to steer by a Bottle of Rum for I had still a great deal of that left a Basket full of Raisins And thus loading my self with every Thing necessary I went down to my Boat got the Water out of her and got her afloat loaded all my Cargo in her and then went Home again for more my second Cargo was a great Bag full of Rice the Umbrella to set up over my Head for Shade another large Pot full of fresh Water and about two Dozen of my small Loaves or Barley Cakes more than before with a Bottle of Goat'sMilk and a Cheese all which with great Labour and Sweat I brought to my Boat and praying to God to direct my Voyage I put out and Rowing or Padling the Canoe along the Shore I came at last to the utmost Point of the Island on that Side  viz N E  And now I was to launch out into the Ocean and either to venture or not to venture I look'd on the rapid Currents which ran constantly on both Sides of the Island at a Distance and which were very terrible to me from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been in before and my Heart began to fail me for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those Currents I should be carry'd a vast Way out to Sea and perhaps out of my Reach or Sight of the Island again and that then as my Boat was but small if any little Gale of Wind should rise I should be inevitably lost  These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind that I began to give over my Enterprize and having haled my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore I stept out and sat me down upon a little rising bit of Ground very pensive and anxious between Fear and Desire about my Voyage when as I was musing I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd and the Flood come on upon which my going was for so many Hours impracticable upon this presently it occurr'd to me that I should go up to the highest Piece of Ground I could find and observe if I could how the Sets of the Tide or Currents lay when the Flood came in that I might judge whether if I was driven one way out I might not expect to be driven another way home with the same Rapidness of the Currents This Thought was no sooner in my Head but I cast my Eye upon a little Hill which sufficiently overlook'd the Sea both ways and from whence I had a clear view of the Currents or Sets of the Tide and which way I was to guide my self in my Return here I found that as the Current of the Ebb set out close by the South Point of the Island so the Current of the Flood set in close by the Shore of the North Side and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the North of the Island in my Return and I should do well enough  Encourag'd with this Observation I resolv'd the next Morning to set out with the first of the Tide and reposing my self for the Night in the Canoe under the great Watchcoat I mention'd I launched out I made first a little out to Sea full North till I began to feel the Benefit of the Current which set Eastward and which carry'd me at a great rate and yet did not so hurry me as the Southern Side Current had done before and so as to take from me all Government of the Boat but having a  strong Steerage with my Paddle I went at a great rate directly for the Wreck and in less than two Hours I came up to it  It was a dismal Sight to look at The Ship which by its building was  Spanish  stuck fast jaum'd in between two Rocks all the Stern and Quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the Sea and as her Forecastle which stuck in the Rocks had run on with great Violence her Mainmast and Foremast were brought by the Board that is to say broken short off but her Boltsprit was sound and the Head and Bow appear'd firm when I came close to her a Dog appear'd upon her who seeing me coming yelp'd and cry'd and as soon as I call'd him jump'd into the Sea to come to me and I took him into the Boat but found him almost dead for Hunger and Thirst I gave him a Cake of my Bread and he eat it like a ravenous Wolf that had been starving a Fortnight in the Snow I then gave the poor Creature some fresh Water with which if I would have let him he would have burst himself  After this I went on board but the first Sight I met with was two Men drown'd in the Cookroom or Forecastle of the Ship with their Arms fast about one another I concluded as is indeed probable that when the Ship struck it being in a Storm the Sea broke so high and so continually over her that the Men were not able to bear it and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the Water as much as if they had been under Water Besides the Dog there was nothing left in the Ship that had Life nor any Goods that I could see but what were spoil'd by the Water There were some Casks of Liquor whether Wine or Brandy I knew not which lay lower in the Hold and which the Water being ebb'd out I  could see but they were too big to meddle with I saw several Chests which I believ'd belong'd to some of the Seamen and I got two of them into the Boat without examining what was in them  Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd and the Forepart broken off I am perswaded I might have made a good Voyage for by what I found in these two Chests I had room to suppose the Ship had a great deal of Wealth on board and if I may guess by the Course she steer'd she must have been bound from the  Buenos Ayres  or the  Rio de la Plata  in the South Part of  America  beyond the  Brasils  to the  Havana  in the Gulph of  Mexico  and so perhaps to  Spain  She had no doubt a great Treasure in her but of no use at that time to any body and what became of the rest of her People I then knew not  I found besides these Chests a little Cask full of Liquor of about twenty Gallons which I got into my Boat with much Difficulty there were several Muskets in a Cabin and a great Powderhorn with about Pounds of Powder in it as for the Muskets I had no occasion for them so I left them but took the Powderhorn I took a Fire Shovel and Tongs which I wanted extremely as also two little Brass Kettles a Copper Pot to make Chocolate and a Gridiron and with this Cargo and the Dog I came away the Tide beginning to make home again and the same Evening about an Hour within Night I reach'd the Island again weary and fatigu'd to the last Degree  I repos'd that Night in the Boat and in the Morning I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new Cave not to carry it home to my Castle After refreshing my self I got all my Cargo on Shore and began to examine the Particulars The Cask of Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum but not such  as we had at the  Brasils  and in a Word not at all good but when I came to open the Chests I found several Things of great use to me For Example I found in one a fine Case of Bottles of an extraordinary kind and fill'd with Cordial Waters fine and very good the Bottles held about three Pints each and were tipp'd with Silver I found two Pots of very good Succades or Sweetmeats so fastned also on top that the Salt Water had not hurt them and two more of the same which the Water had spoil'd I found some very good Shirts which were very welcome to me and about a dozen and half of Linnen white Handkerchiefs and colour'd Neckcloths the former were also very welcome being exceeding refreshing to wipe my Face in a hot Day besides this when I came to the Till in the Chest I found there three great Bags of Pieces of Eight which held about eleven hundred Pieces in all and in one of them wrapt up in a Paper six Doubloons of Gold and some small Bars or Wedges of Gold I suppose they might all weigh near a Pound  The other Chest I found had some Cloaths in it but of little Value but by the Circumstances it must have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate though there was no Powder in it but about two Pound of fine glaz'd Powder in three small Flasks kept I suppose for charging their FowlingPieces on occasion Upon the whole I got very little by this Voyage that was of any use to me for as to the Money I had no manner of occasion for it 'Twas to me as the Dirt under my Feet and I would have given it all for three or four pair of  English  Shoes and Stockings which were Things I greatly wanted but had not had on my Feet now for many Years I had indeed gotten two pair of Shoes now which I took off of the Feet of the  two drown'd Men who I saw in the Wreck and I found two pair more in one of the Chests which were very welcome to me but they were not like our  English  Shoes either for Ease or Service being rather what we call Pumps than Shoes I found in this Seaman's Chest about fifty Pieces of Eight in Ryals but no Gold I suppose this belong'd to a poorer Man than the other which seem'd to belong to some Officer  Well however I lugg'd this Money home to my Cave and laid it up as I had done that before which I brought from our own Ship but it was great Pity as I said that the other Part of this Ship had not come to my Share for I am satisfy'd I might have loaded my  Canoe  several Times over with Money which if I had ever escap'd to  England  would have lain here safe enough till I might have come again and fetch'd it  Having now brought all my Things on Shore and secur'd them I went back to my Boat and row'd or paddled her along the Shore to her old Harbour where I laid her up and made the best of my way to my old Habitation where I found every thing safe and quiet so I began to repose my self live after my old fashion and take care of my Family Affairs and for a while I liv'd easy enough only that I was more vigilant than I us'd to be look'd out oftner and did not go abroad so much and if at any time I did stir with any Freedom it was always to the  East  Part of the Island where I was pretty well satisfy'd the Savages never came and where I could go without so many Precautions and such a Load of Arms and Ammunition as I always carry'd with me if I went the other way  I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more but my unlucky Head that was always to let me  know it was born to make my Body miserable was all this two Years fill'd with Projects and Designs how if it were possible I might get away from this Island for sometimes I was for making another Voyage to the Wreck though my Reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the Hazard of my Voyage Sometimes for a Ramble one way sometimes another and I believe verily if I had had the Boat that I went from  Sallee  in I should have ventur'd to Sea bound any where I knew not whither  I have been in all my Circumstances a  Memento  to those who are touch'd with the general Plague of Mankind whence for ought I know one half of their Miseries flow I mean that of not being satisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Nature has plac'd them for not to look back upon my primitive Condition and the excellent Advice of my Father the Opposition to which was  as I may call it  my ORIGINAL SIN my subsequent Mistakes of the same kind had been the Means of my coming into this miserable Condition for had that Providence which so happily had seated me at the  Brasils  as a Planter bless'd me with confin'd Desires and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually I might have been by this Time  I mean in the Time of my being in this Island  one of the most considerable Planters in the  Brasils  nay I am perswaded that by the Improvements I had made in that little Time I liv'd there and the Encrease I should probably have made if I had stay'd I might have been worth an hundred thousand  Moydors  and what Business had I to leave a settled Fortune a well stock'd Plantation improving and encreasing to turn  SupraCargo  to  Guinea  to fetch Negroes when Patience and Time would have so encreas'd our Stock at  Home that we could have bought them at our own Door from those whose Business it was to fetch them and though it had cost us something more yet the Difference of that Price was by no Means worth saving at so great a Hazard  But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads so Reflection upon the Folly of it is as ordinarily the Exercise of more Years or of the dear bought Experience of Time and so it was with me now and yet so deep had the Mistake taken root in my Temper that I could not satisfy my self in my Station but was continually poring upon the Means and Possibility of my Escape from this Place and that I may with the greater Pleasure to the Reader bring on the remaining Part of my Story it may not be improper to give some Account of my first Conceptions on the Subject of this foolish Scheme for my Escape and how and upon what Foundation I acted  I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Castle after my late Voyage to the Wreck my Frigate laid up and secur'd under Water as usual and my Condition restor'd to what it was before I had more Wealth indeed than I had before but was not at all the richer for I had no more use for it than the  Indians  of  Peru  had before the  Spaniards  came there  It was one of the Nights in the rainy Season in  March  the four and twentieth Year of my first setting Foot in this Island of Solitariness I was lying in my Bed or Hammock awake very well in Health had no Pain no Distemper no Uneasiness of Body no nor any Uneasiness of Mind more than ordinary but could by no means close my Eyes that is so as to sleep no not a Wink all Night long otherwise than as follows  It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd through that great thorowfare of the Brain the Memory in this Night's Time I run over the whole History of my Life in Miniature or by Abridgment  as I may call it  to my coming to this Island and also of the Part of my Life since I came to this Island In my Reflections upon the State of my Case since I came on Shore on this Island I was comparing the happy Posture of my Affairs in the first Years of my Habitation here compar'd to the Life of Anxiety Fear and Care which I had liv'd ever since I had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand not that I did not believe the Savages had frequented the Island even all the while and might have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore there but I had never known it and was incapable of any Apprehensions about it my Satisfaction was perfect though my Danger was the same and I was as happy in not knowing my Danger as if I had never really been expos'd to it This furnish'd my Thoughts with many very profitable Reflections and particularly this one How infinitely Good that Providence is which has provided in its Government of Mankind such narrow bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand Dangers the Sight of which if discover'd to him would distract his Mind and sink his Spirits he is kept serene and calm by having the Events of Things hid from his Eyes and knowing nothing the Dangers which surround him  After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me I came to reflect seriously upon the real Danger I had been in for so many Years in this very Island and how I had walk'd about in the greatest Security and with all possible Tranquillity  even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill a great Tree or the casual Approach of Night had been between me and the worst kind of Destruction  viz  That of falling into the Hands of Cannibals and Savages who would have seiz'd on me with the same View as I did of a Goat or a Turtle and have thought it no more a Crime to kill and devour me than I did of a Pidgeon or a Curlieu I would unjustly slander my self if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver to whose singular Protection I acknowledg'd with great Humility that all these unknown Deliverances were due and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless Hands  When these Thoughts were over my Head was for some time taken up in considering the Nature of these wretched Creatures I mean the Savages and how it came to pass in the World that the wise Governour of all Things should give up any of his Creatures to such Inhumanity nay to something so much below even Brutality it self as to devour its own kind but as this ended in some at that Time fruitless Speculations it occurr'd to me to enquire what Part of the World these Wretches liv'd in how far off the Coast was from whence they came what they ventur'd over so far from home for what kind of Boats they had and why I might not order my self and my Business so that I might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me  I never so much as troubl'd my self to consider what I should do with my self when I came thither what would become of me if I fell into the Hands of the Savages or how I should escape from them if they attempted me no nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the Coast and  not be attempted by some or other of them without any Possibility of delivering my self and if I should not fall into their Hands what I should do for Provision or whither I should bend my Course none of these Thoughts I say so much as came in my way but my Mind was wholly bent upon the Notion of my passing over in my Boat to the Main Land I look'd back upon my present Condition as the most miserable that could possibly be that I was not able to throw my self into any thing but Death that could be call'd worse that if I reached the Shore of the Main I might perhaps meet with Relief or I might coast along as I did on the Shore of  Africk  till I came to some inhabited Country and where I might find some Relief and after all perhaps I might fall in with some Christian Ship that might take me in and if the worse came to the worst I could but die which would put an end to all these Miseries at once Pray note all this was the fruit of a disturb'd Mind an impatient Temper made as it were desperate by the long Continuance of my Troubles and the Disappointments I had met in the Wreck I had been on board of and where I had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly long'd for  viz  Somebody to speak to and to learn some Knowledge from of the Place where I was and of the probable Means of my Deliverance I say I was agitated wholly by these Thoughts All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence and waiting the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven seem'd to be suspended and I had as it were no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing but to the Project of a Voyage to the Main which came upon me with such Force and such an Impetuosity of Desire that it was not to be resisted  When this had agitated my Thoughts for two Hours or more with such Violence that it set my very Blood into a Ferment and my Pulse beat as high as if I had been in a Feaver meerly with the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it Nature as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very Thought of it threw me into a sound Sleep one would have thought I should have dream'd of it But I did not nor of any Thing relating to it but I dream'd that as I was going out in the Morning as usual from my Castle I saw upon the Shore two  Canoes  and eleven Savages coming to Land and that they brought with them another Savage who they were going to kill in Order to eat him when on a sudden the Savage that they were going to kill jumpt away and ran for his Life and I thought in my Sleep that he came running into my little thick Grove before my Fortification to hide himself and that I seeing him alone and not perceiving that the other sought him that Way show'd my self to him and smiling upon him encourag'd him that he kneel'd down to me seeming to pray me to assist him upon which I shew'd my Ladder made him go up and carry'd him into my Cave and he became my Servant and that as soon as I had gotten this Man I said to my self now I may certainly venture to the main Land for this Fellow will serve me as a Pilot and will tell me what to do and whether to go for Provisions and whether not to go for fear of being devoured what Places to venture into and what to escape I wak'd with this Thought and was under such inexpressible Impressions of Joy at the Prospect of my Escape in my Dream that the Disappointments which I felt upon coming to my self and finding it was no more than a Dream were equally extravagant the  other Way and threw me into a very great Dejection of Spirit  Upon this however I made this Conclusion that my only Way to go about an Attempt for an Escape was if possible to get a Savage into my Possession and if possible it should be one of their Prisoners who they had condemn'd to be eaten and should bring thither to kill but these Thoughts still were attended with this Difficulty that it was impossible to effect this without attacking a whole Caravan of them and killing them all and this was not only a very desperate Attempt and might miscarry but on the other Hand I had greaty scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me and my Heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much Blood tho' it was for my Deliverance I need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd to me against this they being the same mention'd before but tho' I had other Reasons to offer now  viz  that those Men were Enemies to my Life and would devour me if they could that it was Selfpreservation in the highest Degree to deliver my self from this Death of a Life and was acting in my own Defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me and the like I say tho' these Things argued for it yet the Thoughts of shedding Humane Blood for my Deliverance were very Terrible to me and such as I could by no Means reconcile my self to a great while  However at last after many secret Disputes with my self and after great Perplexities about it for all these Arguments one Way and another struggl'd in my Head a long Time the eager prevailing Desire of Deliverance at length master'd all the rest and I resolv'd if possible to get one of those Savages into my Hands cost what it  would My next Thing then was to contrive how to do it and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on But as I could pitch upon no probable Means for it so I resolv'd to put my self upon the Watch to see them when they came on Shore and leave the rest to the Event taking such Measures as the Opportunity should present let be what would be  With these Resolutions in my Thoughts I set my self upon the Scout as often as possible and indeed so often till I was heartily tir'd of it for it was above a Year and Half that I waited and for great part of that Time went out to the  West  End and to the  South West  Corner of the Island almost every Day to see for Canoes but none appear'd This was very discouraging and began to trouble me much tho' I cannot say that it did in this Case as it had done some time before that  viz  wear off the Edge of my Desire to the Thing But the longer it seem'd to be delay'd the more eager I was for it in a Word I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these Savages and avoid being seen by them as I was now eager to be upon them  Besides I fancied my self able to manage One nay Two or Three Savages if I had them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me to do whatever I should direct them and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any Hurt It was a great while that I pleas'd my self with this Affair but nothing still presented all my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing for no Savages came near me for a great while  About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions and by long musing had as it were resolved them all into nothing for want of an Occasion to put them in Execution I was surpriz'd  one Morning early with seeing no less than five  Canoes  all on Shore together on my side the Island and the People who belong'd to them all landed and out of my sight The Number of them broke all my Measures for seeing so many and knowing that they always came four or six or sometimes more in a Boat I could not tell what to think of it or how to take my Measures to attack Twenty or Thirty Men single handed so I lay still in my Castle perplex'd and discomforted However I put my self into all the same Postures for an Attack that I had formerly provided and was just ready for Action if any Thing had presented having waited a good while listening to hear if they made any Noise at length being very impatient I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder and clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill by my two Stages as usual standing so however that my Head did not appear above the Hill so that they could not perceive me by any Means here I observ'd by the help of my Perspective Glass that they were no less than Thirty in Number that they had a Fire kindled that they had had Meat dress'd How they had cook'd it that I knew not or what it was but they were all Dancing in I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures their own Way round the Fire  While I was thus looking on them I perceived by my Perspective two miserable Wretches dragg'd from the Boats where it seems they were laid by and were now brought out for the Slaughter I perceived one of them immediately fell being knock'd down I suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword for that was their way and two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery while the other Victim was left standing by himself till they should be ready for  him In that very Moment this poor Wretch seeing himself a little at Liberty Nature inspir'd him with Hopes of Life and he started away from them and ran with incredible Swiftness along the Sands directly towards me I mean towards that part of the Coast where my Habitation was  I was dreadfully frighted that I must acknowledge when I perceived him to run my Way and especially when as I thought I saw him pursued by the whole Body and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming to pass and that he would certainly take shelter in my Grove but I could not depend by any means upon my Dream for the rest of it  viz  that the other Savages would not pursue him thither and find him there However I kept my Station and my Spirits began to recover when I found that there was not above three Men that follow'd him and still more was I encourag'd when I found that he outstrip'd them exceedingly in running and gain'd Ground of them so that if he could but hold it for half an Hour I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all  There was between them and my Castle the Creek which I mention'd often at the first part of my Story when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over or the poor Wretch would be taken there But when the Savage escaping came thither he made nothing of it tho' the Tide was then up but plunging in swam thro' in about Thirty Strokes or thereabouts landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swiftness when the Three Persons came to the Creek I found that Two of them could Swim but the Third cou'd not and that standing on the other Side he look'd at the other but went no further and soon after went  softly back again which as it happen'd was very well for him in the main  I observ'd that the two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the Creek as the Fellow was that fled from them It came now very warmly upon my Thoughts and indeed irresistibly that now was my Time to get me a Servant and perhaps a Companion or Assistant and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to save this poor Creature's Life I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible Expedition fetches my two Guns for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders as I observ'd above and getting up again with the same haste to the Top of the Hill I cross'd toward the Sea and having a very short Cut and all down Hill clapp'd my self in the way between the Pursuers and the Pursu'd hallowing aloud to him that fled who looking back was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as at them but I beckon'd with my Hand to him to come back and in the mean time I slowly advanc'd towards the two that follow'd then rushing at once upon the foremost I knock'd him down with the Stock of my Piece I was loath to fire because I would not have the rest hear though at that distance it would not have been easily heard and being out of Sight of the Smoke too they wou'd not have easily known what to make of it Having knock'd this Fellow down the other who pursu'd with him stopp'd as if he had been frighted and I advanc'd apace towards him but as I came nearer I perceiv'd presently he had a Bow and Arrow and was fitting it to shoot at me so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first which I did and kill'd him at the first Shoot the poor Savage who fled but had stopp'd though he saw both his Enemies fallen and kill'd as he thought yet  was so frighted with the Fire and Noise of my Piece that he stood Stock still and neither came forward or went backward tho' he seem'd rather enclin'd to fly still than to come on I hollow'd again to him and made Signs to come forward which he easily understood and came a little way then stopp'd again and then a little further and stopp'd again and I cou'd then perceive that he stood trembling as if he had been taken Prisoner and had just been to be kill'd as his two Enemies were I beckon'd him again to come to me and gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of and he came nearer and nearer kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement for my saving his Life I smil'd at him and look'd pleasantly and beckon'd to him to come still nearer at length he came close to me and then he kneel'd down again kiss'd the Ground and laid his Head upon the Ground and taking me by the Foot set my Foot upon his Head this it seems was in token of swearing to be my Slave for ever I took him up and made much of him and encourag'd him all I could But there was more work to do yet for I perceived the Savage who I knock'd down was not kill'd but stunn'd with the blow and began to come to himself so I pointed to him and showing him the Savage that he was not dead upon this he spoke some Words to me and though I could not understand them yet I thought they were pleasant to hear for they were the first sound of a Man's Voice that I had heard  my own excepted  for above Twenty Five Years But there was no time for such Reflections now the Savage who was knock'd down recover'd himself so far as to sit up upon the Ground and I perceived that my Savage began to be afraid but when I saw that I presented my other  Piece at the Man as if I would shoot him upon this my Savage  for so I call him now  made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword which hung naked in a Belt by my side so I did he no sooner had it but he runs to his Enemy and at one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly no Executioner in  Germany  could have done it sooner or better which I thought very strange for one who I had Reason to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before except their own Wooden Swords however it seems as I learn'd afterwards they make their Wooden Swords so sharp so heavy and the Wood is so hard that they will cut off Heads even with them ay and Arms and that at one blow too when he had done this he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph and brought me the Sword again and with abundance of Gestures which I did not understand laid it down with the Head of the Savage that he had kill'd just before me  But that which astonish'd him most was to know how I had kill'd the other Indian so far off so pointing to him he made Signs to me to let him go to him so I bad him go as well as I could when he came to him he stood like one amaz'd looking at him turn'd him first on one side then on t'other look'd at the Wound the Bullet had made which it seems was just in his Breast where it had made a Hole and no great Quantity of Blood had follow'd but he had bled inwardly for he was quite dead He took up his Bow and Arrows and came back so I turn'd to go away and beckon'd to him to follow me making Signs to him that more might come after them  Upon this he sign'd to me that he should bury them with Sand that they might not be seen by the rest if they follow'd and so I made Signs again to him to do so he fell to Work and in an instant he  had scrap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands big enough to bury the first in and then dragg'd him into it and cover'd him and did so also by the other I believe he had bury'd them both in a Quarter of an Hour then calling him away I carry'd him not to my Castle but quite away to my Cave on the farther Part of the Island so I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part  viz  That he came into my Grove for shelter  Here I gave him Bread and a Bunch of Raisins to eat and a Draught of Water which I found he was indeed in great Distress for by his Running and having refresh'd him I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep pointing to a Place where I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw and a Blanket upon it which I used to sleep upon my self sometimes so the poor Creature laid down and went to sleep  He was a comely handsome Fellow perfectly well made with straight strong Limbs not too large tall and well shap'd and as I reckon about twenty six Years of Age He had a very good Countenance not a fierce and surly Aspect but seem'd to have something very manly in his Face and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an  European  in his Countenance too especially when he smil'd His Hair was long and black not curl'd like Wool his Forehead very high and large and a great Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes The Colour of his Skin was not quite black but very tawny and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny as the  Brasilians  and  Virginians  and other Natives of  America  are but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour that had in it something very agreeable tho' not very easy to describe His Face was round and plump his Nose small not flat like the Negroes a very good Mouth thin Lips and his  fine Teeth well set and white as Ivory After he had slumber'd rather than slept about half an Hour he wak'd again and comes out of the Cave to me for I had been milking my Goats which I had in the Enclosure just by When he espy'd me he came running to me laying himself down again upon the Ground with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful Disposition making a many antick Gestures to show it At last he lays his Head flat upon the Ground close to my Foot and sets my other Foot upon his Head as he had done before and after this made all the Signs to me of Subjection Servitude and Submission imaginable to let me know how he would serve me as long as he liv'd I understood him in many Things and let him know I was very well pleas'd with him in a little Time I began to speak to him and teach him to speak to me and first I made him know his Name should be  Friday  which was the Day I sav'd his Life I call'd him so for the Memory of the Time I likewise taught him to say  Master  and then let him know that was to be my Name I likewise taught him to say YES and NO and to know the Meaning of them I gave him some Milk in an earthen Pot and let him see me Drink it before him and sop my Bread in it and I gave him a Cake of Bread to do the like which he quickly comply'd with and made Signs that it was very good for him  I kept there with him all that Night but as soon as it was Day I beckon'd to him to come with me and let him know I would give him some Cloaths at which he seem'd very glad for he was stark naked As we went by the Place where he had bury'd the two Men he pointed exactly to the Place and shew'd me the Marks that he had made to find them again making Signs to me  that we should dig them up again and eat them at this I appear'd very angry express'd my Abhorrence of it made as if I would vomit at the Thoughts of it and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away which he did immediately with great Submission I then led him up to the Top of the Hill to see if his Enemies were gone and pulling out my Glass I look'd and saw plainly the Place where they had been but no appearance of them or of their  Canoes  so that it was plain they were gone and had left their two Comrades behind them without any search after them  But I was not content with this Discovery but having now more Courage and consequently more Curiosity I takes my Man  Friday  with me giving him the Sword in his Hand with the Bow and Arrows at his Back which I found he could use very dextrously making him carry one Gun for me and I two for my self and away we march'd to the Place where these Creatures had been for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence of them When I came to the Place my very Blood ran chill in my Veins and my Heart sunk within me at the Horror of the Spectacle Indeed it was a dreadful Sight at least it was so to me though  Friday  made nothing of it The Place was cover'd with humane Bones the Ground dy'd with their Blood great Pieces of Flesh left here and there half eaten mangl'd and scorch'd and in short all the Tokens of the triumphant Feast they had been making there after a Victory over their Enemies I saw three Skulls five Hands and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet and abundance of other Parts of the Bodies and  Friday  by his Signs made me understand that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon that three of them were eaten up  and that he pointing to himself was the fourth That there had been a great Battle between them and their next King whose Subjects it seems he had been one of and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners all which were carry'd to several Places by those that had taken them in the Fight in order to feast upon them as was done here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither  I caus'd  Friday  to gather all the Skulls Bones Flesh and whatever remain'd and lay them together on a Heap and make a great Fire upon it and burn them all to Ashes I found  Friday  had still a hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh and was still a Cannibal in his Nature but I discover'd so much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of it and at the least Appearance of it that he durst not discover it for I had by some Means let him know that I would kill him if he offer'd it  When we had done this we came back to our Castle and there I fell to work for my Man  Friday  and first of all I gave him a pair of Linnen Drawers which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chest I mention'd and which I found in the Wreck and which with a little Alteration fitted him very well then I made him a Jerkin of Goat'sskin as well as my Skill would allow and I was now grown a tollerable good Taylor and I gave him a Cap which I had made of a Hareskin very convenient and fashionable enough and thus he was cloath'd for the present tollerably well and was mighty well pleas'd to see himself almost as well cloath'd as his Master It is true he went awkardly in these Things at first wearing the Drawers was very awkard to him and the Sleeves of the Wastcoat gall'd his Shoulders and the inside of his Arms but a little easing them where he complain'd  they hurt him and using himself to them at length he took to them very well  The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him I began to consider where I should lodge him and that I might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy my self I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications in the inside of the last and in the outside of the first and as there was a Door or Entrance there into my Cave I made a formal fram'd Door Case and a Door to it of Boards and set it up in the Passage a little within the Entrance and causing the Door to open on the inside I barr'd it up in the Night taking in my Ladders too so that  Friday  could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall without making so much Noise in getting over that it must needs waken me for my first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles covering all my Tent and leaning up to the side of the Hill which was again laid cross with smaller Sticks instead of Laths and then thatch'd over a great Thickness with the Rice Straw which was strong like Reeds and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in or out by the Ladder I had plac'd a kind of Trapdoor which if it had been attempted on the outside would not have open'd at all but would have fallen down and made a great Noise and as to Weapons I took them all in to my Side every Night  But I needed none of all this Precaution for never Man had a more faithful loving sincere Servant than  Friday  was to me without Passions Sullenness or Designs perfectly oblig'd and engag'd his very Affections were ty'd to me like those of a Child to a Father and I dare say he would have sacrific'd his Life for the saving mine upon any occasion whatsoever the many Testimonies  he gave me of this put it out of doubt and soon convinc'd me that I needed to use no Precautions as to my Safety on his Account  This frequently gave me occasion to observe and that with wonder that however it had pleas'd God in his Providence and in the Government of the Works of his Hands to take from so great a Part of the World of his Creatures the best uses to which their Faculties and the Powers of their Souls are adapted yet that he has bestow'd upon them the same Powers the same Reason the same Affections the same Sentiments of Kindness and Obligation the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs the same Sense of Gratitude Sincerity Fidelity and all the Capacities of doing Good and receiving Good that he has given to us and that when he pleases to offer to them Occasions of exerting these they are as ready nay more ready to apply them to the right Uses for which they were bestow'd than we are and this made me very melancholly sometimes in reflecting as the several Occasions presented how mean a Use we make of all these even though we have these Powers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction the Spirit of God and by the Knowledge of his Word added to our Understanding and why it has pleas'd God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many Millions of Souls who if I might judge by this poor Savage would make a much better use of it than we did  From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of  Providence  and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a Disposition of Things that should hide that Light from some and reveal it to others and yet expect a like Duty from both But I shut it up and check'd my Thoughts with this Conclusion st That we  did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd but that as God was necessarily and by the Nature of his Being infinitely Holy and Just so it could not be but that if these Creatures were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself it was on account of sinning against that Light which as the Scripture says was a Law to themselves and by such Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge to be just tho' the Foundation was not discover'd to us And d that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the Potter no Vessel could say to him Why hast thou form'd me thus  But to return to my New Companion I was greatly delighted with him and made it my Business to teach him every Thing that was proper to make him useful handy and helpful but especially to make him speak and understand me when I spake and he was the aptest Schollar that ever was and particularly was so merry so constantly diligent and so pleased when he cou'd but understand me or make me understand him that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him and now my Life began to be so easy that I began to say to my self that could I but have been safe from more Savages I cared not if I was never to remove from the place while I lived  After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle I thought that in order to bring  Friday  off from his horrid way of feeding and from the Relish of a Cannibal's Stomach I ought to let him taste other Flesh so I took him out with me one Morning to the Woods I went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock and bring him home and dress it But as I was going I saw a She Goat lying down in the Shade and two young Kids sitting by her I catch'd hold of  Friday  hold says I stand still and made Signs to him  not to stir immediately I presented my Piece shot and kill'd one of the Kids The poor Creature who had at a Distance indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy but did not know or could imagine how it was done was sensibly surpriz'd trembled and shook and look'd so amaz'd that I thought he would have sunk down He did not see the Kid I shot at or perceive I had kill'd it but ripp'd up his Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded and as I found presently thought I was resolv'd to kill him for he came and kneel'd down to me and embraceing my Knees said a great many Things I did not understand but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him  I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm and taking him up by the Hand laugh'd at him and pointed to the Kid which I had kill'd beckoned to him to run and fetch it which he did and while he was wondering and looking to see how the Creature was kill'd I loaded my Gun again and by and by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot so to let  Friday  understand a little what I would do I call'd him to me again pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot tho' I thought it had been a Hawk I say pointing to the Parrot and to my Gun and to the Ground under the Parrot to let him see I would make it fall I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that Bird according I fir'd and bad him look and immediately he saw the Parrot fall he stood like one frighted again notwithstanding all I had said to him and I found he was the more amaz'd because he did not see me put any Thing into the Gun but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and Destruction in that Thing able to kill Man Beast  Bird or any Thing near or far off and the Astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear off for a long Time and I believe if I would have let him he would have worshipp'd me and my Gun As for the Gun it self he would not so much as touch it for several Days after but would speak to it and talk to it as if it had answer'd him when he was by himself which as I afterwards learn'd of him was to desire it not to kill him  Well after his Astonishment was a little over at this I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird I had shot which he did but stay'd some Time for the Parrot not being quite dead was flutter'd away a good way off from the Place where she fell however he found her took her up and brought her to me and as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance about the Gun before I took this Advantage to charge the Gun again and not let him see me do it that I might be ready for any other Mark that might present but nothing more offer'd at that Time so I brought home the Kid and the same Evening I took the Skin off and cut it out as well as I could and having a Pot for that purpose I boil'd or stew'd some of the Flesh and made some very good Broth and after I had begun to eat some I gave some to my Man who seem'd very glad of it and lik'd it very well but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat Salt with it he made a Sign to me that the Salt was not good to eat and putting a little into his own Mouth he seem'd to nauseate it and would spit and sputter at it washing his Mouth with fresh Water after it on the other hand I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of Salt as fast as he had done at the Salt but it would not do he  would never care for Salt with his Meat or in his Broth at least not a great while and then but a very little  Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth I was resolv'd to feast him the next Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid this I did by hanging it before the Fire in a String as I had seen many People do in  England  setting two Poles up one on each side the Fire and one cross on the Top and tying the String to the Crossstick letting the Meat turn continually This  Friday  admir'd very much but when he came to taste the Flesh he took so many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it that I could not but understand him and at last he told me he would never eat Man's Flesh any more which I was very glad to hear  The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out and sifting it in the manner I us'd to do as I observ'd before and he soon understood how to do it as well as I especially after he had seen what the Meaning of it was and that it was to make Bread of for after that I let him see me make my Bread and bake it too and in a little Time  Friday  was able to do all the Work for me as well as I could do it my self  I begun now to consider that having two Mouths to feed instead of one I must provide more Ground for my Harvest and plant a larger Quantity of Corn than I us'd to do so I mark'd out a larger Piece of Land and began the Fence in the same Manner as before in which  Friday  not only work'd very willingly and very hard but did it very chearfully and I told him what it was for that it was for Corn to make more Bread because he was now with me and that I might have enough for him and my self too He appear'd very sensible of that Part and let me know that he thought I had  much more Labour upon me on his Account than I had for my self and that he would work the harder for me if I would tell him what to do  This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place  Friday  began to talk pretty well and understand the Names of almost every Thing I had occasion to call for and of every Place I had to send him to and talk'd a great deal to me so that in short I began now to have some Use for my Tongue again which indeed I had very little occasion for before that is to say  about Speech  besides the Pleasure of talking to him I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself his simple unfeign'd Honesty appear'd to me more and more every Day and I began really to love the Creature and on his Side I believe he lov'd me more than it was possible for him ever to love any Thing before  I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his own Country again and having learn'd him  English  so well that he could answer me almost any Questions I ask'd him whether the Nation that he belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle at which he smil'd and said yes yes we always fight the better that is he meant always get the better in Fight and so we began the following Discourse You always fight the better said I How came you to be taken Prisoner then  Friday  Friday  My Nation beat much for all that  Master  How beat if your Nation beat them how come you to be taken  Friday  They more many than my Nation in the Place where me was they take one two three and me my Nation over beat them in the yonder Place where me no was there my Nation take one two great Thousand  Master  But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands of your Enemies then  Friday  They run one two three and me and make go in the  Canoe  my Nation have no  Canoe  that time  Master  Well  Friday  and What does your Nation do with the Men they take do they carry them away and eat them as these did  Friday  Yes my Nation eat Man's too eat all up  Master  Where do they carry them  Friday  Go to other Place where they think  Master  Do they come hither  Friday  Yes yes they come hither come other else Place  Master  Have you been here with them  Friday  Yes I been here  points to the  N W  Side of the Island  which it seems was their Side  By this I understood that my Man  Friday  had formerly been among the Savages who us'd to come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island on the same Man eating Occasions that he was now brought for and sometime after when I took the Courage to carry him to that Side being the same I formerly mention'd he presently knew the Place and told me he was there once when they eat up twenty Men two Women and one Child he could not tell Twenty in  English  but he numbred them by laying so many Stones on a Row and pointing to me to tell them over  I have told this Passage because it introduces what follows that after I had had this Discourse with him I ask'd him how far it was from our Island to the Shore and whether the  Canoes  were not often lost he told me there was no Danger no  Canoes  ever lost but that after a little way out to the Sea there was a Current and Wind always one way in the Morning the other in the Afternoon  This I understood to be no more than the Sets of the Tide as going out or coming in but I afterwards understood it was occasion'd by the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River  Oroonooko  in the Mouth or the Gulph of which River as I found afterwards our Island lay and this Land which I perceiv'd to the  W  and  N W  was the great Island  Trinidad  on the  North  Point of the Mouth of the River I ask'd  Friday  a thousand Questions about the Country the Inhabitants the Sea the Coast and what Nation were near he told me all he knew with the greatest Openness imaginable I ask'd him the Names of the several Nations of his Sort of People but could get no other Name than  Caribs  from whence I easily understood that these were the  Caribbees  which our Maps place on the Part of  America  which reaches from the Mouth of the River  Oroonooko  to  Guiana  and onwards to  St Martha  He told me that up a great way beyond the Moon that was beyond the Setting of the Moon which must be  W  from their Country there dwelt white bearded Men like me and pointed to my great Whiskers which I mention'd before and that they had kill'd  much Mans  that was his Word by all which I understood he meant the  Spaniards  whose Cruelties in  America  had been spread over the whole Countries and was remember'd by all the Nations from Father to Son  I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island and get among those white Men he told me yes yes I might go  in two Canoe  I could not understand what he meant or make him describe to me what he meant by  two Canoe  till at last with great Difficulty I found he meant it must be in a large great Boat as big as  two Canoes    This Part of  Friday  's Discourse began to relish with me very well and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes that one Time or other I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place and that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do it  During the long Time that  Friday  has now been with me and that he began to speak to me and understand me I was not wanting to lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind particularly I ask'd him one Time who made him The poor Creature did not understand me at all but thought I had ask'd who was his Father but I took it by another handle and ask'd him who made the Sea the Ground we walk'd on and the Hills and Woods he told me it was one old  Benamuckee  that liv'd beyond all He could describe nothing of this great Person but that he was very old much older he said than the Sea or the Land than the Moon or the Stars I ask'd him then if this old Person had made all Things why did not all Things worship him he look'd very grave and with a perfect Look of Innocence said  All Things do say O to him  I ask'd him if the People who die in his Country went away any where he said yes they all went to  Benamuckee  then I ask'd him whether these they eat up went thither too he said yes  From these Things I began to instruct him in the Knowledge of the true God I told him that the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there pointing up towards Heaven That he governs the World by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it That he was omnipotent could do every Thing for us give every Thing to us take every Thing from us and thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes He listned with great Attention  and receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion of  Jesus Christ  being sent to redeem us and of the Manner of making our Prayers to God and his being able to hear us even into Heaven he told me one Day that if our God could hear us up beyond the Sun he must needs be a greater God than their  Benamuckee  who liv'd but a little way off and yet could not hear till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt to speak to him I ask'd him if ever he went thither to speak to him he said no they never went that were young Men none went thither but the old Men who he call'd their  Oowocakee  that is as I made him explain it to me their Religious or Clergy and that they went to say  O  so he called saying Prayers and then came back and told them what  Benamuckee  said By this I observ'd That there is  Priestcraft  even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World and the Policy of making a secret Religion in order to preserve the Veneration of the People to the Clergy is not only to be found in the  Roman  but perhaps among all Religions in the World even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages  I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud to my Man  Friday  and told him that the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains to say  O  to their God  Benamuckee  was a Cheat and their bringing Word from thence what he said was much more so that if they met with any Answer or spake with any one there it must be with an evil Spirit And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil the Original of him his Rebellion against God his Enmity to Man the Reason of it his setting himself up in the dark Parts of the World to be Worship'd instead of God and as God and the many Stratagems  he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruine how he had a secret access to our Passions and to our Affections to adapt his Snares so to our Inclinations as to cause us even to be our own Tempters and to run upon our Destruction by our own Choice  I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his Mind about the Devil as it was about the Being of a God Nature assisted all my Arguments to Evidence to him even the Necessity of a great first Cause and overruling governing Power a secret directing Providence and of the Equity and Justice of paying Homage to him that made us and the like But there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit of his Original his Being his Nature and above all of his Inclination to do Evil and to draw us in to do so too and the poor Creature puzzl'd me once in such a manner by a Question meerly natural and innocent that I scarce knew what to say to him I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God his Omnipotence his dreadful Nature to Sin his being a consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity▪ how as he had made us all he could destroy us and all the World in a Moment and he listen'd with great Seriousness to me all the while  After this I had been telling him how the Devil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good Designs of Providence and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World and the like Well says  Friday  but you say God is so strong so great is he not much strong much might as the Devil Yes yes says I  Friday  God is stronger than the Devil God is above the Devil and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our Feet  and enable us to resist his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts  But  says he again  if God much strong much might as the Devil why God no kill the Devil so make him no more do wicked  I was strangely surpriz'd at his Question and after all tho' I was now an old Man yet I was but a young Doctor and ill enough quallified for a Casuist or a Solver of Difficulties And at first I could not tell what to say so I pretended not to hear him and ask'd him what he said But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his Question so that he repeated it in the very same broken Words as above By this time I had recovered my self a little and I said  God will at last punish him severely  he is  reserv'd for the Judgment and is to be cast into the BottomlessPit to dwell with everlasting Fire  This did not satisfie  Friday  but he returns upon me repeating my Words RESERVE AT LAST  me no underderstand but Why not kill the Devil now not kill great ago  You may as well ask me  said I  Why God does not kill you and I when we do wicked Things here that offend him We are preserv'd to repent and be pardon'd He muses a while at this  well well  says he mighty affectionately  that well so you I Devil all wicked all preserve repent God pardon all  Here I was run down again by him to the last Degree and it was a Testimony to me how the meer Notions of Nature though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a God and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being of God as the Consequence of our Nature yet nothing but divine Revelation can from the Knowledge of  Jesus Christ  and of a Redemption purchas'd for us of a Mediator of the new Covenant and of an Intercessor at the Footstool of God's Throne I say nothing but a Revelation from Heaven can form these in  the Soul and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour  Jesus Christ  I mean the Word of God and the Spirit of God promis'd for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men in the saving Knowledge of God and the Means of Salvation  I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my Man rising up hastily as upon some sudden Occasion of going out then sending him for something a good way off I seriously pray'd to God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor Savage assisting by his Spirit the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature to receive the Light of the Knowledge of God in  Christ  reconciling him to himself and would guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God as his Conscience might be convinc'd his Eyes open'd and his Soul sav'd When he came again to me I entred into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the World and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd from Heaven  viz  of Repentance towards God and Faith in our Blessed Lord  Jesus  I then explain'd to him as well as I could why our Blessed Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels but the Seed of  Abraham  and how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption that he came only to the lost Sheep of the House of  Israel  and the like  I had  God knows  more Sincerity than Knowledge in all the Methods I took for this poor Creature's Instruction and must acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find That in laying Things open to him I really inform'd and instructed my self in many Things that either I did not know or had not fully consider'd  before but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind upon my searching into them for the Information of this poor Savage and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things upon this Occasion than ever I felt before so that whether this poor wild Wretch was the better for me or no I had great Reason to be thankful that ever he came to me My Grief set lighter upon me my Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond Measure and when I reflected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin'd to I had not only been moved my self to look up to Heaven and to seek to the Hand that had brought me there but was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to save the Life and  for ought I knew  the Soul of a poor Savage and bring him to the true Knowledge of Religion and of the Christian Doctrine that he might know Christ Jesus  to know whom is Life eternal  I say when I reflected upon all these Things a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul and I frequently rejoyc'd that ever I was brought to this Place which I had so often thought the most dreadful of all Afflictions that could possibly have befallen me  In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my Time and the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between  Friday  and I was such as made the three Years which we liv'd there together perfectly and compleatly happy  if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form'd in a sublunary State  The Savage was now a good Christian a much better than I though I have reason to hope and bless God for it that we were equally penitent and comforted restor'd Penitents we had here the Word of God to read and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in  England    I always apply'd my self in Reading the Scripture to let him know as well as I could the Meaning of what I read and he again by his serious Enquiries and Questionings made me  as I said before  a much better Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge than I should ever have been by my own private meer Reading Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also from Experience in this retir'd Part of my Life  viz  How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing it is that the Knowledge of God and of the Doctrine of Salvation by  Christ Jesus  is so plainly laid down in the Word of God so easy to be receiv'd and understood That as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my Duty to carry me directly on to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation to a stated Reformation in Practice and Obedience to all God's Commands and this without any Teacher or Instructer I mean humane so the same plain Instruction sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this Savage Creature and bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few equal to him in my Life  As to all the Disputes Wranglings Strife and Contention which has happen'd in the World about Religion whether Niceties in Doctrines or Schemes of Church Government they were all perfectly useless to us as for ought I can yet see they have been to all the rest of the World We had the  sure Guide  to Heaven  viz  The Word of God and we had  blessed be God  comfortable Views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by his Word  leading us into all Truth  and making us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of his Word and I cannot see the least Use that the greatest  Knowledge of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions in the World would have been to us if we could have obtain'd it but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things and take every Part in its order  After  Friday  and I became more intimately acquainted and that he could understand almost all I said to him and speak fluently though in broken  English  to me I acquainted him with my own Story or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the Place how I had liv'd there and how long I let him into the Mystery for such it was to him of Gunpowder and Bullet and taught him how to shoot I gave him a Knife which he was wonderfully delighted with and I made him a Belt with a Frog hanging to it such as in  England  we wear Hangers in and in the Frog instead of a Hanger I gave him a Hatchet which was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases but much more useful upon other Occasions  I describ'd to him the Country of  Europe  and particularly  England  which I came from how we liv'd how we worshipp'd God how we behav'd to one another and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World I gave him an Account of the Wreck which I had been on board of and shew'd him as near as I could the Place where she lay but she was all beaten in Pieces before and gone  I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat which we lost when we escap'd and which I could not stir with my whole Strength then but was now fallen almost all to Pieces Upon seeing this Boat  Friday  stood musing a great while and said nothing I ask'd him what it was he study'd upon at last says he  me see such Boat like come to Place at my Nation    I did not understand him a good while but at last when I had examin'd farther into it I understood  by him that a Boat such as that had been came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd that is as he explain'd it was driven thither by Stress of Weather I presently imagin'd that some  European  Ship must have been cast away upon their Coast and the Boat might get loose and drive a Shore but was so dull that I never once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither much less whence they might come so I only enquir'd after a Description of the Boat  Friday  describ'd the Boat to me well enough but brought me better to understand him when he added with some Warmth  we save the white Mans from drown  Then I presently ask'd him if there was any  white Mans  as he call'd them in the Boat  yes  he said  the Boat full white Mans  I ask'd him how many he told upon his Fingers seventeen I ask'd him then what become of them he told me  they live they dwell at my Nation    This put new Thoughts into my Head for I presently imagin'd that these might be the Men belonging to the Ship that was cast away in Sight of  my Island  as I now call it and who after the Ship was struck on the Rock and they saw her inevitably lost had sav'd themselves in their Boat and were landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages  Upon this I enquir'd of him more critically What was become of them He assur'd me they lived still there that they had been there about four Years that the Savages let them alone and gave them Victuals to live I ask'd him How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them He said  No they make Brother with them  that is as I understood him a Truce And then he added  They no eat Mans but when make the War fight  that is to  say they never eat any Men but such as come to fight with them and are taken in Battle  It was after this some considerable Time that being upon the Top of the Hill at the  East  Side of the Island from whence as I have said I had in a clear Day discover'd the Main or Continent of  America Friday  the Weather being very serene looks very earnestly towards the Main Land and in a kind of Surprise falls a jumping and dancing and calls out to me for I was at some Distance from him I ask'd him What was the Matter  O joy  Says he  O glad There see my Country there my Nation  I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in his Face and his Eyes sparkled and his Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again and this Observation of mine put a great many Thoughts into me which made me at first not so easy about my new Man  Friday  as I was before and I made no doubt but that if  Friday  could get back to his own Nation again he would not only forget all his Religion but all his Obligation to me and would be forward enough to give his Countrymen an Account of me and come back perhaps with a hundred or two of them and make a Feast upon me at which he might be as merry as he us'd to be with those of his Enemies when they were taken in War  But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very much for which I was very sorry afterwards However as my Jealousy encreased and held me some Weeks I was a little more circumspect and not so familiar and kind to him as before in which I was certainly in the Wrong too the honest grateful Creature having no thought about it but what consisted with the best Principles both  as a religious Christian and as a grateful Friend  as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction  While my Jealousy of him lasted you may be sure I was every Day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new Thoughts which I suspected were in him but I found every thing he said was so Honest and so Innocent that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion and in spight of all my Uneasiness he made me at last entirely his own again nor did he in the least perceive that I was Uneasie and therefore I could not suspect him of Deceit  One Day walking up the same Hill but the Weather being haizy at Sea so that we could not see the Continent I call'd to him and said  Friday  do not you wish your self in your own Country your own Nation Yes he said  he be much O glad to be at his own Nation  What would you do there said I would you turn Wild again eat Mens Flesh again and be a Savage as you were before He lookt full of Concern and shaking his Head said  No no  Friday  tell them to live Good  tell them  to pray God  tell them  to eat Cornbread Cattleflesh Milk no eat Man again  Why then said I to him  They will kill you  He look'd grave at that and then said  No they no kill me they willing love learn  He meant by this they would be willing to learn He added they learn'd much of the BeardedMans that come in the Boat Then I as'd him if he would go back to them He smil'd at that and told me he could not swim so far I told him I would make a  Canoe  for him He told me  he would go if I would go with him  I go says I why they will Eat me if I come there No no says he  me make they no Eat you me make they much Love you  He meant he would tell them how I had kill'd his Enemies and sav'd his Life and so he  would make them love me then he told me as well as he could how kind they were to seventeen Whitemen or Beardedmen as he call'd them who came on Shore there in Distress  From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over and see if I could possible joyn with these Beardedmen who I made no doubt were  Spaniards  or  Portuguese  not doubting but if I could we might find some Method to Escape from thence being upon the Continent and a good Company together better than I could from an Island Miles off the Shore and alone without Help So after some Days I took  Friday  to work again by way of Discourse and told him I would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate which lay on the other Side of the Island and having clear'd it of Water for I always kept it sunk in the Water I brought it out shewed it him and we both went into it  I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it would make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could so when he was in I said to him Well now  Friday  shall we go to your Nation He look'd very dull at my saying so which it seems was because he thought the Boat too small to go so far I told him then I had a bigger so the next Day I went to the Place where the first Boat lay which I had made but which I could not get into Water He said that was big enough but then as I had taken no Care of it and it had lain two or three and twenty Years there the Sun had split and dry'd it that it was in a manner rotten  Friday  told me such a Boat would do very well and would carry  much enough Vittle Drink Bread  that was his Way of Talking  Upon the whole I was by this Time so fix'd upon my Design of going over with him to the Continent that I told him we would go and make one as big as that and he should go home in it He answer'd not one Word but look'd very grave and sad I ask'd him what was the matter with him He ask'd me again thus  Why you angry mad with  Friday  what me done  I ask'd him what he meant I told him I was not angry with him at all  No angry No angry  says he repeating the Words several Times  Why send  Friday  home away to my Nation  Why says I  Friday  did you not say you wish'd you were there  Yes yes  says he  wish be both there no wish  Friday  there no Master there  In a Word he would not think of going there without me  I go there  Friday says I  what shall I do there  He turn'd very quick upon me at this  You do great deal much good  says he  you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans you tell them know God pray God and live new Life Alas  Friday says I  thou knowest not what thou sayest I am but an ignorant Man my self Yes yes  says he  you teachee me Good you teachee them Good No no  Friday says I  you shall go without me leave me here to live by my self as I did before  He look'd confus'd again at that Word and running to one of the Hatchets which he used to wear he takes it up hastily comes and gives it me  What must I do with this  says I to him  You take kill  Friday says he  What must I kill you for  said I again He returns very quick  What you send  Friday  away for take kill  Friday  no send  Friday  away  This he spoke so earnestly that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes In a Word I so plainly discover'd the utmost Affection in him to me and a firm Resolution in him that I told him then and often after that I would never send him away from me if he was willing to stay with me  Upon the whole as I found by all his Discourse a settled Affection to me and that nothing should part him from me so I found all the Foundation of his Desire to go to his own Country was laid in his ardent Affection to the People and his Hopes of my doing them good a Thing which as I had no Notion of my self so I had not the least Thought or Intention or Desire of undertaking it But still I found a strong Inclination to my attempting an Escape as above founded on the Supposition gather'd from the Discourse  viz  That there were seventeen bearded Men there and therefore without any more Delay I went to Work with  Friday  to find out a great Tree proper to fell and make a large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage There were Trees enough in the Island to have built a little Fleet not of Periagua's and Canoes but even of good large Vessels But the main Thing I look'd at was to get one so near the Water that we might launch it when it was made to avoid the Mistake I committed at first  At last  Friday  pitch'd upon a Tree for I found he knew much better than I what kind of Wood was fittest for it nor can I tell to this Day what Wood to call the Tree we cut down except that it was very like the Tree we call  Fustic  or between that and the  Nicaragua  Wood for it was much of the same Colour and Smell  Friday  was for burning the Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for a Boat But I shew'd him how rather to cut it out with Tools which after I had shew'd him how to use he did very handily and in about a Month's hard Labour we finished it and made it very handsome especially when with our Axes which I shew'd him how to handle we cut and hew'd the outside into the true Shape of a Boat after this however it cost us near a Fortnight's Time to get  her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rowlers into the Water But when she was in she would have carry'd twenty Men with great Ease  When she was in the Water and tho' she was so big it amazed me to see with what Dexterity and how swift my Man  Friday  would  her and paddle her along so I ask'd him  would and if we might venture over in her  Ye  ▪ he said  he venture over in her very well tho' great blow Wind  However I had a farther Design that he knew nothing of and that was to make a Mast and Sail and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable As to a Mast that was easy enough to get so I pitch'd upon a strait young CedarTree which I found near the Place and which there was great Plenty of in the Island and I set  Friday  to Work to cut it down and gave him Directions how to shape and order it But as to the Sail that was my particular Care I knew I had old Sails or rather Pieces of old Sails enough but as I had had them now six and twenty Years by me and had not been very careful to preserve them not imagining that I should ever have this kind of Use for them I did not doubt but they were all rotten and indeed most of them were so however I found two Pieces which appear'd pretty good and with these I went to Work and with a great deal of Pains and awkward tedious stitching you may be sure for Want of Needles I at length made a three Corner'd ugly Thing like what we call in  England  a Shoulder of Mutton Sail to go with a Boom at bottom and a little short Sprit at the Top such as usually our Ship's LongBoats sail with and such as I best knew how to manage because it was such a one as I had to the Boat in which I made my Escape from  Barbary  as related in the first Part of my Story  I was near two Months performing this last Work  viz  rigging and fitting my Mast and Sails for I finish'd them very compleat making a small Stay and a Sail or Foresail to it to assist if we should turn to Windward and which was more than all I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her to steer with and though I was but a bungling Shipwright yet as I knew the Usefulness and even Necessity of such a Thing I apply'd my self with so much Pains to do it that at last I brought it to pass though considering the many dull Contrivances I had for it that fail'd I think it cost me almost as much Labour as making the Boat  After all this was done too I had my Man  Friday  to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation of my Boat for though he knew very well how to paddle a  Canoe  he knew nothing what belong'd to a Sail and a Rudder and was the most amaz'd when he saw me work the Boat too and again in the Sea by the Rudder and how the Sail gyb'd and fill'd this way or that way as the Course we sail'd chang'd I say when he saw this he stood like one astonish'd and amaz'd However with a little Use I made all these Things familiar to him and he became an expert Sailor except that as to the Compass I could make him understand very little of that On the other hand as there was very little cloudy Weather and seldom or never any Fogs in those Parts there was the less occasion for a Compass seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night and the Shore by Day except in the rainy Seasons and then no body car'd to stir abroad either by Land or Sea  I was now entred on the seven and twentieth Year of my Captivity in this Place though the three last Years that I had this Creature with me ought rather to be left out of the Account my Habitation  being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the Time I kept the Anniversary of my Landing here with the same Thankfulness to God for his Mercies as at first and if I had such Cause of Acknowledgment at first I had much more so now having such additional Testimonies of the Care of Providence over me and the great Hopes I had of being effectually and speedily deliver'd for I had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts that my Deliverance was at hand and that I should not be another Year in this Place However I went on with my Husbandry digging planting fencing as usual I gather'd and cur'd my Grapes and did every necessary Thing as before  The rainy Season was in the mean Time upon me when I kept more within Doors than at other Times so I had stow'd our new Vessel as secure as we could bringing her up into the Creek where as I said in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from the Ship and haling her up to the Shore at high Water mark I made my Man  Friday  dig a little Dock just big enough to hold her and just deep enough to give her Water enough to fleet in and then when the Tide was out we made a strong Dam cross the End of it to keep the Water out and so she lay dry as to the Tide from the Sea and to keep the Rain off we laid a great many Boughs of Trees so thick that she was as well thatch'd as a House and thus we waited for the Month of  November  and  December  in which I design'd to make my Adventure  When the settled Season began to come in as the thought of my Design return'd with the fair Weather I was preparing daily for the Voyage and the first Thing I did was to lay by a certain Quantity of Provisions being the Stores for our Voyage and intended in a Week or a Fortnight's  Time to open the Dock and launch out our Boat I was busy one Morning upon some Thing of this kind when I call'd to  Friday  and bid him go to the Sea Shore and see if he could find a Turtle or Tortoise a Thing which we generally got once a Week for the Sake of the Eggs as well as the Flesh  Friday  had not been long gone when he came running back and flew over my outer Wall or Fence like one that felt not the Ground or the Steps he set his Feet on and before I had time to speak to him he cries out to me  O Master O Master O Sorrow O bad  What's the Matter  Friday  says I  O yonder there  says he  one two three Canoe one two three  By his way of speaking I concluded there were six but on enquiry I found it was but three Well  Friday  says I do not be frighted so I heartned him up as well as I could However I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scar'd for nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to look for him and would cut him in Pieces and eat him and the poor Fellow trembled so that I scarce knew what to do with him I comforted him as well as I could and told him I was in as much Danger as he and that they would eat me as well as him  but  says I  Friday we must resolve to fight them Can you fight  Friday  Me shoot  says he  but there come many great Number  No matter for that said I again our Guns will fright them that we do not kill so I ask'd him Whether if I resolv'd to defend him he would defend me and stand by me and do just as I bid him He said  Me die when you bid die Master  so I went and fetch'd a good Dram of Rum and gave him for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum that I had a great deal left When he had drank it I made him take the two FowlingPieces which we always carry'd and load them with large SwanShot as big as small Pistol  Bullets then I took four Muskets and loaded them with two Slugs and five small Bullets each and my two Pistols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets each I hung my great Sword as usual naked by my Side and gave  Friday  his Hatchet  When I had thus prepar'd my self I took my PerspectiveGlass and went up to the Side of the Hill to see what I could discover and I found quickly by my Glass that there were one and twenty Savages three Prisoners and three  Canoes  and that their whole Business seem'd to be the triumphant Banquet upon these three humane Bodies a barbarous Feast indeed but nothing else more than as I had observ'd was usual with them  I observ'd also that they were landed not where they had done when  Friday  made his Escape but nearer to my Creek where the Shore was low and where a thick Wood came close almost down to the Sea This with the Abhorrence of the inhumane Errand these Wretches came about fill'd me with such Indignation that I came down again to  Friday  and told him I was resolv'd to go down to them and kill them all and ask'd him If he would stand by me He was now gotten over his Fright and his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had given him he was very chearful and told me as before  he would die when I bid die    In this Fit of Fury I took first and divided the Arms which I had charg'd as before between us I gave  Friday  one Pistol to stick in his Girdle and three Guns upon his Shoulder and I took one Pistol and the other three my self and in this Posture we march'd out I took a small Bottle of Rum in my Pocket and gave  Friday  a large Bag with more Powder and Bullet and as to Orders I charg'd him to keep close behind me and not to stir or shoot or do any Thing till I bid him and  in the mean Time not to speak a Word In this Posture I fetch'd a Compass to my RightHand of near a Mile as well to get over the Creek as to get into the Wood so that I might come within shoot of them before I should be discover'd which I had seen by my Glass it was easy to do  While I was making this March my former Thoughts returning I began to abate my Resolution I do not mean that I entertain'd any Fear of their Number for as they were naked unarm'd Wretches 'tis certain I was superior to them nay though I had been alone but it occurr'd to my Thoughts What Call What Occasion much less What Necessity I was in to go and dip my Hands in Blood to attack People who had neither done or intended me any Wrong Who as to me were innocent and whose barbarous Customs were their own Disaster being in them a Token indeed of God's having left them with the other Nations of that Part of the World to such Stupidity and to such inhumane Courses but did not call me to take upon me to be a Judge of their Actions much less an Executioner of his Justice that whenever he thought fit he would take the Cause into his own Hands and by national Vengeance punish them as a People for national Crimes but that in the mean time it was none of my Business that it was true  Friday  might justify it because he was a declar'd Enemy and in a State of War with those very particular People and it was lawful for him to attack them but I could not say the same with respect to me These Things were so warmly press'd upon my Thoughts all the way as I went that I resolv'd I would only go and place my self near them that I might observe their barbarous Feast and that I would act then as God should direct but that unless something offer'd that was  more a Call to me than yet I knew of I would not meddle with them  With this Resolution I enter'd the Wood and with all possible Waryness and Silence  Friday  following close at my Heels I march'd till I came to the Skirt of the Wood on the Side which was next to them only that one Corner of the Wood lay between me and them here I call'd softly to  Friday  and shewing him a great Tree which was just at the Corner of the Wood I bad him go to the Tree and bring me Word if he could see ther  plainly what they were doing he did so and came immediately back to me and told me they might be plainly view'd there that they were all about their Fire eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners and that another lay bound upon the Sand a little from them which he said they would kill next and which fir'd all the very Soul within me he told me it was not one of their Nation but one of the bearded Men who he had told me of that came to their Country in the Boat I was fill'd with Horror at the very naming the whitebearded Man and going to the Tree I saw plainly by my Glass a white Man who lay upon the Beach of the Sea with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with Flags or Things like Rushes and that he was an  European  and had Cloaths on  There was another Tree and a little Thicket beyond it about fifty Yards nearer to them than the Place where I was which by going a little way about I saw I might come at undiscover'd and that then I should be within half Shot of them so I withheld my Passion though I was indeed enrag'd to the highest Degree and going back about twenty Paces I got behind some Bushes which held all the way till I came to the other Tree and then I came to a little rising Ground which gave me a  full View of them at the Distance of about eighty Yards  I had now not a Moment to loose for nineteen of the dreadful Wretches sat upon the Ground all close huddled together and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor  Christian  and bring him perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire and they were stoop'd down to untie the Bands at his Feet I turn'd to  Friday  now  Friday  said I do as I bad thee  Friday  said he would then  Friday  says I do exactly as you see me do fail in nothing so I set down one of the Muskets and the FowlingPiece upon the Ground and  Friday  did the like by his and with the other Musket I took my aim at the Savages bidding him do the like then asking him If he was ready He said yes then fire at them said I and the same Moment I fir'd also  Friday  took his Aim so much better than I that on the Side that he shot he kill'd two of them and wounded three more and on my Side I kill'd one and wounded two They were you may be sure in a dreadful Consternation and all of them who were not hurt jump'd up upon their Feet but did not immediately know which way to run or which way to look for they knew not from whence their Destruction came  Friday  kept his Eyes close upon me that as I had bid him he might observe what I did so as soon as the first Shot was made I threw down the Piece and took up the FowlingPiece and  Friday  did the like he see me cock and present he did the same again Are you ready  Friday  said I yes says he let fly then says I in the Name of God and with that I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches and so did  Friday  and as our Pieces were now loaden with what I call'd SwanShot or small Pistol Bullets  we found only two drop but so many were wounded that they run about yelling and skreaming like mad Creatures all bloody and miserably wounded most of them whereof three more fell quickly after though not quite dead  Now  Friday  says I laying down the discharg'd Pieces and taking up the Musket which was yet loaden follow me says I which he did with a great deal of Courage upon which I rush'd out of the Wood and shew'd my self and  Friday  close at my Foot as soon as I perceiv'd they saw me I shouted as loud as I could and bad  Friday  do so too and running as fast as I could  which by the way was not very fast being loaden with Arms as I was  I made directly towards the poor Victim who was as I said lying upon the Beach or Shore between the Place where they sat and the Sea the two Butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at the Suprize of our first Fire and fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea Side and had jump'd into a  Canoe  and three more of the rest made the same way I turn'd to  Friday  and bid him step forwards and fire at them he understood me immediately and running about forty Yards to be near them he shot at them and I thought he had kill'd them all for I see them all fall of a Heap into the Boat though I saw two of them up again quickly However he kill'd two of them and wounded the third so that he lay down in the Bottom of the Boat as if he had been dead  While my Man  Friday  fir'd at them I pull'd out my Knife and cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim and loosing his Hands and Feets I lifted him up and ask'd him in the  Portuguese  Tongue What he was He answer'd in Latin  Christianus  but was so weak and faint that he could scarce  stand or speak I took my Bottle out of my Pocket and gave it him making Signs that he should drink which he did and I gave him a Piece of Bread which he eat then I ask'd him What Countryman he was And he said  Espagniole  and being a little recover'd let me know by all the Signs he could possibly make how much he was in my Debt for his Deliverance  Seignior  said I with as much  Spanish  as I could make up we will talk afterwards but we must fight now if you have any Strength left take this Pistol and Sword and lay about you he took them very thankfully and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands but as if they had put new Vigour into him he flew upon his Murtherers like a Fury and had cut two of them in Pieces in an instant for the Truth is as the whole was a Surprize to them so the poor Creatures were so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces that they fell down for meer Amazement and Fear and had no more Power to attempt their own Escape than their Flesh had to resist our Shot and that was the Case of those Five that  Friday  shot at in the Boat for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd so the other two fell with the Fright  I kept my Piece in my Hand still without firing being willing to keep my Charge ready because I had given the  Spaniard  my Pistol and Sword so I call'd to  Friday  and bad him run up to the Tree from whence we first fir'd and fetch the Arms which lay there that had been discharg'd which he did with great Swiftness and then giving him my Musket I sat down my self to load all the rest again and bad them come to me when they wanted While I was loading these Pieces there happen'd a fierce Engagement between the  Spaniard  and one of the Savages who made at him with one of  their great wooden Swords the same Weapon that was to have kill'd him before if I had not prevented it The  Spaniard  who was as bold and as brave as could be imagin'd though weak had fought this  Indian  a good while and had cut him two great Wounds on his Head but the Savage being a stout lusty Fellow closing in with him had thrown him down being faint and was wringing my Sword out of his Hand when the  Spaniard  tho' undermost wisely quitting the Sword drew the Pistol from his Girdle shot the Savage through the Body and kill'd him upon the Spot before I who was running to help him could come near him  Friday  being now left to his Liberty pursu'd the flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand but his Hatchet and with that he dispatch'd those three who as I said before were wounded at first and fallen and all the rest he could come up with and the  Spaniard  coming to me for a Gun I gave him one of the FowlingPieces with which he pursu'd two of the Savages and wounded them both but as he was not able to run they both got from him into the Wood where  Friday  pursu'd them and kill'd one of them but the other was too nimble for him and though he was wounded yet had plunged himself into the Sea and swam with all his might off to those two who were left in the  Canoe  which three in the  Canoe  with one wounded who we know not whether he dy'd or no were all that escap'd our Hands of one and twenty The Account of the Rest is as follows  Kill'd at our first Shot from the Tree  Kill'd at the next Shot  Kill'd by  Friday  in the Boat  Kill'd by  Ditto  of those at first wounded  Kill'd by  Ditto  in the Wood  Kill'd by the  Spaniard    Kill'd being found dropp'd here and there of their Wounds or kill'd by  Friday  in his Chase of them  Escap'd in the Boat whereof one wounded if not dead  In all  Those that were in the  Canoe  work'd hard to get out of GunShot and though  Friday  made two or three Shot at them I did not find that he hit any of them  Friday  would fain have had me took one of their  Canoes  and pursu'd them and indeed I was very anxious about their Escape least carrying the News home to their People they should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their  Canoes  and devour us by meer Multitude so I consented to pursue them by Sea and running to one of their  Canoes  I jump'd in and bad  Friday  follow me but when I was in the  Canoe  I was surpriz'd to find another poor Creature lye there alive bound Hand and Foot as the  Spaniard  was for the Slaughter and almost dead with Fear not knowing what the Matter was for he had not been able to look up over the Side of the Boat he was ty'd so hard Neck and Heels and had been ty'd so long that he had really but little Life in him  I immediately cut the twisted Flags or Rushes which they had bound him with and would have helped him up but he could not stand or speak but groan'd most piteously believing it seems still that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd  When  Friday  came to him I bad him speak to him and tell him of his Deliverance and pulling out my Bottle made him give the poor Wretch a  Dram which with the News of his being deliver'd reviv'd him and he sat up in the Boat but when  Friday  came to hear him speak and look in his Face it would have mov'd any one to Tears to have seen how  Friday  kiss'd him embrac'd him hugg'd him cry'd laugh'd hollow'd jump'd about danc'd sung then cry'd again wrung his Hands beat his own Face and Head and then sung and jump'd about again like a distracted Creature It was a good while before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the Matter but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his Father  It is not easy for me to express how it mov'd me to see what Extasy and filial Affection had work'd in this poor  Savage  at the Sight of his Father and of his being deliver'd from Death nor indeed can I describe half the Extravagancies of his Affection after this for he went into the Boat and out of the Boat a great many times When he went in to him he would sit down by him open his Breast and hold his Father's Head close to his Bosom half an Hour together to nourish it then he took his Arms and Ankles which were numb'd and stiff with the Binding and chaffed and rubbed them with his Hands and I perceiving what the Case was gave him some Rum out of my Bottle to rub them with which did them a great deal of Good  This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe with the other  Savages  who were now gotten almost out of Sight and it was happy for us that we did not for it blew so hard within two Hours after and before they could be gotten a Quarter of their Way and continued blowing so hard all Night and that from the  Northwest  which was against them that I could not suppose  their Boat could live or that they ever reach'd to their own Coast  But to return to  Friday  he was so busy about his Father that I could not find in my Heart to take him off for some time But after I thought he could leave him a little I call'd him to me and he came jumping and laughing and pleas'd to the highest Extream then I ask'd him If he had given his Father any Bread He shook his Head and said  None Ugly Dog eat all up self  so I gave him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry'd on Purpose I also gave him a Dram for himself but he would not taste it but carry'd it to his Father I had in my Pocket also two or three Bunches of my Raisins so I gave him a Handful of them for his Father He had no sooner given his Father these Raisins but I saw him come out of the Boat and run away as if he had been bewitch'd he run at such a Rate for he was the swiftest Fellow of his Foot that ever I saw I say he run at such a Rate that he was out of Sight as it were in an instant and though I call'd and hollow'd too after him it was all one away he went and in a Quarter of an Hour I saw him come back again though not so fast as he went and as he came nearer I found his Pace was slacker because he had something in his Hand  When he came up to me I found he had been quite Home for an Earthen Jugg or Pot to bring his Father some fresh Water and that he had got two more Cakes or Loaves of Bread The Bread he gave me but the Water he carry'd to his Father However as I was very thirsty too I took a little Sup of it This Water reviv'd his Father more than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him for he was just fainting with Thirst  When his Father had drank I call'd to him to know if there was any Water left he said yes and I bad him give it to the poor  Spaniard  who was in as much Want of it as his Father and I sent one of the Cakes that  Friday  brought to the  Spaniard  too who was indeed very weak and was reposing himself upon a green Place under the Shade of a Tree and whose Limbs were also very stiff and very much swell'd with the rude Bandage he had been ty'd with When I saw that upon  Friday  's coming to him with the Water he sat up and drank and took the Bread and began to eat I went to him and gave him a Handful of Raisins he look'd up in my Face with all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness that could appear in any Countenance but was so weak notwithstanding he had so exerted himsef in the Fight that he could not stand up upon his Feet he try'd to do it two or three times but was really not able his Ankles were so swell'd and so painful to him so I bad him sit still and caused  Friday  to rub his Ankles and bathe them with Rum as he had done his Father's  I observ'd the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes or perhaps less all the while he was here turn'd his Head about to see if his Father was in the same Place and Posture as he left him sitting and at last he found he was not to be seen at which he started up and without speaking a Word flew with that Swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch the Ground as he went But when he came he only found he had laid himself down to ease his Limbs so  Friday  came back to me presently and I then spoke to the  Spaniard  to let  Friday  help him up if he could and lead him to the Boat and then he should carry him to our Dwelling where  I would take Care of him But  Friday  a lusty strong Fellow took the  Sqaniard  quite up upon his Back and carry'd him away to the Boat and set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of the Canoe with his Feet in the inside of it and then lifted him quite in and set him close to his Father and presently stepping out again launched the Boat off and paddled it along the Shore faster than I could walk tho' the Wind blew pretty hard too so he brought them both safe into our Creek and leaving them in the Boat runs away to fetch the other Canoe As he pass'd me I spoke to him and ask'd him whither he went he told me  Go fetch more Boat  so away he went like the Wind for sure never Man or Horse run like him and he had the other Canoe in the Creek almost as soon as I got to it by Land so he wafted me over and then went to help our new Guests out of the Boat which he did but they were neither of them able to walk so that poor  Friday  knew not what to do  To remedy this I went to Work in my Thought and calling to  Friday  to bid them sit down on the Bank while he came to me I soon made a Kind of HandBarrow to lay them on and  Friday  and I carry'd them up both together upon it between us But when we got them to the outside of our Wall or Fortification we were at a worse Loss than before for it was impossible to get them over and I was resolv'd not to break it down So I set to Work again and  Friday  and I in about Hours time made a very handsom Tent cover'd with old Sails and above that with Boughs of Trees being in the Space without our outward Fence and between that and the Grove of young Wood which I had planted And here we made them two Beds of such things as I had  viz  of good RiceStraw  with Blankets laid upon it to lye on and another to cover them on each Bed  My Island was now peopled and I thought my self very rich in Subjects and it was a merry Reflection which I frequently made How like a King I look'd First of all the whole Country was my own meer Property so that I had an undoubted Right of Dominion  dly  My People were perfectly subjected I was absolute Lord and Lawgiver they all owed their Lives to me and were ready to lay down their Lives  if there had been Occasion of it  for me It was remarkable too we had but three Subjects and they were of three different Religions My Man  Friday  was a Protestant his Father was a  Pagan  and a  Cannibal  and the  Spaniard  was a Papist However I allow'd Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions But this is by the Way  As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued Prisoners and given them Shelter and a Place to rest them upon I began to think of making some Provision for them And the first thing I did I order'd  Friday  to take a yearling Goat betwixt a Kid and a Goat out of my particular Flock to be kill'd when I cut off the hinder Quarter and chopping it into small Pieces I set  Friday  to Work to boiling and stewing and made them a very good Dish I assure you of Flesh and Broth having put some Barley and Rice also into the Broth and as I cook'd it without Doors for I made no Fire within my inner Wall so I carry'd it all into the new Tent and having set a Table there for them I sat down and eat my own Dinner also with them and as well as I could chear'd them and encourag'd them  Friday  being my Interpreter especially to his Father and indeed to the  Spaniard  too for the  Spaniard  spoke the Language of the  Savages  pretty well  After we had dined or rather supped I order'd  Friday  to take one of the Canoes and go and fetch our Muskets and other FireArms which for Want of time we had left upon the Place of Battle and the next Day I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of the Savages which lay open to the Sun and would presently be offensive and I also order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feast which I knew were pretty much and which I could not think of doing my self nay I could not bear to see them if I went that Way All which he punctually performed and defaced the very Appearance of the  Savages  being there so that when I went again I could scarce know where it was otherwise than by the Corner of the Wood pointing to the Place  I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new Subjects and first I set  Friday  to enquire of his Father what he thought of the Escape of the  Savages  in that Canoe and whether we might expect a Return of them with a Power too great for us to resist His first Opinion was that the Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm which blew that Night they went off but must of Necessity be drowned or driven  South  to those other Shores where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away but as to what they would do if they came safe on Shore he said he knew not but it was his Opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the Manner of their being attack'd the Noise and the Fire that he believed they would tell their People they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning not by the Hand of Man and that the two which appear'd  viz Friday  and me were two Heavenly  Spirits or Furies come down to destroy them and not Men with Weapons This he said he knew because he heard them all cry out so in their Language to one another for it was impossible to them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire and speak Thunder and kill at a Distance without lifting up the Hand as was done now And this old Savage was in the right for as I understood since by other Hands the Savages never attempted to go over to the Island afterwards they were so terrified with the Accounts given by those four Men for it seems they did escape the Sea that they believ'd whoever went to that enchanted Island would be destroy'd with Fire from the Gods  This however I knew not and therefore was under continual Apprehensions for a good while and kept always upon my Guard me and all my Army for as we were now four of us I would have ventur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any Time  In a little Time however no more Canoes appearing the Fear of their Coming wore off and I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage to the Main into Consideration being likewise assur'd by  Friday  's Father that I might depend upon good Usage from their Nation on his Account if I would go  But my Thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious Discourse with the  Spaniard  and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his Countrymen and  Portuguese  which is near that Number who having been cast away and made their Escape to that Side liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Savages but were very sore put to it for Necessaries and indeed for Life I ask'd him all the Particulars of their Voyage and found they were a  Spanish  Ship bound from the  Rio de la Plata  to the  Havana  being directed to leave their Loading there which was chiefly Hides and Silver and to bring back what  European  Goods they could meet with there that they had five  Portuguese  Seamen on Board who they took out of another Wreck that five of their own Men were drowned when the first Ship was lost and that these escaped thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards and arriv'd almost starv'd on the  Cannibal  Coast where they expected to have been devour'd every Moment  He told me they had some Arms with them but they were perfectly useless for that they had neither Powder or Ball the Washing of the Sea having spoil'd all their Powder but a little which they used at their first Landing to provide themselves some Food  I ask'd him what he thought would become of them there and if they had form'd no Design of making any Escape He said They had many Consultations about it but that having neither Vessel or Tools to build one or Provisions of any kind their Councils always ended in Tears and Despair  I ask'd him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from me which might tend towards an Escape And whether if they were all here it might not be done I told him with Freedom I fear'd mostly their Treachery and ill Usage of me if I put my Life in their Hands for that Gratitude was no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man nor did Men always square their Dealings by the Obligations they had receiv'd so much as they did by the Advantages they expected I told him it would be very hard that I should be the Instrument of their Deliverance and that they should afterwards make me their Prisoner in  New Spain  where an  English  Man was certain to be made a Sacrifice  what Necessity or what Accident soever brought him thither And that I had rather be deliver'd up to the  Savages  and be devour'd alive than fall into the merciless Claws of the Priests and be carry'd into the  Inquisition  I added That otherwise I was perswaded if they were all here we might with so many Hands build a Bark large enough to carry us all away either to the  Brasils  Southward or to the Islands or  Spanish  Coast Northward But that if in Requital they should when I had put Weapons into their Hands carry me by Force among their own People I might be ill used for my Kindness to them and make my Case worse than it was before  He answer'd with a great deal of Candor and Ingenuity That their Condition was so miserable and they were so sensible of it that he believed they would abhor the Thought of using any Man unkindly that should contribute to their Deliverance and that if I pleased he would go to them with the old Man and discourse with them about it and return again and bring me their Answer That he would make Conditions with them upon their solemn Oath That they should be absolutely under my Leading as their Commander and Captain and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the Gospel to be true to me and to go to such Christian Country as that I should agree to and no other and to be directed wholly and absolutely to my Orders 'till they were landed safely in such Country as I intended and that he would bring a Contract from them under their Hands for that Purpose  Then he told me he would first swear to me himself That he would never stir from me as long as he liv'd 'till I gave him Orders and that he would take my Side to the last Drop of his Blood  if there should happen the least Breach of Faith among his Countrymen  He told me they were all of them very civil honest Men and they were under the greatest Distress imaginable having neither Weapons or Cloaths nor any Food but at the Mercy and Discretion of the  Savages  out of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country and that he was sure if I would undertake their Relief they would live and die by me  Upon these Assurances I resolv'd to venture to relieve them if possible and to send the old  Savage  and this  Spaniard  over to them to treat But when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go the  Spaniard  himself started an Objection which had so much Prudence in it on one hand and so much Sincerity on the other hand that I could not but be very well satisfy'd in it and by his Advice put off the Deliverance of his Comerades for at least half a Year The Case was thus  He had been with us now about a Month during which time I had let him see in what Manner I had provided with the Assistance of Providence for my Support and he saw evidently what Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up which as it was more than sufficient for my self so it was not sufficient at least without good Husbandry for my Family now it was encreas'd to Number four But much less would it be sufficient if his Countrymen who were as he said fourteen still alive should come over And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our Vessel if we should build one for a Voyage to any of the Christian Colonies of  America  So he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the two other dig and cultivate some more Land as much as I could spare Seed to sow and that we  should wait another Harvest that we might have a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen when they should come for Want might be a Temptation to them to disagree or not to think themselves delivered otherwise than out of one Difficulty into another You know says he the Children of  Israel  though they rejoyc'd at first for their being deliver'd out of  Egypt  yet rebell'd even against God himself that deliver'd them when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness  His Caution was so seasonable and his Advice so good that I could not but be very well pleased with his Proposal as well as I was satisfy'd with his Fidelity So we fell to digging all four of us as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with permitted and in about a Month's time by the End of which it was Seed time we had gotten as much Land cur'd and trim'd up as we sowed Bushels of Barley on and Jarrs of Rice which was in short all the Seed we had to spare nor indeed did we leave our selves Barley sufficient for our own Food for the six Months that we had to expect our Crop that is to say reckoning from the time we set our Seed aside for sowing for it is not to be supposed it is six Months in the Ground in the Country  Having now Society enough and our Number being sufficient to put us out of Fear of the  Savages  if they had come unless their Number had been very great we went freely all over the Island whereever we found Occasion and as here we had our Escape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts it was impossible  at least for me  to have the Means of it out of mine to this Purpose I mark'd out several Trees which I thought fit for our Work and I set  Friday  and his Father to cutting them down and then I caused the  Spaniard    to whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair to oversee and direct their Work I shewed them with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large Tree into single Planks and I caused them to do the like till they had made about a Dozen large Planks of good Oak near Foot broad Foot long and from Inches to Inches thick What prodigious Labour it took up any one may imagine  At the same time I contriv'd to encrease my little Flock of tame Goats as much as I could and to this Purpose I made  Friday  and the  Spaniard  go out one Day and my self with  Friday  the next Day for we took our Turns And by this Means we got above young Kids to breed up with the rest for whenever we shot the Dam we saved the Kids and added them to our Flock But above all the Season for curing the Grapes coming on I caused such a prodigious Quantity to be hung up in the Sun that I believe had we been at  Alicant  where the Raisins of the Sun are cur'd we could have fill'd or Barrels and these with our Bread was a great Part of our Food and very good living too I assure you for it is an exceeding nourishing Food  It was now Harvest and our Crop in good Order it was not the most plentiful Encrease I had seen in the Island but however it was enough to answer our End for from our Bushels of Barley we brought in and thrashed out above Bushels and the like in Proportion of the Rice which was Store enough for our Food to the next Harvest tho' all the  Spaniards  had been on Shore with me or if we had been ready for a Voyage it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship to have carry'd us to any Part of the World that is to say of  America    When we had thus hous'd and secur'd our Magazine of Corn we fell to Work to make more Wicker Work  viz  great Baskets in which we kept it and the  Spaniard  was very handy and dexterous at this Part and often blam'd me that I did not make some things for Defence of this Kind of Work but I saw no Need of it  And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I expected I gave the  Spaniard  Leave to go over to the  Main  to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there I gave him a strict Charge in Writing Not to bring any Man with him who would not first swear in the Presence of himself and of the old  Savage  That he would no way injure fight with or attack the Person he should find in the Island who was so kind to send for them in order to their Deliverance but that they would stand by and defend him against all such Attempts and whereever they went would be entirely under and subjected to his Commands and that this should be put in Writing and signed with their Hands How we were to have this done when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink that indeed was a Question which we never asked  Under these Instructions the  Spaniard  and the old  Savage  the Father of  Friday  went away in one of the Canoes which they might be said to come in or rather were brought in when they came as Prisoners to be devour'd by the  Savages    I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it and about eight Charges of Powder and Ball charging them to be very good Husbands of both and not to use either of them but upon urgent Occasion  This was a chearful Work being the first Measures used by me in View of my Deliverance for  now Years and some Days I gave them Provisions of Bread and of dry'd Grapes sufficient for themselves for many Days and sufficient for all their Countrymen for about eight Days time and wishing them a good Voyage I see them go agreeing with them about a Signal they should hang out at their Return by which I should know them again when they came back at a Distance before they came on Shore  They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at Full by my Account in the Month of  October  But as for an exact Reckoning of Days after I had once lost it I could never recover it again nor had I kept even the Number of Years so punctually as to be sure that I was right tho' as it prov'd when I afterwards examin'd my Account I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years  It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them when a strange and unforeseen Accident interveen'd of which the like has not perhaps been heard of in History I was fast asleep in my Hutch one Morning when my Man  Friday  came running in to me and call'd aloud Master Master they are come they are come  I jump'd up and regardless of Danger I went out as soon as I could get my Cloaths on thro' my little Grove which by the Way was by this time grown to be a very thick Wood I say regardless of Danger I went without my Arms which was not my Custom to do But I was surpriz'd when turning my Eyes to the Sea I presently saw a Boat at about a League and half's Distance standing in for the Shore with a  Shoulder of Mutton Sail  as they call it and the Wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in also I observ'd presently that they did not come from that Side which the Shore lay on but from the Southermost  End of the Island Upon this I call'd  Friday  in and bid him lie close for these were not the People we look'd for and that we might not know yet whether they were Friends or Enemies  In the next Place I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass to see what I could make of them and having taken the Ladder out I climb'd up to the Top of the Hill as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing and to take my View the plainer without being discover'd  I had scarce set my Foot on the Hill when my Eye plainly discover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor at about two Leagues and an half's Distance from me Southsoutheast but not above a League and an half from the Shore By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an  English  Ship and the Boat appear'd to be an  English  LongBoat  I cannot express the Confusion I was in tho' the Joy of seeing a Ship and one who I had Reason to believe was Mann'd by my own Countrymen and consequently Friends was such as I cannot describe but yet I had some secret Doubts hung about me I cannot tell from whence they came bidding me keep upon my Guard In the first Place it occurr'd to me to consider what Business an  English  Ship could have in that Part of the World since it was not the Way to or from any Part of the World where the  English  had any Traffick and I knew there had been no Storms to drive them in there as in Distress and that if they were  English  really it was most probable that they were here upon no good Design and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Murtherers  Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no Possibility of its being  real That such Hints and Notices are given us I believe few that have made any Observations of things can deny that they are certain Discoveries of an invisible World and a Converse of Spirits we cannot doubt and if the Tendency of them seems to be to warn us of Danger why should we not suppose they are from some friendly Agent whether supreme or inferior and subordinate is not the Question and that they are given for our Good  The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of this Reasoning for had I not been made cautious by this secret Admonition come it from whence it will I had been undone inevitably and in a far worse Condition than before as you will see presently  I had not kept my self long in this Posture but I saw the Boat draw near the Shore as if they look'd for a Creek to thrust in at for the Convenience of Landing however as they did not come quite far enough they did not see the little Inlet where I formerly landed my Rafts but run their Boat on Shore upon the Beach at about half a Mile from me which was very happy for me for otherwise they would have landed just as I may say at my Door and would soon have beaten me out of my Castle and perhaps have plunder'd me of all I had  When they were on Shore I was fully satisfy'd that they were  English  Men at least most of them one or two I thought were  Dutch  but it did not prove so There were in all eleven Men whereof three of them I found were unarm'd and as I thought bound and when the first four or five of them were jump'd on Shore they took those three out of the Boat as Prisoners One of the three I could perceive using the most passionate Gestures of  Entreaty Affliction and Despair even to a kind of Extravagance the other two I could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes and appear'd concern'd indeed but not to such a Degree as the first  I was perfectly confounded at the Sight and knew not what the Meaning of it should be  Friday  call'd out to me in  English  as well as he could  O  Master  You see  English  Mans eat Prisoner as well as  Savage  Mans  Why says I  Friday Do you think they are a going to eat them then Yes  says Friday  They will eat them No no  says I Friday  I am afraid they will murther them indeed but you may be sure they will not eat them    All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was but stood trembling with the Horror of the Sight expecting every Moment when the three Prisoners should be kill'd nay once I saw one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cutlash as the Seamen call it or Sword to strike one of the poor Men and I expected to see him fall every Moment at which all the Blood in my Body seem'd to run chill in my Veins  I wish'd heartily now for my  Spaniard  and the  Savage  that was gone with him or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd within shot of them that I might have rescu'd the three Men for I saw no Fire Arms they had among them but it fell out to my Mind another way  After I had observ'd the outragious Usage of the three Men by the insolent Seamen I observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the Land as if they wanted to see the Country I observ'd that the three other Men had Liberty to go also where they pleas'd but they sat down all three upon the Ground very pensive and look'd like Men in Despair  This put me in Mind of the first Time when I came on Shore and began to look about me How I gave my self over for lost How wildly I look'd round me What dreadful Apprehensions I had And how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear of being devour'd by wild Beasts  As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive by the providential Driving of the Ship nearer the Land by the Storms and Tide by which I have since been so long nourish'd and supported so these three poor desolate Men knew nothing how certain of Deliverance and Supply they were how near it was to them and how effectually and really they were in a Condition of Safety at the same Time that they thought themselves lost and their Case desperate  So little do we see before us in the World and so much reason have we to depend chearfully upon the great Maker of the World that he does not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute but that in the worst Circumstances they have always something to be thankful for and sometimes are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine nay are even brought to their Deliverance by the Means by which they seem to be brought to their Destruction  It was just at the Top of HighWater when these People came on Shore and while partly they stood parlying with the Prisoners they brought and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a Place they were in they had carelesly staid till the Tide was spent and the Water was ebb'd considerably away leaving their Boat aground  They had left two Men in the Boat who as I found afterwards having drank a little too much Brandy fell asleep however one of them waking sooner than the other and finding the Boat too fast  aground for him to stir it hollow'd for the rest who were straggling about upon which they all soon came to the Boat but it was past all their Strength to launch her the Boat being very heavy and the Shore on that Side being a soft ousy Sand almost like a QuickSand  In this Condition like true Seamen who are perhaps the least of all Mankind given to forethought they gave it over and away they stroll'd about the Country again and I heard one of them say aloud to another calling them off from the Boat  Why let her alone  Jack  can't ye she will float next Tide  by which I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry of what Countrymen they were  All this while I kept my self very close not once daring to stir out of my Castle any farther than to my Place of Observation near the Top of the Hill and very glad I was to think how well it was fortify'd I knew it was no less than ten Hours before the Boat could be on float again and by that Time it would be dark and I might be at more Liberty to see theit Motions and to hear their Discourse if they had any  In the mean Time I fitted my self up for a Battle as before though with more Caution knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had at first I order'd  Friday  also who I had made an excellent MarksMan with his Gun to load himself with Arms I took my self two FowlingPieces and I gave him three Muskets my Figure indeed was very fierce I had my formidable GoatSkin Coat on with the great Cap I have mention'd a naked Sword by my Side two Pistols in my Belt and a Gun upon each Shoulder  It was my Design as I said above not to have made any Attempt till it was Dark But about Two a Clock being the Heat of the Day I found  that in short they were all gone straggling into the Woods and as I thought were laid down to Sleep The three poor distressed Men too Anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep were however set down under the Shelter of a great Tree at about a quarter of a Mile from me and as I thought out of sight of any of the rest  Upon this I resolv'd to discover my self to them and learn something of their Condition Immediately I march'd in the Figure as above my Man  Friday  at a good Distance behind me as formidable for his Arms as I but not making quite so staring a  Spectrelike  Figure as I did  I came as near them undiscover'd as I could and then before any of them saw me I call'd aloud to them in  Spanish What are ye Gentlemen  They started up at the Noise but were ten times more confounded when they saw me and the uncouth Figure that I made They made no Answer at all but I thought I perceiv'd them just going to fly from me when I spoke to them in  English  Gentlemen said I do not be surpriz'd at me perhaps you may have a Friend near you when you did not expect it He must be sent directly from Heaven then  said one of them very gravely to me and pulling off his Hat at the same time to me  for our Condition is past the Help of Man All Help is from Heaven  Sir said I  But can you put a Stranger in the way how to help you for you seem to me to be in some great Distress I saw you when you landed and when you seem'd to make Applications to the Brutes that came with you I saw one of them lift up his Sword to kill you  The poor Man with Tears running down his Face and trembling looking like one astonish'd return'd  Am I talking to God or Man Is it a real  Man or an Angel  Be in no fear about that Sir  said I  if God had sent an Angel to relieve you he would have come better Cloath'd and Arm'd after another manner than you see me in pray lay aside your Fears I am a Man an  Englishman  and dispos'd to assist you you see I have one Servant only we have Arms and Ammunition tell us freely Can we serve you What is your Case  Our Case said he Sir is too long to tell you while our Murtherers are so near but in short Sir I was Commander of that Ship my Men have Mutinied against me they have been hardly prevail'd on not to Murther me and at last have set me on Shore in this desolate Place with these two Men with me one my Mate the other a Passenger where we expected to Perish believing the Place to be uninhabited and know not yet what to think of it  Where are those Brutes your Enemies said I do you know where they are gone  There they lye  Sir said he pointing to a Thicket of Trees  my Heart trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak if they have they will certainly Murther us all    Have they any FireArms  said I  He answered they had only two Pieces and one which they left in the Boat Well then said I leave the rest to me I see they are all asleep it is an easie thing to kill them all but shall we rather take them Prisoners He told me there were two desperate Villains among them that it was scarce safe to shew any Mercy to but if they were secur'd he believ'd all the rest would return to their Duty I ask'd him which they were He told me he could not at that distance describe them but he would obey my Orders in any thing  I would direct Well says I let us retreat out of their View or Hearing least they awake and we will resolve further so they willingly went back with me till the Woods cover'd us from them  Look you Sir said I if I venture upon your Deliverance are you willing to make two Conditions with me he anticipated my Proposals by telling me that both he and the Ship if recover'd should be wholly Directed and Commanded by me in every thing and if the Ship was not recover'd he would live and dye with me in what Part of the World soever I would send him and the two other Men said the same  Well  says I  my Conditions are but two  That while you stay on this Island with me you will not pretend to any Authority here and if I put Arms into your Hands you will upon all Occasions give them up to me and do no Prejudice to me or mine upon this Island and in the mean time be govern'd by my Orders  That if the Ship is or may be recover'd you will carry me and my Man to  England  Passage free  He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of Man could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable Demands and besides would owe his Life to me and acknowledge it upon all Occasions as long as he liv'd  Well then  said I  here are three Muskets for you with Powder and Ball tell me next what you think is proper to be done He shew'd all the Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able but offer'd to be wholly guided by me I told him I thought it was hard venturing any thing but the best Method I could think of was to fire upon them at once as they lay and if any was not kill'd at the first Volley and offered to submit  we might save them and so put it wholly upon God's Providence to direct the Shot  He said very modestly that he was loath to kill them if he could help it but that those two were incorrigible Villains and had been the Authors of all the Mutiny in the Ship and if they escaped we should be undone still for they would go on Board and bring the whole Ship's Company and destroy us all  Well then  says I  Necessity  legitimates my Advice for it is the only Way to save our Lives However seeing him still cautious of shedding Blood I told him they should go themselves and manage as they found convenient  In the Middle of this Discourse we heard some of them awake and soon after we saw two of them on their Feet I ask'd him if either of them were of the Men who he had said were the Heads of the Mutiny He said  No  Well then said I you may let them escape and Providence seems to have wakned them on Purpose to save themselves Now says I if the rest escape you  it is your Fault    Animated with this he took the Musket I had given him in his Hand and a Pistol in his Belt and his two Comerades with him with each Man a Piece in his Hand The two Men who were with him going first made some Noise at which one of the Seamen who was awake turn'd about and seeing them coming cry'd out to the rest but it was too late then for the Moment he cry'd out they fir'd  I mean the two Men  the Captain wisely reserving his own Piece They had so well aim'd their Shot at the Men they knew that one of them was kill'd on the Spot and the other very much wounded but not being dead he started up upon his Feet and call'd eagerly for  help to the other but the Captain stepping to him▪ told him 'twas too late to cry for help he should call upon God to forgive his Villany and with that Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his Musket so that he never spoke more There were three more in the Company and one of them was also slightly wounded By this Time I was come and when they saw their Danger and that it was in vain to resist they begg'd for Mercy The Captain told them he would spare their Lives if they would give him any Assurance of their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship and afterwards in carrying her back to  Jamaica  ▪ from whence they came They gave him all the Protestations of their Sincerity that could be desir'd and he was willing to believe them and spare their Lives which I was not against only that I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they were upon the Island  While this was doing I sent  Friday  with the Captain's Mate to the Boat with Orders to secure her and bring away the Oars and Sail which they did and by and by three straggling Men that were happily for them parted from the rest▪ came back upon hearing the Guns fir'd and seeing their Captain who before was their Prisoner now their Conqueror they submitted to be bound also and so our Victory was compleat  It now remain'd that the Captain and I should enquire into one another's Circumstances I began first and told him my whole History which he heard with an Attention even to Amazement and particularly at the wonderful Manner of my being furnish'd with Provisitions and Ammunition and indeed as my Story is a whole Collection of Wonders it affected him deeply but when he reflected  from thence upon himself and how I seem'd to have been preserv'd there on purpose to save his Life the Tears ran down his Face and he could not speak a Word more  After this Communication was at an End I carry'd him and his two Men into my Apartment leading them in just where I came out  viz  At the Top of the House where I refresh'd them with such Provisions as I had and shew'd them all the Contrivances I had made during my long long inhabiting that Place  All I shew'd them all I said to them was perfectly amazing but above all the Captain admir'd my Fortification and how perfectly I had conceal'd my Retreat with a Grove of Trees which having been now planted near twenty Years and the Trees growing much faster than in  England  was become a little Wood and so thick that it was unpassable in any Part of it but at that one Side where I had reserv'd my little winding Passage into it I told him this was my Castle and my Residence but that I had a Seat in the Country as most Princes have whither I could retreat upon Occasion and I would shew him that too another Time but at present our Business was to consider how to recover the Ship He agreed with me as to that but told me he was perfectly at a Loss what Measures to take for that there were still six and twenty Hands on board who having entred into a cursed Conspiracy by which they had all forfeited their Lives to the Law would be harden'd in it now by Desperation and would carry it on knowing that if they were reduc'd they should be brought to the Gallows as soon as they came to  England  or to any of the  English  Colonies and that therefore there would be no attacking them with so small a Number as we were  I mus'd for some Time upon what he had said and found it was a very rational Conclusion and that therefore something was to be resolv'd on very speedily as well to draw the Men on board into some Snare for their Surprize as to prevent their Landing upon us and destroying us upon this it presently occurr'd to me that in a little while the Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their Comrades and of the Boat would certainly come on Shore in their other Boat to see for them and that then perhaps they might come arm'd and be too strong for us this he allow'd was rational  Upon this I told him the first Thing we had to do was to stave the Boat which lay upon the Beach so that they might not carry her off and taking every Thing out of her leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim accordingly we went on board took the Arms which were left on board out of her and whatever else we found there which was a Bottle of Brandy and another of Rum a few Bisket Cakes a Horn of Powder and a great Lump of Sugar in a Piece of Canvas the Sugar was five or six Pounds all which was very welcome to me especially the Brandy and Sugar of which I had had none left for many Years  When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore the Oars Mast Sail and Rudder of the Boat were carry'd away before as above we knock'd a great Hole in her Bottom that if they had come strong enough to master us yet they could not carry off the Boat  Indeed it was not much in my Thoughts that we could be able to recover the Ship but my View was that if they went away without the Boat I did not much question to make her fit again to carry us away to the  Leeward  Islands and call upon our  Friends the  Spaniards  in my Way for I had them still in my Thoughts  While we were thus preparing our Designs and had first by main Strength heav'd the Boat up upon the Beach so high that the Tide would not fleet her off at HighWaterMark and besides had broke a Hole in her Bottom too big to be quickly stopp'd and were sat down musing what we should do we heard the Ship fire a Gun and saw her make a Waft with her Antient as a Signal for the Boat to come on board but no Boat stirr'd and they fir'd several Times making other Signals for the Boat  At last when all their Signals and Firings prov'd fruitless and they found the Boat did not stir we saw them by the Help of my Glasses hoist another Boat out and row towards the Shore and we found as they approach'd that there was no less than ten Men in her and that they had FireArms with them  As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore we had a full View of them as they came and a plain Sight of the Men even of their Faces because the Tide having set them a little to the  East  of the other Boat they row'd up under Shore to come to the same Place where the other had landed and where the Boat lay  By this Means I say we had a full View of them and the Captain knew the Persons and Characters of all the Men in the Boat of whom he said that there were three very honest Fellows who he was sure were led into this Conspiracy by the rest being overpower'd and frighted  But that as for the Boatswain who it seems was the chief Officer among them and all the rest they were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew and were no doubt made desperate in their new Enterprize  and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us  I smil'd at him and told him that Men in our Circumstances were past the Operation of Fear That seeing almost every Condition that could be was better than that which we were suppos'd to be in we ought to expect that the Consequence whether Death or Life would be sure to be a Deliverance I ask'd him What he thought of the Circumstances of my Life And Whether a Deliveance were not worth venturing for And where Sir said I is your Belief of my being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life which elevated you a little while ago For my Part said I there seems to be but one Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it  What's that  Says he why said I 'Tis that as you say there are three or four honest Fellows among them which should be spar'd had they been all of the wicked Part of the Crew I should have thought God's Providence had singled them out to deliver them into your Hands for depend upon it every Man of them that comes ashore are our own and shall die or live as they behave to us  As I spoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful Countenance I found it greatly encourag'd him so we set vigorously to our Business We had upon the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship consider'd of separating our Prisoners and had indeed secur'd them effectually  Two of them of whom the Captain was less assur'd than ordinary I sent with  Friday  and one of the three deliver'd Men to my Cave where they were remote enough and out of Danger of being heard or discover'd or of finding their way out of the Woods if they could have deliver'd themselves Here they left them bound but gave them Provisions and promis'd them if they continu'd there quietly  to give them their Liberty in a Day or two but that if they attempted their Escape they should be put to Death without Mercy They promis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience and were very thankful that they had such good Usage as to have Provisions and a Light left them for  Friday  gave them Candles such as we made our selves for their Comfort and they did not know but that he stood Sentinel over them at the Entrance  The other Prisoners had better Usage two of them were kept pinion'd indeed because the Captain was not free to trust them but the other two were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recommendation and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us so with them and the three honest Men we were seven Men well arm'd and I made no doubt we shou'd be able to deal well enough with the Ten that were a coming considering that the Captain had said there were three or four honest Men among them also  As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay they run their Boat in to the Beach and came all on Shore haling the Boat up after them which I was glad to see for I was afraid they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor some Distance from the Shore with some Hands in her to guard her and so we should not be able to seize the Boat  Being on Shore the first Thing they did they ran all to their other Boat and it was easy to see that they were under a great Surprize to find her stripp'd as above of all that was in her and a great hole in her Bottom  After they had mus'd a while upon this they set up two or three great Shouts hollowing with all their might to try if they could make their  Companions hear but all was to no purpese Then they came all close in a Ring and fir'd a Volley of their small Arms which indeed we heard and the Ecchos made the Woods ring but it was all one those in the Cave we were sure could not hear and those in our keeping though they heard it well enough yet durst give no Answer to them  They were so astonish'd at the Surprize of this that as they told us afterwards they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship and let them know that the Men were all murther'd and the LongBoat stav'd accordingly they immediately launch'd their Boat again and gat all of them on board  The Captain was terribly amaz'd and even confounded at this believing they would go on board the Ship again and set Sail giving their Comrades for lost and so he should still lose the Ship which he was in Hopes we should have recover'd but he was quickly as much frighted the other way  They had not been long put off with the Boat but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again but with this new Measure in their Conduct which it seems they consulted together upon  viz  To leave three Men in the Boat and the rest to go on Shore and go up into the Country to look for their Fellows  This was a great Disappointment to us for now we were at a Loss what to do for our seizing those seven Men on Shore would be no Advantage to us if we let the Boat escape because they would then row away to the Ship and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set Sail and so our recovering the Ship would be lost  However we had no Remedy but to wait and see what the Issue of Things might present the seven Men came on Shore and the three who remain'd  in the Boat put her off to a good Distance from the Shore and came to an Anchor to wait for them so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the Boat  Those that came on Shore kept close together marching towards the Top of the little Hill under which my Habitation lay and we could see them plainly though they could not perceive us We could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us so that we might have fir'd at them or that they would have gone farther off that we might have come abroad  But when they were come to the Brow of the Hill where they could see a great way into the Valleys and Woods which lay towards the  NorthEast  Part and where the Island lay lowest they shouted and hollow'd till they were weary and not caring it seems to venture far from the Shore nor far from one another they sat down together under a Tree to consider of it Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there as the other Party of them had done they had done the Jobb for us but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger to venture to go to sleep though they could not tell what the Danger was they had to fear neither  The Captain made a very just Proposal to me upon this Consultation of theirs  viz  That perhaps they would all fire a Volley again to endeavour to make their Fellows hear and that we should all Sally upon them just at the Juncture when their Pieces were all discharg'd and they would certainly yield and we should have them without Bloodshed I lik'd the Proposal provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before they could load their Pieces again  But this Event did not happen and we lay still a long Time very irresolute what Course to take at length I told them there would be nothing to be done in my Opinion till Night and then if they did not return to the Boat perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the Shore and so might use some Stratagem with them in the Boat to get them on Shore  We waited a great while though very impatient for their removing and were very uneasy when after long Consultations we saw them start all up and march down toward the Sea It seems they had such dreadful Apprehensions upon them of the Danger of the Place that they resolv'd to go on board the Ship again give their Companions over for lost and so go on with their intended Voyage with the Ship  As soon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore I imagin'd it to be as it really was That they had given over their Search and were for going back again and the Captain as soon as I told him my Thoughts was ready to sink at the Apprehensions of it but I presently thought of a Stratagem to fetch them back again and which answer'd my End to a Tittle  I order'd  Friday  and the Captain's Mate to go over the little Creek  Westward  towards the Place were the  Savages  came on Shore when  Friday  was rescu'd and as soon as they came to a little rising Ground at about half a Mile Distance I bad them hollow as loud as they could and wait till they found the Seamen heard them that as soon as ever they heard the Seamen answer them they should return it again and then keeping out of Sight take a round always answering when the other hollow'd to draw them as far into the Island and among the  Woods as possible and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed them  They were just going into the Boat when  Friday  and the Mate hollow'd and they presently heard them and answering run along the Shore  Westward  towards the Voice they heard when they were presently stopp'd by the Creek where the Water being up they could not get over and call'd for the Boat to come up and set them over as indeed I expected  When they had set themselves over I observ'd that the Boat being gone up a good way into the Creek and as it were in a Harbour within the Land they took one of the three Men out of her to go along with them and left only two in the Boat having fastned her to the Stump of a little Tree on the Shore  This was what I wish'd for and immediately leaving  Friday  and the Captain's Mate to their Business I took the rest with me and crossing the Creek out of their Sight we surpriz'd the two Men before they were aware one of them lying on Shore and the other being in the Boat the Fellow on Shore was between sleeping and waking and going to start up the Captain who was foremost ran in upon him and knock'd him down and then call'd out to him in the Boat to yield or he was a dead Man  There needed very few Arguments to perswade a single Man to yield when he saw five Men upon him and his Comrade knock'd down besides this was it seems one of the three who were not so hearty in the Mutiny as the rest of the Crew and therefore was easily perswaded not only to yield but afterwards to joyn very sincere with us  In the mean time  Friday  and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd their Business with the rest that they drew them by hollowing and answering from  one Hill to another and from one Wood to another till they not only heartily tyr'd them but left them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the Boat before it was dark and indeed they were heartily tyr'd themselves also by the Time they came back to us  We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the Dark and to fall upon them so as to make sure work with them  It was several Hours after  Friday  came back to me before they came back to their Boat and we could hear the foremost of them long before they came quite up calling to those behind to come along and could also hear them answer and complain how lame and tyr'd they were and not able to come any faster which was very welcome News to us  At length they came up to the Boat but 'tis impossible to express their Confusion when they found the Boat fast aGround in the Creek the Tide ebb'd out and their two Men gone We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable Manner telling one another they were gotten into an inchanted Island that either there were Inhabitants in it and they should all be murther'd or else there were Devils and Spirits in it and they should be all carry'd away and devour'd  They hallow'd again and call'd their two Comerades by their Names a great many times but no Answer After some time we could see them by the little Light there was run about wringing their Hands like Men in Despair and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the Boat to rest themselves then come ashore again and walk about again and so over the same thing again  My Men would fain have me given them Leave to fall upon them at once in the Dark but I was willing to take them at some Advantage so to spare them and kill as few of them as I could and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own Men knowing the other were very well armed I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate and therefore to make sure of them I drew my Ambuscade nearer and order'd  Friday  and the Captain to creep upon their Hands and Feet as close to the Ground as they could that they might not be discover'd and get as near them as they could possibly before they offered to fire  They had not been long in that Posture but that the Boatswain who was the principal Ringleader of the Mutiny and had now shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest came walking towards them with two more of their Crew the Captain was so eager as having this principal Rogue so much in his Power that he could hardly have Patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him for they only heard his Tongue before But when they came nearer the Captain and  Friday  starting up on their Feet let fly at them  The Boatswain was kill'd upon the Spot the next Man was shot into the Body and fell just by him tho' he did not die 'till an Hour or two after and the third run for it  At the Noise of the Fire I immediately advanc'd with my whole Army which was now Men  viz  my self  Generalissimo Friday  my LieutenantGeneral the Captain and his two Men and the three Prisoners of War who we had trusted with Arms  We came upon them indeed in the Dark so that they could not see our Number and I made the Man we had left in the Boat who was now one of us call to them by Name to try if I could bring them to a Parley and so might perhaps reduce them to Terms which fell out just as we desir'd for indeed it was easy to think as their Condition then was they would be very willing to capitulate so he calls out as loud as he could to one of them  Tom Smith Tom Smith Tom Smith  answered immediately  Who's that  Robinson for it seems he knew his Voice T'other answered  Ay ay for God's Sake  Tom Smith  throw down your Arms and yield  or  you are all dead Men this Moment    Who must we yield to where are they  says  Smith  again  Here they are  says he here's our Captain and fifty Men with him have been hunting you this two Hours the Boatswain is kill'd  Will Frye  is wounded and I am a Prisoner and if you do not yield you are all lost  Will they give us Quarter then says  Tom Smith  and we will yield  I'll go and ask if you promise to yield  says  Robinson  so he ask'd the Captain and the Captain then calls himself out You  Smith  you know my Voice if you lay down your Arms immediately and submit you shall have your Lives all but  Will Atkins    Upon this  Will Atkins  cry'd out  For God's Sake Captain give me Quarter what have I done They have been all as bad as I  which by the Way was not true neither for it seems this  Will Atkins  was the first Man that laid hold of the Captain when they first mutiny'd and used him barbarously in tying his Hands and giving him injurious Language However the Captain told him he must lay down his Arms at Discretion and trust to the Governour's  Mercy by which he meant me for they all call'd me Governour  In a Word they all laid down their Arms and begg'd their Lives and I sent the Man that had parley'd with them and two more who bound them all and then my great Army of Men which particularly with those three were all but eight came up and seiz'd upon them all and upon their Boat only that I kept my self and one more out of Sight for Reasons of State  Our next Work was to repair the Boat and think of seizing the Ship and as for the Captain now he had Leisure to parley with them He expostulated with them upon the Villany of their Practices with him and at length upon the farther Wickedness of their Design and how certainly it must bring them to Misery and Distress in the End and perhaps to the Gallows  They all appear'd very penitent and begg'd hard for their Lives as for that he told them they were none of his Prisoners but the Commander of the Island that they thought they had set him on Shore in a barren uninhabitated Island but it had pleased God so to direct them that the Island was inhabited and that the Governour was an  English  Man that he might hang them all there if he pleased but as he had given them all Quarter he supposed he would send them to  England  to be dealt with there as Justice requir'd except  Atkins  who he was commanded by the Governour to advise to prepare for Death for that he would be hang'd in the Morning  Though this was all a Fiction of his own yet it had its desired Effect  Atkins  fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to interceed with the Governour for his Life and all the rest beg'd of him  for God's Sake that they might not be sent to  England    It now occurr'd to me that the time of our Deliverance was come and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in to be hearty in getting Possession of the Ship so I retir'd in the Dark from them that they might not see what Kind of a Governour they had and call'd the Captain to me when I call'd as at a good Distance one of the Men was order'd to speak again and say to the Captain  Captain the Commander calls for you  and presently the Captain reply'd  Tell his Excellency I am just a coming  This more perfectly amused them and they all believed that the Commander was just by with his fifty Men  Upon the Captain's coming to me I told him my Project for seizing the Ship which he lik'd of wonderfully well and resolv'd to put it in Execution the next Morning  But in Order to execute it with more Art and secure of Success I told him we must divide the Prisoners and that he should go and take  Atkins  and two more of the worst of them and send them pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay This was committed to  Friday  and the two Men who came on Shore with the Captain  They convey'd them to the Cave as to a Prison and it was indeed a dismal Place especially to Men in their Condition  The other I order'd to my  Bower  as I call'd it of which I have given a full Description and as it was fenc'd in and they pinion'd the Place was secure enough considering they were upon their Behaviour  To these in the Morning I sent the Captain who was to enter into a Parley with them in a Word to try them and tell me whether he thought they  might be trusted or no to go on Board and surprize the Ship He talk'd to them of the Injury done him of the Condition they were brought to and that though the Governour had given them Quarter for their Lives as to the present Action yet that if they were sent to  England  they would all be hang'd in Chains to be sure but that if they would join in so just an Attempt as to recover the Ship he would have the Governour's Engagement for their Pardon  Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be accepted by Men in their Condition they fell down on their Knees to the Captain and promised with the deepest Imprecations that they would be faithful to him to the last Drop and that they should owe their Lives to him and would go with him all over the World that they would own him for a Father to them as long as they liv'd  Well says the Captain I must go and tell the Governour what you say and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it So he brought me an Account of the Temper he found them in and that he verily believ'd they would be faithful  However that we might be very secure I told him he should go back again and choose out five of them and tell them they might see that he did not want Men that he would take out five of them to be his Assistants and that the Governour would keep the other two and the three that were sent Prisoners to the Castle  my Cave  as Hostages for the Fidelity of those five and that if they prov'd unfaithful in the Execution the five Hostages should be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore  This look'd severe and convinc'd them that the Governour was in Earnest however they had no  Way left them but to accept it and it was now the Business of the Prisoners as much as of the Captain to perswade the other five to do their Duty  Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition The Captain his Mate and Passenger Then the two Prisoners of the first Gang to whom having their Characters from the Captain I had given their Liberty and trusted them with Arms The other two who I had kept till now in my Apartment pinion'd but upon the Captain's Motion had now releas'd The single Man taken in the Boat These five releas'd at last So that they were thirteen in all besides five we kept Prisoners in the Cave and the two Hostages  I ask'd the Captain if he was willing to venture with these Hands on Board the Ship for as for me and my Man  Friday  I did not think it was proper for us to stir having seven Men left behind and it was Employment enough for us to keep them assunder and supply them with Victuals  As to the five in the Cave I resolv'd to keep them fast but  Friday  went in twice a Day to them to supply them with Necessaries and I made the other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance where  Friday  was to take it  When I shew'd my self to the two Hostages it was with the Captain who told them I was the Person the Governour had order'd to look after them and that it was the Governour's Pleasure they should not stir any where but by my Direction that if they did they should be fetch'd into the Castle and be lay'd in Irons so that as we never suffered them to see me as Governour so I now appear'd as another Person and spoke of the  Governour the Garrison the Castle and the like upon all Occasions  The Captain now had no Difficulty before him but to furnish his two Boats stop the Breach of one and Man them He made his Passenger Captain of one with four other Men and himself and his Mate and six more went in the other And they contriv'd their Business very well for they came up to the Ship about Midnight As soon as they came within Call of the Ship he made  Robinson  hale them and tell them they had brought off the Men and the Boat but that it was a long time before they had found them and the like holding them in a Chat 'till they came to the Ship's Side when the Captain and the Mate entring first with their Arms immediately knock'd down the second Mate and Carpenter with the Butend of their Muskets being very faithfully seconded by their Men they secur'd all the rest that were upon the Main and Quarter Decks and began to fasten the Hatches to keep them down who were below when the other Boat and their Men entring at the fore Chains secur'd the ForeCastle of the Ship and the Scuttle which went down into the Cook Room making three Men they found there Prisoners  When this was done and all safe upon Deck the Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break into the RoundHouse where the new Rebel Captain lay and having taken the Alarm was gotten up and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire Arms in their Hands and when the Mate with a Crow split open the Door the new Captain and his Men fir'd boldly among them and wounded the Mate with a Musket Ball which broke his Arm and wounded two more of the Men but kill'd no Body  The Mate calling for Help rush'd however into the RoundHouse wounded as he was and with his Pistol shot the new Captain thro' the Head the Bullet entring at his Mouth and came out again behind one of his Ears so that he never spoke a Word upon which the rest yielded and the Ship was taken effectually without any more Lives lost  As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd the Captain order'd seven Guns to be fir'd which was the Signal agreed upon with me to give me Notice of his Success which you may be sure I was very glad to hear having sat watching upon the Shore for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning  Having thus heard the Signal plainly I laid me down and it having been a Day of great Fatigue to me I slept very sound 'till I was something surpriz'd with the Noise of a Gun and presently starting up I heard a Man call me by the Name of Governour Governour and presently I knew the Captain's Voice when climbing up to the Top of the Hill there he stood and pointing to the Ship he embrac'd me in his Arms  My dear Friend and Deliverer  says he  there's your Ship for she is all yours and so are we and all that belong to her  I cast my Eyes to the Ship and there she rode within little more than half a Mile of the Shore for they had weighed her Anchor as soon as they were Masters of her and the Weather being fair had brought her to an Anchor just against the Mouth of the little Creek and the Tide being up the Captain had brought the Pinnace in near the Place where I at first landed my Rafts and so landed just at my Door  I was at first ready to sink down with the Surprize For I saw my Deliverance indeed visibly put into my Hands all things easy and a large Ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased  to go At first for some time I was not able to answer him one Word but as he had taken me in his Arms I held fast by him or I should have fallen to the Ground  He perceived the Surprize and immediately pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket and gave me a Dram of Cordial which he had brought on Purpose for me after I had drank it I sat down upon the Ground and though it brought me to my self yet it was a good while before I could speak a Word to him  All this while the poor Man was in as great an Extasy as I only not under any Surprize as I was and he said a thousand kind tender things to me to compose me and bring me to my self but such was the Flood of Joy in my Breast that it put all my Spirits into Confusion at last it broke out into Tears and in a little while after I recovered my Speech  Then I took my Turn and embrac'd him as my Deliverer and we rejoyc'd together I told him I look upon him as a Man sent from Heaven to deliver me and that the whole Transaction seemed to be a Chain of Wonders that such things as these were the Testimonies we had of a secret Hand of Providence governing the World and an Evidence that the Eyes of an infinite Power could search into the remotest Corner of the World and send Help to the Miserable whenever he pleased  I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulness to Heaven and what Heart could forbear to bless him who had not only in a miraculous Manner provided for once in such a Wilderness and in such a desolate Condition but from whom every Deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed  When we had talk'd a while the Captain told me he had brought me some little Refreshment such as the Ship afforded and such as the Wretches that had been so long his Master had not plunder'd him of Upon this he call'd aloud to the Boat and bid his Men bring the things ashore that were for the Governour and indeed it was a Present as if I had been one not that was to be carry'd away along with them but as if I had been to dwell upon the Island still and they were to go without me  First he had brought me a Case of Bottles full of excellent Cordial Waters six large Bottles of  Madera  Wine the Bottles held two Quarts apiece two Pound of excellent good Tobacco twelve good Pieces of the Ship's Beef and six Pieces of Pork with a Bag of Pease and about a hundred Weight of Bisket  He brought me also a Box of Sugar a Box of Flower a Bag full of Lemons and two Bottles of LimeJuice and Abundance of other things But besides these and what was a thousand times more useful to me he brought me six clean new Shirts six very good Neckcloaths two Pair of Gloves one Pair of Shoes a Hat and one Pair of Stockings and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his own which had been worn but very little In a Word he cloathed me from Head to Foot  It was a very kind and agreeable Present as any one may imagine to one in my Circumstances But never was any thing in the World of that Kind so unpleasant awkard and uneasy as it was to me to wear such Cloaths at their first putting on  After these Ceremonies past and after all his good things were brought into my little Apartment we began to consult what was to be done with the Prisoners we had for it was worth considering  whether we might venture to take them away with us or no especially two of them who we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last Degree and the Captain said he knew they were such Rogues that there was no obliging them and if he did carry them away it must be in Irons as Malefactors to be delivered over to Justice at the first  English  Colony he could come at and I found that the Captain himself was very anxious about it  Upon this I told him that if he desir'd it I durst undertake to bring the two Men he spoke of to make it their own Request that he should leave them upon the Island  I should be very glad of that  says the Captain  with all my Heart    Well says I I will send for them up and talk with them for you so I caused  Friday  and the two Hostages for they were now discharg'd their Comrades having perform'd their Promise I say I caused them to go to the Cave and bring up the five Men pinion'd as they were to the Bower and keep them there 'till I came  After some time I came thither dress'd in my new Habit and now I was call'd Governour again being all met and the Captain with me I caused the Men to be brought before me and I told them I had had a full Account of their villanous Behaviour to the Captain and how they had run away with the Ship and were preparing to commit farther Robberies but that Providence had ensnar'd them in their own Ways and that they were fallen into the Pit which they had digged for others  I let them know that by my Direction the Ship had been seiz'd that she lay now in the Road and they might see by and by that their new Captain  had receiv'd the Reward of his Villany for that they might see him hanging at the YardArm  That as to them I wanted to know what they had to say why I should not execute them as Pirates taken in the Fact as by my Commission they could not doubt I had Authority to do  One of them answer'd in the Name of the rest That they had nothing to say but this That when they were taken the Captain promis'd them their Lives and they humbly implor'd my Mercy But I told them I knew not what Mercy to shew them for as for my self I had resolv'd to quit the Island with all my Men and had taken Passage with the Captain to go for  England  And as for the Captain he could not carry them to  England  other than as Prisoners in Irons to be try'd for Mutiny and running away with the Ship the Consequence of which they must needs know would be the Gallows so that I could not tell which was best for them unless they had a Mind to take their Fate in the Island if they desir'd that I did not care as I had Liberty to leave it I had some Inclination to give them their Lives if they thought they could shift on Shore  They seem'd very thankful for it said they would much rather venture to stay there than to be carry'd to  England  to be hang'd so I left it on that Issue  However the Captain seem'd to make some Difficulty of it as if he durst not leave them there Upon this I seem'd a little angry with the Captain and told him That they were my Prisoners not his and that seeing I had offered them so much Favour I would be as good as my Word and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at Liberty as I found them and  if he did not like it he might take them again if he could catch them  Upon this they appear'd very thankful and I accordingly set them at Liberty and bad them retire into the Woods to the Place whence they came and I would leave them some Fire Arms some Ammunition and some Directions how they should live very well if they thought fit  Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship but told the Captain that I would stay that Night to prepare my things and desir'd him to go on Board in the mean time and keep all right in the Ship and send the Boat on Shore the next Day for me ordering him in the mean time to cause the new Captain who was kill'd to be hang'd at the YardArm that these Men might see him  When the Captain was gone I sent for the Men up to me to my Apartment and entred seriously into Discourse with them of their Circumstances I told them I thought they had made a right Choice that if the Captain carry'd them away they would certainly be hang'd I shewed them the new Captain hanging at the YardArm of the Ship and told them they had nothingless to expect  When they had all declar'd their Willingness to stay I then told them I would let them into the Story of my living there and put them into the Way of making it easy to them Accordingly I gave them the whole History of the Place and of my coming to it shew'd them my Fortifications the Way I made my Bread planted my Corn cured my Grapes and in a Word all that was necessary to make them easy I told them the Story also of the sixteen  Spaniards  that were to be expected for whom I left a Letter and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves  I left them my Fire Arms  viz  Five Muskets three Fowling Pieces and three Swords I had above a Barrel and half of Powder left for after the first Year or two I used but little and wasted none I gave them a Description of the Way I manag'd the Goats and Directions to milk and fatten them and to make both Butter and Cheese  In a Word I gave them every Part of my own Story and I told them I would prevail with the Captain to leave them two Barrels of GunPowder more and some GardenSeeds which I told them I would have been very glade of also I gave them the Bag of Pease which the Captain had brought me to eat and bad them be sure to sow and encrease them  Having done all this I left them the next Day and went on Board the Ship We prepared immediately to sail but did not weigh that Night The next Morning early two of the five Men came swiming to the Ship's Side and making a most lamentable Complaint of the other three begged to be taken into the Ship for God's Sake for they should be murthered and begg'd the Captain to take them on Board tho' he hang'd them immediately  Upon this the Captain pretended to have no Power without me But after some Difficulty and after their solemn Promises of Amendment they were taken and were some time after soundly whipp'd and pickl'd after which they prov'd very honest and quiet Fellows  Some time after this the Boat was order'd on Shore the Tide being up with the things promised to the Men to which the Captain at my Intercession caused their Chests and Cloaths to be aded which they took and were very thankful for I also encourag'd them by telling them that if  it lay in my Way to send any Vessel to take them in I would not forget them  When I took leave of this Island I carry'd on board for Reliques the great Goat'sSkinCap I had made my Umbrella and my Parrot also I forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention'd which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnish'd and could hardly pass for Silver till it had been a little rubb'd and handled as also the Money I found in the Wreck of the  Spanish  Ship  And thus I left the Island the Nineteenth of  December  as I found by the Ship's Account in the Year after I had been upon it eight and twenty Years two Months and Days being deliver'd from this second Captivity the same Day of the Month that I first made my Escape in the  BarcoLongo  from among the  Moors  of  Sallee    In this Vessel after a long Voyage I arriv'd in  England  the Eleventh of  June  in the Year having been thirty and five Years absent  When I came to  England  I was as perfect a Stranger to all the World as if I had never been known there My Benefactor and faithful Steward who I had left in Trust with my Money was alive but had had great Misfortunes in the World was become a Widow the second Time and very low in the World I made her easy as to what she ow'd me assuring her I would give her no Trouble but on the contrary in Gratitude to her former Care and Faithfulness to me I reliev'd her as my little Stock would afford which at that Time would indeed allow me to do but little for her but I assur'd her I would never forget her former Kindness to me nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her as shall be observ'd in its Place  I went down afterwards into  Yorkshire  but my Father was dead and my Mother and all the Family extinct except that I found two Sisters and two of the Children of one of my Brothers and as I had been long ago given over for dead there had been no Provision made for me so that in a Word I found nothing to relieve or assist me and that little Money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the World  I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed which I did not expect and this was That the Master of the Ship who I had so happily deliver'd and by the same Means sav'd the Ship and Cargo having giving a very handsome Account to the Owners of the Manner how I had sav'd the Lives of the Men and the Ship they invited me to meet them and some other Merchants concern'd and altogether made me a very handsome Compliment upon the Subject and a Present of almost two hundred Pounds Sterling  But after making several Reflections upon the Circumstances of my Life and how little way this would go towards settling me in the World I resolv'd to go to  Lisbon  and see if I might not come by some Information of the State of my Plantation in the  Brasils  and of what was become of my Partner who I had reason to suppose had some Years now given me over for dead  With this View I took Shipping for  Lisbon  where I arriv'd in  April  following my Man  Friday  accompanying me very honestly in all these Ramblings and proving a most faithful Servant upon all Occasions  When I came to  Lisbon  I found out by Enquiry and to my particular Satisfaction my old Friend the Captain of the Ship who first took me up at Sea off of the Shore of  Africk  He was now  grown old and had left off the Sea having put his Son who was far from a young Man into his Ship and who still used the  Brasil  Trade The old Man did not know me and indeed I hardly knew him but I soon brought him to my Remembrance and as soon brought my self to his Remembrance when I told him who I was  After some passionate Expressions of the old Acquaintance I enquir'd you may be sure after my Plantation and my Partner The old Man told me he had not been in the  Brasils  for about nine Years but that he could assure me that when he came away my Partner was living but the Trustees who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of my Part were both dead that however he believ'd that I would have a very good Account of the Improvement of the Plantation for that upon the general Belief of my being cast away and drown'd my Trustees had given in the Account of the Produce of my Part of the Plantation to the Procurator Fiscal who had appropriated it in Case I never came to claim it one Third to the King and two Thirds to the Monastery of St  Augustine  to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor and for the Conversion of the  Indians  to the Catholick Faith but that if I appear'd or any one for me to claim the Inheritance it should be restor'd only that the Improvement or Annual Production being distributed to charitable Uses could not be restor'd but he assur'd me that the Steward of the King's Revenue from Lands and the Proviedore or Steward of the Monastery had taken great Care all along that the Incumbent that is to say my Partner gave every Year a faithful Account o the Produce of which they receiv'd duly my Moiety  I ask'd him if he knew to what height of Improvement he had brought the Plantation And Whether he thought it might be worth looking after Or Whether on my going thither I should meet with no Obstruction to my Possessing my just Right in the Moiety  He told me he could not tell exactly to what Degree the Plantation was improv'd but this he knew that my Partner was grown exceeding Rich upon the enjoying but one half of it and that to the best of his Remembrance he had heard that the King's Third of my Part which was it seems granted away to some other Monastery or Religious House amounted to above two hundred Moidores a Year that as to my being restor'd to a quiet Possession of it there was no question to be made of that my Partner being alive to witness my Title and my Name being also enrolled in the Register of the Country also he told me That the Survivors of my two Trustees were very fair honest People and very Wealthy and he believ'd I would not only have their Assistance for putting me in Possession but would find a very considerable Sum of Money in their Hands for my Account being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers held the Trust and before it was given up as above which as he remember'd was for about twelve Years  I shew'd my self a little concern'd and uneasy at this Account and enquir'd of the old Captain How it came to pass that the Trustees should thus dispose my Effects when he knew that I had made my Will and had made him the  Portuguese  Captain my universal Heir  c  He told me that was true but that as there was no Proof of my being dead he could not act as Executor until some certain Account should  come of my Death and that besides he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote that it was true he had registred my Will and put in his Claim and could he have given any Account of my being dead or alive he would have acted by Procuration and taken Possession of the  Ingenio  so they call'd the SugarHouse and had given his Son who was now at the  Brasils  Order to do it  But says the old Man I have one Piece of News to tell you which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest and that is That believing you were lost and all the World believing so also your Partner and Trustees did offer to accompt to me in your Name for six or eight of the first Years of Profits which I receiv'd but there being at the time says he great Disbursments for encreasing the Works building an  Ingenio  and buying Slaves it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced However says the old Man I shall give you a true Account of what I have received in all and how I have disposed of it  After a few Days farther Conference with this ancient Friend he brought me an Account of the six first Years Income of my Plantation sign'd by my Partner and the Merchants Trustees being always deliver'd in Goods  viz  Tobacco in Roll and Sugar in Chests besides Rum Molossus  c  which is the Consequence of a Sugar Work and I found by this Account that every Year the Income considerably encreased but as above the Disbursement being large the Sum at first was small However the old Man let me see that he was Debtor to me Moidores of Gold besides Chests of Sugar and double Rolls of Tobacco which were lost in his Ship he having been  Shipwreck'd coming Home to  Lisbon  about Years after my leaving the Place  The good Man then began to complain of his Misfortunes and how he had been obliged to make Use of my Money to recover his Losses and buy him a Share in a new Ship However my old Friend says he you shall not want a Supply in your Necessity and as soon as my Son returns you shall be fully satisfy'd  Upon this he pulls out an old Pouch and gives me  Portugal  Moidores in Gold and giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship which his Son was gone to the  Brasils  in of which he was a Quarter Part Owner and his Son another he puts them both into my Hands for Security of the rest  I was too much mov'd with the Honesty and Kindness of the poor Man to be able to bear this and remembring what he had done for me how he had taken me up at Sea and how generously he had used me on all Occasions and particularly how sincere a Friend he was now to me I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he said to me Therefore first I asked him if his Circumstances admitted him to spare so much Money at that time and if it would not straiten him He told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little but however it was my Money and I might want it more than he  Every thing the good Man said was full of Affection and I could hardly refrain from Tears while he spoke In short I took of the Moidores and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt for them then I returned him the rest and told him If ever I had Possession of the Plantation I would return the other to him also as indeed I afterwards did and that as to the Bill of Sale of  his Part in his Son's Ship I would not take it by any Means but that if I wanted the Money I found he was honest enough to pay me and if I did not but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect I would never have a Penny more from him  When this was pass'd the old Man began to ask me If he should put me into a Method to make my Claim to my Plantation I told him I thought to go over to it my self He said I might do so if I pleas'd but that if I did not there were Ways enough to secure my Right and immediately to appropriate the Profits to my Use and as there were Ships in the River of  Lisbon  just ready to go away to  Brasil  he made me enter my Name in a Publick Register with his Affidavit affirming upon Oath that I was alive and that I was the same Person who took up the Land for the Planting the said Plantation at first  This being regularly attested by a Notary and a Procuration affix'd he directed me to send it with a Letter of his Writing to a Merchant of his Acquaintance at the Place and then propos'd my staying with him till an Account came of the Return  Never any Thing was more honourable than the Proceedings upon this Procuration for in less than seven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from the Survivors of my Trustees the Merchants for whose Account I went to Sea in which were the following particular Letters and Papers enclos'd  First  There was the Account Current of the Produce of my Farm or Plantation from the Year when their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old  Portugal  Captain being for six Years the Ballance appear'd to be Moidores in my Favour  Secondly  There was the Account of four Years more while they kept the Effects in their Hands before the Government claim'd the Administration as being the Effects of a Person not to be found which they call'd  Civil Death  and the Ballance of this the Value of the Plantation encreasing amounted to Cruisadoes which made Moidores  Thirdly  There was the Prior of the  Augustin  's Account who had receiv'd the Profits for above fourteen Years but not being to account for what was dispos'd to the Hospital very honestly declar'd he had Moidores not distributed which he acknowledged to my Account as to the King's Part that refunded nothing  There was a Letter of my Partner's congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive giving me an Account how the Estate was improv'd and what it produced a Year with a Particular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it contained how planted how many Slaves there were upon it and making two and twenty Crosses for Blessings told me he had said so many  Ave Marias  to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive inviting me very passionately to come over and take Possession of my own and in the mean time to give him Orders to whom he should deliver my Effects if I did not come my self concluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendship and that of his Family and sent me as a Present seven fine Leopard's Skins which he had it seems received from  Africa  by some other Ship which he had sent thither and who it seems had made a better Voyage than I He sent me also five Chests of excellent Sweetmeats and an hundred Pieces of Gold uncoin'd not quite so large as Moidores  By the same Fleet my two Merchant Trustees shipp'd me Chests of Sugar Rolls of Tobacco and the rest of the whole Accompt in Gold  I might well say now indeed That the latter End of  Job  was better than the Beginning It is impossible to express here the Flutterings of my very Heart when I look'd over these Letters and especially when I found all my Wealth about me for as the  Brasil  Ships come all in Fleets the same Ships which brought my Letters brought my Goods and the Effects were safe in the River before the Letters came to my Hand In a Word I turned pale and grew sick and had not the old Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial I believe the sudden Surprize of Joy had overset Nature and I had dy'd upon the Spot  Nay after that I continu'd very ill and was so some Hours 'till a Physician being sent for and something of the real Cause of my Illness being known he order'd me to be let Blood after which I had Relief and grew well But I verily believe if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given in that Manner to the Spirits I should have dy'd  I was now Master all on a Sudden of above  l Sterling  in Money and had an Estate as I might well call it in the  Brasils  of above a thousand Pounds a Year as sure as an Estate of Lands in  England  And in a Word I was in a Condition which I scarce knew how to understand or how to compose my self for the Enjoyment of it  The first thing I did was to recompense my original Benefactor my good old Captain who had been first charitable to me in my Distress kind to me in my Beginning and honest to me at the End I shew'd him all that was sent me I  told him that next to the Providence of Heaven which disposes all things it was owing to him and that it now lay on me to reward him which I would do a hundred fold So I first return'd to him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him then I sent for a Notary and caused him to draw up a general Release or Discharge for the Moidores which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd me in the fullest and firmest Manner possible after which I caused a Procuration to be drawn impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual Profits of my Plantation and appointing my Partner to accompt to him and make the Returns by the usual Fleets to him in my Name and a Clause in the End being a Grant of Moidores a Year to him during his Life out of the Effects and Moidores a Year to his Son after him for his Life And thus I requited my old Man  I was now to consider which Way to steer my Course next and what to do with the Estate that Providence had thus put into my Hands and indeed I had more Care upon my Head now than I had in my silent State of Life in the Island where I wanted nothing but what I had and had nothing but what I wanted Whereas I had now a great Charge upon me and my Business was how to secure it I had ne'er a Cave now to hide my Money in or a Place where it might lye without Lock or Key 'till it grew mouldy and tarnish'd before any Body would meddle with it On the contrary I knew not where to put it or who to trust with it My old Patron the Captain indeed was honest and that was the only Refuge I had  In the next Place my Interest in the  Brasils  seem'd to summon me thither but now I could not tell how to think of going thither 'till I had  settled my Affairs and left my Effects in some safe Hands behind me At first I thought of my old Friend the Widow who I knew was honest and would be just to me but then she was in Years and but poor and for ought I knew might be in Debt so that in a Word I had no Way but to go back to  England  my self and take my Effects with me  It was some Months however before I resolved upon this and therefore as I had rewarded the old Captain fully and to his Satisfaction who had been my former Benefactor so I began to think of my poor Widow whose Husband had been my first Benefactor and she while it was in her Power my faithful Steward and Instructor So the first thing I did I got a Merchant in  Lisbon  to write to his Correspondent in  London  not only to pay a Bill but to go find her out and carry her in Money an hundred Pounds from me and to talk with her and comfort her in her Poverty by telling her she should if I liv'd have a further Supply At the same time I sent my two Sisters in the Country each of them an Hundred Pounds they being though not in Want yet not in very good Circumstances one having been marry'd and left a Widow and the other having a Husband not so kind to her as he should be  But among all my Relations or Acquaintances I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the Gross of my Stock that I might go away to the  Brasils  and leave things safe behind me and this greatly perplex'd me  I had once a Mind to have gone to the  Brasils  and have settled my self there for I was as it were naturaliz'd to the Place but I had some little Scruple in my Mind about Religion which insensibly drew me back of which I shall say  more presently However it was not Religion that kept me from going there for the present and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Religion of the Country all the while I was among them so neither did I yet only that now and then having of late thought more of it than formerly when I began to think of living and dying among them I began to regret my having profess'd my self a Papist and thought it might not be the best Religion to die with  But as I have said this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the  Brasils  but that really I did not know with whom to leave my Effects behind me so I resolv'd at last to go to  England  with it where if I arrived I concluded I should make some Acquaintance or find some Relations that would be faithful to me and according I prepar'd to go for  England  with all my Wealth  In order to prepare things for my going Home I first the  Brasil  Fleet being just going away resolved to give Answers suitable to the just and faithful Account of things I had from thence and first to the Prior of St  Augustine  I wrote a Letter full of Thanks for their just Dealings and the Offer of the Moidores which was indisposed of which I desir'd might be given to the Monastery and to the Poor as the Prior should direct desiring the good  Padres  Prayers for me and the like  I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two Trustees with all the Acknowledgment that so much Justice and Honesty call'd for as for sending them any Present they were far above having any Occasion of it  Lastly  I wrote to my Partner acknowledging his Industry in the Improving the Plantation and his Integrity in encreasing the Stock of the Works giving him Instructions for his future Government  of my Part according to the Powers I had left with my old Patron to whom I desir'd him to send whatever became due to me 'till he should hear from me more particularly assuring him that it was my Intention not only to come to him but to settle my self there for the Remainder of my Life To this I added a very handsom Present of some  Italian  Silks for his Wife and two Daughters for such the Captain's Son inform'd me he had with two Pieces of fine  English  broad Cloath the best I could get in  Lisbon  five Pieces of black Bays and some  Flanders  Lace of a good Value  Having thus settled my Affairs sold my Cargoe and turn'd all my Effects into good Bills of Exchange my next Difficulty was which Way to go to  England  I had been accustom'd enough to the Sea and yet I had a strange Aversion to going to  England  by Sea at that time and though I could give no Reason for it yet the Difficulty encreas'd upon me so much that though I had once shipp'd my Baggage in order to go yet I alter'd my Mind and that not once but two or three times  It is true I had been very unfortunate by Sea and this might be some of the Reason But let no Man slight the strong Impulses of his own Thoughts in Cases of such Moment Two of the Ships which I had singl'd out to go in I mean more particularly singl'd out than any other that is to say so as in one of them to put my things on Board and in the other to have agreed with the Captain I say two of these Ships miscarry'd  viz  One was taken by the  Algerine  and the other was cast away on the  Start  near  Torbay  and all the People drown'd except three so that in either of those Vessels I had been made miserable and in which most it was hard to say  Having been thus harass'd in my Thoughts my old Pilot to whom I communicated every thing press'd me earnestly not to go by Sea but either to go by Land to the  Groyne  and cross over the Bay of  Biscay  to  Rochell  from whence it was but an easy and safe Journey by Land to  Paris  and so to  Calais  and  Dover  or to go up to  Madrid  and so all the Way by Land thro'  France    In a Word I was so prepossess'd against my goingt by Sea at all except from  Calais  to  Dover  than I resolv'd to travel all the Way by Land whice as I was not in Haste and did not value th  Charge was by much the pleasanter Way and to make it more so my old Captain brought an  English  Gentleman the Son of a Merchant in  Lisbon  who was willing to travel with me After which we pick'd up two more  English  Merchants also and two young  Portuguese  Gentlemen the last going to  Paris  only so that we were in all six of us and five Servants the two Merchants and the two  Portuguese  contenting themselves with one Servant between two to save the Charge and as for me I got an  English  Sailor to travel with me as a Servant besides my Man  Friday  who was too much a Stranger to be capable of supplying the Place of a Servant on the Road  In this Manner I set out from  Lisbon  and our Company being all very well mounted and armed we made a little Troop whereof they did me the Honour to call me Captain as well because I was the oldest Man as because I had two Servants and indeed was the Original of the whole Journey  As I have troubled you with none of my SeaJournals so I shall trouble you now with none of my LandJournal But some Adventures that happen'd  to us in this tedious and difficult Journey I must not omit  When we came to  Madrid  we being all of us Strangers to  Spain  were willing to stay some time to see the Court of  Spain  and to see what was worth observing but it being the latter Part of the Summer we hasten'd away and set out from  Madrid  about the Middle of  October  But when we came to the Edge of  Navarre  we were alarm'd at several Towns on the Way with an Account that so much Snow was fallen on the  French  Side of the Mountains that several Travellers were obliged to come back to  Pampeluna  after having attempted at an extream Hazard to pass on  When we came to  Pampeluna  it self we found it so indeed and to me that had been always used to a hot Climate and indeed to Countries where we could scarce bear any Cloaths on the Cold was insufferable nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising to come but ten Days before out of the old Castile where the Weather was not only warm but very hot and immediately to feel a Wind from the  Pyrenean  Mountains so very keen so severely cold as to be intollerable and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our Fingers and Toes  Poor  Friday  was really frighted when he saw the Mountains all cover'd with Snow and felt cold Weather which he had never seen or felt before in his Life  To mend the Matter when we came to  Pampeluna  it continued snowing with so much Violence and so long that the People said Winter was come before its time and the Roads which were difficult before were now quite impassable For in a Word the Snow lay in some Places too thick for us to travel and being not hard frozen as  is the Case in Northern Countries There was no going without being in Danger of being bury'd alive every Step We stay'd no less than twenty Days at  Pampeluna  when seeing the Winter coming on and no Likelihood of its being better for it was the severest Winter all over  Europe  that had been known in the Memory of Man I propos'd that we should all go away ro  Fonterabia  and there take Shipping for  Bourdeaux  which was a very little Voyage  But while we were considering this there came in four  French  Gentlemen who having been stopp'd on the  French  Side of the Passes as we were on the  Spanish  had found out a Guide who traversing the Country near the Head of  Languedoc  had brought them over the Mountains by such Ways that they were not much incommoded with the Snow and where they met with Snow in any Quantity they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their Horses  We sent for this Guide who told us he would undertake to carry us the same Way with no Hazard from the Snow provided we were armed sufficiently to protect our selves from wild Beasts for he said upon these great Snows it was frequent for some Wolves to show themselves at the Foot of the Mountains being made ravenous for Want of Food the Ground being covered with Snow We told him we were well enough prepar'd for such Creatures as they were if he would ensure us from a Kind of twolegged Wolves which we were told we were in most Danger from especially on the  French  Side of the Mountains  He satisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind in the Way that we were to go so we readily agreed to follow him as did also twelve other Gentlemen  with their Servants some  French  some  Spanish  who as I said had attempted to go and were oblig'd to come back again  Accordingly we all set out from  Pampeluna  with our Guide on the fifteenth of  November  and indeed I was surpriz'd when instead of going forward he came directly back with us on the same Road that we came from  Madrid  above twenty Miles when being pass'd two Rivers and come into the plain Country we found our selves in a warm Climate again where the Country was pleasant and no Snow to be seen but on a sudden turning to his left he approach'd the Mountains another Way and though it is true the Hills and Precipices look'd dreadful yet he made so many Tours such Meanders and led us by such winding Ways that we were insensibly pass'd the Height of the Mountains without being much imcumbred with the Snow and all on a sudden he shew'd us the pleasant fruitful Provinces of  Languedoc  and  Gascoign  all green and flourishing tho' indeed it was at a great Distance and we had some rough Way to pass yet  We were a little uneasy however when we found it snow'd one whole Day and a Night so fast that we could not travel but he bid us be easy we should soon be past it all We found indeed that we began to descend every Day and to come more  North  than before and so depending upon our Guide we went on  It was about two Hours before Night when our Guide being something before us and not just in Sight out rushed three monstrous Wolves and after them a Bear out of a hollow Way adjoyning to a thick Wood two of the Wolves flew upon the Guide and had he been half a Mile before us he had been devour'd indeed before we could  have help'd him One of them fastned upon his Horse and the other attack'd the Man with that Violence that he had not Time or not Presence of Mind enough to draw his Pistol but hollow'd and cry'd out to us most lustily my Man  Friday  being next me I bid him ride up and see what was the Matter as soon as  Friday  came in Sight of the Man he hollow'd as loud as t'other  O Master O Master  But like a bold Fellow rode directly up to the poor Man and with his Pistol shot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head  It was happy for the poor Man that it was my Man  Friday  for he having been us'd to that kind of Creature in his Country had no Fear upon him but went close up to him and shot him as above whereas any of us would have fir'd at a farther Distance and have perhaps either miss'd the Wolf or endanger'd shooting the Man  But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder Man than I and indeed it alarm'd all our Company when with the Noise of  Friday  's Pistol we heard on both Sides the dismallest Howling of Wolves and the Noise redoubled by the Eccho of the Mountains that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious Multitude of them and perhaps indeed there was not such a Few as that we had no cause of Apprehensions  However as  Friday  had kill'd this Wolf the other that had fastned upon the Horse left him immediately and fled having happily fastned upon his Head where the Bosses of the Bridle had stuck in his Teeth so that he had not done him much Hurt The Man indeed was most Hurt for the raging Creature had bit him twice once on the Arm and the other Time a little above his Knee and he was just as it were tumbling down by the  Disorder of his Horse when  Friday  came up and shot the Wolf  It is easy to suppose that at the Noise of  Friday  's Pistol we all mended our Pace and rid up as fast as the Way which was very difficult would give us leave to see what was the Matter as soon as we came clear of the Trees which blinded us before we saw clearly what had been the Case and how  Friday  had disengag'd the poor Guide though we did not presently discern what kind of Creature it was he had kill'd  But never was a Fight manag'd so hardily and in such a surprizing Manner as that which follow'd between  Friday  and the Bear which gave us all though at first we were surpriz'd and afraid for him the greatest Diversion imaginable As the Bear is a heavy clumsey Creature and does not gallop as the Wolf does who is swift and light so he has two particular Qualities which generally are the Rule of his Actions First As to Men who are not his proper Prey I say not his proper Prey because tho' I cannot say what exce  ive Hunger might do which was now their Case the Ground being all cover'd with Snow but as to Men he does not usually attempt them unless they first attack him On the contrary if you meet him in the Woods if you don't meddle with him he won't meddle with you but then you must take Care to be very Civil to him and give him the Road for he is a very nice Gentleman he won't go a Step out of his Way for a Prince nay if you are really afraid your best way is to look another Way and keep going on for sometimes if you stop and stand still and look steadily at him he takes it for an Affront but if you throw or toss any Thing at him and it hits him though it were but a bit of a Stick as big as your Finger he takes it for an Affront and sets all  his other Business aside to pursue his Revenge for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour that is his first Quality The next is That if he be once affronted he will never leave you Night or Day till he has his Revenge but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you  My Man  Friday  had deliver'd our Guide and when we came up to him he was helping him off from his Horse for the Man was both hurt and frighted and indeed the last more than the first when on the sudden we spy'd the Bear come out of the Wood and a vast monstrous One it was the biggest by far that ever I saw We were all a little surpriz'd when we saw him but when  Friday  saw him it was easy to see Joy and Courage in the Fellow's Countenance  O O O  Says  Friday  three Times pointing to him  O  Master  You give me te Leave Me shakee te Hand with him Me make you good laugh  I was surpriz'd to see the Fellow so pleas'd  You Fool you  says I  he will eat you up Eatee me up Eatee me up  Says  Friday  twice over again  Me eatee him up  ake you good laugh You all stay here me show you good laugh  so down he sits and gets his Boots off in a Moment and put on a Pair of Pumps as we call the flat Shoes they wear and which he had in his Pocket gives my other Servant his Horse and with his Gun away he flew swift like the Wind  The Bear was walking softly on and offer'd to meddle with no Body till  Friday  coming pretty near calls to him as if the Bear could understand him  Hark ye hark ye  says  Friday me speakee wit you  We follow'd at a Distance for now being come down on the  Gascoign  side of the Mountains we were entred a vast great Forest where the Country was plain and pretty open though many Trees in it scatter'd here and there  Friday  who had as we say the Heels of the Bear came up with him quickly and takes up a great Stone and throws at him and hit him just on the Head but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a Wall but it answer'd  Friday  's End for the Rogue was so void of Fear that he did it purely to make the Bear follow him and show us some Laugh as he call'd it  As soon as the Bear felt the Stone and saw him he turns about and comes after him taking Devilish long Strides and shuffling along at a strange Rate so as would have put a Horse to a mid  ing Gallop away runs  Friday  and takes his Course as if he run towards us for Help so we all resolv'd to fire at once upon the Bear and deliver my Man though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the Bear back upon us when he was going about his own Business another Way and especially I was angry that he had turn'd the Bear upon us and then run away and I call'd out  You Dog  said I  is this your making us laugh Come away and take your Horse that we may shoot the Creat  he hears me and crys out  No shoot no shoot stand still you get much Laugh  And as the nimble Creature run two Foot for the Beast's one he turn'd on a sudden on one side of us and seeing a great OakTree fit for his Purpose he beckon'd to us to follow and doubling his Pace he gets nimbly up the Tree laying his Gun down upon the Ground at about five or six Yards from the Bottom of the Tree  The Bear soon came to the Tree and we follow'd at a Distance the first Thing he did he stopp'd at the Gun smelt to it but let it lye and up he scrambles into the Tree climbing like a Cat though so monstrously heavy I was amaz'd at the Folly as I thought it of my Man and could not for my Life see any Thing to laugh at yet till seeing  the Bear get up the Tree we all rod nearer to him  When we came to the Tree there was  Friday  got out to the small End of a large Limb of the Tree and the Bear got about half way to him as soon as the Bear got out to that part where the Limb of the Tree was weaker  Ha  says he to us  now you see me teachee the Bear dance  so he falls a jumping and shaking the Bough at which the Bear began to totter but stood still and begun to look behind him to see how he should get back then indeed we did laugh heartily But  Friday  had not done with him by a great deal when he sees him stand still he calls out to him again as if he had suppos'd the Bear could speak  English What you no come farther pray you come farther  so he left jumping and shaking the Trees and the Bear just as if he had understood what he said did come a little further then he fell a jumping again and the Bear stopp'd again  We thought  was a good time to knock him on the Head  call'd to  Friday  to stand still and we would shoot the Bear but he cry'd out earnestly  O pray O pray No shoot me shoot by and then  he would have said  By and by  However to shorten the Story  Friday  danc'd so much and the Bear stood so ticklish that we had laughing enough indeed but still could not imagine what the Fellow would do for first we thought he depended upon shaking the Bear off and we found the Bear was too cunning for that too for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down but clings fast with his great broad Claws and Feet so that we could not imagine what would be the End of it and where the Jest would be at last  But  Friday  put us out of doubt quickly for seeing the Bear cling fast to the Bough and that he would not be perswaded to come any farther  Well well  says  Friday you no come farther me go me go you no come to me me go come to you  and upon this he goes out to the smallest End of the Bough where it would bend with his Weight and gently lets himself down by it sliding down the Bough till he came near enough to jump down on his Feet and away he run to his Gun takes it up and stands still  Well said I to him  Friday  What will you do now Why don't you shoot him  No shoot  says  Friday no yet me shoot now me no kill me stay give you one more laugh  and indeed so he did as you will see presently for when the Bear see his Enemy gone he comes back from the Bough where he stood but did it mighty leisurely looking behind him every Step and coming backward till he got into the Body of the Tree then with the same hinder End foremost he came down the Tree grasping it with his Claws an  oving one Foot at a Time very leisurely at this Juncture and just before he could set his hind Feet upon the Ground  Friday  stept up close to him clapt the Muzzle of his Piece into his Ear and shot him dead as a Stone  Then the Rogue turn'd about to see if we did not laugh and when he saw we were pleas'd by our Looks he falls a laughing himself very loud  so we kill Bear in my Country  says  Friday  so you kill them says I Why you have no Guns  No  says he  no Gun but shoot great much long Arrow    This was indeed a good Diversion to us but we were still in a wild Place and our Guide very much hurt and what to do we hardly knew the Howling of Wolves run much in my Head and indeed  except the Noise I once heard on the Shore of  Africa  of which I have said something already I never heard any thing that filled me with so much Horrour  These things and the Approach of Night called us off or else as  Friday  would have had us we should certainly have taken the Skin of this monstrous Creature off which was worth saving but we had three Leagues to go and our Guide hasten'd us so we left him and went forward on our Journey  The Ground was still cover'd with Snow tho' not so deep and dangerous as on the Mountains and the ravenous Creatures as we heard afterwards were come down into the Forest and plain Country press'd by Hunger to seek for Food and had done a great deal of Mischief in the Villages where they surpriz'd the Country People kill'd a great many of their Sheep and Horses and some People too  We had one dangerous Place to pass which our Guide told  if there were any more Wolves in the Country we should find them there and this was in a small Plain surrounded with Woods on every Side and a long narrow Defile or Lane which we were to pass to get through the Wood and then we should come to the Village where we were to lodge  It was within half an Hour of Sunset when we entred the first Wood and a little after Sunset when we came into the Plain we met with nothing in the first Wood except that in a little Plain within the Wood which was not above two Furlongs over we saw five great Wolves cross the Road full Speed one after another as if they had been in Chase of some Prey and had it in View  they took no Notice of us and were gone and out of our Sight in a few Moments  Upon this our Guide who by the Way was a wretched fainthearted Fellow bid us keep in a ready Posture for he believed there were more Wolves a coming  We kept our Arms ready and our Eyes about us but we saw no more Wolves 'till we came thro' that Wood which was near half a League and entred the Plain as soon as we came into the Plain we had Occasion enough to look about us The first Object we met with was a dead Horse that is to say a poor Horse which the Wolves had kill'd and at least a Dozen of them at Work we could not say eating of him but picking of his Bones rather for they had eaten up all the Flesh before  We did not think fit to disturb them at their Feast neither did they take much Notice of us  Friday  would have let fly at them but I would not suffer him by any Means for I found we were like to have more Business upon our Hands than we were aware of We were not gone half over the Plain but we began to hear the Wolves howl in the Wood on our Left in a frightful Manner and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us all in a Body and most of them in a Line as regularly as an Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers I scarce knew in what Manner to receive them but found to draw our selves in a close Line was the only Way so we form'd in a Moment But that we might not have too much Interval I order'd that only every other Man should fire and that the others who had not fir'd should stand ready to give them a second Volley immediately if they continued to advance upon us and that then  those who had fir'd at first should not pretend to load their Fusees again but stand ready with every one a Pistol for we were all arm'd with a Fusee and a Pair of Pistols each Man so we were by this Method able to fire six Volleys half of us at a Time however at present we had no Necessity for upon firing the first Volley the Enemy made a full Stop being terrify'd as well with the Noise as with the Fire four of them being shot into the Head dropp'd several others were wounded and went bleeding off as we could see by the Snow I found they stopp'd but did not immediately retreat whereupon remembring that I had been told that the fiercest Creatures were terrify'd at the Voice of a Man I caus'd all our Company to hollow as loud as we could and I found the Notion not altogether mistaken for upon our Shout they began to retire and turn about then I order'd a second Volley to be fir'd in their Rear which put them to the Gallop and away they went to the Woods  This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again and that we might loose no Time we kept going but we had but little more than loaded our Fusees and put our selves into a Readiness when we heard a terrible Noise in the same Wood on our Left only that it was farther onward the same Way we were to go  The Night was coming on and the Light began to be dusky which made it worse on our Side but the Noise encreasing we could easily perceive that it was the Howling and Yelling of those hellish Creatures and on a sudden we perceiv'd or Troops of Wolves one on our Left one behind us and one on our Front so that we seem'd to be surrounded with 'em however as they did not fall upon us we kept our Way forward as fast as  we could make our Horses go which the Way being very rough was only a good large Trot and in this Manner we came in View of the Entrance of a Wood through which we were to pass at the farther Side of the Plain but we were greatly surpriz'd when coming nearer the Lane or Pass we saw a confus'd Number of Wolves standing just at the Entrance  On a sudden at another opening of the Wood we heard the Noise of a Gun and looking that Way out rush'd a Horse with a Saddle and a Bridle on him flying like the Wind and sixteen or seventeen Wolves after him full Speed indeed the Horse had the Heels of them but as we suppos'd that he could not hold it at that rate we doubted not but they would get up with him at last and no question but they did  But here we had a most horrible Sight for riding up to the Entrance where the Horse came out we found the Carcass of another Horse and of two Men devour'd by the ravenous Creatures and one of the Men was no doubt the same who we heard fir'd the Gun for there lay a Gun just by him fir'd off but as to the Man his Head and the upper Part of his Body was eaten up  This fill'd us with Horror and we knew not what Course to take but the Creatures resolv'd us soon for they gather'd about us presently in hopes of Prey and I verily believe there were three hundred of them It happen'd very much to our Advantage that at the Entrance into the Wood but a little Way from it there lay some large Timber Trees which had been cut down the Summer before and I suppose lay there for Carriage I drew my little Troop in among those Trees and placing our selves in a Line behind one long Tree I advis'd them all to light and keeping that Tree before  us for a Breast Work to stand in a Triangle or three Fronts enclosing our Horses in the Center  We did so and it was well we did for never was a more furious Charge than the Creatures made upon us in the Place they came on us with a growling kind of a Noise and mounted the Piece of Timber which as I said was our Breast Work as if they were only rushing upon their Prey and this Fury of theirs it seems was principally occasion'd by their seeing our Horses behind us which was the Prey they aim'd at I order'd our Men to fire as before every other Man and they took their Aim so sure that indeed they kill'd several of the Wolves at the first Volley but there was a Necessity to keep a continual Firing for they came on like Devils those behind pushing on those before  When we had fir'd our second Volley of our Fusees we thought they stopp'd a little and I hop'd they would have gone off but it was but a Moment for others came forward again so we fir'd two Volleys of our Pistols and I believe in these four Firings we had kill'd seventeen or eighteen of them and lam'd twice as many yet they came on again  I was loath to spend our last Shot too hastily so I call'd my Servant not my Man  Friday  for he was better employ'd for with the greatest Dexterity imaginable he had charg'd my Fusee and his own while we were engag'd but as I said I call'd my other Man and giving him a Horn of Powder I bad him lay a Train all along the Piece of Timber and let it be a large Train he did so and had but just Time to get away when the Wolves came up to it and some were got up upon it when I snapping an uncharg'd Pistol close to the Powder  set it on fire those that were upon the Timber were scorcht with it and six or seven of them fell or rather jump'd in among us with the Force and Fright of the Fire we dispatch'd these in an Instant and the rest were so frighted with the Light which the Night for it was now very near Dark made more terrible that they drew back a little  Upon which I order'd our last Pistol to be fir'd off in one Volley and after that we gave a Shout upon this the Wolves turn'd Tail and we sally'd immediately upon near twenty lame Ones who we found struggling on the Ground and fell a cutting them with our Swords which answer'd our Expectation for the Crying and Howling they made was better understood by their Fellows so that they all fled and left us  We had first and last kill'd about three Score of them and had it been DayLight we had kill'd many more The Field of Battle being thus clear'd we made forward again for we had still near a League to go We heard the ravenous Creatures houl and yell in the Woods as we went several Times and sometimes we fancy'd we saw some of them but the Snow dazling our Eyes we were not certain so in about an Hour more we came to the Town where we were to lodge which we found in a terrible Fright and all in Arms for it seems that the Night before the Wolves and some Bears had broke into the Village in the Night and put them in a terrible Fright and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and Day but especially in the Night to preserve their Cattle and indeed their People  The next Morning our Guide was so ill and his Limbs swell'd with the rankling of his two Wounds that he could go no farther so we were oblig'd to  take a new Guide there and go to  Tholouse  where we found a warm Climate a fruitful pleasant Country and no Snow no Wolves or any Thing like them but when we told our Story at  Tholouse  they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great Forest at the Foot of the Mountains especially when the Snow lay on the Ground But they enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had gotten that would venture to bring us that Way in such a severe Season and told us it was very much we were not all devour'd When we told them how we plac'd our selves and the Horses in the Middle they blam'd us exceedingly and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroy'd for it was the Sight of the Horses which made the Wolves so furious seeing their Prey and that at other Times they are really afraid of a Gun but the being excessive Hungry and raging on that Account the Eagerness to come at the Horses had made them sensless of Danger and that if we had not by the continu'd Fire and at last by the Stratagem of the Train of Powder master'd them it had been great Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces whereas had we been content to have sat still on Horseback and fir'd as Horsemen they would not have taken the Horses for so much their own when Men were on their Backs as otherwise and withal they told us that at last if we had stood altogether and left our Horses they would have been so eager to have devour'd them that we might have come off safe especially having our Fire Arms in our Hands and being so many in Number  For my Part I was never so sensible of Danger in my Life for seeing above three hundred Devils come roaring and open mouth'd to devour us and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to I gave my self over for lost and as it was I believe I  shall never care to cross those Mountains again I think I would much rather go a thousand Leagues by Sea though I were sure to meet with a Storm once a Week  I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of in my Passage through  France  nothing but what other Travellers have given an Account of with much more Advantage than I can I travell'd from  Bourdeaux  to  Paris  and without any considerable Stay came to  Callais  and landed safe at  Dover  the fourteenth of  January  after having had a severely cold Season to travel in  I was now come to the Center of my Travels and had in a little Time all my new discover'd Estate safe about me the Bills of Exchange which I brought with me having been very currently paid  My principal Guide and Privy Councellor was my good antient Widow who in Gratitude for the Money I had sent her thought no Pains too much or Care too great to employ for me and I trusted her so entirely with every Thing that I was perfectly easy as to the Security of my Effects and indeed I was very happy from my Beginning and now to the End in the unspotted Integrity of this good Gentlewoman  And now I began to think of leaving my Effects with this Woman and setting out for  Lisbon  and so to the  Brasils  but now another Scruple came in my Way and that was Religion for as I had entertain'd some Doubts about the  Roman  Religion even while I was abroad especially in my State of Solitude so I knew there was no going to the  Brasils  for me much less going to settle there unless I resolv'd to embrace the  Roman  Catholick Religion without any Reserve unless on the other hand I resolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Principles be a Martyr for Religion and die in the Inquisition so  I resolv'd to stay at Home and if I could find Means for it to dispose of my Plantation  To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at  Lisbon  who in Return gave me Notice that he could easily dispose of it there But that if I thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my Name to the two Merchants the Survivors of my Trustees who liv'd in the  Brasils  who must fully understand the Value of it who liv'd just upon the Spot and who I knew were very rich so that he believ'd they would be fond of buying it he did not doubt but I should make or Pieces of Eight the more of it  Accordingly I agreed gave him Order to offer it to them and he did so and in about Months more the Ship being then return'd he sent me Account that they had accepted the Offer and had remitted Pieces of Eight to a Correspondent of theirs at  Lisbon  to pay for it  In Return I sign'd the Instrument of Sale in the Form which they sent from  Lisbon  and sent it to my old Man who sent me Bills of Exchange for Pieces of Eight to me for the Estate reserving the Payment of Moidores a Year to him the old Man during his Life and Moidores afterwards to his Son for his Life which I had promised them which the Plantation was to make good as a RentCharge And thus I have given the first Part of a Life of Fortune and Adventure a Life of Providences ChecquerWork and of a Variety which the World will seldom be able to show the like of Beginning foolishly but closing much more happily than any Part of it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for  Any one would think that in this State of complicated good Fortune I was past running any more Hazards and so indeed I had been if other  Circumstances had concurr'd but I was inur'd to a wandring Life had no Family not many Relations nor however rich had I contracted much Acquaintance and though I had sold my Estate in the  Brasils  yet I could not keep the Country out of my Head and had a great Mind to be upon the Wing again especially I could not resist the strong Inclination I had to see my Island and to know if the poor  Spaniards  were in Being there and how the Rogues I left there had used them  My true Friend the Widow earnestly diswaded me from it and so far prevail'd with me that for almost seven Years she prevented my running Abroad during which time I took my two Nephews the Children of one of my Sisters into my Care The eldest having something of his own I bred up as a Gentleman and gave him a Settlement of some Addition to his Estate after my Decease the other I put out to a Captain of a Ship and after five Years finding him a sensible bold enterprising young Fellow I put him into a good Ship and sent him to Sea And this young Fellow afterwards drew me in as old as I was to farther Adventures my self  In the mean time I in Part settled my self here for first of all I marry'd and that not either to my Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction and had three Children two Sons and one Daughter But my Wife dying and my Nephew coming Home with good Success from a Voyage to  Spain  my Inclination to go Abroad and his Importunity prevailed and engag'd me to go in his Ship as a private Trader to the  East Indies  This was in the Year  In this Voyage I visited my new Collony in the Island saw my Successors the  Spaniards  had the whole Story of their Lives and of the Villains I left there how at first they insulted the poor  Spaniards    how they afterwards agreed disagreed united separated and how at last the  Spaniards  were oblig'd to use Violence with them how they were subjected to the  Spaniards  how honestly the  Spaniards  used them a History if it were entred into as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents as my own Part particularly also as to their Battles with the  Carribeans  who landed several times upon the Island and as to the Improvement they made upon the Island it self and how five of them made an Attempt upon the main Land and brought away eleven Men and five Women Prisoners by which at my coming I found about twenty young Children on the Island  Here I stay'd about Days left them Supplies of all necessary things and particularly of Arms Powder Shot Cloaths Tools and two Workmen which I brought from  England  with me  viz  a Carpenter and a Smith  Besides this I shar'd the Island into Parts with 'em reserv'd to my self the Property of the whole but gave them such Parts respectively as they agreed on and having settled all things with them and engaged them not to leave the Place I left them there  From thence I touch'd at the  Brasils  from whence I sent a Bark which I bought there with more People to the Island and in it besides other Supplies I sent seven Women being such as I found proper for Service or for Wives to such as would take them As to the  English  Men I promis'd them to send them some Women from  England  with a good Cargoe of Necessaries if they would apply themselves to Planting which I afterwards perform'd And the Fellows prov'd very honest and diligent after they were master'd and had their Properties set apart for them I sent them  also from the  Brasils  five Cows three of them being big with Calf some Sheep and some Hogs which when I came again were considerably encreas'd  But all these things with an Account how  Caribbees  came and invaded them and ruin'd their Plantations and how they fought with that whole Number twice and were at first defeated and three of them kill'd but at last a Storm destroying their Enemies Cannoes they famish'd or destroy'd almost all the rest and renew'd and recover'd the Possession of their Plantation and still liv'd upon the Island  All these things with some very surprizing Incidents in some new Adventures of my own for ten Years more I may perhaps give a farther Account of hereafter  FINIS  ERRATA  PAge Line for read Ibid l f  which    to which  p the last l but one f  Wretch  r  hardned Wretch  ib f  the hardned Danger
