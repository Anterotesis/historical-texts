 VOL III  By Captain  William Dampier  LONDON  Printed for  James Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's Churchyard  To the Right Honourable THOMAS Earl of  Pembroke  Lord President of Her Maje∣sty's Most Honourable Privy Council  c  My Lord  THE Honour I had of being employ'd in the Ser∣vice of His late Majesty  f Illustrious Memory at the  me when Your Lordship presi∣  ed at the Admiralty gives me  the Boldness to ask Your Prote∣ction of the following Papers They consist of some Remarks made upon very distant Climates which I should have the vanity to think altogether new cou'd I persuade my self they had escap'd Your Lordship's Knowledge However I have been so cautious of publishing any thing in my whole Book that is generally known that I have deny'd my self the pleasure of paying the due Honours to Your Lordships Name in the Dedication I am asham'd my Lord to offer You so imperfect a Present having not time to set down all the Me∣moirs of my last Voyage But as the particular Service I have now undertaken hinders me from fi∣nishing  this Volume so I hope it will give me an opportunity of paying my Respects to Your Lord∣ship in a new one  The World is apt to judge of every thing by the Success and whoever has ill Fortune will hardly be allow'd a good Name This my Lord was my Ʋnhap∣piness in my late Expedition in the  RoeBuck  which founder'd thro' perfect Age near the Island of  Ascension  I suffer'd extreamly in my Reputation by that Misfortune tho' I comfort my self with the Thoughts that my Enemies cou'd not charge any Neglect upon me And since I have the Honour to be acquitted by Your Lordship's Judgment I shou'd be very humble not to value  my self upon so compleat a Vindi∣cation This and a World of other Favours which I have been so happy as to receive from Your Lordship's Goodness do en∣gage me to be with an everlasting Respect  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most Faithful and Obedient Servant  Will Dampier  THE PREFACE  THE favourable Reception my two former Volumes of  Voyages and Descriptions  have already met with in the World gives me Reason to hope That notwith∣standing the Objections which have been raised against me by preju∣diced Persons this  Third Volume  likewise may in some measure be acceptable to Candid and Impar∣tial Readers who are curious to know the Nature of the Inhabi∣tants Animals Plants Soil  c  in those distant Countries which have either seldom or not at all been visited by any  Europeans  It has almost always been the Fate of those who have made new Discoveries to be disesteemed and slightly spoken of by such as ei∣ther have had no true Relish and Value for the  Things themselves  that are discovered or have had some Prejudice against  the Persons  by whom the Discoveries were made It would be vain therefore and un∣reasonable in me to expect to es∣cape the Censure of all or to hope for better Treatment than far Worthier Persons have met with before me But this Satisfaction I am sure of having that the  Things themselves  in the Discovery of which I have been imployed are most worthy of our Diligentest Search and Inquiry being the various and wonderful Works of God in different Parts of the World And however  unfit a Per∣son  I may be in other respects to have undertaken this Task yet at least I have given a faithful Ac∣count  and have found  some  Things undiscovered by any before and which may at least be  some  Assist∣tance and Direction to better qua∣lified Persons who shall come after me  It has been Objected against me by some that my Accounts and Descriptions of Things are dry and jejune not filled with variety of pleasant Matter to divert and gra∣tify the Curious Reader How far this is true I must leave to the World to judge But if I have been exactly and strictly careful to give only  True  Relations and De∣scriptions of Things as I am sure I have and if my Descriptions be such as may be of use not only to my self which I have already in good measure experienced but also to others in future Voyages and likewise to such Readers at home as are more desirous of a Plain and Just Account of the true Nature and State of the Things  described than of a Polite and Rhetorical Narrative I hope all the Defects in my Stile will meet with an easy and ready Pardon  Others have taxed me with bor∣rowing from other Men's Journals and with Insufficiency as if I was not my self the Author of what I write but published Things di∣gested and drawn up by others As to the first Part of this Obje∣ction I assure the Reader I have taken nothing from any Man without mentioning his Name ex∣cept some very few Relations and particular Observations received from credible Persons who desired not to be named and these I have always expresly distinguished in my Books from what I relate as of my own observing And as to the latter I think it so far from being a Diminution to one of my Education and Employment to have what I write Revised and Corrected by Friends that on the  contrary the best and most emi∣nent Authors are not ashamed to own the same Thing and look upon it as an Advantage  Lastly I know there are some who are apt to slight my Accounts and Descriptions of Things as if it was an easie Matter and of little or no Difficulty to do all that I have done to visit little more than the Coasts of unknown Countries and make short and imperfect Ob∣servations of Things only near the Shore But whoever is experien∣ced in these Matters or considers Things impartially will be of a very different Opinion And any one who is sensible how back∣ward and refractory the Seamen are apt to be in long Voyages when they know not whither they are going how ignorant they are of the Nature of the Winds and the shifting Seasons of the Mon∣soons and how little even the Of∣ficers themselves generally are  skilled in the Variation of the Needle and the Use of the Azi∣muth Compass besides the Ha∣zard of all outward Accidents in strange and unknown Seas Any one I say who is sensible of these Difficulties will be much more pleased at the Discoveries and Ob∣servations I have been able to make than displeased with me that I did not make more  Thus much I thought necessary to premise in my own Vindica∣tion against the Objections that have been made to my former Per∣formances But not to trouble the Reader any further with Matters of this Nature what I have more to Offer shall be only in relation to the following Voyage  For the better apprehending the Course of this Voyage and the Situation of the Places mentioned in it I have here as in the former Volumes caused a Map to be In∣graven with a prick'd Line re∣presenting  to the Eye the whole Thread of the Voyage at one View besides Draughts and Fi∣gures of particular Places to make the Descriptions I have given of them more intelligible and use∣ful  Moreover which I had not the opportunity of doing in my for∣mer Voyages having now had in the Ship with me a Person skill'd in Drawing I have by this means been enabled for the great∣er Satisfaction of the Curious Rea∣der to present him with exact Cuts and Figures of several of the principal and most remarkable of those Birds Beasts Fishes and Plants which are described in the following Narrative and also of several which not being able to give any better or so good an Ac∣count of as by causing them to be exactly Ingraven the Reader will not find any further Description of them but only that they were  found in such or such particular Countries The Plants themselves are in the Hands of the Ingenious Dr  Woodward  I could have caused ma∣ny others to be drawn in like man∣ner but that I resolved to confine my Self to such only as had some very remarkable difference in the shape of their principal Parts from any that are found in  Europe  I have besides several Birds and Fishes ready drawn which I could not put into the present Vo∣lume because they were found in Countries to the Description whereof the following Narrative does not reach For being obli∣ged to prepare for another Voy∣age sooner than I at first expect∣ed I have not been able to Con∣tinue the ensuing Narrative any further than to my Departure from the Coast of  New Holland  But if it please God that I return again safe the Reader may expect a Continuation of this Voyage from  my departure from  New Holland  till the foundring of my Ship near the Island of  Ascension  In the mean time to make the Narrative in some measure com∣pleat I shall here add a Summary Abstract of that latter part of the Voyage whereof I have not had time to draw out of my Journals a full and particular Account at large Departing therefore from the Coast of  New Holland  in the be∣ginning of  September  for the Reasons mentioned  Page  we arrived at  Tymor Sept  and Anchored off that Island On the th we obtain'd a small Supply of fresh Water from the Governor of a  Dutch  Fort and Factory there we found also there a  Portuguese  Settlement and were kindly treated by them On the d of  December  we arrived on the Coast of  New Guinea  where we found good fresh Water and had Com∣merce with the Inhabitants of a  certain Island call'd  PuloSabuti  After which passing to the North∣ward we ranged along the Coast to the Eastermost part of  New Guinea  which I found does not join to the main Land of  NewGuinea  but is an Island as I have described it in my Map and call'd it  New Britain  It is probable this Island may afford many rich Commodities and the Natives may be easily brought to Commerce But the many Difficulties I at this time met with the want of convenience to clean my Ship the fewness of my Men their desire to hasten home and the danger of continu∣ing in these Circumstances in Seas where the Shoals and Coasts were utterly unknown and must be searched out with much Caution and length of time hindred me from prosecuting any further at present my intended Search What I have been able to do in this Mat∣ter  for the Publick Service will I hope be candidly receiv'd and no Difficulties shall discourage me from endeavouring to promote the same End whenever I have an op∣portunity put into my Hands  May  in our return we ar∣rived again at  Tymor June  we past by part of the Island  Java July  we anchored in  Batavia  Road and I went ashore visited the  Dutch  General and desired the Privilege of buying Provisions that I wanted which was granted me In this Road we lay till the th of  October  following when hav∣ing fitted the Ship recruited my Self with Provisions filled all my Water and the Season of the year for returning towards  Europe  being come I set Sail from  Batavia  and on the th of  December  made the Cape of  Good Hope  whence de∣parting  Jan  we made the Island of  Santa Hellena  on the st and  February  the st the Island  of  Aseension  near to which my Ship having sprung a Leak which could not be stopped foundred at Sea With much difficulty we got ashore where we liv'd on Goats and Turtle and on the th of  February  found to our great Com∣fort on the S E side of a high Mountain about half a mile from its top a Spring of fresh Water I returned to  England  in the  Can∣terbury EastIndia  Ship For which wonderful Deliverance from so many and great Dangers I think my self bound to return continual Thanks to Almighty God whose Divine Providence if it shall please to bring me safe again to my Na∣tive Country from my present in∣tended Voyage I hope to pub∣lish a particular Account of all the material Things I observed in the several Places which I have now but

carrying but Guns in this Voyage and Men and Boys with Month's Provision We had several of the King's Ships in Company bound for  Spithead  and  Plimouth  and by Noon we were off  Dungeness  We parted from them that Night and stood down the Channel but found our Selves next Morning nearer the  French  Coast than we expected C  de Hague  bearing S E and by E L There were many other Ships some nearer some further off the  French  Coast who all  seem'd to have gone nearer to it than they thought they should My Master who was somewhat troubled at it at first was not dis∣pleas'd however to find that he had Company in his Mistake Which as I have heard is a very common one and fatal to many Ships The Occasion of it is the not allowing for the Change of the Variation since the making of the Charts which Captain  Halley  has observ'd to be very considerable I shall refer the Reader to his own Account of it which he caus'd to be Publish'd in a single Sheet of Paper purposely for a Caution to such as pass to and fro the  English  Channel The Ti∣tle of it is in the Margin  An Ad∣vertise∣ment ne∣cessary to be observ'd in the Na∣vigation up and down the Channel of  England Sold by  S Smith  at the  Prince's Arms  in St  Paul  's Church∣yard Price  d  And my own Ex∣perience thus confirming to me the Usefulness of such a Caution I was willing to take this occasion of helping towards the making it the more Publick  Not to trouble the Reader with every Days Run nor with the Winds or Weather but only in the remoter Parts where it may be more particularly useful standing away from C  la Hague  we made the  Start  about that Afternoon which being the last Land we saw of  England  we reckon'd our Depar∣ture from thence Tho' we had rather have taken it from the  Lizard  if the hazy Wea∣ther would have suffer'd us to have seen it  The first Land we saw after we were out of the Channel was C  Finisterre  which we made on the th and on the th made  Lancerota  one of the  Canary  Islands of which and of  Allegrance  another of them I have here given the  Sights  as they both appeared to us at two several Bearings and Distances Table I N  o    We were now standing away for the Island  Teneriffe  where I intended to take in some Wine and Brandy for my Voyage On  Sun∣day  half an hour past in the Afternoon we made the Island and crouded in with all our Sails till when the N E Point of the Isle bore W S W dist Leagues But being then so far off that I could not expect to get in before Night I lay by till next Morning deliberating whether I should put in at  Santa Cruz  or at  Oratavia  the one on the E the other on the W side of the Island which lies mostly North and South and these are the principal Ports on each Side I chose  Santa Cruz  as the better Harbour especially at this time of the Year and as best furnish'd with that sort of Wine which I had occasion to take in for my Voyage So there I come to an Anchor  Jan  th in Fathomwa∣ter black slimy Ground about half a Mile from the Shore from which distance I took the Sight of the Town Table I N  o    In this Road Ships must ride in or Fathomwater not above half a mile from the Shore at sarthest And if there are many Ships they must ride close one by another The Shore is generally high Land and in most Places steep to This Road lies so open  depictions of the Canary Islands  Table I  Canary Islands  N  o    I Allegrance  dist about Leagues at these Bearings  I Lancerota  Shews thus at y  e  same time dist about L at these Bear̄  N  o    I Allegrance  dist about Leagues at the Bearings  I Lancerota  Shews thus at y  e  same time dist about L  The Sight of Lancerota continued  N  o    I Teneriffe  to the East that Winds from that side make a great Swell and very bad going ashore in Boats The Ships that ride here are then of∣ten forced to put to Sea and sometimes to cut or slip their Anchors not being able to weigh them The best and smoothest Land∣ing is in a small sandy Cove about a mile to the N E of the Road where there is good Water with which Ships that lade here are supply'd and many times Ships that lade at  Oratavia  which is the chief Port for Trade send their Boats hither for Water That is a worse Port for Westerly than this is for East∣erly Winds and then all Ships that are there put to Sea Between this Wateringplace and  Santa Cruz  are two little Forts which with some Batteries scatter'd along the Coast command the Road  Santa Cruz  its self is a small unwalled Town fronting the Sea guarded with two other Forts to secure the Road There are about Houses in the Town all Stories high strongly built with Stone and covered with Pantile It hath two Convents and one Church which are the best Buildings in the Town The Forts here could not secure the  Spanish  Galle∣ons from Admiral  Blake  tho' they hall'd in close under the main Fort Many of the In∣habitants that are now living remember that Action in which the  English  batter'd the Town and did it much Damage and the marks of the Shot still remain in the FortWalls The Wrecks of the Galleons that  were burnt here lie in Fathomwater And 'tis said that most of the Plate lies there tho' some of it was hastily carried ashore at  Blake  's coming in sight  Soon after I had anchor'd I went ashore here to the Governor of the Town who re∣ceived me very kindly and invited me to Dine with him the next day I return'd on board in the Evening and went ashore again with two of my Officers the next Morning hoping to get up the Hill time enough to see  Laguna  the principal Town and to be back again to Dine with the Governor of  Santa Cruz  for I was told that  Laguna  was but Mile off The Road is all the way up a pret∣ty steep Hill yet not so steep but that Carts go up and down laden There are Publick Houses scattering by the wayside where we got some Wine The Land on each side seemed to be but rocky and dry yet in many Places we saw Spots of green flourishing Corn At farther distances there were small Vineyards by the Sides of the Mountains in∣termixt with abundance of waste rocky Land unfit for Cultivation which afforded only Dildobushes It was about or in the Morning when we set out from  Santa Cruz  and it being fair clear Weather the Sun shone very bright and warmed us sufficiently be∣fore we got to the City  Laguna  which we reached about a Clock all sweaty and tired and were glad to refresh our selves with a little Wine in a sorry Tiplinghouse  But we soon found out one of the  English  Merchants that resided here who enter∣tain'd us handsomly at Dinner and in the Afternoon shew'd us the Town  Laguna  is a pretty large wellcompacted Town and makes a very agreeable Prospect It stands part of it against a Hill and part in a Level The Houses have mostly strong Walls built with Stone and covered with Pantile They are not uniform yet they appear pleasant enough There are many fair Buildings among which are ParishChurches Nunneries an Hospital Con∣vents and some Chapels besides many Gentlemen's Houses The Convents are those of St  Austin  St  Dominick  St  Francis  and St  Diego  The two Churches have pret∣ty high square Steeples which top the rest of the Buildings The Streets are not Regular yet they are mostly spacious and pretty hand∣some and near the middle of the Town is a large Parade which has good Buildings about it There is a strong Prison on one side of it near which is a large Conduit of good Water that supplies all the Town They have many Gardens which are set round with Oranges Limes and other Fruits In the middle of which are Potherbs Sallading Flowers  c  And indeed if the Inhabi∣tants were curious this way they might have very pleasant Gardens For as the Town stands high from the Sea on the Brow of a Plain that is all open to the East and  hath consequently the Benefit of the true Tradewind which blows here and is most commonly fair so there are seldom wanting at this Town brisk cooling and refreshing Breezes all the Day  On the back of the Town there is a large Plain of or Leagues in length and Miles wide producing a thick kindly sort of Grass which look'd green and very pleasant when I was there like our Meadows in  England  in the Spring On the Eastside of this Plain very near the back of the Town there is a natural Lake or Pond of fresh Water It is about half a Mile in circumference but be∣ing stagnant 'tis only us'd for Cattle to drink of In the Wintertime several sorts of wild Fowl resort hither affording plenty of Game to the Inhabitants of  Laguna  This City is called  Laguna  from hence for that Word in  Spanish  signifies a Lake or Pond The Plain is bounded on the W the N W and the S W with high steep Hills as high above this Plain as this is above the Sea and 'tis from the foot of one of these Mountains that the Water of the Conduit which supplies the Town is conveyed over the Plain in Troughs of Stone rais'd upon Pillars And indeed considering the Situation of the Town its large Prospect to the East for from hence you see the  Grand Canary  its Gardens cool Arbors pleasant Plain green Fields the Pond and Aqueduct and its refreshing Breezes it is a very delightful Dwelling  especially for such as have not Business that calls them far and often from home For the Island being generally Mountainous steep and craggy full of Risings and Fallings 'tis very troublesome Travelling up and down in it unless in the Cool of the Mornings and Evenings And Mules and Asses are most us'd by them both for Riding and Carriage as fittest for the stony uneven Roads  Beyond the Mountains on the S W side still further up you may see from the Town and Plain a small peeked Hill overlooking the rest This is that which is called the  Pike of Teneriffe    so much noted for its heighth But we saw it here at so great a disadvantage by reason of the nearness of the adjacent Mountains to us that it looked in∣considerable in respect to its Fame  The true  Malmesy  Wine grows in this Island and this here is said to be the best of its kind in the World Here is also  Canary  Wine and  Verdona  or Greenwine The  Canary  grows chiefly on the Westside of the Island and therefore is commonly sent to  Oratavia  which being the chief Seaport for Trade in the Island the principal  English  Merchants reside there with their Consul because we have a great Trade for this Wine I was told That that Town is bigger than  Laguna  that it has but one Church but ma∣ny Convents That the Port is but ordinary at best and is very bad when the N W Winds blow These Norwesters give no∣tice  of their coming by a great Sea that tumbles in on the Shore for some time before they come and by a black Sky in the N W Upon these Signs Ships either get up their Anchors or slip their Cables and put to Sea and ply off and on till the Weather is over Sometimes they are forced to do so or times before they can take in their Lad∣ing which 'tis hard to do here in the fairest Weather And for fresh Water they send as I have said to  Santa Cruz Verdona  is green strongbodied Wine harsher and sharper than  Canary  'Tis not so much e∣steemed in  Europe  but is exported to the  WestIndies  and will keep best in hot Countries for which Reason I touch'd here to take in some of it for my Voyage This sort of Wine is made chiefly on the Eastside of the Island and Shipt off at  Santa Cruz  Besides these Wines which are yearly vended in great plenty from the  Canary  Islands chiefly from  Grand Canary Teneriffe  and  Palma  here is store of Grain as Wheat Bar∣ly and Maiz which they often transport to other places They have also some Beans and Peas and Coches a sort of Grain much like Maiz sow'd mostly to satten Land They have Papah's which I shall speak more of hereafter Apples Pears Plumbs Cherries and excellent Peaches Apricocks Guava's Pomegranates Citrons Oranges Lemons Limes Pumpkins Onions the best in the World Cabbages Turnips Potato's  c  They are also well stocked with Horses Cows Asses Mules Sheep Goats Hogs Conies and plenty of Deer The  Lancerot  Horses are said to be the most mettlesome fleet and loyal Horses that are Lastly here are many Fowls as Cocks and Hens Ducks Pidgeons Patridges  c  with plenty of Fish as Mackril  c  All the  Canary  Islands have of these Commodities and Provisions more or less But as  Lancerota  is most fam'd for Hor∣ses and  Grand Canary Teneriffe  and  Palma  for Wines  Teneriffe  especially for the best Malmesy for which reason these Islands have the chief Trade so is  Forteventura  for DunghilFowls and  Gomera  for Deer Fowls and other Eatables are dear on the Trading Islands but very plentiful and cheap on the other and therefore 'tis best for such Ships as are going out on long Voyages and who design to take in but little Wine to touch rather at these last where also they may be supply'd with Wine enough and good cheap And for my own part if I had known it before I came hither I should have gone rather to one of those Islands than to  Teneriffe  But enough of this  'Tis reported they can raise armed Men on this Island The Governor or  Gene∣ral  as he is call'd of all the  Canary  Islands lives at  Laguna  His Name is  Don Pedro de Ponto  He is a Native of this Island and was not long since President of  Panama  in the  South Seas  who bringing some very rich  Pearls from thence which he presented to the Queen of  Spain  was therefore as 'tis said made General of the  Canary  Islands The  Grand Canary  is an Island much superior to  Teneriffe  both in Bulk and Value but this Gentleman chuses rather to reside in this his native Island He has the Character of a ve∣ry worthy Person and governs with Mode∣ration and Justice being very well be∣loved  One of his Deputies was the Governor of  Santa Cruz  with whom I was to have Din'd but staying so long at  Laguna  I came but time enough to Sup with him He is a civil discreet Man He resides in the main Fort close by the Sea There is a Centinel stands at his Door and he has a few Ser∣vants to wait on him I was Treated in a large dark Lower Room which has but one small Window There were about Mus∣kets hung up against the Walls and some Pikes no Wainscot Hangings nor much Furniture There was only a small old Table a few old Chairs and or pretty long Forms to sit on Having Supp'd with him I invited him on Board and went off in my Boat The next Morning he came aboard with another Gentleman in his Company attended by Servants But he was present∣ly Seasick and so much out of order that he could scarce Eat or Drink any Thing but went quickly ashore again  Having refresh'd my Men ashore and ta∣ken in what we had occasion for I Sail'd a∣way from  Santa Cruz  on  Feb  in the After∣noon hastening out all I could because the N E Winds growing stormy made so great Sea that the Ship was scarce safe in the Road and I was glad to get out tho' we left behind several Goods we had bought and paid for For a Boat could not go ashore and the stress was so great in weighing Anchor that the Cable broke I design'd next for the I of  Mayo  one of the  C Verd  Islands and ran away with a strong N E Wind right afore it all that Night and the next Day at the rate of or Miles an hour when it slacken'd to a more moderate Gale The  Ca∣nary  Islands are for their Latitude within the usual Verge of the True or General TradeWind which I have observ'd to be on this side the Equator N Easterly But then lying not far from the  African  Shore they are most subject to a N Wind which is the  Coasting and constant Trade  sweeping that Coast down as low as to C  Verd  which spreading in breadth takes in mostly the  Ca∣nary  Islands tho' it be there interrupted fre∣quently with the True TradeWind N WestWinds or other Shifts of Wind that Islands are Subject to especially where they lie many together The  Pike  of  Teneriffe  which had generally been Clouded while we lay at  Santa Cruz  appear'd now all white with Snow hovering over the other Hills  but their heighth made it seem the less consi∣derable for it looks most remarkable to Ships that are to the Westward of it We had brisk N N E and N E Winds from  Tene∣riffe  and saw Flyingfish and a great deal of Seathistle Weed floating By the th of  Feb  at Noon we were in the Lat of d m so we steered away W N W for the I of  Mayo  being by Judgment not far to the E of it and at a Clock in the Evening lay by till Day The Wind was then at W by S and so it continued all Night fair Weather and a small easie Gale All these were great Signs that we were near some Land after having had such constant brisk Winds before In the Morning after Sun∣rise we saw the Island at about Leagues distance But it was so hazy over it that we could see but a small part of it yet even by that part I knew it to be the Isle of  Mayo  See how it appear'd to us at several  Views  as we were compassing the E the S E and the S of it to get to the Road on the S W of it Table II N  o  and the Road it self N  o    I got not in till the next Day  Feb  when I come to an Anchor in the Road which is the Leeward part of the Island for 'tis a general Rule never to Anchor to Windward of an Island between the Tro∣picks We Anchored at a

and Towne of  S  t  Iago  Shore in the same Place where I Anchor'd in my  Voyage round the World  and found rid∣ing here the  Newport of London  a Merchant Man Captain  Barefoot  Commander who welcomed me with Guns and I returned one for Thanks He came from  Fayal  one of the  Western  Islands and had store of Wine and Brandy aboard He was taking in Salt to carry to  NewfoundLand  and was very glad to see one of the King's Ships being before our coming afraid of Pyrates which of late Years had much infested this and the rest of the Cape  Verd Islands  I have given some Account of the Island of  Mayo  and of other of these Islands in my  Voyage round the World  Vol I p but I shall now add some further Observations that occurr'd to me in this Voyage The I of  Mayo  is about Leagues in Circumference of a roundish Form with many small rocky Points shooting out into the Sea a Mile or more Its Lat is d N and as you Sail about the Isle when you come pretty nigh the Shore you will see the Water breaking off from those Points which you must give a Birth to and avoid them I Sail'd at this time two parts in three round the Island but saw nothing dangerous besides these Points and they all shew'd themselves by the Break∣ing of the Water Yet 'tis reported That on the N and N N W side there are dan∣gerous Sholes that ly farther off at Sea but I was not on that Side There are Hills  on this Island of a considerable heighth one pretty bluff the other peeked at top The rest of the Island is pretty level and of a good heighth from the Sea The Shore clear round hath sandy Bays between the Rocky Points I spake of and the whole Island is a very dry sort of Soil  On the Westside of the Isle where the Road for Ships is there is a large Sandy Bay and a Sandbank of about Paces wide within it which runs along the Shore or Miles within which there is a large  Salina  or Saltpond contained between the Sandbank and the Hills beyond it The whole  Salina  is about Miles in length and half a Mile wide but above one half of it is com∣monly dry The North end only of the Pond never wants Water producing Salt from  No∣vember  till  May  which is here the dry Season of the Year The Water which yields this Salt works in from out of the Sea through a hole in the Sandbank before mentioned like a Sluce and that only in Springtides when it fills the Pond more or less according to the heighth of the Tides If there is any Salt in the Ponds when the Flush of Water comes in it presently dissolves But then in two or three Days after it begins to Kern and so continues Kerning till either all or the great∣est part of the Saltwater is congeal'd or kern'd or till a fresh Supply of it comes in again from the Sea This Water is known to come in only at that one Passage on the N  part of the Pond where also it is deepest It was at a Spring of the  New  Moon when I was there and I was told that it comes in at no other time but at the New Moon Springtides but why that should be I can't guess They who come hither to lade Salt rake it up as it Kerns and lay it in heaps on the dry Land before the Wa∣ter breaks in anew And this is observable of this SaltPond that the Salt kerns only in the Dry Season contrary to the SaltPonds in the  WestIndies  particularly those of the Island  SaltTortuga  which I have formerly mentioned Vol I p for they never Kern there till the Rains come in about  April  and continue to do so in  May June July  c while the Wet Sea∣son lasts and not without some good Shower of Rain first But the Reason al∣so of this Difference between the SaltPonds of  Mayo  and those of the  WestIndies  why these should Kern in the Wet Season and the former in the Dry S  on I shall leave to Philosophers  Our Nation drive here a great Trade for Salt and have commonly a Man of War here for the Guard of our Ships and Barks that come to take it in of which I have been inform'd that in some Years there have not been less than in a Year It costs nothing but Men's Labour to rake it together and wheel it out of the Pond  except the Carriage And that also is very cheap the Inhabitants having plenty of Asses for which they have little to do be∣sides carrying the Salt from the Ponds to the Seatide at the Season when Ships are here The Inhabitants lade and drive their Asses themselves being very glad to be imploy'd for they have scarce any o∣ther Trade but this to get a Penny by The Pond is not above half a Mile from the Landingplace so that the Asses make a great many Trips in a day They have a set number of Turns to and fro both Forenoon and Afternoon which their Owners will not exceed At the Landingplace there lies a  Frape  boat as our Seamen call it to take in the  Salt  'Tis made purposely for this use with a Deck reaching from the Stern a third part of the Boat where there is a kind of Bulkhead that rises not from the Boats bottom but from the Edge of the Deck to about foot in heighth all calk'd very tight The Use of it is to keep the Waves from dashing into the Boat when it lies with its Head to the Shore to take in Salt For here commonly runs a great Sea and when the Boat lies so with its Head to the Shore the Sea breaks in over the Stern and would soon fill it was it not for this Bulkhead which stops the Waves that come flowing upon the Deck  and makes them run off into the Sea on each side To keep the Boat thus with the Head to the Shore and the Stern to the Sea there are two strong Stantions set up in the Boat the one at the Head the o∣ther in the middle of it against the Bulkhead and a Foot higher than the Bulkhead There is a large Notch cut in the top of each of these Stantions big enough for a small Hazer or Rope to lie in one end of which is fasten'd to a Post ashore and the other to a Grapling or An∣chor lying a pretty way off at Sea This Rope serveth to hale the Boat in and out and the Stantions serve to keep her fast so that she cannot swing to either side when the Rope is hal'd tight For the Sea would else fill her or toss her ashore and stave her The better to prevent her staving and to keep her the tighter together there are two sets of Ropes more The first go∣ing athwart from Gunnal to Gunnal which when the Rowers Benches are laid bind the Boats sides so hard against the Ends of the Benches that they cannot easily fall asunder while the Benches and Ropes mutually help each other the Ropes keeping the Boats sides from flying off and the Benches from being crush'd together inwards Of these Ropes there are usual∣ly but two dividing the Boats length as they go across the Sides into there equal  parts The other set of Ropes are more in number and are so plac'd as to keep the Ribs and Planks of the Boat from starting off For this purpose there are holes made at certain distances through the Edge of the Keel that runs along on the inside of the Boat through which these Ropes pas∣sing are laid along the Ribs so as to line them or be themselves as Ribs upon them being made fast to them by Rattan's brought thither or small Cords twisted close about both Ropes and Ribs up to the Gunnal By which means tho' several of the Nails or Pegs of the Boat should by any shock fall out yet the Ropes of these two sets might hold her together Espe∣cially with the help of a Rope going quite round about the Gunnal on the outside as our Longboats have And such is the Care taken to strengthen the Boats from which girding them with Ropes which our Seamen call  Fraping  they have the Name of Frapeboats Two Men suffice to hale her in and out and take in the Salt from Shore which is brought in Bags and put it out again As soon as the Boat is brought nigh enough to the Shore he who stands by the Bulkhead takes instantly a turn with the Hazer about the BulkheadStantion and that stops her fast before the Sea can turn her aside And when the two Men have got in their Lad∣ing  they hale off to Sea till they come a little without the swell where they re∣move the Salt into another Boat that car∣ries it on board the Ship Without such a  Frape  boat here is but bad Landing at any time for tho' 'tis commonly very smooth in the Road yet there falls a great Sea on the Shore so that every Ship that comes here should have such a  Boat  and bring or make or borrow one of other Ships that happen to be here for the Inhabi∣tants have none I have been thus parti∣cular in the Description of these  Frape  boats because of the Use they may be of in any Places where a great Sea falls in upon the Shore as it doth especially in many open Roads in the  East  and  WestIndies  where they might therefore be very ser∣viceable but I never saw any of them there  The Island  Mayo  is generally barren be∣ing dry as I said and the best of it is but a very indifferent Soil The sandy Bank that pens in the Saltpond hath a sort of Silk Cotton growing upon it and a Plant that runs along upon the Ground branch∣ing out like a Vine but with thick broad Leaves The SilkCotton grows on ten∣der Shrubs or Foot high in Cods as big as an Apple but of a long shape which when ripe open at one end parting leisure∣ly into quarters and at the first open∣ing  the Cotton breaks forth It may be of use for stuffing of Pillows or the like but else is of no value any more than that of the great Cottontree I took of these Cods before they were quite ripe and laid them in my Chest and in two or three days they would open and throw out the Cotton Others I have bound fast with Strings so that the Cod could not open and in a few Days after as soon as I slack∣ned the String never so little the Cod would burst and the Cotton fly out force∣ably at a very little hole just as the Pulp out of a roasting Apple till all has been out of the Cod I met with this sort of Cotton afterwards at  Timor  where it was ripe in  November  and no where else in all my Travels but I found two o∣ther sorts of Silkcotton at  Brazil  which I shall there describe The right CottonShrub grows here also but not on the Sandbank I saw some Bushes of it near the Shore but the most of it is planted in the middle of the Isle where the Inhabi∣tants live Cottoncloth being their chief Manufacture but neither is there any great store of this Cotton There also are some Trees within the Island but none to be seen near the Seaside nothing but a few Bushes scattering up and down against the sides of the adjacent Hills for as I said before the Land is pretty high from  the Sea The Soil is for the most part either a sort of Sand or loose crumbling Stone without any fresh Water Ponds or Streams to moisten it but only Showers in the Wetseason which run off as fast as they fall except a small Spring in the middle of the Isle from which proceeds a little Stream of Water that runs through a Valley between the Hills There the Inhabitants live in three small Towns hav∣ing a Church and Padre in each Town And these Towns as I was inform'd are or miles from the Road  Pinose  is said to be the chief Town and to have two Churches St  Johns  the next and the third  Lagoa  The Houses are very mean small low Things They build with Figtree here being as I was told no other Trees fit to build with The Raf∣ters are a sort of wild Cane The Fruits of this Isle are chiefly Figs and WaterMelons They have also  Callavances  a sort of Pulse like  French  Beans and Pump∣kins for ordinary Food The Fowls are Flamingo's Great Curlews and  Guinea  Hens which the Natives of those Islands call  Gallena Pintada  or the Painted Hen but in  Jamaica  where I have seen also those Birds in the dry Savannah's and Woods for they love to run about in such Places they are call'd  Guinea  Hens They seem to be much of the Nature of Partridges  They are bigger than our Hens have long Legs and will run apace They can fly too but not far having large heavy Bodies and but short Wings and short Tails As I have generally observ'd that Birds have seldom long Tails unless such as fly much in which their Tails are usual∣ly serviceable to their turning about as a Rudder to a Ship or Boat These Birds have thick and strong yet sharp Bills pretty long Claws and short Tails They feed on the Ground either on Worms which they find by tearing open the Earth or on Grashoppers which are plentiful here The Feathers of these Birds are speckled with dark and light Gray the spots so regular and uniform that they look more beautiful than many Birds that are deck'd with gayer Feathers Their Necks are small and long their Heads also but little The Cocks have a small rising on their Crowns like a sort of a Comb 'Tis of the colour of a dry Wall Nutshell and very hard They have a small red Gill on each side of their Heads like Ears strutting out downwards but the Hens have none They are so strong that one cannot hold them and very hardy They are very good Meat ten∣der and sweet and in some the Flesh is extraordinary white tho' some others have black Flesh but both sorts are very  good The Natives take them with Dogs running them down whenever they please for here are abundance of them You shall see or in a company I had several brought aboard alive where they throve very well some of them or Months when they began to pine When they are taken young they will become tame like our Hens The  Flamingo  's I have already describ'd at large Vol I p They have also many other sort of Fowls  viz  Pidgeons and Turtledoves  Miniota  's a sort of Landfowls as big as Crows of a grey colour and good Food  Crusia  's another sort of greycolour'd Fowl almost as big as a Crow which are only seen in the Night probably a sort of Owls and are said to be good for con∣sumptive People but eaten by none else  Rabek  's a sort of large grey eatable Fowls with long Necks and Legs not unlike Herons and many kinds of small Bitds  Of LandAnimals here are Goats as I said formerly and Asses good store When I was here before they were said to have had a great many Bulls and Cows But the Pirates who have since miserably infested all these Islands have much lessen'd the number of those not having spar'd the Inhabitants them∣selves for at my being there this time the  Governor of  Mayo  was but newly return'd from being a Prisoner among them they having taken him away and carried him about with them for a Year or two  The Sea is plentifully stock'd with Fish of divers sorts  viz  Dolphins Boneta's Mullets Snappers Silverfish Garfish  c  and here is a good Bay to hale a Sain or Net in I hal'd mine several times and to good purpose dragging ashore at one time dozen of great Fish most of them large Mullets of a foot and a half or two foot long Here are also Porposes and a small sort of Whales that common∣ly visit this Road every day I have al∣ready said Vol I p That the Months of  May June July  and  August  that is the Wet Season are the time when the Green Turtle come hither and go ashore to lay their Eggs I look upon it as a thing worth taking Notice of that the Turtle should always both in North and South Latitude lay their Eggs in the Wet Months It might be thought con∣sidering what great Rains there are then in some places where these Creatures lay that their Eggs should be spoiled by them But the Rain tho' violent is soon soaked up by the Sand wherein the Eggs are buri∣ed and perhaps sinks not so deep into it as the Eggs are laid And keeping down the Heat may make the Sand hotter below  than it was before like a Hotbed What∣ever the Reason may be why Providence determines these Creatures to this Season of laying their Eggs rather than the Dry in Fact it is so as I have constantly ob∣serv'd and that not only with the SeaTurtle but with all other sorts of Amphi∣bious Animals that lay Eggs as Croco∣dils Alligator's Guano's  c  The In∣habitants of this Island even their Gover∣nour and  Padre  's are all Negro's Wool∣pated like their  African  Neighbours from whom 'tis like they are descended tho' being Subjects to the  Portuguese  they have their Religion and Language They are stout lusty welllimb'd People both Men and Women fat and fleshy and they and their Children as round and plump as little Porposes tho' the Island appears so barren to a Stranger as scarce to have Food for its Inhabitants I inquired how many People there might be on the Isle And was told by one of the  Padre  's that here were Souls in all The NegroGovernor has his Patent from the  Portu∣guese  Governor of St  Jago  He is a very civil and sensible poor Man and they are generally a good sort of People He ex∣pects a small Present from every Com∣mander that lades Salt here and is glad to be invited aboard their Ships He spends most of his time with the  English  in the  Salting Season which is his Harvest and indeed all the Islanders are then fully em∣ployed in getting somewhat for they have no Vessels of their own to Trade with nor do any PortugueseVessels come hither scarce any but  English  on whom they depend for Trade and tho' Subjects of  Portugal  have a particular Value for us We don't pay them for their Salt but for the Labour of themselves and their Beasts in lading it for which we give them Vi∣ctuals some Mony and old Cloaths  viz  Hats Shirts and other Cloaths by which means many of them are indifferently well rigg'd but some of them go almost Naked When the Turtleseason comes in they watch the Sandybays in the Night to turn them and having small Huts at par∣ticular Places on the Bays to keep them from the Rain and to sleep in And this is another Harvest they have for Food for by Report there come a great many Tur∣tle to this and the rest of the  Cape Verd Islands  When the Turtle Season is over they have little to do but to hunt for  Guinea  Hens and manage their small Plan∣tations But by these means they have all the Year some Employment or other whereby they get a Subsistence tho' but little else When any of them are desirous to go over to St  Jago  they get a Licence from the Governor and desire passage in  any  English  Ship that is going thither And indeed all Ships that lade Salt here will be obliged to touch at St  Jago  for Water for here at the Bay is none not so much as for Drinking 'Tis true there is a small Well of brackish Water not half a mile from the Landingplace which the Asses that carry Salt drink at but 'tis very bad Water Asses themselves are a Com∣modity in some of these Islands several of our Ships coming hither purposely to freight with them and carry them to  Barbadoes  and our other Plantations I stay'd at  Mayo  days and got or Tun of Salt aboard for my Voyage In which time there came also into this Road several Sail of Merchants Ships for Salt all bound with it for  Newfoundland  The th day of  February  at about One a Clock in the Morning I weighed from  Mayo  Road in order to Water at St  Jago  which was about or Leagues to the Westward We coasted along the Island  St Jago  and past by the Port on the East of it I mention'd formerly Vol I p which they call  Praya  where some Eng∣lish outwardbound  EastIndia  Men still touch but not so many of them as hereto∣fore We saw the Fort upon the Hill the Houses and Coconut Trees But I would not go in to anchor here because I expe∣cted better Water on the S W of the  Island at St  Jago  Town By a Clock in the Morning we saw the Ships in that Road being within Leagues of it But were forc'd to keep Turning many hours to get in the Flaws of Wind coming so uncertain as they do especially to the  Lee∣ward  of Islands that are High Land At length two  Portuguese  boats came off to help tow us in and about a Clock in the Afternoon we came to an Anchor and took the Prospect of the Town Table II N  o  We found here be∣sides two  PortugueseShips  bound for  Brazil  whose Boats had tow'd us in an  English  Pink that had taken in Asses at one of the  Cape Verd  Islands and was bound to  Barbadoes  with them Next Morning I went Ashore with my Officers to the Governor who treated us with Sweetmeats I told him the occa∣sion of my coming was chiefly for Water and that I desired also to take in some Re∣freshments of Fowls  c  He said I was welcom and that he would order the Townsmen to bring their Commodities to a certain House where I might purchase what I had occasion for I told him I had not Mony but would exchange some of the Salt which I brought from  Mayo  for their Commodities He reply'd that Salt was indeed an acceptable Commodity with the poor People but that if I design'd to  buy any Cattle I must give Mony for them I contented my self with taking in Dunghil Fowls The Governor ordering a Cryer to go about the Town and give notice to the People that they might repair to such a place with Fowls and Maiz for feeding them where they might get Salt in exchange for them So I sent on board for Salt and ordered some of my Men to truck the same for the Fowls and Maiz while the rest of them were busie in filling of Wa∣ter This is the effect of their keeping no Boats of their own on the several Islands that they are glad to buy even their own Salt of Foreigners for want of being able to transport it themselves from Island to Island  St Jago  Town lies on the S W part of the Island in Lat about Deg N and is the Seat of the General Governour and of the Bishop of all the  Cape Verd  Islands This Town stands scattering a∣gainst the sides of two Mountains be∣tween which there is a deep Valley which is about Yards wide against the Sea but within a quarter of a mile it closes up so as not to be Yards wide In the Valley by the Sea there is a stragling Street Houses on each side and a Run of Water in the bottom which empties it self into a fine small Cove or sandy Bay where the Sea is commonly very smooth  so that here is good Wat'ring and good Landing at any time tho' the Road be rocky and bad for Ships Just by the Landingplace there is a small Fort almost level with the Sea where is always a Court of Guard kept On the top of the Hill above the Town there is another Fort which by the Wall that is to be seen from the Road seems to be a large Place They have Canon mounted there but how many I know not Neither what use that Fort can be of except it be for Sa∣lutes The Town may consist of or Houses all built of rough Stone having also one Convent and one Church  The People in general are black or at least of a mixt colour except only some few of the better sort  viz  the Governor the Bishop some Gentlemen and some of the Padres for some of these also are black The People about  Praya  are Thievish but these of  St Jago  Town living under their Governour's Eye are more orderly tho' generally poor having little Trade Yet besides chance Ships of other Nations there come hither a  Portuguese  Ship or two every Year in their way to  Brazil  These vend among them a few  European  Com∣modies and take of their principal Manu∣factures  viz  striped Cottoncloth which they carry with them to  Brazil  Here is also another Ship comes hither from  Por∣tugal  for Sugar their other Manufacture and returns with it directly thither For 'tis reported that there are several small Sugarworks on this Island from which they send home near Tun every year and they have plenty of Cotton growing up in the Country wherewith they cloath themselves and send also a great deal to  Brazil  They have Vines of which they make some Wine but the  European  Ships furnish them with better tho' they drink but little of any Their chief Fruits are besides Plantains in abundance Oranges Lemons Citrons Melons both Musk and Watermelons Limes Guava's Pom∣granates Quinces CustardApples and Papah's  c  The CustardApple as we call it is a Fruit as big as a  Pomegranate  and much of the same colour The outside Husk Shell or Rind is for substance and thick∣ness between the Shell of a Pomegranate and the Peel of a  Sevil  Orange softer than this yet more brittle than that The Coat or Covering is also remarkable in that it is beset round with small regular Knobs or Risings and the inside of the Fruit is full of a white soft Pulp sweet and very pleasant and most resembling a Custard of any thing both in Colour and Tast From whence probably it is called a CustardApple by our  English  It has in the mid∣dle  a few small black Stones or Kernels but no Core for 'tis all Pulp The Tree that bears this Fruit is about the bigness of a Quincetree with long small and thick∣set Branches spread much abroad At the Extremity of here and there one of which the Fruit grows upon a Stalk of its own about or Inches long slender and tough and hanging down with its own weight A large Tree of this sort does not bear usually above or Apples sel∣dom more This Fruit grows in most Countries within the  Tropicks  I have seen of them tho' I omitted the Descri∣ption of them before all over the  WestIndies  both Continent and Islands as al∣so in  Brazil  and in the  EastIndies  The  Papah  too is found in all these Countries though I have not hitherto de∣scrib'd it It is a Fruit about the bigness of a MuskMelon hollow as that is and much resembling it in Shape and Colour both outside and inside Only in the mid∣dle instead of flat Kernels which the Me∣lons have these have a handful of small blackish Seeds about the bigness of Pep∣percorns whose Taste is also hot on the Tongue somewhat like Pepper The Fruit it self is sweet soft and luscious when ripe but while green 'tis hard and un∣favory tho' even then being boiled and eaten with Saltpork or Beef it serves in∣stead  of Turnips and is as much esteemed The PapahTree is about or Foot high The Body near the Ground may be a Foot and an half or Foot Diameter and it grows up tapering to the top It has no Branches at all but only large Leaves growing immediately upon Stalks from the Body The Leaves are of a roundish Form and jag'd about the Edges having their Stalks or Stumps longer or shorter as they grow near or further from the top They begin to spring from out of the Body of the Tree at about or Foot heighth from the Ground the Trunk being bare below but above that the Leaves grow thicker and larger still to∣wards its Top where they are close and broad The Fruit grows only among the Leaves and thickest among the thickest of them insomuch that towards the top of the Tree the  Papah  's springs forth from its Body as thick as they can stick one by another But then lower down where the Leaves are thinner the Fruit is larger and of the size I have describ'd And at the Top where they are thick they are but small and no bigger than ordinary Turnips yet tasted like the rest  Their chief LandAnimals are their Bullocks which are said to be many tho' they askt us Dollars apiece for them They have also Horses Asses and  Mules Deer Goats Hogs and black∣fac'd longtail'd Monkeys Of Fowls they have Cocks and Hens Ducks  Guinea  Hens both tame and wild Parakites Parrots Pidgeons TurtleDoves Herons Hawks Crabcatchers Galdens a larger sort of Crabcatchers Curlew's  c  Their Fish is the same as at  Mayo  and the rest of these Islands and for the most part these Islands have the same Beasts and Birds also But some of the Isles have Pasturage and Employment for some particular Beasts more than other and the Birds are in∣courag'd by Woods for shelter and Maiz and Fruits sor Food to flock rather to some of the Islands as to this of St  Jago  than to others  St  Jago  Road is one of the worst that I have been in There is not clean Ground enough for above Ships and those also must lie very near each other One even of these must lie close to the Shore with a Landfast there And that is the best for a small Ship I should not have come in here if I had not been told that it was a good secure Place but I found it so much otherways that I was in pain to be gone Captain  Baresool  who came to an An∣chor while I was here in  oul Ground lost quickly Anchors and I had lost a  small one The Island  Fogo  shews its self from this Road very plain

 C Verd  Islands I meditated on the process of my Voyage I thought it requisite to touch once more at a cultivated Place in these Seas where my Men might be refresh'd and might have a Market wherein to furnish themselves with Ne∣cessaries For designing that my next Stretch should be quite to  N Holland  and knowing that after so long a Run nothing was to be expected there but fresh Water if I could meet even with that there I re∣solved upon putting in first at some Port of  Brazil  and to provide my Self there with whatever I might have further Oc∣casion for Beside the refreshing and fur∣nishing my Men I aim'd also at the inuring them gradually and by intervals to the Fa∣tigues that were to be expected in the re∣mainder of the Voyage which was to be in a part of the World they were altogether Strangers to none of them except two young Men having ever crosst the  Line  With this Design I sail'd from  St Jago  on the d of  February  with the Winds at E N E and N E fair Weather and a brisk Gale We steered away S S E and S S E half East till in the Lat of deg min we met with many Rip∣lings in the Sea like a Tide or strong Cur∣rent which setting against the Wind caus'd such a Ripling We continu'd to meet these Currents from that Lat till we came into the Lat of deg N when they ceased During this time we saw some Boneta's and Sharks catching one of these We had the true General TradeWind blowing fresh at N E till in the Lat of deg min N when the Wind varied and we had small Gales with some Tornadoes We were then to the East of  St Jago  deg min when we got into Lat deg min N where I said the Ripling ceas'd and Long to the East of  St Jago  deg min we had the Wind whiffling between the S by E and E by N small Gales frequent Calms very black Clouds with much Rain In the Lat of deg min N and Long E from  St Jago  deg min we had the Wind from the S S E to the N N E faint and often interrupted with Calms While we had Calms we had the opportu∣nity of trying the Current we had met with hitherto and found that it set N E  by E half a Knot which is mile in hours So that here it ran at the Rate of half a mile an hour and had been much stronger before The Rains held us by intervals till the Lat of deg min N with small Gales of Wind between S S E and S E by E and sometimes calm Af∣terwards we had the Wind between the S S S E till we crosst the Line small Winds Calms and pretty fair Weather We saw but few Fish beside Porposes but of them a great many and struck one of them  It was the th day of  March  about the time of the  Equinox  when we crosst the  Equator  having had all along from the Lat of deg min N where the True TradeWind left us a great swell out of the S E and but small uncertain Gales mostly Southerly so that we crept to the Southward but slowly I kept up against these as well as I could to the Southward and when we had now and then a flurry of Wind at E I still went away due South purposely to get to the Southward as fast as I could for while near the  Line  I expe∣cted to have but uncertain Winds fre∣quent Calms Rains Tornadoes  c  which would not only retard my Course but endanger Sickness also among my Men especially those who were ill provided with Cloaths or were too lazy to shift them∣selves  when they were drench'd with the Rains The Heat of the Weather made them careless of doing this but taking a Dram of Brandy which I gave them when wet with a Charge to shift themselves they would however lie down in their Hammocks with their Wet Cloaths so that when they turn'd out they caus'd an ill smell whereever they came and their Ham∣mocks would stink sufficiently that I think the Remedying of this is worth the Care of Commanders that cross the  Line  especially when they are it may be a Month or more e'er they get out of the Rains at some times of the Year as in  June July  or  August  What I have here said about the Cur∣rents Winds Calms  c  in this Passage is chiefly for the farther Illustration of what I have heretofore observ'd in general about these Matters and especially as to Crossing the Line in my  Discourse of the Winds  c  in the Torrid Zone  See Vol II Part p Which Observations I have had very much confirm'd to me in the Course of this Voyage and I shall particularize in several of the chief of them as they come in my Way And indeed I think I may say this of the Main of the Observations in that  Treatise  that the clear Satisfaction I had about them and how much I might rely upon them was a great Ease to my  Mind during this Vexatious Voyage wherein the Ignorance and Obstinacy withal of some under me occasion'd me a great deal of Tronble tho' they found all along and were often forc'd to acknow∣ledge it that I was seldom out in my Con∣jectures when I told them usually before∣hand what Winds  c  we should meet with at such or such particular Places we should come at  Pernambuc  was the Port that I designed for at my first setting out from  St Jago  it being a Place most proper for my purpose by reason of its Situation lying near the Extremity of  C St Augustine  the Eastern∣most Promontory of  Brazil  by which means it not only enjoys the greater bene∣fit of the Seabreezes and is consequently more healthy than other Places to the Southward but is withal less subject to the Southerly CoastingTradewinds that blow half the Year on this Shore which were now drawing on and might be troublesome to me So that I might both hope to reach soonest  Pernambuc  as most directly and nearest in my Run and might thence also more easily get away to the Southward than from  Bahia de Todos los Santos  or  Ria Janeira  But notwithstanding these Advantages I propos'd to my self in going to  Pernambuc  I was soon put by that Design through the  refractoriness of some under me and the Discontents and Backwardness of some of my Men For the Calms and Shiftings of Wind which I met with as I was to expect in crossing the Line made them who were un∣acquainted with these Matters almost heartless as to the persuit of the Voyage as thinking we should never be able to weather C  St Augustine  And though I told them that by that time we should get to about three Degrees South of the Line we should again have a True brisk General TradeWind from the North East that would carry us to what part of  Brazil  we pleas'd yet they would not believe it till they found it so This with some other un∣foreseen Accidents not necessary to be mention'd in this place meeting with the Aversion of my Men to a long unknown Voyage made me justly ap∣prehensive of their Revolting and was a great Trouble and Hindrance to me So that I was obliged partly to alter my Measures and met with ma∣ny Difficulties the Particulars of which I shall not trouble the Reader with But I mention thus much of it in ge∣neral for my own necessary Vindica∣tion  in my taking such Measures some∣times for prosecuting the Voyage as the state of my Ships Crew rather than my own Judgment and Experience de∣termin'd me to The Disorders of my Ship made me think at present that  Pernambuc  would not be so fit a Place for me being told that Ships ride there two or three Leagues from the Town under the Command of no Forts so that whenever I should have been a∣shore it might have been easy for my discontented Crew to have cut or slipt their Cables and have gone away from me Many of them discovering already an Intention to return to  England  and some of them declaring openly that they would go no further onwards than  Brazil  I alter'd my Course therefore and stood away for  Bahio de todos los Santos  or the  Bay of All Saints  where I hop'd to have the Governor's help if need should require for securing my Ship from any such Mutinous Attempt be∣ing forc'd to keep my self all the way upon my Guard and to lie with my Of∣ficers such as I could trust and with small Arms upon the Quarterdeck it scarce being safe for me to lie in my Cabbin by Reason of the Discontents among my Men  On the d of  March  we saw the Land of  Brazil  having had thither from the time when we came into the True TradeWind again after crossing the Line very fair Weather and brisk Gales mostly at E N E The Land we saw was about Leagues to the North of  Bahia  so I coast∣ed along Shore to the Southward This Coast is rather low than high with SandyBays all along by the Sea  A little within Land are many very white Spots of Sand appearing like Snow and the Coast looks very pleasant being checker'd with Woods and Savanahs The Trees in general are not tall but they are green and flourishing There are ma∣ny small Houses by the Seaside whose In∣habitants are chiefly Fishermen They come off to Sea on Barklogs made of seve∣ral Logs fasten'd side to side that have one or two Masts with Sails to them There are two Men in each Barklog one at either end having small low Benches raised a little above the Logs to sit and fish on and two Baskets hanging up at the Mast or Masts one to put their Pro∣visions in the other for their Fish Many of these were a Fishing now and two of them came aboard of whom I bought some Fish In the Afternoon we sailed by one very remarkable piece of Land where on a small pleasant Hill there was a  Church dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  See a Sight of some parts of this Coast Table III N  o  and of the Hill the Church stands on Table III N  o    I coasted along till the Evening and then brought to and lay by till the next Morning About hours after we were brought to there came a Sail out of the Offin from Seaward and lay by about a Mile to Windward of us and so lay all Night In the Morning upon speaking with her she proved to be a  Portuguese  Ship bound to  Bahia  therefore I sent my Boat aboard and desired to have one of his Mates to Pilot me in He answer'd That he had not a Mate capable of it but that he would sail in before me and shew me the way and that if he went in to the Harbour in the Night he would hang out a Light for me He said we had not far in and might reach it before Night with a tolerable Gale but that with so small an one as now we had we could not do it So we jog'd on till Night and then he ac∣cordingly hung out his Light which we steered after sounding as we went in I kept all my Men on Deck and had an Anchor ready to let go on occasion We had the Tide of Ebb against us so that we went in but slowly and it was about the middle of the Night when we anchor'd Immediately the  Portuguese  Master came  depictions of Brazil  able III  Brazil  o  Conception of y  e  V Mary  o  The Land to y  e  Southward of

indeed I found much Respect not only from this Gentleman but from all of that Nation both here and in other Places who were ready to serve me on all Occasions The Place that we anchored in was about two Miles from the Harbour where the Ships generally ride but the Fear I had lest my People should run away with the Ship made me hasten to get a Licence from the Governor to run up into the Harbour and ride among their Ships close by one of their Forts So on the th of  March  about a Clock in the Morning the Tide serving I went thither being Piloted by the Superintendant there whose Business it is to carry up all the King of  Portugal  's Ships that come hither and to see them well moored He brought us to an An∣chor right against the Town at the outer part of the Harbour which was then full of Ships within yards of a small Fort that stands on a Rock half a mile from the Shore See a Prospect of the Harbour and the Town as it appear'd to us while we lay at Anchor Table III N  o    Bahia de todos los Santos  lies in Lat deg S It is the most considerable Town in  Brazil  whether in respect of the Beauty of its Buildings its Bulk or its Trade and Revenue It has the convenience of a  good Harbour that is capable of receiving Ships of the greatest Burthen The En∣trance of which is guarded with a strong Fort standing without the Harbour call'd  St Antonio  A Sight of which I have gi∣ven Table III N  o  as it appear'd to us the Afternoon before we came in and its Lights which they hang out purpose∣ly for Ships we saw the same Night There are other smaller Forts that com∣mand the Harbour one of which stands on a Rock in the Sea about half a mile from the Shore Close by this Fort all Ships must pass that anchor here and must ride also within half a mile of it at farthest between this and another Fort that stands on a Point at the inner part of the Har∣bour and is called the  Dutch  Fort but must ride nearest to the former all along against the Town where there is good holding Ground and less exposed to the Southerly Winds that blow very hard here They commonly set in about  April  but blow hardest in  May June July  and  August  but the Place where the Ships ride is ex∣posed to these Winds not above Points of the Compass  Beside these there is another Fort front∣ing the Harbour and standing on the Hill upon which the Town stands The Town it self consists of about Houses the major part of which cannot be seen  from the Harbour but so many as appear in sight with a great mixture of Trees be∣tween them and all placed on a rising Hill make a very pleasant Prospect as may be judg'd by the Draught Table III N  o    There are in the Town Churches Chapels Hospitals Convents beside one Nunnery  viz  the  Ecclesia Major  or Ca∣thedral the Jesuits College which are the chief and both in sight from the Har∣bour  St Antonio Sta Barbara  both Pa∣rishChurches the  Franciscans  Church and the  Dominicans  and two Convents of  Carmelites  a Chapel for Seamen close by the Seaside where Boats commonly land and the Seamen go immediately to Prayers another Chapel for poor People at the farther end of the same Street which runs along by the Shore and a third Chapel for Soldiers at the edge of the Town remote from the Sea and an Hospital in the middle of the Town The Nunnery stands at the outeredge of the Town next the Fields wherein by Report there are Nuns Here lives an Arch∣bishop who has a fine Palace in the Town and the Governor's Palace is a fair Stonebuilding and looks handsome to the Sea tho' but indifferently furnish'd with∣in both  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  in their Plantations abroad as I have generally  observ'd affecting to have large Houses but are little curious about Furniture ex∣cept Pictures some of them The Houses of the Town are or Stories high the Walls thick and strong being built with Stone with a Covering of Pantile and many of them have Balconies The prin∣cipal Streets are large and all of them pav'd or pitch'd with small Stones There are also Parades in the most eminent Places of the Town and many Gardens as well within the Town as in the Outparts of it wherein are Fruittrees Herbs Salladings and Flowers in great variety but order'd with no great Care nor Art  The Governor who resides here is call'd  Don John de Lancastario  being descended as they say from our  English Lancaster  Fa∣mily and he has a respect for our Nation on that account calling them his Country∣men I waited on him several times and always found him very courteous and civil Here are about Soldiers in Garison They commonly draw up and exercise in a large Parade before the Governor's House and many of them attend him when he goes abroad The Soldiers are decently clad in brown Linen which in these hot Countries is sar better than Woollen but I never saw any clad in Linen but only these Beside the Soldiers in Pay he can soon have some thousands of Men up in  Arms on occasion The Magazine is on the Skirts of the Town on a small rising between the Nunnery and the Soldiers Church 'Tis big enough to hold or Barrels of Powder but I was told it seldom has more than sometimes but There are always a Band of Soldiers to guard it and Centinels looking out both Day and Night  A great many Merchants always reside at  Bahia  for 'tis a Place of great Trade I found here above great Ships from  Europe  with two of the King of  Portugal  's Ships of War for their Convoy beside two Ships that Traded to  Africa  only either to  Angola Gamba  or other Places on the Coast of  Guinea  and abundance of small Craft that only run to and fro on this Coast carrying Commodities from one part of  Brazil  to another  The Merchants that live here are said to be Rich and to have many  Negro  Slaves in their Houses both of Men and Women Themselves are chiefly  Portu∣guese  Foreigners having but little Com∣merce with them yet here was one Mr  Cock  an  English  Merchant a very civil Gentleman and of good Repute He had a Patent to be our  English  Consul but did not care to take upon him any Publick Character because  English  Ships seldom come hither here having been none in  or years before this time Here was also a  Dane  and a  French  Merchant or two but all have their Effects transported to and from  Europe  in  Portuguese  Ships none of any other Nation being admitted to Trade hither There is a Customhouse by the Seaside where all Goods imported or exported are entred And to prevent Abuses there are or Boats that take their turns to row about the Harbour searching any Boats they suspect to be run∣ning of Goods  The chief Commodities that the  Eu∣ropean  Ships bring hither are Linnen∣cloaths both course and fine some Wool∣lens also as Bays Searges Perpetuana's  c  Hats Stockings both of Silk and Thread Bisketbread Wheatflower Wine chiefly  Port  OilOlive Butter Cheese  c  and Saltbeef and Pork would there also be good Commodities They bring hither also Iron and all sorts of IronTools PewterVessels of all sorts as Dishes Plates Spoons  c  Looking∣glasses Beads and other Toys and the Ships that touch at  St Jago  bring thence as I said Cotton cloath which is after∣wards sent to  Angola  The  European  Ships carry from hence Sugar Tobacco either in Roll or Snuff never in Leaf that I know of These are the Staple Commodities Besides which  here are Dyewoods as Fustick  c  with Woods for other uses as speckled Wood  Brazil  c They also carry home raw Hides Tallow TrainOil of Whales  c  Here are also kept tame Monkeys Parrots Parakites  c  which the Seamen carry home  The Sugar of this Country is much bet∣ter than that which we bring home from our Plantations for all the Sugar that is made here is clay'd which makes it whiter and finer than our  Muscovada  as we call our unrefin'd Sugar Our Planters seldom refine any with Clay unless sometimes a little to send home as Presents for their Friends in  England  Their way of doing it is by taking some of the whitest Clay and mixing it with Water 'till 'tis like Cream With this they fill up the Pans of Sugar that are sunk or Inches below the Brim by the draining of the Molosses out of it First scraping off the thin hard Crust of the Sugar that lies at the top and would hinder the Water of the Clay from soak∣ing through the Sugar of the Pan The refining is made by this Percolation For or days time that the Clayish Li∣quor lies soaking down the Pan the white Water whitens the Sugar as it passes thro' it and the gross Body of the Clay it self grows hard on the top and may be taken off at pleasure when scraping off with a  Knife the very upper part of the Sugar which will be a little sullied that which is underneath will be White almost to the bottom and such as is called  Brazil  Sugar is thus Whitened When I was here this Sugar was sold for  s per    lb  and the Bottoms of the Pots which is very course Sugar for about  s per    lb  both sorts being then scarce for here was not enough to lade the Ships and therefore some of them were to lie here till the next Sea∣son  The  European  Ships commonly arrive here in  February  or  March  and they have generally quick Passages finding at that time of the Year brisk Gales to bring them to the Line little Trouble then in cros∣sing it and brisk E N E Winds after∣wards to bring them hither They com∣monly return from hence about the latter end of  May  or in  June  'Twas said when I was here that the Ships would sail hence the th day of  May  and therefore they were all very busy some in taking in their Goods others in Careening and making themselves ready The Ships that come hither usually Careen at their first coming here being a Hulk belonging to the King for that purpose This Hulk is under the charge of the Superintendent I spoke of who has a certain Sum of Mony for every Ship that Careens by her He also pro∣vides  Firing and other Necessaries for that purpose and the Ships do commonly hire of the Merchants here each Cables to moor by all the time they lie here and so save their own Hempen Cables for these are made of a sort of Hair that grows on a certain kind of Trees hanging down from the Top of their Bodies and is very like the black  Coyre  in the  EastIn∣dies  if not the same These Cables are strong and lasting And so much for the  European  Ships  The Ships that use the  Guinea  Trade are small Vessels in comparison of the for∣mer They carry out from hence Rum Sugar the Cottoncloaths of St  Jago  Beads  c  and bring in return Gold Ivory and Slaves making very good re∣turns  The small Craft that belong to this Town are chiefly imployed in carrying  European  Goods from  Bahia  the Center of the  Brasilian  Trade to the other Places on this Coast bringing back hither Sugar Tobacco  c  They are sailed chiefly with NegroSlaves and about  Christmas  these are mostly imployed in Whalekill∣ing for about that time of the Year a sort Whales as they call them are very thick on this Coast They come in also into the Harbours and inland Lakes where the Seamen go out and kill them The Fat of  them is boyled to Oyl the Lean is eaten by the Slaves and poor People And I was told by one that had frequently eaten of it that the Flesh was very sweet and whole∣some These are said to be but small Whales yet here are so many and so easily kill'd that they get a great deal of Mony by it Those that strike them buy their Licence for it of the King And I was informed that he receives Dol∣lars  per Annum  for this Fishery All the small Vessels that use this Coasting Traf∣fick are built here and so are some Men of War also for the King'sService There was one a Building when I was here a Ship of or Guns And the Timber of this Country is very good and proper for this purpose I was told it was very strong and more durable than any we have in  Europe  and they have enough of it As for their Ships that use the  European  Trade some of them that I saw there were  Eng∣lish  built taken from us by the  French  dur∣ing the late War and sold by them to the  Portugese  Besides Merchants and others that Trade by Sea from this Port here are other pret∣ty Wealthy Men and several Artificers and Tradesmen of most sorts who by Labour and Industry maintain themselves very well especially such as can arrive at the purchase of a  Negro  Slave or two  And indeed excepting People of the low∣est degree of all here are scarce any but what keep Slaves in their Houses The Richer Sort besides the Slaves of both Sexes whom they keep for servile Uses in their Houses have Menslaves who wait on them abroad for State either run∣ning by their Horsessides when they ride out or to carry them to and fro on their Shoulders in the Town when they make short Visits near home Every Gen∣tleman or Merchant is provided with Things necessary for this sort of Carriage The main Thing is a pretty large Cotton Hammock of the  WestIndia  Fashion but mostly dyed Blue with large Fringes of the same hanging down on each side This is carry'd on the  Negro  's Shoulders by the help of a Bambo about or Foot long to which the Hammock is hung and a Covering comes over the Pole hanging down on each side like a Curtain So that the Person so carry'd cannot be seen unless he pleases but may either ly down hav∣ing Pillows for his Head or may sit up by being a little supported with these Pil∣lows and by letting both his Legs hang out over one side of the Hammock When he hath a mind to be seen he puts by his Curtain and salutes every one of his Ac∣quaintance whom he meets in the Streets for they take a piece of Pride in greeting  one another from their Hammocks and will hold long Conferences thus in the Streets But then their two Slaves who carry the Hammock have each a strong wellmade Staff with a fine Iron Fork at the upper end and a sharp Iron below like the Rest for a Musket which they stick fast in the Ground and let the Pole or Bambo of the Hammock rest upon them till their Masters Business or the Complement is over There is scarce a Man of any fashion especially a Woman will pass the Streets but so carried in a Hammock The chief Mechanick Traders here are Smiths Hatters Shoemakers Tanners Sawyers Carpenters Coopers  c  Here are also Taylors Butchers  c  which last kill the Bullocks very dexte∣rously sticking them at one Blow with a sharppointed Knife in the Nape of the Neck having first drawn them close to a Rail but they dress them very slovenly It being  Lent  when I came hither there was no buying any Flesh till  EasterEve  when a great number of Bullocks were kill'd at once in the Slaughterhouses with∣in the Town Men Women and Children flocking thither with great Joy to buy and a multitude of Dogs almost starv'd following them for whom the Meat seem'd fittest it was so Lean All these Tradesmen buy  Negro  's and train  them up to their several Imployments which is a great help to them and they having so frequent Trade to  Angola  and other parts of  Guinea  they have a constant supply of Blacks both for their Plantations and Town These Slaves are very useful in this Place for Carriage as Porters for as here is a great Trade by Sea and the Landingplace is at the foot of a Hill too steep for drawing with Carts so there is great need of Slaves to carry Goods up in∣to the Town especially for the inferiour sort but the Merchants have also the Convenience of a great Crane that goes with Ropes or Pullees one end of which goes up while the other goes down The House in which this Crane is stands on the Brow of the Hill towards the Sea hanging over the Precipice and there are Planks set shelving against the Bank from thence to the Bottom against which the Goods lean or slide as they are hoisted up or let down The  Negro  Slaves in this Town are so nu∣merous that they make up the greatest part or bulk of the Inhabitants Every House as I said having some both Men and Women of them Many of the  Por∣tuguese  who are Batchelors keep of these black Women for Misses tho' they know the danger they are in of being poyson'd by them if ever they give them any occa∣sion of Jealousy A Gentleman of my Ac∣quaintance  who had been familiar with his Cookmaid lay under some such Apprehensions from her when I was there These Slaves also of either Sex will easily be engaged to do any sort of Mischief even to Murder if they are hired to do it especially in the Night for which Reason I kept my Men on board as much as I could for one of the  French  King's Ships being here had several Men murder'd by them in the Night as I was credibly in∣form'd  Having given this account of the Town of  Bahia  I shall next say somewhat of the Country There is a Saltwater Lake runs Leagues as I was told up the Country N W from the Sea leaving the Town and  Dutch  Fort on the Star∣board fide The Country all round a∣bout is for the most part a pretty flat e∣ven Ground not high nor yet very low It is well watered with Rivers Brooks and Springs neither wants it for good Harbours Navigable Creeks and good Bays for Ships to ride in The Soil in general is good naturally producing very latge Trees of divers sorts and fit for any uses The Savannahs also are loaden with Grass Herbs and many sorts of smaller Vegetables and being cultivated produce any thing that is proper for those hot Countrys as SugarCanes Cotton Indi∣co  Tobacco Maiz FruitTrees of seve∣ral kinds and Eatable Roots of all sorts Of the several kinds of Trees that are here I shall give an account of some as I had it partly from an Inhabitant of  Bahia  and partly from my knowledge of them other∣wise  viz Sapiera Vermiatico Comesse∣rie Guitteba Serrie  as they were pronounc'd to me three sorts of  Mangrove  speckled Wood Fustick CottonTrees of three sorts  c  together with FruitTrees of divers sorts that grow wild beside such as are planted  Of TimberTrees the  Sapiera  is said to be large and tall it is very good Timber and is made use of in building of Houses so is the  Vermiatico  a tall streightbodied Tree of which they make Plank Foot broad and they also make Canoa's with it  Comesserie  and  Guitteba  are chiesly u∣sed in building Ships these are as much esteemed here as Oaks are in  England  and they say either sort is harder and more durable than Oak The  Serrie  is a sort of Tree much like Elm very durable in water Here are also all the three sorts of  Mangrove  Trees  viz  the Red the White and the Black which I have de∣scribed  Vol  I  p  The Bark of the Red Mangrove is here used for Tanning of Leather and they have great Tanpits for it The Black Mangrove grows lar∣ger  here than in the  WestIndies  and of it they make good Plank The White Mangrove is larger and tougher than in the  WestIndies  of these they make Masts and Yards for Barks  There grow here Wild or Bastard Co∣co Nut Trees neither so large nor so tall as the common ones in the  East  or  WestIndies  They bear Nuts as the others but not a quarter so big as the right CocoNuts The shell is full of Kernel with∣out any hollow Place or Water in it and the Kernel is sweet and wholesome but very hard both for the Teeth and for Di∣gestion These Nuts are in much esteem for making Beads for  Paternoster  's Boles of Tobaccopipes and other Toys and every small Shop here has a great many of them to sell At the top of these Bastard Cocotrees among the Branches there grows a sort of long black Thread like Horsehair but much longer which by the  Portuguese  is called  Tresabo  Of this they make Cables which are very service∣able strong and lasting for they will not rot as Cables made of Hemp tho' they ly exposed both to Wet and Heat These are the Cables which I said they keep in their Harbours here to let to hire to  European  Ships and resemble the  Coyre  Cables  Here are three sorts of Cotton Trees that bear Silkcotton One sort is such as I  have formerly described Vol I p by the Name of the Cottontree The other two sorts I never saw any where but here The Trees of these latter sorts are but small in comparison of the former which are reckon'd the biggest in all the  WestIndia  Woods yet are however of a good bigness and heighth One of these last sorts is not so full of Branches as the other of them neither do they produce their Fruit the same time of the Year for one sort had its Fruit just ripe and was shedding its Leaves while the other sort was yet green and its Fruit small and growing having but newly done blossom∣ing the Tree being as full of young Fruit as an AppleTree ordinarily in  England  These last yield very large Pods about inches long and as big as a Man's Arm It is ripe in  September  and  October  then the Pod opens and the Cotton bursts out in a great Lump as big as a Man's Head They gather these Pods before they open otherways it would fly all away It opens as well after 'tis gathered and then they take out the Cotton and preserve it to sill Pillows and Bolsters for which use 'tis very much esteemed but 'tis fit for no∣thing else being so short that it cannot be spun 'Tis of a tawney Colour and the Seeds are black very round and as big as a white Pea The other sort is ripe  in  March  or  April  The Fruit or Pod is like a large Apple and very round The outside Shell is as thick as the top of ones Finger Within this there is a very thin whitish Bag or Skin which incloseth the Cotton When the CottonApple is ripe the outer thick green Shell splits it self into equal parts from Stemb to Tail and drops off leaving the Cotton hanging upon the Stemb only pent up in its fine Bag A day or two afterwards the Cotton swells by the heat of the Sun breaks the Bag and bursts out as big as a Man's Head And then as the Wind blows 'tis by degrees driven away a little at a time out of the Bag that still hangs upon the Stemb and is scatter'd about the Fields the Bag soon following the Cotton and the Stemb the Bag Here is also a little of the right  WestIndia  Cotton Shrub but none of the Cotton is exported nor do they make much Cloth of it  This Country produces great variety of fine Fruits as very good Oranges of or sorts especially one sort of  China  Oran∣ges Limes in abundance Pomgranets Pomecitrons Plantains Bonano's right Coconuts Guava's Cocoplumbs call'd here  Munsheroo  's WildGrapes such as I have describ'd Vol II Part p beside such Grapes as grow in  Europe  Here are also Hogplumbs CustardAp∣ples  Soursops Cashews Papah  's called here  Mamoons    Jennipah  's called here  Jennipapah  's ManchineelApples and Man∣go's Mango's are yet but rare here I saw none of them but in the  Jesuit  's Gar∣den which has a great many fine Fruits and some Cinamontrees These both of them were first brought from the  EastIndies  and they thrive here very well So do Pumplemusses brought also from thence and both  China  and  Sevil  Oranges are here very plentiful as well as good  The  Soursop  as we call it is a large Fruit as big as a Man's Head of a long or oval Shape and of a green Colour but one side is Yellowish when ripe The out∣side Rind or Coat is pretty thick and very rough with small sharp Knobs the in∣side is full of spungy Pulp within which also are many black Seeds or Kernels in shape and bigness like a Pumkinseed The Pulp is very juicy of a pleasant Taste and wholesome You suck the Juice out of the Pulp and so spit it out The Tree or Shrub that bears this Fruit grows about or Foot high with a small short Body the Branches growing pretty strait up for I did never see any of them spread abroad The Twigs are slender and tough and so is the Stemb of the Fruit This Fruit grows also both in the  East  and  VVestIndies  The  Cashew  is a Fruit as big as a Pippin pretty long and bigger near the Stemb than at the other end growing tapering The Rind is smooth and thin of a red and yellow Colour The Seed of this Fruit grows at the end of it 'tis of an Olive Colour shaped like a Bean and about the same bigness but not altogether so flat The Tree is as big as an Apple tree with Branches not thick yet spreading off The Boughs are gross the Leaves broad and round and in substance pretty thick This Fruit is soft and spongy when ripe and so full of Juice that in biting it the Juice will run out on both sides of ones Mouths It is very pleasant and gratefully rough on the Tongue and is accounted a very wholesome Fruit This grows both in the  East  and  West Indies  where I have seen and eaten of it  The  Jenipah  or  Jenipapah  is a sort of Fruit of the Calabash or Gourdkind It is about the bigness of a DuckEgg and somewhat of an Oval Shape and is of a grey Colour The Shell is not altogether so thick nor hard as a Calabash 'Tis full of whitish Pulp mixt with small flat Seeds and both Pulp and Seeds must be taken in∣to the Mouth where sucking out the Pulp you spit out Seeds It is of a sharp and pleasing Taste and is very innocent The Tree that bears it is much like an Ash  straitbodied and of a good heighth clean from Limbs till near the top where there branches forth a small Head The Rind is of a pale grey and so is the Fruit We us'd of this Tree to make Helves or Handles for Axes for which it is very pro∣per in the Bay of  Campeachy  where I have seen of them and no where else but here  Beside these here are many sorts of Fruits which I have not met with any where but here as  Arisah  's  Mericasah  's  Petango  's  c Arisah  's are an excellent Fruit not much bigger than a large Cherry shaped like a CatherinePear being small at the Stemb and swelling bigger towards the end They are of a greenish colour and have small Seeds as big as MustardSeeds They are somewhat tart yet pleasant and ve∣ry wholsom and may be eaten by sick People  Mericasah  's are an excellent Fruit of which there are two sorts one growing on a small Tree or Shrub which is count∣ed the best the other growing on a kind of Shrub like a Vine which they plant about Arbours to make a shade having many broad Leaves The Fruit is as big as a small Orange round and green When they are ripe they are soft and fit to eat full of white pulp mixt thick with little black Seeds and there is no separating one from the other till they are in your  Mouth when you suck in the white Pulp and spit out the Stones They are tart pleasant and very wholsome  Petango  's are a small red Fruit that grow also on small Trees and are as big as Cherries but not so Globular having one flat side and also or small protule∣rant Ridges 'Tis a very pleasant tart Fruit and has a pretty large flattish Stone in the middle  Petumbo  's are a yellow Fruit grow∣ing on a shrub like a Vine bigger than Cherries with a pretty large Stone These are sweet but rough in the Mouth  Mungaroo  's are a Fruit as big as Cher∣ries red on one side and white on the o∣ther side They are said to be full of small Seeds which are commonly swallowed in eating them  Muckishaw  's are said to be a Fruit as big as CrabApples growing on large Trees They have also small Seeds in the mid∣dle and are well tasted  Ingwa  's are a Fruit like the LocustFruit Inches long and one broad They grow on high Trees  Otee  is a Fruit as big as a large CocoNut It hath a Husk on the outside and a large Stone within and is a accounted a very fine Fruit  Musterandeova  's are a round Fruit as big as large HazelNuts cover'd with thin brittle shells of a blackish colour They have a small Stone in the middle inclosed within a black pulpy substance which is of a pleasant taste The outside shell is chewed with the Fruit and spit out with the Stone when the pulp is suck'd from them The Tree that bears this Fruit is tall large and very hard Wood I have not seen any of these five last named Fruits but had them thus described to me by an  Irish  Inhabitant of  Bahia  tho' as to this last I am apt to believe I may have both seen and eaten of them in  Achin  in  Su∣matra  PalmBerries  called here  Dendees  grow plentifully about  Bahia  the largest are as big as Wallnuts they grow in bunches on the top of the Body of the Tree a∣mong the Roots of the Branches or Leaves as all Fruits of the Palm kind do These are the same kind of Berries or Nuts as those they make the PalmOyl with on the Coast of  Guinea  where they abound And I was told that they make Oyl with them here also They sometimes roast and eat them but when I had one roasted to prove it I did not like it  PhysickNuts  as our Seamen call them are called here  Pineon  and  Agnus Castus  is called here  Carrepat  These both grow  here so do  Mendibees  a Fruit like  PhysickNuts  They scorch them in a Pan over the fire before they eat them  Here are also great plenty of CabbageTrees and other Fruits which I did not get information about and which I had not the opportunity of seeing because this was not the Season it being our Spring and consequently their Autumn when their best Fruits were gone tho' some were left However I saw abundance of wild Berries in the Woods and Field but I could not learn their Names or Nature  They have withal good plenty of ground Fruit as  Callavances  PineApples Pum∣kins WaterMelons MuskMelons Cu∣cumbers and Roots as Yams Potato's Cassava's  c  Garden Herbs also good store as Cabbages Turnips Onions Leeks and abundance of other Salading and for the Pot Drugs of several sorts  viz  Sassafras SnakeRoot  c  Beside the Woods I mentioned for Dying and other Uses as Fustick Speckledwood  c  I brought home with me from hence a good number of Plants dried between the leaves of Books of some of the choicest of which that are not spoil'd I may give a Specimen at the  End  of the  Book  Here are said to be great plenty and va∣riety of WildFowl  viz Yemma  's  Maccaw  's which are called here  Jackoo  's and are a larger sort of Parrots and scarcer Par∣rots  Parakites Flamingo's CarrionCrows ChatteringCrows Cockrecoes BillBirds finely painted Corresoes Doves Pigeons  Jenetees  ClockingHens Crabcatchers Galdens Currecoo's Moscovy Ducks common Ducks Widgeons Teal Cur∣lews Men of War Birds Booby's Nod∣dy's Pelicans  c  The  Yemma  is bigger than a Swan grey∣feathered with a long thick sharppoint∣ed Bill  The CarrionCrow and ChatteringCrows are called here  Mackeraw  's and are like those I described in the  WestIndies    Vol  II  Part  II  p  The Bill of the ChatteringCrow is black and the UpperBill is round bending downwards like a HawksBill rising up in a ridge almost semicircular and very sharp both at the Ridge or Convexity and at the Point or Extremity The LowerBill is flat and shuts even with it I was told by a  Por∣tegueze  here that their  Negro  Wenches make LovePotions with these Birds And the  Portuguese  care not to let them have any of these Birds to keep them from that Superstition As I found one Afternoon when I was in the Fields with a Padre and another who shot two of them and hid them as they said for that reason They are not good Food but their Bills are reckoned a good Antidote against Poi∣son  The  BillBirds  are so called by the  En∣glish  from their monstrous Bills which are as big as their Bodies I saw none of these Birds here but saw several of the Breasts flea'd off and dried for the beau∣ty of them the Feathers were curiously colour'd with red yellow and Orangecolour  The  Curreso  's called here  Mackeraw  's are such as are in the Bay of  Campeachy  Vol Part p  TurtleDoves  are in great plenty here and two sorts of Wild Pigeons the one sort blackish the other a light grey The blackish or dark grey are the bigger be∣ing as large as our WoodQuests or WoodPigeons in  England  Both sorts are very good Meat and are in such plenty from  May  till  September  that a Man may shoot or Dozen in several Shots at one standing in a close misty Morning when they come to seed on Berries that grow in the Woods  The  Jenetee  is a Bird as big as a Lark with blackish Feathers and yellow Legs and Feet 'Tis accounted very wholsom Food  ClockingHens are much like the Crab∣catchers which I have described  Vol  II  Part    p  but the Legs are not alto∣gether so long They keep always in swampy wet places tho' their Claws are  like LandFowl's Claws They make a Noise or  Cluck  like our BroodHens or DunghilHens when they have Chickens and for that reason they are called by the  English  Clocking Hens There are many of them in the Bay of  Campeachy  tho' I omitted to speak of them there and else∣where in the  WestIndies  There are both here and there four sorts of these long∣leg'd Fowls near akin to each other as so many  SubSpecies  of the same Kind  viz  Crab catchers ClockingHens Gal∣dens which three are in shape and co∣lour like Herons in  England  but less the  Galden  the biggest of the three the Crab∣catcher the smallest and a fourth sort which are black but shaped like the other having long Legs and short Tails these are about the bigness of  Crabcatchers  and feed as they do  Currecoos  are Water Fowls as big as pretty large Chickens of a bluish colour with short Legs and Tail they feed al∣so in swampy Ground and are very good Meat I have not seen of them else∣where  The WildDucks here are said to be of two sorts the  Muscovy  and the com∣monDucks In the wet Season here are abundance of them but in the dry time but few Wigeon and Teal also are said to be in great plenty here in the wet Sea∣son  To the Southward of  Bahia  there are al∣so Ostridges in great plenty tho' 'tis said they are not so large as those of  Africa  They are found chiefly in the Southern Parts of  Brasil  especially among the large Savanahs near the River of  Plate  and from thence further South towards the Streights of  Magellan  As for Tame Fowl at  Bahia  the chief beside their Ducks are DunghilFowls os which they have two sorts one sort much of the size of our Cocks and Hens the other very large and the Feathers of these last are a long time coming forth so that you see them very naked when half grown but when they are full grown and well feathered they appear very large Fowls as indeed they are neither do they want for price for they are sold at  Bahia  sor half a Crown or three Shillings apiece just as they are brought first to Market out of the Countrey when they are so lean as to be scarce fit to Eat  The Land Animals here are Horses black Cattle Sheep Goats Rabbits Hogs Leopards Tigers Foxes Mon∣keys Pecary a sort of wild Hogs called here  Pica  Armadillo Alligaters Guano's called  Quittee  Lizards Serpents Toads Frogs and a sort of Amphibious Crea∣tures called by the  Portuguese Cuchora's de agua  in  English  WaterDogs  The Leopards and Tigers of this Coun∣try are said to be large and very fierce But here on the Coast they are either de∣stroyed or driven back towards the heart of the Country and therefore are seldom found but in the Borders and Outplanta∣tions where they oftentimes do Mischief Here are three or four sorts of Monkeys of different Sizes and Colours One sort is very large and another sort is very small These last are ugly in Shape and Feature and have a strong Scent of Musk  Here are several sorts of Serpents many of them vastly great and most of them very venomous As the Rattlesnake for one and for Venome a small Green Snake is bad enough no bigger than the Stemb of a Tobaccopipe and about Inches long very common here  They have here also the  Amphisbaena  or Twoheaded Snake of a grey Colour mixt with blackish Stripes whose Bite is reckon'd to be incurable 'Tis said to be blind tho' it has two small Specks in each Head like Eyes but whether it sees or not I cannot tell They say it lives like a Mole mostly under Ground and that when it is found above Ground it is easily kill'd because it moves but slowly Nei∣ther is its Sight if it hath any so good as to discern any one that comes near to Kill  as few of these Creatures fly at a Man or hurt him but when he comes in their Way 'Tis about Inches long and about the bigness of the inner joint of a Man's mid∣dle Finger being of one and the same bigness from one end to the other with a Head at each end as they said for I cannot vouch it for one I had was cut short at one end and both alike in shape and bigness and 'tis said to move with either Head formost indifferently whence 'tis called by the  Portugueze Cobra de dos Cabesas  the Snake with two Heads  The small black Snake is a very veno∣mous Creature  There is also a grey Snake with red and brown Spots all over its Back 'Tis as big as a Man's Arm and about Foot long and is said to be venomous I saw one of these  Here are two sorts of very large Snakes or Serpents One of 'em a Landsnake the other a Watersnake The Landsnake is of a grey colour and about or Foot long Not very Venomous but Ravenous I was promised the sight of one of their Skins but wanted opportu∣nity  The Watersnake is said to be near Foot long These live wholly in the Wa∣ter either in large Rivers or great Lakes and prey upon any Creature that comes  within their reach be it Man or Beast They draw their Prey to them with their Tails for when they see any thing on the Banks of the River or Lake where they lurk they swing about their Tails or Foot over the Bank and whatever stands within their Sweep is snatcht with great Violence into the River and drown∣ed by them Nay 'tis reported very cre∣dibly that if they see only a shade of any Animal at all on the Water they will flourish their Tails to bring in the Man or Beast whose shade they see and are often∣times too successful in it Wherefore Men that have Business near any place where these WaterMonsters are suspected to lurk are always provided with a Gun which they often fire and that scares them away or keeps them quiet They are said to have great Heads and strong Teeth a∣bout Inches long I was told by an  Irish  Man who lived here that his Wives Fa∣ther was very near being taken by one of them about the time of my first Arrival here when his Father was with him up in the Country for the Beast flourisht his Tail for him but came not nigh enough by a yard or two however it scared him sufficiently  The Amphibious Creatures here which I said are called by the  Portuguese Cuchora  's  de Agua  or Waterdogs are said to be as  big as small Mastives and are all hairy and shaggy from Head to Tail They have short Legs a pretty long Head and short Tail and are of a blackish colour They live in fresh Waterponds and of∣tentimes come ashore and Sun themselves but retire to the Water if assaulted They are eaten and said to be good Food Se∣veral of these Creatures which I have now spoken of I have not seen but inform'd my self about them while I was here at  Bahia  from sober and sensible Persons a∣mong the Inhabitants among whom I met with some that could speak  English  In the Sea upon this Coast there is great store and diversity of Fish  viz  Jewfish for which there is a great Market at  Bahia  in  Lent  Tarpom's Mullets Groopers Snooks Garfish called here  Goolion  's  Gorasses  Barrama's Coquinda's Caval∣lie's Cuchora's or Dogfish CongerEeles Herrings as I was told the  Ser∣rew  the  Olio de Boy  I write and spell them just as they were named to me Whales  c  Here is also Shellfish tho' in less plenty about  Bahia  than on other parts of the Coast  viz  Lobsters Crawfish Shrimps Crabs Oysters of the common sort Conchs Wilks Cockles Muscles Perri∣winkles  c  Here are three sorts of SeaTurtle  viz  Hawksbill Loggerhead and  Green but none of them are in any esteem neither  Spaniards  nor  Portuguese  loving them Nay they have a great An∣tipathy against them and would much ra∣ther eat a Porpose tho' our  English  count the Green Turtle very extraordinary Food The Reason that is commonly given in the  WestIndies  for the  Spaniards  not caring to eat of them is the fear they have lest be∣ing usually foulbodied and many of them pox'd lying as they do so promiscuous∣ly with their Negrines and other She∣slaves they should break out loathsomely like Lepers which this sort of Food 'tis said does much incline Men to do search∣ing the Body and driving out any such gross Humors for which cause many of our  English  Valetudinarians have gone from  Jamaica  tho' there they have also Turtle to the I  Caimanes  at the Laying∣time to live wholly upon Turtle that then abound there purposely to have their Bodies scour'd by this Food and their Di∣stempers driven out and have been said to have found many of them good Success in it But this by the way The Hawks∣billTurtle on this Coast of  Brazil  is most sought after of any for its Shell which by Report of those I have convers'd with at  Bahia  is the clearest and bestclouded Tortoiseshell in the World I had some of it shewn me which was indeed as good  as I ever saw They get a pretty deal of it in some Parts on this Coast but 'tis ve∣ry dear  Besides this Port of  Bahia de todos los San∣tos  there are two more principal Ports on  Brazil  where  European  Ships Trade  viz Pernambuc  and  Ria Janeira  and I was told that there go as many Ships to each of these Places as to  Bahia  and two Men of War to each Place for their Convoys Of the other Ports in this Country none is of greater Note than that of St  Paul  's where they gather much Gold but the Inhabitants are said to be a sort of  Banditti  or loose People that live under no Govern∣ment but their Gold brings them all sorts of Commodities that they need as Cloths Arms Ammunition  c  The Town is said to be large and strong  CHAP III  The A's Stay and Business at  Bahia  Of the Winds and Seasons of the Year there His departure for  N Holland

of  Goa  came hither from thence in a great Ship said to be richly laden with all sorts of  India  Goods but she did not break Bulk here being bound home for  Lisbon  only the ViceRoy intended to re∣fresh his Men of whom he had lost many and most of the rest were very sickly having been Months in their Voyage hi∣ther and so to take in Water and depart for  Europe  in Company with the other  Portuguese  Ships thither Bound who had Orders to be ready to Sail by the twentieth of  May  He desir'd me to car∣ry a Letter for him directed to his Suc∣cessor the new ViceRoy of  Goa  Which I did sending it thither afterwards by Captain  Hammond  whom I found near the  Cape of Good Hope  The Refresh∣ing my Men and taking in Water was the main also of my Business here be∣side the having the better opportuni∣ty to compose the Disorders among my Crew Which as I have before relat∣ed were grown to so great a Heighth that they could not without great Dif∣ficulty be appeased However finding Opportunity during my stay in this Place to allay in some measure the Ferment that had been raised among my Men I now set my self to provide for the car∣rying on of my Voyage with more Heart than before and put all Hands to work in order to it as fast as the backwardness of my Men would per∣mit who shew'd continually their un∣willingness to proceed farther Besides their Heads were generally fill'd with strange Notions of Southerly Winds that were now setting in and there had been already some Flurries of them  which as they surmiz'd would hinder any farther Attempts of going on to the Southward so long as they should last  The Winds begin to shift here in  April  and  September  and the Seasons of the Year the Dry and the Wet alter with them In  April  the Southerly Winds make their entrance on this Coast bringing in the Wet Season with violent Tornado's Thunder and Light∣ning and much Rain In  September  the other Coasting Trade at East North East comes in and clears the Sky bring∣ing fair Weather This as to the change of Wind is what I have observ'd Vol II Part p but as to the change of Weather accompanying it so exactly here at  Bahia  this is a particular Excep∣tion to what I have Experienc'd in all other Places of South Latitudes that I have been in between the  Tropicks  or those I have heard of for there the Dry Seasons sets in in  April  and the Wet about  October  or  November  sooner or later as I have said that they are in South Latitudes the Reverse of the Seasons or Weather in the same Months in N La∣titudes Vol II Part p whereas on this Coast of  Brazil  the Wet Season  comes in in  April  at the same time that it doth in N Latitudes and the Dry as I have said here in  September  the Rains here not lasting so far in the year as in o∣ther Places for in  September  the Weather is usually so fair that in the latter part of that Month they begin to cut their Su∣garCanes here as I was told for I en∣quired particularly about the Seasons Though this as to the Season of cut∣ting of Canes which I was now as∣sur'd to be in  September  agrees not very well with what I was formerly told Vol II Part p that in  Brazil  they cut the Canes in  July  And so as to what is said a little lower in the same Page that in managing their Canes they are not confin'd to the Seasons this ought to have been express'd only of Planting them for they never cut them but in the Dry Season  But to return to the Southerly Winds which came in as I expected they would while I was here These daunted my Ship's Company very much tho' I had told them they were to look for them But they being ignorant as to what I told them farther that these were only Coast∣ingWinds sweeping the Shore to about or Leagues in breadth from it and imagining that they had blown so all the  ea over between  America  and  Africa  and being confirm'd in this their Opinion by the  Portuguese  Pilots of the  European  Ships with whom several of my Officers conversed much and who were them∣selves as ignorant that these were only Coasting TradeWinds themselves going away before them in their return home∣wards till they cross the Line and so ha∣ving no experience of the Breadth of them being thus possess'd with a Conceit that we could not Sail from hence till  September  this made them still the more remiss in their Duties and very listless to the get∣ting Things in a readiness for our Depar∣ture However I was the more diligent my Self to have the Ship scrub'd and to send my WaterCasks ashore to get them trim'd my Beer being now out I went also to the Governor to get my Water fill'd sor here being but one Wateringplace and the Water running low now at the end of the Dry Season it was al∣ways so crouded with the  European  Ships Boats who were preparing to be gone that my Men could seldom come nigh it till the Governor very kindly sent an Of∣ficer to clear the Waterplace for my Men and to stay there till my WatesCasks were all full whom I satisfied sor his Pains Here I also got Aboard or Tun of Ballast and made my Boatswain fit the  Rigging that was amiss and I enquired also of my particular Officers whose Bu∣siness it was whether they wanted any Stores especially Pitch and Tar for that here I wou'd supply my self before I pro∣ceeded any farther but they say they had enough tho' it did not afterwards prove so  I commonly went ashore every day either upon Business or to recreate my self in the Fields which were very plea∣sant and the more for a shower of Rain now and then that ushers in the Wet Sea∣son Several sorts of good Fruits were al∣so still remaining especially Oranges which were in such plenty that I and all my Company stock'd our selves for our Voyage with them and they did us a great kindness and we took in also a good quantity of Rum and Sugar But for Fowls they being here lean and dear I was glad I had stockt my self at St  Jago  But by the little care my Officers took for fresh Provisions one might conclude they did not think of going much farther Be∣sides I had like to have been imbroiled with the Clergy here of the  Inquisition  as I suppose and so my Voyage might have been hindred What was said to them of me by some of my Company that went ashore I know not but I was assur'd by a Merchant there that if they got me into their Clutches and  it seems when I was last ashore they had narrowly watch'd me the Governor him∣self could not release me Besides I might either be murther'd in the Streets as he sent me word or Poysoned if I came a∣shore any more and therefore he advised me to stay aboard Indeed I had now no further Business ashore but to take leave of the Governor and therefore took his Ad∣vice  Our Stay here was till the d of  April  I would have gone before if I could sooner have fitted my self but was now earnest to be gone because this Harbour lies open to the S and S S W which are raging Winds here and now was the Season for them We had had two or three Touches of them and one pretty severe and the Ships ride there so near each other that if a Cable should fail or an Anchor start you are instantly aboard of one Ship or other and I was more afraid of being dis∣abled here in Harbour by these blustring Winds than discouraged by them as my People were from prosecuting the Voy∣age for at present I even wish'd for a brisk Southerly Wind as soon as I should be once well out of the Harbour to set me the sooner into the True General TradeWind  The Tide of Flood being spent and having a fine LandBreez on the d in  the Morning I went away from the An∣choringplace before 'twas light and then lay by till Daylight that we might see the better how to go out of the Harbour I had a Pilot belonging to Mr  Cock  who went out with me to whom I gave three Dollars but I found I could as well have gone out my Self by the Soundings I made at coming in The Wind was E by N and fair Weather By a Clock I was got past all danger and then sent away my Pilot At Cape  Salvadore  bore N di∣stant Leagues and we had the Winds between the E by N and S E a consi∣derable time so that we kept along near the Shore commonly in sight of it The Southerly Blasts had now left us again for they come at first in short Flurries and shift to other Points for or days sometimes before they are quite set in And we had uncertain Winds between Sea and LandBreezes and the CoastingTrade which was its self unsetled  The EasterlyWinds at present made me doubt I should not weather a great Shoal which lies in Lat between deg and deg S and runs a great way into the Sea directly from the Land Easterly Indeed the Weather was fair and conti∣nued so a good while so that I might the better avoid any Danger from it and if the Wind came to the Southward I knew  I could stretch off to Sea so that I jogg'd on couragiously The th of  April  we saw a small Brigantine under the Shore plying to the Southward We also saw many Men of Warbirds and Boobies and abundance of  Albicore  Fish Having still fair Weather small Gales and some Calms I had the opportunity of trying the Current which I found to set some∣times Northerly and sometimes Southerly and therefore knew I was still within the Verge of the Tides Being now in the Lat of the  Abrohlo  Shoals which I expected to meet with I sounded and had Water lessening from to and so to Fa∣thom but then it rose again to  c  all Coral Rocks Whilst we were on this Shoal which we crosst towards the further part of it from Land where it lay deep and so was not dangerous we caught a great many Fish with Hook and Line and by evening Amplitude we had deg min East Variation This was the th of  April  we were then in Lat deg min S and East Longitude from Cape  Salvadore  min On the th being then in Lat deg min S we had small Gales from the W N W to the W S W often shifting The th we had the Winds from W to S S E Squals and Rain and we saw some Dol∣phins and other Fish about us We were  now out of sight of Land and had been so or Days but the Wind's now hang∣ing in the South was an apparent Sign that we were still too nigh the Shore to receive the True General EastTrade as the Easterly Winds we had before shew'd that we were too far off the Land to have the Benefit of the Coasting SouthTrade and the faintness of both these Winds and their often shifting from the S S W to the S E with Squalls Rain and small Gales were a Confirmation of our being between the Verge of the S CoastingTrade and that of the True Trade which is here regularly S E  The third of  May  being in Lat deg min and Merid distance West from Cape  Salvadore  Miles the Variation was deg min We saw no Fowl but Shearwaters as our Seamen call them being a small black Fowl that sweep the Water as they fly and are much in the Seas that lie without either of the  Tropicks  they are not eaten We caught small Sharks each Foot Inches long and they were very good Food for us The next day we caught more Sharks of the same size and we eat them also esteem∣ing them as good Fish boil'd and presst and then stew'd with Vinegar and Pep∣per  We had nothing of Remark from the d of  May  to the th only now and then seeing a small Whale spouting up the Water We had the Wind Easterly and we ran with it to the Southward running in this time from the Lat of deg m to deg min S and having then d m E Long from C  Salvadore  the Va∣riation increasing upon us at present notwithstanding we went East We had all along a great difference between the Morning and Evening Amplitudes usual∣ly a degree or two and sometimes more We were now in the True Trade and therefore made good way to the South∣ward to get without the Verge of the General Trade Wind into a Westerly Wind's way that might carry us towards the Cape of  Good Hope  By the th of  May  being in Lat deg min we began to meet with Westerly Winds which freshned on us and did not leave us till a little before we made the Cape Some∣times it blew so hard that it put us under a forecourse especially in the Night but in the daytime we had commonly our Main Topsail rist We met with nothing of moment only we past by a dead Whale and saw millions as I may say of SeaFowls about the Carkass and as far round about it as we could see some Feeding and the rest flying about or sit∣ting  on the Water waiting to take their Turns We first discovered the Whale by the Fowls for indeed I did never see so many Fowls at once in my Life before their Numbers being inconceivably great They were of divers sorts in Bigness Shape and Colour Some were almost as big as Geese of a grey Colour with White Breasts and with such Bills Wings and Tails Some were  Pintado  Birds as big as Ducks and speckled Black and White Some were Shearwaters some Petrels and there were several sorts of large Fowls We saw of these Birds es∣pecially the  Pintado  birds all the Sea over from about Leagues distant from the Coast of  Brazil  to within much the same distance of  New Holland  The  Pintado  is a Southern Bird and of that Temperate Zone for I never saw of them much to the Norward of deg S The  Pintado  bird is as big as a Duck but appears as it flies about the bigness of a tame Pigeon having a short Tail but the Wings very long as most SeaFowls have especially such as these that fly far from the Shore and seldom come nigh it for their Rest∣ing is sitting afloat upon the Water but they lay I suppose ashore There are three sorts of these Birds all of the same make and bigness and are only different in Colour The first is black all over  The second sort are grey with white Bellies and Breasts The third sort which is the true  Pintado  or Paintedbird is cu∣riously spotted white and black Their Heads and the tips of their Wings and Tails are black for about an Inch and their Wings are also edg'd quite round with such a small black List only within the black on the tip of their Wings there is a white Spot seeming as they fly for then their Spots are best seen as big as a Halfcrown All this is on the outside of the Tails and Wings and as there is a white Spot in the black Tip of the Wings so there is in the middle of the Wings which is white a black Spot but this towards the Back of the Bird turns gradu∣ally to a dark grey The Back its self from the Head to the Tip of the Tail and the Edge of the Wings next to the Back are all overspotted with fine small round white and black Spots as big as a Silver Twopence and as close as they can stick one by another The Belly Thighs Sides and inner part of the Wings are of a light Grey These Birds of all these sorts fly many together never high but almost sweeping the Water We shot one a while after on the Water in a Calm and a Wa∣terSpaniel we had with us brought it in I have given a Picture of it See  Birds  Fig but it was so damaged that the Picture  depictions of birds  F This very much resembles the Guarauna described and figured by Piso P  F The Pintado Bird P  doth not shew it to advantage and its Spots are best seen when the Feathers are spread as it flies  The Petrel is a Bird not much unlike a Swallow but smaller and with a shorter Tail 'Tis all over black except a white Spot on the Rump They fly sweeping like Swallows and very near the Water They are not so often seen in fair Weather being Foulweather Birds as our Seamen call them and presaging a Storm when they come about a Ship who for that Reason don't love to see them In a Storm they will hover close under the Ship's Stern in the Wake of the Ship as 'tis call'd or the smoothness which the Ship's passing has made on the Sea and there as they fly gently then they pat the Water alter∣nately with their Feet as if they walkt upon it tho' still upon the Wing And from hence the Seamen give them the name of  Petrels  in allusion to St  Peter  's walking upon the Lake of  Gennesareth  We also saw many Bunches of Sea∣weeds in the Lat of and by Judg∣ment near the Meridian of the Island  Tri∣stian d'Aconha  and then we had about d min East Variation which was now again decreasing as we ran to the Eastward all near the Meridian of  Ascention  where we found little or no Variation But from thence as we ran farther to the East our Variation increased Westerly  Two days before I made the Cape of  G Hope  my Variation was deg min West I was then in deg min East Longit from C  Salvador  being in Lat deg min this was the first of  June  The second of  June  I saw a large black Fowl with a whitish flat Bill fly by us and took great notice of it because in the  EastIndia  Waggoner or Pilotbook there is mention made of large Fowls as big as Ravens with white flat Bills and black Feathers that fly not above Leagues from the  Cape  and are lookt on as a Sign of ones being near it My Reck∣oning made me then think my self above Leagues from the  Cape  according to the Longitude which the  Cape  hath in the com∣mon SeaCharts so that I was in some doubt whether these were the right Fowls spoken of in the Waggoner or whether those Fowls might not fly farther off Shore than is there mentioned or whe∣ther as it prov'd I might not be nearer the  Cape  than I reckoned my self to be for I found soon after that I was not then above or Leagues at most from the Cape Whether the fault were in the Charts laying down the  Cape  too much to the East from  Brazil  or were rather in our Reckoning I could not tell but our Reckonings are liable to such Uncertain∣ties from Steerage Log Currents Half  MinuteGlasses and sometimes want of Care as in so long a Run cause often a dif∣ference of many Leagues in the whole Ac∣count  Most of my Men that kept Journals im∣puted it to the HalfMinuteglasses and indeed we had not a good Glass in the Ship beside the Halfwatch or Two HourGlas∣ses As for our HalfMinuteGlasses we tried them all at several times and we found those that we had us'd from  Brazil  as much too short as others we had us'd before were too long which might well make great Errors in those several Reck∣onings A Ship ought therefore to have its Glasses very exact and besides an ex∣traordinary Care ought to be used in heav∣ing the Log for fear of giving too much StrayLine in a moderate Gale and also to stop quickly in a brisk Gale for when a Ship runs or Knots half a Knot or a Knot is soon run out and not heeded But to prevent danger when a Man thinks himself near Land the best way is to look out betimes and lie by in the Night for a Commander may err easily himself be∣side the Errors of those under him tho' never so carefully eyed  Another thing that stumbled me here was the  Variation  which at this time by the last Amplitude I had I found to be but  deg min W whereas the Variation  at the  Cape  from which I found my self not Leagues distant was then com∣puted and truly about Deg or more And yet a while after this when I was got Leagues to the Eastward of the  Cape  I found the Variation but Deg Min W whereas it should have been rather more than at the  Cape  These Things I con∣fess did puzzle me neither was I fully satisfied as to the Exactness of the taking the Variation at Sea For in a great Sea which we often meet with the Compass will traverse with the motion of the Ship besides the Ship may and will deviate some∣what in Steering even by the best Helms∣men And then when you come to take an  Azimuth  there is often some difference be∣tween him that looks at the Compass and the Man that takes the Altitude heighth of the Sun and a small Error in each if the Error of both should be one way will make it wide of any great Exactness But what was most shocking to me I found that the Variation did not always increase or decrease in proportion to the Degrees of Longitude East or West as I had a No∣tion they might do to a certain Number of Degrees of Variation East or West at such or such particular Meridians But finding in this Voyage that the Difference of Variation did not bear a regular pro∣portion to the difference of Longitude I  was much pleas'd to see it thus Observ'd in a Scheme shewn me after my Return home wherein are represented the several Vari∣ations in the  Atlantick  Sea on both sides the Equator and there the Line of no Variation in that Sea is not a Meridian Line but goes very oblique as do those also which shew the Increase of Variation on each side of it In that Draught there is so large an Advance made as well to∣wards the Accounting for those seemingly Irregular Increases and Decreases of Vari∣ation towards the S E Coast of  America  as towards the fixing a general Scheme or System of the Variation every where which would be of such great Use in Na∣vigation that I cannot but hope that the Ingenious Author Capt  Halley  who to his profound Skill in all Theories of these kinds hath added and is adding continu∣ally Personal Experiments will e'er long oblige the World with a fuller Discovery of the Course of the Variation which hath hitherto been a Secret For my part I pro∣fess my self unqualified for offering at any thing of a General Scheme but since Matter of Fact and whatever increases the History of the Variation may be of use towards the setling or confirming the Theory of it I shall here once for all in∣sert a  Table  of all the  Variations  I observ'd beyond the  Equator  in this Voyage both  in going out and returning back and what Errors there may be in it I shall leave to be Corrected by the Observations of Others  A Table of

the Winds hang∣ing Southerly I jog'd on to the Eastward to make the  Cape  On the third of  June  we saw a Sail to Leeward of us shewing  English  Colours I bore away to speak with her and found her to be the  Antelope  of  London  commanded by Captain  Ham∣mond  and bound for the Bay of  Bengal  in the Service of the  NewEastIndia  Compa∣ny There were many Passengers aboard going to settle there under Sir  Edward Lit∣tleton  who was going Chief thither I went aboard and was known by Sir  Ed∣ward  and Mr  Hedges  and kindly received and treated by them and the Commander who had been afraid of us before tho' I had sent one of my Officers aboard They had been in at the  Cape  and came from thence the Day before having stockt them∣selves with Refreshments They told me that they were by Reckoning Miles to the West of the  Cape  While I was aboard them a fine small Westerly Wind sprang up therefore I shortned my stay with them because I did not design to go in to the  Cape  When I took leave I was presented with half a Mutton Cabbages Pum∣kins Pound of Butter Couple of Stockfish and a quantity of Parsnips sending them some Oatmeal which they wanted  From my first setting out from  England  I did not design to touch at the  Cape  and that was one Reason why I touch'd at  Bra∣zil  that there I might refresh my Men and prepare them for a long Run to  New Holland  We had not yet seen the Land but about in the Afternoon we saw the  Cape  Land bearing East at above Leagues distance And Captain  Hammond  being also bound to double the  Cape  we jog'd on together this Afternoon and the next Day and had several fair Sights of it which may be seen  Table  III No  To proceed having still a Westerly Wind I jog'd on in company with the  Antelope  till Sunday  June  the th at in the Afternoon when we parted they steering away for the  EastIndies  and I keeping an E S E Course the better to make my way for  New Holland  For tho'  New Holland  lies NorthEasterly from the  Cape  yet all Ships bound towards that Coast or the Streights of  Sundy  ought to keep for a while in the same Parallel or in a Lat between and at least a little to the S of the East that they may continue in a variable Winds way and not venture too soon to stand so far to the North as to be within the verge of the TradeWind which will put them by their Easterly Course The Wind increased upon us but  we had yet sight of the  Antelope  and of the Land too till  Tuesday  the th of  June  And then we saw also by us an inumerable Company of Fowls of divers sorts so that we lookt about to see if there were not another dead Whale but saw none  The Night before the Sun set in a black Cloud which appeared just like Land and the Clouds above it were gilded of a dark red Colour And on the  Tuesday  as the Sun drew near the Horizon the Clouds were gilded very prettily to the Eye tho' at the same time my Mind dreaded the Conse∣quences of it When the Sun was now not above deg high it entered into a dark smoakycoloured Cloud that lay parallel with the Horizon from whence presently seem'd to issue many dusky blackish Beams The Sky was at this time covered with small hard Clouds as we call such as lie scattering about not likely to Rain very thick one by another and such of them as lay next to the Bank of Clouds at the Horizon were of a pure Gold colour to or deg high above the Bank From these to about deg high they were redder and very bright above them they were of a darker Colour still to about or deg high where the Clouds began to be of their common Colour I took the more particu∣lar Notice of all this because I have gene∣rally observed such colour'd Clouds to ap∣pear  before an approaching Storm And this being Winter here and the time for bad Weather I expected and provided for a violent Blast of Wind by riffing our Top∣sails and giving a strict charge to my Of∣ficers to hand them or take them in if the Wind should grow stronger The Wind was now at W N W a very brisk Gale About a Clock at Night we had a pale whitish Glare in the N W which was another Sign and intimated the Storm to be near at hand and the Wind increasing upon it we presently handed our Topsails furled the Mainsail and went away only with our Foresail Before in the Morn∣ing it came on very fierce and we kept right before Wind and Sea the Wind still increasing But the Ship was very govern∣able and Steer'd incomparably well At in the Morning we settled our ForeYard lowering it or Foot and we ran very swiftly especially when the Squals of Rain or Hail from a black Cloud came over head for then it blew excessive hard These tho' they did not last long yet came very thick and fast one after another The Sea also ran very high But we running so violently before Wind and Sea we Shipt little or no Water tho' a little washt into our upper DeckPorts and with it a Scuttle or CuttleFish was cast upon the Carriage of a Gun  The Wind blew extraordinary hard all  Wednesday  the th of  June  but abated of its fierceness before Night Yet it continu∣ed a brisk Gale till about the th and still a moderate one till the th Day by which time we had run about Leagues For the most part of which time the Wind was in some point of the West  viz  from the W N W to the S by W It blew hard∣est when at W or between the W and S W but after it veered more Southerly the foul Weather broke up This I observed at other times also in these Seas that when the Storms at West veered to the South∣ward they grew less and that when the Wind came to the E of the S we had still smaller Gales Calms and fair Wea∣ther As for the Westerly Winds on that side the  Cape  we like them never the worse for being violent for they drive us the faster to the Eastward and are therefore the only Winds coveted by those who sail towards such parts of the  EastIndies  as lie South of the Equator as  Timor Java  and  Sumatra  and by the Ships bound for  China  or any other that are to pass through the Streights of  Sundy  Those Ships having once past the  Cape  keep commonly pretty far Southerly on purpose to meet with these West Winds which in the Winter Season of these Climates they soon meet with for then the Winds are generally Westerly at  the  Cape  and especially to the Southward of it But in their Summer Months they get to the Southward of deg usually e'er they meet with the Westerly Winds I was not at this time in a higher Lat than deg min and oftentimes was more Northerly altering my Latitude often as Winds and Weather requir'd for in such long Runs 'tis best to shape ones Course ac∣cording to the Winds And if in Steering to the East we should be obliged to bear a little to the N or S of it 'tis no great matter for 'tis but Sailing or Points from the Wind when 'tis either Norther∣ly or Southerly and this not only easeth the Ship from straining but shortens the way more than if a Ship was kept close on a Wind as some Men are fond of doing  The th of  June  we were in Lat deg min S and Long from the  Cape  deg min E and had small Gales and Calms The Winds were at N E by E and continued in some part of the E till the th Day When it having been some time at N N E it came about at N and then to the W of the N and continu∣ed in the Westboard between the N N W and S S W till the th of  July  in which time we ran Miles then the Winds came about again to the East we reckoning our selves to be in a Meridian L East of that of the  Cape  and having fair Weather sounded but had no Ground  We met with little of Remark in this Voyage besides being accompanied with Fowles all the way especially PintadoBirds and seeing now and then a Whale But as we drew nigher the Coast of  NewHolland  we saw frequently or Whales together When we were about Leagues from the Land we began to see Seaweeds all of one sort and as we drew nigher the Shore we saw them more fre∣quently At about Leagues distance we began to see some Scutlebones floating on the Water and drawing still nigher the Land we saw greater quantities of them  July  the th being in Lat deg min S and Longitude E from the C of  G Hope  deg min we saw a large Gar∣fish leap times by us which seemed to be as big as a Porpose It was now very fair Weather and the Sea was full of a sort of very small Grass or Moss which as it floated in the Water seemed to have been some Spawn of Fish and there was among it some small Fry The next Day the Sea was full of small round things like Pearl some as big as white Peas they were very Clear and Transparent and upon crushing any of them a drop of Water would come forth The Skin that contained the Water was so thin that it was but just deseernable Some Weeds swam by us so that we did not doubt but we should quickly see Land  On the th also some Weeds swam by us and the Birds that had flown along with us all the way almost from  Brazil  now left us except only or Shearwaters On the th we saw many Weeds swim by us and some Whales blowing On the th we had dark cloudy Weather with much Thunder Lightning and vio∣lent Rains in the Morning But in the E∣vening it grew fair We saw this Day a Scutlebone swim by us and some of our young Men a Seal as it should seem by their Description of its Head I saw also some Boneta's and some Skipjacks a Fish about Inches long broad and sizable not much unlike a Roach which our Sea∣men call so from their leaping about  The th of  July  being still nearer the Land we saw abundance of Scutlebones and Seaweed more Tokens that we were not far from it and saw also a sort of Fowls the like of which we had not seen in the whole Voyage all the other Fowls ha∣ving now left us These were as big as Lapwings of a grey Colour black about their Eyes with red sharp Bills long Wings their Tails long and forked like Swallows and they flew flapping their Wings like Lapwings In the Afternoon we met with a Ripling like a Tide or Cur∣rent or the Water of some Shole or Over∣fal but were past it before we could sound  The Birds last mention'd and this were further Signs of Land In the Evening we had fair Weather and a small Gale at West At a Clock we sounded again but had no Ground  We kept on still to the Eastward with an easy Sail looking out sharp for by the many Signs we had I did expect that we were near the Land At a Clock in the Night I sounded and had Fa∣thom course Sand and small white Shells I presently clapt on a Wind and stood to the South with the Wind at W because I thought we were to the South of a Shoal call'd the  Abrohles  an Appellative Name for Shoals as it seems to me which in a Draught I had of that Coast is lay'd down in deg min Lat stretching about Leagues into the Sea I was the Day before in deg min by Reckoning And afterwards steering E by S purposely to avoid it I thought I must have been to the South of it but sounding again at One a Clock in the Morning  Aug  the first we had but Fathom CoralRocks and so found the Shoal was to the South of us We presently tackt again and stood to the North and then soon deepned our Water for at two in the Morning we had Fathom Coral still At three we had Coralground At we had Fa∣thom course Sand with some Coral At  depictions of New Holland

laid down wrong in my SeaChart for I found it lie in about deg Lat and by our Run in the next day I found that the Outwardedge of it which I sounded on lies Leagues off Shore When it was day we steered in E N E with a fine brisk Gale but did not see the Land till in the Morning when we saw it from our Topmasthead and were distant from it about Leagues having then Fathomwater and clean Sand About Hours after we saw it on our QuarterDeck being by Judgment about Leagues off and we had then Fa∣thom clean Sand As we ran in this day and the next we took several Sights of it at different Bearings and Distances from which it appear'd as you see in  Ta∣ble  IV N  o  And here I would Note once for all That the Lati∣tudes mark'd in the Draughts or Sights here given are not the Latitude of the Land but of the Ship when the Sight was taken This Morning  August  the first as we were standing in we saw several large Seafowls like our Gannets on the Coast of  England  flying three or four to∣gether  and a sort of white SeaMews but black about the Eyes and with forked Tails We strove to run in near the Shore to seek for a Harbour to refresh us after our tedious Voyage having made one continued stretch from  Brazil  hither of a∣bout Deg designing from hence al∣so to begin the Discovery I had a mind to make on  N Holland  and  N Guinea  The Land was low and appear'd even and as we drew nearer to it it made as you see in  Table  IV N  o  with some red and some white Clifts these last in Lat S where you will find Fathom within four Miles of the Shore  About the Lat of deg S we saw an Opening and ran in hoping to find a Harbour there but when we came to its Mouth which was about two Leagues wide we saw Rocks and foul Ground within and therefore stood out again There we had Fathomwater within two mile of the Shore The Land every where appear'd pretty low flat and even but with steep Cliffs to the Sea and when we came near it there were no Trees Shrubs or Grass to be seen The Sound∣ings in the Lat of deg S from about or Leagues off till you come within a League of the Shore are generally about Fathom differing but little seldom above three or four Fathom But the  Lead brings up very different sorts of Sand some course some fine and of se∣veral Colours as Yellow White Grey Brown Bluish and Reddish  When I saw there was no Harbour here nor good Anchoring I stood off to Sea a∣gain in the Evening of the second of  Au∣gust  fearing a Storm on a Leeshore in a place where there was no shelter and de∣siring at least to have SeaRoom For the Clouds began to grow thick in the West∣ernboard and the Wind was already there and began to blow fresh almost upon the Shore which at this Place lies along N N W and S S E By Nine a Clock at Night we had got a pretty good Offin but the Wind still increasing I took in my Main Topsail being able to carry no more Sail than two Courses and the Mizen At two in the Morning  Aug  it blew very hard and the Sea was much raised so that I furled all my Sails but my Mainsail Tho' the Wind blew so hard we had yet pretty clear Weather till Noon But then the whole Sky was blackned with thick Clouds and we had some Rain which would last a quarter of an hour at a time and then it would blow very fierce while the Squals of Rain were over our Heads but as soon as they were gone the Wind was by much abated the stress of the Storm being over We sound∣ed  several times but had no Ground till a Clock  Aug  the th in the Evening and then had Fathomwater Coral∣ground At Ten we had Fathom fine Sand At Twelve we had Fathom fine Sand of a pale bluish Colour It was now pretty moderate Weather yet I made no Sail till Morning but then the Wind veering about to the S W I made Sail and stood to the North And at a Clock the next day  Aug  we saw Land again at about Leagues di∣stance This Noon we were in Lat deg min and in the Afternoon our Cook died an Old Man who had been sick a great while being infirm before we came out of  England  The th of  August  in the Morning we saw an Opening in the Land and we ran in to it and anchored in seven and a half Fathomwater miles from the Shore clean Sand It was somewhat difficult getting in here by reason of many Shoals we met with But I sent my Boat sound∣ing before me The Mouth of this Sound which I call'd  Shark  's  Bay  lies in about deg S Lat and our Reckoning made its Longitude from the C of  Good Hope  to be about Degrees which is less by Leagues than is usually laid down in our common Draughts if our Reckoning was right and our Glasses did not deceive  us As soon as I came to anchor in this Bay of which I have given a Plan Table IV N  o  I sent my Boat ashore to seek for fresh Water But in the Evening my Men returned having found none The next morning I went ashore my self carrying Pickaxes and Shovels with me to dig for Water and Axes to cut Wood We tried in several places for Water but finding none after several Trials nor in several miles compass we left any farther search for it and spending the rest of the day in cutting Wood we went aboard at Night  The Land is of an indifferent heighth so that it may be seen or Leagues off It appears at a distance very even but as you come nigher you find there are many gentle Risings tho' none steep nor high 'Tis all a steep Shore against the open Sea but in this Bay or Sound we were now in the Land is low by the Seaside ri∣sing gradually in within the Land The Mould is Sand by the Seaside producing a large sort of Sampier which bears a white Flower Farther in the Mould is reddish a sort of Sand producing some Grass Plants and Shrubs The Grass grows in great Tufts as big as a Bushel here and there a Tuft being intermix'd with much Heath much of the kind we have growing on our Commons in  Eng∣land  Of Trees or Shrubs here are divers sorts but none above ten Foot high Their Bodies about Foot about and or Foot high before you come to the Branches which are bushy and compos'd of small Twigs there spreading abroad tho' thick set and full of Leaves which were mostly long and narrow The Co∣lour of the Leaves was on one side Whi∣tish and on the other Green and the Bark of the Trees was generally of the same Colour with the Leaves of a pale Green Some of these Trees were sweet∣scented and reddish within the Bark like Sassafras but redder Most of the Trees and Shrubs had at this time either Blos∣soms or Berries on them The Blossoms of the different sort of Trees were of several Colours as Red White Yellow  c  but mostly Blue and these generally smelt very sweet and fragrant as did some also of the rest There were also beside some Plants Herbs and tall Flowers some ve∣ry small Flowers growing on the Ground that were sweet and beautiful and for the most part unlike any I had seen else∣where  There were but few LandFowls we saw none but Eagles of the larger sorts of Birds but or sorts of small Birds The biggest sort of these were not bigger than Larks some no bigger than Wrens all  depictions of birds  F The head greatest part of y  e  neck of this bird is red therein differs from the Avosetta of Italy  F A noddy of N Holland P  F A Comon Noddy P  F The Bill Leggs of this Bird are of a Bright R  singing with great variety of fine shrill Notes and we saw some of their Nests with young Ones in them The WaterFowls are Ducks which had young Ones now this being the beginning of the Spring in these Parts Curlews Galdens Crab∣catchers Cormorants Gulls Pelicans and some WaterFowl such as I have not seen any where besides I have given the Pictures of several Birds on this Coast See  Birds  Fig  The LandAnimals that we saw here were only a sort of Raccoons different from those of the  WestIndies  chiefly as to their Legs for these have very short fore Legs but go Jumping upon them as the others do and like them are very good Meat and a sort of Guano's of the same shape and size with other Guano's describ'd Vol I p but differing from them in three remarkable Particu∣lars For these had a larger and uglier Head and had no Tail And at the Rump instead of the Tail there they had a stump of a Tail which appear'd like another Head but not really such being without Mouth or Eyes Yet this Crea∣ture seem'd by this means to have a Head at each end and which may be reckon'd a fourth difference the Legs also seem'd all four of them to be Forelegs being all a∣like in shape and length and seeming by  the Joints and Bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently either Head or Tail foremost They were speckled black and yellow like Toads and had Scales or Knobs on their Backs like those of Crocodiles plated on to the Skin or stuck into it as part of the Skin They are ve∣ry slow in motion and when a Man comes nigh them they will stand still and hiss not endeavouring to get away Their Livers are also spotted black and yellow and the Body when opened hath a very unsavory Smell I did never see such ugly Creatures any where but here The Guano's I have observ'd to be very good Meat and I have often eaten of them with pleasure But tho' I have eaten of Snakes Crocodiles and Allegators and many Creatures that look frightfully e∣nough and there are but few I should have been afraid to eat of if prest by Hun∣ger yet I think my Stomach would scarce have serv'd to venture upon these  N Hol∣land  Guano's both the Looks and the Smell of them being so offensive  The Seafish that we saw here for here was no River Land or Pond of Fresh Wa∣ter to be seen are chiefly Sharks There are abundance of them in this particular Sound that I therefore gave it the Name of  Shark  's  Bay  Here are also Skates Thornbacks and other Fish of the Ray  kind one sort especially like the SeaDevil and Garfish Boneta's  c  Of Shellfish we got here Muscles Periwink∣les Limpits Oysters both of the Pearl∣kind and also EatingOysters as well the common sort as long Oysters beside Cockles  c  The Shore was lined thick with many other sorts of very strange and beautiful Shells for variety of Colour and Shape most finely spotted with Red Black or Yellow  c  such as I have not seen any where but at this place I brought away a great many of them but lost all except a very few and those not of the best  There are also some green Turtle weigh∣ing about lb Of these we caught which the Water Ebbing had left behind a Ledge of Rock which they could not creep over These served all my Company Days and they were indifferent sweet Meat Of the Sharks we caught a great many which our Men eat very savourily Among them we caught one which was Foot long The space between its Eyes was Inches and Inches from one Corner of his Mouth to the other Its Maw was like a Leather Sack very thick and so tough that a sharp Knife could scarce cut it In which we found the Head and Boans of a  Hippopotomus  the hairy Lips of which were still sound and not putrified  and the Jaw was also firm out of which we pluckt a great many Teeth of them Inches long and as big as a Mans Thumb small at one end and a little crooked the rest not above half so long The Maw was full of Jelly which stank extreamly However I saved for a while the Teeth and the Sharks Jaw The Flesh of it was divi∣ded among my Men and they took care that no waste should be made of it  'Twas the th of  August  when we came into  Shark  'sBay in which we Anchor'd at three several Places and stay'd at the first of them on the W side of the Bay till the th During which time we search∣ed about as I said for fresh Water digging Wells but to no purpose How∣ever we cut good store of Firewood at this first Anchoringplace and my Com∣pany were all here very well refreshed with Raccoons Turtle Shark and other Fish and some Fowles so that we were now all much brisker than when we came in hi∣ther Yet still I was for standing farther into the Bay partly because I had a Mind to increase my stock of fresh Water which was began to be low and partly for the sake of Discovering this part of the Coast I was invited to go further by seeing from this Anchoringplace all open before me  which therefore I designed to search befor  I left the Bay So on the th about Noon  I steer'd farther in with an easie Sail be∣cause we had but shallow Water We kept therefore good looking out for fear of Sholes sometimes shortning sometimes deepning the Water About in the Afternoon we saw the Land a Head that makes the S of the Bay and before Night we had again Sholdings from that Shore And therefore shortned Sail and stood off and on all Night under Topsails conti∣nually sounding having never more then Fathom and seldom less than The Water deepned and sholdned so very gent∣ly that in heaving the Lead or times we should scarce have a Foot difference When we came into Fathom either way we presently went about From this S part of the Bay we could not see the Land from whence we came in the Afternoon And this Land we found to be an Island of or Leagues long as is seen in the Plain Ta∣ble IV No but it appearing barren I did not strive to go nearer it and the ra∣ther because the Winds would not permit us to do it without much Trouble and at the Openings the Water was generally Shole I therefore made no farther attempts in this S W and S part of the Bay but steered away to the Eastward to see if there was any Land that way for as yet we had seen none there On the th in the Morning we pass'd by the N Point of  that Land and were confirm'd in the Per∣suasion of its being an Island by seeing an Opening to the East of it as we had done on the W Having fair Weather a small Gale and smooth Water we stood further on in the Bay to see what Land was on the E of it Our Soundings at first were Fathom which held so a great while but at length it decreas'd to Then we saw the Land right ahead that in the Plan makes the E of the Bay We could not come near it with the Ship hav∣ing but Shole water and it being dange∣rous lying there and the Land extraordi∣narily low very unlikely to have fresh Water though it had a few Trees on it seemingly Mangroves and much of it pro∣bably covered at Highwater I stood out again that Afternoon deepning the Water and before Night anchored in Fathom clean white Sand about the middle of the Bay The next day we got up our An∣chor and that Afternoon came to an An∣chor once more near two Islands and a Shole of Corral Rocks that face the Bay Here I scrubb'd my Ship and finding it very improbable I should get any thing further here I made the best of my way out to Sea again sounding all the way but finding by the shallowness of the Wa∣ter that there was no going out to Sea to the East of the two Islands that face the  Bay nor between them I return'd to the West Entrance going out by the same Way I came in at only on the East instead of the Westside of the small Shole to be seen in the Plan in which Channel we had and Fathomwater still deep∣ning upon us till we were out at Sea The day before we came out I sent a Boat a∣shore to the most Northerly of the Two Islands which is the least of them catch∣ing many small Fish in the mean while with Hook and Line The Boat's Crew returning told me That the Ifle produces nothing but a sort of green short hard prickly Grass affording neither Wood nor fresh Water and that a Sea broak between the two Islands a Sign that the Water was shallow They saw a large Turtle and many Skates and Thornbacks but caught none  It was  August  the th when I sail'd out of this Bay or Sound the Mouth of which lies as I said in deg min designing to coast along to the N E till I might commodiously put in at some other part of  N Holland  In passing out we saw three WaterSerpents swimming about in the Sea of a yellow Colour spotted with dark brown Spots They were each a∣bout four Foot long and about the big∣ness of a Man's Wrist and were the first I saw on this Coast which abounds with  several sorts of them We had the Winds at our first coming out at N and the Land lying NorthEasterly We plied off and on getting forward but little till the next day When the Wind coming at S S W and S we began to Coast it along the Shore to the Northward keeping at or Leagues off Shore and sounding often we had between and Fathomwater brown Sand with some white Shells This th of  August  we were in Lat deg min On the th Day at Noon we were in deg min The Wind com∣ing at E by N we could not keep the Shore aboard but were forced to go far∣ther off and lost sight of the Land Then sounding we had no Ground with Fa∣thomline however the Wind shortly af∣ter came about again to the Southward and then we jogg'd on again to the North∣ward and saw many small Dolphins and Whales and abundance of Scuttleshells swimming on the Sea and some Water∣snakes every day The th we saw the Land again and took a Sight of it See Table IV N  o    The th in the Afternoon being or Leagues off Shore I saw a Shole point stretching from the Land into the Sea a League or more The Sea broke high on it by which I saw plainly there was a Shole there I stood farther off and coast∣ed  along Shore to about or Leagues distance And at a Clock at Night we sounded and had but Fathom hard Sand By this I found I was upon ano∣ther Shole and so presently steered off W half an hour and had then Fathom At One in the Morning of the th day we had Fathom By Two we could find no Ground and then I ventur'd to steer along Shore again due N which is two Points wide of the Coast that lies here N N E for fear of another Shole I would not be too far off from the Land being desirous to search into it whereever I should find an Opening or any Conveni∣ence of searching about for Water  c  When we were off the Sholepoint I men∣tion'd where we had but Fathomwa∣ter we had in the Night abundance of Whales about the Ship some a head o∣thers a stern and some on each side blow∣ing and making a very dismal Noise but when we came out again into deeper Wa∣ter they left us Indeed the Noise that they made by blowing and dashing of the Sea with their Tails making it all of a Breach and Fome was very dreadful to us like the breach of the Waves in very Sholewater or among Rocks The Shole these Whales were upon had depth of Water sufficient no less than twenty Fathom as I said and it lies in Lat  deg min The Shore was generally bold all along we had met with no Shole at Sea since the  Abrohlo  shole when we first fell on the  N Holland  Coast in the Lat of till yesterday in the Afternoon and this Night This Morning also when we expected by the Draught we had with us to have been Leagues off Shore we were but so that either our Draughts were faulty which yet hitherto and after∣wards we found true enough as to the ly∣ing of the Coast or else here was a Tide unknown to us that deceived us tho' we had found very little of any Tide on this Coast hitherto As to our Winds in the Coasting thus far we had been within the Verge of the General Trade tho' inter∣rupted by the Storm I mention'd from the Lat of when we first fell in with the Coast and by that time we were in the Lat of we had usually the regular Tradewind which is here S S E when we were at any distance srom Shore but we had often Sea and LandBreezes espe∣cially when near Shore and when in  Sharks bay  and had a particular N West Wind or Storm that set us in thither On this th of  August  we coasted with a brisk Gale of the True Tradewind at S S E very sair and clear VVeather but haling off in the Evening to Sea were next Morning out of sight of Land and the  Land now trending away N Easterly and we being to the Norward of it and the Wind also shrinking from the S S E to the E S E that is from the True TradeWind to the SeaBreeze as the Land now lay we could not get in with the Land again yet awhile so as to see it tho' we trim'd sharp and kept close on a Wind We were this th day in Lat  deg min The th we were in Lat deg min and kept close on a Wind to get sight of the Land again but could not yet see it We had very fair Weather and tho' we were so far from the Land as to be out of sight of it yet we had the Sea and LandBreezes In the Night we had the Landbreeze at S S E a small gentle Gale which in the Morn∣ing about Sunrising would shift about gradually and withal increasing in Strength till about Noon we should have it at E S E which is the true Seabreeze here Then it would blow a brisk Gale so that we could scarce carry our Top sails double rift and it would continue thus till in the Afternoon when it would decrease again The Weather was fair all the while not a Cloud to be seen but very hazy especially nigh the Horizon We sounded several times this th day and at first had no Ground but had after∣wards from to Fathom course  brown Sand mixt with small brown and white Stones with Dints besides in the Tallow  The st day also we had small Land∣breezes in the Night and Seabreezes in the day and as we saw some Seasnakes every day so this day we saw a great ma∣ny of two different sorts or shapes One sort was yellow and about the bigness of a Man's Wrist about Foot long hav∣ing a flat Tail about Fingers broad The other sort was much smaller and shorter round and spotted black and yel∣low This day we sounded several times and had Fathom Sand We did not make the Land till Noon and then saw it first from our Topmasthead It bore SE by E about Leagues distance and it appeared like a Cape or Head of Land The Seabreeze this day was not so strong as the day before and it veered out more so that we had a fair Wind to run in with to the Shore and at Sunset anchored in Fathom clean Sand about Leagues from the bluff Point which was not a Cape as it appear'd at a great distance but the Eastermost end of an Island about or Leagues in length and one in breadth There were or Rocky Islands about a I cague from us between us and the bluff Point and we saw many other Islands both to the East and VVest of it as  far as we could see either way from our Topmast head And all within them to the S there was nothing but Islands of a pretty heighth that may be seen or Leagues off By what we saw of them they must have been a Range of Islands of about Leagues in length stretching from E N E to VV S VV and for ought I know as far as to those of  SharksBay  and to a considerable breadth also for we could see or Leagues in a∣mong them towards the Continent or main Land of  N Holland  if there be any such thing hereabouts and by the great Tides I met with awhile afterwards more to the N East I had a strong suspicion that here might be a kind of  Archipelago  of Islands and a Passage possibly to the S of  N Holland  and  N Guinea  into the great  S Sea  Eastward which I had Thoughts also of attempting in my Return from  N Guinea  had Circumstances permitted and told my Officers so but I would not at∣tempt it at this time because we wanted VVater and could not depend upon find∣ing it there This Place is in the Lat of deg min but in the Draught that I had of this Coast which was  Tasman  's it was laid down in deg min and the Shore is laid down as all along joining in one Body or Continent with some Openings appearing like Rivers and not  like Islands as really they are See several Sights of it Table IV N  o  This Place therefore lies more Northerly by min than is laid down in Mr  Tasman  's Draught And beside its being made a firm continued Land only with some Openings like the Mouths of Rivers I sound the Soundings also different from what the prickt Line of his Course shews them and generally shallower than he makes them which inclines me to think that he came not so near the Shore as his Line shews and so had deeper Soundings and could not so well distinguish the Islands His Meridian or Difference of Longitude from  SharksBay  agrees well enough with my Account which is Leagues tho' we differ in Lat And to confirm my Conje∣cture that the Line of his Course is made too near the Shore at least not far to the East of this place the VVater is there so shallow that he could not come there so nigh  But to proceed in the Night we had a small Landbreeze and in the Morning I weighed Anchor designing to run in a∣mong the Islands for they had large Chan∣nels between them of a League wide at least and some or Leagues wide I sent in my Boat before to sound and if they sound Sholewater to return again but if they sound Water enough to go a∣shore  on one of the Islands and stay till the Ship came in where they might in the mean time search for Water So we followed after with the Ship sounding as we went in and had Fathom till with∣in Leagues of the Bluffhead and then we had shole Water and very uncertain Soundings Yet we ran in still with an ea∣sie Sail sounding and looking out well for this was dangerous Work When we came abreast of the Bluffhead and about Mile from it we had but Fathom Then we Edged away from it but had no more Water and running in a little further we had but Fathoms So we Anchored immediately and yet when we had veered out a third of a Cable we had Fathom Water again so uncertain was the Water My Boat came immediately aboard and told me that the Island was ve∣ry Rocky and Dry and they had little hopes of finding Water there I sent them to sound and bad them if they found a Channel of or Fathom Water to keep on and we would follow with the Ship We were now about Leagues within the outer small Rocky Islands but still could see nothing but Islands within us some or Leagues long others not above a Mile round The large Islands were pretty high but all appeared Dry and mostly Rocky and Barren The Rocks look'd of  a rusty yellow Colour and therefore I dispair'd of getting Water on any of them but was in some hopes of finding a Channel to run in beyond all these Islands could I have spent time here and either get to the Main of  New Holland  or find out some o∣ther Islands that might afford us Water and other Refreshments Besides that among so many Islands we might have found some sort of Rich Mineral or Ambergreese it being a good Latitude for both these But we had not Sailed above a League far∣ther before our Water grew sholer again and then we Anchored in Fathom hard Sand  We were now on the inner side of the Island on whose outside is the Bluffpoint We rode a League from the Island and I presently went ashore and carried Shovels to dig for Water but found none There grow here or sorts of Shrubs one just like Rosemary and therefore I call'd this  Rosemary  Island It grew in great plenty here but had no smell Some of the o∣ther Shrubs had blue and yellow Flowers and we found sorts of Grain like Beans The one grew on Bushes the other on a sort of a creeping Vine that runs along on the Ground having very thick broad Leaves and the Blossom like a Bean Blos∣som but much larger and of a deep red Colour looking very Beautiful We saw  here some Cormorants Gulls Crabcatch∣ers  c  a few small Land Birds and a sort of white Parrots which flew a great many together We found some Shell∣fish  viz  Limpits Perriwinkles and a∣bundance of small Oysters growing on the Rocks which were very sweet In the Sea we saw some green Turtle a pretty many Sharks and abundance of WaterSnakes of several sorts and sizes The Stones were all of rusty Colour and Pon∣derous  We saw a Smoak on an Island or Leagues off and here also the Bushes had been burned but we found no other sign of Inhabitants 'T was probable that on the Island where the Smoke was there were Inhabitants and fresh Water for them In the Evening I went aboard and consult∣ed with my Officers whether it was best to send thither or to search among any o∣ther of these Islands with my Boat or else go from hence and Coast along Shore with the Ship till we could find some bet∣ter Place than this was to ride in where we had shole Water and lay expos'd to Winds and Tides They all agreed to go from hence so I gave Orders to weigh in the Morning as soon as it should be light and to get out with the Landbreeze  Accordingly  August  the d at in the Morning we ran out having a pretty  fresh Landbreeze at S S E By a Clock we were got out and very seasonably for before the Seabreeze came on us very strong and increasing we took in our Topsails and stood off under Courses and a Mizan this being as much Sail as we could carry The sky was clear there being not one Cloud to be seen but the Horizon appeared very hazy and the Sun at setting the Night before and this Morning at ri∣sing appeared very Red The Wind con∣tinued very strong till Twelve then it be∣gan to abate I have seldom met with a stronger Breeze These strong Seabreezes lasted thus in their Turns or Days They sprung up with the Sun rise By a Clock they were very strong and so con∣tinued till Noon when they began to a∣bate And by Sunset there was little Wind or a Calm till the Landbreezes came which we should certainly have in the Morning about or a Clock The Landbreezes were between the S S W and S S E The Seabreezes between the E N E and N N E In the Night while Calm we fish'd with Hook and Line and caught good store of Fish  viz  Snappers Breams Old Wives and Dogfish When these last came we seldom caught any others for if they did not drive away the other Fish yet they would be sure to keep them from taking our Hooks for they would  depictions of fish  Plate  F A Fish taken on the Coast of New Holland  F A Cuttle taken near N Holland  F A Flying Fish taken

 Fig I  On the th of  August  we still Coasted along Shore that we might the better see any Opening kept sounding and had a∣bout Fathom clean Sand The th Day being about Leagues off Shore the Water began gradually to sholden from to Fathom I was Edging in a little towards the Land thinking to have Anchored But presently after the Water decreased almost at once till we had but Fathom I durst therefore adventure no farther but steered out the same way that we came in and in a short time had Fathom being then about Leagues and a half from the Shore and even Sound∣ings I steered away E N E Coasting along as the Land lies This Day the Sea∣breezes began to be very moderate again and we made the best of our way along Shore only in the Night Edging off a lit∣tle for fear of Sholes Ever since we left  SharksBay  we had had fair clear Weather and so for a great while still  The th Day we had Fathom Wa∣ter all Night yet we could not see Land till in the Afternoon from our Topmasthead By we could just discern Land from our Quarterdeck We had then  Fathom The Wind was at N and we steered E by N which is but one point in on the Land Yet we decreased our Water very fast for at we had but Fathom the next Cast but which frighted us and we then tackt instantly and stood off But in a short time the Wind coming at N W and W N W we tackt again and steered N N E and then deepned our Water a∣gain and had all Night from to Fa∣thom  The th Day we had between and Fathom We saw no Land this Day but saw a great many Snakes and some Whales We saw also some  Boobies  and Noddybirds and in the Night caught one of these last It was of another Shape and Colour than any I had seen before It had a small long Bill as all of them have flat Feet like Ducks Feet its Tail forked like a Swallow but longer and broader and the Fork deeper than that of the Swal∣low with very long Wings The Top or Crown of the Head of this Noddy was Coalblack having also small black Streaks round about and close to the Eyes and round these Streaks on each side a pretty broad white Circle The Breast Belly and under part of the Wings of this Nod∣dy were white And the Back and upper part of its Wings of a saint black or smoak Colour See a Picture of this and of the  Common one  Birds Fig  Noddies are seen in most Places between the  Tropicks  as well in the  EastIndies  and on the Coast of  Brazil  as in the  WestIndies  They rest a Shore a Nights and therefore we never see them far at Sea not above or Leagues unless driven off in a Storm When they come about a Ship they com∣monly perch in the Night and will sit still till they are taken by the Seamen They Build on Cliffs against the Sea or Rocks as I have said Vol I p  The th Day being in Lat deg min we made the Land again and saw many great Smoaks near the Shore and having fair Weather and moderate Breezes I steered in towards it At in the After∣noon I Anchored in Fathom Water clear Sand about Leagues and a half from the Shore I presently sent my Boat to Sound nearer in and they found Fa∣thom about a Mile farther in and from thence still farther in the Water decreased gradually to and at Mile distance to Fathom This Evening we saw an Eclipse of the Moon but it was abating before the Moon appear'd to us for the Horizon was very hazy so that we could not see the Moon till she had been half an hour above the Horizon and at two hours min after Sunset by the reck∣oning of our Glasses the Eclipse was quite  gone which was not of many Digits The Moon's Center was then deg min high  The st of  August  betimes in the Morn∣ing I went ashore with or Men to search for Water We went armed with Muskets and Cutlasses for our Defence ex∣pecting to see People there and carried also Shovels and Pickaxes to dig Wells When we came near the Shore we saw tall black naked Men on the sandy Bay a∣head of us But as we row'd in they went away When we were landed I sent the Boat with two Men in her to ly a little from the Shore at an Anchor to prevent being seiz'd while the rest of us went af∣ter the black Men who were now got on the top of a small Hill about a quarter of a Mile from us with or Men more in their Company They seeing us com∣ing ran away When we came on the top of the Hill where they first stood we saw a plain Savannah about half a mile from us farther in from the Sea There were several Things like Haycocks standing in the Savannah which at a di∣stance we thought were Houses looking just like the  Hottentot  's Houses at the  Cap  of G Hope  but we found them to be s  many Rocks We searched about thes  for Water but could find none nor an  Houses nor People for they were a  Then we return'd again to the Place where we landed and there we dug for Water  While we were at work there came or of the Natives to a small Hill a little way from us and stood there menacing and threatning of us and making a great Noise At last one of them came towards us and the rest followed at a distance I went out to meet him and came within yards of him making to him all the Signs of Peace and Friendship I could but then he ran away neither would they any of them stay for us to come nigh them for we tried two or three times At last I took two Men with me and went in the Afternoon along by the Sea∣side purposely to catch one of them if I could of whom I might learn where they got their fresh Water There were or of the Natives a little way off who seeing us three going away from the rest of our Men followed us at a distance I thought they would follow us but there being for a while a Sandbank between us and them that they could not then see us we made a halt and hid our selves in a bending of the Sandbank They knew we must be thereabouts and being or times our Number thought to seize us So they dispers'd themselves some going to the Seashore and others beating about  the Sandhills We knew by what Ren∣counter we had had with them in the Morning that we could easily outrun them so a nimble young Man that was with me seeing some of them near ran towards them and they for some time ran away besore him But he soon over∣taking them they fac'd about and fought him He had a Cutlass and they had Wooden Lances with which being ma∣ny of them they were too hard for him When he first ran towards them I chas'd two more that were by the Shore but fearing how it might be with my young Man I turn'd back quickly and went up to the top of a Sandhill whence I saw him near me closely engag'd with them Upon their seeing me one of them threw a Lance at me that narrowly misst me I discharg'd my Gun to scare them but avoided shooting any of them till finding the young Man in great danger from them and my self in some and that tho' the Gun had a little frighted them at first yet they had soon learnt to despise it tossing up their Hands and crying  Pooh Pooh Pooh  and coming on afresh with a great Noise I thought it high time to charge a∣gain and shoot one of them which I did The rest seeing him fall made a stand a∣gain and my young Man took the op∣portunity to disengage himself and come  off to me my other Man also was with me who had done nothing all this while having come out unarm'd and I return'd back with my Men designing to attempt the Natives no farther being very sorry for what had happen'd already They took up their wounded Companion and my young Man who had been struck through the Cheek by one of their Lances was afraid it had been poison'd but I did not think that likely His Wound was very painful to him being made with a blunt Weapon but he soon recover'd of it  Among the  N Hollanders  whom we were thus engag'd with there was one who by his Appearance and Carriage as well in the Morning as this Afternoon seem'd to be the Chief of them and a kind of Prince or Captain among them He was a young brisk Man not very tall nor so pe  sonable as some of the rest tho' more  and couragious He was painted which none of the rest were at all with a Circle of white Paste or Pigment a sort  ime as we thought about his Eyes and a white streak down his Nose from his Forehead to the tip of it And his Breast and some part of his Arms were also made white with the same Paint not for Beauty or Ornament one would think but as some wild  Indian  Warriors are said to do he  seem'd thereby to design the looking more terrible this his Painting adding very much to his natural Deformity for they all of them of the most unpleasant Looks and the worst Features of any People that ever I saw tho' I have seen great variety of Savages These  N Hollanders  were probably the same sort of People as those I met with on this Coast in my  Voyage round the World  See Vol I p  c  for the Place I then touch'd at was not a∣bove or Leagues to the N E of this And these were much the same blinking Creatures here being also abundance of the same kind of Fleshflies teizing them and with the same black Skins and Hair frizled tall and thin  c  as those were But we had not the opportunity to see whether these as the former wanted two of their foreTeeth  We saw a great many places where they had made Fires and where there were commonly or Boughs stuck up to Windward of them for the Wind which is the Seabreeze in the daytime blows always one way with them and the Landbreeze is but small By their Fireplaces we should always find great heaps of Fish∣shells of seueral sorts and 'tis probable that these poor Creatures here lived chiefly on the Shellfish as those I before describ'd did on small Fish which they caught in  Wires or Holes in the Sand at Lowwater These gather'd their Shellfish on the Rocks at Lowwater but had no Wires that we saw whereby to get any other sorts of Fish As among the former I saw not any heaps of Shells as here though I know they also gather'd some Shellfish The Lances also of those were such as these had however they being upon an Island with their Women and Children and all in our Power they did not there use them against us as here on the Continent where we saw none but some of the Men under Head who come out purposely to observe us We saw no Houses at either Place and I believe they have none since the for∣mer People on the Island had none tho' they had all their Families with them  Upon returning to my Men I saw that tho' they had dug or Foot deep yet found no Water So I returned aboard that Evening and the next day being  September  st I sent my Boatswain ashore to dig deeper and sent the Sain with him to catch Fish While I staid aboard I ob∣served the flowing of the Tide which runs very swift here so that our Nunbuoy would not bear above the Water to be seen It flows here as on that part of  N Holland  I describ'd formerly about Fathom and here the Flood runs S E by S till the last Quarter then it sets  right in towards the Shore which lies here S S W and N N E and the Ebb runs N W by N When the Tides slackned we Fish'd with Hook and Line as we had already done in several Places on this Coast on which in this Voyage hi∣therto we had found but little Tides but by the Heighth and Strength and Course of them hereabouts it should seem that if there be such a Passage or Streight going through Eastward to the Great  South Sea  as I said one might suspect one would ex∣pect to find the Mouth of it somewhere between this Place and  Rosemary  Island which was the part of  N Holland  I come last from  Next Morning my Men came aboard and brought a Rundlet of brackish Water which they got out of another Well that they dug in a Place a mile off and about half as far from the Shore but this Water was not fit to drink However we all concluded that it would serve to boil our Oatmeal for Burgoo whereby we might save the Remains of our other Water for drinking till we should get more and ac∣cordingly the next day we brought aboard Hogsheads of it but while we were at work about the Well we were sadly pest∣er'd with the Flies which were more troublesome to us than the Sun tho' it shone clear and strong upon us all the while  very hot All this while we saw no more of the Natives but saw some of the Smoaks of some of their Fires at or miles distance  The Land hereabouts was much like that part of  New Holland  that I formerly described Vol I p 'tis low but seemingly barricado'd with a long Chain of Sandhills to the Sea that let's nothing be seen of what is farther within Land A  high Water the Tides rising so high as they do the Coast shews very low but when 'tis low Water it seems to be of an indifferent heighth At low WaterMark the Shore is all Rocky so that then there is no Landing with a Boat but at high Water a Boat may come in over those Rocks to the Sandy Bay which runs all along on this Coast The Land by the Sea for about or yards is a dry San∣dy Soil bearing only Shrubs and Bushes of divers sorts Some of these had them at this time of the year yellow Flowers or Blossoms some blue and some white most of them of a very fragrant Smell Some had Fruit like Peasecods in each of which there were just ten small Peas I opened many of them and found no more nor less There are also here some of that sort of Bean which I saw at  RosemaryIsland  and another sort of small red hard Pulse growing in Cods also with  little black Eyes like Beans I know not their Names but have seen them used of∣ten in the  EastIndies  for weighing Gold and they make the same use of them at  Guinea  as I have heard where the Wo∣men also make Bracelets with them to wear about their Arms These grow on Bushes but here are also a Fruit like Beans growing on a creeping sort of Shrub∣like Vine There was great plenty of all these sorts of Codfruit growing on the Sandhills by the Seaside some of them green some ripe and some fallen on the Ground but I could not perceive that any of them had been gathered by the Na∣tives and might not probably be whole∣some Food  The Land farther in that is lower than what borders on the Sea was so much as we saw of it very plain and even part∣ly Savannahs and partly Woodland The Savannahs bear a sort of thin course Grass The Mould is also a courser Sand than that by the Seaside and in some places 'tis Clay Here are a great many Rocks in the large Savannah we were in which are or Foot high and round at top like a Haycock very remarkable some red and some white The Woodland lies farther in still where there were di¦vers sorts of small Trees scarce any thre  Foot in circumserence their Bodies o  Foot high with a Head of small Knibs or Boughs By the sides of the Creeks es∣pecially nigh the Sea there grow a few small black MangroveTrees  There are but few LandAnimals I saw some Lizards and my Men saw two or three Beasts like hungry Wolves lean like so many Skeletons being nothing but Skin and Bones 'Tis probable that it was the Foot of one of those Beasts that I mention'd as seen by us in  N Holland  Vol I p We saw a Rackoon or two and one small speckled Snake  The Landfowls that we saw here were Crows just such as ours in  England  small Hawks and Kites a few of each sort but here are plenty of small TurtleDoves that are plump fat and very good Meat Here are or sorts of smaller Birds some as big as Larks some less but not many of either sort The SeaFowl are Pelicans Boobies Noddies Curlews Seapies  c  and but few of these neither  The Sea is plentifully stock'd with the largest Whales that I ever saw but not to compare with the vast ones of the  Nor∣thern  Seas We saw also a great many Green Turtle but caught none here be∣ing no Place to set a TurtleNet in here being no Channel for them and the Tides running so strong We saw some Sharks  and Paracoots and with Hooks and Lines we caught some Rockfish and Old Wives Of Shellfish here were  sters both of the common kind for Eati  and of the Pearlkind and also W  onchs Muscles Limpits Perriwinkles  c  and I gather'd a few strange Shells chiefly a sort not large and thickset all about with Rays or Spikes growing in Rows  And thus having ranged about a consi∣derable time upon this Coast without finding any good fresh Water or any con∣venient Place to clean the Ship as I had hop'd for And it being moreover the heighth of the dry Season and my Men growing Scorbutick for want of Refresh∣ments so that I had little Incouragement to search further I resolved to leave this Coast and accordingly in the beginning of  September  set Sail towards  Timor  AN ACCOUNT Of several PLANTS Collected in  Brasil New Holland Timor  and  New Guinea  referring to the Figures Engraven on the Cop∣per Plates  TAB Fig  Cottonflower  from  Baya  in  Brasil  The Flower con∣sists of a great many Filaments almost as small as Hairs betwixt and Inches long of a Murreycolour on the top of them stand small ashcolour'd  apices  The pedicule of the Flower is inclos'd at the bottom with five narrow stiff Leaves a∣bout six Inches long There is one of this  enus  in Mr  Ray  's Supplement which a∣grees  exactly with this in every respect only that is twice larger at the least It was sent from  Surinam  by the Name of  Momoo  Tab Fig  Jasminum Brasilianum luteum mali limoniae folio nervoso petalis crassis  Tab Fig  Crista Pavonis Brasiliana Bardanae foliis  The Leaves are very tender and like the top Leaves of  Bardana major  both as to shape and texture In the Figure they are represented too stiff and too much serrated  Tab Fig  Filix Brasiliana Osmundae minori serrato folio  This Fern is of that kind which bears it's SeedVessels in Lines on the edge of the Leaves  Tab Fig  Rapuntium Novae Hol∣landiae flore magno coccineo  The  Perian∣thium  compos'd of five long pointed Parts the Form of the SeedVessel and the smal∣ness of the Seeds together with the irre∣gular shape of the Flower and thinness of the Leaves argue this Plant to be a  Ra∣puntium  Tab Fig  Fucus foliis capillaceis brevissimis vesiculis minimis donatis  This elegant  fucus  is of the  Erica Marina  or  Sargazo  kind but has much finer parts than that It was collected on the Coast of  New Holland  depictions of plants  Tab Plants found in Brasil  depictions of plants  Tab Plants found in New Holland  depictions of plants  Tab Plants found in New Holland  Tab Fig  Ricinoides Novae Hol∣landae anguloso crasso folio  This Plant is shrubby has thick woolly Leaves especi∣ally on the under side Its Fruit is tricoc∣cous hoary on the outside with a  Calix  divided into five parts It comes near  Ricini fructu parvo frucosa Curassavica folio Phylli P B pr  Tab Fig  Solanum spinosum Novae Hollandiae Phylli foliis subrotundis  This new  Solanum  bears a blewish Flower like the others of the same Tribe the Leaves are of a whitish colour thick and woolly on both sides scarce an Inch long and near as broad The Thorns are very sharp and thick set of a deep Orange colour especi∣ally towards the Points  Tab Fig  Scabiosa forte Novae Hollandiae statices foliis subtus argenteis  The Flower stands on a Footstalk four Inches long included in a rough Calix of a yellowish colour The Leaves are not above an Inch long very narrow like  Thrift  green on the upper and hoary on the under side growing in tufts Whe∣ther this Plant be a  Scabious Thrift  or  chrysum  is hard to judge from the im∣perfect Flower of the dry'd Speeimen  Tab Fig  Alcea Novae Hollandiae  augustis utrinque villosis  The Leaves  and under side of the Perianthium of this Plant are all woolly The Petala are  very tender five in number scarce so large as the Calix In the middle stands a a  Columella  thick set with thrummy  apiculae  which argue this Plant to belong to the Malvaceous kind  Tab Fig Of what  genus  this Shrub or Tree is is uncertain agreeing with none yet describ'd as far as can be judg'd by the State it is in It has a very beautiful Flower of a red colour as far as can be guess'd by the dry  Specimen  con∣sisting of ten large  Petala  hoary on both sides especially underneath the middle of the Flower is thick set with  Stamin    which are woolly at the bottom the length of the  Petala  each of them crown'd with its  Apex  The  Calix  is divided into five round pointed parts The Leaves are like those of  Amelanchier Lob  green a top and very woolly underneath not running to a point as is common in others but with an Indenture at the upper end  Tab Fig  Dammara ax Nova Hol∣landia Sanamundae secundae Chysii foliis  This new  genus  was first sent from  Am∣boyna  by Mr  Rumphius  by the Name of  Dammara  of which he transmitted two kinds one with narrow and long stiff Leaves the other with shorter and broad∣er The first of them is mention'd in Mr  Petiver  's  Centuria  p by the Name of  Arbor hortensis Javanorum foliis  depictions of plants  Tab Plants found in New Holland Timor  visce augustioribus aromaticis sloribus spicatis stamineis lutescentibus  Mus Pet As also in Mr  Ray  's Supplement to his History of Plants now in the Press This is of the same  genus  with them agreeing both in Flower and Fruit tho' very much differing in Leaves The Flowers are stamineous and seem to be of an herbaceous colour grow∣ing among the Leaves which are short and almost round very stiff and ribb'd on the under side of a dark green above and a pale colour underneath thick set on by pairs answering one another crossways so that they cover the Stalk The Fruit is as big as a Peppercorn almost round of a whitish colour dry and tough with a Hole on the top containing small Seeds Any one that sees this Plant without its SeedVessels would take it for an  Erica  or  Sanamunda  The Leaves of this Plant are of a very aromatick Tast  Tab Fig  Equisetum Novae Hol∣landiae frutesceus foliis longissimis  'Tis doubtful whether this be an  Equisetum  or not the texture of the Leaves agrees best with that  genus  of any being articulated one within another at each Joint which is only proper to this Tribe The longest of them are about nine Inches  Tab Fig  Colutea Novae Hollandiae sloribus amplis coccineis umbellatim dispositis macula purpurea notatis  There being no Leaves to this Plant 'tis hard to say what  genus  it properly belongs to The Flow∣ers are very like to the  Colutea Barbae Jovis folio flore coccineo Breynii  of the same Scarlet colour with a large deep purple Spot in the  vexillum  but much bigger coming all from the same point after the manner of an Umbel The rudiment of the pod is very woolly and terminates in a Filament near two Inches long  Tab Fig  Conyza Novae Hollandiae angustis Rorismarini foliis  This Plant is very much branch'd and seems to be woody The Flowers stand on very short Pedicules arising from the  sinus  of the Leaves which are exactly like  Rosemary  only less It tasts very bitter now dry  Tab Fig  Mohoh Insulae Timor  This is a very odd Plant agreeing with no describ'd  genus  The Leaf is almost round green on the upper side and whi∣tish underneath with several Fibres run∣ning from the insertion of the Pedicule towards the circumference 'tis umbilicated as  Cotyledon aquatica  and  Faba Aegyptiae  The Flowers are white standing on single Footstalks of the shape of a  Stramoniam  but divided into four points only as is the  Perianthium  Tab Fig  Fucus ex Nova Guines uva marina dictus foliis variis  This beautiful  fucus  is thick set with very small short tufts of Leaves which by the help  depictions of plants  Tab Plants found in y  e  Sea neer New Guinea  of a magnifying Glass seem to be round and articulated as if they were SeedVes∣sels besides these there are other broad Leaves chiefly at the extremity of the Branches serrated on the edges The  vesiculae  are round of the bigness express'd in the Figure  Tab Fig  Fucus ex Nova Guinea Fiuviatilis Pisanae J B foliis  These Plants are so apt to vary in their Leaves according to their different States that 'tis hard to say this is distinct from the last It has in several Places not all express'd in the Figure some of the small short Leaves or SeedVessels mention'd in the former which makes me apt to believe it the same gather'd in a different state be∣sides the broad Leaves of that and this agree as to their Shape and Indentures  An Account of some Fishes that are Figured in  Plate    See Plate Fig  THis is a Fish of the Tunnykind and agrees well enough with the Fi∣gure in Tab of the Appendix to Mr  Willughby  's History of Fishes under the Name of  Gurabuca  it differs something in the Fins
