Theo Cibber  Edwyn  a Gentleman Attendant on  Athelwold  by Mr  Fielding  WOMEN  Elfrid  Daughter to the Duke of  Cornwall  by Mrs  Booth  Ethelinda  Neice to  Oswald  by Mrs  Cibber  Lady Attendant on  Elfrid  by Mrs  Grace  Officers Guards  Men and Women Attendants  The SCENE  Chester  PREFACE to the Reader  IF there is any Thing in my Writings that deserves to be remember'd They will  live  without Patronage If They ought to be forgotten They wou'd  die  in spite of Protection So I commit them to the World unsustain'd by  Dedication  No Patron's Authority can protect a  bad  WorkAnd a  good  one can want no Protection  I am afraid we need look no farther than the  Dedications  of our Poetick Writings for the Source of that  Neglect  which the  Art Itself  complains ofWhile Poetry preserv'd its Honesty it was consider'd with Distinction But when it degenerated into a Traffick between  Praise  and  Reward  it became despis'd like the Gold of  Utopia  not by Ignorance of its Value but through scorn of the Use It was put to  Before I speak of the following Tragedy I am oblig'd to take Notice of another the first Dramatic Sally of my Youth And which I shou'd be asham'd to confess I had the Folly to begin and finish in a Week but that I have Occasion from that Confession to hope Pardon of its Faults and admire the  English Goodnature  which receiv'd it with undeserv'd IndulgenceIt was written on the same Subject with  This  upon Mr  Booth's  recommending it to my Choice It was also acted at the same Theatre and is still a Living Evidence against me under the Name of  Elfrid  or the  Fair Inconstant  As I knew nothing of the Rules of Writing the Play was consequently an unprun'd Wilderness of Fancy with here and there a Flower among the Leaves but without any Fruit of JudgmentI know not how it came to pass that  Athelwold  even in That Piece deserv'd some little Pity But I am afraid I was too Dull a Painter to hit a Likeness for the Ladies  Elfrid  suffer'd more by  my  ill Conduct than Her own and was a lighter  Inconstant  than the Histories of those Times have shown her And as for  Edgar  The Monarch came out of  my  Hands as one of his Successors out of the ArchDuke of  Austria  's stript of Every Thing that became his Condition and only a King in his  Title  I therefore consider'd myself as not deserving Pardon from the Publick till I had purchas'd it with something  Better  on the same SubjectThis was the Original of  Athelwold  The New Play has neither Thought Design nor Expression in the least resembling the Old one And my only Reason for troubling the Reader with this little Story is because shou'd there be any Thing in the second Attempt greatly Preferable to the First it will be a  Proof  that Fancy for to say  Genius  wou'd be making bold with what is none of my own wants the Aid of the Judgment and shou'd have Regard to the  Rules  of an Art which like Religion had an Orthodox Establishment but like that too has been warp'd and weaken'd by mysterious Dullness and the dry Pride of Commentators  I am unable to execute any Thing in Poetry if I have  wasted  the Care I bestow'd on this TragedyNor can I have so unjust an Opinion of the Publick Taste tho I think Nobody will celebrate it for Poetry as not to know that shou'd there be Merit in  Athelwold  there are Spirits in the Nation who have Influence and Generosity to awaken others into their SentimentsI say this for the sake of the  Stage  for as to myself the Distinction of Deserving to be  Read  is all the Advantage I propose from my Writings  A HILL  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr WILKS  OUR Author's Wishes partial to the Stage  Not  for himself your Favour wou'd engage  Not his own Cause but ours he wou'd defend  Nor fears an Enemynor tasks a Friend  But frankly bids me  own  that from  his  Plays  He  means  no Profit and  deserves  no Praise  Yet has he  one  fond Passion to impart  One favourite Weakness that has warm'd his Heart  Constant  he doats on a declining Fair  Yet recommends his Mistress to  your  Care  Tho' past her  Bloom  still  tempting  she appears  A  midag'd  Matronof three thousand Years  Slight not  Dame Tragedy  nor fancy Sirs  That  Pain  and Spleen and Age alone are hers  Old  as you think her still she  moves  and  warms  Smiles thro' the Soul and swells the Heart with Charms  But the vain  Prude  too coy to yield at Pleasure  Vows she'll be  wedded  or withhold her Treasure  Take her to  Wife  the Match cou'd ne'er be wrong  But for one Qualityshe'll  live  too long  Cou'd ye for once forgive the  serious  Strain  And bear a useful Truth undress'd and plain  Fain wou'd the Muse remind you that the  Stage  Receiv'd most Honour from the  wisest Age  Athens  shone brightest when the crowded  Scene  Fir'd her bold Sonsto  dare  to  act  to  mean  Greatly to  copy  the departed  Great  And  be  the Chiefs they learnt to  emulate  Warm'd by this Heat which to their  Plays  they ow'd  The guided Passions of a  People glow'd  High beat their cherish'd Hearts in Glory's Cause  Firm stood their Freedom and long liv'd their Laws  Charm'd  into Virtue and by  Pleasure  taught  The raptur'd Youth the meant Impression caught  Grew up to Greatness Liberty and Arts  And snatch'd the  Heroe  's from the  Player  's Parts  Oh cou'd we live to hail the future Day  When sparkling Folly shall give  Genius  way  When  low light Scenes  shall tempt the Eye in vain  And  Passion  's Power impress the Heart again  Then shall the Muses like their Monarch smile  And  all  Heaven's Blessings crown his happy Isle  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs BOOTH  THIS whining Tragedy has made me hoarse  Yet as an Epilogue's a Thing of course  I can't help telling ye before we part  I'm glad my Husband's dead with all my Heart  That's one Confessionand one more shall be  I wish the Author were as dead as he  His  murdering  Muse in downright Love of teizing  Kills  one  for  being pleas'd  and one for  pleasing  Stabs  Ethy  'cause  her  Love was an untrue one  Drowns  my  good Man because he lik'd a new one  Lud Lud  what Work 'twou'd make among the  Fair  Shou'd every  Belle  be  drown'd  that loves a  Pair  And as for  Beaux  who make no Bones of erring  They'd  fill the Seas all round like Shoals of Herring  A fine Example truly don't it  move  ye  Were it well follow'dhow 'twou'd soon  improve  ye  Send ye in Pairs to Heav'n where good Folks Trust is  Martyrs Lord help ye of  Poetic Justice  I for my Part had a  sweet  Race to run  I  not  to be a Queenmust be a  Nun  No Ladies have a care os thatThe Poet  Belies the Storyand thank Heaven I know it  Elfrid  was  wiser  and the King was  kinder  Even in the Convent  he  knew how to find her  He pious Prince lov'd Penitence so well  That oft he trac'd it to the loneliest Cell  Confess'd  the Saints  Himself  bless'd Occupation  Freely bestow'd his  Princely  Consolation  And  eas'd  the  Father Girards  of the Nation  Nay tis no laughing MatterI am  serious  I meant no Mischief Ino Hint mysterious  Ask  Hollinshead  He'll tell ye if tis new t'ye  That  Edgar  was a Lyonat  Church Duty  One  of His Virtues needs must Envy raise  He was the veriest  Patriot  of His Days  He not to  Maids  alone thought Pity due  His will  unwearied  work'd for  Husbands  too  Dependent Princes sent their Wives by th' Dozen  To  tax  This Bounty of their Royal Cozen  And Eight  dubb'd  Monarchs of his own Creation  Row'd  him in grateful Triumph round the Nation  This being sowhat does our Author Merit  Who wrongs a Princeof such a  Publick Spirit  Hang him dull PoetI'll say nothing for him  In good King  Edgar's  Quarrel I abhor him  Take him among yeand if e're you'd mend him  To some  kind Jesuit  for new Notions send him  ATHELWOLD A TRAGEDY  ACT SCENE  A Rocky Coast without the City of  Chester  Athelwold Elsrid Edwyn  Men and Women Attendants  Athelwold to an Attendant  BACK to the Boat caution the

Walls been pass'd unseen  Elsrid  Why shunn'd you  Edgar  You had struck no Shoal  Had Jealousy not wreck'd you Where was the Danger  Had we amid the shouting Swarms approach'd  His glitt'ring Barge that proud of eight Kings Rowing  Methought mov'd conscious of her glorious Freight  And felt her Sovereign's Triumph  Athelwold  Edgar  is young  Am'rous impatient hot as the Summer Sun  But as the Shadow changing  Emma  the Sister  Of  Leolyn  my Friend must be his Queen  That Day once past that Day now near my  Elsrid  Trembling no longer for my Soul's best Treasure  I shall unveil thee to the Eye of  Edgar  Then in full Lustre break upon the Court  Charm the glad World and swell the Voice of Wonder  Till then  Elsrid  Till then you think a Woman's Honour  Is safest when not trustedCome be wise  Laugh at your Sex's Notions and see Truth  Unprejudic'd by Maxim You have been taught  That a Man's Caution guards a Woman's Vertue  Believe me 'tis an ErrorWrong'd by the Doubt  We make that Doubt our Licence and grow  light  To justify Suspicion  Athelwold  Of thee not jealous  I fear the Heart of  Edgar  There is a Secret  Which yet thou must not knowFor all the Glory  Fortune could heap upon a happy Wisher  I would not he had seen thee  Elsrid  Why chuse you then  To lodge me in the Gardens of his Palace  Athelwold  Safely conceal'd in my Apartment there  While Triumph busies the tumultuous Court  Fair as thou art thou may'st remain unknown  Till soon we reimbark for  Lancaster  But Fate has driven me under  Edgar  's Eye  Nor can I shun his Presence  A Shout at distance  The Barge triumphant  'Twixt the two sounding Banks floats proudly in  See the broad Sprinklings from the golden Oars  Dash'd in gay Mists against the glitt'ring Sun  Scatter a liquid LightningE're the King lands  Retire my Soul's soft Charmer From this Boat  That foremost strikes the Shore descends a Lord  Wily suspicious flatt'ring base and busy  Malice and Fear divide his motley Soul  Soft'ning Submission dwells on his cool Tongue  But his Heart burns with EnvySee he lands  Oswald  the State's Prime MinisterRetire  He must not see theeLook  Edwyn  attends thy Coming  Exit leading Elfrid  Enter Oswald attended  Oswald  AwayawayHere  EldredHubertArnold  Creep you this reptile Pace when a King's Honour  Hangs on your drowsy Motion  You  to the Hall  See the PortReeve prepar'd to line the Streets  With his furr'd Gowns and Scarlet  You  to the Castle  Exit first Messenger  Say to the Governor the King lands short  And means to pass the BridgeHaste  you too  fly  Exit second Messenger  Bid holy  Dunstan  and his whiterob'd Train  Throw wide the brazen Gates of the Cathedral  Exit third Messenger  All this was well provided for before  But 'tis no Fault to seem too diligent  Where Bustling goes for LoyaltyEarl  Athelwold  Reenter Athelwold  Fortune befriend your Hopes my noble Lord  As she does ours Who on a Day like this  When Sovereign  Edgar  triumphs like a God  Brings back his Godlike Fav'rite to partake  A Splendor thought imperfect wanting you  Athelwold  Oh 'tis too kind my Lord amidst your Cares  To waste this fine Court Rhet'rick on a Plainness  So unadorn'd as mineIn War's big Pomp  The King sometimes in the broad Battle's Front  Finds  Athelwold  most near him But for a Day  So safely plum'd as this a thousand Feathers  Loftier and far more gay than mine had been  Were proud no doubt to wave in State about him  Oswald  Nay my good Lord your Enemies must own  Your Valour's ablest Rival is your Reason  Athelwold  Why will you angle with too short a Line  In Depths of cautious HonestyI  know  you  Why will you still you and your envious Faction  Bow to the happy Favourite you hate  And smile your Curses on meShame on your Meanness  If I deserve Esteem give it sincere  If not disdain to court the Man you fear  And with brave Truth renounce me  Oswald  Why thus 'tis ever  Distrustful Men but nourish new Suspicions  From the best Means we use to quench the old  Still I am misconceiv'dMy Lord My Lord  Ill Agents have been busyAnd here comes one  Reenter Edwyn  Whom  Oswald  should avoidI'll charm the King  With News of your Return  Exit Oswald  Edwyn  A newborn Love  Is full of soft ImpatienceSoon as arriv'd  I was commanded to return and press you  To shorten your meant Absence  Athelwold  Is she safe  Edwyn  Egbert  is warn'd shou'd the King quit the Crowd  And but approach the Garden to conceal her  Athelwold  Then I will fear  No longer but expect the King and meet him  With a mask'd Smile of InnocenceO  Edwyn  Should  Ethelinda  know I have married  Elfrid  How wretched would it make her  Oswald  hates thee  As if he read our Secret through thy Heart  Saw there thy gen'rous Silence which conceals  My dearstol'n Night of Joy with that soft Charmer  Who that saw both could think  her  Neice to  Oswald  Edwyn  So my good Lord would her false Servant say  That doubly faithless Fairone who betray'd  To me her Lady's Honour yet forsook me  Athelwold  She wrong'd her Mistress but she lov'd  thee  surely  Who in that Secret gave up both our Honours  To thy safe KeepingBut since all was told thee  'Twere now a fruitless Point of proud Reserve  With thee to keep that Silence which the Favour'd  Shou'd hold in rev'rence of a Lady's Honour  As sacred as his GloryOh suppose not  Because she bless'd my Wishes that  Ethelinda  Yielded like common Beauties  Edwyn  'Twas plain You lov'd her  For when her Horse was drown'd in  Severn  's Ford  You from your own leapt rash Thro' the swol'n stream  Plung'd on and snatch'd her sinking  Athelwold  True I lov'd her  But lov'd her with  Desire  while in  Her  Breast  Love which at first was gen'rous Gratitude  Drew all its Warmth from PityNever never  Shall I forget how blissfully I won her  'Twas the dear Night before this fatal Journey  I found her  Edwyn  sunk on her Couch alone  Weeping with am'rous Grief for coming Absence  Loose and enchantingnegligent her Dress  Faint was her Air and a kind nameless Languor  Sigh'd in short Heavings from her soften'd Heart  And every Breath was Tenderness and Love  There while transported on my trembling Knee  Bending I gaz'd and hung devoutly o'er her  Raptur'd and charm'd I plung'd amidst Attraction  Sigh'd on her Eyes breath'd o'er her panting Bosom  And snatch'd her Soul unguardedMillions of Vows  Fierce burning Vows of Everlasting Love  Transport and Marriage and Eternal Truth  Thaw'd her reluctant Vertue to Belief  Thenin the soft Desire's new Warmth I press'd her  Till in the beating Tumult of her Heart  She gaveshe knew not whatnor meant Compliance  Fortune renounce me  Edwyn  but my Reason  Prefers her even to  Elfrid  My Passion did not  The Love she felt for me I feel for  Elfrid  And am unwillingly undonelike Her  A warlike Symplony  Harkthe King lands Th'avenging Hand of Heaven  Points out my BasenessHow shall my guilty Eye  Meet the wrong'd Goodness of the Royal  Edgar  How shall I skreen the Charms of injur'd  Elfrid  From the King's sightWhat shall my bleeding Heart  Say to lost  Ethelinda  Yet  Edwyn  find her  Tell her I come while every busy Eye  Hangs on the Pomp to sigh my Soul out to her  Say in the Inmost GardenThe Close Walk  That points upon the Grotto  Edwyn  Fatal Wreck  Heaven that commission'd it avert my Fears  Exit Edwyn  Athelwold alone  He comesI'll walk a Turn behind these Rocks  And gather Firmness to sustain his Eye  Whom most of Men I love yet most have wrong'd  Exit  SCENE II  Enter Edgar  from the Triumph atttended by  Leolyn Oswald  c  Edgar  Chester  This Act to Time's last Hour renowns  Thy Name with  Edgar  's Far as the bounded World  Gives Space for Fame to breathe in shall be spread  The Boast of this Day's TriumphYet Thou say'st  Nations whose Names lie deep in unborn Time  Will rise and censure and mistake our Purpose  Leolyn  Many will judge amiss and call it Insult  Edgar  I  know  it and despise it My freed Soul  Then stript of her Encumb'rance mounting strong  Shall rise above Ambition nor hold Fame  By the faint Tenure of weak mortal Praise  But from the Partners of her bright Enlargement  Spirits that judge unprejudic'd and move  Unbounded and in Millions fill those Voids  Which Thought ev'n akes to guess at  Leolyn  The Forms of Homage  Differ with Sovereign's Wills yet are but Forms  Kings suffer not by Seemings if they did  The Shame that follows Insult wou'd cut double  And wound the Wounder deepest  Edgar  Nobly spoke  Spoke like the Friend of  Edgar  and of  Athelwold  Oswald  Malignant Envy will not dare misjudge  The Virtues of our Monarch Rais'd to this Height  Our Wishes are outstript and all our Task  Is to receive and wonder at our Blessings  Edgar  No Flattery  Oswald  Tis my noblest Pride  To have  deserv'd  Applause To  listen  to it  Sullies the conscious Glory  Athelwold  Reenter Athelwold  Friend of my Soul my Life's best self my Light  My every Wish at once and every Blessing  Athelwold kneeling  My Gracious partial Sovereign  Edgar  Risenor distress me  With this vain Ceremony Bow but to Heaven  That made thee  not  a King to make thee  more  And stampt thy Soul divinely  Cornwall  's Daughter  I find deserv'd not I so long shou'd lose thee  All thy long Letters welcome as they were  Brought me no Hope from  Elsrid  Fame it seems  Deceiv'd us and had flatter'd her  Athelwold  She's Fair  But never cou'd have been that striking Charmer  So found and lost at once  She  flames not out  With That strong Blaze of Charms that living Fire  That burns unquench'd upon your Royal Memory  Edgar  No  Athelwold  I see I hear she cannot  Else had thy Eyes catch'd Fire and stream'd it  on  me  Else had thy labouring Heart oppress'd with Meaning  Shook like an Earthquake in Discharge of Passion  Thou art a  cold  DescriberOhthe Day  The dear remember'd Day when at the Altar  Where in Thanksgiving I had bow'd to Heav'n  Heav'n seem'd descending on meMy rais'd Eye  Met her flash'd Charms amidst a gazing Crowd  Who from the Scaffolded Cathedral's Sides  Pour'd their bold Looks upon me Greatness and Languor  Flow'd in a soften'd Radiance from her Mien  And kindled every Shrine with new Divinity  Sweetness sat smiling on her humid Eyeballs  And lightwing'd Fancy danc'd and flam'd about her  Scarce were the solemn Duties of the Place  Remember'd while I saw herAt lastwith Pain  Slowdragging my reluctant Eyes away  I lost here're Religion licens'd Love  To steal a second Wonder  Oswald  Strange that since then  Inquiry shou'd have toil'd in vain to find her  Edgar  One wou'd have thought the Light that paints the World  Might have been lost as possibly as hers  But since all Search is vain and farfam'd  Elsrid  Fails my last Hope I will redeem my Heart  And quench the blazing ImageDanger and Arms  Shall fright the trembling Softness from my Soul  I will resume War's Thunder  Athelwold  Leolyn  Help me to conquer Wake me again to Glory  Tear me from Loveand guide me to Renown  Trumpets without  HarkThey move onStayFriends have much to speak of  Anon we meet again  Exit Edgar follow'd by Oswald  c  Athelwold  Prince  Leolyn  You had a warlike tho' unhappy Father  Yon rugged Hills have eccho'd with his Glory  But that his last too fatal Rashness forfeited  Half  Wales  your Patrimony  Edgar  blushing  Must have remember'd when He spoke of Love  You have a Sister's claim  Leolyn  Emma  my Lord  Was then a Sovereign's Daughter now she is sunk  To Sister of a Subject Time was when  Edgar  Short of his present Fortune weigh'd my Daring  And vow'd my Sister shou'd partake his Throne  He sees me now grown tame an humble suff'rer  And while he holds my Lands neglects my Blood  And boasts another Love to shame my Patience  Athelwold  Hope better from him The King's Heart is Noble  And his past Promise sacred Passion's Tide  Bears him aslant and must a while have Way  Unite your means with mine my Fate requires  Your Sister shou'd be Queen Urge Rights of Faith  And leave th'Event to me  Leolyn  I can urge nothing  Let me consess that Love the smiling Ruin  Love has unman'd me till my soften'd Heart  Wants ev'n the Will to murmur  Ethelinda  The gentle  Ethelinda  fills my Soul  Why start you at her Name why have you shunn'd  To urge her Pity in your Friend's Behalf  You sav'd

Athelwold  Be wise and think no more of  Ethelinda  Leolyn  Bid me not live and I'll obey you gladly  But when you bid me cease to think of  Her  You bid me live to Sense of all Death's Pains  And die

true and no where Greater  Than in the Breast of  Leolyn  Yet sure  A Prohibition of such fatal Weight  Owes your Friend's Ear some Reason  Athelwold  I have no Reason  Ruin and Fate break in upon my Schemes  And plunge me in Confusion  Leolyn  Ruin and Fate  Schemes and ConfusionThis Disorder proves  What I've long fear'd that where I hop'd a Friend  I fir'd a Rival's Jealousy  Athelwold  You

Innocent alone  act  steadily  The Guilty can but  mean  itO  Ethelinda  In the dark Race of Vice when once begun  We start on Mischiefs we most wish to shun  Push'd by the Fate of Guilt and thence accurs'd  New Crimes grow needful to support the first  Till from Dishonour we to Ruin fall  And one disjointed Virtue loosens all  Exit  The End of the First ACT  ACT II SCENE I  A Grove in the Palace Garden  Athelwold Ethelinda  Ethelinda  ALL this is false in Reason but your Eloquence  Proud of its Power provokes you to offend  That you may force ForgivenessWas it not cold  Too cold for Love in all this cruel Length  Of chearless Absence when your dang'rous Charge too  Was but to gaze on Beauty never to write  Never to bid me hope the muchfear'd  Elfrid  Had left your Heart still partial to my Fondness  A Fondness that destroy'd me Turn your Eyes from me  They look as they'd reproach me Do not see me  But tell me why you made such speed to leave me  Had you but staid to add one Hour of Peace  To those of guilty Softness Had I been yours  Your Wife that fatal Morning you do not know  What Tears it wou'd have sav'd me  Athelwold  Oh speak no more  Your Words are wing'd with Fire they pierce my Soul  They enter and burn in meOst have I trembled  As I do now when Rev'rence and Desire  Shot from those Angel Eyes have warr'd within me  Yet never was I thus distress'd before  Ethelinda  That you are gen'rous my fond Heart confesses  Else how destroy'd a Wretch were  Ethelinda  If like the Base among your Sex you shunn'd me  Nor pitied the kind Weakness that betray'd me  But added Shame to Guilt and grew inconstant  And left me for another Save me ye Saints  To what a dreadful Depth of startling Misery  Had my lost Honour plung'd me  Athelwold  Grac'd as you are  With artless Vertue and unconscious Beauty  Strengthen'd with Wisdom sanctified by Truth  And sainted o'er with SweetnessTho' your Voice  Is tun'd to Transport and each melting Accent  Shakes to my Soul and swells Despair to Musick  Yet is there something so disorder'd here  That I ev'n wish thee silentThy soft Words  Moving and warm and gentle as thy Bosom  Strike me like Death when his eternal Frost  Creeps in cold Anguish o'er us  Ethelinda  Oh my kind Lord  To feel this wondrous Extasy for me  This noblest tend'rest Mark of mournful Passion  Is such a sweet Atonement sor my Tears  That I could weep for everBe it my Glory  My Duty's Pride and my full Heart's chief Joy  To give unbounded Love in soft Exchange  For your indulg'd EndcarmentLet me not live  If I prefer not that dear Name your Wife  To all those empty Sounds those titled Nothings  Which  Edgar  treasures for his unknown Queen  My Lordyou startand tremble and look pale  Comethis quick Sense of Gratitude and Love  Works too intense and I must chide you for it  Athelwold  It is too muchAnd Honour and Humanity  Disclaim the brutal Heart that cou'd bear this  And be less mov'd than I amCurse on the wild  The boundless Luxury of wanton Love  What have I lost What am I doom'd to suffer  Who cou'd heap Suff'rings here  Ethelinda  Suff'rings my Lord  And wanton LoveWhat LoveWhose Sufferings  Athelwold  Mine mine thou injur'd Truthwho cou'd name wanton  And mix a Thought of thee  Ethelinda  But you nam'd Suff'rings  Athelwold  What Lover lives without 'em  Ethelinda  A Lover's Sufferings  Once past give present Joys a livelier Relish  The sacred Tie that firms a Wife's fost Claim  Will free pain'd Mem'ry from the Blush of Weakness  Athelwold aside  How mean is Guilt that it must bow the Heart  To Falshood and DisguiseNew in Dissembling  I shall betray my Grief and shame my Art  The Suff'ring that I meant my  Ethelinda  Was that an illtim'd Chance a while withholds  Our Hands But what are nuptial Forms to Love  Prince  Leolyn  my Friendalas he loves you  Loves you my Soul's sweet Pain to such Excess  That his Life hangs but on his Hope of you  Jealous he dies with Fear that I am now  His Rival in your Lovewhat will he feel  When I am own'd your ChoiceMay not your Pity  Indulge Appearance for my Friend's wish'd Ease  Till Time or Accident gives means to save him  Mean while  Ethelinda  What wou'd you do mean while my Lord  You wou'd not sure that I receive him hear him  Athelwold  That were too much It might perhaps suffice  Shou'd I more rarely and with Caution seek  The Blessing of your Presence  Ethelinda  My Lord my Lord  You are detectedMy taught Heart at length  Blind as Love made it sees your Baseness through  And burns with Shame and bursts with Indignation  This poor Deceit was form'd but to evade  My due Repair of Honour 'Twas the word Wife  That made this sudden Politician of you  Athelwold  Soften those angry Eyes which sparkle on me  Ethelinda  Awaynor bring Contagion to my Soul  Oh what a dreadful Change in my poor Heart  Has one weak Moment madescorn'd like the Vile  Dishonour'd infamous despis'd for ever  I must become a Wanderer round the World  Meet Coldand HungerPoverty and Shame  Anguish and InsultBetter all than Man  The faithless Murd'rer ManWhat am I doom'd to  Whom have I trusted Oh revenging Heav'n  See my Distress and punish me with more  I cannot be too wretchedBegone Deceiver  I wou'd not curse theeI will not wish thee Pain  But never never let me see thee more  Athelwold  Be not transported thus  Ethelinda  Insolent Coldness  But I deserve it allMy Fairy Dream  Must last no longer and I wake to Woe  The pleasing Folly sinks and in its Room  Rise Penitence and Scorn and lasting Pain  Now now the shifting Scene makes haste to change  Now now comes on the Race of Shame and Grief  Which every Woman is condemn'd to run  Who trusts her Honour to betraying Man  Yet every Woman where she loves believes  Tho' not to doubt is thus to be undone  Oh what a Diff'rence 'twixt the Calms of Vertue  And these heartrending Pangs of Guilt and Shame  Far has your fatal Journey outgone all  That my slow Fears forbodedThese are the Joys  The Sweets the Transports the Eternal Rounds  Of Love and Tenderness and Gratitude  Which were to charm away my sense of Ruin  O Woman WomanWhat is Vanity  What is Belief that tho' a Thousand fall  We  shall Conquer and still hold our Conquests  Athelwold  By the sweet Mem'ry of that dearest Night  Ethelinda  Curse on th' illchosen OathAll you can swear  By That will be as false and base as you are  Loosen your hated HoldI will not hear you  Athelwold  Cou'd you say  hated  Ethelinda  OffBy the Eye of Heaven  That saw my Faith betray'd not all thy Arts  Shall sooth me to forgive theeAwayBe gone  Athelwold  Look yonder  By all my Hopes of Peace your Uncle  Oswald  And  Leolyn  in Conf'renceOh thinkRecover  Your scatter'd Spirits and round the neighb'ring Grot  Let us take diff'rent Walks and shun their Eye  Ethelinda  When next I see thee may my Woes  Athelwold  Oh hold  That Oath wou'd kill meWhy do you tremble thus  Shall we not meet again  Ethelinda  Onceand no more  Till in Eternity  Athelwold  An Hour hence here  Exeunt severally  SCENE II  Enter  Oswald  and  Leolyn  Oswald  What and was this your doughty Cause of Quarrel  Because he boasts to have won from  Ethelinda  That Woman's Toy you sigh for  Leolyn  I wish indeed  But cannot wish dishonourably  Oswald  That is  You wou'd not tell as he doeswhy that's generous  Honour in Love is silenceBut two such Friends  As you and  Athelwold  cannot methinks  Have fought an am'rous QuarrelYour Rival's Thoughts  Are fill'd with high State Projects something like Jealousy  Of Trust suppos'd betray'dsome Plot some Schemings  Some Aim your Caution started at or which  Your Oath to  Edgar  check'd your wish'd Assent to  Something like this no doubt provok'd proud  Athelwold  No matterFear him not  Oswald  has Power  And can procure you the King's Thanks perhaps  Ev'n against favour'd  Athelwold  As for his Tale  Of  Ethelinda  Women are passive Agents  And when Love prompts them can outsuffer Martyrs  I wou'd not swear he wrongs her yet I think so  Believe him not till I have sounded her  Half  Wales  with  Leolyn  a Prince restor'd  Shou'd please a Woman better than Earl  Athelwold  A Traitor fall'n from PowerWas it not thus  Speak frankly to your Mistress's Disposer  And let Her thank your Loyalty  Leolyn  Lord  Oswald  I am unpractis'd in the Arts of Court  And my free Thoughts range open as my Eyeballs  Wrong'd as I am by  Athelwold  my Heart  Disdains to hide his VirtuesHe may have wishes  He may deceive in Love but not in Loyalty  A brave Man cannot serve a Prince and wrong him  Oswald  Nobly remark'dIn Faith your Honour charms me  We live in dang'rous Times and Men must learn  To try the Bosoms they wou'd trust their Peace in  What sudden Ruin might not careless Innocence  Draw on a great Man's FortuneHad I unwarily  Espous'd your Int'rest e're my Art had pois'd  Your hop'd Fidelity I had not known you  Now all that  Ethelinda  holds is yours  But what's already  Athelwold  's  Leolyn  By Heav'n  I cannot bear th' insinuated Guilt  The shadowy doubt distracts my tingling Heart  And I cou'd kill thee but for trifling on it  Oswald  Kind temp'rate MadmanTake my Thanks so due  To your indulg'd ForbearanceBy good Saint  Austin  These Lovers are the wildest of all Lunaticks  Their Ravings have no IntervalsBut see  Your smiling Stars have sent your Mistress hither  That Madness may be match'd and sooth'd with Folly  Leolyn  Oh my full HeartTis she  Oswald  Thou finish'd Lover  ComeHear me charge her for theeSo  Ethelinda  Enter Ethelinda  Alone and Cheeks thus rosyOne wou'd have sworn  The Sun as lively as He looks to day  Had wanted warmth without a Lover's Aid  To light up that Carnation  Ethelinda  I meant my Lord  To have left the GardenBut mistook the Walk  I know not howI found the Inner Door  Fast lock'dSo came about this shadier Way  Oswald  You seem confus'd methinks  Ethelinda  But  warm my Lord  Oswald  'Tis a good Omen to a Lover's Hopes  That you bring Warmth about youPrince  Leolyn  Has sigh'd a thousand Raptures in your Praise  And that he loves you truly take this Mark  Elsewhere he's EloquentDumb in  your  Company  And never look'd so like the Thing he is not  As you now see him  Leolyn  Oh judge not of my Pain  By this too light DescriptionDid not soft Termblings  Seize on my Tongue I cou'd have told my Passion  In words that humbler Truths have taught to speak it  Ethelinda  'Tis yours my Lord by Priviledge of Blood  To treat me without CeremonyButSir  If you wou'd have me think you really love  Swear but to grant the first Request I make  And I shall wish you happy  Leolyn  I swear with Transport  Ethelinda  This moment leave me then nor ever more  Speak of your hopeless Passion  Exit Leolyn bowing  Oswald  I did not think that thou had'st half this Brav'ry  Nor knew thee for a Heroinewhy what a Pity  This welltim'd Fierceness this high Flash of Spirit  Met not the same deserv'd success as now  When try'd against Earl  Athelwold  Ethelinda  Against Earl  Athelwold  Oswald  Against him for him on him or about him  I am not nice in Women's Rhetorick  If I must speak it plainer it had been well  You had defended your lost Honour there  As here your peevish PrideCome comeI know you  These Secrets keep not long in our Court Air  Already 'tis the Whisper of the DrawingRoom  And by Tomorrow the King's Grooms will have it  Ethelinda  What have I liv'd to hearIs it my Lord  A wonder that I trembleWho what bold Villain  Has gather'd Malice from the Forge of Hell  To charge this Flashood on me  Oswald  Why thou woud'st call him  No Doubt  Sweet Athelwold  Ay stareno matter  When next you meet my Honour against yours  Great odds as Things go now He'll be forgiven  Ethelinda  Did  Athelwold  the soft the gen'rous  Athelwold  Say This of  Ethelinda  Oswald  Say itHe sings it  Boasts it proclaims itNay within this Hour  Hung it on his Sword's Point and held it out  To clear the lovedim'd Eyes of  Leolyn  Ethelinda  Ohillknown  Athelwold  Where shall afflicted Ruin rest conceal'd  If in a Breast like thine it finds no shelter  Only forbear to curse meI do not kneel  In Hope of fruitless PardonInfamy  And Scorn and Want and Shame are light Revenge  To what I feel within meConscious Remorse  And Rage at my own Weakness plunge Despair  And Agony and Madness thro' my Breast  And I thou'd be a Slave if I cou'd wish  To live and let the Sun's broad Eye look on me  Oswald  Rise  Ethelinda  and hide thee in thy Chamber  There as thou can'st be comfortedAnon  I will consider with thee what is due  To Pity what to HonourIn yon cross Walk  Of meeting Sycamores or my Eyes cheat me  Or I diseem the KingTis heBegone  Exit Ethelinda  What brings him hither at a Time like this  His st  more hasty too and his rais'd Look  More ardent and intent than I have seen it  Enter Edgar  Edgar  Oswald  where is shepass'd she not this Way  Oswald  Who Gracious Sovereign  Edgar  Shethe only She  Star of my Hope The Phantom of Desire  The Power that thro' my Eyes rush'd on my Soul  And reigns unnam'd within meMounted but now  I led the shouting Thousands slowly on  Rounding the Hill beneath the terrass'd Garden  There from above her Angel Form look'd over  And beam'd Amazement on meAs once in Arms  Thou did'st behold me like the Lightning's Flash  Shoot from my Saddle to the Aid of  Athelwold  Dismounted and in Danger such was the Fire  With which I leapt from my widestarting Horse  That sidelong fled my Shadow Low on the Ground  I knelt and gaz'd up at herThe sudden Stop  Spread an Alarm thro'out and the check'd Triumph  Halted in short ConfusionThis when she saw  Surpriz'd she darted inward from my Sight  And left Despair behind her  Oswald  Was it now  My Evergracious Lord  Edgar  This Instant now  Blest by unusual Chance a private Key  Gave me swift Entrance thro' the Postern Door  To seek her in the GardenAm I awake  Enter Elfrid  Look  Oswald  lookAgain the shining Vision  Breaks on my glowing EyesThou Pride of Daylight  Thou fairest loveliest noblest Work of Nature  If thou art mortal as my beating Heart  And my fierce Wishes promise how have I lost thee  Where is the Happy Corner of the World  That cou'd thus long conceal thee  Elfrid aside  Again the King  Such was the conqu'ring the commanding Softness  With which he knelt at the remember'd Altar  Whence my long Woes took DateSiris it generous  With this light Freedom of licentious Raillery  To shock a Stranger's Modesty  Oswald  Madam  Edgar  Be dumb  Exit Oswald  Why have those piercing Eyes so ill distinguish'd  The Rev'rence of my ArdourLicence and Freedom  Wou'd in your Presence be dissolv'd to Awe  And flow in Sighs to soften youThis Hand  Oh give it meand I will swear upon it  That my charm'd Spirits never rose till now  In such a Tide of ExtacyThat Heaven  Has left your Sex in shade to light up you  With every Grace that swells Desire in Mortals  Or gives your Guardian Angel Pride to view you  Elfrid  What am I doing Whither am I drawn  Oh the too charming the persuasive Speaker  I feel his powerful Voice in every Vein  As if my Heart expected and confess'd him  Sirif a Woman flatter'd thus agreeably  Can judge unprejudic'd you seem of Birth  Of Honour and of high Accomplishment  I cannot therefore doubt that when I tell you  Earl  Athelwold  protects me you will forbear  To press upon the Solitude I seek  And for his sake regard me  Edgar  If  Athelwold  Protects you I am  Athelwold  's Protector  And you are doubly safe  Elfrid  Perhaps my Sovereign  Forgive an Ign'rance that cou'd see and hear you  Yet waited to be told you were a King  Heaven has diffus'd around your speaking Air  A Glow of Majesty that marks you Royal  I shou'd have knelt before and paid this Duty  Undoubting that I ow'd it  Edgar  Risedear Divinity  And charm me with the sweet the heav'nly Name  You must be worshipp'd byYou said that  Athelwold  Was your Protector Are you of his Blood  Nothing but that can make him dearer to me  Elfrid  Ask me not what I must of Force conceal  And shou'd have more conceal'd but my Surprize  Drew it unpurpos'd from me There is a Reason  A pow'rful Reason why I must insist  You suffer me to leave you my Stay wou'd ruin me  If you have ever felt an am'rous Tenderness  And have not feign'd it now you will not wish  To make a Woman wretchedI dare no more  Than thisYou cannot love if you detain me  Edgar  Riddles and Torturemy charm'd Soul is fill'd  With unspoke Meanings for an Age to come  And you are measuring Moments  Elfrid  Are you a King  Is it your Right to  rule  Command your Passion  There is a Liberty that dwells with Love  Too brave for forc'd SubmissionStir not to follow me  For if you do by all that's holy here  And dreadful in Eternity I swear  I will be lost for ever  Exit Elfrid  Edgar  The conscious Grandeur of her inborn Pride  Inflames her for a Queen Aw'd by her Frown  I stood insensible and unresolv'd  Nor knew that I obey'd herHow blind is Love  Who wou'd have hop'd this Soft'ner of my Soul  While  Athelwold  was wand'ring in her search  Was of the Blood and in the House of  Athelwold  In vain proud Man with busy Blindness strives  And thro' long Mazes each dark Purpose drives  Lost on the Depth of Heaven's unsounded Will  We still float doubtful yet are active still  Unwearied with Mistakes err on content  And deviate into Blessings never meant  End of the Second ACT  ACT III SCENE continues  Oswald and Leolyn  Leolyn  PAtienceCurse Patience why dost thou talk of Patience  With the same Breath the same cold tasteless Calmness  That spoke Distraction to me Hast thou not told me  That she confesses it that this proud Beauty  This haughty fierce disdainful marbly Vertue  That scorn'd  my  honest Passion this austere Frowner  Has beenPerdition on the Name 'Twou'd choak me  Hast thou not fir'd me with the basest Truth  That ever stung the Heart of a Fool Lover  And dost thou talk of PatienceGive it to Statesmen  I spurn the servile Lesson Patience said'st thou  Rage and Despair have broke upon my Soul  And wash'd away all Patience  Oswald  My Spirit  Thank Heaven is none of these wild fiery Racers  That like a Spark in Flax if not strait smother'd  Burns up the Road it runs thro' yet I feel Warmth  When chaf'd by Provocation And let me tell you  There may be ways and we may find 'em Prince  To reach this proud Presumer  Leolyn  I must not aid thee  He was my Friend and then my Life was his  By Tie of DutyHe was since my Enemy  And then again 'twas his by Claim of Conquest  I've lost Revenge to HonourI have no Right  To lift my Arm against him For from a Hand  Oblig'd as mine has been Justice itself  Would redden into MurderBut were I  Oswald  Wrong'd as thou art and free to weigh those Wrongs  Without this Counterpoise of Obligation  I would hunt  Athelwold  to the World's Verge  Nay would leap after him and snatch at Vengeance  Through the unfathom'd Depth of dark Eternity  Oswald  I too perhaps  Who have as light a Spring as you Prince  Leolyn  Might try that dreadful Leap could I be sure  That it was bounded  but  by Depth and Darkness  But shou'd there lie some Realm of Light beyond  I should look foolishly when I fell through  To find my State grown worse than 'twas before  And no Road back againMethinks 'tis strange  That you hot Fighters Friends of barefac'd Anger  Have never learnt our safer courtly Art  Of Vengeance without DangerYou injure me  And I assault you openlyMan against Man  Gives Chance an equal Cast 'Tis you or me  Suppose as first you wrong'd you now shou'd kill me  Where's Vengeance thenWhat Equity is here  Nolet me pay th' Affront with a first Blow  Whereby I hazard nothing That sets us equal  And if I not strike home he's then at liberty  To stand on even Terms and try once more  Leolyn  What dar'st thou do for  Ethelinda  's Honour  Oswald  Force himto please her on and marry her  Leolyn  He cannot marry her  Oswald  Why truly he who has unmarried won  What others marry for will wed at leisure  Leolyn  CannotI sayDeath thou art such a Trifler  Oswald  If you had said he  wou'd not  marry her  Your Doubt had err'd with LikelihoodBut that a Man  Has taught a Maid what Wives alone should learn  And  cannot  therefore make that Maid his Wife  Is a new Point in LogickTroth I have seen  The Court thick sown with these instructed Virgins  Who all grew up to Husbands and sometimes  Have ev'n learnt on for Life from their first Teachers  Leolyn  Tire me no more with this provoking Lightness  Upon a Theme that stings meI tell thee he cannot  Mark mehe  cannot  marry  Ethelinda  Becausehe has already married  Elfrid  Oswald  Elfrid  what  Elfrid  Leolyn  Why that farnois'd  Elfrid  What is her Father's Name The Western Duke  DeathI remember nothing  Cornwall  He  The Duke of  Cornwall  She whose fancied Charms  The King was wise enough to chuse this  Athelwold  His Ear's Engrosser and his Eye's Pourveyor  To go and look at for himA strange mad Humour  Work'd in his Brain that she might prove his Idol  His wild Church Shadow that you have heard him talk of  You know it as well as IWhat do you gaze at  You listen as if I prophesied  Oswald  'Tis Prophecy  And happily foretels the longwish'd Downfal  Of our State ColumnThis  Atlas Athelwold  Who bears the Heaven of Favour on his Shoulders  And shadows all beneath himBut are you sure  Leolyn  I told it not to aid thy dark Designings  But to lament the ruin'd  Ethelinda  What will Fate do with that unhappy Charmer  Honour forbids me now to wish her mine  And he who has undone her is another's  Enter  Edgar  hastily  Edgar  Who is another's  Oswald  The Prince provok'd to Warmth  By News scarce credible and lost in Wonder  We heard not Royal Sir your near Approach  Edgar  What News What WonderWarmThe Prince was warm  YesThe hot  British  Blood your Country's Proverb  The Lightning of your Tempers flames I find  To its full ViolenceWhat mad Presumption  Licens'd your Arroganee so near my Presence  To quarrel with Earl  Athelwold  to Day  Whose Friendship is your Fortune  Leolyn  Sira Prince  Tho' Fortune wrongs him in Restraint of Power  Thinks like a Prince as when his Throne sustain'd him  Edgar  His Throne Proud  Leolyn  Thy Father was a RebelDetected Treason  Inverts the vanquish'd Traitor's Property  And he and his lost Blood are Forfeits all  I love the fearless Bravery of free Spirits  But thy blind Fierceness shocks meUrge it no farther  A moving Pity pleads thy Cause within me  Nor wish I thou shouldst blast it  Oswald  Gracious Sovereign  The Prince unlike his Father fought your Cause  And startles me with News which when I tell you  It joins the Names of  Athelwold  and Traitor  Will justify the Wonder it has given me  Edgar  Traitorand  Athelwold  Profane Conjunction  As well might the two Poles be press'd to join  And crush the unbelieving World between them  Take heed rash Men when ye dare touch the Honour  Of envied  Athelwold  that ye not fail  To prove his Guilt till like a Sunbeam's Glare  It dazzles my Faith's Eye and makes it weep  Or your vile Malice shall but fan the Fire  That kindles to consume yeWhat has he done  LeolynOswald  SpeakOne of ye speak  Or must I wait till you invent some Wile  To skreen your trembling EnvyWhat wou'd ye say  Of  Atheldwold  Oswald  Prince  Leolyn  asserts  That he has married the fam'd Western Beauty  And has describ'd her falsly  Edgar after a Pause  Malicious Ignorance  Oh that the Power that rules the Heart of Man  Wou'd ever thus make Mischief impotent  See now this Falshood Learn to know this Traitor  This  Athelwold  whom your inferior Souls  Want Sympathy to judge ofHis Heart's Refinement  His Elegance of Will adorning Duty  Has plotted with a Subject's sweet Deceit  To cheat his King to ExtasyBy Heaven  I had not known but for your bold mistaking  That he had form'd this dear Design against me  To Night he means when Triumph's weary Noise  Is hush'd in Darkness and my Mind unbent  Has room for mighty Pleasure to surprize me  To pour upon my unexpecting Soul  A Tide of Gladness He but held it back  To make its Flow more welcomeBut I have seen her  Thou too hast seen her  Oswald  The big Joy  Bears down all Mem'ry that you both presum'd  To wrong the Man I love and I forgive it  That you may learn to  worship Athelwold  Oswald  Nay I have ever said even to his Enemies  That he was form'd for Loyalty  Leolyn  This doubling Statesman's Baseness and the Joy  Of his imperious Master have uprooted  The Prudence of my PatienceI must speak  Tho' every Glance of his disdainful Eye  Shot a new Ruin at meSirby this Transport  Of a bless'd Lover near his promis'd Joy  Judge of the Vastness of my Sister's Grief  Whom lone Despair and Sense of hopeless Love  Abandon to Distraction  Edgar  Is it well done  To chuse this Time this Place and this rash Manner  To goad a conscious Frailty  Leolyn  Tomorrow Sir  Had been too late For when your Heart is fill'd  With  Elfrid  and with Rapture how should I hope  There can be room for Thoughts of a past Promise  Or absent  Emma  's Claim  Edgar  Now by the Stings  Which thy abrupt unartful Insolence  Has rouz'd to fix their Points on my touch'd Heart  The Power of Millions warring on my Realms  Shou'd never force me to thy Sister's Arms  Had she a Charm for every Fault of thine  Nature has curs'd her with one single Stain  That blots out all her Vertues The Part she shares  Of thy rebellious Blood is Bane to Love  O  Athelwold  how am I blest in thee  The Guilt of others held against thy Worth  Reflects it stronger on meWell may Traitors  Malign thy Loyalty Antipathies  Hate by the Law of NatureTake his Sword  Why have I Power if not to curb Presumption  When it insults my Pity  See him a Prisoner in the CastleTower  And when I am no longer angryask me  What I resolve concerning him  Exit Edgar  Leolyn  'Tis well  The World and I grown weary of each other  Can separate without Sorrow  Oswald  See if good Fortune  Brings not Earl  Athelwold  into the Garden  Dissemble your Concern and I will move him  To stir in your Behalf and reconcile you  To the King's Pardon  Leolyn  Shame on thy supple Soul  Thou art the moving Shadow on the Dial  Point'st at each diff'rent Hour with equal Ease  But measuring all art nothing  Oswald  By good Saint  Austin  An apt and keen ConceitThe CastleTower  And Solitude will ripen Meditation  Till your Wit quickens and your Fire flames double  Enter  Athelwold  starting at Sight of  Leolyn  Athelwold  Prince  Leolyn  of all th'unwelcome World  The last I wou'd have met  Retiring  Leolyn  Hold Sira Word  Oswald  He has bcthought him of my good Advice  And takes the Hint he scoff'd at  Leolyn  When my Friend serves me I forget him not  Let me discharge a Debt my full Heart owes you  It may be long e're we shall meet again  Therefore before we part I judge it needful  To whisper in your Earthat  Athelwold  Is a  detested Villain  Athelwold drawing  A  Villain Leolyn    After a Pause  Yetkeep thy LifeThou hast been  injur'd  by me  The wrongs that I have  done  forbid Revenge  Against the Wrongs I  suffer  Puts up his Sword  Leolyn  Racks on thy Heart  Forbid Revenge how dar'st  thou  name Revenge  Thou loose Betrayer Thou Reproach of Greatness  Thou dignified Deceiver RevengeGreat Heaven  Let  Ethelinda  's ruin'd Innocence  Riseon thy trembling Soul'twill fright Revenge  And shake thee into Sense of silent Shame  Thou calm cold Ruiner  Athelwold  Nay now thou know'st thou wrong'st me  I have been  too Resolv'd  and dar'd a  Guilt  I will  not  dare to  justify  Farewel  When in some cooler Moment thou deserv'st  To hear my serious Thoughts I may confess  I have been faithless to thee  Leolyn  Staye're thou goest  Let my exulting Heart proclaim one Joy  Edgar  betray'd like me has Power and Will  To punish his BetrayerI have told it  Oswald  already knowsthe King too knows it  And the whole World shall join to curse thee for it  That thou hast married  Elfrid  That  happy Secret  Was all that Fortune lest me for my Vengeance  And I have given it to the Tongues of Millions  Athelwold  Thou hast not done that Outrage on thy Honour  Leolyn  Not done itBy the Pangs which wrung my Soul  For  Ethelinda  's Ruin but I have  Not done it'Twas the last the liveliest Stroke  That I cou'd pierce thy Heart with  Athelwold drawing again  Then thou  shalt  die  My  Guilt absolv'd by baser of thy  own  Disclaims Contritionreassumes Revenge  And gives thee up to my remorseless Anger  Defend thy Life more bravely than before  Or thy hot Blood shall blush upon my Point  To expiate thy Dishoncsty  Leolyn  See where  my  Sword  Lodg'd in a colder Hand secures thy Bravings  Now boast the welltim'd Triumphs of thy Tongue  That safely dares a Prisoner  Athelwold  Restore it  Oswald  How or by whose Command 'tis thine no matter  I have not Leisure now to ask or hear it  Give him his Sword this Instant  Oswald  My Lord I hold it by the King's Command  Athelwold forcing the Sword from Oswald  Talk not to me of KingsLess than a  God  Wou'd now want Power to keep itgive me the Sword  On Pain of thy own Life refuse it not  Awaynor interrupt us  Oswald  Alas Alas  How fruitless is good Counsel  Runs out hastily  Athelwold  Here take thy Sword  And teach it if it can to guard thy Baseness  Leolyn  Oh that my boiling Blood had no Restraint  But Fear of what thou threaten'stand that this Morning  Had left Resentment free nor curs'd my Memory  With that loath'd Life which since 'twas spar'd by thee  Is mine no more against thee  Athelwold  Perish the poor Pretence  That covers thy ConfusionIf aught I did  Had Merit to withhold thy Arm take Notice  That I renounce itI despise thy Gratitude  False as thy BoastingsIf thou want'st yet more  To reinspire thy Rage and wake thy Honour  I will  invent Disgraces  to provoke thee  If in Contempt of thy too weak Resistance  I spar'd thy LifeAgainst my  Mercy  weigh  My Triumph o'er her Innocence who charm'd thee  That  makes the Balance evenOh Thou hast rais'd me  To such a burning such unmaster'd Anger  That I grow base as  thou  artand thy Blood  Will stream in vain to quench it  Leolyn  Rail onI'll wait  'Spite of thy Arrogance I'll waitnor kill thee  Till some new Injury sets free my Rage  And blots out Obligation  Athelwold  Tortures and Fire  Shalt thou inflame me thusUnseat my Soul  Tear out wrong'd Patience from my bleeding Heart  And work me into Tempest Then grow  cool  And insolently mild with Stoick Tameness  Hopethou coud'st stop me in the steepest Fall  Of my whole hurried VengeanceNoif thou wait'st  New Provocation it attends thy Call  This  will enrage thee to renew thy Rashness  Strikes him  And meet the Death I  mean  thee  Leolyn drawing  Yes  That  has done it  Now thou hast freed me from all fond Reluctance  And  sanctified  the Will that  sinn'd  before  They fight  Oswald without  Hasteor we come too late  Enter Guards and beat down their Swords  Athelwold  We are prevented  Leolyn  Then I must wait and groan for Liberty  To thank thee as I ought  Athelwold  For Liberty  Oh doubt it notBy Heaven it  shall  be thine  I will myself find means to force thy Freedom  That I may claim thy Life in just Exchange  Where shall we meet  Softly  Leolyn  West on yon terrass'd Cliff  Athelwold  Expect Deliverance e're an Hour be past  Then hasteand find me there  Enter  Oswald  Oswald  Quickseize Prince  Leolyn  Leolyn  It shall not need my Sword is yours again  Conduct me at your Pleasure  Oswald to the Guards  Lead to the Tower  Exeunt  Leolyn Oswald  and Guards  Athelwold  Be hush'd my Heartforget this rash Man's Rage  And till I meet him next be weak as Woman  For  Ethelinda  comes and brings Reproach  That bows me to the Dust in conscious Shame  Enter  Ethelinda  to  Athelwold  Ethelinda  Cool'd by a short Reflection into Hope  That I mistook your Purpose let me yet say  You are wellmet my Lord  Athelwold  Ohwou'd I were  The Time has been when if we two were met  There was no World beyond us  But now I wander like some fabled Ghost  Trembling and earnest to impart his Secret  Yet wanting Power to speak it  Ethelinda  Such Ghosts they say  Wait to be spoke to first then they reveal  Their dreadful Wills and vanish'Twill be thus  With your proud Heart Soon as I have accus'd you  Cover'd with Shame your Answer will be short  Confus'd and fatal and you will vanish from me  Alas I fear for everLook on me  Athelwold  Raise your fal'n EyesThey once cou'd gaze delighted  And hung their Beams on mine as both were form'd  Of one divided Flame which parted hard  And struggled for ReunionTeach 'em once more  To fix an unmov'd stedfast Look upon me  Hold them thus earnest nor decline their Lids  Till you have answer'd me this one sad Question  What have I done that could deserve from  Athelwold  That he should boast my ruin'd Peace to  Leolyn  Your conscious Eye sinks guiltyMy Lord my Lord  The Virtue that inspires this gen'rous Shame  Had shewn a nobler Influence had it taught you  That Insult always base is doubly so  When he who caus'd the Crime upbraids it too  Athelwold  Can you believe me so deprav'd a Wretch  So lost to Honour Gratitude and Shame  As to be conscious of a purpos'd Guilt  Thus infamously vile  Ethelinda  I do by Heaven  Nay know you guilty for since I saw you last  My Uncle cruelly reproach'd me with it  And told me you proclaim'd it  Athelwold  Proclaim'd it No  I am unhappy but I am not base  It were too long and too perplex'd a Tale  While Misery lies unloaded on my Heart  To undeceive thee nowIf thou believ'st  I am that low unmanly Wretch thou speak'st me  Take this dishonour'd Sword pierce my false Breast  Revenge thy Wrongs and save my Tongue the Shame  Of what it soon must tell thee  Ethelinda  What would'st thou tell me  Thou tremblest and I read some dreadful Meaning  That struggles to break on meWhy wilt thou kneel  There glows a gen'rous Tenderness about thee  Which half absolves thy Purpose and bids me hear thee  With Firmness and with Pity  Athelwold  Oh  Ethelinda  Ethelinda  Out with itspeakWou'dst thou not sayI hate thee  Athelwold  No by my Soul tho' Time has chang'd my Love  'Tis

Thought kind Will and grateful Mem'ry  'Tis Friendship'Tis such Love as Angels feel  Who mix their meeting Firesand  flame  together  Ethelinda  Such was the false the artful Eloquence  That lur'd me to my Ruin But my Heart  Instructed by Distress can now read Meanings  Who that is new in Passion could believe  That this fair Picture of thy faded Love  But proves thou lov'st another  Athelwold  What wilt thou say  When thou shalt hear me own That Fear is just  When I confess abhorrent of Deceit  That Love which seem'd to root my Soul in thee  Has new transplanted it to  Elfrid  's Bosom  You start as if my Guilt were yet a Secret  Tho'  Leolyn  confesses he has told it  For in his illretaining Breast I trusted  The fatal Secret of my double Falshood  Both to my King and thee He should have added  How  I was lostThat Will and Faith and Reason  At once gave Way beneath a Weight of Passion  And against Judgment Honour Love of thee  Fame and Allegiance I was born away  Till she who

gentle Soul  Ethelinda  I pity thee So mean a Stratagem  Shamefully form'd to force me upon  Leolyn  And free thee from the Pain of long dissembling  Go onthat I may teach my Heart to hate thee  This low Contrivance this poor Trick of Art  Is baser than Inconstancy  Athelwold  Sorrow like mine  Sinks the sad Heart too low for Artifice  And my proud Soul outswells and floats above it  That I am lost beyond Redemption lost  My Roof that once grew proud in Hopes of thee  Conceals too clear a WitnessYet may'st  thou  curse me  If I not rev'rence and esteem thee still  With my Heart's inmost Softness Thy Power improves  Ev'n by Defection Lost to my frailer  Sense  My  Soul  adores thee like some nameless Being  In which the Woman mixes with the Angel  And makes a new Divinity  Ethelinda  Thy Words  Thy Looks disorder'd and thy trembling Frame  Fill me with Fear and WonderIt cannot be  Thou should'st thus mov'd and movingly dissemble  By Heav'n I will be satisfy'dThou say'st  This Rival this imaginary  Elfrid  Is now in thy Apartment I will fly thither  And when I have unravel'd all thy Guilt  Let loose Despair at once and die distracted  Athelwold  Oh stayFor Pity's Sake for your own Sake  For mine For the King's Quiet  Ethelinda  I'll not be held  Tho' Kings and Flames and War and Devastation  And Death himself stood threatning  Breaks away and runs off  Edgar without  What hoaLord  Athelwold  Athelwold  'Tis the King's Voice  Edgar  What has thus long disjoin'd thee from my Joy  Hid from thy Sight by the dark Grot between us  Thy Voice took Pity on my Heart's Impatience  And taught me how to trace thee Pomp cou'd not please  While Friendship waited for me Sudden I left  Th' unfinish'd Triumph fill'd with a nobler Joy  And wanting Soul to taste it in thy Absence  But thou art grown a Lover  Athelwold  An angry Lady left theeIs it possible  That the unjudging Sex have Wills so blind  That  Athelwold  in Love can sigh in vain  Punish the peevish Beauty with Neglect  And fly to thy King's Heart for Refuge from her  Athelwold  I blushand am confoundedmy gracious Lord  To be surpriz'd in my unguarded Weakness  By your too piercing EyeYet Woman's Power  Edgar  Teach the tall Pine to bend before the Wind  What has not  Edgar  felt the Power of Woman  They toy with Sceptersand the Frowns of Kings  Serve them to smile at When the wanton Tyrants  Play over their soft Triflings to the Heart  They set their Eyes on Fire to light us up  Then melt us into Warmth that softens Wisdom  And we receive the Stamp their Folly gives us  But why hast thou deceiv'd thy Prince's Trust  Thou art for ever forming some kind Plot  To quicken Pleasure's Relish by Surprize  But I have now detected theeand mean  For once to spoil the Grace of thy Design  And break upon thy Purpose  Athelwold  Royal Sir  If some malicious Foe  Edgar  Yes yes they charge thee  And all thy Guilt lies openBut thy Plottings  Make Loyalty look dull and shame plain Duty  I have unveil'd the Secret Leadto thy Lodgings  When we are there I will convict thee  Athelwold  Of such Designs against thy Sov'reign's Rest  As more than I shall thank thee for  Athelwold aside  Whither will Fortune drag meI am discover'd  And he but puts on Joy to shame my Ruin  With the Contempt of Easiness  Edgar  Yes  Athelwold  Statesmen shall learn from thy deserv'd Renown  From Honours thou shalt owe my strengthen'd Crown  That where the Monarch is not blind of Heart  Affection is the Favourite's wisest Art  While to Selfservers due Contempt is shown  Let Friends who seek our Int'rest

Deportment  Awfully sad or proudly angry Madam  Elfrid  I saw her from the Window She seems much mov'd  And carries in her Face a kind of War  Of Sorrow against Pride that shades yet softens  The Rigour of her Beauty as I have seen  A hovering Cloud obscure too fierce a Sun  And make his Influence sweeterSaid she my Lord  Commissioned her to see me  Lady  Madam she did  On sudden Business of the utmost Consequence  To your own Peace and his  Elfrid  Lookwhat Impatience  She stays not your ReturnWait within Call  Exit  Lady  Enter  Ethelinda  I thought myself so much a Stranger here  That I receive you Madam in Surprize  I may have Cause to blush at when I've learnt  To whom I owe this Favour  Ethelinda  You owe it Madam  To the too liberal Will of one whose Favours  More of your Sex than you have been oblig'd to  So kind a Purposer as  Athelwold  Means much he leaves imperfectYou had rather  He should have come his own Ambassador  Than sent a Representer such as I am  Unqualified to smooth your angry Brow  That frowns cold Welcome at me  Elfrid  I frown indeed  To hear the Name of  Athelwold  pronounc'd  With this familiar LicenceSure You know him  With more than common Intimacy Madam  Who treat him with this Frankness  Ethelinda  If to have been his Intimate  May licence Frankness toward him the Court has Claimers  Who can dispute their Title to your Lover  By Rights of longer Date and juster Tenure  Than those you hold him by  Elfrid  Your Pardon Madam  I find I was mistaken in your Purpose  But 'twas my Woman's Error She inform'd me  You came  from Athelwold  Had she said  for  him  I should have better known with what Respect  To entertain your VisitOn my Word  He was unkind to give a Lady Pain  Who lost him thus reluctantlyYou watch  His first Return to Court with Eye too keen  To be so coldly look'd at  Ethelinda  Though he told me  His Roof conceal'd a Witness of his Guilt  I took you for a Shadow But I perceive  His Falshood may be trusted when he speaks  Of his own BasenessThink me not abrupt  If Oaths had Power to bind he should be mine  Triumphant in the prosperous Pride of Beauty  Your easy Scorn insults the Miserable  Unconscious of their AnguishSense of lost Peace  Perhaps transported an afflicted Heart  And I appear'd too warm  I shall no more invade your wish'd Repose  All I would ask isPardon the dreadful Question  Are you the  Wife  of  Athelwold  Elfrid  The  Wife  What Right of Claim could he presume to  Me  But what that Title gave him  Ethelinda  Farewellfor ever  Kneel and pray Heaven to whose indulgent Hand  You owe Attraction to increase and guard it  Else will your destin'd Ruin soon instruct you  That he who tempted by your Charms betray'd  His Heart's vow'd Mistress and deceiv'd his King  Will for some new Temptation give up you  And leave you subject to another's Pity  As I am now to yours  Elfrid  Stay Madam stay  You have alarm'd me to my inmost Soul  And I adjure you as you hope Return  Of your departed Peace not to go hence  Till you explain the fatal Mystery  Which your last Words were fill'd with  Ethelinda  The Part I bear  In the black Meaning my sad Soul determines  To feel in Silence till I shake it off  To Distance whence it can return no more  For you the King who sent this trusted Favourite  To court you to the Bed of Royal  Edgar  Not that of  Athelwold  The King thus wrong'd  Will punish your false Lover with Revenge  Which amidst all my Agonies I dread  And tremble for  his  Woes who has destroyed me  Elfrid  O my foreboding HeartA thousand Wonders  A thousand Mysteries at once reveal'd  Come rushing on my MemoryNow  Athelwold  No longer is it doubtful to my Thought  Why the King's Eye was judg'd more dangerous  Than Shoals and Rocks and ShipwrecksNow the Mystery  Of Royal  Edgar  's Words so lately heard  Opens unveil'd upon my frighted Soul  And Pain and Terror and Confusion shake me  Oh cruel Undeceiver why have you wak'd me  Why have you torn me from my joyless Calm  Which though it gave no Transport lull'd me in Quiet  And kept these Storms of Life from breaking on me  Enter Lady  Lady  MadamThe King  Elfrid  What would'st thou say  Lady  The King is entring here  And my Lord with himScarce had I Breath to fly  Beforeand give you Notice  Elfrid  Save him kind Heaven  Teach me some Angel to avoid this King  Teach my distracted Heart to 'scape this Precipice  Which Way may we retireYon inmost Door  Opens upon the Gallery  Lady  'Tis lock'd and they are here  Ethelinda  Oh the severe Resolve of righteous Heaven  They comeI tremble for this false Man's Fate  And my unwilling Feet are rooted here  Enter  Edgar  followed by  Athelwold  Edgar  Why dost thou linger  Athelwold  Look here  The Secret thou would'st have withheld yet longer  Shines out like the Sun's Heat to gladden Nature  And make Creation smile  Elfrid  my Queen  Soul of my Kingdom's Hopes my Fame my Glory  Thou art his GiftOh let thy AngelTongue  Join to confirm my Vow to this lov'd Friend  This Friend to whom I owe the sweet Surprize  That I thus gaze upon thee thus approach thee  Lend me thy wish'd Consent to firm this Oath  Which by my Soul's eternal Hopes I swear  That Day and Night shall cease and Time be lost  And Nature's slack'ning Springs unwind the World  E're I forget his Interest in my Heart  Or hold my  Athelwold  less dear than now  Elfrid  Confirm his Oath kind Heav'n  Edgar  Thou saintlike Goodness  How shall my swelling Heart contain this Joy  This overpow'ring GladnessBless'd as I am  Center'd in Happiness 'twixt Love and Friendship  I can look  down  on my neglected Throne  Can see the Pride of Power rise far beneath me  And Heaven has scarce reserv'd one Bliss to wish for  Ethelinda  Oh blind blind Man  Exit disorder'd  Elfrid Aside  Her ardent Sense of Wrongs  Points at her Life and Charity compels me  To save her from herself  Exit Elfrid  Edgar  What mean their Looks  Signals of Terror and disorder'd Partings  Why are they vanish'd thusHa By my Soul  Thou too art touch'd with the contagious Madness  Now has some Devil malignant to thy Truth  Wrought to perplex theeNo Part of Earth I govern  Dares cherish Mischief that could wound  my  Friend  With this quick Sense of Anguish  Athelwold  Oh that all Language  Cou'd be express'd by Looks or that my King  Great Substitute of Heaven could read my Heart  Like that first Power who made it  Edgar  What hast thou suffer'd  I think I should have said what hast thou done  But that I speak to  Athelwold  Athelwold  How base  How like a Coward fighting blind is he  Who dares commit the Crime he dares not own  And bold enough to know  himself  a Villain  Fears least  Another  knows it  Edgar  StopSay no more  Art not thou  Athelwold  Let me look on thee  NoBy thy sacred Empire in my Heart  It cannot beI am at Peace again  Go onthy Enemies in vain accus'd thee  But thy own Words alarm'd meYet my glad Eyes  Have trac'd thee over and absolve that Form  Even from the Power to harbour a mean Mind  Unsuited and deceitful  Athelwold  What can I say  Guilt when it meets Suspicion or Reproach  Sustains itself within and learns to balance  Offence by Punishment But where it finds  Compassion and has wrong'd a gen'rous Confidence  It ought to blush in Blood and has no Way  To Pardon or to Peace but thisthrough Death  Edgar Disarming him  Hold thy rash HandAnd like  my  Subject learn  To die when I command theeCan it be possible  One brave as Thou art shou'd have Guilt to justify  This Fear of a Friend's EyeIs  Elfrid  mine  Or trusted with the Wants that press'd my Soul  Hast thou instead of giving robb'd me of more  And left thy Prince a Bankrupt Unbless'd by Love  And yet depriv'd of Friendship  Athelwold  What has not Love  Made Honour guilty ofTurn Royal Sir  Turn your Eyes inward and in  Emma  's Tears  Read the too fatal Power of  Elfrid  's Beauty  How cou'd weak  Athelwold  expect to conquer  Where godlike  Edgar  fell  Edgar  Heav'n 'tis Thy Hand  When Subjects thus from Prince's Crimes grow bold  To charge their Treasons on their King's Example  And shame us into JusticeTrue I have err'd  But mark what Difference 'twixt my Guilt and that  Which thou nor dar'st to speak nor I to hear  By  Elfrid  won from  Emma  Love in me  Prov'd but too strong for Love In thee not Love  To Love was treacherousBut Love to Honour  To Friendship Loyalty to sworn Obedience  To all the violated Laws of Life  What Subject though unfavour'd dares invade  His Sovereign's ClaimBut when that Subject is  A Servant too bound by the double Tie  Of Duty and Allegiance when beyond all  His King his Master whom he wrongs selected him  Treasur'd his Hopes and Wishes in his Heart  Liv'd in his Breast partial but in  his  Cause  And against warring Worlds wou'd have defended him  What can that faithless Traitor's Reason urge  To match his Guilt with mine  Enter  Elfrid  hastily  Elfrid  Oh  Athelwold  The injur'd Stranger strong by Despair's wild Rage  Breaks like a Tempest from your Servant's Care  And meditates Destruction No Voice but yours  Will calm her into PatienceIn her Heart's Anguish  She calls on  Athelwold  till Shrieks of Woe  Eccho from Tower to Tower your Fatal Name  And the wide Castle rings with her Reproaches  Edgar  Goand appease her Grief thou Source of Sorrow  Free my dim'd Eyes from aching at thy Presence  And leave me to the Pain of sharp Reflection  What thou should'st suffer from a Prince's Hand  Who is this Wretch by thine  Exit Athelwold  Too fatal Beauty  Why have I  found  thee but to lose thee more  And change a painful Hope for certain Misery  Elfrid  If in your royal Heart I hold such Influence  Abate your Wonder at my Power in  Athelwold  's  Why were you Friends but that your Souls had Sympathy  And purpos'd each like other'Tis scarce a Moment  Since I first learn'd that when he press'd his Passion  He wrong'd his Sov'reign's Meaning Yet already  I find the Fault most yoursLove is a Leveller  And all Degrees are equall'd where he reigns  Why was another sent if  Edgar  lov'd me  Why was not  Cornwall  honour'd by your Presence  When your unnumber'd Navy swept her Coasts  In your last Guardian CircuitHad you then landed  Indulgent to my loyal Father's Prayer  From what a dreadful Length of destin'd Woe  Had my sad Heart been guarded  Edgar  I saw thee first  Unknowing thou wer't  Elfrid  at the dread Altar  Where from our aweful  Dunstan  's holy Hands  The consecrated Oil confirm'd me King  How wer't thou lost so soon  Elfrid  Swear but to pardon  The gen'rous tho' unfaithful  Athelwold  And I will shew you we were doom'd unhappy  But by the Will of Heav'n  Edgar  Kings shou'd be just  And such compulsive Oaths too lightly sworn  Make That Necessity which might be Choice  And strip the Grace from Mercy  Elfrid  Then hear  my  Vow  Since you decline to bind your doubtful Will  Thus on my Knees allpowerful Heav'n my Soul  Appeals thy righteous ThroneHearand afflict me  With every woful Curse thy Wrath has stor'd  For Perjury if ever I consent  To quit the Breast or Claim of  Athelwold  Or should he fall by your revenging Hand  If I not shun for ever even to Death  The Sight the Voice the Name of Royal  Edgar  Edgar  Cruel cold proud disdainfulglorious  Elfrid  What has thy Rashness swornYet let me perish  If to have sworn it has not made thy Loveliness  As awful as DivinityWas ever  Distress thus hopeless Could your untouch'd Heart  Have Sense of what mine suffers you wou'd have fear'd  To wound me with this Pain of fix'd Despair  Elfrid  Now shielded by the Safeguard of my Oath  Virtue may speak secure and own its Weakness  There was a Time e'er  Athelwold  was mine  When to have been the Wife of uncrown'd  Edgar  Wou'd have been more than Monarchy to  Elfrid  Fatally curious from the deep Impression  Of an alarming Dream I saw you crown'd  Hid in a clam'rous Press that shouted round me  And shook the sacred Dome with Peals of Joy  Edgar  Oh tell it me againWas I so bless'd  That you then thought with Tenderness on  Edgar  What was that Dream Charm me thou rising Wonder  With each soft Circumstance of pleasing Pain  For while I die with Terror of my Fate  'Tis Heav'n to hear it from a Voice like thine  Elfrid  Oh sooth not MiseryForbear to speak  With this untimely this forbidden Softness  Aw'd by Rememb'rance of my dreadful Dream  I tremble ign'rant of the Will of Heaven  Too dimly gleam'd upon my distant Soul  I dreamt I sat and saw th' Imperial Crown  Plac'd on your sacred Head Your Form the same  As when I after view'd you at the Altar  And fainting with Reflection left the Throng  Soon as the Diadem adorn'd your Brow  You turn'd methought with Brightness more than mortal  Held it presented thus and high in Air  Stept to the Seat that bore me When strait a cold  A shadowy Hand divided us Loud Shrieks  Rung thro' the Temple The gay Pomp was darken'd  And a broad Sea of Blood rose high between us  And bore us from each other  Edgar  Thy ominous Dream  Creeps in cold Tides and curdles all my Veins  Seek we thou lost Inflamer of Desire  The false the fated  Athelwold  My Heart  Heaves with unusual Bodings Powerful Pity  Struggles with Justice and 'tis more painful to me  To think my Friend should fall to  need  Forgiveness  Than to forgive my  Enemy  Elfrid  This is indeed  To reign So reigns the World's supreme Disposer  All Things but one are subject to his Power  But even his Pow'r itself obeys his Mercy  Proud of Dominion yet enslav'd to Fear  Kings who love Blood thro' one long Tempest steer  While the calm Monarch who with Smiles controuls  Roots his safe Empire and is King of Souls  Edgar  When Woman form'd to soften Man to Peace  Fans his Disquiet and gives Care Increase  Love is a Weakness and to wish in vain  Were a forc'd Freedom and Escape from Pain  But where our Hearts are charm'd by Forms like thee  Where Passions sympathize and Souls agree  There to love hopeless is in Life to die  And languid in void Blanks of Being lie  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE The Garden  ETHELINDA alone  Ethelinda  OH Shame Why keep'st

Exit Athelwold  Edgar Alone  How shall I move in this dark Maze of Passion  'Tis true my Favourite has betray'd me basely  But he was first himself betray'd by Love  That Tyrant of the Heart more King than I  Ranks Monarchs with his SlavesLet me weigh  Athelwold  By my own Wishes and then punish  him  When I can see unmov'd those Eyes which charm'd him  How shall I act at once to shield my Fame  And satisfy my LoveCou'd Reason's Force  Tear the unlicens'd Image from my Heart  Or patient leave to Time th'unhasten'd Means  To bless my fierce Desires Who knows what Chance  Or Death or Thought or Woman's changeful Will  Or my own conquer'd Wishes may produce  Kings should however injur'd do no Wrong  They cannot err  alone  since what They act  They authorize in othersLet me then  Extinguish low Desires lest at  my  Flame  I light a Nation's WishesI will strive  To check this rising Passion and forget  That she who charms me thus is in my Power  Till I can bend that Pow'r to Reason's Rule  They comeI will avoid themand reflect  What Measures to resolve on  Exit Edgar  Reenter  Athelwold  followed by  Leolyn  Leolyn  Turnwhither would'st thou lead me  Athelwold  In this Place  But now I left the KingA little farther  And we shall find him soon  Leolyn  Stayfor we find  In these provided Swords what well reminds us  Of our late PartingThou hast perform'd thy Promise  With Bravery so noble that again  'Spite of my burning Wrongs I almost love thee  It cannot need that I shou'd spur thy Will  To what remains unfinish'd  Taking up a Sword  Athelwold  I had forgot it  Guilt and Repentance and the Tears of Shame  Had wash'd the Indignation from my Heart  Methinks we were not born for Enemies  Enough already have we wrong'd our Friendship  Let us be Foes no more  Leolyn  First perish  Leolyn  Didst thou not blast my Honour by a Blow  Fir'd with a Ruffian's Boldness strike a Prince  And can he live to pardonShame to thy Heart  Or give my Glory the Revenge it claims  Or I will brand thee with a Coward's Marks  And teach light Boys to scorn thee  Athelwold  If it must be  Spare me a Moment's Pause'Twill soon be past  And Death will want to Time to sate his Purpose  What shall I doTo trust him with my Softness  To tell him what at my Request the King  Was won to grant him were to seem afraid  And shrink from his RevengeO fatal Chain  Of long depending Woes that Guilt is bound to  Conflicting Passions blast the bad Man's Hopes  And all his Thoughts are Whirlwind  Leolyn  Come on  Thy Blow burns hot and I will wait no longer  Athelwold  Hold  Leolyn  Be slowThe Chance of Conquest  Is various and unknownand shou'd I fall  Thou wilt have Cause to grieve thou didst not hear me  Leolyn  Nevertill Vengeance has been paid its Full  Never will I grow tame and hear thee more  Athelwold Taking up the other Sword  Take thy own Way thenLet Destruction fall  And find thee without ShelterBut see the King  His comingin this Place prevents our Purpose  On to th' appointed TerrasFollow me  Exeunt together  Reenter  Edgar  with an Officer  Edgar  What  Oswald  told me of a second Quarrel  Renews my Anger against  Leolyn  And wakes me into Fear of some new Consequence  From his EnlargementTake a Guard and bring him  To answer this Presumption  Exit Officer  Enter  Oswald  Oswald  Oh SirUnhappy  Ethelinda  rests  Her Sorrows are no more  Edgar  What has Fate done  Oswald  See Sir Yon Terras which o'erhangs the Sea  Thence falling steep at once the frighted Eye  Akes down a Depth of Rocks to reach the Surge  That breaks unheard belowThere walking swift  With frantick Action in a long loud Speech  The poor distress'd Complainer talk'd and wept  To the wild Oceani told the Waves her Woes  And list'ning earnest oft in dumb Suspence  Paus'd for an Answer'Till at last more shrill  She scream'd Resentment to the distant Deep  Thou art she cry'd as cold and deaf as  Athelwold  Then sudden from her Breast in rash Despair  Snatching a DaggerShe with all the Rage  Of a resolv'd Destruction plung'd it thrice  In her distracted Bosom  Edgar  Alas for  Athelwold  How will he meet this Sight  Reenter Officer and Guards with  Leolyn  Edgar  Answer me quicklywhere is  Athelwold  Leolyn  Immortaland at Peace  Edgar  What  Hast thou murder'd him  Ungrateful and detested Murder'd  Him  Him who alone obtain'd thy Freedom from me  And in the gen'rous Anguish of his Guilt  Pray'd that his Titles and his forfeit Lands  Might all be  Thine  whom as he wrong'd in Life  He could not rest in Death to leave unhappy  Leolyn  This had been Daggers to my guilty Soul  Could he have fall'n by meBut like a God  Who smiles and pardons when provok'd by Mortals  He met my Rage with a serene Contempt  Master'd a second time my failing Sword  And gave me Life in PunishmentLive  Leolyn  He cry'd and spoke it with an Air unmov'd  Superior  not  insultingLiveand know  That had not conscious guilt a Point more strong  Than thineNo Wound could reach the Breast of  Athelwold  Yet tho' he will not be  compell'd  to  die  He chuses  not  to livefor he has wrong'd thee  Come and see Justice done theeAt that Instant  The Shock of  Ethelinda  's dreadful Fate  Heard as we pass'd upon th' extended Terras  Alarm'd his Care too lateI saw him Sir  Edgar  Go on  Leolyn  I saw him Sir as I drew near  Raise his fall'n Victim from the bloody Ground  And on his Cheek support her bending Head  But her weak Joints soft sinking from their Trust  She hung sustain'd and bled upon his Bosom  He groan'dlook'd wildcall'd loud upon her Name  And for a Moment stopt her flying Soul  Twice at his Voice she stretch'd her dying Eyes  And gasp'dand struggl'dand wou'd fain have spoke  But failingin a short convulsive Sigh  Breath'd out her Souland sunk upon his Bosom  Hestanding near the downfal of the Cliff  Strain'd her with Rapture in his circling Arms  O  Leolyn  he cry'd forgive me  now  Tell the wrong'd King I leave his  Elfrid  free  And thus too late do Right to  Ethelinda  Then springing furious o'er the dreadful Rock  Leap'd with the Dead to DeathTogether both  Fell frightful to the Deep which closing o'er them  Veils them from Sense of Woe in Rest forever  Edgar  Great was his Guilt and  greatly  'tis aton'd  Nothing is safe but InnocenceBe it your Care  To send out Boats that their recover'd Bodies  May rest beneath one Marble over which  I will erect a Cloister and endow it  For hourly Prayers to Heaven to rest their Souls  Haste all and watch th' afflicted  Elfrid  near  Assist herguard herwait at her Apartment  And save her from her Sorrow  Oh  Leolyn  be obstinately just  Indulge no Passion and deceive no Trust  Let never Man be bold enough to say  Thus and no farther shall my Passion stray  The first Crime past compells us into more  And Guilt grows  Fate  that was but  Choice  before  FINIS
