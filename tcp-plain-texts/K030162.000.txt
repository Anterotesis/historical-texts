 WIVES AS THEY WERE AND MAIDS AS THEY ARE A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY MRS INCHBALD  DUBLIN PRINTED FOR P WOGAN OLDBRIDGE  PROLOGUE  BY A FRIEND  SPOKEN BY Mr WADDY  I COME not to announce a bashful maid  Who ne'er has try'd the drama's doubtful trade  Who sees with flutt'ring hope the curtain rise  And scans with timid glance your critic eyes  My client is a more experienc'd dame  Tho' not a Veteran not unknown to Fame  Who think your favours are an honest boast  Yet fears to forfeit what she values most  Who has she trusts some character to lose  E'en tho' the woman did not aid the Muse  Who courts with modest aim the public smile  That stamp of merit and that meed of toil  At Athens once our author has been told  The Comic Muse irregularly bold  With living calumny profan'd her stage  And forg'd the frailties of the faultless sage  Such daring ribaldry you need not fear  We have no Socrates to libel here  Ours are the follies of an humbler flight  Offspring of manners volatile and light  Our gen'ral satire keeps more knaves in awe  Our court of conscience comes in aid of law  Here scourg'd by wit and pilloried by fun  Ten thousand  coxcombs blush instead of  one  If scenes like these could make the guilty shrink  Could teach unfeeling Folly how to think  Check Affectation's voluble career  And from cold Fashion force the struggling tear  Our author would our loudest praise forego  Content to feel within "what passes show"  "But since" she says "such hopes cannot be mine  "Such bold pretensions I must needs resign  "Tell these great judges of dramatic laws  "Their reformation were my best applause  "Yet if the heart my proud appeal withstands  "I ask the humbler suffrage of their hands"  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN

Sir  WILLIAM DORRILLON  and Mr  NORBERRY  Mr  NORBERRY  WHY blame meWhy blame meMy sister had the sole management of your daughter by your own authority from the age of six years till within eight months of the present time when in consequence of my sister's death she was transferred to my protection  Sir Wil  Your sister Mr Norberry was a prudent good womanshe never could instruct her in all this vice  Mr Nor  Depend upon it my dear friend that Miss Dorrillon your daughter came to my house just the same heedless woman of fashion you now see her  Sir Wil  impatiently  Very well'Tis very wellBut when I think on my disappointment  Mr Nor  There is nothing which may not be repaired Maria with you for a guide  Sir Wil  Me She turns me into ridiculelaughs at me This morning as she was enumerating some of her frivolous expences she observed me lift up my hands and sigh on which she named fifty other extravagances she had no occasion to mention merely to enjoy the pang which every solly of her sends to my heart  Mr Nor  But do not charge this conduct of your daughter to the want of filial lovedid she know you were sir William Dorrillon did she know you were her father every word you uttered every look you glanced would be received with gentleness and submissionbut your present rebukes from Mr Mandred as you are called from a perfect stranger as she supposes she considers as an impertinence which she has a right to resent  Sir Wil  I wish I had continued abroad And yet the hope of beholding her and of bestowing upon her the riches I acquired was my sole support through all the toils by which I gained them  Mr Nor  And considering her present course of life your riches could not come more opportunely  Sir Wil  She shall never have a farthing of them Do you think I have encountered the perils of almost every climate to squander my hardearned fortune upon the paltry vicious pleasures in which she delights NoI have been now in your house exactly a monthI will stay but one day longerand then without telling her who I am I will leave the kingdom and her for everNor shall she know that this insignificant merchant whom she despises was her father till he is gone never to be recalled  Mr Nor  You are offended with some justice but as I have often told you your excessive delicacy and respect for the conduct of the other sex degenerate into rigour  Sir Wil  Truefor what I see so near perfection as woman I want to see perfect  We  Mr Norberry can never be perfect but surely women women might easily be made angels  Mr Nor  And if they were we should soon be glad to make them into women again  Sir William  inattentive to Mr Norberry  She sets the example  She  gives the fashionand now your Whole house and all your visitors in imitation of  her  treat me with levity or with contemptBut I'll go away tomorrow  Mr Nor  Can you desert your child in the moment she wants your protection That exquisite beauty just now become mature  Sir Wil  There's my difficultyThere's my struggleIf she were not so like her mother I could leave her without a pangcast hey off and think no more of herBut that shape that face those speaking looks Yet how reversedWhere is the diffidence the humilitywhere is the simplicity of my beloved wife Buried in her grave  Mr Nor  And in all this great town you may never see even its apparition  Sir Wil  I rejoice however at the stratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart deprived by the means of searching it in her early years had I at present come as her father she might have deceived me with counterfeit manners till time disclosed the impositionNow at least I am not imposed upon  Enter Servant  Ser  Lord Priory  Exit  Sir Wil  Lord Priory  Mr Nor  An old acquaintance of mine though we seldom meet He has some singularities and yet perhaps  Enter Lord Priory  Mr Nor  My dear Lord I am glad to see you Mr Mandred  introducing Sir Willian  My Lord I hope I see you in perfect health  Lord Pri  Yes but in very ill humour I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter and found my house after going through only a slight repair so damp that I dare not sleep in it and so I am now sending and going all over the town to seek for lodgings  Mr Nor  Then seek no farther but take up your lodgings here  Lord Pri  To be plain with you I called in hopes you would ask me for I am so delicately scrupulous in respect to lady Priory that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel  Mr Nor  Then pray return home and bring her hither immediately with all your luggage  Lord Pri  I am most extremely obliged to you  very fervently  for into no one house belonging to any of my acquaintance would I take my wife so soon as into yours I have now been married eleven years and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a visit so as to domesticate in the house of a married man  Sir Wil  May I enquire the reason of that  Lord Pri  It is because I am married myself and having always treated my wife according to the ancient mode of treating wives I would rather she should never be an eyewitness to the modern household management  Sir Wil  The ancients I believe were very affectionate to their wives  Lord Pri  And they had reason to be so for their wives obeyed them The ancients seldom gave them the liberty to do wrong but modern wives do as they like  Mr Nor  And don't you suffer Lady Priory to do as she likes  Lord Pri  Yes when it is what I like too But never never else  Sir Wil  Does not this draw upon you the character of an unkind husband  Lord Pri  That I am proud of Did you never observe that seldom a breach of fidelity in a wise is exposed where the unfortunate husband is not said to be "the best creature in the world Poor man so goodnaturedDoatingly fond of his wifeIndulged her in every thingHow cruel in her to serve him so" Now if I am served  so  it shall not be for my goodnature  Mr Nor  But I hope you equally disapprove of every severity  Lord Pri  rapidly  What do you mean by severity  Mr Nor  You know you used to be rather violent in your temper  Lord Pri  So I am stillapt to be hasty and passionate  but that is rather of advantage to me as a husbandit causes me to be obeyed without hesitationno liberty for contention tears or repining I insure conjugal sunshine by now and then introducing a storm while some husbands never see any thing but a cloudy sky and all for the want of a little domestic thunder to clear away the vapours  Sir Wil  I have long conceived indulgenee to be the bane of female happiness  Lord Pri  And so it isI know several women of fashion who will visit six place of different amusement on the same night have company at home besides and yet for want of something more they'll be out of spirits my wife never goes to a public place has scarce ever company at home and yet is always in spirits  Sir Wil  Never visits operas or balls or routs  Lord Pri  How should she She goes to bed every night exactly at ten  Mr Nor  In the name of wonder how have you been able to bring her to that  Lord Pri  By making her rise every morning at five  Mr Nor  And so she becomes tired before night  Lord Pri  Tired to death Or if I see her eyes completely open at bedtime and she asks me to play one game more at piquet the next morning I jog her elbow at half after four  Mr Nor  But suppose she does not reply to the signal  Lord Pri  Then I turn the key of the door when I leave the chamber and there I find her when I come home in the evening  Sir Wil  And without her having seen a creature all day  Lord Pri  This is in my favour for not having seen a single soul she is rejoiced even to see  me  Mr Nor  And will she speak to you after such usage  Lord Pri  If you only considered how much a woman longs to speak after being kept a whole day silent you would not ask that question  Mr Nor  Well this is the most surprising method  Lord Pri  Not at all In ancient days when manners were simple and pure did not wives wait at the table of their husbands and did not angels witness the subordination I have taught Lady Priory to practise the same humble docile obedienceto pay respect to her husband in every shape and every form no careless inattention to  me  no smiling politeness to others in preference to  me  no putting  me  up in a cornerin all assemblies she considers her husband as the first person  Sir Wil  I am impatient to see her  Lord Pri  But don't expect a fine lady with high feathers and the  et caetera  of an Eastern concubine you will see a modest plain English woman with a cap on her head a handkerchief on her neck and a gown of our own manufacture  Sir Wil  My friend Norberry what a contrast must there be between Lady Priory and the ladies in this house  Lord Pri  starting  Have you ladies in this house  Mr Nor  Don't be alarmed they are both single and can give Lady Priory no ideas concerning the marriage state  Lord Pri  Are you sure of that Some single women are more informed than their friends believe  Mr Nor  For these ladies notwithstanding a few what  you  would call excesses I will answer  Lord Pri  Well then I and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening you know we go tobed at ten  Mr Nor  But remember you bring your own servants to wait on you at five in the morning  Lord Pri  I shall bring but onemy old servant Oliver who knows all my customs so well that I never go any where without him  Mr Nor  And is that old servant your valet still  Lord Pri  No he is now a kind of gentleman in waiting I have had no employment for a valet  since I marriedmy wife for want of dissipation has not only time to attend upon herself but upon me Do you think I could suffer a clumsy man to tie on my neckcloth or comb out my hair when the soft delicate and tender hands of my wife are at my command  Exit  Sir Wil  After this amiable description of a woman how can I endure to see her whom reasons bids me detest but whom nature still  Mr Nor  Here she comes and her companion in folly along with her  Sir Wil  There's another woman that Lady Mary Raffle How can you suffer such people in your house  Mr Nor  She is only on a visit for a few monthsshe comes every winter as her family and mine have long been intimately connected  Sir Wil  Let us go Let us go I can't bear the sight of them  Going  Mr Nor  Stay and for  once  behave with politeness and good humour to your daughterdoand I dare venture my life she will neither insult nor treat you with disrespect You know you always begin first  Sir Wil  Have not I a right to begin first  Mr Nor  But that is a right of which she is ignorant  Sir Wil  And deserves to be so and ever shall be so  I  stay and treat her with politeness and good humour  Norather let her kneel and implore my pardon  Mr Nor  Suffer me to reveal who you are and so she will  Sir Wil  If you expose me only by the insinuation to her knowledge our friendship is that moment at an end  Mr Nor  Firmly  I have already given you my promise on that subject and you may rely upon it  Sir Wil  I thank youI believe youand I thank you  Exeunt Sir  William  and Mr  Norberry  Enter Lady  Mary Raffle  and Miss  Dorrillon  Miss Dor  Stealing on as Mr  Norberry  and Sir  William  leave the stage  They are gone Thank heaven they are gone out of this room for I expect a dozen visiters and Mr Norberry looks so gloomy upon me he puts me out of spirits while that Mandred's peevishness is not to be borne  Lady M  Be satisfied for you were tolerably severe upon him this morning in your turn  Miss Dor  Why I am vextand I don't like to be found fault with in my best humour much less when I have so many things to tease me  Lady M  What are they  Miss Dor  I have now lost all my money and all my jewels at play it is almost two years since I have received a single remittance from my father and Mr Norberry refuses to advance me a shilling moreWhat I shall do to discharge a debt which must be paid either today or tomorrow heaven knowsDear Lady Mary you could lend me a small sum could you  Lady M  Who I  with surprise  My dear creature it was the very thing I was going to ask of you for when you have money I know no one so willing to disperse it among her friends  Miss Dor  Am not II protest I love to part with my money for I know with what pleasure I receive it myself and I like to see that joy sparkle in another's eye which has so often brightened my own But last night ruined meI must have money somewhereAs you can't assist me I must ask Mr Norberry for his carriage and immediately go in search of some friend that can lend me four or five or six or seven hundred pounds But the worst is I have lost my creditIs not that dreadful  Lady M  Yes yes I know what it is  Shaking her head  Miss Dor  What will become of me  Lady M  Why don't you marry and throw all misfortunes upon your husband  Miss Dor  Why don't  you  marry For you have as many to throw  Lady M  But not so many lovers who would be willing to receive the load I have no Sir George Evelyn with ten thousand pounds a yearno Mr Bronzely  Miss Dor  If you have not now you once had for I am sure Bronzely once paid his addresses to you  Lady M  And you have the vanity to suppose you took him from me  Miss Dor  SilenceReserve your anger to defend and not to attack me We should be allies by the common ties of poverty and 'tis time to arm for here's the enemy  Enter  Sir William  with  Mr Norberry  Sir Wil  They are here full  Aside to Mr  Norberry  and offering to go back  Mr Nor  Preventing him  No no  Miss Dor  I have been waiting here Mr Norberry to ask a favour of you  He and Sir  William  come forward  Will you be so kind as to lend me your carriage for a couple of hours  Mr Nor  Mr Mandred  pointing to Sir  William  asked me for it to take him into the city  Lady M  Oh Mr Mandred will give it up to Miss Dorrillon I am sure he can defer his business till tomorrow  Sir Wil  No Madam she may as well put off hers I have money to receive and I can't do it  Miss Dor  I have money to pay and I can't do it  Lady M  If one is going to receive and the other to pay money I think the best way is for you to go together and then what deficiency there is on one side the other may supply  Miss Dor  Will you consent Mr MandredCome do and I'll be friends with you  Sir Wil  "She'll be friends with me"  Miss Dor  Will you  Sir Wil  No  Miss Dor  Well I certainly can ask a favour of Mr Mandred better than I can of any person in the world  Mr Nor  Why so Maria  Miss Dor  Because instead of pain I can see it gives him pleasure to refuse me  Sir Wil  I never confer a favour of the most trivial kind where I have no esteem  Miss Dor  proudly  Nor would I receive a favour of the most trivial kind from one who has not liberality to esteem me  Mr Nor  Come Miss Dorrillon do not grow serious laugh as much as you please but say nothing that  Sir Wil  To her impatiently  From whom then can you ever receive favours except from the vain the idle and the depravedfrom those whose lives are passed in begging them of others  Miss Dor  They are the persons who know best how to be on them for my part had I not sometimes felt what it was to want a friend I might never have had humanity to be the friend of another  Enter  Servant  Ser  Sir George Evelyn  Mr Nor  And pray my dear whose friend have you ever been  Enter  Sir George Evelyn  Not Sir George Evelyn's I am sure and yet he of all others deserves your friendship most  Miss Dor  But friendship will not content him as soon as he thought he had gained that  Sir Geo  He aspired to the supreme happiness of your love  Miss Dor  Now you talk of "supreme happiness" have you provided tickets for the fête on Thursday  Sir Geo  I have provided you have obtained Mr Norberry's leave to go  Mr Nor  That I cannot grant  Miss Dor  Nay my dear Sir do not force me to go without it  Sir Wil  with violence  Would you dare  Miss Dor  looking with surprise  "Would I dare" Mr Mandredand what have  you  to say if I do  Sir Wil  Recollecting himself  I was only going to say that if you did and I were Mr Norberry  Miss Dor  And if you  were  Mr Norberry and treated me in the manner you now do depend upon it I should not think your approbation or disapprobation your pleasure or displeasure of the slightest consequence  Sir Wil  greatly agitated  I dare say notI dare say not Good morning Sir GeorgeI dare say notGood morning Mr Norberry  Going  Mr Nor  Stop a momentMaria you have offended Mr Mandred  Miss Dor  He has offended me  Sir Wil  at the door going off  I shan't offend you long  Mr Norberry  going to him and taking him by the arm  Stay Mr Mandred Miss Dorrillon make an apology Mr Mandred is my friend and you must not treat him with this levity  Lady M  No no apology  Miss Dor  No no apology But I'll tell you what I'll do  Goes up to Sir William  If Mr Mandred likes I'll shake hands with himand we'll be good friends for the future But then don't find fault with meI can't bear it You don't like to be found fault with yourselfYou look as cross as any thing every time I say the least word against you Come shake hands and don't let us see one another's failings for the future  Sir Wil  There is no future for the trial  Miss Dor  How do you mean  Mr Nor  Mr Mandred sets off again for India tomorrow  Miss Dor  Indeed I thought he was come to live in England I am sorry you are going  Sir Wil  with earnestness  Why sorry  Miss Dor  Because we have so frequently quarrelled I am always unhappy when I am going to be parted from a person with whom I have disagreed  I often think I could part with less regret from a friend  Sir G  Not I suppose if the quarrel is forgiven  Miss Dor  Ah but Mr Mandred does not forgive no in his looks I can always see resentmentSometimes indeed I have traced a spark of kindness and have gently tried to blow it to a little flame of friendship when with one hasty puff I have put it out  Sir Wil  You are right It isI believeextinguished  Exit Mr  Norberry  following  Sir Geo  A very singular man  Lady M  Oh If he was not rich there would be no bearing himIndeed he seems to have lost all his friends for during the month he has been here I never found he had any one acquaintance out of this house  Miss Dor  And what is very strange he has taken an aversion to meBut it is still more strange that although I know he has yet in my heart I like  him  He is morose to an insufferable degree but then when by chance he speaks kind you cannot imagine how it soothes meHe wants compassion and all the tender virtues and yet I frequently think that if any serious misfortune were to befall me he would be the first person to whom I should fly to complain  Lady M  Then why don't you fly and tell him of your misfortune last night  Sir Geo  starting  What misfortune  Miss Dor  to lady Mary  Hush  Lady M  A loss at play  To Miss Dor  I beg your pardon but it was out before you said hush  Sir Geo  Ah Maria will you still risk your own and my happiness  Miss Dor  Your happiness and mine SirI beg you will not place them so near to each other  Sir Geo  Mine is so firmly fixed on you it can only exist in yours  Lady M  Then when she is married to Mr Bronzely you will be happy because she will be so  Sir Geo  Bronzely has he dared  Miss Dor  Have not  you  dared Sir  Lady M  But I believe Mr Bronzely is the most daring of the two  aside to Sir Geo  take care of him  Exit  Sir Geo  Miss Dorrillon I will not affront you by supposing that you mean seriously to receive the addresses of Mr Bronzely but I warn you against giving others who know you less than I do occasion to think so  Miss Dor  I never wish to deceive any oneI do admit of Mr Bronzely's addresses  Sir Geo  Why he is the professed lover of your friend Lady Mary or granting he denies it and that I even pass over the frivolity of the coxcomb still he is unworthy of you  Miss Dor  He says the same of you and half a dozen more say exactly the same of each other If you like I'll discard every one of you as unworthy but if I retain you I will retain the rest Which do you choose  Sir Geo  I submit to any thing rather than the total loss of youBut remember that your felicity  Miss Dor  "Felicity felicity"ah that is a word not to be found in the vocabulary of my sensations  sighing  Sir Geo  I believe you and have always regarded you with a compassion that has augmented my love In your infancy deprived of the watchful eye and anxious tenderness of a mother the manly caution and authority of a father misled by the brilliant vapour of fashion surrounded by enemies in the garb of friendsAh do you weep blessed blessed be the signSuffer me to dry those tears I have caused and to give you a knowledge of true felicity  Miss Dor  recovering  I am very angry with myselfDon't I beg tell Mr Norberry or Mr Mandred you saw me crythey'll suppose I have  been move indiscreet  stifling her tears  than I really have For in reality I have nothing  Sir Geo  Do not endeavour to conceal from me what my tender concern for you has given me the means to become acquainted with I know you are plunged in difficulties by your father neither sending nor coming as you once expected I know you are still deeper plunged by your fondness for play  Miss Dor  Very well Sir proceed  Sir Geo  Thus thenSuffer me to send my steward to you this morning he shall regulate your accounts and place them in a state that shall protect you from further embarrassment till your father sends to you or protect you from his reproaches should he arrive  Miss Dor  Sir George I have listened to your detail of vices which I acknowledge with patience with humilitybut your suspicion of those which I have  not  I treat with pride with indignation  Sir Geo  How suspicion  Miss Dor  What part of my conduct Sir has made you dare to suppose I would extricate myself from the difficulties that surround me by the influence I hold over the weakness of a lover  Exeunt separately  ACT II  SCENE I  Another Apartment at  Mr Norberry's  Enter two Porters from an upper Entrance bringing in Trunks  Lord Priory  and  Mr Norberry

Norberry's invitation and am come to him with all my luggage  Enter  Oliver  with a small box in each hand  Lord Pri  Follow those men with the trunks Oliver  Mr Nor  Ah Mr Oliver how do you do  Oli

ladyship will find my house so little inconvenient to you as to induce you to make no very short visit  Lady Pri  I have no doubt Sir but I shall find from your friendship every comfort in this house which it is possible for me to enjoy out of my own  Enter  Lady Mary Raffle  and  Miss Dorrillon  Mr Nor  introducing them  Lady PrioryLady Mary RaffleMiss DorrillonLord Priory  Lady M  Permit me Lady Priory to take you to the next room we are going to have tea immediately  Lady Pri  I have drank tea Madam  Miss Dor  Already It is only nine o'clock  Lady Pri  Then it is near my hour of going to bed  Lord Priory Sir William  and  Mr Norberry  retire to the back of the stage and talk apart  Lady M  Go to bed already In the name of wonder what time did you rise this morning  Lady Pri  Why I do think it was almost six o'clock  Lady M  in amaze  And were you up at six this morning  Lady Pri  Yes  Miss Dor  At six in the month of January  Lady M  It is not light till eight and what good now could you possibly be doing for two hours by candlelight  Lady Pri  Pray Lady Mary at what time did you go to bed  Lady M  About three this morning  Lady Pri  And what good could you possibly be doing for eleven hours by candlelight  Lady M  Good It's as much as can be expected from a woman of fashion if she does no  Lady Pri  But I should fear you woul  deal of harm to your health your spirits and the tranquillity of your mind  Mr Norberry  goes off  Lord Priory  and  Sir William  come forward  Lady M  Oh my Lord Priory I really find all the accounts I have heard of your education for a wife to be actually trueand I can't help laughing to think if you and I had chanced to have married together what a different creature you most likely would have made of me to what I am at present  Lord Pri  Yes and what a different creature you most likely would have made of  me  to what I am at present  Sir Wil  Lady Priory I am not accustomed to pay compliments or to speak my approbation even when praise is a just tribute but your virtues compel me to an eulogium That wise submission to a husband who loves you that chearful smile so expressive of content and that plain dress which indicates the elegance as well as the simplicity of your mind are all symbols of a heart so unlike to those which the present fashion of the day has misled  Miss Dor  Why look so stedfastly on me Mr Mandred Do you pretend to see my heart  Sir Wil  Have you any  Miss Dor  Yes one large enough to holdeven my enemy  Enter  Servant  Ser  Mr Bronzely  Miss Dor  Shew him into the other room  Exit Servant  Come Lady Priory we must introduce you to Mr Bronzely he is one of the most fashionable agreeable pleasant whimsical unthinking and spirited creatures in all the world you'll be charmed  Lady Pri  I dare say it's near ten o'clock I am afraid I shan't be able to keep awake  Miss Dor  You mustWe are going to have a little concert'Twill be impossible to sleep  Exit  Miss Dorrillon  leading off  Lady Priory  Lady M  Upon my word my Lord your plan of management has made your wife unfit for company  Lord Pri  So much more sit to be a wife  Lady M  She is absolutely fatigued with hard labourfor shameHow does household drudgery become her hand  Lord Pri  Much better than cards and dice do yours  Exit Lady  Mary  followed by Lord  Priory  Sir  William  is left on the stage alone  Sir Wil  She "has a heart large enough to receive her enemy"And by that enemy she means her father  He sits down and shews marks of inquietude  Enter Sir  George Evelyn  Sir Geo  I beg your pardon Mr MandredI hope I don't interrupt youI only wished to speak to Miss Dorrillon  Sir Wil  She is just gone into the next room  Sir Geo  To the concert  Sir Wil  Are not you invited  Sir Geo  Yes but before I go in I wish to know who are the companyCan you tell whethera Mr Bronzeley is there  Sir Wil  I know he is  Sir Geo  Are you acquainted with him  Sir Wil  I have met him here frequently  Sir Geo  And are you  certain  he is here at present  Sir Wil  I have reason to be certain  Sir Geo  Any particular reason  Sir Wil  Your mistress when his name was announced went out to him exclaiming "he was the most charming and accomplished man in the world"  Sir Geo  greatly agitated  She loves him SirI have reason to believeto know she loves him Thus she gives up my happiness and her own to gratify the vanity of a man who has no real regard for her but whose predominant passion is to enjoy the villainous name of a general seducer  Sir Wil  rising  Why do you suffer it  Sir Geo  Hush Don't repeat what I have said or I lose her for ever I am at present under her resentment and have just sent into the next room to ask if she were there to speak with her  Enter Miss  Dorrillon  Miss Dor  And is it possible I was sent for by you  Sir Geo  Don't be offended that I should be uneasy and come to atone  Miss Dor  I can't forgive you Sir 'tis impossible  Going  Sir Geo  You pardon those Maria who offend you more  Sir Wil  But an ungrateful mind always prefers the unworthy  Miss Dor  Ah Mr Mandred are you there  playfully  And have you undertaken to be sir George's counsel If you have I believe he must lose his cause To sit you for the tender task of advocate in lovehave you ever been admitted an honourable member of that court Have you with all that solemn wisdom of which you are master  studied Ovid as our great lawyers study Blackstone If you haveshew causewhy plaintiff has a right to defendant's heart  Sir Wil  A man of fortune of family and of character ought at least be treated with respect and with honour  Miss Dor  You mean to say  That if  A  is beloved by  B  why should not  A  be constrained to return  B  's love  Counsellor for defendant  Because moreover and besides  B  who has a claim on defendant's heart there are also  C D E F  and  G  all of whom put in their separate claimsand what in this case can poor  A  do She is willing to part and divide her love share and share alike but  B  will have all or none so poor  A  must remain  A  by herself  A  Sir Geo  Do you think I would accept a share of your heart  Miss Dor  Do you think I could afford to give it you all "Besides" says defendant's counsellor  I will prove that plaintiff  B  has no heart to give defendant in returnhe has indeed a pulsation on the left side but as it never beat with any thing but suspicion and jealousy in the laws of love it is not termed admitted or considered a heart  Going  Sir Geo  Where are you going  Miss Dor  To the musicroom to be sure and if you follow me it shall be to see me treat every person there better than yourselfand Mr Bronzely whom you hate to see me treat him best of all  Exit  Sir Geo  I must follow you though to death  Exit  Sir Wil  Fool And yet am I nearly as weak as he is Else why do I linger in this house Why feed my hopes with some propitious moment to waken her to repentance Why still anxiously wish to ward off some dreaded fateIf we would marry Sir George nowif she would give me only  one  proof of discretion I think I would endeavour to take her to my heart  Enter Mr  Bronzely  in great haste  Bron  My dear Sir will you do me the greatest favour in the worldyou must do it in an instant too Do my dear Sir ask no question but lend me your coat for a single moment and take mineonly for a momentI cannot explain my reasons now my impatience is so greatbut the instant you have complied I will inform you of the whole secret and you will for ever rejoice that you granted my request  Pulling off his coat  Sir Wil  aside with great scorn  And this very contemptible fellow is the favoured lover of my daughterI'll  after a struggle  yesI'll make myself master of his secretit may possibly concern hermy childmy child's safety may depend upon it  Bron  Dear Mr Mandred no time is to be lost  Sir Wil  This is rather a strange request Mr Bronzely However your fervency convinces me you must have some very forcible reasonThere's my coat Sir  Gives it him  Bron  Thank you dear Sira thousand timesThis goodness I shall ever rememberthis binds me to you for ever  putting it on  Thank you Sir a thousand times  Bowing dressed and composed  Sir Wil  after putting on the other coat  And now Sir explain the cause of this metamorphosislet me have the satisfaction to know what advantage will accrue from it and in what I have to rejoice  Bron  Will you promise me not to reveal the secret if I trust you with it  Sir Wil  Would you add conditions after the bargain is made I must know your secret instantly  Threatening  Bron  Then I will disclose it to you voluntarily and rely on your honour to keep it  Sir Wil  attentively  Well Sir  Bron  Hark I thought I heard somebody coming  Offers to go  Sir Wil  I insist upon the information  Laying hold of him  Bron  Well then Sirwellyou shallyou shallThen Sirin the small gallery which separates the musicroom from the rest of these apartmentsin that little gallery the lamp is just unfortunately gone outI was as unfortunately coming along when the whisking of a woman's gown made me give a sudden startI found a person was in the gallery with me and in the dark  Sir Wil  Well Sir  Bron  And so confidently assuring myself that it was Miss Dorrillon's waitingmaid or Lady Mary's waitingmaid I most unluckily clasped my arms around her and took one kiss  Sir Wil  Only one  Bron  Th  re might be half a dozen I w  n't  end to swear  dozen before I knew who she was My rapidity would not let her breathe at first and she was fairly speechlessBut the moment she recovered her breath she cry'd "Villian whoever you are you shall repent this"I found it was the voice of a lady to whom I had just been introduced in the concertroom▪ one Lady Priory It seems she  to bed at the tune we unhappily met  Sir Wil  But what has this to do with your coat  Bron  A great deal Siryou will find a great dealAs I perceived she did not know me I carefully held my tonguebut she with her prudish notions called "Help and murder" On which I flew to the door to get away before the lights could be broughtshe slew after me and as I went out exclaimed  Don't hope to conceal yourself I shall know you among the whole concertroom for I carry scissors hanging at my side and I have cut a piece off your coat  Sir  William  looks hastily at his coalon which  Bronzely  holds up the part cut  And sure enough so she had  Sir Wil  in anger  And what Sir am I to have the disgrace  Bron  Either you or I must  Sir Wil  And do you dare  Bron  Consider my dear Sir how much less the fault is if perpetrated by you than by me This is the first offence of the kind which I dare say you have committed this many a year and it will be overlooked in  you  But I have been suspected of two or three things of the same sort within a very short time and I should never be forgiven  Sir Wil  Nor ought you to be forgivenIt would be scandalous in me to connive  Bron  But would it not be more scandalous to reveal the secret of a person who confided in youwho flew to you in distress as his friend the partner of his cares  Sir Wil  Your impertinence to me but more your offence to a woman of virtue deserves punishment Yet I think the punishment of death in the way that a man of my Lord Priory's temper might inflict it much too honourable for you deserts so I save your life for some less creditable end I lend you my coat to disgrace you by existence and will go to my chamber and put on another myself  Passes  Bronzely  in order to retire to his chamber  Enter Lord  Priory  meeting him Sir  William  starts  Bron  going up to Lord  Priory  Ah my Lord is the concert over charming music that  solo  was divine  Sir  William  steals to a chair and sits down to hide his coat  Lord  Priory  after looking inquisitively at  Bronzely's  dress  It is time the concert should be overit had been better it had never begun for there have been very improper persons admitted  In great anger  Bron  affecting surprise  Indeed  Lord Pri  trembling with rage  I am at a loss how to act  Draws a chair with violence and places himself down by Sir  William  Sir  William  appears disconcerted and uneasy  But if I could find the man to whom this piece of cloth belongs  Bron  What this small piece of woollen cloth  Lord Pri  Yes then I should know how to act In the mean time Mr Mandred as I know you are a great admirer of my wife  Sir William  starts  and a grave prudent man of honour I come to ask your advice how I am the most likely to find out the villain who has dared to insult her for a gross insult she has received from one of Mr Norberry's visitor's wearing a coat of which this is a part  Bron  The villain no doubt stole out of the house immediately  Lord Pri  I ordered the street door to be guarded that instantand you Mr Bronzely are now the last man whose habit I have examined  Bron  And you see I am perfectly whole  Turning round  Lord Pri  I do seeI do see  Sir  William  moves about on his chair and appears greatly embarrassed Lord  Priory  starts up in a violent passionSir  William  starts up with him  Lord Pri  I'll find him out if he is on earthI'll find him out ifMy passion carries me awayI have not coolness to detect him myselfI'll employ anotherI'll send Oliver in search Oliver  calling  Oliver here Oliver Why don't you answer when you are called you stupid dull idle forgetful blundering obstinate careless selfsufficient  Exit in a fury  Sir Wil  rising with great dignity  And now Mr Bronzely how do you think you are to repay me for having felt one transitory moment of shame Understand Sir that shame is one of the misfortunes to which I have never  Enter Lady  Mary  Bron  aside to Sir  William  Sit down sit down sit downhold your tongue and sit down  Sir  William  reluctantly retires to his chair  Lady M  Well I do most cordially rejoice when peevish suspicious and censorious people meet with humiliation I could die with laughing at the  incident which has put both my Lord and my Lady Priory in the greatest terror grief and rage  Sir Wil  rising  I am out of all patience The malicious depravity of persons in a certain sphere of life is not to be borne  With firmness and solemnity  Lady MaryMr Bronzely  Bron  in a half whisper to him  Go awaydon't expose yourselfsteal out the roomtake my advice and go tobedhide yourself So great is my respect for you I would not have you detected for the world  Sir Wil  I am going to retire Sir I would not throw my friend's house into confusion and broils therefore I am as well pleased not to be detected as you can be  Goes to the door then turns  But before I quit the room I am irresistibly impelled to sayMr Bronzely Lady Mary while you continue to ridicule all that is virtuous estimable dignified your vices most assuredly will plunge you into that very disgrace  Enter  Oliver  and places the piece of cloth against Sir  William  's coat  Oli  'Tis as exact a match as ever wasit fits to a thread Ha ha haHa ha ha  Sir Wil  Rascal  Bron  Did not I entreat you to go to bed  Lady M  Oh this is the highest gratification I ever knew My Lord my Lord  calling  Bron  Hush hushhold for heavens sake  Oli  But mercy and goodness defend us who would have thought of this grave gentleman Ha ha haI can tell you what Sir my Lord will be in a terrible passion with you This house won't hold you both and I am sure I hate to make mischiefMumI'll say nothing about it  clapping  Sir William  on the shoulder  And so make yourself easy  Bron  on the other side of  Sir William  Yes make yourself easy  Oli  A good servant should sometimes be a peacemakerfor my part I have faults of my own  and so I dare say has that gentlewoman But of ail the birds in the wood how came you to make up to my Lady Ha ha ha ha ha  Bron  No jestsno jests Mr Mandred is my friendmy very good friendand he is not so much to blame as you think forGood night my dear Sir Heaven bless you I thank you a thousand times Good night  Shaking hands with  Sir William  and leading him towards the door  Sir Wil  with steady composure  Good nightGood night Lady Mary  Exit  Oli  Why he never so much as once said he was obliged to me  Lady M  I am sure if you do not discover this to your master I will  Oli  Oh as that old gentleman had not manner to say "thank you for your kindness" I'll go tell my Lord directly  Exit  Bron  running after him  No no nostop Oliver He is gone  Lady M  What makes you thus anxious and concerned Bronzely Now I wish I may suffer death if till I came into this room I did not think  you  were the offender  Bron  I I indeedNo if I could have been tempted to offend any woman in this house in a similar manner it could have been none but you  Bowing  Lady M  No Bronzely no I have been too partial to you to have any remaining claimsHark don't I hear Lord Priory's voice in a dreadful rage  Bron  Then Oliver has accused him What shall I do to prevent mischief Dear Lady Mary as it is not proper for me to stay here any longer uninvited do you run and try to pacify my Lord Priory Tell him Mandred does not sleep here tonight and in the morning you are sure he will make an apology  Lady M  I will do as you desirebut I know Mr Mandred so well that I am sure he will not  Exit  Bron  Then I will for him Early in the morning I'll wait on Lady Priory and beg pardon in his name without his knowing it Yes I have got poor Mandred into a difficulty and it is my duty to get him out of it And then I shall not only serve him but have one interview more with that heavenly woman  Exit  ACT III  SCENE I  An Apartment at Mr  NORBERRY's  Enter  Mr Bronzely  followed by a Servant  BRONZELY  Looking at his watch  I AM early I know but Lady Priory is the only person I wish to see Is my Lord with her  Ser  No Sir Lord Priory sat up very late and is in bed yet  Bron  Acquaint Lady Priory a person comes on urgent business begs to speak with her If she asks my name you know it  Exit Servant  Pray heaven she may bless me with her sight Never was so enchanted by a woman in my life and never was played such a trick in my life I am half inflamed by love and half by spite once more to attempt her  Enter  Lady Priory  he bows most respectfullyshe curtsies  Bron  Lady Priory I am comeI am come upon rather an aukward yet a very serious business it was my misfortune to be among that company yesterday evening where an unworthy member of it had the insolence to offer an affront to your resplendent virtue  Lady Pri  I have some household accounts to arrange and breakfast to make for my Lord as soon as he leaves his chamber therefore if you please Sir proceed to the business on which you came without thinking it necessary to interrupt it by any compliment to me  Bron  I will be concise MadamIn a word I wait upon you from Mr Mandred with the most humble apology for his late conduct which he acknowledges to have been indecorous and unwarrantable but he trusts that in consequence of the concession which I now make for him the whole matter will from this hour be buried in oblivion  Lady Pri  going to the side of the scene and speaking  If my Lord is at leisure tell him there is a gentleman would be glad to speak with him  to  Bronzely  I am sorry Sir you should know so little of the rules of our family as to suppose that I could give an answer upon any subject in which my husband condescends to be concerned  Going  Bron  Lady Priory stop You can at least use your power to soften Lord Priory's resentment and unless this apology is accepted a challenge must follow and possibly he may fall  Lady Pri  Possibly  Sighing  Bron  You are interested for your husband's life  Lady Pri  Certainly But I set equal value on his reputation  Going  Bron  Hear me one sentence moreI cannot part from her  Aside  Oh I have something of such importance to communicate to youand yetI know not how  Lady Pri  Then tell it to my husband  Bron  Hem hem  Aside  Oh Lady Priory if the insult of last night has given you offence should you not wish to be informed of a plan laid for yet greater violence  She starts  Lady Pri  Good heaven  Bron  This is neither time nor place to disclose what I wish to saynor do I know how to find an opportunity to speak with you alone free from the possibility of intrusion where I could reveal a  secret  to you which is connected with your happiness with your future peace  Lady Pri  You alarm me beyond expression I am going to my own house about twelve o'clock for a couple of hoursfollow me there  Bron  And I shall be admitted  Lady Pri  Certainlyfor you have excited my curiosity and I am all impatience to hear what you have to communicate that so much concerns me  Bron  Promise then no person but yourself shall ever know of it  She hesitates  Unless you promise this I dare not trust you  Lady Pri  after a second hesitation  I do promise I promise faithfully  Bron  Your word is sacred I rely  Lady Pri  Most sacred  Bron  And you promise that no one but yourself shall know of the appointment we have made now at your house nor of the secret which I will then disclose to you  Lady Pri  I promise faithfully that no one but myself shall ever know of either  Bron  Remember then to be there alone exactly  Lady Pri  At one o'clock  Bron  And that your servants have orders to shew me to you  Lady Pri  I am too much interested to forget one circumstance  Bron  Go now then to Lord Priory with Mr Mandred's apologyand urge his acceptance of it with all that persuasion by which you are formed to govern while you appear to obey  Lady Pri  I will present the apology as I received it from you but do not imagine I dare give my opinion upon it unless I am desired  Bron  But if you  are  desired you will then say  Lady Pri  Exactly what I think  Exit  Bron  I'll do a meritorious act this very day This poor woman lives in slavery with her husband I'll give her an opportunity to run away from him When we meet I'll have a postchaise waiting a few doors from her house boldly tell her that I  love her and  Enter Miss  Dorrillon  My dear Miss Dorrillon I could not sleep all night but am come thus early on purpose to complain of your treatment of me during the whole of yesterday evening Not one look did you glance towards meand there I sat in miserable solitude up in one corner the whole time of the concert  Miss Dor  I protest I did not see youand stranger still never thought of you  Bron  You then like another better than you do me  Miss Dor  I do  Bron  Do you tell him so  Miss Dor  No  Bron  You tell him you like me the best  Miss Dor  Yes  Bron  Then I will believe what you say to him not what you say to meAnd though you charge me with inconstancy yet I swear to you my beloved Maria  taking her hand  that no woman no woman but yourself  Enter Sir  William  and starts at seeing his Daughter in such close conversation with  Bronzely  Sir Wil  aside  How familiarmy eyes could not be shocked with a sight half so wounding to my heart as this  Bron  apart to Miss  Dorrillon  Hush you have heard the story but don't laugh at him now He is in a devilish ill humour and it will all fall on me Go awayIt's a very good story but laugh at him another time  Miss Dor  I don't believe a word of the story yet as a received opinion it is a charming weapon for an enemy and I long to use it  Bron  Not now not nowbecause I have some business with him and 'twill put him out of temper  He hands her to the door  Exit Miss  Dorrillon  Sir Wil  looking stedfastly after her  Poor girl poor girl I am not yet sufficiently enraged against her not to compassionate her for her choiceIs  this the man who is to be for life her companion her protector  Bron  Well Mr Mandred I believe I have settled it  Sir Wil  Settled what  anxiously  Bron  At least I have done all in my power to serve you perhaps you don't know that Mr Oliver divulged the whole affair But I have waited on my Lady Priory and I do believe I have settled it with her to manage it so with my Lord that every thing shall be hushed up You may expect a few jests among your female acquaintance and a few epigrams in the newspapers but I verily believe every thing material is safeIs there any farther satisfaction which you demand from me  Sir Wil  Not at presenta man is easily satisfied who possesses both courage and strength to do himself right whenever he feels his wrongs oppressive I have as yet found but little inconvenience from the liberties you have taken with me and what just at this time far more engages my attention than revenge is an application to you for intelligence Without farther preface do you pay your addresses to the young lady who lives in this house  Bron  Yes I do SirI do  Sir Wil  You know I suppose which of the two ladies I mean  Bron  Which ever you mean Sir 'tis all the same for I pay my addresses to them both  Sir W  starting  To them both  Bron  I always do  Sir Wil  And pray which of them do you love  Bron  Both Sirupon my word bothI assure you both  Sir Wil  But you don't intend to marry both  Bron  I don't intend to marry either and indeed the woman whom I love best in the world has a husband already Do you suppose I could confine my affections to Lady Mary or Miss Dorrillon after Lady Priory appeared do you suppose I did not know who it was I met last night in the dark wherever I visit Mr Mandred I always make love  to every woman in the house and I assure you they all expect itI assure you Sir they all expect it  Sir  William  walks about in anger  Bron  Have you any further commands for me  Sir Wil  Yes one word moreAnd you really have no regard for this girl who parted from you as I came in  Bron  Oh yes pardon meI admire I adore I love her to distraction and if I had not been so long acquainted with my Lady Mary nor had seen my Lady Priory last night I should certainly call Sir George Evelyn to an account for being so perpetually with her  Sir Wil  anxiously  Do you think he loves her  Bron  Yes I dare say as well as I do  Sir Wil  Do you think she likes him  Bron  I think she likes  me  Sir Wil  But with your method of affection she may like him too  Bron  She may she mayIn short there is no answering for what  she  likesall whim and flightinessacquainted with every bodycoquetting with every bodyand in debt with every body Her mind distracted between the claims of lovers and the claims of creditorsthe anger of Mr Norberry and the want of intelligence from he father  Sir Wil  She is in a hopeful way  Bron  Oh it would be impossible to think of marrying her in her present statefor my part I can'tand I question whether Sir George wouldBut if her father comes home and gives her the fortune that was once expected why then I may possibly marry her myself  Sir Wil  firmly  She will never have any fortuneI come from India lately you know and you may take my word her father is not coming over nor will he ever come  Bron  Are you sure of that  Sir Wil  Very sure  Bron  Then keep it a secretdon't tell her so  poor thing it would break her heart She is doatingly fond of her father  Sir Wil  Hah howoh no she can have no remembrance of him  Bron  Not of his person perhaps but he has constantly corresponded with her sent her presents and affectionate lettersand you know a woman's heart is easily impressed  Sir Wil  I never heard her mention her father  Bron  Not to youbut to us who are kind to her she talks of him continually She cried bitterly the other day when the last ship came in and there was no account of him  Sir Wil  Did she did she  eagerly  Aye I suppose she is alarmed lest he should be dead and all his fortune lost  Bron  No I believe her affection for  him  is totally unconnected with any interested views I have watched her upon that head and I believe she loves her father sincerely  Sir Wil  wiping a tear from his eye  I believe it does not matter whom she loves  Bron  By the bye she hates  you  Sir Wil  I thought so  Bron  Yes you may be satisfied of that Yes she even quarrelled with me the other day for speaking in your favour you had put her in a passion and she said  no one that loved her ought to have any respect for you  Sir Wil  I am much obliged to hervery much obliged to her Did she say nothing more  Bron  Only  that you were illnatured dogmatic cruel and insolent  Nothing moreAnd say what she will against you you know you can be even with her  Sir Wil  Yes I  can  be even with her and I  will  be even with her  Enter Lord  Priory  and takes  Bronzely  on one side  Lord Pri  I have accepted this man's apologyI will not call him to a serious account but he shall not escape every kind of resentmentI am resolved  to laugh at him to turn the whole affair into mirth and good humour at the same time to gall him to the heart Good morning Mr MandredLet me go  violently to  Bronzely  I must joke with him  Bron  But neither your voice nor your looks agree with your words  Lord Pri  Mr Mandred I did intend to be angrybut it would give too respectable an air to a base act onand so I am come to laugh at you  Enter  Lady Mary  And I am sure Lady Mary will join even me in laughing at this man of gallantry  Lady M  Oh I am absolutely afraid to come near the Tarquin  Sir Wil  You need  not  Lady Mary for there can be no Tarquin without a Lucretia  Lord Pri  However Mr Mandred it is proper I should tell you I accept the apology you have made but at the same time  Sir Wil  hastily  What do you mean my Lord I have made no apology  Bron  Yes yes you haveI called and made one for you  Sir Wil  Made an apology for me You have just gone one step too far then I insist  Bron  Drawing Sir  William  on one side  I willI willI will set every thing to rights It would be base in me if I did not and I will  Turns to Lord  Priory  and Lady  Mary  Yes Mr Mandred I will retrieve  your  character at the expence of my  own  I am more able to contend with the frenzy of a jealous husband than you are  Enter Miss  Dorrillon  and Sir  George Evelyn  I am happy to see youyou are just come in time to hear me clear the grave the respectable character of my friend Mr Mandred and to stigmatise my ownMy Lord vent all your anger and your satire upon me It was I pray believe me I beg you will don't doubt my word it was I who committed the offence of which my friend the man I  respect and reverence stands accusedIt was I who offended my Lady Priory and then  Lord Pri  It can't beI won't believe you  Lady M  But how generous and noble in him to take it upon himself  Bron  to Sir  William  There what can I do more You see they won't believe meTell me what I can do more Can I do any thing moreMy feelings are wounded on your account more than on my own and compel me though reluctantly to quit the room  Exit  Sir Geo  I am at a loss which to admire most the warmth of Mr Bronzely's friendship or the coldness of Mr Mandred's gratitude  Lady M  Oh if it were not for that happy steadiness of feature he could not preach rectitude of conduct as he does  Lord Pri  going up to Sir  William  Eloquent admonisher of youth  Miss Dor  going to him  Indeed my rigid monitor I cannot but express admiration that under those austere looks and that sullen brow there still should lurk  Sir Wil  Have a caredon't proceedstop where you aredare not  you  complete a sentence that is meant to mock meI have borne the impertinence of this whole company with patience with contempt but dare  you  to breathe an accent suspicious of my conduct and I will instantly teach you how to respect  me  and to shrink with horror from yourself  She stands motionless in surprise  Lord Pri  What a passion he is in Compose yourself Mr Mandred  Miss Dor  I protest Mr Mandred  Sir Wil  Raising his voice  Dare not to address yourself to me  Lady M  Did you ever hear the likeAnd I vow she looks awed by him  Lord Pri  How strange that a man can't command his temper  Sir Geo  Mr Mandred permit me to say I have ever wished to treat you with respectnor would  I be rash in laying that wish asideYet I must now take upon me to assure you that if you think to offend every lady in this house with impunity you are mistaken  Sir Wil  Sir George if you mean to frighten me by your threats I laugh at youbut if your warmth is really kindled and by an attachment to that unworthy object  pointing to Miss  Dorrillon  I only pity you  Sir Geo  Insufferable  going up to him  Instantly make an atonement for what you have said or expect the consequence  Sir Wil  And pray Sir George what atonement does your justice demand  Sir Geo  Retract your wordsAcknowledge you were grossly deceived when you said Miss Dorrillon was unworthy  Sir Wil  Retract my words  Sir Geo  Were they not unjustIs it a reproach that enveloped in the maze of fashionable life she has yet preserved her virtue unsuspected That encumbered with the expences consequent to her connections she has proudly disdained even from me the honourable offer of pecuniary aid that her fond hope still fixes on the return of an absent parent whose blessing she impatiently expects and that I should have watched her whole conduct with an eye of scrutinizing jealousy and yet have only beheld that which makes me aspire as the summit of earthly happiness to become her husband  Sir Wil  Young man I admire your warmth  with great fervour and affection  There is much compassion and benevolence and charity in sometimes mistaking the vicious for the virtuous and if in the heat of contention I have said a word reflecting on your character I am ready to avow my error and before this company to beg your pardon  Sir Geo  That is not enough Sir  taking  Miss Dorrillon  by the hand and leading her forward  you must ask this lady's pardon  Sir  William  starts and turns his face away strongly impressed  Sir Wil  Ask  her  pardon Though I forgive some insults I will not thisAsk  her  pardon  Miss Dor  Nay nay Sir George you have no business with Mr Mandred's quarrels and mineReserve your heroic courage for some nobler purpose than a poor woman's reputation  Sir Geo  Point out a nobler and I'll give up this  Lady M  There is none so noble And I wish Sir George you would undertake to vindicate mine  Lord Pri  Come Lady Mary let us retire and leave these two irritable men to themselves  Lady M  Come Maria let us leave them alone He'll teach Mr Mandred to be civil for the future  Miss Dor  in great agitation  Dear madam I would not leave them alone for the world  Lady M  Then my Lord you and I will they have no offensive weapons so we may venture to leave them  Lord Pri  This comes of being too warm in conversation This comes of being in a passion  Exeunt Lord  Priory  and Lady Mary  Sir Geo  While there is a female present I have only to saygood morning Mr Mandred  Going  Miss Dor  catching hold of him  For once I give up my pride to soften yours Come do not look thus determinedI am sure Mr Mandred did not mean to offend me the words he made use of fell from his lips by accident  Sir Wil  They did notI meant themI mean them stilland I repeat them  Miss Dor  to  Sir William  Now how can you be so provokingNay hold Sir George  he offers to go  you shall not go away with that frowning brow  She draws him gently towards Sir  William  then takes Sir  William  's hand  Nor you with yoursCome shake hands for my sakeNow as I live Sir George Mr Mandred's hand feels warmer and kinder than yourshe tries to draw it back but he has not the heart  Sir  William  snatches it away as by compulsion  Thou art a strange personagethou wilt not suffer me either to praise or dispraise theeCome Sir George  make up this differencefor if you were to fight and Mr Mandred was to fall  Sir Wil  What then  Miss Dor  Why "I could better spare a better man"  Sir Wil  How  Miss Dor  I see you are both sullen both obstinate and I have but one resourceSir George if you aspire to my hand dare not to lift your's against Mr Mandred He and I profess to be enemies but if I may judge of his feelings by my own we have but passing enmitiesI bear him no malice nor he me I dare be sworn Therefore Sir lift but your arm against him or insult him with another word and our intercourse is for ever at an end  Exit  Sir George  and  Sir William  stand for some time silent  Sir Geo  Why is it in the power of one woman to make two men look ridiculously  Sir Wil  I am at a loss to know Sir whether you and I part friends or enemiesHowever call on me in the way you best like and you will find me ready to meet you either as an enemy or as a friend  Exeunt separately  ACT IV  SCENE I  A Hall in Lord Priory's  Two Servants discovered sittingAnother enters  First  SERVANT  DO you hear Mr Porter you are to admit no person but Mr Bronzely    d Ser  Mr Bronzelyvery well  a loud rapping  and there I suppose he is    st Ser  looking through the window  Yes that I believe is his carriage  To third Ser  Let my Lady know  Exit third Sir  Enter  Bronzely  Bron  You are sure Lady Priory is at home    st Ser  Yes Sir and gave orders to admit nobody but you  Bron  Has she been some time at home    st Ser  Yes Sir I dare say my Lady came from Mr Norberry's half an hour ago  Bron  Waiting for me half an hour  aside  Shew me to her instantly  Exit following the servant hastily  SCENE II  An Apartment at Lord Priory's  Enter  Bronzely  and  Lady Priory  on opposite sides  Bron  My dear Lady Priory how kind you are not to have forgotten your promise  Lady Pri  How was it possible I should I have been so anxious for the intelligence you have to communicate that it was pain to wait till the time arrived  Bron  Thus invited encouraged to speak I will speak boldlyand I call heaven to witness that what I am going to say  Lady Pri  No stay a moment longerdon't tell me just yet  listening towards the side of the scenes  for I wish him to hear the very beginning  Bron  Who hear the very beginning  Enter  Lord PrioryBronzely  starts  Lord Pri  I have not kept you waiting I hope My Lawyer stopt me on business or I should have been here soonerMy dear Mr Bronzely  going up to him  I thank you a thousand times for the interest you take in my concerns and I come prepared with proper coolness and composure to hear the secret with which you are going to entrust us  Bron  The secretyes SirThe secret which I was going to disclose to my Lady Priory  Ha Ha haBut my Lord I am afraid it is of too frivolous a nature for your attention  Lord Pri  I account nothing frivolous which concerns my wife  Bron  Certainly my Lord certainly not  Lord Pri  Besides she told me it was of the utmost importance Did not you  angrily  Lady Pri  He said so  Bron  And so it wasit was of importance  then  just at the very time I was speaking to Lady Priory on the subject  Lady Pri  You said so but this very moment  Lord Pri  Come come tell it immediately whatever it is Come let us hear it  after waiting some time  Why Sir you look as if you were ashamed of it What can be the meaning of this  Bron  To be plain my Lord my secret will disclose the folly of a person for whom I have a sincere regard  Lord Pri  No matterlet every fool look like a fool and every villain be known for what he isTell your story  Lady Pri  How can you deprive me of the pleasure you promised You said it would prevent every future care  Lord Pri  Explain Sir I begin to feel myself not quite so composed as I expected You never perhaps saw me in a passionshe hasand if you were once to see me really angry  Bron  Then my Lord I am apt to be passionate tooand I boldly tell you that what I had to reveal though perfectly proper was meant for Lady Priory alone to hear I entreated your Ladyship not to mention to my Lord that I had any thing to communicate and you gave me a solemn promise you would  not  Lady Pri  Upon my honour during our whole conversation upon that subject you never named my Lord Priory's name  Bron  I charged you to keep what I had to tell you a profound secret  Lady Pri  Yes but I thought you understood could have no secrets from my husband  Bron  You promised no one should know it but yourself  Lady Pri  He is  myself  Lord Pri  How Mr Bronzely did you suppose she and I were two Perhaps you did and that we wanted a third Well I quite forgive you for your silly mistake and laugh at you ha ha ha as I did at Mandred  seriously  Did you suppose Sir we lived like persons of fashion of the modern time Did you imagine that a woman of her character could have a wish a desire even a thought a secret from her husband  Bron  It is amazing to find so much fidelity the reward of tyranny  Lady Pri  SirI speak with humilityI would not wish to give offence  timidly  But to the best of my observation and understanding your sex in respect to us are  all tyrants  I was born to be the slave of some of youI make the choice to obey my husband  Lord Pri  Yes Mr Bronzely and I believe it is more for her happiness to be my slave than your friendto live in fear of me than in love with youLady Priory leave the room  Exit  Lady Priory  Lord Pri  Do you seeDid you observe the glow of truth and candour which testifies that woman's faith and do you not blush at having attempted it Call me a tyrant Where are the signs Oh if every married man would follow my system in the management of his wife every impertinent lover would look just as foolish as you  Bron  This is all boasting my Lordyou live in continual fearfor without meaning any offence to Lady Priory's honour you know you dare not trust her for one hour alone with any man under sixty  Lord Pri  I dare trust her at any time with a coxcomb  Bron  That is declaring I am not onefor I am certain you dare not trust her alone with me  Lord Pri  in a passion  Yes with fifty such  Bron  But not with oneyou are rightit might be dangerous  Lord Pri  angrily  No it would not  Bron  significantly  Yes it would  Lord Pri  Have not you had a trial  Bron  But you were present You constantly follow all her steps watch all she says and does But I believe you are rightwives are not to be trusted  Lord Pri  Mine is  Bron  No my dear Lord Priory you must first become gentle before you can positively confide in her affectionbefore you can trust her in a house or in any place alone  Lord Pri  hastily  To prove you are mistaken I'll instantly go back to my friend Norberry's and leave you here to tell her the secret you boasted Pay your addresses to her if that is the secretYou have my free consent  Bron  My dear friend I'll accept it  Lord Pri  Ay I see you have hopes of supplanting me by calling me your friendBut can you conceive now that she'll Men to you  Bron  You have given me leave to try and can't recall it  Lord Pri  But depend upon it you will meet with some terrible humiliation  Bron  Either you or I shall  Lord Pri  I shall laugh to hear you tumbled down stairs  Bron  You are not to remain on the watch here you are to return to Mr Norberry's  Lord Pri  Was that the bargain  Bron  Don't you remember you said so  Lord Pri  Well if that will give you any satisfaction  Bron  It will give me great satisfaction  Lord Pri

it is with his permission I am come to conclude the conversation which was just now interruptedIs not that right my Lord Are not those words exactly corresponding with your kind promise  Lord Pri  I believe they are  Oli  I am "to take Mr Bronzely to my lady and tell her you sent him"  Exit  Oliver  Bron  Now this is a perfect fashion and while I step to Lady Priory do you go and comfort my intended wife Lady Mary  Lord Pri  I hate the fashionand were I not sure you would now be received in a very unfashionable manner  Bron  No rough dealings I hope  Lord Pri  Oh you begin to be afraid do you  Bron  Nobut I have met with an accident or two latelyand I am not so well acquainted with ancient usages as to know in what manner a man of my pursuits would have been treated in former times  Lord Pri  A man of your pursuits Mr Bronzely is of a very late date and to be shamed out of them by a wife like mine  Bron  Then we shall all be three oldfashioned  Exit following  Oliver  Lord Pri  returning and looking anxiously after  Bronzely  I am passionateI am precipitateI have no command over my temperHowever if a man cannot govern himself yet he will never make any very despicable figure as long as he knows how to govern his wife  Exit  SCENE III  Sir  William  's Apartment at Mr  Norberry  'sSeveral trunks and travelling boxesSir  William  discovered packing writings into a portfolio  Sir Wil  And here is the end of my voyage to Englanda voyage which for years my mind has dwelt on with delightI pictured to myself my daughter grown to womanhood beautiful and so she isAccomplished and so she isVirtuous and so she isAm I of a discontented nature then that I am not satisfiedAm I too nicePerhaps I amSoothing thoughtI will for a moment cherish it and dwell with some little gratitude upon her late anxiety for my safety  He walks about in a thoughtful musing manner  A loud thrusting and rapping is heard at his chamber door  Enter Miss  Dorrillon  hastily and in affright  Miss Dor  Oh Mr Mandred I beg your pardonI did not know this was your apartment But suffer me to lock the door  she locks it  and conceal me for a moment for heaven's sake  Sir Wil  What's the matter Why have you locked my door  Miss Dor  trembling  I dare not tell you  Sir Wil  I insist upon knowing  Miss Dor  Why thenI am pursued by aI cannot name the horrid name  Nab  Without  She went into this room  Miss Dor  to  Sir William  Go to the door and say I did not  Sir Wil  How  Nab  without  Please to open the door  Miss Dor  Threaten to beat him if he won't go away  Sir Wil  Give me the key and let me see from whom you want to hide  commandingly  Give me the key  Miss Dor  collecting firmness  I will not  Sir Wil  starting  "Will not""Will not" when I desire you  Miss Dor  Nosince you refuse me protection I'll protect myself  Sir Wil  But you had better not have made use of that expression to meyou had better not Recall it by giving me the key  Miss Dor  If I do will you let me conceal myself behind that bookcase and say I am not here  Sir Wil  Utter a falsehood  Miss Dor  I would for you  A hammering at the door  Sir Wil  They are breaking open the doorGive me the key I

merciless creditorsI shall be dragged to a prison Do not deliver me upI am unfortunateI am overwhelmed with misfortunehave compassion on me  She falls on her knees  Sir Wil  in great agitation  Don't  kneel  to meI don't mean you to kneel to meWhat makes you think of kneeling to  me  I must do my duty  He unlocks the door  Enter  Nabson  Miss  Dorrillon  steal behind the bookcase  Sir Wil  What did you want Sir  Nab  A lady that I have just this minute made my prisoner but she ran from me and locked herself in here  Sir Wil  with surprise  Arrested a lady  Nab  Yes Sir and if you mean to deny her being here I must make bold to search the room  Sir Wil  Let me look at your credentials  takes the writ  "Elizabeth Dorrillon for six hundred pounds" Pray Sir is it customary to have female names on pieces of paper of this denomination  Nab  Oh yes Sir very customary There are as many ladies who will run into tradesmen's books as there are gentlemen and when one goes to take the ladies they are a thousand times more slippery to catch than the men  Sir Wil  AbominableWell Sir your present prisoner shall not slip through your hands if I can prevent it I scorn to defend a worthless woman as much as I should glory in preserving a good one and I give myself joy in being the instrument of your executing justice  He goes and leads Miss  Dorrillon  from the place where she was concealedshe casts down her head  What do you droop Do you tremble You who at the ball tonight would have danced lightly though your poor creditor had been perishing with want You who never asked yourself if your extravagance might not send an industrious father of a family to prison can you feel on the prospect of going thither yourself  Miss Dor  For what cause am I the object of your perpetual persecution  Nab  Lor Madam the gentleman means to bail you after all I can see it by his looks  Sir Wil  How rascal dare you suppose of imagine or hint such a thing  going up to him in anger  Miss Dor  That's right beat him out of the house  Sir Wil  No Madam he shall not go out of the house without taking you along with him Punishment may effect in your disposition what indulgence has no hope of producingThere is your prisoner  handing her over to him  and you may take my word that she will not be released by me or by any  one and it will be only adding to a debt she can never pay to take her to any place previous to a prison  with emotion of resentment yet deep sorrow  Nab  Is that true my Lady  Miss Dor  after a pause  Very true I have but one friendbut one relation in the worldand he is far away  weeps  Sir  William  wipes his eyes  Nab  More's the pity  Sir Wil  No Sir nono pity at allfor if fewer fine ladies had friends we should have fewer examples of profligacy  She walks to the door then turns to Sir  William  Miss Dor  I forgive you  Exit with  Nabson  Sir Wil  looking after her  And perhaps I  could  forgive you But I must not No this is justicethis is doing my dutythis is strength of mindthis is fortitudefortitude  He walks proudly then throws his head into his handkerchief going off  Enter  Lady Mary  a man following  Lady M  Mr Mandred Mr Mandred  He turns  SirMr MandredSir  in a supplicating tone  I presumeI presume Sir  Sir Wil  What Madam what  Lady M  I came to request a favour of you  Sir Wil  So it should seem by that novel deportment  Lady M  If you would for once consider with lenity the frailty incidental to a woman who lives in the gay world  Sir Wil  Well Madam  Lady M  How much she is led away by the temptation of fine cloaths fine coaches and fine things  Sir Wil  Come to the business  Lady M  You are rich we all know though you endeavour to disguise the truth  Sir Wil  I can't stay to hear you if you don't proceed  Lady M  My request issave from the dreadful horrors of a jail a woman who has no friend near her  a woman who may have inadvertently offended you but who never  Sir Wil  'Tis in vain for you to plead on her accountshe knows my sentiments upon her conductshe knows the opinion I have formed of her and you cannot prevail on me to change it  Lady M  Do you suppose I come to plead for Miss Dorrillon  Sir Wil  Certainly  Lady M  No I am pleading for myself I am unfortunately involved in similar circumstancesI have a similar debt to the selfsame tradesman and we are both at present in the selfsame predicament  Sir Wil  And upon what pretence did you suppose I would be indulgent to you move than to her  Lady M  Because you have always treated me with less severity and because I overheard you just now say you  should glory in delivering from difficulty a good woman  Sir Wil  And so I should  Lady M  How unlike the world  Sir Wil  No whatever the discontented may please to say the world is affectionate is generous to the good more especially to the good of the female sex for it is only an exception to a general rule when a good woman is in pecuniary distress  Exit Sir  William  Enter Lord  Priory  humming a tune but with a very serious face he pulls out his watch with evident marks of anxietycoughsrubs his foreheadand gives various other marks of discontent and agitation  Lady  Mary  observes him with attention then sidles up to him  Lady M  By the good humour you appear in my Lord I venture to mention to you my distresses I know the virtues of Lady Priory make my failings conspicuous but then consider the different modes to which we have been habituatedshe excluded from temptation  Lord Pri  Noshe shuns temptation Has she not in this very house been compelled to make exertions Has she not detected and exposed both Mr Mandred and Mr Bronzely  Lady M  Bronzely Bronzely How  Aside  Another rival  Lord Pri  She has not done with  him  yet I believe for to tell the truth he is now with her at my house in Parkstreet He taxed me with being jealous of my wifeto prove in what contempt I held the accusation I left them together and bid him make love to her  Lady M  Is that possible  Lord Pri  I can't say I would have done so rash an action had I been married to some womento you for instancebut I have not a doubt of Lady Priory's safety her mind I know is secure and I have servants in the house to protect her from personal outrage The only fear is lest  he  should have received one for it is now near two hours  looking at his watch  since I came away and I have neither seen nor heard any thing of either of themBut to your Ladyship's concerns  Lady M  I am this instant my Lord in the power of an implacable creditor and without a friend who will give bond for a certain sum I mustI blush to name itbe taken to a prison  Lord Pri  I am not at all surprised at the circumstance Madam but it amazes me that you should apply to me for deliverance You have a brother in town why not send to him  Lady M  He was my friend the very last time a distress of this kind besell me  weeps  Lord Pri  Ask Mr Norberry  Lady M  He was my friend the time before  Lord Pri  Mr Bronzely then  Lady M  And Bronzely the time before that  Enter  Oliver  Lord Pri  Ah Oliver I am glad to see you my good fellow Hah what have you done with Mr Bronzely  Oli  Nay my Lord that I can't tell I can't tell what he has done with himself  Lord Pri  How long has he been gone from my house  Oli  He is not gone yet as I know of for none of the servants let him out  Lord Pri  Not gone and you can't tell where he is  Oli  No that we can't we have looked in every room for him and can't find him any where  Lord Pri  Not find him  recollecting himself  Ho ho I thought how it would beI thought he'd have some trick played him Where's your Lady  Oli  That I can't tell neither We have looked in every room and can't find  her  Lord Pri  How  Oli  'Tis as sure as I am alive I and the butler two footmen and all the maids have been looking in parlours chambers and garrets every crick and corner and no where can we find either Mr Bronzely or my Lady but wherever they are there's no doubt but they are together Ha ha ha ha ha  Lady M  Ha ha ha No doubt at all Mr Oliver  Lord Pri  Together together and not in my house You tell a falsehood I'll go myself and find them  Oli  You must look sharp then  Lord Pri  How came you to miss them  Oli  I chanced to go into the next room to see if there was a proper fire to get it well aired I know I had taken Mr Bronzely to my Lady in the inner room and I had heard them both laughing not a quarter of an hour before but now all on a sudden there was neither laughing nor talking nor any noise at allevery thing was so quiet you might have heard a pin drop  Lord Pri  anxiously  Well  Oli  And so I thought to myself thought I I'll sit down here for my Lady will be ringing soon however there was no ringing for a whole halfhour  and so then I thought I would e'en rap at the door but nobody called "Come in" So then I went in of my own accord and there I found  Lord Pri  What  Oli  Nobody not a soul to be seen  Lord Pri  Oh she has been playing Bronzely some trick She has been hiding him and in some miserable place  Oli  But why need she hide herself along with him  Enter  Mr Norberry  Mr Nor  My dear friend my dear Lord Priory let me speak with you aloneI come upon business that  Lord Pri  You look pale What is your business Tell it me at once  Mr Nor  It is of so delicate a nature  Lord Pri  I know my wife is with Mr Bronzely I left them together I know he is a licentious man but I know she is an innocent womanNow what have you to tell me  Mr Nor  What I have just learned from one of your servants About a quarter of an hour after you left them they stole softly out at the back of your house ran to a postchaise and four that was in waiting and drove off together full speed  Lord Pri  Gone eloped run away from me left me left the tenderest kindest and most indulgent husband that ever woman had  Lady M  That we can all witness  Lord Pri  I was too fond of hermy affection ruined herwomen are ungratefulI did not exert a husband's authorityI was not strict enoughI humoured and spoiled herBless me what a thick mist is coming over my eyes  Lady M  No my Lord it is clearing away  Lord Pri  Lead me to my room  He is led off by Mr  Norberry  exhausted with grief and anger  Oliver  l  ks after Lord  Priory  then takes out his handkerchief and fellows him off crying  Lady M  Ha ha ha Oh how I enjoy this distress Ha ha ha  The officer who has attended her during the scene and kept at the farther part of the stage now comes forward and bows to her She starts on seeing himtakes out her handkerchief and goes Crying off at the opposite side  ACT V  SCENE I  An Apartment at Mr  Bronzely's  Enter  Housekeeper  and  Footman  Housekeeper  DINNER enough for twelve and only two to sit down to it Come home without one preparationnot a bed aired or the furniture uncovered  Foot  This is not the first time he has done so  House  No but 'tis always thus when a woman's in the case Well I do say that my own sex are  Foot  Hush here they are Run away  Exeunt  Enter Lady  Priory  and Mr  Bronzely  Lady Pri  Only twelve miles from London  Bron  No more be assured  Lady Pri  And you avow that I did not come hither by the commands of my husband but was deceived into that belief by you  Bron  Still it was by his commands your servant introduced me to you and upon an errand which I feared to deliver till I arrived at a house of my own  Lady Pri  What is the errand  Bron  To tell you thatI love you  Lady Pri  Do you assert Lord Priory sent you to me for this  Bron  I assert that in triumph at your betraying to him our private appointment he gave me leave to have a second trial If then you have ever harboured one wish to revenge and forsake a churlish ungrateful partner never return to him morebut remain with me  Lady Pri  And what shall I have gained by the exchange when  you  become churlish when  you  become ungrateful My children's shame the world's contempt and yours  Smiling  Come come you are but jesting Mr Bronzely You would not affront my little share of common sense by making the serious offer of so bad a bargain▪ Come own the jest and take me home immediately  Bron  Is it impossible for me to excite your tenderness  Lady Pri  Utterly impossible  Bron  I will then rouse your terror  Lady Pri  Even  that  I defy  Bron  Lady Priory you are in a lonely house of mine where I am sole master and all the servants slaves to my will  Lady  Priory  calmly takes out her knitting draws a chair and sits down to knit a pair of stockings  Bron  aside  This composure is worse than reproacha woman who meant to yield would be outrageous  Goes to speak to her then turns away  By heaven she looks so respectable in that employment I am afraid to insult her  After a struggle with himself  Ah don't you fear me  Lady Pri  Nofor  your  fears will protect meI have no occasion for my own  Bron  What have I to fear  Lady Pri  You fear to lounge no more at routs at balls at operas in Bondstreet no more to dance in circles chat in side boxes or roar at taverns for you have observed enough upon the events of life to knowthat an atrocious offence like violence to a woman never escapes condign punishment  Bron  Oh for once let your mind be feminine as your personhear the vows  he seizes her handshe riseshe starts back  Lady Pri  Ah did not I tell you you were afraid 'Tis  you  who are afraid of  me  He looks abashed  Come you are ashamed tooI see you are and I pardon youIn requital suffer me to return home immediately  He shakes his head  How are not you ashamed of yourself  Bron  I was not this momentBut now you mention it I think I am  Lady Pri  Repent your folly then and take me home  hastily  Bron  Can you wish to go back to the man who has made this trial of your fidelity and not resent his conduct  Lady Pri  Most assuredly I wish to return But if you deliver me safe perfectly safe from farther insult it will be impossible for me not to shew resentment to Lord Priory  Bron  Why only in that case  Lady Pri  Because only in that case you will make an impression on my heartand I will resent his having exposed me to such a temptation  Bron  Oh Ill take you home directlythis momentI make an impression on your heart William  calling  I'll take you home directly Here John Thomas William  calling  But upon my life it will be a hard taskI cannot do itI am afraidI cannotBesides what are we to say when we go backNo matter what so you will but think kindly of me  Enter  Servant  Order the horses to be put to the chaise I am going back to London immediately Quick quick Bid the man not be a moment for fear I should change my mind  Ser  The chaise is ready now Sir for the postboy was going back without unharnessing his horses  Bron  Then tell him he must perform his journey in half an hourIf he is a moment longer my resolution will stop on the road  Exit  Servant  I feel my good designs stealing away alreadynow they are flying rapidly  Take Lady  Priory's  hand  Please to look another wayI shall certainly recant if I see you  Going  And now should I have the resolution to take you straight to your husband you will have made a more contemptrible figure of me by this last trick than by any one you have played me  Exeunt  Bron  without  Tell the postboy he need not waitI have changed my mindI sha'n't go to London tonight  SCENE II  A Room in a Prison  Enter  Miss Dorrillon  and  Mr Norberry  Mr Nor  You ought to have known it was in vain to send for me Have not I repeatedly declared that till I heard from your father you should receive nothing more from me than a bare subsistence I promise to allow you thus much even in this miserable place but do not indulge a hope that I can release you from it  She weepshe goes to the doorthen returns  I forgot to mention that Mr Mandred goes on board tomorrow for India and little as you may think of his sensibility he seems concerned at the thought of quitting England without just bidding you farewell He came with me hithershall I send him up  Miss Dor  Oh no for heaven's sake Deliver me from his asperity as you would save me from distraction  Mr Nor  Nay 'tis for the last timeyou had better see him You may be sorry perhaps you did not when he is gone  Miss Dor  No no I shan't be sorryGo and excuse meGo and prevent his coming I cannot see him  Exit  Mr Norberry  This would be aggravation of punishment to shut me in a prison and yet not shelter me from the insults of the world  Enter Sir  William  She starts  Sir Wil  I know you have desired not to be troubled with my visit and I come with all humilityI do not come be assured to reproach you  Miss Dor  Unexpected mercy  Sir Wil  No though I have watched your course with anger yet I do not behold its end with triumph  Miss Dor  It is not to your honour that you think it necessary to give this statement of your mind  Sir Wil  May bebut I never boasted of perfection though I can boast of grief that I am so far beneath it I can boast too that though I frequently give offence to others I could never part  with any one for ever as I now shall with you without endeavouring to make some atonement  Miss Dor  You acknowledge then your cruelty to me  Sir Wil  I acknowledge I have taken upon me to advise beyond the liberty allowed by custom to one who has no apparent interest or authorityBut not to repeat what has passed I come with the approbation of your friend Mr Norberry to make a proposal to you for the future  he draws chairs and they sit  Miss Dor  What proposalWhat is it  eagerly  Sir Wil  Mr Norberry will not give either his money or his word to release youBut as I am richhave lost my only childand wish to do some good with my fortune I will instantly lay down the money of which you are in want upon certain conditions  Miss Dor  Do I hear right Is it possible I can find a friend in  you  a friend to relieve me from the depth of misery Oh Mr Mandred  Sir Wil  Before you return thanks hear the conditions on which I make the offer  Miss Dor  Any conditionsWhat you please  Sir Wil  You must promise never never to return to your former follies and extravagancies  She looks down  Do you hesitate Do you refuseWon't you promise  Miss Dor  I would willinglybut for one reason  Sir Wil  And what is that  Miss Dor  The fear I should not keep my word  Sir Wil  You will if your fear be real  Miss Dor  It  is  realIt is even so great that I have no hope  Sir Wil  You refuse my offer then and dismiss me  Rises  Miss Dor  rising also  With much reluctanceBut I cannot indeed I cannot make a promise unless I were to feel my heart wholly subdued and my mind entirely convinced that I should never break itSir I am most sincerely obliged to you for the  good which I am sure you designed me but do not tempt me with the proposal againdo not place me in a situation that might add to all my other afflictions the remorse of having deceived you  Sir Wil  after a pause  Well I will dispense with this conditionbut there is another I must substitute in its steadResolve to pass the remainder of your life some few ensuing years at least in the country  She starts  Do you start at that  Miss Dor  I do not love the country I am always miserable while I am from London Besides there are no follies or extravagancies in the countryDear Sir this is giving me up the first condition and then forcing me to keep it  Sir Wil  There Madam  taking out his pocketbook  I scorn to hold out hopes and then destroy them There is a thousand pounds free of all conditions  she takes it  extricate yourself from this situation and be your own mistress to return to it when you please  Going  Miss Dor  Oh my benefactor bid me farewell at partingdo not leave me in anger  Sir Wil  How will you dictate terms to me while you reject all mine  Miss Dor  Then only suffer me to express my gratitude  Sir Wil  I will not heat you  going  Miss Dor  Then hear me on another subject a subject of much importanceindeed it is  Sir Wil  Well  Miss Dor  You are going to India immediatelyIt is possible that there or at some place you will stop at on your way you may meet with my father  Sir Wil  Well  Miss Dor  You have heard that I have expected him home for some time past and that I still live in hopes  Sir Wil  Well  anxiously  Miss Dor  If you should see him and should be in his companydon't mention  me  Sir Wil  Not mention  you  Miss Dor  At least not my indiscretionsOh I should die if I thought  he  would ever know of them  Sir Wil  Do you think he would not discover them himself should he ever see you  Miss Dor  But he would not discover them all at onceI should be on my guard when he first cameMy ill habits would steal on him progressively and not be half so shocking as if you were to vociferate them all in a breath  Sir Wil  To put you out of apprehension at onceyour father is not coming homenor will he ever return to his own country  Miss Dor  starting  You seem to speak from certain knowledgeOh heavens is he not living  Sir Wil  Yes livingbut under severe afflictionfortune has changed and all his hopes are blasted  Sir Wil  "Fortune changed"In povertymy father in poverty  weeping  Oh Sir excuse what may perhaps appear an ill compliment to your bounty but to me the greatest reverence I can pay to itYou are going to that part of the world where he is take this precious gift back search out my father and let  him  be the object of your beneficence  Forces it into his hand  I shall be happy in this prison indeed I shall so I can but give a momentary relief to my dear dear father  Sir  William  takes out his handkerchief  You weepThis present perhaps would be but poor alleviation of his sufferingsperhaps he is in sickness or a prisoner Oh if he is release me instantly and take me with you to the place of his confinement  Sir Wil  What quit the joys of London  Miss Dor  On such an errand I would quit them all without a sighAnd here I make a solemn promise to you  kneeling  Sir Wil  Hold you may wish to break it  Miss Dor  Neverexact what vow you will on  this  occasion I will make and keep it  Enter  Mr Norberry  She rises  Oh Mr Norberry  he has been telling me such things of my father  Mr Nor  Has he Then kneel againcall  him  by that nameand implore him not to disown  you  for his child  Miss Dor  Good heavenI dare notI dare not do as you require  She faints on  Norberry  Sir Wil  going to her  My daughter my child  Mr Nor  At those names she revives  She raises her head in great agitation  Come let us quit this wretched placeshe will be better then My carriage is at the door You will follow us  Exeunt leading off  Miss Dorrillon  Sir Wil  Follow youYes and I perceive that in spite of philosophy justice or resolution I could follow you all the world over  Exit  SCENE III  Another Room in the Prison  Lady  Mary  discovered sitting in a dejected posture at a miserable table  Lady M  Provoking not an answer to one of my pathetic lettersnor a creature to come and condole with meOh that I could but regain my liberty before my disgrace is announced in the public printsI could then boldly contradict every paragraph that asserted itby  We have authority to say no such event took place  Enter a  Man  belonging to the prison  Man  One Sir George Evelyn is here Madam he will not name your name because it sha'n't be made public but he desires you will permit him to come and speak a few words to you provided you are the young lady from Grosvenorstreet with whom he has the pleasure of being acquainted  Lady M  Yes yes I am the young lady from Grosvenorstreetmy compliments to Sir George I am that lady intimately acquainted with him and entreat he will walk up  Exit the man  This is a most fortunate incident in my tragedy Sir George no doubt takes me for Miss Dorrillon yet I am sure  he is too much the man of gallantry and good breeding to leave me in this place although he visits me by mistake  Sir  George Evelyn  speaking as he enters  Sir Geo  Madam you are freethe doors of the prison are openmy word is passed for the  He stops in surprise  Lady M  curtsying  Sir George I am under the most infinite obligation Words are too poor to convey the sense I have of this act of friendshipbut I trust my gratitude will for ever  Sir Geo  confused  MadamreallyI ought to apologise for the liberty I have taken  Lady M  No liberty at all Sir Georgeat least no apology is necessaryI insist on hearing no excuses A virtuous action requires no preface no prologue no ceremonyand surely if one action be more noble and generous than another it must be that one where an act of benevolence is conferred and the object an object of total indifference to the liberal benefactorGenerous man good evening Call me a coach  going  Sir Geo  Stay MadamI beg leave to say  Lady M  Not a wordI won't hear a wordmy thanks shall drown whatever you have to say  Enter the former  Man  Sir Geo  Pray Sir did not you tell me you had a very young lady under your care  Man  Yes Sir so I hadbut she it seems has just been released and is gone away with the gentleman who paid the debt  Lady M  Do you mean Miss Dorrillon  Man  I mean the other lady from Grosvenor street  Sir Geo  Who can have released her  Lady M  Some friend of  mine  I dare say by mistakeWell if it is so she is extremely welcome to the good fortune which was designed for  me  For my part I could not submit to an obligation from every onescarcely from any oneand from no one with so little regret as I submit to it from Sir George Evelyn  Exit curtsying  Sir Geo  Distraction the first disappointment is nothing to this second to the reflection that Miss Dorrillon has been set at liberty by any man on earth except myself  Exit  SCENE IV  An Apartment at Mr  Norberry  's  Enter Lord  Priory  Lord Pri  What a situation is mine I cannot bear solitude and am ashamed to see company I cannot bear to think on the ungrateful woman and yet I can think of nothing else It was her conduct which I imagined had alone charmed me but I perceive her power over my heart though that conduct is changed  Enter Mr  Norberry  Sir  William and  Miss  Dorrillon  Mr Nor  My dear Lord Priory exert your spirits to receive and congratulate a friend of mine Sir William Dorrillon  presenting him  father to this young woman whose failings he has endeavoured to correct under the borrowed name of Mandred  Sir Wil  And with that fictitious name I hope to disemburthen myself of the imputation of having ever offered an affront to my Lord Priory  He takes Lord  Priory  aside and they talk together  Enter Sir  George Evelyn  Sir Geo  Is it possible what I have heard is true was it Mr Mandred who has restored Miss Dorrillon to the protection of Mr Norberry  Sir Wil  coming forward  No Sir George I have now taken her under my own protection  Sir Geo  By what title Sir  Sir Wil  A very tender onedon't be alarmedI am her father  Sir Geo  Sir William Dorrillon  They talk apart  Enter Lady  Mary  Lady M  Has there been any intelligence of my Lady Priory yet  sees Miss  Dorrillon  My dear  Dorrillon a lover of yours has done the civilest thing by meAs I live here he is How do you do Sir George I suppose you have all heard the news of Bronzely running away with  Miss Dor  HushLord Priory is here  Lady M  Oh he knows itand it is not improper to remind him of itit will teach him humility  Lord Pri  I  am  humble Lady Mary and own I have had a better opinion of your sex than I ought to have had  Lady M  You mean of your management of us of your instructions restrictions and corrections  Enter  Servant  Ser  Lady Priory and Mr Bronzely  Lady M  What of them  Ser  They are here  Lord Pri  I said she'd preserve her fidelity Did not I always say so Have I wavered once Did I not always tell you all that she was only making game of Bronzely Did I not tell you all so  Enter  Bronzely  and Lady  Priory  Bron  Then indeed my Lord you said truly for I return the arrantest blockhead  Lord Pri  I always said you would But how is it Where have you been What occasion for a postchaise Instantly explain or I shall forfeit that dignity of a husband to which in those degenerate times I have almost an exclusive right  Bron  To reinstate you my Lord in those honours I accompany Lady Priory and beg public pardon for the opinion I once publicly professed of your want of influence over her affections  Lord Pri  Do you hear Do you all hear Lady Mary do  you  hear  Bron  Taking advantage of your permission to call on her by stratagem I induced her to quit your house lest restraint might there act as my enemyBut your authority your prerogative your honour  attached to her under my roof She has held those rights sacred and compelled even  me  to revere them  Lord Pri  Do you all hear I was sure it would turn out so  Lady M  This is the first time I ever knew the gallant's word taken for a woman's honour  Lord Pri  I will take her own wordthe tongue which for eleven years has never in the slightest instance deceived me I will believe upon all occasions My dear wife boldly pronounce before this company that you return to me with the same affection and respect and the selfsame contempt for this man  to  Bronzely  you ever had  A short pause  Lady M  She makes no answer  Lord Pri  Hush Hush She is going to speak  Another pause  Why why don't you speak  Lady Pri  Because I am at a loss what to say  Lady M  Hear hear heardo you all hear  Lord Pri  Can you be at a loss to declare you hate Mr Bronzely  Lady Pri  I do  not  hate him  Lady M  I was sure it would turn out so  Lord Pri  Can you be at a loss to say you love me  She appears embarrassed  Lady M  She  is  at at a loss  Lord Pri  How Don't you fear me  Lady Pri  Yes  Lady M  She speaks plainly to that question  Lord Pri  You know I love truthspeak plainly to all their curiosity requires  Lady Pri  Since you command it then my LordI confess that Mr Bronzely's conduct towards me has caused a kind of sentiment in my heart  Lord Pri  Hah What  Lady M  You must believe her"she has told you truth for eleven years"  Lady Pri  A sensation which  Lord Pri  Stopany truth but this I could have borneReflect on what you are sayingConsider what you are doingAre these your primitive manners  Lady Pri  I should have continued those manners had I known none but primitive men But to preserve ancient austerity while by my husband's consent I am assailed by modern gallantry would be the task of a Stoic and not of his female slave  Lady M  Do you hear Do you all hear My Lord do  you  hear  Lord Pri  I doI doand though the sound distracts me I cannot doubt her word  Lady Pri  It gives me excessive joy to hear you say so because you will not then doubt me when I add that gratitude for his restoring me so soon to you is the only sentiment he has inspired  Lord Pri  Then my management of a wise is right after all  Mr Nor  Mr Bronzely as your present behaviour has in great measure atoned for your former actions I will introduce to your acquaintance my friend Sir William Dorrillon  Bron  Mandred Sir William Dorrillon  Sir Wil  And considering Sir that upon one or two occasions I have been honoured with your confidenceyou will not be surprised if the first command I lay upon my daughter isto take refuge from your pursuits in the protection of Sir George Evelyn  Sir Geo  And may I hope Maria  Miss Dor  NoI will instantly put an end to all your hopes  Sir Geo  How  Sir Wil  By raising you to the summit of your wishes Alarmed at my severity she has owned her readiness to become the subject of a milder government  Sir Geo  She shall never repine at the election she has made  Lord Pri  But Sir George if you are a prudent man you will fix your eyes on my little domestic state and guard against a rebellion  Lady Pri  Not the rigour of its laws has ever induced me to wish them abolished  Bron  to Lady Pri  Dear Lady you have made me think with reverence on the matrimonial compactand I demand of you Lady Maryif in consequence of former overtures I should establish a legal authority over you and become your chief magistratewould you submit to the same controul to which Lady Priory submits  Lady M  Any controul rather than have no chief magistrate at all  Sir Geo  to Miss Dor  And what do you say to this  Miss Dor  Simply one sentenceA maid of the present day shall become a wife like thoseof former times  The scene closesShe comes forward  ADDRESS  WRITTEN BY MR TAYLOR  SPOKEN BY MISS WALLIS  WELL female critics what's the sentence say  Can you with kindness treat this saucy play  That gives to ancient dames the wreath of praise  And boldly censures those of modern days  Bring up good husbands first and on my life  For every one we'll shew as good a wife  Whate'er the errors in the nuptial state  Man sets th' example to his passive mate  While all the virtues the proud sex can claim  From female influence caught the gen'rous flame  Nay though our gallant rulers of the main  With force resistless crush the pride of Spain  'Tis  Woman  triumphsthat inspiring charm  With tenfold vigour nerves the hero's arm  For  King  and  Country  though they nobly bleed  The smile of  Beauty  is their dearest meed  And valiant tars should still be  Beauty  's care
