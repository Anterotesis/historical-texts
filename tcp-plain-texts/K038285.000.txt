Gate Holborn C HENDERSON at the RoyalExchange J GARDINER in ParliamentStreet Westminster and C MORAN under the Great Piazza CoventGarden  MDCCLXIV  INDEPENDENCE  HAPPY the  Bard  tho' few such  Bards  we find  Who 'bove controulment dares to speak his mind  Dares unabash'd in ev'ry place appear  And nothing fears but what he ought to fear  Him Fashion cannot tempt him abject Need  Cannot compel him Pride cannot mislead  To be the slave of greatness to strike sail  When sweeping onward with her Peacock's tail  QUALITY in full plumage passes by  He views her with a fix'd contemptuous eye  And mocks the Puppet keeps his own due state  And is above conversing with the great  Perish those Slaves those minions of the quill  Who have conspir'd to seize that sacred hill  Where the nine Sisters pour a genuine strain  And sunk the mountain level with the plain  Who with mean private views and servile art  No spark of Virtue living in their heart  Have basely turn'd Apostates have debas'd  Their dignity of office have disgrac'd  Like ELI'S Sons the altars where they stand  And caus'd their name to stink thro' all the land  Have stoop'd to prostitute their venal pen  For the support of great but guilty men  Have made the Bard of their own vile accord  Inferior to that thing we call a  Lord  What is a  Lord  doth that plain simple word  Contain some magic spell as soon as heard  Like an Alarum Bell on Night's dull ear  Doth It strike louder and more strong appear  Than other Words whether we will or no  Thro' Reason's Court doth It unquestion'd go  E'en on the mention and of course transmit  Notions of something excellent of Wit  Pleasing tho' keen of Humour free tho' chaste  Of sterling Genius with sound Judgment grac'd  Of Virtue far above temptation's Reach  And Honour which not malice can impeach  Believe it not'twas NATURE's first intent  Before their rank became their punishment  They should have pass'd for Men nor blush'd to prize  The blessings she bestow'dShe gave them eyes  And They could seeShe gave them earsthey heard  The Instruments of stirring and they stirr'd  Like Us they were design'd to eat to drink  To talk and ev'ry now and then to think  Till They by Pride corrupted for the sake  Of Singularity disclaim'd that make  Till They disdaining Nature's vulgar mode  Flew off and struck into another road  More fitting  Quality  and to our view  Came forth a Species altogether new  Something We had not known and could not know  Like nothing of God's making here below  NATURE exclaim'd with wonder  Lords  are Things  Which never made by Me were made by Kings  A  Lord  nor let the honest and the brave  The true Old Noble with the Fool and Knave  Here mix his fame curs'd be that thought of mine  Which with a Band Fshould GRAFTON join  A  Lord  nor here let Censure rashly call  My just contempt of some abuse of all  And as of  late  when SODOM was my theme  Slander my purpose and my Muse blaspheme  Because she stops not rapid in her song  To make exceptions as She goes along  Tho' well She hopes to find another year  A whole MINORITY exceptions here  A mere mere  Lord  with nothing but the name  Wealth all his Worth and Title all his Fame  Lives on another man himself a blank  Thankless he lives or must some Grandsire thank  For smuggled Honours and illgotten pelf  A  Bard  owes all to Nature and Himself  Gods how my Soul is burnt up with disdain  When I see Men whom PHOEBUS in his Train  Might view with pride lacquey the heels of those  Whom Genius ranks amongst her greatest foes  And what's the cause why these same sons of scorn  No thanks to them were to a Title born  And could not help it by Chance hither sent  And only Deities by accident  Had fortune on our getting chanc'd to shine  Their  birthright honours had been  your's  or  mine  'Twas a mere random stroke and should the Throne  Eye Thee with favour proud and lordly grown  Thou tho' a Bard might'st be their fellow yet  But FELIX never can be made a Wit  No in good faiththat's one of those few things  Which Fate hath plac'd beyond the reach of Kings  Bards may be Lords but 'tis not in the cards  Play how we will to turn Lords into Bards  A  Bard  A  Lord  Why let them hand in hand  Go forth as Friends and travel thro' the land  Observe which word the People can digest  Most readily which goes to market best  Which gets most credit Whether Men will trust  A  Bard  because they think he may be just  Or on a  Lord  will chuse to risque their gains  Tho'  Privilege  in that point still remains  A  Bard  A  Lord  let REASON take her Scales  And fairly weigh those Words see which prevails  Which in the ballance lightly kicks the beam  And which by sinking We the Victor deem  'Tis done and HERMES by command of JOVE  Summons a Synod in the sacred grove  Gods throng with Gods to take their chairs on high  And sit in state the Senate of the Sky  Whilst in a kind of parliament below  Men stare at those above and want to know  What They're transacting REASON takes her stand  Just in the midst a ballance in her hand  Which o'er and o'er She tries and finds it true  From either side conducted full in view  A Man comes forth of figure strange and queer  We now and then see something like them here  The  First  was meager flimsy void of strength  But Nature kindly had made up in length  What She in breadth denied Erect and proud  A head and shoulders taller than the croud  He deem'd them pygmies all loose hung his skin  O'er his bare bones his Face so very thin  So very narrow and so much beat out  That Physiognomists have made a doubt  Proportion lost Expression quite forgot  Whether It could be call'd a face or not  At end of it howe'er unbless'd with beard  Some twenty fathom length of chin appear'd  With Legs which we might well conceive that Fate  Meant only to support a spider's weight  Firmly he strove to tread and with a stride  Which shew'd at once his weakness and his pride  Shaking himself to pieces seem'd to cry  Observe good People how I shake the sky  In his right hand a Paper did He hold  On which at large in characters of gold  Distinct and plain for those who run to see  Saint  ARCHIBALD had wrote  L O R D  This with an air of scorn He from afar  Twirl'd into REASON'S scales and on that Bar  Which from his soul he hated yet admir'd  Quick turn'd his back and as he came retir'd  The Judge to all around his name declar'd  Each Goddess titter'd each God laugh'd JOVE star'd  And the whole People cried with one accord  Good Heaven bless us all is That a  Lord  Such was the  First  the  Second  was a man  Whom Nature built on quite a diff'rent plan  A  Bear  whom from the moment he was born  His Dam despis'd and left  unlick'd  in scorn  A  Babel  which the pow'r of Art outdone  She could not finish when She had begun  An utter  Chaos  out of which no might  But that of God could strike one spark of light  Broad were his shoulders and from blade to blade  A Hmight at full length have laid  Vast were his Bones his Muscles twisted strong  His Face was short but broader than 'twas long  His Features tho' by Nature they were large  Contentment had contriv'd to overcharge  And bury meaning save that we might spy  Sense low'ring on the penthouse of his eye  His Arms were two twin Oaks his Legs so stout  That they might bear a Mansion House about  Nor were They look but at his body there  Design'd by Fate a much less weight to bear  O'er a brown  Cassock  which had once been black  Which hung in tatters on his brawny back  A sight most strange and aukward to behold  He threw a covering of  Blue  and  Gold  Just at that time of life when Man by rule  The Fop laid down takes up the graver fool  He started up a Fop and fond of show  Look'd like another HERCULES turn'd  Beau  A Subject met with only now and then  Much fitter for the pencil than the pen  HOGARTH would draw him Envy must allow  E'en to the life was HOGARTH living now  With such accoutrements with such a form  Much like a Porpoise just before a storm  Onward He roll'd a laugh prevail'd around  E'en JOVE was seen to simper at the sound  Nor was the cause unknown for from his Youth  Himself he studied by the glass of Truth  He join'd their mirth nor shall the Gods condemn  If whilst They laugh'd at him he laugh'd at them  Judge  REASON view'd him with an eye of grace  Look'd thro' his soul and quite forgot his face  And from his hand receiv'd with fair regard  Plac'd in her other scale the name of  Bard  Then for She did as Judges ought to do  She nothing of the case beforehand knew  Nor wish'd to know She never stretch'd the laws  Nor basely to anticipate a cause  Compell'd Sollicitors no longer free  To shew those briefs She had no right to see  Then She with equal hand her scales held out  Nor did the Cause one moment hang in doubt  She held her scales out fair to public view  The  Lord  as sparks fly upwards upwards flew  More light than air deceitful in the weight  The  Bard  preponderating kept his state  REASON approv'd and with a voice whose sound  Shook earth shook heaven on the clearest ground  Pronouncing for the  Bards  a full decree  CriedThose must Honour  Them  who honour  Me  They from this present day where'er I reign  In their own right Precedence shall obtain  Merit  rules here Be it enough that  Birth  Intoxicates and sways the fools of earth  Nor think that here in hatred to a Lord  I've forg'd a tale or alter'd a record  Search when You will I am not now in sport  You'll find it register'd in REASON's Court  Nor think that Envy here hath strung my lyre  That I depreciate what I most admire  And look on titles with an eye of scorn  Because I was not to a title born  By Him that made me I am much more proud  More inly satisfied to have a croud  Point at me as I pass and crythat's He  A poor but honest Bard who dares be free  Amidst Corruption than to have a train  Of flick'ring Levee slaves to make me vain  Of things I ought to blush for to run fly  And live but in the motion of my eye  When I am less than Man my faults t'adore  And make me think that I am something more  Recall past times bring back the days of old  When the great Noble bore his honours bold  And in the face of peril when He dar'd  Things which his legal Bastard if declar'd  Might well discredit faithful to his trust  In the extremest points of Justice Just  Wellknowing All and lov'd by All he knew  True to his King and to his Country true  Honest at Court above the baits of gain  Plain in his dress and in his manners plain  Mod'rate in wealth gen'rous but not profuse  Well worthy riches for he knew their use  Possessing much and yet deserving more  Deserving those high honours which he wore  With ease to all and in return gain'd fame  Which all men paid because he did not claim  When the grim War was plac'd in dread array  Fierce as the Lion roaring for his prey  Or Lioness of royal whelps foredone  In Peace as mild as the departing Sun  A gen'ral blessing wheresoe'er he turn'd  Patron of learning nor himself unlearn'd  Ever awake at Pity's tender call  A Father of the Poor a Friend to All  Recall such times and from the grave bring back  A Worth like this my heart shall bend or crack  My stubborn pride give way my tongue proclaim  And ev'ry Muse conspire to swell his fame  Till Envy shall to him that praise allow  Which She cannot deny to TEMPLE now  This Justice claims nor shall the Bard forget  Delighted with the task to pay that debt  To pay it like a Man and in his lays  Sounding such worth prove his own right to praise  But let not Pride and Prejudice misdeem  And think that empty Titles are my Theme  Titles with Me are vain and nothing worth  I rev'rence Virtue but I laugh at Birth  Give me a Lord that's honest frank and brave  I am his friend but cannot be his slave  Tho' none indeed but Blockheads would pretend  To make a slave where they may make a friend  I love his Virtues and will make them known  Confess his rank but can't forget my own  Give me a Lord who to a Title born  Boasts nothing else I'll pay him scorn with scorn  What shall my Pride and Pride is Virtue here  Tamely make way if such a wretch appear  Shall I uncover'd stand and bend my knee  To such a shadow of Nobility  A Shred a Remnant he might rot unknown  For any real merit of his own  And never had come forth to public note  Had He not worn by chance his Father's coat  To think a Mworth my least regards  Is treason to the  Majesty  of  Bards  By NATURE form'd when for her Honour' sake  She something more than common strove to make  When overlooking each minute defect  And all too eager to be quite correct  In her full heat and vigour she imprest  Her stamp most strongly on the favour'd breast  The  Bard  nor think too lightly that I mean  Those little piddling Witlings who o'erween  Of their small parts the MURPHYS of the stage  The MASONS and the WHITEHEADS of the age  Who all in raptures their own works rehearse  And drawl out measur'd prose which They call verse  The real  Bard  whom native Genius fires  Whom ev'ry Maid of Castaly inspires  Let him consider wherefore he was meant  Let him but answer Nature's great intent  And fairly weigh himself with other men  Would ne'er debase the glories of his pen  Would in full state like a true Monarch live  Nor bate one inch of his  Prerogative  Methinks I see old WINGATE frowning here  WINGATE may in the season be a Peer  Tho' now against his will of figures sick  He's forc'd to diet on  Arithmetic  E'en whilst he envies ev'ry Jew he meets  Who cries old Cloaths to sell about the streets  Methinks his mind with future honours big  His  Tyburn  Bob turn'd to a dress'd Bag Wig  I hear him cryWhat doth this jargon mean  Was ever such a damn'd dull Blockhead seen  MajestyBardPrerogative  Disdain  Hath got into and turn'd the fellow's brain  To  Bethlem  with himgive him whips and straw  I'm very sensible he's mad in Law  A saucy Groom who trades in Reason thus  To set himself upon a  Par  with us  If this  here's  suffer'd and if that  there  fool  May when he pleases send us all to school  Why  then our only business is outright  To take our caps and bid the World good night  I've kept a  Bard  myself  this  twenty years  But nothing of this kind in him appears  He like a thorough truebred Spaniel licks  The hand which cuffs him and the foot which kicks  He fetches and he carries blacks my shoes  Nor thinks it a discredit to his Muse  A Creature of the right Camelion hue  He wears my colours yellow or true Blue  Just as I wear them 'tis all one to him  Whether I change thro' conscience or thro' whim  Now this is something like on such a plan  A  Bard  may find a friend in a great Man  But this proud CoxcombZounds I thought that All  Of this queer tribe had been like my  Old  PAUL  Injurious Thought accursed be the tongue  On which the vile insinuation hung  The heart where 'twas engender'd curs'd be those  Those  Bards  who not themselves alone expose  But  Me  but  All  and make the very name  By which They're call'd a standing mark of shame  Talk not of Custom'tis the Coward's plea  Current with Fools but passes not with me  An old stale trick which guilt hath often tried  By numbers to o'erpow'r the better side  Why tell me then that from the birth of Rime  No matter when down to the present time  As by th' original decree of Fate  Bards  have protection sought amongst the Great  Conscious of weakness have applied to them  As Vines to Elms and twining round their stem  Flourish'd on high to gain this wish'd support  E'en VIRGIL to MAECENAS paid his court  As to the Custom 'tis a point agreed  But 'twas a foolish diffidence not need  From which it rose Had  Bards  but truly known  That Strength which is most properly their own  Without a  Lord unpropp'd  They might have stood  And overtopp'd those Giants of the wood  But why when present times my care engage  Must I go back to the  Augustan  age  Why anxious for the living am I led  Into the mansions of the antient dead  Can They find Patrons no where but at ROME  And must I seek MAECENAS in the tomb  Name but a WINGATE twenty Fools of note  Start up and from report MAECENAS quote  Under his colours  Lords  are proud to fight  Forgetting that MAECENAS was a  Knight  They mention him as if to use his name  Was in some measure to partake his fame  Tho' VIRGIL was he living in the street  Might rot for them or perish in the  Fleet  See how They redden and the charge disclaim  Virgil  and in the  Fleet  forbid it Shame  Hence Ye vain Boasters to the  Fleet  repair  And ask with blushes ask if LLOYD is there  Patrons in days of yore were Men of Sense  Were Men of Taste and had a fair pretence  To rule in LettersSome of Them were heard  To read offhand and never spell a word  Some of them too to such a monstrous height  Was Learning risen for themselves could write  And kept their Secretaries as the Great  Do many other foolish things for State  Our Patrons are of quite a diff'rent strain  With neither sense nor Taste against the grain  They patronize for fashion sakeno more  And keep a  Bard  just as They keep a  Whore  Mon such occasion I am loth  To name the dead was a rare proof of both  Some of them would be puzzled e'en to read  Nor could deserve their  Clergy  by their  Creed  Others can write but such a  Pagan  hand  A WILLES should always at our elbow stand  Many if begg'd A  Chancellor  of right  Would order into keeping at first sight  Those who stand fairest to the public view  Take to themselves the praise to others due  They rob the very  Spital  and make free  With those alas who've least to spareWe see  hath not had a word to say  Since Winds and Waves bore SINGLESPEECH away  Patrons in days of yore like Patrons now  Expected that the  Bard  should make his bow  At coming in and ev'ry now and then  Hint to the world that They were more than men  But like the Patrons of the present day  They never bilk'd the Poet of his pay  VIRGIL lov'd rural ease and far from harm  MAECENAS fix'd him in a neat snug farm  Where he might free from trouble pass his days  In his own way and pay his rent in praise  HORACE lov'd wine and thro' his friend at Court  Could buy it off the Key in ev'ry port  HORACE lov'd mirth MAECENAS lov'd it too  They met they laugh'd as GOY and I may do  Nor in those moments paid the least regard  To which was  Minister  and which was  Bard  Not so our Patronsgrave as grave can be  They  know themselves  They keep up  dignity  Bards  are a forward race nor is it fit  That Men of fortune rank with men of Wit  Wit if familiar made will find her strength  'Tis best to keep her weak and at arm's length  'Tis well enough for  Bards  if Patrons give  From hand to mouth the scanty means to live  Such is their language and their practice such  They promise little and they give not much  Let the weak  Bard  with prostituted strain  Praise that proud SCOT whom all good men disdain  What's his reward Why his own fame undone  He may obtain a patent for the run  Of his Lord's kitchen and have ample time  With offal fed to court the Cook in rime  Or if he strives true Patriots to disgrace  May at the  second  Table get a place  With somewhat greater slaves allow'd to dine  And play at CRAMBO o'er his gill of wine  And are there  Bards  who on Creation's file  Stand rank'd as Men who breathe in this fair Isle  The air of Freedom with so little gall  So low a Spirit prostrate thus to fall  Before these Idols and without a groan  Bear wrongs might call forth murmurs from a stone  Better and much more noble to abjure  The sight of men and in some cave secure  From all the outrages of pride to feast  On Nature's sallads and be free at least  Better tho' that to say the truth is worse  Than almost any other modern curse  Discard all Sense divorce the thankless Muse  Critics commence and write in the  Reviews  Write without tremor GRIFFITHS cannot read  No Fool can fail where LANGHORNE can succeed  But not to make a brave and honest Pride  Try those means first She must disdain when tried  There are a thousand ways a thousand arts  By which and fairly Men of real parts  May gain a living gain what Nature craves  Let Those who pine for more live and be slaves  Our real wants in a small compass lye  But lawless Appetite with eager eye  Kept in a constant Fever more requires  And we are burnt up with our own desires  Hence our dependence hence our slav'ry springs  Bards  if contented are as great as Kings  Ourselves are to Ourselves the cause of ill  We may be Independent if we will  The Man who suits his Spirit to his state  Stands on an equal footing with the Great  MOGULS themselves are not more rich and He  Who rules the English nation not more free  Chains were not forg'd more durable and strong  For  Bards  than others but They've worne them along  And therefore wear them still They've quite forgot  What Freedom is and therefore prize her not  Could They tho' in their sleep could They but know  The blessings which from INDEPENDENCE flow  Could They but have a short and transient gleam  Of LIBERTY tho' 'twas but in a dream  They would no more in bondage bend their knee  But once made Freemen would be always free  The Muse if She one moment freedom gains  Can never more submit to sing in chains  Bred in a cage far from the seather'd throng  The Bird repays his keeper with his song  But if some playful child sets wide the door  Abroad he flies and thinks of home no more  With love of Liberty begins to burn  And rather starves than to his cage return  Hail  INDEPENDENCEby true Reason taught  How few have known and priz'd Thee as They ought  Some give Thee up for riot Some like Boys  Resign Thee in their childish moods for toys  Ambition some some Avarice misleads  And in both cases INDEPENDENCE bleeds  Abroad in quest of Thee how many roam  Nor know They had Thee in their reach at home  Some tho' about their paths their beds about  Have never had the Sense to find Thee out  Others who know of what They are possess'd  Like fearful Misers lock Thee in a chest  Nor have the resolution to produce  In these bad times and bring Thee forth for use  Hail  INDEPENDENCEtho' thy name's scarce known  Tho' Thou Alas art out of fashion grown  Tho' All despise Thee I will not despise  Nor live one moment longer than I prize  Thy presence and enjoy by angry Fate  Bow'd down and almost crush'd  Thou  cam'st tho' late  Thou  cam'st upon me like a second birth  And made me know what life was truly worth  Hail  INDEPENDENCEnever may my Cot  Till I forget Thee be by Thee forgot  Thither O Thither oftentimes repair  COTES whom Thou lovest too shall meet Thee there  All thoughts but what arise from joy give o'er  PEACE dwells within and LAW shall guard the door  O'erweening Bard LAW guard thy door what LAW  The LAW of ENGLANDTo controul and awe  Those saucy hopes to strike that Spirit
