 THE FALL OF MEXICO A POEM  BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON PRINTED BY SCOTT FOR J ROBSON BOOKSELLER NEW BOND STREET  MDCCLXXV  ADVERTISEMENT  GUATIMOZINO the last emperour of MEXICO having op∣posed the SPANIARDS with great bravery in various en∣gagements was at length defeated and taken prisoner In order to extort from him a discovery of the principal mines he was laid on burning coals The second in command was also condemn'd to the same torture and amidst his sufferings called upon his royal master to be released from the vow of secrecy which drew from GUATIMOZINO these memo∣rable words  Am I on a Bed of Roses  DRYDEN has put these words into the mouth of MONTEZU∣MA contrary to the testimony of the historians  THE FALL OF MEXICO  THE Sun now glitter'd in the front of day  And widediffusing his resplendent ray  Look'd willing to adorn the glorious meed  The realmTo GUATIMOZINO decreed  Whom for his valour tried and virtue known  His country's voice invited to the throne  Now thro' th' applauding clamour of the throng  Th' august procession slowly mov'd along  While in the rear of this progressive scence  Endearing sight the chosen Youth was seen  Rais'd on a lofty seat of burnish'd gold  Which twelve illustrious MEXICANS uphold  The law ordain'd a signal to display  The function mode and colour of the day  A splendid streamer playing to the view  Inwrought with plumage of celestial blue  Mark'd from the summit of a lofty tow'r  Of Joy's great festival the leading hour  This mastersign the distant flag obey'd  And prompt alike the glad report convey'd  Which posting on the rapid wings of sight  To ev'ry city urg'd its speedy flight  Till MEXICO throughout her vast extent  Burst into joy with one declar'd assent  Behold the solemn slowadvancing train  Approach the precincts of the sacred fane  A venerable rude majestic pile  Of time remote which claim'd the stubborn toil  By gloomy Fancy on the portal plann'd  Bold from the sculptor's allcreative hand  Full many a wild terrific image sprung  There angry serpents intertwining hung  There the God's agent Terrour fond to dwell  Breath'd all around his awediffusing spell  See now the train the spacious dome receive  Where clouds of fragrance circling altars heave  Four golden columns with bright jasper crown'd  The hallow'd image of the God surround  Now from his seat the chosen Youth descends  And to that image prompt his footsteps bends  Where ANDALUSIA form'd in Beauty's mould  And high on Virtue's sacred list enroll'd  With fear with love with bashful youth impress'd  Expecting stood the bride of his request  "Deign to partake th' illustrious chieftan said  "The growing honours that around me spread  "Consent the glory of a throne to share  "Be thine the pleasure and be mine the care"  Lo at their side the priest TALEPO stands  And joins in wedlock's tie their willing hands  Then rearing to the view th' imperial crown  The pontiff said "Thou fav'rite of renown  "Warm in whose breast each kindred virtue lives  "Behold the glorious meed thy country gives  "The trembling hand which late to thine I join'd  "Is as the pledge of her loveglowing mind  "So is this crown the thronging votes impart  "The sacred token of thy country's heart  "The radiant wisdom to thy birth allied  "Thy valour in the field of danger tried  "Thy sympathy that wakes at Sorrow's sigh  "These are the charms that glitter in her eye  "Thy valour rushing as th' impetuous stream  "Ah let me linger on th' enchanting theme  "Impell'd thee to resist the foreign host  "That pour their numbers on our wond'ring coast  "And hurl'd like Gods destructive thunders round  "Alarm'd astounded at th' unusual sound  "Our archers hurried from th' unequal fight  "And urg'd precipitate their trembling flight  "While female shrieks and children's piercing cries  "With mix'd discordance issued to the skies  "'Twas then amid this universal fear  "That thou undaunted did'st thy valour rear  "And as the rock that checks the torrent's roll  "Ev'n so did'st thou the flying throng control  "And on each archer's breast to terrour prone  "Did'st pour the warm effusions of thy own  "Charm'd by the spell of thy enliv'ning word  "They face the daring foe with one accord  "With thee the terrours of the combat brave  "And make th' extensive coast one SPANISH grave  "For this thy country decks thee with renown  "And fixes on thy brow this splendid crown"  He ceas'dwhile thro' the wide extending fane  The voice of Gladness pours her plausive strain  Lo now and herald comes with speedy pace  His thought expanding o'er th' expressive face  Festivity resigns her shortliv'd charms  While loud he cries "To armsTo armsTo arms  "Proud of their daring an alarming host  "Of warring SPANIARDS darken all the coast  "Highrais'd on beings of superior force  "They urge resistless their destructive course  "Their chieftan's voice these monsters well obey  "Fierce they pursue where he directs the way  "Babes mothers men are in one carnage trod  "By these new engines of that demiGod"  "Hail to th' event the newcrown'd youth returns  "To meet these foes my panting bosom burns"  Then to the beauteous bride o'erwhelm'd with grief  With plaintive voice applied the royal chief  "The joy expectancy had painted high  "And bath'd in all the colours of the sky  "Flies like the bird who deck'd with ev'ry hue  "Wings gayly by and shoots beyond the view  "Now to the House of Sorrow urge thy way  ANTONIO DE SOLIS mentions in his history the House of Mourning which was frequented in the season of calamity  "Whose darksome round forbids the laughing day  "As there thou shalt revolve the future scenes  "While Fancy lifts the veil that intervenes  "Let Hope celestial inmate of the heart  "Her halfexpanding prospects still impart  "Think thro' the perils that encircling rear  "I shall securely urge my bold career  "And at the closing of th' embattled strife  "Return perchance with fameennobled life  "And fondly hanging on thy neck recite  "The toil the havock of the daring fight  The fair return'd with deep affliction fraught  "When Gratitude first wak'd my infant thought  "And bade me raise it to th' august abode  "In thanks for ev'ry gift the God bestow'd  "In glowing thanks did I pour out my mind  "That thou best gift was to my wish assign'd  "Still with the fond expectancy elate  "Oft would my heart forerun the ling'ring date  "Now as the Sun the splendid hour ascends  "Misfortune o'er the scene her cloud extends  "Ah GUATIMOZINO what voice can tell  "The various ills that darken this farewell  "Expos'd to peril that enchanting form  "The thunder of the stranger may deform  "Methinks I view thee in that blasted state  "Dread spectaclewhat horrours round thee wait  "In vain these anxious eyes attempt to trace  "Ev'n the last ling'ring melancholy grace  "That death bestows"Her voice now fails to flow  Curs'd with the dire presagement of her woe  Behold encircled by her virgin train  The sorrowwedded fair forsakes the fane  The parting fair the hero's eyes pursue  While glisten'd his young cheek with Pity's dew  Lo now commence the military rites  While love of fame each panting breast excites  Two youths whom friendship and whom glory warms  Come to demand the privilege of arms  Beside the statue of the God they stand  And rev'rent kiss the darts that grace his hand  These sacred darts the pow'r above bestow'd  A spirit bore them from the bright abode  And in his passage to the sphere below  He dipt their plumage in the vernal bow  See now at GUATIMOZINO'S command  To tuneful measures move the warlike band  The square encircling an extensive plain  Receives the patriot military train  To them approach'd with speedy march the foe  While on each bosom valour pour'd a glow  But chiefly GUATIMOZINO confess'd  The hero's feelings lab'ring in his breast  There youthful Valour wak'd his ardent flame  There breath'd contempt of death and love of fame  There Intrepidity that scorns to stoop  And softey'd Clemencyenchanting group  O'er these as Fancy stretch'd her brooding wing  Prescient she saw from this assortment spring  Some great she knew not what excelling deed  That shou'd from Glory's hand obtain a meed  Ev'n thus the bard who sleeps near Avon's wave  To whom the Muse her unsunn'd treasures gave  When Genius smote him with his fiercest beam  And rous'd his bosom to some lofty theme  His heart confess'd the something yet unknown  Which shou'd to vigour's full perfection grown  Rise on the field of Poetry sublime  And brave invincible the scythe of Time  Now from the bows the pointed weapons fly  While from the foe the thund'ring tubes reply  OF CORTEZ rushing on a fiery steed  The newcrown'd chieftain dares the course impede  His eye illum'd with Valour's sparkling glance  Deep in the courser's chest he roots his lance  But not his valour does the foe appall  Still bleeding warriours round their hero fall  Now to the lofty fane his troops repair  Whose high ascending tow'rs are lost in air  From whence the MEXICANS with speedy art  Show'r on the foe the deathinflicting dart  Yet then by CORTEZ led still undismay'd  The SPANIARD host the lofty fane invade  The two illustrious youths whom Friendship's hand  Had join'd with her indissoluble band  Beheld indignant smit with patriot grief  The great achievements of the hostile chief  And now JANELLAN thus accosts his friend  "Firm to no purpose active to no end  "See from our gallant men yon hallow'd tow'r▪  "Already ravish'd by th' invading pow'r  "Must this committed to our mutual care  "The same defeat the same dishonour share  "If sothe victor shall not long survive  "A thought that bids my fading hope revive  "A thoughtthat like the thunderflash of night  "Darts on my darken'd mind a radiant light  "But ere my veil'd designment I unfold  "Declare however rash however bold  "Thou'lt not o'ershade with Caution's chill controul  "The splendid purpose of my ardent soul"  VENZULA to his breast his hand applied  And thus beyond the pow'r of words replied  The youth resum'd"From this aerial height  "Bid thy bold vision take its deepest flight  "Down to yon rock far stretching o'er the shore  "'Gainst which the raging waves incessant roar  "Whose clashing voices into stillness fade  "Ere this tremendous distance they pervade  "If Fortune bless what my proud counsels urge  "Yon waves shall murmur soon the victor's dirge  "My secret project I will now unveil  "Should CORTEZ o'er this valiant band prevail  "Should thro' controlment and thro' stubborn force  "Pour like a torrent his destructive course  "When on this summit first he shall appear  "I will advance with welldissembled fear  "And suppliant as I kneel to win his grace  "I'll dauntless lock him in a stern embrace  "Bear him reluctant to yon giddy steep  "Where yawns a dreadful opening to the deep  "And thenceselfruin'd for my country's good  "Plunge with her foe into the whelming flood"  VENZULA answered"Yes I much admire  "What now thy matchless virtue dares inspire  "But wilt thou with an avarice of fame  "The meed of Glory all exclusive claim  "Wilt thou to perils close to Death adjoin'd  "Advance and leave thy faithful friend behind  "In infancy we shar'd the glitt'ring toys  "And in one circle play'd our harmless joys  "And when we quitted childhood's lowly vale  "Where springing flow'rets scent the playful gale  "Still hand in hand we climb'd youth's arduous height  "Whence greater scenes expanded on the sight  "Still our pursuits consenting to one plan  "Like wedded streams our lives united ran  "And wilt thou now oppose the sacred tide  "And bid the friendly waves disparting glide"  JANELLAN spoke"Endearing youth forgive  "The conq'ror of some future CORTEZ live  "Nor mark my fall with Grief's dejected brow  "View from my death the bright effects that flow  "Behold the tomb that Gratitude shall raise  "Illustrious signal of my country's praise"  To this the brave VENZULA made reply  And as he spoke tears started from his eye  "What tho' Felicity thy gift shall stream  "Sunlike o'er MEXICO with brightest beam  "Not all the splendour that her rays impart  "Will e'er illumine my benighted heart  "When destitute of thee its only ray  "Without the hope of kind returning day"  "Thou best of friends JANELLAN said suppress  "Of thy bright amity this warm excess  "Lest shrinking as it scorches I dissolve  "Unfram'd unequal to my great resolve"  "Yet lend thine ear VENZULA then rejoin'd  "Sublimer motives urge my steady mind  "Recall recall that joydiffusing hour  "When gay Prosperity adorn'd my bow'r  "As thy fair sister halfafraid to speak  "With downcast look and blushembellish'd cheek  "At Love's request assented to be mine  "Of fleeting bliss vain momentary shine  "For she in flow'r of Youth and Virtue's bloom  "Was swept untimely to the rav'nous tomb  "As sorrowwounded o'er her couch I hung  "To catch the tones that faded as they sprung  "  The God  she said  now summons me away  "  Far from the confines of th' endearing day  "  Thou of the life I lose the dearest part  "  Thou chosen spouse thou sunbeam of my heart  "  Say by Affection's glowing hand impress'd  "  Shall I not live in thy recording breast  "  If sacred be the suff'rer's last desires  "  Revere what now my parting soul requires  "  I leave a brother by bright Honour rear'd  "  By all approv'd and much to me endear'd  "  Be for the sister's love the brother's friend  "  Nor from his side depart when storms descend  "  The palm of Glory waving in your sight  "In council peril enterprise unite"  "Shall I when danger calls consign to air  "The last bequeathing wishes of the fair  "Perdition catch the base unmanly thought  "By Love's subliming purest dictates taught  "Amid the perils that around thee wait  "View me resolv'd to share th' impending fate  "Now to this spot the foe impels the war  "Discordance screams opposing lances jar  "The steep ascent lo CORTEZ now has gain'd  "Ah mark his spear with streaming gore distain'd  Th' illustrious youths now act their dread design  See at the victor's knee they low incline  Now clasp with circling force th' incautious foe  And close adhering to his figure grow  Their deadly aim his better fate controll'd  With matchless pow'r he bursts their stubborn hold  The heroes blasted in their bold intent  Approach'd Death hov'ring near the dire descent  Then in each other's circling arms compress'd  The last and dear farewell in sighs express'd  'Twas Friendship burning with meridian flame  One causeone thoughtone ruinand one flame  Tremendous moment See they fall from light  And dauntless rush to never ending night  Ye selfdevoted patriot victims hail  Oblivion's gulph shall ne'er entomb your tale  While History to Time's extremest goal  Her stream majestic shall thro'ages roll  Like two fair flow'rets on one stem that blow  Ye on her margin shall for ever glow  This sublime instance of heroic Friendship is recorded by AN∣TONIO DE SOLIS  The royal youth who saw th' aspiring foe  The faintopposing MEXICANS o'erthrow  Felt as he saw proud SPAIN'S victorious scene  The wound of Shame the pointed shaft unseen  That stings the heart yet then to valour true  The palm of Victory his thoughts pursue  "Oh youth of MEXICO once valiant train  "Raze from your radiant life this dark'ning stain  "Say shall the breasts where Valour's flame should burn  "Your lifeless hearts as sepulchres inurn  "Thou western Sun retard thy closing race  "Nor to the Godhead witness our disgrace  "Our souls returning a new contest claim  "Still thy last ray shall on our honour flame"  The daring chief with these exalting words  Each slacken'd heart to Valour's tone accords  And as a cloud by adverse winds repell'd  Returns full oft with double force impell'd  Then sailing pregnant with destructive storms  Diffuses darkness and the day deforms  Till now descending with terrific roar  Bursts from its womb the dire engender'd store  So vengeancestor'd the fierce returning train  Impetuous rush upon the sons of SPAIN  Who ill the fierce destructive impulse meet  While terrour whispers to their souls  retreat  That ignominious counsel they obey  And urge precipitate their speedy way  The warm pursuit the MEXICANS release  Night spreads her starry veil and all is peace  When sudden from the tow'r's aspiring height  The clarion  The MEXICAN Historian takes notice of the  sacred Trumpet  It was not permitted to any but the priests to sound it and that only when they animated the people on the part of their Gods  pierc'd the drowsy ear of night  That sacred instrument whose voice renown'd  Yields rarely to the world its tone profound  TALEPO breathing thro' its brazen throat  Diffus'd around a deepinspiring note  While on each youthful valourheaving breast  Religion her warm energy impress'd  Now tenfold rage impels the martial train  While leaps the pulse thro' ev'ry ardent vein  Fierce they pursue the fleeting SPANIARD host  Who from the neighbouring lake's projected coast  Rush down as on their prey the Falcons dart  And trust to safety from their buoyant art  Vain hope see at the royal chief's command  Of dauntless MEXICANS a chosen band  Prompt as the quickness of the lightning's gleam  Plunge with their leader in the roaring strem  With one bold arm thro' clam'rous waves they steer  With one they raise aloft the threat'ning spear  Thus vehement they urge the hostile train  Inflicting vengeance on the sons of SPAIN  Ev'n till the widediffusing drops of blood  Spread like a scarlet mantle o'er the flood  Of MEXICO the Genius now descends  And near the angry waters as he bends  The crystal goblet that his hand sustain  He plunges thrice into the tinctur'd main  Then soars and on the neighb'ring mountain's height  The radiant pow'r arrests his rapid flight  Where in full conclave a terrific band  The spirits of illustrious chieftains stand  Not with the patriot does his passion die  It breathes'tis Immortality's ally  Still from the tomb the warm affections flow  Ev'n as the sunsetsky retains a glow  "Mark mark the Genius said this precious vase  "Here pleas'd affix here feast your raptur'd gaze  "The vast canal near MEXICO that flows  "Assumes the colour that this crystal shows  "Its swelling surges dash the sounding shore  "Inflam'd and crimson'd with the hostile gore"  Touch'd at the welcome tidings they rejoice  And to the gale commit their feeble voice  Lo now disburden'd of their pressing care  They tow'r aloft and vanish into air  Tho' Victory her sunbright glory shed  Full and unsullied round the hero's head  At Nature's voice he checks the smile of Joy  And fun'ral duties now his thoughts employ  The deathground opening its capacious womb  Receives the dread deposite in its gloom  Now with uneven but persuasive strains  To wake the bosom Harmony complains  While Joy obedient to the magic lay  Dissolves like snow before the melting ray  Now fades th' expiring sweetly plaintive sound  While still as midnight Silence reigns around  Chain'd is each voice while o'er the awestruck sense  Distill the sober horrours of suspense  At length the chief th' expecting silence broke  While pointing to the patriot tomb he spoke  "Hail sepulchre which ev'ry coward shuns  "Thou glorious hecatomb of Valour's sons  "On thee oh sacred altar of renown  "Th' eternal being looks propitious down  "They they are dear to that allseeing eye  "Who greatly daring act or bravely die  "Let this suggestion soothe the bleeding heart  "In which despair has lodg'd his poison'd dart  "To you I speak ye fair afflicted train  "Who weep for brothers friends and lovers slain  "To you I speak ye widows plung'd in care  "And you whose sons stern fate refus'd to spare  As thus he saiddeep from some breast unknown  Burst unsubdued Affliction's piercing moan  Now intermitting now returning loud  At length advancing thro' the wond'ring crowd  A matronform th' attentive hero view'd  Her robe neglected and her tresses rude  With hurried step the royal youth she sought  Her wild eye speaking th' inexpressive thought  Close at her side a lovely boy appears  Now through opposing grief her voice she rears  "Give give to me the virtue that repels  "The whelming surge of Sorrow at it swells  "Two valiant sons in age my comfort's store  "My lov'd my duteous children are no more  "This morn this direful morn a prey to fears  "I bath'd our parting with presaging tears  "That they expir'd on Honour's sacred bed  "That their souls mingle with th' illustrious dead  "Well do I knowand glory in the thought  "Bright Virtue's flame perchance from me they caught  "From me th' instructive lesson first they claim'd  "This bosom nurtur'd and this voice inflam'd  "Yet ill with this vain pomp of splendid words  "My drooping loaded sinking heart accords  "Ah still to Glory's thought despair succeeds  "And th' agonizing mother inly bleed  "This orphan babe to you I now bequeathe  "With Honour's brightest flow'rs his mind inwreathe"  The child halfconscious of the mother's grief  As if attempting to dispense relief  Stretch'd forth his little arms and playful smil'd  In vain the boy her scorpion thoughts beguil'd  Inclining at his call her anguish'd face  Deathstruck she perish'd in the wish'd embrace  'Twas then the hero thus his thoughts express'd  "Fly wounded spirit to the realms of rest  "This orphan child committed to my care  "This tender object of thy closing pray'r  "The blood that warms his breast his helpless years  "But most thy last request to me endears  The hero added"Shall the captive train  "Partake the fate the rigid laws ordain  "As erring friends 'tis virtuous to forgive  "'Tis godlike to decree the foe to live  "Ah then while Pity does her thoughts suggest  "We feel the glowing God within our breast  "Amid the captives one superiour moves  "Whose gen'rous deeds humanity approves  "One whose pure bosom all the Virtues claim  "Respectful man LAS CASAS is his name  "He for Religion's sake Religion woo'd  "Warm at her shrine the priest enamour'd stood  "When cruel Havock bade the war encrease  "Still o'er the plain he strew'd the flow'rs of Peace  "To soothe the prostrate foe his wisdom plann'd  "While hover'd o'er the wound his healing hand  "Yet not to these endearing acts confin'd  "He pour'd the balm of comfort on the mind  "Let then the sacred priest your friendship share  "And at his voice the deathdoom'd captives spare"  He saidand to the God of war ordain'd  A spotless rite by human gore unstain'd  See the character of this SPANISH Bishop so celebrated for his humanity as it is drawn by the masterly hand of the Abbé RAYNAL in the third volume of his  Histoire philosophique et politique  Now see the hero with the wedded fair  While sportive Fancy runs before repair  By Truth conducted to the dim alcove  Where Pleasure rears the rosy couch of Love  TALEPO now the Christian priest address'd  "While Silence lulls the drooping world to rest  "Let us enjoy the conf'rence of an hour  "Within the bosom of this seret bow'r  "Say 'mid the spoilers of this peaceful land  "That rude unfeeling bold destructive band  "Who their base hands in guiltless blood imbrue  "Oh priest of meekness what had'st thou to do  "Say of your country thus inur'd to fight  "Do all in strife and massacres delight  "Say to what rigid Deity ye bend  "If thro' our woes your pray'rs approv'd ascend  LAS CASAS spoke"Compell'd to join the host  "Reluctantly I sought your peaceful coast  "Nor of my country with inhuman joy  "Do all uplift their weapons to destroy  "Nor is the Deity to whom we bow  "Such as your vague bewild'ring thoughts avow  "Indignant He beheld the martial train  "With bloody purpose rushing o'er the main  "Ill we deserve the blessings he bestow'd  "For us he quitted the divine abode  "As on the humble earth with man He trod  "Thro' all her works aw'd Nature own'd her God  "The palsied suff'rer left his weary bed  "While on his cheek Health's brightest colour bled  "And stranger stillthe tenant of the tomb  "Who long had dwelt in Death's relentless womb  "Upborn abruptly from the yawning ground  "Amazementsmitten cast his eyes around"  "Ah highly favour'd race TALEPO cried  "Say wherefore was your bliss to us denied  "God of the Christians speak the crime unknown  "For which an host of Virtues can't atone  "For which proscrib'd disgrac'd this hapless coast  "Is ravish'd of those gifts your children boast  "Ah now LAS CASAS hasten to relate  "The bright effects of your exalted state  "The fruits that ripen from celestial seeds  "Heroic thoughts and burst of glorious deeds  "You pausewhat means that sorrowshaded eye  "That fix'd reluctance that betraying sigh  "Forbear the priest return'd thy vain request  "Nor call the truth from this unwilling breast  "Tho' many godlike deeds our faith endear  "The Christian story blasts th' expecting ear  "The Godhead spoke  Let Meekness as a dove  "  Brood in man's heart the sacred acts of Love  "But mark the strange resultin hostile bands  "The Christians hurry to remoter lands  "To Death consigning deaf to Pity's claim  "The realms unknowing of their founder's name  "From these dire acts they rouz'd to new alarms  "And on each other turn'd their reeking arms  "The gen'ral Faith receiv'd Destruction's shock  "And as a vessel dash'd against a rock  "Was split into a thousand jarring creeds  "Each breathing rage and sanguinary deeds  "Then Persecution wak'd the Martyr's pile  "And hail'd the sparkles with a greedy smile"  TALEPO said"The creed of distant tribes  "From your highfavour'd realm remote imbibes  "No knowledge of your GodAh tell me true  "Bright Virtue's path do we in vain pursue  "Say do we nurse with ineffectual care  "The hope which soothes the pain that all must bear  "Who speaks of bliss beyond this lower sphere  "And whispers comfort to the dying ear"  "Thrice virtuous sage the feeling priest rejoin'd  "Ah let not doubt o'ershade thy spotless mind  "The diff'rent tenets that each nation claims  "To heav'nly pow'r affix'd the various names  "Are as the rays projecting from the sun  "Are but the titles of th' Eternal One  "The many modes of worship as they tend  "To one refining pure celestial end  "Ev'n from that diverse homage may aspire  "A grateful off'ring to th' immortal Sire  "As from the flow'rs of variegated dies  "Exhales a blended incense to the skies  "On us with energy the Godhead beams  "And on thy valiant clime but faintly gleams  "Yet be not thou disturb'd nor fear to stray  "In quest of Virtue far from Virtue's way  "As round his little path tho' gloom'd by night  "The radiant insect throws a guiding light  "So all unerring see to act their part  "Taught by the glitt'ring glowworm of the heart"  TALEPO now to bright conviction won  Exclaim'd enchanted "Oh thou better Sun  "Thy words like dayspring on the breast of night  "Pour on my darken'd soul th' endearing light  "But partial light for still within the mind  "Full many a painful doubt remains behind  "What is that pow'r we Chance or Fortune call  "Who holds her veering ministry o'er all  "Resembling still that spirit of the sky  "Whose secret form eludes the human eye

the slow nocturnal hour  Till as the shades forsook the morning sky  The God of day disclos'd his radiant eye  Which dropping lustre on the conscious main  Shew'd to the deepdesponding sons of SPAIN  A kindred fleet by urging zephyrs fann'd  Triumphant sailing to th' impatient strand  Rich tablature by Expectation glaz'd  By Hope highcolour'd and by Joy emblaz'd  See CORTEZ now emerging from despair  For all the butchery of war prepare  Revenge and massacre the saints that crown  The bloody altar of his base renown  Now goad him on to snatch the wealthy prize  Whose golden treasures glitter in his eyes  Meanwhile Despondence like approaching night  Of INDIAN valour dims the splendid light  O'er MEXICANS her fenny pinions spreads  And on their bosoms chilling feardrops sheds  To raise their drooping soul the chief compels  The magic seers to quit their lonely cells  Three awful forms appearin white array'd  Whose rev'rend temples silver tresses shade  To them TALEPO"If your hallow'd mind  "As Fame reports by Wisdom's ray refin'd  "Can glance into Futurity's contents  "And wander forth to meet the great events  "At distance sailing thro' their long career  "To take their

"Urge urge thy task the fatal Goddess said  "For MEXICO must bend her regal head"  The mystic wheel performs th' appointed round  And mark the chief in chains disgraceful bound  Ah see the youth approach the crowded shore  While from the foe ascends th' applauding roar  Now to the royal dome his steps he bends  So lately peopled with his valiant friends  There there oh fight accurs'd in evil hour  He views proud CORTEZ on the seat of pow'r  Who meanly vain thus loud insulting said  "Is all thy courage and resistance dead  "The loyal troops that tread thy subject plains  "Do they consent to view their king in chains  "Audacious MEXICAN behold how vain  "To war against th' uplifted arm of SPAIN  "Beneath yon plains in some sequester'd scene  "Well do I know that Nature works unseen

her secret toil  "And glut my wishes with the glitt'ring spoil"  The captive hero gave these words to flow  While his eye flash'd defiance on the foe  "These chains but only reach th' exterior form

hand her bosom wrung  He on her neck in mournful silence hung  Now from the chains that frame this fond delay  Victorious o'er himself he breaks away  And now advances by rude ruffians led  With step undaunted to the tort'ring bed  Alarm'd to meet his kindred warriour there  "Oh thou he said who did'st the battle share  "Must thou unhappy youth endure with me  "This last severe result of SPAIN'S

resign'd  Along the flaming couch his form reclin'd  The partner of his fate submissive bends  And o'er the tort'ring bed his frame extends  Yet then unequal to the conq'ring pain  He spoke his suff'ring in lamenting strain  "O royal master give me to disclose  "Where in the mine the golden treasure glows  "I shrink I faint inferiour to my part  "And this frail frame betrays my daring heart"

western sun's expiring ray▪  To VENICE gave a milder day  Till by degrees the ling'ring light  Hung trembling on the verge of night  CAMILLA then with fearful soul  To th' Adriatic margin stole  Where in a bark at Love's command  PLACENTIO took his faithful stand  Possessing now his future bride  He bade the bark securely glide  Which far unlike that gally show'd  That down the silver Cydnus row'd  Beneath whose purple sails were seen  Proud Ostentation's gaudy Queen  Who sure of conquest vain of mind  All languishingly lay reclined  Here Beauty undefil'd by art  Whose bosom own'd a tender heart  Beneath the sails from home remov'd  And trusted to the man she lov'd  A vernal calmness lull'd the deep  And hush'd each wavy surge to sleep  The air along the sultry day  Scorch'd by the Summer's fervent ray  Was freshen'd by a recent show'r  While Silence solemniz'd the hour  The still solemnity impress'd  With awful thought's CAMILLA'S breast  For now by prompting Love impell'd  Now by Timidity witheld  The words which to pronounce she tried  Recoil'd and unaccented died  PLACENTO too alike subdued  They sail'd along in silent mood  And stillness reign'd from shore to shore  Unbroke but by the dashing oar  At length the fair dissolv'd the charm  "Ah wonder not I feel alarm  "Confiding in thy love I came  "And risk'd for thee my virgin fame  "Ah tell me to what place we sail  "For in my bosom fears prevail  "Yet answer not this idle fear  "Where'er thou art bright honour's there"  "The plan I form the youth replied  "To Innocence is close allied  "And fearful of thy virgin fame  "As of her babe the tender dame  "These waves that wander to the sea  "Wash in their pilgrimage a tree  "Which spreads its lowly branches wide  "And dips them in the passing tide  "There in a shade compos'd of reeds  "An aged hermit tells his beads  "He gen'rous sage will join our hands  "In wedlock's unremitting bands  "Then to VALCLUSA we'll repair▪  "Where LAURA'S soul informs the air  "Where PETRARCH'S spirit hovers round  "The guardian of the sacred ground  "Forbidding still that fiend of art  "That shrewd perverter of the heart  "The snake Inconstancy to rove  "Within the paradise of Love  "As when chill Winter quits the land  "The snowdrop does her leaves expand  "So may chill fears your breast release  "Till gently it expands to peace  "Mild as these twilight breezes blow  "Soft as the waves on which we flow"  "Ye walls where first I drew the air  "Return'd assur'd the beauteous fair  "Ye turrets which but dimly seen  "Encrease the terrour of the scene  "Ye stately tow'rs and rising spires  "From you CAMILLA now retires  "Thou tomb whose pious urn contains  "My sacred parents' cold remains  "Ye partners of my tender years  "Whom youthful sympathy endears  "Ye joys that crown my native coast  "Well for PLACENTIO all are lost"  She ceas'dand on her pensive soul  Again an awful musing stole  Such as the twilight scene excites  Such as the feeling heart delights  For as the coy nocturnal flow'r  No more its sweets at eve witholds  So the meek heart at th' evening hour  Its sensibility unfolds  See now they reach the sacred cell  Where Wisdom Peace and Virtue dwell  There bent beneath the weight of age  They find prepar'd th' expecting sage  He hail'd them in a friendly tone  And bade them call his cell their own  Where rose an altar form'd of moss  Crown'd with a simple wooden cross  There too a taper mildly bright  Supplied a pompous glare of light▪  No holy relick richenchas'd  This unambitious altar grac'd  Here Flora Nature's priestess stood  And round her fragrant off'rings strew'd  The hermit spoke"Hail virtuous pair  "May your misfortunes perish here  "Tho' youth be yours yet well I know  "You've tasted deep of human woe  "Control and art and baseness join'd  "To cancel what your hearts design'd  "But now Misfortune's reign is o'er  "And Pleasure opens all her store"  He paus'dand now the youthful pair  Th' irrevocable vow prefer  And now the hermit clos'd their hands  In willing and unvenal bands  Unspotted bands which mutual Love  And Confidence and Virtue wove  FINIS
