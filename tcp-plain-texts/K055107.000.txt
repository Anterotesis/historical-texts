 DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT A COMEDY As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAYMARKET  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN at GARRICK's HEAD in CATHARINESTREET STRAND MDCCLXIX  TO SAMUEL FOOTE Esq  SIR  THO' had this comedy failed which from it's first night's reception was some∣what more than probable I should cer∣tainly have suffered the whole disgrace it is not with less readiness that I seize this opportunity on its better success to acknowledge the obligations which the editor of DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT has to Mr FOOTE  I am indebted to you for undertaking a very long part which in your circumstan∣ces I consider as a particular favour I am indebted to you for exerting unusual spi∣rit in the performance when there was little hopes of putting the audience in a good humour and more don't be a∣shamed when I boast of it I am indebted to you not only for a whole scene the consultation of physicians in the first act but for several hints throughout the piece which had the happiest effect tho' some of them may perhaps have suffered by being cloathed in my language  I am more particularly acknowledging upon this occasion because in the repeated remarks which the newspapers have  thought proper to make on your address to the public the first night this thing was acted they would insinuate that you used the advantage your situation gave you of a personal application to the audience in order to throw contempt upon the piece while that and it's author were immedi∣ately under your protection  However Sir while I return you those thanks which justice and gratitude oblige me to I am extremely doubtful whether the public will consider the favours I con∣fess as any capital exertion of benevo∣lence on your part for they will naturally say that as to your acting the play could not possibly have done without it which after you had received it must have been to your loss and for giving me your wit and humour all the world is sensible that there is scarcely a man living who has so much to spare I am  SIR  Your most obliged humble servant THE EDITOR  PREFACE  THE following piece is a translation of Le MALADE IMAGINAIRE one of MOLIERE's most celebrated productions in the farcical kind Some scenes which could not possibly succeed upon the English stage have been removed and those substituted in which the character of DOCTOR LAST is introduced and for that character only the editor has to answer no∣thing else in the subsequent scenes being intirely his  How it has hitherto appeared upon the stage or how it may appear hereafter is at present of little consequence It is submitted to the can∣dour of intelligent readers who will consider a farce as such and decide upon it's merit ac∣cordingly To add more is needless except thanks to the performers particularly to Mr Sowdon for his kindness to the editor when he stood in great need of assistance and to that admirable comedian Mr Weston by whose excellent performance Dr Last is still render'd a laughable object  PROLOGUE  Written by D GARRICK Esq and spoken by Mr FOOTE  YOUR servants kind masters from bottom to top  Be assur'd while I breath or can walkI mean hop  Be you pleased to smile or be pleased to grumble  Be whatever you please I am still your most humble  As to laugh is a right only given to man  To keep up that right is my pride and my plan  Fair ladies don't frown I meant woman too  What's common to man must be common to you  You all have a right your sweet muscles to curl  From the old smirking prude to the titt'ring young girl  And ever with pleasure my brains I could spin  To make you all giggle and you ye gods grin  In this present summer as well as the past  To your favour again we present Dr Last  Who by wonderful feats in the papers recounted  From trudging on foot to his chariot has mounted  Amongst the old Britons when war was begun  Charioteers would slay ten while the foot could slay one  So when doctors on wheels with dispatches are sent  Mortality bills rise a thousand per cent  But think not to physic that quack'ry's confin'd  All the world is a stage and the quacks are mankind  There's trade law and statequacks nay would we but search  We should findHeaven bless ussome quacks in the church  The stiff band and stiff bob of the methodist race  Give the balsam of life and the tincture of grace  And their poor wretched patients think much good is done 'em  Tho' blisters and causticks are ever upon them  As for law and the state if quack'ry's a curse  Which will make the good bad and the bad will make worse  We should point out the quack from the regular brother  They are wiser than I who can tell one from t'other  Can the stage with its bills puffs and patents stand trial  Shall we find out no quacks in the Theatre Royal  Some dramatical drugs that are puff'd on the town  Cause many wry faces and scarce will  go down  Nay an audience sometimes will in quack'ry delight  And sweat down an author some pounds in one night  To return to our quackshould he help'd by the weather  Raise laughter and kind perspiration together  Should his nostrums of hips and of vapours but cure ye  His chariot he well will deserve I assure ye  'Tis easy to set up a chariot in town  And easier still is that chariot laid down  He petitions by me both as doctor and lover  That you'll not stop his wheels or his chariot tip over  Fix him well I beseech you the worst on't would be  Should you overturn  him  you may  overset me  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Ailwou'd  Mr Foote  Dr Last  Mr Weston  Friendly  Mr Sowdon

it's enough to put any one in a passion to have to do with such indiscreet people as your master I believe he's out of his senses for my part  Wag  He's in love Mrs Prudence and that's half way  Pru  So often as he has been forbid either to come or send after my mistress to persist in spite of all our cautions and interdictions  Wag  He does not come or send child  Pru  Nowhat do you do here then

of safety in the house for now I've brought you up here I'm afraid every moment of my master's surprizing us  Wag  Does the old gentleman always keep the house then  Pru  Keep the househe generally keeps his chamber and very often his bed You must know he's one of those folks that are always sick continually complaining ever taking phy∣sic and in reality never ailing any thing I'm his nurse with a plague to him and he worries me out of my life  Wag  Wou'd I were sick upon the same con∣ditions  Pru  Come come no foolingYou said you had a letter from your master to my young lady give it me and I'll deliver it to her  Wag  There it is my dear  Pru  But am not I a very naughty wench to be accessary in this manner to a clandestine correspondence  Wag  The billet is perfectly innocent I can

AILWOU'D who comes thro' the Back Scene in a NightGown and Flannel Cap his Crutch in one Hand and a small Bell in the other  Ail  O lord O lord here's usage for a poor helpless sick man There's nobody in the house sure there can be nobody they've all deserted me and left me alone to expire without assist∣ance I made shift to muster up sufficient strength to crawl thus far and now I can die here  Drops into the arm chair with a piteous groan then after a short pause starting and star∣ing  Mercy on me what's the matter with me I'm suddenly seiz'd with a shivering fitAnd now I burn like a redhot coal of fireAnd now againshiver shiver shiver as if my blood was turn'd into snow waterPrudence Nancy Mrs Ailwood love wife they're all deaf and my bell is not loud enough neither Prudence  SCENE III  AILWOOD PRUDENCE  Pru  Here Sir here what's the matter  Ail  Ah you jade you slut  Pru  Pretending to have hurt her head  The deuce take your impatience you hurry people so you have made me break my head against the windowshutter  Ail  You baggage you'tis above an hour  Pru  Crying  Dear me how it smarts  Ail  Above an hour that I have been wanting somebody  Pru  Oh oh  Ail  Hold your tongue hussey till I scold you  Pru  Very pretty in troth after the blow I have got  Ail  You have left me to bawl and call till I'm hoarse again  Pru  And you have made me get a great bump on my forehead so put one against t'other and we're quit  Ail  How Mrs Impudence  Pru  If you scold I'll cry  Ail  To desert me in such a manner  Pru  Crying  Oh oh oh  Ail  Are you at it againWhy you pert brazen audacious provoking abominable in∣solentShan't I be allowed to have the pleasure of finding fault with you  Pru  You may have that pleasure if you will and it's as fair that I shou'd have the pleasure of crying if I like it  Ail  Well well have doneTake away these things and get me my medicine It's three hours and two minutes since I took it and don't you know the prescription says every three hours I feel the bad effects of my omis∣sion already  Pru  Lord Sir why will you drench your∣self with such nasty slops One wou'd think the physicians and apothecaries cou'd find suf∣ficient stuff for your craving bowels but you must go to the quacks too and this Doctor Last with his universal balsamic restorative cor∣dial that turns water into asses milk  Ail  That's a good girl go on  Pru  Methinks if one was to take physic one wou'd rather chuse to go to a regular physician than to a quack  Ail  And why so my dainty adviser  Pru  For the same reason that if I wanted a pair of shoes I wou'd rather go to an established shoemaker than lay out my money at a York∣shire warehouse  Ail  If I hear any more of your impudence I'll break your head to some purpose it shan't be a bump in the forehead will serve you  Pru  Eh you old fanciful foolish  Ail  Go and call my daughter Nancy to me I have something to say to her  Pru  She's here Sir  SCENE IV  AILWOU'D PRUDENCE NANCY  Ail  Come here Nancy I want to speak with you  Nan  What's your pleasure Sir  Ail  Stay before I say or do any thing fur∣ther I'll go into the next room and take my medicineI shou'd be a great fool to forget that  Pru  Ay Sir so you wou'd  Ail  I should indeed for it does me a prodi∣gious deal of good though I must take a little cooling physick too in order to correct the juices  SCENE V  NANCY PRUDENCE  Nan  Prudence  Pru  Madam  Nan  Look on me a little  Pru  Well I do look on you  Nan  Prudence  Pru  Well what wou'd you have with Pru∣dence  Nan  Can't you guess  Pru  Some discourse I suppose about our new acquaintance Mr Hargrave for you have done nothing but talk of him for this week past  Nan  And can you blame me for the good opinion I have of him  Pru  Who says I do  Nan  Or would you have me insensible to the tender protestations which he makes me  Pru  Heav'n forbid  Nan  Pr'ythee tell me now Prudence don't you really think there was something of destiny in the odd adventure that brought us acquainted  Pru  Certainly  Nan  Was there not something uncommonly brave and gentlemanlike in that action of rescu∣ing me without knowing any thing of me  Pru  Very genteel and gentlemanlike indeed  Nan  And was it possible for any one to make a more generous use of it  Pru  Impossible  Nan  Then Prue he has a most charming personDon't you think so  Pru  Who can think otherwise  Nan  Something very noble in his air  Pru  Very noble  Nan  Then he talks like an angel  Pru  Ay and writes like an angel too I dare swear ma'am as this letter will shew  Nan  From Mr Hargrave You wicked girl why wou'd you keep it from me so long  Snatches it from her and reads it to herself  Pru  Well ma'am what does the gentleman say  Nan  Every thing dear Prue every thing in the world that I cou'd wish or desire He says he can't live happy without me and that he will by the means of a common friend immediately make a formal proposal for me to my father  Pru  But do you think ma'am that your father will listen  Nan  He can have no objection Prudence  Pru  No ma'am But your motherinlaw may who governs him and I'm sure bears  you no good will The best joke is she thinks she has wheedled me into her interests  Nan  Hush here's my father  SCENE VI  PRUDENCE NANCY AILWOU'D  Ail  Nancy child I have a piece of news to tell you that perhaps you little expect Here's a match propos'd to me for you You smile at that Ah nature nature By what I perceive then I need not ask you if you are willing  Nan  I am ready to submit to your commands in every thing SirDear Prue this is beyond my hopes  Pru  Mr Hargrave has kept his word ma∣dam  Ail  What are you whispering about  Nan  Nothing Sir  Ail  Well child at any rate I am glad to find you in so complying a disposition for to tell you the truth I was resolved on the thing before I mentioned it to you and had even given my word to put it as expeditiously as possible into execution  Pru  I am sure you are very much in the right of it Sir it's the wisest thing you ever did in your life  Ail  I have not seen the gentleman yet but I am told he will be every way to the satisfaction of us both  Nan  That Sir I am certain of for I have seen him already  Ail  Have you  Nan  Since your consent Sir encourages me to discover my inclinations you must know that good fortune has lately brought us acquainted and that the proposal which has been made to you is the effect of that esteem which at the first interview we conceived for one another  Ail  That's more than I knew but no matter the smoother things go on the better I am pleasedHe is but a little man I am told  Nan  He's well made Sir  Ail  Agreeable in his person  Nan  Very agreeable  Ail  In his address  Nan  Perfectly elegant  Ail  Really that's muchVery much upon my word that a man of low birth and bred up to a mean professionfor tho' the doctor has now fifteen thousand pounds in the funds and gets eight or nine hundred a year he owes all to his medicinal secrets  Nan  Sir  Ail  At least so Mr Trash the bookseller that vends his medicines tells me thro' whose mediation indeed this proposal is made  Nan  Mr Trash Has Mr Hargrave any thing to do then  Ail  Hargrave who the devil's he I am talking of the person you are to marry Dr Last whose cordial has done me so much service It seems he is a widower and has a mind to get a second wife that may do him some credit such as his worldly circumstances intitle him to  Nan  Well but my dear Sir  Ail  Yes child I know it's very wellThe doctor is to be brought here today to be in∣troduced  to me and I am really concern'd that I appointed Dr Coffin Dr Skeleton and Dr Bulruddery to hold a consultation upon my case this morning for I have found so much benefit from Dr Last's medicine that I think he will be the properest person to find out what's the matter with me  Nan  Well but Sir give me leave to tell you that Dr Last was very far from my thoughts when we began this conversation In short papa all this while you have been talking of one person and I of another  Pru  Poh poh madam make yourself easy my master can have no such ridiculous design as he has been mentioning to youMarry a young lady of family and fortune to a scoundrel quack  Ail  And what business have you to be meddling impudence  Pru  No business at all SirBut if you are really serious in your design about this marriage give me leave to ask you what can have put it into your head  Ail  You have nothing to do with thatI have told the girl the party I propose for her is rich but if you must know what most in∣clin'd and indeed determin'd me as it were to accept of Dr Last for a soninlaw is the number of invaluable secrets he possesses and this alliance will intitle me to take his medicines gratis as my various infirmities may requirea thing that we ought all to consider my last year's apothecary's bill amounting to two hundred and nineteen pounds four shillings and eleven pence  Pru  A very pretty reason for marrying your daughter to a quack indeedBut after all Sir tell me upon your honour now does any thing ail you  Ail  Eh how any thing ail me  Pru  Ay Sir are you sick in earnest and if so what's the matter with you  Ail  It's my misfortune not to knowwou'd to Heav'n I did But to cut short all these im∣pertinences look you daughter I lay my com∣mands upon you to prepare yourself to receive the husband I propose for you  Pru  And I madam on my part command you to have nothing to do with him  going off  Ail  Why you impudent slut shall a cham∣bermaid take the liberty  Pru  She shan't marry the quack  Ail  Shan't she we'll see that if I get near enough to lay my cane across your shoulders  Rising in a fury  Nan  Dear Sir  Pru  Oh don't hinder him madam give him leave to come he's welcome to do his worst  Ail  If I lay hold of you  Following her  Pru  I say I won't let you do a foolish thing if I can help it  Getting behind a chair  Ail  Come hither come hither  still following her  Nancy stop her there don't let her pass  Pru  I believe no father but yourself ever thought of such a thing  Ail  Help me to catch her daughter or I'll never give you my blessing  Pru  Never mind him madam  Ail  An audacious impudent insolent  Pru  Ay ay you may abuse me if you please but I won't give my consent to the match for all that  Ail  Cockatrice jade slut  Chasing her round the stage  Oh oh I can support no longer she has kill'd she has murder'd me Falls into his chair  Pru  Your humble servant sweet SirCome away madam  Ail  Love Wife Mrs Ailwou'd  SCENE VII  AILWOU'D Mrs AILWOU'D  Mrs Ail  How now  Ail  Oh lamb lamb come hither if you love me  Mrs Ail  What's the matter with my poor dear  Ail  Help me sweetest  Mrs Ail  I will help thee what's the matter  Ail  Lamb  Mrs Ail  Well my heart  Ail  They have been teazing and fretting me here out of the small portion of life and spirit I have left  Mrs Ail  No sweet I hope not Who has anger'd thee  Ail  That jade PrudenceShe is grown more saucy and impudent than ever  Mrs Ail  Don't put yourself in a passion with her my soul  Ail  I don't believe I shall ever recover it  Mrs Ail  Yes yes compose yourself  Ail  She has been contradicting me  Mrs Ail  Don't mind her  Ail  And has had the impudence to tell me I'm not sick when you know my lamb how it is with me  Mrs Ail  I know my heart very well you are feeble and weakHeav'n help thee  Ail  That jade will bring me to my grave She is the cause of half the phlegm I breed and I have desir'd a hundred and a hundred times that you wou'd turn her off  Mrs Ail  My child there are no servants but have their faults and we must endure their bad qualities that we may have the use of their good ones However I will give Mrs Prudence a lecture for her impertinence I assure youWho's there Prue Prudence I say  SCENE VIII  AILWOU'd Mrs AILWOU'd PRUDENCE  Pru  Did you call me madam  very de∣murely  Mrs Ail  Come hither mistressWhat is the meaning that you fret and thwart your master and put him into passions  Pru  Who I madam Bless my soul I don't know what you mean I'm sure my study morning noon and night is how to please and obey him  Ail  Don't believe her my dear she's a liar she neither pleases nor obeys me and has be∣haved in the most insolent manner  Mrs Ail  Well my soul I'm sure what you say is right but compose yourselfLook you Prudence if ever you provoke your master again I'll turn you out of doorsHere give me his pillows and help me to settle him in his chairHe sits I know not howPull your nightcap over your ears my dear There's nothing gives people cold so much as letting wind in at their ears  Ail  Ah my love I shall never be able to repay all the care you take of me  Mrs Ail  Raise yourself a little that I may put this under youthis behind your backand this to lean your head upon  Pru  And this to comfort your brains  Claps a pillow rudely on his head  Ail  You cursed jade do you want to stifle me  Gets up in a passion throws the pillows at her and drives her out  SCENE IX  AILWOU'D Mrs AILWOU'D  Mrs Ail  Hold hold what did she do to you  Ail  Do to me the serpentShe'll be the death of me if you continue to keep her in the house  Mrs Ail  Well but jewel you are too apt to flurry yourself  Ail  My sweet you are the only comfort I have and in order to requite your tenderness in the best manner I am able I have resolv'd as I have told you to make my will  Mrs Ail  Ah don't talk to me in that man∣ner don't Mr Ailwou'd I beseech you unless you have a mind to break my heart  Ail  Alas my love we are all mortal but don't cry Biddy for you'll make me weep too  Mrs Ail  Oh oh oh  Ail  Nay dearest  Mrs Ail  You said something of your will did'n't you  Ail  I desir'd you wou'd speak to your attor∣ney about it  Mrs Ail  Yes but I cannot speak to him about any such thing it wou'd cut me to the heart  Ail  It must be done Biddy  Mrs Ail  No no noHowever I have de∣sired him to come hither today and you may speak to him about it yourself  Ail  I wou'd fain be inform'd in what manner I may cut off my children and leave all to you  Mrs Ail  Alas my dear if you shou'd be taken away I'll stay no longer in the world  Ail  My only concern when I die will be that I never had a child by you and Dr Bul∣ruddery the Irish physician promis'd me I should have twins  Mrs Ail  But do you think my dear that you will be able to cut off your two daughters and leave me all  Ail  If not my landed estate at any rate I can leave you my ready money and by way of precaution I will make over to you immediate∣ly four thousand pounds which I have in the three per cents and bonds for near the same sum which I lent to Sir Timothy Whisky  Mrs Ail  I will have nothing to do with them indeed Mr Ailwou'd you shan't put them into my hands I assure you all the riches in the world will be nothing to me if I lose youHow much do you say you have in the three per cents  Ail  Four thousand pounds my love  Mrs Ail  To talk to me of money when I am depriv'd of the only person with whom I cou'd enjoy itAnd how much more in bonds  Ail  About the same sum sweetbut don't take on so Biddy pray now don't you'll throw yourself into some illness and to have us both sick  SCENE X  AILWOU'D Mrs AILWOU'D PRUDENCE  Pru  Sir there are the three doctors below in the parlour that were to call upon you this morning  Ail  Ay they are come to consult upon my case I'm sorry I spoke to them but it's too late now  Pru  And there's another gentleman at the door in a chariot with Mr Trash the book∣seller who desir'd me to tell you he had brought Doctor Last  Ail  I hope the gentlemen in the parlour did not see him  Pru  No Sir no  Ail  Very well then shew the physician's upDo you my love go and entertain Dr Last till I can come to youI will dispatch these as soon as I can but one must keep up the forms of civility  SCENE XI  AILWOU'D Dr COFFIN Dr SKELETON Dr BULRUDDERY  Coff  Mr Ailwou'd your servant I have obey'd your commands you see and am come with my brothers Skeleton and Bulruddery to have a consultation upon your caseHow do you find yourself this morning  Ail  Pray gentlemen beseatedWhy really doctor I find myself but very indifferent  Skel  How do you sleep Sir  Ail  Very indifferently doctor chiefly broken slumbers  Bulrud  And pray how is your appetite  Ail  Indifferent very indifferent indeed I made shift to get down a couple of dishes of chocolate this morning in bed about two hours after I had some tea and toast with my wife just now I swallow'd with much difficulty a bason of soup and I believe I shall hardly take any thing more till dinner  Skel  But Mr Ailwou'd what are your chief complaints  Ail  Really doctor I am afraid my disorder is a complication Sometimes I think it is the gout sometimes the rheumatism sometimes the dropsy and sometimes I feel myself in a high fever however gentlemen Doctor Coffin here has been long my good friend and physician and by the help of the intelligence he can give you about my constitution your art and expe∣rience may perhaps enable you to find out what's  the matter with me so I leave you to your con∣sultation Gentlemen your servant  Ailwou'd feeing the doctors as he goes out drops a guinea  Stay doctor I'll take it up for you  Skel  Sir I thank youbut I think there was another dropt  Ail  No there was'nt  Skel  WhyI have but two  Ail  But twoOh hoh  gives him another  SCENE XII  Dr COFFIN Dr SKELETON Dr BULRUD∣DERY sitting down with great ceremony then after a short silence  Skel  Brother Coffin shall I trouble you for a pinch of your  taking snuff  Havannah I see  Coff  Brought me from thence by a captain who assisted in taking the place  Skel  Sneezes  Devilish strong  Bulrud  I have often Dr Skeleton had it in my head to ask some of the faculty what can be the reason that when a man happens to sneeze all the company bows  Skel  Sneezing Dr Bulruddery was a mor∣tal symptom that attended a pestilential disease which formerly depopulated the republic of Athens ever since when that convulsion oc∣curs a short ejaculation is offered up that the sneezing or sternuting party may not be afflicted with the same distemper  Bulrud  Upon my conscience a very learned account ay and a very civil institution too I can't help thinking doctor but the gentle∣men  of our profession must arrive much better in them there foreign parts than at home now because why one hears of plagues and pestilences and such like kind of disorders that attack a whole nation at once Now here you know we are obliged to pick up patients one by one just as a body can get them  Coff  Ay doctor and since the great increase of this town the sick lie so scattered that one pair of horses are scarce sufficient for a physician but in moderate practice  Skel  True why there was yesterday the first pulse I felt belonged to a lad with the measles in Dean'syard Westminster from thence I set out between seven and eight my wig fresh powdered and my horses in spirits I turned at Charing Cross for the New Buildings then run through the Holbourn division crossed the Fleetmarket and penetrated into the city as far as Whitechapel then made a short trip to the wife of a salesman who had the gout in her stomach at Wapping from thence re∣turned through Cornhill TempleBar and the Strand and finished my last prescription be∣tween five and six for a tradesman in Cock∣spurstreet who had burst a vein in hallooing at the Brentford election  Bulrud  Upon my conscience a long tour  Skel  Long Why upon the most moderate calculation I could not before I sat down to my soup have run up less than thirty pair of stairs and my horses must have trotted taking in crossstreets and turnings at least eighteen miles and three quarters  Bulrud  Without doubt But you was talk∣ing of BrentfordDon't you look upon a con∣tested  election as a good thing to the faculty doctor  Skel  If you mean to us of the college Dr Bulruddery little or nothing if indeed there should happen to be warm work at the hust∣ings the corporation of surgeons may pick up some practice tho' I don't look upon any of these public transactions as of any great use to our body in general Lordmayor's day in∣deed has its merit  Coff  Yes that turns to account  Skel  Dr Doseum and I were making t'o∣ther morning at Batson's a short calculation of what value that festival might be to the whole physical tribe  Bulrud  Is it a secret to what you made it amount  Skel  Why what with colds caught on the water before dinner repletion and indigestion at dinner inebriety after dinner not to men∣tion the ball in the evening we made that day and its consequences for you know there are fine foundations laid for future disorders espe∣cially if it turns out an easterly wind  Bulrud  Does that make any great difference  Skel  Infinitefor when they come out of the hall in a fine perspiration from the heat of the room and exercise should the wind miss them in crossing Cateatonstreet its sure to lay hold of them in turning the corner into Cheap∣fide  Coff  Without doubt  Skel  We estimated the whole profit to phy∣sicians surgeons apothecaries chymists drug∣gists and nurses at eleven thousand six hundred seventythree pounds fourteen shillings and threepence three farthings  SCENE XIII  Dr COFFIN Dr SKELETON Dr BULRUD∣DERY and AILWOU'D  Ail  Gentlemen I beg pardon for this inter∣ruption but you have been consulting upon my case and I have some particular reasons for coming thus suddenly to desire to know what opinion you have yet been able to form  Coff  To Skeleton  Come Sir  Skel  No Sir pray do you speak  Coff  Before my senior pray excuse me  Skel  To Bulruddery  Doctor  Bulrud  The devil burn myself if I do  Ail  Nay pray gentlemen leave these cere∣monies and if you have been able to form any opinioninstruct me  Coff  Why really Sir to tell you the truthBrother Skeleton  Skel  We have not yet with all the observa∣tions we have been able to make upon your case and complaintsI say Sirand after the most abstruse disquisitions we have not as yet been ableto form any opinion at all  Ail  Well this is all I want to be acquainted with because if you have not been able to form any opinion I have been happy enough to meet with a physician that hasPray Sir do me the favour to walk in here  SCENE XIV  Dr COFFIN Dr SKELETON Dr BULRUDDERY AILWOU'D Dr LAST  Ail  This gentlemen is Dr Last and he assures me that my disorder is a confirmed jaundice  Doctors  A jaundiceha ha ha  D Last  What do you grin atI says he has the janders and I'll uphold itI'll lay you fifty pound he has the janders and the gentle∣man shall hold the stakes himself  Coff  Well but Mr Ailwou'd this is altoge∣ther ridiculous Did you ever see a man of your colour with the jaundice  Ail  Why that's true  turning to Last  every one tells me that I have a very florid com∣plexion now the jaundice gives a yellow hue will you be so good as to explain that  D Last  Well so I can but not for the doc∣torsIf I does it its all intirely to oblige you  Skel  We shall hear how the impudent rascal will bring himself off  D Last  There are two sorts of janders the yallar and the grey  Bulrud  The

has sent me in his place  Pru  That's more forecast than I thought you capable ofBut why have you been so negli∣gent did not you tell my mistress that you wou'd make a formal proposal to her father  Har  TrueNor is it my fault that it has not been done I spoke to Mr Friendly Mr Ail∣wou'd's brotherinlaw who assur'd me he wou'd make it his business to come here this day for that purpose  Pru  Ay but this day is too late it shou'd have been done yesterday for now her father  is going to marry her to another personA rascal quackTho' I think if we cou'd set my master against him which wou'd be no very hard matter  Har  As how  Pru  I don't know any method so sure as by the help of another quack for he falls in love with every new medicine he hears of  Har  Say you so Gad I have a good co∣mical fellow for my servant and there is a thought come into my head  Pru  Hush here's my master step into the next room a little while I prepare him for your reception  SCENE II  PRUDENCE and

very ill  Har  I don't know how that may bebut I was told he was better and I think he looks pretty well  Pru  Poh you're blind he look's as bad as possible and they are impertinent people that say he

You know ma'am a great man for∣merly said that if he spoke to the Gods he wou'd speak Spanish to men French but to women Italian as the properest language for love  Ail  A strange roundabout way of beginning  Har  If he was to speak to his horse indeed he said he wou'd speak in High Dutch as for example Das dick der donder schalq  Ail  So you won't have done fooling  Har  Pray Sir give me leave every master has his methodNo doubt madam you have been inform'd that the adjective must agree with the substantive as thusNanetta bella beau∣tiful Nancy  softly to her  that is you my charmerAmante

you seen my picture miss that's in the expedition room at Spring Gardensevery one says it's monstrous like me Take her to see it do it will cost but a shilling you'll easily know it it's o'the same side with the image thereVenus the methodist I thinks they calls it  Ail  Well but doctor give me leave to ask you and don't be offended at my being a little particular on account of my girl I know you have realiz'd something considerable but how have you laid out your money Have you ever a scrap of land  D Last  Why as far as this here there's my place by Hounslow I bought it out and out the whole concern costis me upwards of fifteen hundred pounds with my pond and my pigeon house and  Pru  Have you any fish in your pond doctor  D Last  No my dear it's not deep enough besides it's in the road and I'm afraid they'd be stole but I have pigs and pigeons and next summer I shall make a new reproach to my house with a fistula that will give us a view of all the gibbets upon the heath then there's a large running ditch that I'll make into a turpen∣tine river  Ail  Come Nancy let me have the satisfac∣tion of seeing you give your hand to Dr Last  Nan  Sir  Ail  Nay nay no coying  Nan  Dear Sir let me beg of you not to be so precipitate but allow the gentleman and me sufficient time to know one another and try if our inclinations are mutual  D Last  My inclinations are mutual Miss and not to be chang'd for the fire of love as I may say is shot from your beautiful eyes into my heart and I cou'd say moreif it was not out of respect to the company  Mrs Ail  Perhaps my dear Miss Nancy has fix'd her inclinations somewhere else and like a dutiful daughter made a choice for herself  Nan  If I had madam it wou'd be such a one as neither reason or honour wou'd make me asham'd of  Mrs Ail  But if I was in your papa's place Miss I wou'd make you take the person I thought proper for your husband or I know what I'd do  Nan  O ma'am nobody doubts your affec∣tion but perhaps you may be baulk'd in the favour you design me  Ail  Well but stay methinks I make but a whimsical sort of a figure between you both  Nan  The duty of a daughter madam is not unlimitted and there are certain cases to which neither law nor reason can make it extend  Mrs Ail  That is to say you are very will∣ing to be married but you are not willing your father shou'd have any hand in the matter  Ail  Dr Last I beg your pardon for all this  D Last  Let them go on I likes to hear them  Mrs Ail  Your insolence is insufferable child  Nan  I am very sensible madam you wou'd be glad to provoke me to make you some im∣pertinent answer but I tell you before hand I shall be careful not to give you that advantage over me  Mrs Ail  You don't know my dear that you are very silly  Nan  'Tis labour lost madam I shall make no answer  Mrs Ail  You have a ridiculous pride about you a vain selfsufficiency which makes you shocking to every body  Nan  I tell you madam once more it won't do I will preserve my temper in spite of you and to deprive you of all hopes of succeeding  against me I'll take myself out of your sight immediately  Ail  Heark'e Nancy no more words re∣solve to marry this gentleman within three days or I'll turn you out to starve in the streets  SCENE X  Mrs AILWOU'D AILWOU'D Dr LAST  Mrs Ail  A little impudent saucy minx  D Last  She has a purdigious deal of tongue for such a young crater  Ail  My lamb don't make yourself uneasy about the baggage I'll bring her to her senses I'll warrant you  Mrs Ail  Indeed my dear you don't know how I'm shock'd at her behaviour  Ail  Are you shock'd love  Mrs Ail  Yes that I am to the soul I thought she wanted to insinuate that I did not love you my dear and any thing of that kind is worse to me than ten thousand daggers  Ail  She's going to faint  D Last  Let me feel her pulse  Ail  A glass of water here  D Last  No no give her a glass of cherry brandy I'm no friend to drenching Christians bowels with water as if they were the tripes of a brute beast  Mrs Ail  Mr Ailwou'd permit me to go into my own room a little to recover myself  Ail  Do so my love  D Last  And do you hear madam take a dram as I bids you a little rum and sugar if  you have any in the house that's what I gene∣rally swallows and I always finds the good ef∣fects of it  SCENE XI  AILWOU'D Dr LAST PRUDENCE  Ail  How now  Pru  Sir a gentleman that says he

brother Mr Friendly and study the practice of physic  Ail  Sir your servant  Wag  I observe you look very earnestly at me Sir what age do you think I am of  D Last  Hold let me tell himWhat age are you ofYou are about four and twenty or thereaways  Wag  By the Lord I'm above fourscore  D Last  That's a damn'd lie I'm sure  Ail  Hold doctor perhaps he has liv'd all his life upon tincture of sage  Wag  Sage a fiddle I have secrets myself that will keep me alive these hundred years  D Last  I suspect this is the soldier that lives in the Old Bailey You'll see how I'll make him expose himself You say you're a doctor who made you so  Wag  Sir I am a travelling doctor and at present have the honour of being physician in ordinary to one emperor four kings three elec∣tors and I don't know how many prince palan∣tines margraves bishops and vulgar high∣nesses passing from town to town from king∣dom to kingdom to find out patients worthy of my practice and fit to exercise the great and noble secrets of my art I scorn to amuse my∣self with the little fry of common distempers the trifles of rheumatisms scurvies and me∣grims give me your diseases of importance good purple fevers good pleurisies with inflammati∣ons of the lungs these are what please me these are what I triumph over  D Last  Ax him can he bleed and draw teethI dare to say he knows nothing of chi∣rurgery  Wag  Have you never heard of my black powder that is taken like snuff and purges by the smell provided that at the same time you swallow three large glasses of laxative tisan  D Last  Then its the tisan that does it Mark that O he's quite a cheat  Wag  Let me feel your pulseCome beat as you should do  Feeling his pulse in a ridi∣culous manner at the same time humming a tune  Ail  Why Sir one wou'd think you were playing upon the spinnet  Wag  Even so Sir for I do not like other physicians with a watch in my hand determine the state of the pulse by that fallible measurer of time  Ail  How then  Wag  By a tune which I believe you will allow to be a discovery new and entirely my own if the pulse moves in concert with the minuet in Ariadne I am sure that the pa∣tient is wellLet me see SirTol lol derolThere we dropp'd a crotchet tol lol derolthere we mounted a minum tol lol loland there a semidemi quaver is missing  Ail  A semidemi quaver  Wag  StayLet me considertwo bars and a halfWho is your physician  Ail  Dr Last  Wag  What that little fellow  D Last  Little fellow What do you mean by that  Ail  Nay gentlemen  Wag  Come come let us mind our business What does he say is the matter with you  Ail  Why Sir he tells me I've got the jaun∣dice  Wag  He's an ass  D Last  Am I so  Wag  Mr Ailwou'd look in my face  Touch∣ing him here and there with his finger  How do you find yoursef  Ail  Why I don't know I find myself some way odd  Wag  Just as I suspected you have got the dropsy  Ail  Eh the dropsy  Wag  Why don't you see what a swell'd belly you have and your eyes starting out of your head  Ail  Really doctor I always thought you had mistaken my disorder  D Last  He has no dropsyhe has not a sup of water in him Let him be tapp'd to try I'll stand to his tapping  Wag  You are an ignoramusLet us hear a little what are your complaints  Ail  I have every now and then a pain in my head  Wag  Dropsy  Ail  Sometimes a mist before my eyes  Wag  Dropsy  Ail  Sometimes a violent palpitation at my heart  Wag  Dropsy  Ail  At other times I am taken with a vio∣lent pain in my belly as if it was the cholic  Wag  Dropsy againYou have a good appe∣tite to what you eat  Ail  Yes Sir

you cure him  Wag  A quack like you would say ay but I sincerely tell the gentleman at once he's a dead man  Ail  Then the Lord have mercy on me  Wag  That is I mean he wou'd be dead in twentyfour hours if I was not to help him but I have the only remedy in the world for it  D Last  Don't believe him he's a cheat  Ail  Give it to me I'll take it let it be what it will  Wag  Then observe I don't desire a brass farthing without you're cur'd  Ail  Look you there doctor  D Last  Well don't I do the same  Wag  But if you are cur'd you must give me a hundred guineas  Ail  You shall have the money  D Last  Its too much I'll do it for five  Wag  I have been at a great deal of pains and trouble and made many experiments in order to find a radical cure for this disease that should be at once safe cheap and easy my first in∣vention was a pump by means of which fix'd in the belly of the patient I meant to pump out the dropsical humour as you wou'd water out of the hold of a ship threescore and eleven people died under the operation  Ail  Well what is the loss of a few indivi∣duals for the general good of mankind You brought it to perfection at last  Wag  No at last I found it was impracti∣cable yet I wou'd have gone on in hopes but people grew chickenhearted and wou'd not let me try  D Last  So they well mightYou shou'd not pump me in that manner for five thousand pound  Wag  Well Sir my next experiment was call'd the soaking operation which was con∣triv'd thus I made the patient swallow a piece of spunge fasten'd to a string which going down his throat into his stomach I let lye there till it had absorb'd or soak'd up the watery hu∣mours  and then drew it up again with all it contents repeating the operation till I had lef the body as dry as an empty decanter  Ail  Well Sir and what success  Wag  Why I had a great deal better success with this than the former for I think it kill'd but four and twenty  D Last  Well take my advice Mr Ailwou'd neither be pump'd nor soak'd  Wag  The gentleman has nothing to fear what I shall make use of upon this occasion is my great dryer or essence infernalisYou see this little phial  D Last  Let me see itand I'll make bold to taste it tooDon't touch it Mr Ailwou'd don't touch it its corroding supplement and will throw you into a salvation  Wag  Not a grain of mercury in it upon my honour nothing but simples  Ail  Pray give the phial to me I think I can distinguish for I have taken a great many of these thingsI vow to man it tastes to me like strong beer or porter  Wag  Aside  By the Lord he has guess'd itObserve me Sir it is a tincture drawn from rat'sbane arsenic laudanum verdigrease cop∣peras with a convenient mixture of the juice of hemlock You see Sir I despise quackery I tell you fairly what my medicines are  D Last  Medicines do you call 'em  Wag  Give it cat dog mouse rat or in short any creature bypede or quadrupede of the brute creation they are immediately thrown into the most intolerable torments swell like a tun and burst before your eyes  Ail  A fine medicine indeed  Wag  Well I will let you take the contents of this whole bottle and if it does you any more harm than so much newmilk I'll give you leave to knock me down  Ail  Knock you down  Wag  Nay more if you had infirmities from head to foot the first dose will cure you of every one of them  Ail  Yes indeed I believe it wou'd  Wag  Tell me Mr Ailwou'd what do you do with this arm  Ail  My arm  Wag  Take my advice cut off this arm im∣mediately  Ail  The deuce Cut off my arm  Wag  It is the new method of practice that I mean to introduce Don't we prune trees of their branches to make them more healthy And don't you see that this arm draws all the nourishment to itself and hinders the other from thriving  Ail  Ay but I have occasion for my arm  Wag  Here's an eye too which I would have instantly pluck'd out were I in your place  Ail  Pluck out my eye  Wag  Don't you see it injures the other and occasions these mists you complain'd of but now Be guided by me and have it taken away di∣rectly you'll see the better with your left  D Last  I tell you Mr Ailwou'd this is some cheat  Ail  I begin to suspect soHark'e sirrah who sent you here Are you come to murder me  Wag  Oh Sir if you're in a passion your servant  D Last  Ay but you shan't get off soStop thief  Wag  Nay then I must take to my heels  Throws his wig at Last and runs off  Ail  Did you ever see such an impudent scoundrel  D Last  Do you keep the wig we can swear to the wig while I follow and find out who he isI'm almost sure he's the soldier in the Old Bailey for he has a spite against me and em∣ploys old women to tear down my advertise∣ments  SCENE XIII  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY PRUDENCE  Ail  AhI'm quite overcome I can't sup∣port myself any longer  Pru  Your brother Mr Friendly Sir  Friend  How now What's the matter  Ail  O Mr Friendly your servantbut I wonder you are not asham'd to see my face did you think my sickly habit wou'd not put me out of the world soon enough but you must join with wretches to drive me hence  Friend  I don't understand you  Ail  How could you send me that wicked monster who under the name of a doctor wanted to give

impostorand indeed my dear brother you lay yourself too open to the practice of such fellows who are acquainted with your weakness and take advantage of it  Ail  My weakness is great indeed as you may see  Friend  How do you find yourself today then  Ail  Extremely ill indeed  Friend  How extremely  Ail  In a condition so faint and feeble that I am not able to stir  Friend  Indeed  Ail  I have

III  FRIENDLY AILWOU'D  Friend  Come now brother I must insist up∣on it that you will not put yourself in a passion but sit down here and let me resume the con∣versation which we just now broke off  Ail  Well come let it be so  Friend  You are to be cool now remember  Ail  Ay ay I'll be cool  Friend  And to answer me without prevarica∣tion  Ail  Good Lord yes here's a terrible pre∣amble sure  Friend  How comes it then brother give me leave to ask you once more that being in the circumstances you are and having no other children but two daughters you can entertain the strange design of marrying your eldest in the manner you are going to dispose of her  Ail  Pray brother how comes it that I am master of my own family and dispose of my children as I like  Friend  Your wife no doubt is glad to get rid of her at any rate  Ail  Oh ay now it comesand the poor wife is to be dragg'd in 'tis she does all the mischief to be sure and all the world will have it so  Friend  No no brother we'll leave her out of the question she's a good woman that has the best intentions in the world for your family is free from all manner of selfinterest has a marvellous tenderness for you and shews an in∣conceivable affection to your children that's certainWe'll say no more therefore of her but return to your daughter but pray let me ask you with what view wou'd you marry her to this Dr Last  Ail  With a view of having so skillful a phy∣sician as Dr Last related to me  Friend  Heav'ns Brother how can you talk soSkillfulI never saw the man but I'm told that of all the quacks in town numerous as they are he is the most ignorant as well as the most impudent but it is really shocking to humanity to consider to what a head these dangerous cheats are arriv'd in this great city and it is not less amazing that people shou'd confide their health their most valuable posses∣sion  to wretches they wou'd not trust with any thing else in short I know no way of putting a stop to their progress but by an unlimited act against the vending of poisons which I think would very fairly comprehend them  Ail  HaYou have made a very fine speech nowDo you think if the cures they per∣form were not wonderful people wou'd take their medicines so kindlyWhat has essence of waterdock done for the scurvyWhat balsam of honey in colds and consumptionsThe stomach pills for cholicky complaintsThen you senseless idiot you d'ye think his majesty wou'd give his royal letters patent for pills essences electuaries cordials tinctures quintessences to poison his subjectsBut to strike you dumb at once is not that blessed medicine baume de vie in itself a remedy for all disorders under heaven  Friend  All  Ail  Look at the list of curesthen the rea∣soning's goodAll disorders spring from the stomachBaume de vie is a sovereign remedy for the stomachand therefore cures all disor∣ders  Friend  If so why don't you take it and get rid of yours  Ail  Why whyThere's no general rule without an exception  Friend  Come come brother the truth of it is there's nothing the matter with you at all and I desire no better proof of the excellency of your constitution than that all the slops you have been taking these ten years have not burst or otherwise destroy'd you  Ail  Here's Dr Last he is so good as to come on purpose to administer his medicine to me himself Pray now brother behave yourself properly  SCENE IV  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY and Dr LAST with a Vial in one Hand and a Glass of Water in the other  D Last  Come Mr Ailwou'd  Ail  Brother with your leave  Friend  What are you going to do now  Ail  To take some of Dr Last's cordial and let me prevail upon you to take a glass too  D Last  Do Sir one dose it's as natural to a man's constitution as breastmilk and if you will take it for a continency once you are a little manured to it it will work the most sur∣prisingest difference  Friend  Pray Sir what is it  D Last  Sir I wou'd not tell you if you were my father no nor king George but I'll shew youYou see this glass of New River waterit's as transparent as rock crystialNow I puts twelve drops of my cordial into itand thereits as fine assesmilk as ever was tastedI vow to the Lord there's worse sold for a shilling a pint that comes from the beastis themselves  Ail  Well I believe that's very true  D Last  I presume by your wig Sir that you belong to the law and if you'll put your∣self under my care I'll give you something for which you'll be oblig'd to me and yet its no∣thing  but the juice of a simple yerb but I've tried it upon several gentlemen in your way who from being sheep as it were have become as bold as lions  Ail  Attend to this brother for its worth listening to  D Last  Then its one of the beautifullest things upon yearth for the memoryThere was a little boy seven years of age did not know one of his lettersHis papa was angry his mam∣ma was uneasyThey bought him the pretty books for children letters in sweetmeats gin∣gerbread ivory all manner of playthings to make him take to his larning but it wou'd not do hearing of my secret they apply'd to me I gave the child a dose and will you believe it upon the word of an honest manhe cou'd say his crisscrossrow in a fortnight  Ail  Now that's very amazing I'll make use of it myself and begin to read immediately for I never remember a word after the book is shut and that's vexatious you know  D Last  And would you believe that this fine remedy was invented by my old mother  Ail  Your mother  D Last  Why she knows as much of physic as I do its a gift in our family and she has invented things to take spots out of cloaths and ironmolds out of linen  Ail  I long to be acquainted with her  D Last  Well will you swallow this now  Ail  Ay come give it to me  Friend  You jest sureCan't you be a mo∣ment without some nasty slop or another put it off to a more convenient time and give na∣ture a little respite  Ail  Well then this evening Dr Last or tomorrow morning  D Last  Pray Sir may I be so bold as to ax if your name aint Groggins  Friend  No Sir my name's Friendly  D Last  Then Sir I desire to know Sir what business you have to hinder me in my occupationI say the gentleman shall take it now and I warrant it will do him good  Friend  Pr'ythee man what d'ye mean  D Last  I means what I saysMr Ailwou'd will you take itIf you don't take it I'll go away directly  Friend  Well do go away Sir we desire it  D Last  O with all my heart  SCENE V  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY  Ail  Brother you'll be the cause of some mis∣chief here  Friend  What mischiefNo no brother I shall be the cause of no mischief but a great deal of good and I wish I cou'd drive away all the physicmongers that come after you with their cursed drugs in the same manner you'd live the longer for it  Ail  Some dreadful mischief will come of it indeedI must call him backDr Last Dr Last  Friend  Brother for shame  Ail  Don't talk to me you want to send me to my graveDr Last pray come back  SCENE VI  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY Dr LAST  Last  Fiercely to Friendly  Did you call me Sir  Friend  No doctor but Mr Ailwou'd did  D Last  Mr Ailwou'd I'm not us'd politely here at all  Ail  Indeed Sir it was not  D Last  I have given that there thing to la∣dies nay to children that have been troubled with the worms who never made a wry face but lick'd their lips after it as pleasantly as if it had been so much treacle or sugarcandy  Ail  It was not I  D Last  And when I took the trouble of com∣ing myself  Ail  'Twas he  D Last  In my own chariot  Ail  He was the cause  D Last  Without demanding nothing extra∣ordinary for my troubleI have a good mind not to marry your daughter  Ail  I tell you it was all my brother it was upon my word and creditBut give me the cordial and to make you amends I'll take double the quantity  Friend  Are you mad  D Last  No he's notI insist upon his taking it for the honour of my medicineAnd if you don't take a glass too you shall hear further from me  Friend  Very well doctor I fear your sword less than your poison  D Last  O ay poison poison we shall see whether it's poison  Ail  Give it to me doctor  D Last  Here Mr Ailwou'd  Ail  Pray now brother let me prevail upon you in compliment to the doctor  Friend  Nay good brother don't be absurd  D Last  Now I'm satisfied and I'll call upon you again in an hour  SCENE VII  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY PRUDENCE  Ail  Prudence  Pru  Sir  Ail  Get me my arm'd chair hereIt's incon∣ceivable what a warmth this med'cine diffuses all over my body  Friend  Well but brother did not you hear Dr Last say just now that he was in doubt whether he wou'd marry your daughter or not and after so slighting an expression surely you will not persist in your design but let me talk to you of this gentleman who wishes to have my niece  Ail  No brother if Dr Last won't have her I'll send her to France and put her in a con∣vent I'm sure she has an amorous inclination for somebody and to let you know I have dis∣cover'd secret interviews in my house which some people don't think I've discover'd  Friend  I dare swear brother my niece has no attachment but to th  gentleman I have men∣tioned to you in which case you have nothing to be angry with all tending to the honourable purpose of marriage  Ail  I don't care for what you say I'll send her over to France I'm determined on it  Friend  There's somebody you want to please brother by that I doubt  Ail  I know your meaning Sir you're always harping upon the same strainMy wife is a strange hobgoblin in your eyes brother  Friend  Yes brother since 'tis necessary to be plain with you 'tis your wife that I mean and I can no more bear your ridiculous fondness for her than that you have for physic nor endure to see you run hand overhead into all the snares she lays for you  Pru  O dear Sir don't speak so of my lady she's a woman that nobody can say any thing against a woman without the least grain of arti∣fice or design and loves my masterThere's no saying how much she loves him  Ail  Ay only ask her how excessive fond she is of me  Pru  Most excessive  Ail  How much concern my illness gives her  Pru  Yes  Ail  And the care and pains she takes about me  Pru  RightShall we convince you now Mr Friendly and shew you directly what a sur∣prising affection my lady has for my masterPermit me Sir to undeceive him and let him see his mistake  Ail  As how Prudence  Pru  Hark my lady is just return'dDo you step into the next room therestretch your∣self out and feign yourself dead he may slip into the closet I'll set the doors open and you'll see what violent grief she'll be in when I tell her the news  Ail  HeyhumI profess I have a mind to take her advicebut no I can never bear to hear the shrieks and lamentations she'll make over me and yet 'twill be a comfort to me to hear them too to feel her virtuous tears bedew my face and her sweet lips kissing my cheeks a thousand times to bring me back again to life and herah verily I'll do it verily I'll do it and then Sir what will become of your fine sur∣misesBut Prudence art thou not afraid that her very thinking me dead will break her heart  Pru  To be sure Sir if you shou'd keep her in her fright too long  Ail  O let me alone for that I'll make the experiment this very minute this very minuteBut is there no danger in feigning one's self dead  Pru  No no what danger shou'd there be 'Tis only shutting your eyes and stretching yourself out  To Friendly  Now Sir we shall shew you your error and convince yow how much you have injur'd the best of wives  To Ailwou'd  'Twill be pleasant enough afterwards to see how blank he will lookHere's my lady quick quick both of you away  SCENE VIII  PRUDENCE Mrs AILWOU'D  Pru  Oh Heav'ns Oh fatal misfortune what a strange accident is this  Mrs Ail  What's the matter Prudence  Pru  Crying  Ah madam  Mrs Ail  What is it What do you mean by blubbering pr'ythee  Pru  My master's dead madam  Mrs Ail  Dead  Pru  Sobbing  Yeyeyes  Mrs Ail  Are you sure of it  Pru  Too sure alas No body yet knows any thing of this accident there was not a soul but myself to help him he sunk down in my arms and went off like a childSee there madam he lies stretch'd out in the next room  Mrs Ail  Now Heav'n be prais'dWhat a simpleton art thou to cry  Pru  Cry ma'am why I thought we were to cry  Mrs Ail  And for what prayI know of no loss he isWas he of any use upon earthA man troublesome to all the world odious in his person disgusting in his manners never without some filthy medicine in his mouth or his stomach continually coughing hawking and spitting a tiresome peevish disagreeable monster  Pru  An excellent funeral sermon truly  Aside  Mrs Ail  Prudence you must assist me in the execution of my design and you may depend upon it I will amply reward your services since by good fortune no one is yet appris'd of this accident besides ourselves let us keep his death a secret a few days till I have been able to settle my affairs on a sure foundation there are papers and money of which I wou'd possess myselfNor indeed is it just that all I have suffer'd with him living shou'd not be rewarded by some advantage at his death  Pru  To be sure madam  Mrs Ail  In the mean time I'll go and secure his keys for I know he has a considerable sum of money in his scrutore which he receiv'd yesterday  SCENE IX  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY PRUDENCE and Mrs AILWOU'D who going to the Door meets her husband and screams  Mrs Ail  Ah ah ah  Screaming  Ail  O devil of a helpmate have I found you out  Friend  Your servant madam  Mrs Ail  Lord my dear I'm so disappointedso pleas'd I mean and so frighten'dThis wicked girl told me you were dead  Ail  Yes and a fine oration you pronounc'd over me  Mrs Ail  Nay but my dear this is the most unreasonable thing  Turning to Friendly  some slight conversation that I have had with my maid here which Mr Ailwou'd takes in a wrong sense but I dare swear when he has consider'd the matter a little he will think differently  Ail  Get out of my sight get out of my sight  Mrs Ail  Well but lovey let me explain the matter to you  Ail  I'll never hear a word from you again as as long as I live  Mrs Ail  Nay Sir if you bear yourself so haughtily you'll find me a match for you It is not today my dear I am to learn that your brain is full of maggots however you shall call me more than once before I come back to you I assure you  SCENE X  AILWOU'D FRIENDLY PRUDENCE and then NANCY and HARGRAVE  Ail  Did you ever hear such an impudent crea∣tureOd's my life with what an air she carried itBut do'st think she was in earnest Pru∣dence  Pru  Troth do I Sir  Friend  Come brother to tell you the plain truth Prudence devis'd this method in order to open your eyes to your wife's perfidyShe has long deceiv'd you with a shew of false ten∣derness but now you see her in her genuine colours  Ail  I profess my eyes are dazzled and all my senses confus'd I know not what I either hear or see but in the first place I renounce physic  Pru  Lord Sir here's Miss Nancy and Mr Hargrave  Nan  Dear papa what's the matter  Ail  The matter child I don't know child  Seeing Hargrave  What brings you here Sir  Friend  This brother is the young gentle∣man I propose as a match for your daughter and after what I have said and what has hap∣pen'd I hope you will no longer refuse to listen to his prentions  Ail  Why really Sir my chief objection to you is your total ignorance of the medicinal art if you can think of any method to re∣move that  Har  I must own Sir I'm afraid I am rather too far advanc'd in life to make any progress in so deep and abstracted a study  Ail  Why with regard to the more capital branches I grant you but in the subaltern of∣fices I'm of a contrary opinion suppose now you were to bind yourself apprentice for a year or two to some skilful apothecary surely in that time you might learn to decypher a pre∣scription and make up a medicine with very few blunders  Har  D'ye think so Sir  Ail  You might indeed now and then give a dose of arsenick for salts but that's an acci∣dent might happen to the oldest practitioner  Friend  Ah brother brother what's this I hear It was but this moment you were deter∣min'd to renounce physic and here you are talk∣ing as warmly and absurdly about it as ever  Ail  EhIt's very true indeed brotherHowever let it suffice I give the young man my daughter without any conditions at all and now I'll go and get effectually rid of that other plague my wife for I shall not be easy while we areunder the same roof  SCENE XI  FRIENDLY HARGRAVE PRUDENCE NANCY  Friend  If we can't cure him of his love for drugs we have done nothing  Nan  I doubt Sir that will be impossible  Friend  Hist here comes Dr LastI'll take the opportunity of your father's absence to have  some sport with him put on melancholly coun∣tenances and take your cues from me  Pru  I know what you'd be at Sir and I'll second you  SCENE XII  FRIENDLY HARGRAVE PRUDENCE NANCY Dr LAST and afterwards AILWOU'D  D Last

youWhere is Mr Ailwou'd  Friend  Where is he Sir  D Last  Ay because I wants to speak to him  Friend  He's dead Sir  Pru  Bursting ridiculously into tears  Oh oh oh  D Last  What's the matter Mrs Prudence I warrant your master is only in a sound and I've a bottle of stuff in my pocket that will fetch him in a whiff  Friend  Hold Sir no more of your stuff  D Last  Well then let me go and feel his pulse  Friend  Nor that neither you shan't go near him but we insist upon your telling us what you gave him out of your vial just now  D Last  How tell you my secretA book∣seller offer'd me a thousand pounds for it  Har  A bookseller offer'd you a thousand pound That may be Sir but Mr Ailwou'd  died a few minutes after you administer'd it we therefore take it for granted that it has poison'd him and unless you prove very clearly to the contrary we shall consider you as his murderer and treat you accordingly  D Last  O don't think to humbug me so  Ail  Enters behind  What are they doing here  Nan  Dear Sir have patienceStop where you are a little and let them go on  Friend  Within there seize this fellow  D Last  LibertyI'm a freeborn Briton in my native cityIf any one lays a finger upon me I'll put him into the Crownoffice  Friend  Ay but we'll put you in Newgate firstCarry him before a justice I'll go and be witness  Pru  Ay and so will I  D Last  In a great passion  Well but stay let me go abitWhat will you be witness of  Pru  That you poison'd my master  D Last  It can't be  Friend  We'll prove it  D Last  It's a fictious report for to let you see the difference nowwhat I gave him was nothing in the world but a little chalk and vine∣gar and if it cou'd do him no good it cou'd do him no harm  Ail  And so sirrah this is the way you take people in your famous cordial then is chalk and vinegar  D Last  What Mr Ailwou'd aren't you dead  Ail  No sirrah but no thanks to you for that so get you out of my house or I'll chalk  and vinegar you with a vengeance you pretend∣ing quacking cheating  D Last  Don't strike me  Ail  I'll break every bone in your skin if you don't get out of my house  Friend  Nay brother  D Last  My own chariot's below  Ail  A cart a wheelbarrow for such scoun∣drels  D Last  Don't call me out of my name  Ail  I can't sirrah  D Last  You did you did and I'll make you pay for it  Ail  Get out of my house  D Last  That's all I wantHe has push'd meI call you every one to witnessI'll swear to the assault  Friend  Take him away  D Last  As they are taking him away  I'll swear to the assaultand if I don't get redem∣nification  SCENE

'twere bold in me perhaps you'll say  To come to ask you how you like the play  Yet that's my business nay more free to make  I'm come to beg you'd like it for my sake  The author took me in his arms just now  My dear says hehe kiss'd me too I vow  If you'll go out and make the audience clap  I'll give you ribbons and a fine new cap  Besides he promis'd me next time he comes  Behind the scenes to bring me sugarplumbs  But whatsoe'er you think the play to be  When you go home I'm sure you'll talk of me  Says Lady Stingo to Sir Gilbert mild  "At FOOTE's Sir Gilbert have you seen the child  "'Tis really a  curosity  to view her  "Our little Betsy is a mountain to her  "Such action such a tongueand yet I query  "If she be five years olda very fairy"  Sir Gilbert answers with a pevish nod  "P'shaw let the little hussy have a rod  "There are old folks enough to play the fool  "Children my lady shou'd be sent to school"  And so they should the naughty ones no doubt  Who'll neither books

 Taking up and shewing her frock  But is my prate disliked for after all  I am but young 'tis true and somewhat small  And taller ladies I must needs confess  Might speak an epilogue with more address
