 HENRY the SECOND OR THE FALL OF ROSAMOND  Price One Shilling and SixPence  HENRY the SECOND OR THE FALL of ROSAMOND A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  Written by THOMAS HULL  Poor artless Maid to stain thy spotless Name  Expence and Art and Toil united strove  To lure a Breast that felt the purest Flame  Sustain'd by Virtue but betray'd by Love  SHENSTONE's ELEGIES  LONDON Printed for JOHN BELL near ExeterExchange Strand  MDCCLXXIV  PREFACE  I Hold it an indispensible Duty to mention some Circumstances which gave Birth to the following Scenes wherein I shall not only indulge my Pride but perhaps in some Degree palliate the Boldness and as it may be thought by many Presumption of my Understanding  The Fable and Conduct of this Tragedy were projected as long ago as the Year by  the late  Mr  Shenstone  at his sweet Retirement the  Leasowes  in  Warwickshire  Herein consists my Pride that I enjoyed a happy but too short Intimacy with that amiable and accomplished Man  In the Summer of that same Year  See Mr  Shenstone  's Letter No to Mr  Graves Sept    Mr  Shenstone  had been present at the Performance of a hasty Alteration of Mr  Hawkins'  s Tragedy of  Henry and Rosamond  which I produced at the Theatre at  Birmingham  for the temporary Use of a particular Friend Undigested and imperfect as it was that excellent Judge said there was a Pathos in the Story which notwithstanding the Defects of the Drama  made the Representation very pleasing and he signified his Wonder that such an affecting and  popular Tale  should not have found its Way to the Stage Hence arose many Conversations on the Subject all which terminated in his advising me  to make the Story my own  The known Kindness of his Heart perhaps gave me Credit for greater Abilities than I really possessed He continued to encourage me with a Warmth which flatters me in the Pecollection and after I had left  Warwickshire  obliged me with several Letters to the same Purpose which I still preserve as  valuable Relicts  In one of those Letters he suggested the Character of the  Abbot  in Order as he said to add a little more Business to a Story which otherwise might be too barren to furnish Matter for five Acts It may easily be supposed I forthwith adopted his Idea and carefully treasured in my Mind every Sentiment he let fall on this as well as other Subjects and I can say with great Truth that among the many Conversations I enjoyed with that excellent Man I never knew one from which I did not derive considerable Instruction as well as Delight  The unexpected Loss of this most estimable Friend  He died  Feb    which will ever be lamented by all who knew him dispirited me from the Undertaking  and I laid aside my Plan together with all his Letters till the Beginning of last Year The Scheme itself it is true had often in the Interval occurred to my Remembrance but a Doubt of my Ability to execute it even in a  passable  Manner deterred me from the Attempt  Mrs  Hartley  's Arrival at  CoventGarden  Theatre and the warm Solicitations of a Friend induced me once more to resume the Design The happy  Suitability  if I may be allowed the Phrase of her Figure to the Description of  Rosamond  as may be found in Dr  Percy  's amusing and instructive Collection of old Ballads Vol ii Page viz  Her crisped Lockes like Threads of Golde  Appear'd to each Man's Sight  Her sparkling Eyes c c  assisted by the Softness and Gentleness of her Demeanour encouraged me at length to make the Attempt and the unniverfal Aprobation given by the Public to her Appearance Manner and Performance on the first Representation of this Play happily convinced me I was not singular in my Opinion  In the general Execution of the Piece I have paid a particular Attention to the  old Ballad  and endeavoured at a Simplicity of Style both which Mr  Shenstone  earnestly recommended I am not conscious of any further Helps except having  adopted the Idea not the Matter of an Interview between the  King  and  Clifford  in the Monastery from Mr  Hawkins  I had originally made  Clifford  die of a broken Heart under the S  ction of the Death of  King Lear  as originally drawn by that great Master of human Nature  Shakespeare  but the general Opinion of the Public and the Persuasions of my Friends induced me to vary my Design in the Representation  I have little further to add but my Intreaties that the Reader will be pleased to judge with Lenity what was undertaken with Diffidence  Advised assisted and encouraged as I was originally to this Undertaking by the Possessor of such eminent Abilities and such Benignity of Disposition I seek no  living  Patron but pride myself in having this Opportunity to dedicate my humble Production  With the warmest Affection and Gratitude  TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE ESQ  Westminster January    Advertisement  THE Author would justly incur the Charge of Ingratitude were he not to return his warmest Acknowledgments to the  Public  for their very indulgent Reception of this Play to Mr  Colman  for his spirited and deservedly admired Epilogue and to the  Performers  for their Zeal and Assiduity in the Study and Support of their respective Characters  PROLOGUE  Written and Spoken by the AUTHOR  LONG Time oppress'd with painful Doubts and Fears  At length the dread decisive Hour appears  The awful Trial comes and here I stand  T' abide the Verdict of my native Land  Will not the Judge himself for Favour plead  When the poor trembling Culprit owns the De    When in false Arts he scorns to seck Support  But throws him on the Mercy of the Court  Such is my State whom will Ambition draws  To stand the Judgment of dramatic Laws  Bold the Attempt and much I fear in vain  That I the humblest in the Muses' Train  Should dare produce in this nicejudging Age  My own weak Efforts on the dang'rous Stage  Had I the slightest Touch of plaintive  Rowe  Whose Numbers oft have bade your Sorrows flow  Your Plaudit undismay'd I might implore  And  Rosamond  might plead like hapless  Shore  But as it is your Kindness be my Friend  For that alone I sueto that I bend  If by an artless Tale in artless Strain  A mild and patient Hearing I obtain  And my poor Labours o'er behold ye part  With unpain'd Ear and undisgusted Heart  'Twere Triumph and Delight but if the Lays  Deserve your Censure which aspir'd to Praise  Ev'n to your Kindness will I not presume  Nor strive to deprecate my proper Doom  This sole Indulgence let my Fault procure  Mildly inflict submissive I endure  CHARACTERS  HENRY II King of England  Mr SMITH  HENRY Prince of Wales  Mr WROUGHTON  CLIFFORD  Mr HULL  ABBOT  Mr CLARKE  SALISBURY  Mr GARDNER  VERULAM  Mr R SMITH  LEICESTER  Mr THOMPSON

House  Enter  CLIFFORD  and  SALISBURY  CLIFFORD  SALISBURY  no more seek not with empty Words  To talk down Grief like mine hadst thou a Child  Whom thy fond Heart had dwell'd and doated on  As mine on  Rosamond  and felt'st the Pang  Of seeing her devote her matchless Beauty  To lawless Love her Dignity and Virtue  To Infamy and Shame thou woud'st not brook  Vain Consolation  SALISBURY  Judge not I esteem  Thy Suff'rings light or think thy Pains will yield  To cold Philosophy  CLIFFORD  NoWou'dst thou ease  The tortur'd Wretch thou must sit down beside him  Shed Tear for Tear in sympathizing Silence  List to the Tale which Sorrow loves to tell  And by partaking the dislressful Cause  Sooth the strong Woe that will not be controul'd  SALISBURY  Give thy sull Bosom Vent thy Friend shall wait  With patient and participating Heart  CLIFFORD  I ask but that for shou'dst thou weary Language  Ransack the Stores of subtle Sophistry  For deepest Argumentsmy simple Answer  Confutes and baffles allI've lost my Child  SALISBURY  I grant it Lord and meant alone to stand  A friendly Mediator 'twixt thyself  And the o'erruling Tumults of thy Mind  I dread their Violence Did'st thou not talk  O  Vengeauce and Redress Whence shou'd they spring  Where wou'dst thou point them Say is this a Time  To add to  Henry  's Troubles now when dark  Intestine Feuds and foreign Foes combine  To shake his Throne and Peace  CLIFFORD  Cousin thou call'st  A Blush to these old Checks at the bare Thought  Of what thy Words imply Think'st thou I mean  Had this weak Arm the highest Power of Vengeance  To stain my native Land with civil Slaughter  No Heaven forefend nor should a Danger reach  My Sovereign's sacred Life Were there a Wretch  Accurs'd enough to raise his trait'rous Arm  'Gainst  Henry  's Breast  Clifford  would rush between  Oppose himself to the Assassin's Point  And glory in the Death that sav'd his King  SALISBURY  My Mind's at Peace  CLIFFORD  So rest it noble  Salisbury  Shall I be plain and tell thee all my Weakness  'Spite of ungrateful  Henry  's Perfidy  'Spite of the Sorrows that assail my Heart  I love him still I love this royal Robber  In early Youth I led him to the Field  Train'd his advent'rous Spirit shar'd his Dangers  And by his Side maintain'd my Country's Honour  In many a gallant Feat Oh hard Return  How hath he paid this Love  SALISBURY  When headlong Passions  Mislead him not from his instinctive Greatness  How nobly shews he Wisdom Learning Policy  Inform his Mind and gen'rous Honour sways it  CLIFFORD  Where was it fled that Guardian of Man's Heart  When with infidious Arts in evil Hour  He lur'd my chaste my duteous  Rosamond  From Virtue and Obedience Was she not  All that a Parent's fondest Wish could form  In vain her modest Grace and Diffidence  Bore the dear Semblance of her Mother's Sweetness  And promis'd an unsullied Length of Days  She's lost and the bright Glories of our Line  Are stain'd in her Disgrace  SALISBURY  Thy pious Heart  Alive to all the Dangers and Mishaps  That wait on tempting Beauty doth not need  My interposing Voice to wake soft Pity  For the lost  Rosamond  The Love of Goodness  Not wholly leaves the Breast that Error stains  But oft abides a wholesome Monitor  To call the miserable Culprit back  To its forsaken Laws So may it fare  With her 'Tis true the King when in her Sight  Engrosses all her Thoughts but in her secret  And solitary Hours sad she regrets  Her ruin'd Innocence and mourns that Love  Which led her to destroy a Father's Peace  And stain the Honours of a spotless Line  CLIFFORD  To save her from a deeper Plunge in Guilt  Is all my present Purpose 'gainst the King  No other Weapons do I mean to use  But those which best become the manly Heart  Reason and Conscience let him give her back  Stain'd and dishonour'd as the Mourner is  Let him restore her to these aged Arms  I ask no more  SALISBURY  Unfold thy utmost Wish  And if a Friend's Assistance may avail  Command thy Kinsman's warmest Services  CLIFFORD  Conceal my being here let not the King  Know  Clifford  treads these Bounds he must be won  To my Discourse unconscious who I am  I have devis'd a Meansenquire not now  But patient aid me and await the Issue  I have good Hopes that all the gen'rous Fires  Which warm'd his noble Heart are not extinct  If so I may once more embrace my Child  My still dear  Rosamond  Blame not my Weakness  I cannot lose the Father in the Judge  I seek not to inflict but banish Pain  T' awaken in her Breast a just Remorse  For her past Failings and entice her Steps  To some serene Abode where Penitence  And Contemplation dwell and jointly sooth  The contrite Sinner's Mind with glowing Hopes  Of Heaven's Indulgence and its promis'd Grace  Exeunt  SCENE II A retir'd Grove belonging to the Palace  Enter Prince of  WALES  and  LEICESTER  PRINCE  My Spirit will not brook it What avails  The empty Name and Title of a King  Without imperial Pow'r why with his Son  Divide his Throne unless he meant to grant  A Share of that supreme Authority  Which only lends Stability to Greatness  And gives its highest Lustreto be caught  With the gay tinsell'd Garb of Royalty  Befits an Ideot only let him know  That  Henry  's Son inherits  Henry  's Pride  And may in Time with daring Hand assume  What now he is debarr'd  LEICESTER  Your Wrongs are great  But be not too precipitate and rash  Lest you therein defeat the Means by which  You wish to gain Beware the watchful Eye  Of Curiosity besets our Paths  Speak not so loud  PRINCE  What Danger Shou'd the King  Himself o'erhear confront me Face to Face  I would not shrink mine Eye should not abate  Its angry Fire nor my sunk Heart recall  The smallest Drop of that indignant Blood  That paints my glowing Cheek but I wou'd speak  Avow proclaim and boast my settled Purpose  I have a double Cause to urge me on  A royal Mother's Wrongs join'd to my own  Do I not see her injur'd scorn'd abandon'd  For the loose Pleasures of a Wanton's Bed  His beauteous Minion whom embower'd he keeps  In  Woodstock  's mazy Walks Shall he do this  Unnotic'd unreproach'd yet dare to check  My honest Ardour He hath yet to learn  That Parent who expects his Son to walk  Within the decent Pale of rigid Duty  Should keep a heedful Watch o'er his own Steps  And by his Practice well enforce the Doctrine  He means to have him learn  LEICESTER  Yet check this Passion  And hear the Dictates of my cooler Mind  Is not the Council here conven'd this Morn  By  Henry  's Order to debate the Courtesy  Of the French Monarch who even now invites  Thy royal Presence to his gallant Court  On friendly Visit  PRINCE  Yesand here the Partner  In  England  's Throne waits till their mighty Wisdoms  Shall have determin'd what his Course must be  And deign to call him in waits like a servile  And needy Pensioner that asks a Boon  LEICESTER  Again you lapse into this wild Extreme  Forget a while Ambition and Revenge  And court cool Wisdom act the Politician  Play to their Humours yield to their Decrees  Use this French Journey as the happy Step  To mount to your DesiresTho' here depriv'd  Of Pow'r in  Normandy  your HalfKing Title  Enables you to scatter Favours round  Such as shall gain you popular Applause  And win your Subjects' HeartsThis Point obtain'd  All you can ask is yours you may command  Where now you sue and  Henry  's Self may fear  Your Potency and grant your highest Wish  PRINCE  By Heav'n thou hast inflam'd my eager Soul  With bright Imaginations of Renown  Of Conquest and Ambition I a while  Will try to sooth this proudly swelling Heart  Into mild Heavings and submissive Calms  For this great Purpose  LEICESTER  To your Aims devoted  I'll privily away and meet you there  Will worm myself into each Norman Breast  Pour in their greedy Ears your early Virtues  Your Love of them their Interest and Honour  Then join in any hardy Enterprise  That Forethought can suggest and win the Palm  Or die beside thee  PRINCE  Gen'rous gallant Friend  I have not Words to thank theeto my Breast  Let me receive the Guardian of my Glory  In full Assurance that his noble Friendship  Shall never be forgot  LEICESTER  Behold the Queen  She moves this way  PRINCE  I will retire a while  I would not meet her till this hop'd Departure  Be fix'd irrevocably lest her fond  Maternal Love and Softness might prevail  O'er that instinctive Yielding in the Breast  Which Nature wakens when a Mother sues  And win some Promise from my pliant Heart  That I should scorn to break  Exit  LEICESTER  What if I try  To win her to our Cause The frequent Wrongs  Which fire her haughty Mind join'd to Affection  For her young  Henry  may engage her Help  In any Scheme that promises Revenge  But softthe present is no Time for that  For with her comes that busy meddling Abbot  That Dealer in dark Wiles who rules and guides  The Consciences of all who weakly crouch  To his MockSanctity I will avoid him  Even now some Mischief broods within his Mind  Perhaps tow'rd me for he of late hath shewn me  Marks of Respect and Courtesy wherein  He was not wont to deal Time only will  Explain the Object of his present Aims  For in his  ProteusFace  or even his Words  No smallest Trace of what employs his Thoughts  Can ever be descry'd  Exit  Enter  QUEEN  and  ABBOT  QUEEN  Tell me no more  Of longprotracted Schemes and tedious Wiles  My Soul is all Impatience Talk to me  Of Vengeance speedy Vengeance  ABBOT  What can be  Devis'd to punish pain and mortify  Beyond what is enjoin'd on  Henry  's Head  Tho' distant from the venerable Shrine  Where martyr'd  Becket  's sacred Blood was spill'd  Is he exempt from Penance Doth not here  Our careful MotherChurch pursue her Foe  Is he not nightly doom'd to tread the lone  And solemn Isles of  Ida  's holy House  In deep Attonement for the barb'rous Fall  Of that dear murder'd Saint  QUEEN  And what attones  For  Eleanor  's loud Wrongs her murder'd Peace  Will all the Penances e'er yet devis'd  By dronish Priests relieve my tortur'd Heart  Will they recall my  Henry  's truant Love  Or blast the Charms of that deluding Witch  Who lures him from me This is the Redress  Which  Eleanor  demandsthis the Revenge  Alone which she can condescend to take  ABBOT  Nor is this past my Hope to purchase for you  My Thoughts devote to you and your Repose  Continually labour for your Good  Alas you know not mighty Queen the Sighs  My Heart has heav'd the Tears mine Eyes have shed  For your injurious Treatment and even now  Would you but bid your just Resentment cool  I think the wish'd Occasion is at Hand  That gratifies your most enlarg'd Desire  QUEEN  Thy Words are Balsam to my wounded Peace  Go on go on dwell on this pleasing Strain  And I will worship thee  ABBOT  Is not the Council  Conven'd by  Henry  Do they not decree  Your darling Son shall strait for  France  QUEEN  Ay there  Again is  England  's Queen insulted mock'd  Have I no Right of Choice Shall the dear Boy  Whose noble Spirit feels his Mother's Wrongs  Shall he be banish'd from me torn away  My only Comforter  ABBOT  He must not go  You must prevent itpractise every Art  Nay bid your Pride and fierce Resentment bend  To soft Request and humblest Supplication  Ere suffer his Departure  QUEEN  Tell me Father  How this is to be done Canst thou speak Peace  To the tumultuous Bosom of the Deep  When the loud Tempest tears it Can I meet  With patient Meekness my Oppressor's Sight  Wear an apparent Calmness in my Face  While heaving Anguish struggles in my Mind  It will not be  ABBOT  There are no other Means  What tho' the Council urge StatePolicy  And PublicGood for their Consent herein  Their inward Aim is to oblige the King  Who labours this great Point And what's his Drift  No courteous Scheme to please his Brother  France  But merely to remove the gallant Prince  QUEEN  Say'st thou  ABBOT  He fears a Rival in the Hearts  Of discontented Subjects the brave Youth  With Speech undaunted that disdains Disguise  Hath freely spoke your Wrongs Hence Jealousy  Broods in the King lest your aspiring Son  May prove in Time a Bane to his Pursuits  In wanton Dalliance and illicit Love  QUEEN  Is this the End of all his boasted Care  For my Son's Weal his Happiness and Honour  This the great Cause his Brother  France  must see  Th' allpraised Heir of  England  's mighty Throne  Oh  Henry  Whither is thy Greatness sled  Is thy bold Pride thy Majesty of Heart  Sunk in low Stratagems and mean Deceits  So will it ever be when Perfidy  Pollutes the Soul the Sense of Honour flies  And Fraud and Meanness fill the vacant Seat  ABBOT  Lose not the precious Hours in useless Reasonings  Speed to the Presence seize the first fair Moment  Hang on his Garment clasp his stubborn Knees  Foil Art with Art and practise every Means  To win the King from this abhorr'd Design  QUEEN  I go howe'er illsuited to the Task  I will essay itStoop exalted Heart  A Moment stoop and Tongue learn thou a new  An unbeseeming Lesson let the Cause  The noble Motive consecrate the Means  Remember  Eleanor  thou fall'st a while  To rise more glorious to record thy Name  Amid the fairest Legends of Renown  A brave Avenger of thy Sex's Wrongs  Exit  ABBOT  Go shallow Woman thy impatient Soul  That mounts to Frenzy at each slight Surmise  Of Injury makes thee a precious Tool  For deeplaid Policy to work withal  The Prince must here abidehis tow'ring Pride  And  Leicester  's hot and enterprizing Genius  Assisted by my subtle Aid may raise  A Storm that shall destroy this haughty King  This Poison to our Cause and holy Order  Henry  thou know'st not what a Foe thou hast  In this unmitigable Breastmy Soul  Abhors thee and will never know Repose  Till thou hast fall'n a Victim to my Rage  The greatest noblest Cause inspires my Deeds  Look down Oh sainted  Becket  with Delight  On thy true Servant Let thy blessed Spirit  Assist my Purpose while I seek Revenge  On him who dar'd insult our holy Faith  By instigating sacrilegious Hands  With thy dear Blood to stain our hallow'd Shrines  Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  an Apartment in the Palace  Enter the  KING  and  VERULAM  KING  TRUE  Verulam  and it must be thy Care  To check this growing Pride which mounts so fast  And like the forward Sapling boldly strives  To emulate the lofty Cedar's Height  Which long hath tower'd in unrivall'd Strength  The Glory of the Wood  VERULAM  That Zeal and Love  Which hitherto hath won my Master's Confidence  Long as the Lifeblood warms this aged Heart  Shall be employ'd to serve him but this asks  The nicest Caution soft Advice must sooth  His headstrong Spirit that on the least Surmise  Of an usurp'd Authority would start  Aside indignant of Controul  KING  To thee  Thy Love and Prudence we confide the Whole  Thy polish'd Sense thy Knowledge of Mankind  And long Experience render thee most fit  For this great Task  VERULAM  The Time of his Departure  Is it yet fix'd  KING  On our Decree alone  That Point depends he shall with Speed away  These rude Commotions that assail us round  May call us from our Realm should it prove so  He must not here remain his Stay were fatal  VERULAM  Not so I hope my Liege  KING  Prudence enjoins  Our strictest Caution What his own Ambition  Might of itself attempt we cannot say  But there's a farther Danger to be fear'd  VERULAM  His Virtues will defend him from such Deeds  As Honour and Obedience must alike  Condemn and he has Virtues which I trust  Will cast a Lustre o'er his rising Years  When the slight Indiseretions of his Youth  Are buried in Oblivion  KING  I trust so too  Yet  Verulam  where splendid Virtues grow  Great Errors also shoot his Time of Life  Is now in that capricious wavering State  When the soft Bosom is susceptible  Of ev'ry new Impression his Colleague  From whom we wish him sunder'd subtle  Leicester  Is ever at his Ear watchful to seize  Th' unguarded Moment of the youthful Heart  When dark Insinuations may prevail  Upon his ductile Mind Be thou in Readiness  On our first Notice  VERULAM  This important Point  Which waited only what this Morn hath given  The Council's Sanction hath been long debated  I am prepar'd my Leige  KING  Behold our Son  Enter the  PRINCE

learned Guides imperfectly convey  PRINCE  I thank my Father's Love the Council wisely  Bend to thy Will they but allot what else  Had been demanded by the future Heir  And present Partner in th' imperial Seat  My glowing Youth and kindling Spirit scorn  To live coop'd up within one scanty Bound  Would Life permit it were Delight to trace  Each scepter'd Region of the peopled World  To mark

Wish but rather join  To melt a Father's Heart  KING  'Twere useless Madam  Think who thy Husband is and what his Ties  How light how wavering must he appear  In public Eyes should he abjure the Point  He hath just labour'd Recollect thyself  Thou canst not wish him so to slight the Claim  Of Wisdom and of Honour  QUEEN  Nor the Claims  The soft'ning Duties of domestic Life  The Claims of Happiness of inward Peace  Which long my Heart hath sigh'd for  KING  Eleanor  Once more remember who we are a King  That will not brook to be arraign'd and school'd  For petty Indiscretions  Henry  judges  His own Misdoings and the Chastisement  Must be inflicted by his conscious Mind  Not the bold Railings of another's Tongue  QUEEN  I will be mild be patient be advis'd  I do recall my Words revoke each

Hopes I have of future Fame  I do not merit these ungentle Terms  Revoke thy Wordsresume those gentle Strains  Which wont to fall upon thy  Henry  's Ear  And Nature's Feelings will unfluice my Heart  In Blood to thy Complainings  QUEEN  Art not thou  Join'd with the rest a Foe to my Repose  See'st thou not how thy Mother is neglected  Abandon'd scorn'd Yet thou canst yield Obedience  To the Decrees of him who thus insults me  And leave me to my Wrongs  PRINCE  Can I oppose  A Parent's absolute Command Oh Madam  Think on my State how critically nice  'Twixt two such urgent Claims how hard to judge  I must resist a King and Father's Power  Or seem neglectful of a Mother's Woes  Judge me not so even while I own the Strength  Of this imperial Mandate and prepare  To speed for  France  I

my Defender  Or must I yield my Spirit to my Wrongs  And poorly die beneath them  PRINCE  Ere the Hour  Arrive that should behold that dire Event  I would myself redress thee wou'd excite  My Norman

Were to be lost again  ETHELINDA  He'll ne'er Consent  To yield you up resign you to your Woe  Unfriended unsustain'd to heave alone  The bitter Sigh and pour th' unpitied Tear  ROSAMOND  He says he will return to me and soon  Then paints the Anguish of his bleeding Heart  In unconnected Phrase and broken Periods  Adjures me by our Loves no more to urge  The hard Request on which his Life depends  Oh did I ever think I could refuse  What  Henry  ask'dbut thisIt must not be  Lend me thy Arm my Friend a sudden Faintness  Comes o'er me and instinctive Boadings whisper  I shall not long survive my  Henry  's Loss  ETHELINDA  Oh chide them from you at the sad Idea  My Sorrows stream afresh  ROSAMOND  Weep not for that  'Tis my best Comfort In the Grave alone  Can I find true Repose that quiet Haven  Whereto the wretched Voyager in Life  Whose little helpless Bark long Time hath strove  'Gainst the rude Beatings of tumultuous Guilt  Oft casts an ardent Look an eager Wish  To gain a Shelter there from future Storms  ETHELINDA  Let me conduct thee to the cheering Breeze  Thy Looks are pale  ROSAMOND  Oh thou that art all Mercy  Kneels  Look down indulgent on the Child of Frailty  With Pity view her Errors and instruct her  How to obtain returning Peace and Pardon  Enter  CLIFFORD  in his Disguise  CLIFFORD  Stay thee fair Mourner wherefore dost thou shun  The Messenger of Comfort

a fond Father's aged Breast and call  Her sinking Spirit from the Shades of Death  ETHELINDA  Oh reverend Stranger if thou be'st her Father  With gentle Voice allure her do not cast  The Frown of Anger on her meek Distress  Her Softness cannot bear it  CLIFFORD  Fear not Virgin  Assist to raise herthe returning Blood  Faintly renews its Course her timid Eye  Speaks painful Apprehension  ROSAMOND  Where is fled  That rev'rend Form even now it hover'd o'er me  Sent by kind Heav'n the sacred Delegate  Of Comfort and Protection  CLIFFORD  Rosamond  Oh turn not from medo not shun my Sight  In Pity shrink not from a Father's Eye  Who comes to chace thy Sorrows comes to shed  Some pious Drops o'er thy afflicted Heart  Ere he is mingled with the Dust  ROSAMOND  Thus lowly  Bent to the Earth with abject Eye that dares not  Look up to that much injur'd rev'rend Face  Let me implore thy Pardon  CLIFFORD  Rise my Child  Oh rise and let me gaze on that lov'd Form  Which once was all my Comfort  ROSAMOND  But which now  You look upon with Anger and Disgust  My Crimes deserve it all  CLIFFORD  Nay meet my Eye  Survey me well Dost thou behold therein  A rigid Judge Oh no the Father melts  In these faststreaming Tears  ROSAMOND  Has pitying Heaven  Heard the sad Prayer of such a guilty Wretch  And granted in the Moment of Affliction  A Parent's Presence and returning Blessing  To his repentant Child  CLIFFORD  Dost thou repent  And didst thou wish once more to see thy Father  Dry up thy Tears and answer me with Firmness  Dost thou repentHast thou the Fortitude  To break the fatal Tye that link'd thy Soul  To lawless Love and all its false Allurements  Canst thou look up with steady Resolution  To that great Power who loves repentant Hearts  And say thou wilt no more transgress  ROSAMOND  I can  I can my Father that allseeing Power  To whom thou hast appeal'd can witness for me  I have renounc'd the Paths of Sin and Shame  And mean to spend my sad Remains of Life  In deep Contrition for my past Offences  CLIFFORD  To find thee thus is Rapture to my Soul  Enter my Breast and take again Possession  Of all the Fondness that I ever bore thee  By my best Hopes when in thy smiling Youth  Aline Eye hath hung enamour'd on thy Charms  Thou shew'dst not then so lovelily as now  Dress'd in those graceful penitential Tears  ROSAMOND  Oh my Father  And may I still look up to thee with Hope  That the dear Love and Tenderness thy Breast  Once cherish'd for thy darling  Rosamond  Is not extinguish'd quite  CLIFFORD  Alas my Child  I am not lost to Nature and her Ties  We are all frail preach Stoicks how they will  'Tis not a Parent's Duty to cast off  But to reclaim the Wand'rer of his Blood  One Question more on that depends my Peace  Shall I behold my Child redeem'd from Shame  Or must I sink with Sorrow to the Grave  Ere this great Bus'ness of my Soul's accomplish'd  ROSAMOND  Command my Heart can I thus lost to Goodness  Assuage thy Cares and soften the Decline  Of weary Nature say my dearest Father  And by the Zeal of my Obedience prove  The Truth of my Contrition  CLIFFORD  Hear me then  Thou darling of my BosomWestward hence  On the slow Rising of a fertile Hill  A virtuous Dame of honourable Race  Hath sounded and endow'd a hallow'd Mansion  To pure Devotion's Purposes assign'd  No Sound disturbs the Quiet of the Place  Save of the bleating Flocks and lowing Herds  And the meek Murmurs of the trilling Stream  That flows sweetwinding thro' the Vale beneath  No Objects intercept the Gazer's Eye  But the neat Cots of neighb'ring Villagers  Whose lowly Roofs afford a pleasing Scene  Of modest Resignation and Content  There Piety enamour'd of the Spot  Resides there she inspires her holy Fervour  Mild not austere such Piety as looks  With soft Compassion upon human Frailty  And sooths the PilgrimSinner to embrace  Repentant Peace beneath her holy Roof  Say wilt thou quit for such serene Delights  This gay Abode of Shame

Midnight veils the Globe  Disguis'd as now in this religious Garb  Again expect me to redeem thee hence  And guide thy Steps to that Abode of Bliss  Here break we off  ROSAMOND  Once more thy Blessing on me  While I pour forth the silent Gratitude  Of my full Soul for thy returning Love  CLIFFORD  Warm as thy Soul can wish my Child receive it  Oh the supreme Delight 'twill be to see thee  Restor'd to holy Peace and soft Content  And sometimes share thy Converse then devote  My lonely Intervals to ceaseless Prayer  That Heaven will pour on thy repentant Heart  Its healing Mercy and its promis'd Grace  Exit  ROSAMOND  Propitious Power who chear'st the Mourner's Spirit  Accept my boundless Thanksthy pitying Goodness  Inspir'd my Father's Heart and sent him hither  To succour and sustain me Oh continue  Thy strength'ning Fervour that I may not shrink  From the great Task I have begun but rise  An Object worthy thy returning Grace  ETHELINDA  My gentle Mistress I partake your Transport  Yet Apprehension checks the rising Joy  What Agonies will pierce your  Henry  's Heart  ROSAMOND  Peace on thy Life seek not to wake again  Those Thoughts which I must hush within my Breast  The Lover is forgot what  Clifford  's Daughter  Leaves unperform'd  Clifford  himself will perfect  That Tongue whose wholesome Counsels  Henry  wont  In early Life to listen and obey  That Heart which lov'd his Virtues will again  Exert its Power and win him to applaud  The Minister of Peace who leads me hence  To that Asylum my Offences claim  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE  the Bower  Enter  ROSAMOND

Event  Should interrupt this Night's important Business  Creates false Terrors  ROSAMOND  Twice within this Hour  Hath it presented to my tortur'd Sight  My Father in the Agonies of Death  Gasping and pale and stretching forth his Hands  To me for Aid and Pity  ETHELINDA  When Suspense  And Expectation hold Dominion o'er  The agitated Bosom these Illusions  Are busy to torment us  ROSAMOND  Angels speed him  In Safety to me and console my  Henry  When he shall seek his  Rosamond  in vain  Around this oncelov'd Bower When thou behold'st him  O can it be a Crime to leave a Sigh  One soft Adieu for him who was so dear  Say  Ethelinda  that I left these Walls  Not with a harden'd but a tutor'd Mind  Not desp'rate but resolv'd arm'd with that due  That holy Resolution which becomes  My State and Purpose and when busy Memory  Recalls the sad Idea of our Loves  Too oft alas I fear 'twill press my Mind  I'll pour my fervent Pray'rs that Bliss and Honour  May crown the Hero's Days  ETHELINDA  I will do all  My Mistress bids but must I stay behind  Must I renounce the sweet Companionship  Her Gentleness and soft Humanity  Have taught me to esteem my highest Bliss  ROSAMOND  This once obeythis Night's great Business done  I claim no Duty more but when the Storm  Shall be o'erblown and all be calm again  If aught of Good befall my afterHours  Thou  Ethelinda  shall partake it with me  Go now collect together those dear Pledges  The only Treasure I shall carry hence  My  Henry's  Letters my o'erharrass'd Spirits  Would sink beneath the Task  Exit  Ethel  Illboading Fears

thee of thy Innocence of Heart  And taught thee to be Rival to a Queen  ROSAMOND  Most injur'd Majesty thus to the Earth  I bow myself before thee I consess  My heinous Crimes I sink beneath their Weight  Yet Oh take Pity on a hapless Creature  Misled by fatal Love immers'd in Guilt  And blinded to the Evils that ensued  QUEEN  And plead'st thou that in thy Defence fond Wretch  Which loudest cries against thee Knew'st thou not  Who  Henry  was what were his noble Ties  How did thy Passion dare aspire so high  Thou should'st have sought within thine own Degree  Mates for thy wanton Hours then hadst thou not  Debas'd a Monarch in his People's Eyes  Nor wak'd the Vengeance of an injur'd Queen  ROSAMOND  Alas thou look'st on me as on a Wretch  Familiar with Pollution reconcil'd  To harden'd Guilt and all its shameless Arts  I am not such Night's holy Lamps can witness  What painful Sighs my sad afflicted Heart  Hath heav'd what streaming Tears my Eyes have pour'd  To be releas'd from the pernicious Snare  Wherein I was involv'd  QUEEN  Those Sighs and Tears  Had true Contrition been their holy Source  Should have inspir'd thy Heart to break the Snare  And set itself at Freedom  ROSAMOND  O 'tis true  They should but in my rebel Breast they found  Too strong Resistance Love hath been my Fault  My Bane my Ruin long he held entranc'd  My fascinated Sense  O let this very Weakness plead my Cause  Within your royal Breast revolve great Queen  How you have lov'd and let those tender Feelings  Win you to pity me  QUEEN  Aside  What Witchery  Of Language hangs upon

What shall I do  To humble me yet lower in thy Sight  What Form of Language shall my Lips adopt  To move thy Mercy I confess my Crimes  Confess their Heinousness and sue for Pardon  Can I do more Ev'n Heav'n is won by Tears  By contrite Heart and fervent Supplication  Shalt thou be harder to appeaseO hear  A Woman's Weakness claims a Woman's Pity  Exert that Dignity of Soul that rises  Above Resentment to a pleaded Wrong  And teach me how to make Atonement  QUEEN  Hence  Aside  Encroaching Weakness coward Heart abjure it  Think on thy mighty WrongsArm thee to meet  My Words with noble Firmness Death alone  Appeases  Eleanor  's insulted Love  ROSAMOND  Death saidst thouDeathO yet  QUEEN  Behold Deluder  I will not stain me in thy Blood this Cup  Contains thy Doom  ROSAMOND  Oh do not bid me die  Steep'd as I am in Guilt clos'd in a Convent  Where Heav'n's clear Air and animating Light  Ne'er fond an Entrance let me be condemn'd  To all the Hardships ever yet devis'd  Or banish

black Revenge was pouring Torments on thee  O cruel Woman unrelenting Fiend  ROSAMOND  Calm calm thy Mind vent not thy Fury there  Her Wrongs cried loud and her great Heart is wrapt  In Sorrow for the Deed  KING  What now avails it  Compunction should have sprang when she beheld  The streaming Tears course one another down  Thy beauteous Cheek and read the speechless Grief  Of thy imploring EyesO

For a poor Wretch who justly thus atones  Her numerous Crimes O royal  Eleanor  Hear these last AccentsHowsoe'er I lov'd  However guilty I have seem'd to you  This very Night I had resolv'd to leave  These fatal Walls and by my Father's Guidance  Devote my future Days to Penitence  KING  Doth not thy Blood like mine halt in thy Veins  And chill the Seat of Life  ROSAMOND  Extend thy Pity  I cannot

with my mighty Woes  Taught by thy great Example  ROSAMOND  O my  Henry  Let not the sad Remembrance of my Fate  Sit on thy Heart nor call my present State  A Misery I wish'd some sure Retreat  From Grief and Shame and Heav'n hath heard my Prayer  QUEEN  Unhappy Victim of my blinded Fury  I almost envy thee thy present State  Thou soon wilt be at Ease while I must live  To all the Torments which a guilty Mind  Inflicts upon itself  KING  Canst thou feel thus  Yet couldst remain obdurate to her Tears  And deaf to her Intreaties  QUEEN  A Deed like this  Was foreign to my Heart had not the Fraud  Been pour'd into my Ears that I was meant  To be divore'd for ever from thine Arms  Be made an Outcast from thy Bed and Throne  That she might rise my Substitute in all  KING  What blacksoul'd

published early this season in order to complete this immortal author's works in the same elegant and convenient manner those therefore who wish to possess the first impressions of the future as well as the present plates are desired to forward their address as soon as possible to the publishers  London printed for John Bell near Exeter Change in the Strand and C Etherington at York  Mr BELL  I have purchased your edition of Shakespeare's Acting Plays with which I am abundantly pleased Your promises were large but your execution has been greater and I heartily hope that fuccess will not be slow in rewarding so spirited a performance Works of elegance though eagerly sought  after in foreign countries are rarely to be met with in our own the causes have been differently assigned but the present work plainly proves that they proce  d not so much from a dearth of abilities as from a want of spirit to encourage themYou have opened the road to excellence and I doubt not but your fellow traders though they have not spirit to project will have meanness enough to follow your stepsShould this be the case as I have some private reasons to believe it will with this very publication you may rest assured that the Public will always advert to the primary cause and support your improvements in spite of every undue influence which their extensive connections may be supposed to effect  I have sent a copy of the following Criticisms which are not my own sentiments alone but those of all whom I have conversed with on the subject to the St James's Chronicle which with this letter you are at liberty to make what use of you think proper without offending  your friend and wellwisher W R  January    J Bell's  respectful acknowledgements to the writer of the above and as it together with the following contains such flattering testimonies of candid approbation he hopes he shall stand excused by the Writer and justified by the Public for communicating both in this manner without trespassing on the confidence of either  CRITIQUE on Part of the PLATES in BELL's Edition of SHAKESPEARE  Excellent engraving is a beauty of itself and will always to the generality of people appear an ornament independent of the design or other qualities of a good print The French seem to have understood this better than any other nation  In imitation of the magnificent editions of the Louvre they have bedecked their ordinary books with cuts signets medalions head and tail pieces in the execution of which lies all their merit Neatness and propriety strike at once a superficial eye and therefore aiding their language with  the bagatelles  I have mentioned the Parifians are thought to have sold more books than any three cities in Europe  An edition of Shakespeare's acting plays being lately advertised I had the curiosity to glance at the proposals but coming to that part of the advertisement where five volumes with  elegant plates  are offered for fifteen shillings I pitied Shakespeare and thought no more of the work They are now published and afford a happy instance of what the public are to expect from a bookseller who has spirit to share his profits with artists of merit I had often thought of writing something  upon the present subject and cannot without injustice pass this new edition in silence  With exception of one or two at most these plates are highly finished finished with freedom and force united to the admired neatness of the French  Burin  I am sorry the designs are not upon the whole equal to the execution▪ though many of them merit the highest applause and since I have criticised the plates of former editions I shall make equally free with the present and praise or blame where in my opinion either is deserved  Othello  gives no idea of the noble Moor The expression of jealousy is too ambiguous and strong to be marked with success in miniature he looks not like an injured soldier but an old enraged eunuch of the seraglio  Iago  is an excellent figure his action steady the attitude speaks design and the eye watches the effect of his villany upon the unhappy husband  Brutus  and the  Evil Genius  would not make the ghost of a Roman between them it is a bad print and no part of it better than another  Rosalind  and her companion in the comedy of  As you like it  is one of the sweetest cuts I remember to have seen the action is well chosen the expression just and the execution delicate as the subject The softness of the sex shines through the masculine dress and finely conveys the idea of the poet Had the trees in the back ground been executed with a little more care and the keeping better preserved this print would have been a masterpiece  Every person must be pleased with  Pistol  in  Harry the fifth  the design is good the action naturalthe expression strong and the execution superior to any poetical cut I ever saw in an English publication  Iachimo  and  Imogen  deserve great approbation the seene is dumb
